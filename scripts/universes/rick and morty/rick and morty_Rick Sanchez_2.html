<html><p>Rick's current body is not even his own. His original body was killed during the events of "The Rickshank Rickdemption".
Rick has a planet fetish.
Jerry speculates that Rick may have more children besides Beth, due to his promiscuous lifestyle. This is later proven when Rick has a half horse human hybrid child with Po√±eta named Foal.
Rick has hinted that he has autism. Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon is also on the autism spectrum.
In the third season's premiere, Rick is referred to as the smartest being in the universe by the Gromflomite guards. This marks the first case of his title of The Smartest Man in the Universe being used. Rick was never called this in previous seasons. After this episode, however, several characters and even Rick himself refer to him as such.
During the episode "Mort Dinner Rick Andre," many things about Rick are revealed.
Rick has a nemesis called Mr. Nimbus. Mr. Nimbus seems to have vague connections to Rick's past.
Apparently, Rick originally had an assistant named Kyle. Nothing is known regarding Kyle, except that Mr. Nimbus prefers him over Morty.
Mr. Nimbus refers to Rick as Richard, possibly revealing this as his first name, with Rick merely being a nickname. However, Rick himself never confirms this.

Rick C-137 is atypical and unique from other Ricks in the show.
He did not have his own Smith family, as Beth C-137 was murdered as an infant by another version of Rick. Instead, he moves in with another Smith family abandoned by their version of himself, pretending he had returned.
Rick C-137 does not have a 'Morty C-137', as the Morty we follow through the show is from the Cronenberged Dimension. The only other Rick confirmed to not have his own biological Morty is Doofus Rick.
Many of the Ricks we see live amongst each other on the Citadel of Ricks, as a capitalist-like civilisation, with varying professions, social hierarchies and a governing democracy. However, C-137 is hostile to other Ricks, and regularly expresses hatred and apathy for governments and societies in general. He refused to join the Council of Ricks, instead becoming an inter-galactic rebel and a fugitive terrorist ("terror-rick"). Additionally, he has likely murdered hundreds of thousands of versions of himself - as shown in his backstory in "Rickmurai Jack", and during his destruction of the first Citadel of Ricks, in "The Rickshank Rickdemption."

It has been confirmed in "Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort" that Rick was born naturally with light blue hair.
