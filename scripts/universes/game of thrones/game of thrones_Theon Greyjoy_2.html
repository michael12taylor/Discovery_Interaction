<html><p>The seizure of Winterfell shows that Theon has tactical skills, but also that, like his father, he is a total ignorant in strategy. He fails to consider what Yara explains him very bluntly: that Winterfell is surrounded by hostile forces and too far from the sea, thus the ironborn garrison cannot be reinforced and eventually will be destroyed. Yara urges Theon to leave Winterfell, but he foolishly insists to keep his "prize", refusing to understand how poor his position is.

Even throughout Theon's "rule" of Winterfell, he is shown to be in a constant battle with himself, implying he knows deep down that invading his childhood home for his father was far from the right thing to do. Maester Luwin even points out to Theon that all of this is just an act to live up to his father's expectations and that Theon himself must know that his betrayal at Winterfell is wrong. Theon resignedly admits to Luwin that he is correct, but that he can't stop because he has already come too far to be forgiven, and refuses to join the Night's Watch, where all of his crimes would be forgiven, out of shame (and partially out of fear that Jon Snow might kill him in retribution for allegedly murdering Bran and Rickon). It is only after Theon becomes a prisoner of the Boltons and realizes that his father has no intention of rescuing him that he admits to himself and to Ramsay Snow that Ned Stark was his "real father" and laments Ned's execution in King's Landing.

After being tortured by Ramsay Snow in the dungeons of the Dreadfort for over a year, Theon's original personality has been seemingly obliterated, and he is little more than a broken and half-insane prisoner. Among various tortures, Ramsay cut off several of his fingers and toes, flayed off sections of his skin, and even had Myranda and Violet arouse Theon in order to castrate him. Ramsay even mockingly renamed him "Reek", physically and psychologically coercing Theon into denying his identity as "Theon Greyjoy" and accepting "Reek" as his new name and identity. Ramsay also psychologically tortured him with fake escape attempts or promises of rescue, before recapturing him. As a result, Reek thinks any possibility of escape or fighting back against Ramsay is simply another ruse. He lives in great fear of Ramsay, desperate to avoid angering him and is in such a state of traumatic shock that he is very withdrawn and submissive.

However, despite his previous actions, Reek appears to have retained a strong love and loyalty to the remaining Starks, demonstrated on several occasions: he is visibly shocked when Ramsay gloats about Robb's death, briefly holding a razor to Ramsay's neck and appearing on the verge of slitting his throat (though he doesn't, because Roose and Locke are present); he appears hesitant about telling them that Bran and Rickon may be sheltering at Castle Black with Jon Snow, knowing that it may lead to their deaths, but does so anyway to avoid angering Ramsay; he silently cries and briefly looks angry when Ramsay rapes Sansa, and does his best (or what he thinks is the best) to keep Sansa from angering Ramsay and suffering more at his hands, and even goes as far as to confess to Sansa that he deserved what he suffered under Ramsay and that he deserved to be Reek for what he did to the Stark family. However, when pushed too far, Theon ultimately abandons his Reek persona and chooses his loyalty to the Starks over Ramsay, by killing Myranda and helping Sansa escape from Winterfell, though still believing himself unworthy of anyone's forgiveness for betraying the Starks, who were the only ones who ever treated him like family.

Despite this admission, Theon still expresses shock after learning of his father's death when he returns to the Iron Islands. Though his sister Yara is still angry with him for refusing to be rescued, they reconcile when Theon offers to support Yara's claim to the Salt Throne. While initially despondent, Theon regains some of his confidence during the Kingsmoot to select the next ruler of the Iron Islands. Giving a brief rousing speech, he manages to convince many of the gathered Ironborn to join him in supporting his sister's claim to the Salt Throne, his speaking skills demonstrating that the original Theon Greyjoy is starting to resurface, though he and Yara are outmaneuvered by Euron, who wins many over by offering to seal an alliance with Daenerys Targaryen.

After escaping Euron with his sister Yara, Theon slides back into his despondent state and is troubled by his role in the death of the orphan boys; believing that he should hang for his crimes. Yara counsels him to rediscover himself so that they can secure an alliance with Daenerys and retake the Iron Islands from their uncle Euron. While negotiating with Daenerys, Theon does not display reluctance for the ironborn to cease raping, pillaging and reaving, and nods at Yara to tell her to agree with Daenerys, demonstrating that despite his recovery, he is still greatly traumatized by his torture by Ramsay, and apparently wishes to lead a more peaceful life in order to prevent it from happening again.

By the time of the alliance between Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen, Theon has shown himself to have changed with one particular act: he fought Harrag over the next move of the surviving ironborn. This act shows: Theon, who once demanded the respect of the ironborn he had not earned when he first returned to Pyke, approaches the ironborn as an equal and attempts to rally them to rescue Yara; he was willing to admit publicly that he was a coward to flee from Euron, something he never would have done previously; furthermore, Theon will fight to the death over what he believes, instead of fleeing or submitting as he has in the past. Even though Harrag was significantly stronger than him, he continued to fight, and when Harrag loses his advantage Theon seizes his chance and overpowers him, finally earning the respect of his sister's warriors. This shows that the Theon who betrayed House Stark, as well as the Reek who was a prisoner and lapdog of Ramsay Bolton, is dead and gone, and that the new Theon Greyjoy stands in his place, a brave and strong man willing to fight for what he believes in.

Behind the scenes
On the Season 2 Blu-ray, Theon narrates the Histories & Lore videos "Greyjoy Rebellion" and "House Greyjoy."
Alfie Allen, who portrays Theon, is one of several actors who originally auditioned to play Jon Snow, along with Iwan Rheon and Joe Dempsie. He lost to Kit Harington.
Florian Robin was a stunt double for Alfie Allen in the role of Theon Greyjoy.
In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Theon was a young boy when his father's rebellion was crushed and his two brothers were killed. He has one surviving sibling, his sister Asha (called Yara in the TV series).
Theon has been raised at Winterfell since the age of ten; of all the Starks, he has become close friends with Robb Stark. He considers Robb as a younger brother, more a brother to him than his brothers Rodrik and Maron; that does not stop him from betraying Robb, though.

In the beginning of the first novel, Theon is nineteen years old, five years older than Robb and Jon.

Theon is cordial but distant with the rest of the family, and has a bitter rivalry with Ned Stark's illegitimate son Jon Snow; both Theon and Jon are close with Robb, but Theon resents Jon because he is accepted and treated as a son by Ned despite being a bastard, while Jon dislikes Theon for his arrogance, highborn status and Robb's regard for him. In the show, Theon appears to be friends with both Robb and Jon.

Theon is known for his arrogance, as he is the heir to House Greyjoy, one of the Great Houses of Westeros, despite not having seen home in a long time. He is said to smirk a lot as if everything in the world amuses him.

During the first novel A Game of Thrones, Theon announces that "Lord Eddard is a second father to me," but that statement is far from the truth. His true feelings toward Eddard Stark are revealed in his first POV chapter in the second novel, A Clash of Kings: he muses that Eddard had tried to play the father from time to time, but to Theon, Eddard had always remained the man who'd brought blood and fire to Pyke and taken him from his home. As a boy, Theon had lived in fear of Eddard's stern face and great dark sword. In A Dance with Dragons, Theon recalls that as a boy, he once hoped that he would be betrothed to Sansa so Ned could claim him as a legal son, but that was just a child's fancy.

At one point, Theon notices a statue of a past Stark king from centuries ago in the crypts of Winterfell named Theon Stark, and remarks that he was his namesake - though it isn't clear if this was specifically true or if Theon was just speaking generally ("Theon" is not an uncommon name in history).

Theon does not have any happy childhood memories of his homeland. On the contrary, he remembers the Iron Islands as stern and stony places, scant of comfort and bleak of prospect; death is never far, and life is mean and meager; men spend their nights drinking ale and arguing over whose lot is worse, the fisherfolk who fight the sea or the farmers who try and scratch a crop from the poor thin soil. Moreover, his late brothers Rodrik and Maron used to bully him. Generally, his living conditions among the Starks were better conditions. Eddard spanked Theon only once after he bumped into Old Nan and knocked her to the floor, and that was almost tender in comparison to the beatings he used to receive from his brothers.

Soon after Theon is out of the Starks' control, he shows his true colors (in sharp contrast with his "sugarcoated" portrayal in the TV show): a ruthless sociopath villain, rapist and mass murderer, who has no qualms about harming innocent people simply because they are weak and defenseless, including small children; in short, the kind of villain the Mountain is.

When Theon arrives at Lordsport, full of himself, he expects a proper welcome as the heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands. Soon, however, he is deflated and disillusioned: no honor guard is waiting to escort him to Pyke, and nearly everyone around treats him coldly or mockingly, or even ignores his presence. His statement about inheritance rights is scornfully dismissed as "the laws of the green lands" (which do not bind the ironborn) by his uncle Aeron, father and sister. Theon realizes that he is considered not only as a foreigner among the ironborn, but worse - as a soft boy from the green lands. Dagmer is the only one who treats him fondly; he explains to Theon that his father does not know him well, since without his three sons - Asha was his only solace, and he got used to rely on her. He encourages Theon by claiming that there will be other wars, and he shall do great deeds.

Theon's initial raid at Stony Shore is the start of the overall ironborn invasion. The outcome is luridly described: bodies have been looted and mutilated. Of the fishing village, nothing remained but cold ashes that stank when it rained. The men had been put to the sword, all but a handful that Theon had allowed to flee to bring the word to Torrhen's Square. Their wives and daughters had been claimed for salt wives, those who were young enough and fair. The crones and the ugly ones were raped and killed. If they had useful skills and did not seem likely to cause trouble, they were taken to be thralls. After this "victory", Theon proceeds to capture Winterfell.

The conquering of Winterfell occurs similarly to the show, except that three of the servants are murdered (in compliance with Jojen's dream): Alebelly the guard, Mikken and Septon Chayle. Theon murders Chayle himself, not for resisting, but because "you and your gods have no place here now."

At Theon's order, a tavern wench named Kyra is brought to Winterfell. Theon keeps her as a bedwarmer. As Theon's position at Winterfell deteriorates, he becomes so furious and frustrated, that takes it out on Kyra: he climbs on top of her and rapes her very brutally with a fury he'd never known was in him; by the time he finishes, she is sobbing, her neck and breasts covered with bruises and bite marks. Then he shoves her from the bed and tells her to get out.

When Theon took Winterfell, he freed a prisoner named Reek - actually Ramsay Snow in disguise. Theon accepted Ramsay at his service, unaware of his true identity. It was Ramsay, not Dagmer, who advised Theon to kill two unnamed miller's sons as a cover-up for the escape of the Stark boys (the mother of the two unnamed boys was also killed at Theon's command). After Asha left Winterfell, leaving Theon with only seventeen men, Ramsay suggested to bring reinforcements; and Theon reluctantly agreed, though he did not fully trust him.

Ser Rodrik rallied reinforcements and besieged Winterfell. Theon went to parley with him, after ordering his men to put a rope around Beth Cassel's neck. Theon spoke arrogantly to Ser Rodrik, demanding him to swear fealty to Balon as the king and to Theon as the prince of Winterfell. Filled with disdain at Theon's arrogance and the way he treated Beth, Rodrik called Theon a "viper" and "Theon Turncloak" (the latter phrase has become Theon's derogatory nickname). Theon threatened to hang Beth and an additional hostage every dawn and dusk. Returning to Winterfell, he was aware of his hopeless situation: hanging Beth would provoke the storming of Winterfell, and failing to hang her would hollow out future threats. Maester Luwin suggested to Theon that he surrender and take the black. Theon liked this suggestion, albeit not as the selfless act of redemption as Luwin intended. Instead, Theon fancied himself becoming the chief of rangers, or even the glorified Lord Commander. As Lord Commander, Theon believed he could captain ships, and have sex with many wildling women. While he reminded himself that Benjen Stark and Jon Snow both voluntarily joined the Watch, he fails to consider that Jon might kill him for the latter's atrocities.

Ramsay returned with 600 Bolton men - they were welcomed by the other Northerners, but promptly turned on their allies. What followed was not a true battle but a massacre as Rodrik and his army were killed in their own camp. Having broken the siege, Ramsay rode into Winterfell - only then did he reveal his true identity to Theon. Without provocation, Ramsay punched Theon with a mailed fist so hard that it broke his jaw, then ordered his men to kill the remaining ironborn, as well as the Stark servants and commoners of the castle, and to burn everything. As he faded out of consciousness, Theon watched helplessly as the Dreadfort soldiers killed Black Lorren and Maester Luwin. The last thing he saw was his horse Smiler, screaming and rearing, his mane on fire.

Due to his actions, mainly the alleged killing of Bran and Rickon, Theon earned the hatred of the people in the North, and put himself to shame and disgrace in the eyes of the ironborn. Ever since he is referred to as Theon Turncloak.

In the novels, Theon's actions at Winterfell have a significantly greater effect on Robb's eventual downfall than in the show: the alleged murder of Bran and Rickon causes Robb to have sex with Jeyne Westerling out of grief; afterwards, Robb feels honor-bound to marry her, and thus he breaks the alliance with the Freys, setting into motion the chain of events that would ultimately lead to the Red Wedding. Moreover, the grief over Bran and Rickon causes Catelyn to release Robb's most important captive, and that rash act results in the loss of the Karstark troops, which makes Robb's position even worse. Thus Theon unwittingly serves as a catalyst of the Red Wedding, although he has no idea of it and it has never been his intention (very similarly to the way Ramsay unwittingly serves as a catalyst of the mutiny at Castle Black in the novels, by sending the Bastard Letter).

Theon does not appear at all in the third and fourth novels, and he is only mentioned briefly. In A Storm of Swords, Roose Bolton tells Robb and Catelyn that Theon is held prisoner at the Dreadfort, and is being tortured by Ramsay. Roose shows them a piece of skin, claiming it is from the little finger of Theon's left hand, which Ramsay enclosed to the letter Roose received from him. Robb says sharply that he wants Theon's head, not his skin. Roose suggests to keep Theon alive until the North is liberated from the ironborn in order to demand concessions from them, and Robb reluctantly agrees. Since Roose turns to be a traitor and most of his report is revealed to be false, it is unclear to the readers if he lied about Theon too.

In A Feast for Crows, Theon is mentioned several times. Most of the ironborn, including his sister Asha presume he is dead, but are uncertain since his body was never found. Ramsay never sends a taunting letter to Balon in the books, so no one knows if he is even alive, or if he is, where he is being held. Ramsay does send a warning message to Asha, to which he encloses a piece of Theon's skin (not any body part) without specifying Theon's status, but it happens much later. Neither Asha nor anyone else ever intend to try to rescue him. Asha herself actually did return to Winterfell with a few soldiers after the Bolton army withdrew, in the hope that Theon may have survived by hiding, but all they found were badly mutilated bodies, which convinced Asha that Theon was probably dead. Even if she knew that he was alive, and specifically at the Dreadfort, the Boltons' castle is so strong (and located on the other side of the entire continent) that it was actually logistically impossible to mount an assault on it with a few longships.

In A Dance with Dragons, it is finally revealed Theon is alive and has been imprisoned in the Dreadfort since the Sack of Winterfell. Theon's torture by Ramsay is only revealed in flashbacks throughout the fifth novel, but the TV series chose to present these events in the chronological order that they happened. Had they done it in the order that the books did, Theon would have disappeared after the Season 2 finale, and only reappeared again in the Season 5 premiere. The books don't directly state that Ramsay castrated Theon, though it was vaguely implied that he had.

Ramsay's torture of Theon serves no real logical purpose, and he is only doing it out of pure sadism. He basically just picked Theon at random - indeed, part of Ramsay's sadistic glee in torturing people is outright gloating that it isn't happening for any reason whatsoever. The only possible reason to keep Theon alive instead of simply killing him, but not inform the ironborn that he was held captive, might have been to throw the ironborn into internal conflict over who exactly Balon's heir was (as both Asha and Theon's uncles felt they were actually Balon's heirs, due to the unusual succession laws in the Iron Islands). Even if Ramsay emasculated Theon in the books, this doesn't necessarily mean that he cannot "further the Greyjoy line." Unlike the honorable Robb Stark or Jon Snow, Theon greatly enjoyed having sex with prostitutes (as also seen in the TV continuity when he has sex with Ros); Theon has at times mockingly remarked that he may have bastard children that he doesn't know about. He also had sex with the Captain's daughter in the books (who outright wanted him to take her as his salt wife), and specifically joked to her that if she became pregnant, it would be an honor to have a future king's bastard. So far in the books, however, there has been no mention of Theon fathering any known bastards.

Theon's story is largely the same as portrayed in the fifth season. One difference is that rather than marrying Sansa Stark, Ramsay marries Sansa's friend Jeyne Poole, who is being passed off as Arya. Theon knows immediately that it is not really Arya, and suspects that the Boltons have kept him alive because they need him to confirm to the Northern lords that it is her (since Theon is one of the few people still living who could positively identify Arya). Ergo, Theon ends up helping Jeyne escape from Winterfell, aided by a disguised Mance Rayder and his six spearwives. During the escape, Jeyne screams and accidentally gives away their position. Mance and the spearwives stay behind to buy them time, and Theon and Jeyne jump off the castle walls. They survive the fall and manage to reach the approaching army of Stannis Baratheon, and Theon is re-united with his sister Asha, who does not even recognize him. For the first time in years, he introduces himself as Theon Greyjoy rather than Reek.

As Reek
Theon's physical appearance has changed extremely during his imprisonment at the Dreadfort, to the point that even his sister cannot recognize him: he looks like he has aged many years; has lost three stones (42 lbs.) in weight; his hair turned white and brittle; his skin turned pasty; many of his teeth have been broken or loosened, because Ramsay did not like his smiles; he horribly stinks; Ramsay has cut three of his fingers and four of his toes. As a result, Theon cannot chew solid food, cannot use a bow, and hobbles grotesquely. When Asha sees him, she thinks he is some toothless old man, thinner than a scarecrow, his face resembling a skull.

Theon lives in constant fear of his cruel master. He knows that no matter how he acts - defiantly or obediently - Ramsay will torture him, simply because he can. He keeps reminding himself that his name is Reek, and suppresses any memories of his former life. After his unsuccessful attempt to escape with Kyra, whenever there seems to be a chance of getting away - Theon quickly dismisses it, certain that it is one of Ramsay's cruel games.

Theon loses track of time during his imprisonment. It seems to him that years, maybe decades, passed since he was brought to Dreadfort. Only when Ramsay squires, "Big" Walder and "Little" Walder Frey, come to take him to Ramsay - he realizes that only several months passed.

Theon is totally unaware of the events outside Dreadfort, among them his father's death and the kingsmoot. Even if he knew, it probably wouldn't matter to him, because he had much more urgent things to worry about - like his body parts.

Theon's life means nothing to him. He wouldn't commit suicide but welcomes any chance for a swift end to his miserable existence (like the time he approaches Moat Cailin, totally exposed to arrows). When he realizes Stannis intends to kill him, he finds the thought queerly comforting; he urges Stannis to do it quickly before Ramsay arrives.

In one aspect Theon has not changed at all - morally. He muses that he should have died with Robb, but it is his only regret. Other than that, he does not feel even the slightest remorse or regret about of the atrocities he committed (like the extremely brutal rape of Kyra), and does not feel any sorrow about any of his victims. He does not take responsibility for any of his vile deeds and never blames himself for his predicament, only others - his sister, father, Ramsay. He even blames the servants of Winterfell for not assisting him to hunt down the Stark boys, thinking how much he was "kind" to them. Generally, he sees himself as a poor innocent victim who never harmed anyone and does not deserve the suffering he has been through.

The only of Theon's victims that he acknowledges as such are the miller's sons, whom he dismisses nonchalantly as "It was not Bran we killed. It was not Rickon. They were only miller's sons." About their mother, who begged in vain for mercy before being murdered too at Theon's command, he remembers very clearly the occasional sex they had and how her breasts looked like - but not her death. He similarly disregards his other victims (the people of Stony Shore, Benfred Tallhart, Alebelly, Chayle, Mikken, Farlen, etc.).

Theon has not even abandoned his despicable habit of kicking dead bodies: in the beginning of the series he kicked the severed head of the deserter, laughing as if it was a ball; long afterward, when he came to Moat Cailin, he kicked twice a dead ironborn.

Theon's lack of remorse is shown also in his POV chapter of the sixth book: first, he convinces himself that Ramsay forced him to kill the miller's sons. This is a lie, because at that point of the story - Ramsay was not in a position to force Theon to do anything; he suggested that but Theon was the one in charge, and he made the decision, thus the blood of the boys (and their mother) is on his hands, not Ramsay's, but Theon wouldn't admit that. Second, he assures Stannis that the North remembers the Red Wedding, the sack of Winterfell, Deepwood Motte and Torrhen's Square - but leaves out the atrocities that he performed (the harrying of the Stony Shore and the taking of Winterfell).

Even when Theon is out of Ramsay's grasp, he cannot get rid of the deep fear of him; whenever someone (Stannis, Asha) refers to Ramsay as "the bastard", Theon automatically exclaims, "Never call him that!."

In the novels, "Reek" was actually the name of Ramsay Snow's servant. His real name might have been "Heke", but he was called "Reek" because he stank like rotting fish, apparently from some kind of medical condition, as the smell lingered no matter how much he bathed. When Ser Rodrik attempted to arrest Ramsay, he quickly switched clothes with his servant, so Rodrik ended up killing the servant while Ramsay passed himself off as Reek, and went back with them to Winterfell just before Theon's ironborn captured it. Ramsay later mockingly tortured Theon physically and psychologically until he was brainwashed into thinking he actually was Reek, and denying he was ever Theon. Or rather, Theon constantly reminds himself in his inner POV that "I am Reek", because when he showed any hint during his torture that he still considered himself "Theon" Ramsay would flay him again (Ramsay didn't just want him to say the words "I am Reek", but wanted him to even stop consciously thinking of himself as "Theon Greyjoy"). This subplot was cut from the TV series for screentime, and instead has Ramsay simply come up with the name "Reek" on a whim to demean and dehumanize Theon, noting that he stinks from being in the dungeons for so long, but Theon comes to insist that his name is Reek partly out of regret for the atrocities he committed against the Starks as Theon Greyjoy.

In A Dance with Dragons, Theon's reunion with his sister Asha occurs under different circumstances. Instead of returning to the Iron Islands, Theon and "Arya Stark" (actually Jeyne Poole) are brought to King Stannis Baratheon's camp. Asha has been taken captive by King Stannis following the liberation of Deepwood Motte. By that stage, the Kingsmoot has already occurred and Euron is already leading the ironborn invasion of the Reach. In a reversal of their encounter in the books, Asha does not recognize her brother, who has been battered and disfigured by Ramsay Bolton. When Asha realizes that scrawny, stinky, toothless old man is in fact Theon, she reacts with shock and disgust.

In a sample chapter from The Winds of Winter, Theon is put in chains by Stannis, who questions him about the Boltons' strength and numbers. Theon provides as much information as he can, and warns Stannis not to underestimate Ramsay. Stannis plans to execute Theon eventually, in order to secure the loyalty of the remaining Northern lords, who are furious at Theon for apparently murdering Bran and Rickon. Theon reacts indifferently, not even trying to tell Stannis the truth that he actually didn't kill Bran and Rickon, actually hoping that Stannis will kill him and end his suffering, and partially out of guilt for betraying Robb (to the point that in A Dance with Dragons, Theon's inner thoughts reveal that he believes he should have been at the Red Wedding, where he would have died valiantly at Robb's side and not ended up living as Ramsay's broken slave). Asha pleads with Stannis to spare her brother's life. When that fails, she petitions Stannis to spare him an agonizing death through fire by beheading him instead.

In the television series, Theon escapes the North, returns home and travels to Meereen, implying that in the books, he will not be killed by Stannis and may very well escape captivity along with Asha, possibly around the same time as Stannis's possible coming death in the books, though it remains to be seen, as Theon's role in the series has been merged with Victarion's from the novels.

Even if Theon somehow escapes, the chances that he'll die similarly to his analogous show character are extremely low: he is a total wreck, due to Ramsay's torturing, so he cannot fight or shoot arrows; more importantly, he does not feel any remorse about the atrocities he committed, and does not feel that he must make up for them.

 In Season 1's episode "The Wolf and the Lion", Theon says "I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old"; in the same episode, Robert says "We haven't had a real fight in nine years" - referring to the Greyjoy Rebellion, as in novels - thus Theon is 17 years old in Season 1. This also means TV-Theon is one year older than Robb and Jon, as in the novels. By Season 8, he should be approximately 24 years old.

 In sharp contrast to Theon, Jaime has changed greatly as a result of the abusing he received and became a much better person (in the books, not in the show): he learned his lesson; he accepted his maiming as a just punishment; he took full responsibility for his vile deeds; ever since he lost his hand - he has been doing his best to save innocent people, amend wrongs and prevent bloodshed - successfully.
