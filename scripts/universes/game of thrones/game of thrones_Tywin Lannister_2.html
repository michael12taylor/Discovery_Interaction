<html><p>Although Tywin's skill at politics and administration cannot be denied, his military record is mixed. During Robert's Rebellion, Tywin participated in none of the battles except his infamous sacking of King's Landing, when it was already clear that Robert Baratheon would win the war. During the Greyjoy Rebellion, Tywin lost his entire fleet to a surprise attack by Euron Greyjoy, and in the War of the Five Kings he badly underestimated Robb Stark and was repeatedly outmaneuvered on the battlefield (though on at least one occasion this was due to an incompetent subordinate). However, Tywin later turned the tables by winning a spectacular victory at the Battle of the Blackwater (thanks in part to his new alliance with House Tyrell), and although his actions at the Red Wedding, the destruction of House Reyne, and the Sack of King's Landing were extremely brutal and heinous, they produced decisive military results. While Tywin might not be much of a field commander, he is certainly a good strategist: he always has the endgame in mind, and always knows how to best inspire fear in his enemies.

While not trusting even his own small council—telling Tyrion to execute Varys, Pycelle, or Baelish on "even a whiff of treason"—Tywin is also much more diplomatic than Cersei or Joffrey. While he doesn't trust any of the Great Houses apart from his own, Tywin recognizes it as necessary to make some concessions to House Tyrell and House Martell in order to keep their valuable support. Following his death, however, Cersei spurns the Martells and re-ignites her previous rivalry with Margaery Tyrell, eventually destroying both alliances and undoing Tywin's careful work in securing House Lannister.

Tywin is a very efficient ruler, but has five flaws:

He always seeks to promote the interests of his house, even at the expense of the realm (for instance, he wouldn't forgive the crown's debt to House Lannister).
His methods are overly cruel: he employs extremely brutal warriors like the Mountain and Lorch, gives them a free hand in committing atrocities while fulfilling his orders, and has no qualms about killing small children, infants or even whole houses.
Even though Tywin was powerful and respected, his power was only built on fear, which made his house vulnerable after his death.
While he kept saying that the most important thing is family, also his relationship with his children was based on authority and fear: he always treated them as tools for his plans and he always acted under the assumption that they were meant to do what he wanted because he was their father. In fact, what he actually prioritized was his legacy, so he forced them into political marriages and berated them for being selfish when they refused to accomplish this goal. Even though it was probably true that his legacy's greatness meant his family's greatness, at the end all this was simply what he wanted and not necessarily what his family needed.
Tywin's power, arrogance and stubbornness made himself to believe that he was more superior than anyone or anything, even the gods, old and new. Committing acts, like the Red Wedding, believing that no consequences would follow with his actions, even disregarding the words "The northerners will never forget", never realizing that his hold on the North would be lost and his house would be brought into a dangerous situation by his power-mad daughter.
In the end, his endless prioritizing his legacy over his children ended up destroying his goal and killing him too: after many years of abuse, hate and disrespect, Tyrion killed him and this, thanks to Cersei's foolishness and selfishness, destroyed Cersei herself, Jaime and the rest of the family. All this can be attributed again to Tywin's arrogance, because he never believed that any of his children could truly oppose to him, or even killing him, and also he never truly understood how far Cersei was willing to go for power. Ironically, Olenna's relationship with her granddaughter Margaery showed how Tywin could have been able to relate with his children without being mean, authoritative or cruel; but again, his fiercely conservative nature prevented him from understanding how much a positive relationship with them was important and, especially, useful to control them.

Now the head of House Lannister, Lord Paramount of the Westerlands and Lord of Casterly Rock is Tyrion, the son who Tywin never wanted to be his heir even though everyone, apart from Tywin himself and Cersei, acknowledged as the most suitable for the role, perhaps even better than Tywin himself would ever have been.

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Tywin is a ruthless, pragmatic leader and a formidable general and strategist, although he prefers to orchestrate events from behind the scenes rather than leading from the front.

Tywin is not a POV character in the novels; his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of Tyrion and Jaime.

Tywin has four siblings: Kevan, Gerion, Tygett and Genna. His father, Lord Tytos, was a weak ruler who was mocked by many of his vassals, and dominated by his mistress - a woman who was scarcely above a whore. As a result, Tywin has grown to be a hard and cold man, who mistrusts laughter, and hates whores.

According to Tywin's sister Genna, he smiled on a very few occasions: when he married Joanna; when Aerys made him his Hand; when Tarbeck Hall came crashing down on Lady Ellyn; and at Jaime's birth.

When Tytos agreed to marry his daughter Genna to Walder Frey's son Emmon, who was his second son and thus not even his heir, simply to please Lord Frey, Tywin was the only one who spoke out against this, pointing out how drastically uneven the match was: even if Walder had offered his eldest son and heir in marriage, it would still have been marrying beneath Genna's station. Genna appreciated the fact that her elder brother who spoke against the betrothal.

When House Reyne of Castamere and House Tarbeck of Tarbeck Hall rose against House Lannister, young Tywin led his House's armies and crushed the revolt. He executed every member of the rebel houses, completely extinguishing them, and put their castles to the torch. The Reyne rebellion inspired the song The Rains of Castamere, which became an anthem of sorts for House Lannister, and served as a potent warning to all those who considered crossing Lord Tywin. When House Farman became recalcitrant, Tywin sent him a man with a lute who began playing "The Rains of Castamere." Lord Farman took the hint and caused no further trouble.

He was the Hand of the King under King Aerys II Targaryen for twenty years. Tywin's term in office as Hand of the King was very successful, to the point that he was essentially the only man holding the kingdom together as Aerys grew increasingly more insane over the years. Aerys also became increasingly jealous of his Hand. The TV series does not state this, but the reason the Mad King had Ilyn Payne's tongue torn from his mouth with hot irons was because he overheard Payne remarking that Tywin was the real ruler of the kingdoms. The intense relationship between king and Hand escalated to the point that other lords knew the easiest way to appeal to Aerys was to mock Tywin; as Kevan states decades later, Tywin maintained stability in the Seven Kingdoms to the best of his ability, but all it earned him was a mad king's envy.

A string of insults from Aerys eventually prompted Tywin's resignation. First, Aerys behaved indecently toward Joanna (there were unverified rumors that Joanna was briefly one of Aerys's mistresses). Next, the Crown Prince Rhaegar was betrothed to Elia Martell, rather than Cersei as Tywin had hoped. The King remarked: "a man does not marry his heir to his servant's daughter." Then, Jaime was named to the Kingsguard, which deprived Tywin of his first born heir, as Kingsguard vows prevent them from marrying and inheriting titles, and also effectively gave the King a hostage for Tywin's good behavior (Tywin had no idea that Cersei initiated that appointment, so that Jaime would be near her). When Aerys pettily refused to allow Jaime to compete in the great tourney at Harrenhal, it was the final straw and Tywin resigned and returned home to Casterly Rock. Thereafter, Aerys's rule rapidly spiraled out of control, which in turn only fueled the Mad King's paranoia.

When Robert's Rebellion erupted, Tywin remained neutral, ignoring pleas from both the Crown and the rebels for his aid. Only after the decisive Battle of the Trident, which all but assured the rebels of victory, did he call his banners and march on King's Landing. Pycelle convinced the King that Tywin had arrived to protect the capital. However, when the Lannister army was admitted, they proceeded to sack the city and murdered the royal family. Gregor Clegane personally killed Rhaegar's infant son by bashing his head in, then - while covered in the blood and brains of her baby - raped and killed Rhaegar's wife Elia Martell. Meanwhile Amory Lorch, another of Tywin's bannermen, killed the three year old Princess Rhaenys by stabbing her to death many times. The children's bodies were then presented to Robert as proof of House Lannister's loyalty to the new regime. Tywin later explained to Tyrion that such a demonstration of loyalty was necessary, as he had played no part in the war until it was almost over, and Robert would have been grateful that he had been spared from having to murder the royal children himself. Tywin did, however, concede that there was no need to kill Elia, as she was not a Targaryen. He opined that Gregor probably killed her purely out of cruelty merely because he not been specifically ordered to spare her.

This action spawned the original friction between House Lannister and Ned Stark, who correctly observed that the Lannisters only intervened when it was convenient, and that they could not be trusted. Further, Ned was disgusted that the Lannister army had dishonorably sacked the city and even killed Rhaegar Targaryen's small children (as Aemon recounts to Jon in the TV series). Tywin's defense when confronted by Ned was that he never personally ordered Gregor to kill the royal children, but Tywin also did nothing to punish Gregor. It is Ned's disgust at Tywin's actions during the Sack of King's Landing that drive how he deals with Cersei's betrayal, because even if Cersei's children are bastards born of incest, Ned knows that Robert would have all three killed if he told him, and Ned fears that this would make himself no better than Tywin.

Tywin pledged fealty to Robert in the aftermath of the conflict, and Robert agreed to marry Tywin's daughter Cersei. Tywin is proud of his son Jaime, a great warrior, but loathes his youngest son Tyrion, unjustly blaming him for the death of Tywin's wife, Joanna, in childbirth.

The books do not make it clear whether Tywin is aware or not of the incestuous relationship between Jaime and Cersei; he might have been aware, but preferred to shut his eyes to it, in contrast to his wife who took immediate steps to separate between Jaime and Cersei as soon as she found out about them.

Jaime has always been Tywin's favorite child (since Jaime disappointed him the least of all his children) - as long as Jaime obeyed him. This changes in the third novel, as a result of the extreme change in Jaime's personality: after he returns to King's Landing, Tywin demands that he quits the Kingsguard and take his place as the heir of Casterly Rock. Jaime, sick and tired of the corruption, injustice and political manipulations around him, refuses to act as his father's puppet anymore and exclaims in rage "I am a knight of the Kingsguard. The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard! And that's all I mean to be!." Tywin, furious that his own son dares to speak to him so defiantly and disrespectfully, answers harshly "You are not my son" (almost the same words he told Tyrion, after the latter shot him). This is their last conversation in the books. Kevan tries to make peace between them, but in vain.

Tywin's actual position on female members of his family taking part in political decisions is somewhat ambiguous in the books - particularly because Tywin's behavior is noted within the narrative for being hypocritical and at times contradictory. He does act like a very conservative and patrician male head of his household, but other characters remark that his love for his late wife Joanna was so great that she was actually his closest advisor. In her adult life, Tywin seems to have shunned Cersei from politics, but this was not always the case. The books state that Tywin actually doted on Cersei when she was a little girl, and even shared his plans with her in secret. All of this changed as Cersei grew older, however, when Tywin forced her into a loveless marriage to Robert Baratheon to secure a political alliance. Cersei felt betrayed that the father who once included her in his strategies now used her only as a tool, and increasingly blamed it on the secondary status of women in Westeros society. As in the TV series, however, it seems that as Cersei grew older Tywin correctly realized that she simply wasn't very intelligent or skilled at politics, so he eventually stopped wasting the time and effort of trying to train her at all. Similarly to Kevan and Jaime, he came to the conclusion that Cersei was totally incompetent as a mother, and intended to send Tommen to Casterly Rock, to be raised away from her.

His appearance is slightly different in the books, where he is completely bald with long golden "side whiskers" and green eyes flecked with gold.

Tywin's death is also slightly different in the books. When Jaime releases Tyrion from the black cells, he confesses that Tyrion's first wife, Tysha, was not really a whore, and Jaime had not arranged their encounter on the road. Tywin forced Jaime to tell Tyrion that story to teach him a lesson. Ergo, she (presumably) had genuinely loved Tyrion. Enraged by this revelation, Tyrion vows to take revenge on his family. Ignoring Varys's protestations, he climbs a long ladder up to a secret passage in Tywin's chambers, where, as in the TV series, he finds Shae in his father's bed and strangles her. He then confronts his father in the privy. Tywin tries to assure Tyrion that he still intends to send him to the Wall, and is only awaiting Mace Tyrell's approval. The conversation turns to Tysha. Tywin remains belligerent, continually referring to her as a whore. Tyrion warns him not to use the word whore again. When he inquires what became of Tysha, Tywin nonchalantly retorts that she went "wherever whores go." Remembering his father's own lesson that one should never make an empty threat, Tyrion fires the crossbow at him. At the moment of his death, Tywin's bowels loosen, and the stench causes Tyrion to reflect that Lord Tywin Lannister did not in the end "shit gold."

The fact that Shae was found in Tywin's bed is totally out of character for him: Tywin always hated whores - probably as a result of watching his father being dominated by one, and he has been putting Tyrion down nonstop for his whoring. Thus, finding a whore in Tywin's bed can be considered as hypocrisy, but it was not any whore - it was his hateful's son mistress, and whatever his intention was, that makes him much worse than a mere hypocrite.

Tywin's body is found by one of his guards. Cersei is furious when she notices Shae's nude corpse in his bed. Qyburn diplomatically suggests that Lord Tywin may have been "questioning" her. Cersei readily latches onto this explanation, but imagines Tyrion mocking the idea. All present are ordered not to mention that a whore had been found in his bed. Tywin's corpse soon begins to smell horribly, to the point where mourners at his funeral feel physically sick; Tommen dashes out of the sept and vomits. A drying of the mouth also causes Tywin's lips to curl upwards, giving the appearance of a smile. This unnerves Jaime and Cersei, since their father rarely smiled in life.

According to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, "Tywin Lannister" is pronounced "TIE-win LAN-iss-ter", as opposed to "Tih-win", etc.
