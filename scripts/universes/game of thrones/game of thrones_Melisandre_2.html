<html><p>After Melisandre arrives at Castle Black, she oddly continues to wear lightweight clothing not well suited to the sub-arctic cold at the Wall - her magical powers apparently give her all the heat she needs. Her powers also allow her to only sleep for one hour a night: she dislikes sleeping more than the bare minimum she has to, because she has nightmares about her time as a slave. She takes an interest in Jon Snow, and whenever she looks into the flames for visions of Azor Ahai, who she believes to be Stannis, all she sees are visions of Jon.

Melisandre sometimes uses tricks of alchemists and pyromancers and spells of illusion; for instance, she uses an illusion spell to save Mance Rayder from being executed. Some time later she explains to him: "The spell is made of shadow and suggestion. Men see what they expect to see." She also reveals that to Jon, who demands to know what sorcery it is; her answer is "Call it what you will. Glamor, seeming, illusion. Râ€™hllor is Lord of Light, Jon Snow, and it is given to his servants to weave with it, as others weave with thread."

Melisandre does not travel with Stannis's host to Winterfell but stays in Castle Black. She repeatedly warns Jon of "daggers in the dark", but he refuses to listen, especially after she tells him of a vision she has had of Arya fleeing through the North and finding Jon at the Wall; the girl turns out to be Alys Karstark.

Melisandre is one of the people whom Ramsay demands from Jon in the Pink Letter, referring to her as "his [Stannis's] red witch." It is unclear why Ramsay (if indeed the letter was written by him) needs her.

Despite what Davos thinks of Melisandre, she is not heartless: she sympathizes with him for losing four of his sons at the battle of the Blackwater; therefore she asks Stannis to leave Davos's fifth son Devan at Castle Black, where he will be relatively safe. Melisandre does not resent Davos for intending to kill her or for preventing her from sacrificing Edric Storm. She has a positive opinion about Davos due to his total loyalty to Stannis, even though he is misguided in her eyes.

Her appearance is slightly different in the books. She is described as having red eyes and being taller than most men. Carice van Houten, who plays Melisandre, has blue eyes and is not particularly tall, her height being 5 foot 6.5 inches (169 cm). Melisandre's hair is noted to be much redder than that of a natural redhead, but this was easily addressed with a wig.

Melisandre's name did not appear in the Season 1 pronunciation guide, but the phonetic pronunciation of her name was later seen written out in a behind-the-scenes short video: "meh-liss-AHN-dreh."
