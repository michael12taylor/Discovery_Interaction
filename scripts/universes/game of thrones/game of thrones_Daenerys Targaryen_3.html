<html><p>Daenerys and Jon come upon the two dragons in a bone pit outside Winterfell's walls. She mounts Drogon, planning to take him for a ride, and suggests that Jon mount Rhaegal. After much trepidation, Jon does so, and the dragons take the pair on a wild ride over the snow-covered landscape, Daenerys being somewhat pleased with Jon's almost instant connection with her dragon. Eventually, they land near a waterfall in an area where Jon used to hunt as a youth. Away from all concerns about the coming battle, Daenerys and Jon share an intimate moment.

Daenerys's meeting with Sam goes sour.
Daenerys and Jorah later encounter Samwell Tarly in Winterfell's library. After praising him for realizing the secret behind dragonglass and curing Jorah of his greyscale, she asks if there is anything she can do to repay him. Sam jokingly asks for a pardon for stealing books from the Citadel and for taking his family's ancestral sword without permission. Upon hearing his surname is "Tarly", Daenerys realizes that he is, in fact, Randyll Tarly's son, and proceeds to tell him the difficult truth that she executed his father and brother for rebelling against her. Sam is speechless for a few moments before asking to leave the library.

Daenerys puts Jaime on trial.
When Jaime arrives at Winterfell, Daenerys is once again seated at the high table with Jon and Sansa. The two women harshly berate the Kingslayer for his past actions and question whether his loyalty to their cause is genuine. Only when Brienne vouches for Jaime does Sansa trust him, and Daenerys allows his sword to be returned to him.

Daenerys and Sansa discuss Jon.
Later, Daenerys speaks privately with Sansa, addressing some of the thorny political issues involved in their alliance. Sansa is afraid Daenerys has ulterior motives and that because Jon loves her, he will do stupid things for love. Daenerys assures Sansa this is not the case and confesses her love for Jon, explaining she has had only one goal - retaking the Iron Throne - until she met Jon and now she's in the North helping him fight the Night King and the army of the dead. Although a greater understanding appears to develop between the two women, Sansa remains firm in her conviction that the Northerners will never truly accept an outsider as their ruler again, and bluntly asks Daenerys what her plans for the North are once the dead have been defeated. The awkward moment is interrupted by Maester Wolkan announcing the arrival of Theon and his men.

Daenerys attends a war council.
When the survivors from Eastwatch bring the news that the army of the dead will be at Winterfell's gates within a day, preparations inside the castle begin to move forward at a feverish pace. Daenerys meets with all the prominent commanders and heads of houses to discuss battle strategy, and later finds herself in the crypts with Jon. While standing in front of Lyanna Stark's statue, Daenerys recounts how everybody told her Rhaegar was decent and kind but that he kidnapped and raped Lyanna. However, Jon reveals Rhaegar did not rape Lyanna and they were in love. He tells Daenerys the truth about his parentage and she is stunned. She immediately questions the validity of the story. When Jon assures her that it's true, she realizes that Jon actually has a better claim to the throne than she does. Before either can discuss the matter further, a horn sounds three times to signal the arrival of the army of the dead.

Jon and Daenerys watch as the battle at Winterfell begins.
Daenerys and Jon watch with Drogon and Rhaegal from a distance as the Dothraki charge the army of the dead, but when the Dothraki are slaughtered, Daenerys breaks away from Jon's plan to wait for the Night King and attacks the army of the dead with dragonfire. Daenerys and Jon's visibility is cut off when the White Walkers summon a blizzard, however. High in the skies above Winterfell, Daenerys and Drogon are suddenly attacked by the Night King on Viserion, but she is able to evade him. Daenerys and Drogon later knock the Night King off Viserion, and Daenerys has Drogon burn the Night King, though to no avail.

Daenerys cries over Jorah's body.
They escape as the Night King hurls an ice spear at Drogon. When Jon is surrounded by newly risen wights, Daenerys saves him with Drogon, burning through wights and creating a path for Jon to rush into Winterfell to help Bran and stop the Night King. She urges Jon to go and after he runs to stop the Night King, wights climb onto Drogon, and Daenerys falls off while Drogon flies away. Daenerys takes hold of a discarded sword and slays a few wights who come her way or Jorah's. However, she is also protected by Jorah, who dies defending her, leaving Daenerys sobbing while Drogon wraps around them after the Army of the Dead falls.

Daenerys celebrates Winterfell's victory.
After the battle, which saw a living victory, Daenerys mourns the dead outside Winterfell, lighting a pyre. She kisses the dead Jorah's forehead and whispers something to him. Daenerys later celebrates at the feast inside Winterfell. Tormund makes a toast to Daenerys, "To the Dragon Queen!" and Daenerys stands up herself, toasting Arya Stark as the "Hero of Winterfell." However, despite her initially celebratory mood and the smiles she exchanges with Jon, Daenerys's mood grows downcast when Tormund begins to praise Jon and she finds herself lonely and envious over Jon's popularity with the wildlings, looking around at the groups of people around her.

Daenerys finds Jon in his chambers that night and they kiss, beginning to undress, before Jon stops himself due to learning of their relation. Daenerys laments that she wishes Jon never told her about his true identity because otherwise, she'd be happy. She is afraid others will press his claim and take the throne from her. Jon tries to assure her he doesn't want the throne.

Daenerys begs for Jon's secrecy.
Daenerys tells Jon it doesn't matter what he wants or how many times he swears fealty to her - he didn't want to be King in the North either. Jon gets on one knee before her and says that he'll refuse the crown because she is his queen. Daenerys begs Jon not to tell anyone else about his parentage, fearing that it will destroy them. Jon insists he must tell his sisters because he owes them the truth about who he is, certain his sisters will keep it secret, everything will work out, and they can all live together. However, Daenerys believes the only way they can live together is if Jon keeps his identity secret.

In her anger, Daenerys attempts to avenge Rhaegal's death by killing Euron.
Daenerys leads a war council for her resumed campaign against Cersei Lannister for the Iron Throne. As her fleet is sailing back to Dragonstone, she rides Drogon next to Rhaegal, when suddenly Rhaegal is shot by three bolts before plummeting into Blackwater Bay. Euron's Iron Fleet reveals itself from behind Dragonstone's rocks and tries to take down Daenerys and Drogon, but are unable to do as they pull back. Euron instead targets Daenerys's fleet, destroying it and capturing Missandei in the process. On Dragonstone, Daenerys becomes tempted to storm King's Landing. Daenerys, Tyrion, Varys, and Grey Worm parley with Cersei outside the gates of King's Landing, where Cersei executes Missandei in front of them.

A mournful Daenerys discovers treason in her ranks.
Back at Dragonstone, a mourning Daenerys refuses to eat and becomes increasingly angered at the rule of House Lannister, as well as becoming increasingly paranoid that her claim to the throne is losing legitimacy. However, her fears are found to be true when she learns through Tyrion that Varys has plotted to betray her and crown Jon in her place, after learning the truth of his parentage from Sansa. Daenerys has Varys brought out onto the shores of Dragonstone, where she sentences him to die by having Drogon burn him, just as she promised him earlier if he were ever to betray her.

Daenerys confronts Jon on his claim.
Later, when Daenerys and Jon talk, she reminds him of her warning to him about telling Sansa the truth of who he was. Daenerys says Sansa is as responsible for Varys's death as she is. Jon attempts to reassure Daenerys that he doesn't want the crown (having also told Varys he wouldn't take it). Daenerys laments that Jon has the love of the people while she does not - she only has fear. In an effort to compensate, Jon tells Daenerys he loves her and that she'll always be his queen. Daenerys kisses him and Jon gives into the kiss, but breaks it off due to their blood ties. Daenerys accepts this and resigns herself to being feared.

Tyrion consults with Daenerys, the latter of whom is now ordering Grey Worm and the Unsullied to sack King's Landing. Tyrion is strongly against it, saying that the citizens of the city are not Daenerys's enemy and are innocent. Daenerys counters that the slaves in Meereen turned against their masters and liberated themselves. Tyrion responds that the smallfolk are afraid of Cersei because Cersei will punish any rebellious acts. Daenerys says they are hostages in a tyrant's grip, and Tyrion begs her not to burn the city, or thousands of children will die. Daenerys counters that Cersei is using mercy as a weakness against them but Cersei is wrong, mercy is their strength - her mercy for the future generations of Westeros, not those in the present. In a last-ditch effort to get through to Daenerys, Tyrion bargains one last time: wait for the city to surrender and call off the attack when the people ring the city's bells, indicating the full, unconditional surrender of Cersei and her army. Reluctantly, Daenerys agrees. Before Tyrion leaves, she informs her Hand that Jaime was caught by her men trying to get past their lines. She warns him that the next time he fails her, it will be his very last.

Daenerys attacks Euron's Iron Fleet atop Drogon as the Battle of King's Landing begins, sinking the fleet and destroying the scorpions. Daenerys then attacks the scorpions stationed across the walls of King's Landing, destroying them all, preventing the Lannister soldiers from targeting Drogon.

Having lost so much, Daenerys succumbs to the Targaryen madness.
Daenerys destroys the gate and its walls that the Golden Company guards, killing many of the sellswords from the debris that falls upon them. This allows the Dothraki, Unsullied, the Northern and the Vale armies to destroy the remaining sellsword contingent and charge into the city. Overwhelmed, the Lannister soldiers and civilians surrender, ringing the city's bells. However, Daenerys, consumed by grief and anger, instead goes on a rampage, using Drogon to burn King's Landing. The dragonfire also sets off the wildfire caches placed around the city by her father, the Mad King, years ago, leaving the city in ashes. At the same time, her armies, taking their lead from Daenerys, proceed to run riot through the city, killing any Lannister soldiers and civilians they can get their hands on.

Daenerys is hailed by her armies in a ruined King's Landing.
Thousands of the surrendered soldiers and innocent civilians are killed in the firestorm across the city, either from Drogon, Daenerys's soldiers, or collapsing buildings and debris. After the battle, Daenerys orders the captured Lannister soldiers to be executed. 

Daenerys, consumed by anger, orders Tyrion's arrest.
Daenerys later stands over the carnage and ashes of King's Landing, as she is cheered on by the Dothraki and guarded by the Unsullied. She delivers a speech to her victorious armies, proclaiming that they gave her the Seven Kingdoms and "liberated" the people of King's Landing but declares their war is not over. She will continue to "liberate" the rest of the world as they did for King's Landing, and will "break the wheel" to free it from those whom she perceives as tyrants. Tyrion approaches Daenerys, who confronts him about freeing his brother. She becomes angry after he retorts that she slaughtered a city, and tosses away his Hand of the Queen pin. In return, Daenerys has him arrested. Jon visits an imprisoned Tyrion, who tries to convince a conflicted Jon on what Daenerys has become. He understands Jon loves her, he loves her too, and knows he is asking Jon to do a terrible thing, but it is also the right thing. Tyrion then stresses that Daenerys is now the greatest threat to the people.

Daenerys finally observes the Iron Throne.
Walking through the charred remains of the throne room, seeing what she saw in her vision in the House of the Undying years ago, with the Iron Throne the only piece completely intact, Daenerys ascends in awe and reaches her hand out to touch one of the snow-covered blades. Before she can sit down, Jon enters and she recounts to him the conquest of her ancestor Aegon and how he had the Iron Throne built. Jon confronts her about the many atrocities she committed during the battle; however, she justifies her actions and, despite Jon's pleas for her do so, she refuses to forgive Tyrion and the people of King's Landing. He begs Daenerys to make the people see that they made a mistake, and to make them understand.

Daenerys attempts to convince Jon of her vision for the world.
Unswayed by Jon's reasoning, Daenerys asserts that they can't hide behind small mercies and the world they need cannot be built by those loyal to the old one. Jon desperately argues that their world must be one of mercy; Daenerys assures him that she is building a good world. Distressed, Jon asks her how she knows it's good and Daenerys confidently asserts that she knows what is good, trying to convince Jon that he does too. Upset, Jon is unconvinced and asks about everybody else who thinks they know what is good, to which Daenerys responds, "They don't get to choose." Daenerys embraces Jon and makes clear her desire for Jon to help her build the new world she envisages and urges him that this is how they break the wheel.

Dany dies in Jon's arms.
Jon tells Daenerys that she is his queen, "Now and always." As the two of them share a final kiss, Jon thrusts a dagger into her heart. He catches Daenerys as she falls, blood escaping her nose and mouth, a look of confused heartbreak draws upon her face. As an anguished Jon holds Daenerys, he grieves over her.

Drogon mourns his "mother."
Drogon notices Jon laying Daenerys down on the ground and approaches them. Drawing closer, he snarls at Jon before trying to nudge his mother awake. Upon realizing that she is dead, Drogon, roars in rage and grief at Jon before unleashing a jet of fire that melts the Iron Throne. He then carries off Daenerys's body with his claws, flying far off into the distance, never to be seen again.

With House Targaryen legally extinct, the Great Council of 305 AC decide that the Seven Kingdoms will be an elective monarchy under Brandon I. Through this elective monarchy, Tyrion fulfills Daenerys's wish of "breaking the wheel", while Jon is exiled to the Night's Watch in order to avoid a war between the Unsullied and his supporters.

Abilities

Dragonriding - Daenerys is a capable dragonrider who uses Drogon as her mount.
Personality
Daenerys was polite and well-spoken, but filled with quiet determination. As a child and young woman she was easily cowed by her brother's ambitions and occasional cruel rages. She was also somewhat naive of the world at that point, due to being young and living her life as an exile (with only her petulant brother to rely on for knowledge), but her time amongst the Dothraki taught her pride, confidence, and the skills of command. At the same time, her own intelligence began to manifest, and she was quick to understand that she was now free to pursue her own path.

Daenerys spent her entire early life living on the sufferance of others, bouncing back and forth between benefactors (like Illyrio Mopatis) with her brother, until whatever dreams those benefactors had of supporting the siblings' claim to the Iron Throne wore off, and they were forced to move on to another patron. As a result, Daenerys never knew a true home, and constantly living under her brother's domination gave her great empathy with the downtrodden of the world: she was deeply sympathetic to those she perceived as oppressed, while at the same time, her pent-up frustration from years of being dominated by her petty would-be-king of a brother made Daenerys capable of utter ruthlessness against those she perceived as oppressing others. This experience caused Daenerys to develop a largely black-and-white worldview, and she could be idealistic to a fault: upon seeing the plight of the slaves in Slaver's Bay, Daenerys became determined to free all the slaves in the region, with little thought devoted to the practical after-effects which would result from such an action and without thinking that between some slaves and their masters could exist respect or even love. A particular example of this is when the Great Masters of Meereen crucified 163 children as she approached the city in an attempt to intimidate her. After she took the city, instead of pardoning the slave-masters, she had 163 of them crucified in retribution, including many who opposed the crucifixion of the children, unconcerned about any negative political fallout which would result.

Other examples of Daenerys's naivety and narrow-mindedness were when Tyrion asked her how she intended to take the Iron Throne, and Daenerys answered that she would simply earn the common people's favor. This demonstrated both her lack of understanding of the real power wielded by the noble houses, and that she didn't have a clear vision of the political situation in Westeros; in Slaver's Bay, she earned the favor of the commoners by abolishing slavery, but in Westeros there were no slaves to free or similarly oppressed people to help. The invasion she ended up launching against Cersei made Daenerys, in the citizens' eyes, a conqueror rather than a liberator. She caused further suffering to those who had already lost so much during the previous war and, in the eyes of Northmen, she was the one who came to deny them the independence they had gained after so many sacrifices. While such an outcome would almost certainly have happened, the fact that Daenerys was genuinely surprised at the lack of accommodation to her rule proves even more the idealistic vision she had of Westeros.

Her keeping to consider Westeros her home, while she was just born there, and her disappointment for the Westerosis' lack of recognition, while Ser Jorah himself told her from the beginning that the smallfolk don't care who their ruler is as long their lives are free from starvation, illness, and war, showed another aspect that made her fell prey of her naivety: her stubbornness. Even before departing from Essos her advisors, directly or not, warned her that coming to Westeros wouldn't have made her a liberator. Then her reaction showed how much she refused to accept the reality: she didn't have peaceful ways to be recognized as the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms, but her determination prevented her from questioning herself and her position before it was too late to find a solution. 

About her family's fame, particularly after her brother's death, Daenerys has always shown a dual and, in some cases, opportunistic if not even hypocritical consideration: Daenerys has always remarked how much different she was from her father, who she was not afraid to call evil to reassure others about the goodness of her intentions, just as both she and her supporters have always remarked that she became queen through her own strength and that they follow her by choice; however, Daenerys kept using her status as the Mad King's daughter as a right to aspire to the Iron Throne, as well as, during her first meeting with the then King in the North, Jon Snow, in the face of the latter's reluctance to bow to her, Daenerys, who a minute earlier had asked him to not judge her on the basis of her father's actions, tried to intimidate him by accusing Jon's (supposed) father, Ned Stark, of conspiring with Robert Baratheon in his attempt to kill her. And even after accepting that her father was maybe the worst ruler in history, she kept considering Jaime Lannister only a traitor. This leaves a big question about how much she cared about her father, if she truly loved him or if she considered him only a tool for reconquer the Iron Throne.

Daenerys showed herself to be quite vengeful on several occasions, mainly to individuals who had caused her significant grievances. When Mirri Maz Duur tricked her into allowing the use blood magic to "save" Drogo, Daenerys had the witch bound and burnt alive. Upon learning the role that Xaro and Doreah played in the theft of her dragons (and the deaths of her servants), she had them both locked in an empty vault. She had Randyll and Dickon Tarly burned alive for refusing to bend the knee after she defeated them in battle, which may have further soured her reputation in Westeros along with Cersei's anti-Daenerys propaganda. In the last case, however, it is worth noting that she executed them only after offering them the choice of surrender, which they declined. Tyrion also seemed to believe that her execution of the Tarlys was more the result of losing her temper, rather than any deliberate ruthlessness. Also, her refusal of listening to Tyrion in that moment could be caused also by both her anger against his military failure and by Olenna Tyrell's advice about learning to take decisions by herself.

Despite her perceived confidence and ruthlessness, Daenerys has displayed surprisingly tender emotion and at times can appear quite vulnerable, at least in private. Her fondness for children has been shown multiple times, and when Drogon incinerated the young daughter of a shepherd in Meereen, she was visibly disturbed, which led to her locking Rhaegal and Viserion in the catacombs to prevent further atrocities. When attempting to quell the opposition to her rule in Meereen, she finds herself at a loss and desperately asks Missandei for her input, not trying to hide her frazzled state. After rescuing Jon and company from a wight attack - and losing Viserion in the process - she doesn't try to hide her tears. In the same interaction, when Jon declares his loyalty to her and says that the other Northern lords will come to see her as he does, she says in a rather small voice "I hope I deserve it", showing a sense of doubt that had rarely been displayed before.

It is debatable whether Daenerys was a highly skilled battle commander. She did win some impressive victories, especially her swift conquest of Slaver's Bay and the Siege of Meereen, but each time she had a vast (and unexpected) advantage in numbers, as well as the support of her three dragons. Thus, her victories had more to do with overwhelming the enemy than brilliant tactical leadership. On the other hand, knowing that she was inexperienced in the art of warfare, Daenerys took care to surround herself with experienced and capable warriors who could advise her and help coordinate her battles. She also had a clear sense of strategy, if not specific tactics; she knew how to win battles in such a way to leave herself in the strongest position possible, and avoided engagements that would result in heavy casualties, in order to conserve and protect the troops at her disposal. Daenerys certainly knew how to put her dragons to decisive effect in battle; her use of Drogon at the Sack of Astapor and the Battle of the Goldroad ended both battles almost before they started.

After losing Rhaegal in her first battle against the Iron Fleet, Daenerys became enraged and would have incinerated the fleet then-and-there, but realized that a head-on attack would be putting her remaining dragon, Drogon, in great danger. In her next encounter with the Iron Fleet, she had the insight to change her approach, managing to destroy the fleet with apparently little effort and ensure Drogon's survival. She also managed to skillfully eliminate all the scorpions perched on the battlements of King's Landing and secure the surrender of its inhabitants with what seemed like a minimal death toll.

Therefore, in her life before her descent into madness, Daenerys showed herself to be a strong and determined woman, sometimes a little too emotional, rash and idealistic, but also benevolent, decent and able to understand her mistakes and learn from them. Unfortunately, this, along with the traumas she suffered and her obsession with regaining the rule of the Seven Kingdoms, led her to be also too fragile to bear the burden of her moral defeat: despite having proved to be, both as a person and as a ruler, much better than her enemies, finding out how this was not enough to be appreciated by the other inhabitants of the Seven Kingdoms pushed her over the edge, making her the tyrant she had always sworn never to become.

Targaryen madness
Initially, Daenerys did not exhibit the "Targaryen madness" that plagued many of her ancestors, including her father and, to a lesser extent, her brother Viserys. Like most Targaryens, she could be ruthless to her perceived enemies, but while Viserys was cruel and demanding to his servants and even his benefactors, Daenerys reciprocated the loyalty of those who followed her with gratitude and compassion, especially towards her inner circle of friends and her dragons. On the other hand, insanity was often a late-onset condition in the Targaryens, and it didn't always manifest in obvious ways: One could argue that certain of Daenerys's actions, such as her crucifixion of 163 slave masters in Meereen and her burning the men of House Tarly with dragonfire, were telltale signs of Targaryen madness, but even these are not as simple as they appear: In the former case, she felt she was avenging the deaths of 163 innocent slave children that the masters had crucified in order to intimidate her, thus there was a well-intentioned, if brutal, motive behind the act. In the latter case, the men of House Tarly were in open rebellion against her and had refused her offer of bending the knee, thus making the distinction different from inflicting punishment for its own sake.

In Daenerys's case, whatever traces of the Targaryen madness she had within her were also heavily exacerbated by a series of unexpected external factors. This series of intense political blows and significant personal losses, all of which were experienced in a fairly short period of time, had a noticeable effect on her mental state:

After Jon Snow told her about his true parentage, Daenerys realized he had the better claim to the Iron Throne and she began to display increasing paranoia about her legitimacy, despite the fact that Jon had renounced his claim and vowed to support her.
Towards the end of the Battle of Ice and Fire, an already devastated Daenerys witnessed the death of her most devoted follower, closest advisor, and longtime friend Ser Jorah Mormont.
After the battle was won and matters turned once again to ousting Cersei, Daenerys feared that if word of Jon's parentage spread, others would press his claim to the throne over hers, regardless of Jon's unwillingness to take it.
She told Jon that he must never tell anybody the truth about himself, but Jon felt he owed the truth to his sisters Sansa and Arya. Having already faced a cold reception from Sansa regarding her unwillingness to accept Northern independence, Daenerys believed that Sansa would conspire to see Jon on the Iron Throne over herself. While Jon was certain Sansa would keep the truth secret, Daenerys warned him the truth would lead to disaster. Additionally, Jon's halting their physical intimacy upon finding out about their blood relation could also have contributed to Daenerys's mental degradation.

While Jon was certain Sansa would keep the truth secret, Daenerys warned him the truth would lead to disaster. Additionally, Jon's halting their physical intimacy upon finding out about their blood relation could also have contributed to Daenerys's mental degradation.
When Daenerys later arrived at Dragonstone to prepare for her invasion of King's Landing, her second dragon, Rhaegal, was shot down by Euron Greyjoy and his fleet. Her beloved companion Missandei was also captured by Euron during his ambush, and subsequently executed by the Mountain on Cersei's orders, while Daenerys watched from afar during a failed parley. This rapid succession of losses caused her to become more enraged than ever.
Her sense of paranoia increased when she discovered that Jon had told Sansa and Arya about his parentage - and despite Jon swearing Sansa and Arya to secrecy, Sansa had told Tyrion. Tyrion subsequently told Varys, and Varys later attempted to poison Daenerys out of fear that she was becoming more and more like her father. While Daenerys fulfilled her previous promise to Varys that she would burn him alive if he ever conspired against her, the end result was that most members of her inner circle were now dead.
Finally, she felt she could also no longer fully trust Tyrion due to his poor military strategy, conflict of interest regarding his desire to spare his family, actions that unintentionally led to Varys scheming to overthrow her, and slow effort to warn her about what were - in her eyes - predictable dangers to her mission.
During the Battle of King's Landing, Daenerys finally snapped - burning the inhabitants alive even though the city had surrendered to her - and by all appearances seemed to have gone mad. However, this may not have been the actual "Targeryen madness" that prompted her father to attempt a similar action: It is equally possible that her actions were motivated or even triggered by the extreme anger and grief over her recent losses, most of which were caused in some way by the Lannisters. Also, it should be noted that the Targaryen Madness, historically, does not always equate to "insanity" as we might understand it. In fact, of all the Targaryens who ruled as kings, the only one who could truly be called "insane" in the contemporary sense was Aerys II; Daenerys's father heard voices in his head and lost all touch with reality. Daenerys displayed no such symptoms, and after her destructive rampage, she seemed perfectly lucid when speaking to Jon in the ruins of the Red Keep. Madness takes many forms, including true psychopathy, which seems to have emerged in Daenerys. Though her actions may be justifiable, that does not make them right, or proof of a sound mind. Her ancestor Maegor, it could be argued, was justified in taking a similarly harsh hand in dealing with the rebellious Faith Militant, but his cruelty was objectively excessive and, as his successor, Jaehaerys I, proved, not the only solution to the problem.

Daenerys's extreme actions could also have been triggered by the destruction of her dreams: While she had accepted the stories of her father's madness were true, she sincerely believed it was her destiny to become Queen of the Seven Kingdoms by virtue of her birthright. Her many accomplishments in Essos, including her dragons' birth, her liberation of slaves, and her persuading the Dothraki to follow her across the sea, only furthered this vision of a grand destiny in her mind. As Tryion had previously warned her, however, neither her accomplishments nor her birthright were guaranteed to secure support in Westeros, either from the common people or the noble houses. After discovering that Jon was the true heir to the Iron Throne, and that people in Westeros viewed her not as a liberator but as an invader, she realized that her dreams were truly empty. This would have been a great blow to her psyche, and unable to accept a future in which she wouldn't sit on the Iron Throne, she decided that she had to take it by force.

The sight of the Red Keep and the sound of its tolling bell triggered something in Daenerys and finally caused her to snap. She seemingly showed no mercy as thousands of innocent people died in dragonfire, and shocked her allies with the devastation she wrought. Daenerys appeared to turn into a worse tyrant than those she set out to eliminate, posing an ethical dilemma for her former lover and prime claimant to the Iron Throne, Jon Snow, whom Daenerys hoped would join her in ruling her new world. After discussing the recent turn of events and the dramatic shift in Daenerys's personality with an incarcerated Tyrion, Jon made the fateful decision to end her reign before it began; for the good of the realm and its people - the same values that the Night's Watch and his own experiences had long instilled in him - Jon tearfully plunged his dagger into Daenerys's heart. Whether she truly succumbed to the Targaryen Madness or not, in the end she became like her father, the one thing she did not want to be, and tragically suffered the same fate as him; stabbed to death by one she thought truly loyal to her.

Relationships
Khal Drogo: the most powerful Dothraki khal of his time and Daenerys's first husband, to whom she was betrothed by Viserys and Illyrio Mopatis in order to secure Drogo's Dothraki army in their campaign to retake the Iron Throne from Robert Baratheon. At first, Daenerys was intimidated by Drogo, but came to love him after learning he was a smart leader and kind man. Drogo himself grew to love and respect Daenerys as his khaleesi, which led to them conceiving a child, Rhaego. However, after sacking a village, Drogo was infected in a fight with a rebellious blood-rider and the wound festered, and he was ultimately rendered catatonic by the blood magic by Mirri Maz Duur, which also claimed Rhaego's life. Daenerys smothered Drogo out of pity and cremated him on a funeral pyre.
Daario Naharis: a lieutenant in the Second Sons sellsword company who became smitten with Daenerys and killed his superiors when they advocated assassinating Daenerys for the Masters of Yunkai. Daenerys eventually developed a sexual relationship with Daario which grew into genuine love, on his part. She ultimately ended their relationship on Tyrion Lannister's advice so she could pursue political alliances through marriage just before leaving for Westeros, and they parted ways on good terms.
Ser Jorah Mormont: an exiled knight from Westeros who has long loved Daenerys but until recently found his feelings for her largely unrequited, especially after she learned he was initially spying on her, for which she banished him. However, upon seeing the lengths he went to rescue her, even after contracting greyscale, she orders him to find a cure for himself so that he can be by her side in the event that she takes back the Seven Kingdoms. After being successfully cured by Samwell Tarly in the Citadel, Jorah returns to Daenerys's service. Although they are both aware of Jorah's feelings for her, he seems content to remain her servitor and not her lover.
Jon Snow: the alleged bastard son of Ned Stark, but in reality, the hidden son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, making him Daenerys's nephew by blood. They later fall in love and become lovers. Neither Daenerys nor Jon are aware of their blood relationship or Jon's true origins at first. Having been summoned from Winterfell to bend the knee to Daenerys, Jon refuses on the grounds that he doesn't know her, his people won't accept a southern ruler, and it's more important to ally against the Night King and the army of the dead than to remove Cersei from the Iron Throne. Though Jon and Daenerys are initially wary and distrustful of one another, they begin to warm to each other. Upon realizing that the threat of the Night King may be real after all, Daenerys becomes more open to Jon; over the course of their time together, feelings begin to develop between them.
After Viserion is killed by the Night King in a skirmish beyond the Wall,, Daenerys vows to destroy the Night King alongside Jon, who, upon seeing Daenerys's strength of character and devotion, bends the knee and pledges himself to her as his Queen. Jon and Daenerys give in to their feelings and consummate their relationship while on the ship sailing North, and they fall in love. Meanwhile, Bran reveals to Samwell that Jon is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, after which Samwell tells Bran that he discovered Rhaegar had his marriage to Elia Martell annulled before marrying Lyanna. Bran goes into the past and learns from a vision that Jon is the true-born son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, and thus the true heir to the Iron Throne ahead of Daenerys.
This revelation affects Jon and Daenerys's newfound alliance and personal relationship in crucial ways and has far-reaching implications for the realm. At this point, a coin toss seems to separate them from being brought closer together and continuing their romantic relationship, forging a powerful alliance possibly by marriage* - as Targaryens have done in the past - or being driven apart due to their cultural and psychological differences - owing to their very different upbringings and personal experiences.
Prior to them both finding out about their kinship, Daenerys confides with Sansa that she loves Jon, and that she deferred her life long quest for the Iron Throne - to help fight the Night King and the Army of the Dead which was threatening humanity - because of this love.
At Winterfell, whilst celebrating the victory of the living over the dead, Daenerys visits Jon in his chamber, whereupon he consoles her about Ser Jorah's death, saying if he could have chosen a way to die, it would have been protecting her. Daenerys reveals the true depth of her affections for Jon when she says that Jorah loved her, but she could not love him the same way, the way she loves Jon. Jon begins to kiss her and the couple engages, beginning to remove each other's clothes but Jon hesitates and pulls back. At this point, Daenerys says she wishes he'd never told her; that she would be much happier not knowing. Though Jon renounces his claim in favor of her own, Daenerys's observation of the love the wildlings have for Jon makes her doubt Westeros will ever have that kind of love for her.
It is at that point that Daenerys first expresses her feelings towards Jon as a threat to her claim to the throne. She worries what will happen if people were to find out and demand that he presses his claim. While Jon insists he'll refuse and that she's his queen, she points out that it doesn't matter if he wants the Iron Throne - he didn't want to be King in the North, but it was still expected of him. Her solution is for Jon to say nothing to anyone about his parentage, and to swear Samwell and Bran to secrecy. She fears the truth will take on a life of its own and he won't be able to control it or what it does to people, which turns out to be true. Daenerys wishes that things could go back to the way they were, before they both knew of his true parentage; she fears what Sansa will do if she finds out.
Jon's divided loyalties become apparent at this point: he feels Sansa and Arya - two of the people he grew up with and loves as his siblings - deserve to know the truth about himself. When Daenerys asks, "Even if the truth destroys us?" Jon is certain this won't happen and his sisters will keep it secret while Daenerys seems certain it will lead to disaster. She tells him she has never begged for anything before, and proceeds to beg him not to tell them the truth. When Jon is certain he, Daenerys, and his siblings can all live together with the truth, Daenerys believes that is only possible if Jon remains silent.

At Dragonstone, Daenerys raises her concern about the love the people of Westeros have for him, whereas she has only their fear. In an effort to compensate, Jon tells Daenerys that he loves her and that she will always be his queen. She asks him if that is all she is to him - his queen, implying that she wants more from him than a lord to swear fealty to her; she wants him as her lover. (As noted above, she had previously confided to Sansa the importance of her love for him, and that she loves Jon in the same way Jorah loved her). Daenerys tries to re-engage their relationship but, though he gives in at first, Jon again disengages from their physical intimacy; their relationship is visibly strained due to his unease surrounding their close blood relation*. Daenerys resigns herself to letting the fear she has inspired in Westeros be her ruling principle.
Following the destruction of King's Landing, Jon confronts Daenerys about the genocide she perpetrated. They have fundamental disagreements about the way to go about building the new world: Daenerys believes mercy is now a weakness to be reserved for a new world whereas Jon pleads with Daenerys that forgiveness and mercy are what is required now. Daenerys is unwavering. They disagree on what is good: Daenerys is certain that her way is the only way to bring about a good world and that she knows what is good, telling Jon that he does as well; others don't get to choose. Jon sees her authoritarianism as immovable. Full of hope, she tells a distressed Jon she wants him with her to rule this new world she plans to create. They share a kiss before he reluctantly plunges a dagger into her heart. Stunned, Daenerys dies in a devastated Jon's arms, thus bringing their relationship to its tragic conclusion.
Titles
Daenerys is the second member of the Targaryen dynasty to bear her name. The first Daenerys was the sister of King Daeron II, who lived a century before Daenerys Stormborn. The earlier Daenerys wed into House Martell as part of the marriage-alliance, earning her the moniker "Daenerys of Sunspear", which at last united Dorne with the rest of the realm. Since Daenerys of Sunspear did not rule as a queen regnant, Daenerys Stormborn is not called "Daenerys II." When Daenerys Stormborn proclaims herself the rightful heir of the Targaryen dynasty, she is styled officially as "Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name" (Xaro is the first to address her by that title). Daenerys is quite fond of her "Stormborn" sobriquet, however, and frequently substitutes it for "First of Her Name."

According to Missandei, Daenerys's full title is "Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains." She formerly used the full title of "Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men" alongside her past title of Queen of Meereen.

While she is technically only a claimant to the Iron Throne, she has been acknowledged as queen by Dorne, House Tyrell (now extinct), Jon Snow, and a faction of the divided House Greyjoy.
She ruled Meereen in her own right, the right of conquest. Technically, she ruled the entirety of Slaver's Bay, but her main base of operations in Essos was Meereen. She gave up her claim to Meereen in order to pursue her birthright, ruling the Seven Kingdoms; however, she retains authority over Meereen through Daario and the Second Sons, at least until the people are ready to choose their new leaders.
Daenerys continues to claim the title of khaleesi as a matter of personal pride, even though she is violating Dothraki tradition by acting in her own interests and not recusing herself to Vaes Dothrak; the territorial designation "of the Great Grass Sea" might be her own invention or a borrowed address of respect from one of the Free Cities. Although she never claimed to be the sole khaleesi, following her killing the khals and uniting nearly all the Dothraki under her leadership, she has few challengers to the title.
The remainder of her titles refer to her personal actions:  She took the title Breaker of Chains after the Sack of Astapor. She calls herself "the Unburnt" due to her miraculous survival of Drogo's funeral pyre, and the conflagrations at the House of the Undying and the temple of the dosh khaleen. It was that same pyre that, of course, gave Daenerys her most impressive title, "Mother of Dragons."
Daenerys is increasingly referred to as the "Dragon Queen" as her exploits become more famous and the dragons grow, but this is a matter of common parlance and not a title she uses herself.

Behind the scenes
Kinga Gavalda was a stunt double for Emilia Clarke in the role of Daenerys Targaryen.

Casting
The role of Daenerys was originally played by Tamzin Merchant in the unaired pilot episode, but the role was recast for the actual series for undisclosed reasons. Elizabeth Olsen auditioned for the role, but her audition went poorly.

Costuming
Costume Designer Michele Clapton explained the costuming shifts that Daenerys goes through in Seasons 1 to 3. In Season 1, it is obviously a major shift when Daenerys starts to wear Dothraki clothing, showing that she is willing to immerse herself in their culture in a way Viserys never will, and earns reciprocal respect from them as a result. However, as Season 1 progresses, Daenerys later switches to a different outfit - still in Dothraki fashion, but made of tanned crocodile hide. The Dothraki also wear animal skins but use horse-leather. Daenerys put her own Targaryen-themed twist on this by still using leather made from an animal, but from a reptile to evoke her ties to the ancient dragons. In Season 2, Daenerys switches to a Qartheen gown that Xaro provides her, yet she switches into different variants in a subtle progression throughout the season. Initially, Daenerys was awed by Xaro's generosity and Qarth's elegance, but almost at the risk of losing herself: as she increasingly starts to doubt Xaro and become dissatisfied with Qarth in general (as it becomes more apparent that none of them will give her the army she needs), she starts incorporating more and more "Dothraki-style" features back into her outfit. Instead of the completely Qarth-style gown she wore in "Garden of Bones", she starts adding more metal armored pieces or leather, similar to her earlier Dothraki costume.

In Season 3, by the time that Daenerys's ship arrives in Slaver's Bay she has shifted into a new outfit which she retains for most of the rest of the season (alternating with others such as her white gown). In the Season 3 Blu-ray, Clapton explained why Daenerys wears a bright blue dress instead of, say, the traditional Targaryen colors of red and black (which Viserys wore): blue was the color of royalty in Khal Drogo's khalasar. It was the color of the expensive dye that they adorned themselves with, more so on special occasions such as Drogo's wedding. This is comparable to how purple was traditionally the color of imperial or royal authority for centuries in Europe because purple was the most expensive color dye (it could only be made from a rare sea snail). Thus, while in Season 3 Daenerys no longer wears a Dothraki-style "cut" to her outfit, she switched to blue colors as a symbol of her authority as a khaleesi and in memory of Drogo.
