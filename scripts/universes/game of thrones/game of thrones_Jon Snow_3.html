<html><p>Daenerys later has Varys executed for treason. When Varys is burned alive by Drogon's flames, Jon is disturbed by the execution via fire. Later, Jon comes to see Daenerys, and she blames Jon for telling Sansa about her parentage for what happened. Jon states he doesn't want the crown which is what he told Varys, with Daenerys replying Sansa betrayed his trust and is as responsible for Varys' death as she is. Daenerys confides that the people of Westeros love Jon more than her, that all she has here is fear, not love. Jon tells Daenerys that he loves her and she will always be his queen. As she asks if that's all she is to him, the two kiss but Jon breaks it off, still hesitant over their blood ties. Daenerys accepts this but resigns herself to ruling by fear.

Jon leads his forces into King's Landing.
During the Battle of King's Landing, the Golden Company is caught off-guard by Drogon and as a result, is decimated by the charging Northern and Targaryen forces. The Lannister forces and people of King's Landing surrender. However, Daenerys and Drogon burn the streets filled with people as both the Targaryen and Northern forces start slaughtering the surrendered Lannister forces and civilians alike, as Jon tries in vain to hold them back. As a result, the Lannister forces clash again and Jon is forced to fight to deflect their attacks. He is horrified by the carnage that occurs despite his calls to stop it, and kills one of his soldiers trying to rape a woman. When the wildfire caches stored below the city years ago by Aerys start erupting due to Drogon's dragonfire, Jon orders his forces to evacuate.

Jon confronts Grey Worm over executing surrendered Lannister soldiers.
After the battle, Jon, Davos, and Tyrion observe in horror the ash-covered devastation wrought by Daenerys, with charred bodies strewn everywhere. Tyrion leaves for the Red Keep alone, and rejects Jon's suggestions to take some of his soldiers as guards. A little while later, Jon confronts Grey Worm and the Unsullied who are executing remaining surrendered Lannister soldiers. Grey Worm states that he has been ordered by Daenerys to execute all who followed Cersei. When Jon tries to stop him, the Unsullied and Stark soldiers almost come to blows, but Davos defuses the situation by telling Jon to take it up with the queen. As they walk away, they witness Grey Worm executing the captives.

Arya warns Jon against Daenerys.
At the Red Keep, Jon witnesses Daenerys giving a speech to her victorious forces, in which she declares she "liberated" the people of King's Landing and will "liberate" the world. Tyrion disavows his loyalty and being arrested for releasing Jaime. He then reunites with an injured Arya. Surprised, he asks why she was in King's Landing, to which Arya responds that she came to kill Cersei, but Daenerys got there first. She warns Jon that he will always be a danger to her because of his parentage and Sansa will never bend the knee to her.

Tyrion pleads with Jon to take action against Daenerys.
A while later, Jon visits the imprisoned Tyrion, who expects he'll be executed soon. Tyrion admits that Varys was right all along about Daenerys. He warns Jon that she won't stop until she has "liberated" the world and rules it all. He recounts her atrocities but Jon states it happened because of the trauma from the loss of loved ones she suffered. Tyrion states he knows Jon doesn't want to betray her and knows Jon loves her, he loved her too. He admits he is asking Jon to do a terrible thing, but advises him to take action because she is now the greatest threat to the people. He warns that he'll always be in danger because of his parentage, and asks if his sisters will ever bend the knee. Jon responds they'll always be loyal, but Tyrion reasons that Sansa told him about his parentage because she doesn't want Daenerys as the Queen. Jon responds that she can't choose, but Tyrion states he can and has to do it now.

Jon holds Daenerys after assassinating her.
Troubled, Jon walks to the Great Hall and finds Daenerys standing by the Iron Throne. Jon confronts her about her atrocities during the battle. She displays no remorse, believing it was necessary to achieve her ends. Jon tries to dissuade her from this path, urging forgiveness for Tyrion and those in King's Landing. Daenerys rejects this, saying they can't hide behind mercy and states the world they need can't be built by those loyal to the current one. Jon says they need a world of mercy and Daenerys assures that the new world she has in mind will be a good one and she knows what is good. When Jon asks about others who think they know what is good, she responds they don't get to choose. She tries to convince him to be by her side to build her new world and an anguished Jon reaffirms his allegiance to her. As they share a passionate kiss, Jon reluctantly stabs her. Daenerys collapses and dies in his arms as Jon grieves over her. Drogon approaches them after witnessing this while Jon gently lays her on the ground. Seeing his mother dead on the floor, Drogon becomes enraged and faces Jon. Jon prepares for his death, but the dragon instead melts the Iron Throne and flies away with her corpse.

Jon converses with Tyrion while being held as a prisoner.
The Unsullied imprison Jon for Daenerys's assassination. At the Great Council of 305 AC, where Jon and Tyrion are to be put on trial, only Tyrion is present with Grey Worm telling Sansa the Unsullied will decide Jon's fate. Sansa objects. Tyrion convinces Grey Worm to allow the new King of the Andals and the First Men to decide Jon's punishment since the crime was committed in Westeros. Ultimately, Bran is elected as the king and decides to exile Jon to the Night's Watch in order to avoid a war between the North and the Unsullied. The new Hand of the King, Tyrion, later visits a dejected Jon and informs him he will be exiled to the Night's Watch. When Jon asks if there still is a Night's Watch, Tyrion responds the world still needs a refuge for bastards and broken men. Jon asks if what he did was right and Tyrion responds they did it together. Jon says killing Daenerys doesn't feel right. Tyrion tells Jon to ask him again in 10 years. Jon tells Tyrion he doesn't think they'll ever meet again but Tyrion responds he might want to piss off the top of the Wall after serving a few years as the Hand.

Jon bids farewell to his family.
While being taken into exile by two wandering crows, Jon bids farewell to Bran, Sansa, and Arya at the docks. Jon congratulates Sansa on gaining independence for the North and assures her she will be a good leader when she laments they lost their king before they hug. Jon then tells Arya that she could to visit him at Castle Black, but Arya states that she isn't going back North and plans to explore the uncharted seas to the west of Westeros before the two tearfully hug. Finally, Jon kneels before the new king Bran and apologizes for not being there when he needed him, but Bran states he was "exactly where he was supposed to be."

Jon rides north of the Wall, accompanied by Tormund and the wildlings.
Some time later, Jon arrives at Castle Black and reunites with Tormund and the wildlings. Later, he dons the black cloak of a sworn brother of the Night's Watch and reunites with Ghost. He then leaves with Ghost and the wildlings for lands north of the Wall, watching forlornly as the gate to Castle Black closes behind him, and then rides into the Haunted Forest alongside them.

Personality
Since he was raised by Ned at Winterfell, Jon has adopted a clear moral compass and a true sense of honor, which he tries his hardest to abide by even when he must make a difficult decision, especially after he became Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He has always admired and idolized his father, but due to Catelyn's cold disdain for Jon, Eddard was careful not to give him more attention than his lawful children by Catelyn. Catelyn was never actively mean to Jon, but because he wasn't her own son she intentionally ignored him (as is common for bastard children), meaning that Jon grew up without a mother-figure. Nor did Jon consider Catelyn's behavior to be unusual or unexpected: it is rare for a noble to raise their bastard child alongside their lawful children, and his presence was a great insult to her honor.

While his interactions with Catelyn remained awkward or nonexistent, he was close with his half-siblings, particularly Robb and Arya. Robb was of the same age as Jon so they became playmates and comrades in training, while due to her tomboyish personality Arya was also something of a social misfit like Jon, which they bonded over. His closeness with Brandon and Rickon was proved when the latter had to leave Winterfell and Master Luwin advised them to go, Castle Black, where the old man was sure that their half-brother would keep them safe. With Sansa on the other hand, according to the talk they had when they reunited at Castle Black, the friendship has never been deep as those between Jon and the other siblings. Since then, however, Sansa proves to have great faith in her half-brother by standing up for him when he is King in the North and, when she discovers his true parentage, by seeing him as the best candidate to become King of the Seven Kingdoms. Also, when Jon is forced to join again the Night's Watch, Sansa shows great sorrow and thinks that sending Jon away is both a great unfairness and a great loss for the North.

Like many bastard children, Jon had to learn to grow up quickly. This made Jon mature and perceptive beyond his age, so he could navigate his complicated relationships within the Stark household. His bastard status has also made Jon something of a loner, solemn and somber with a desire to prove himself to society and to his father. Jon thought that the best way for a bastard in his position to gain honor and respect was to join the Night's Watch, emulating his uncle Benjen, because past social status is ignored after joining the Watch. Despite his introverted demeanor, Jon is very compassionate and protective of his fellow outcasts such as Sam, Grenn, and Pyp.

In many ways, Jon has been unusually lucky for a bastard child, given how rare it is for a lord to raise one in his own castle alongside his lawful children. For all of Jon's misgivings about not knowing his mother and Catelyn ignoring and shunning him, he was loved by his father and siblings, was never poor or hungry, but lived in a castle and had a noble's upbringing. Jon was formally educated by Maester Luwin and was trained in combat by Ser Rodrik Cassel.

Jon is an excellent swordsman and a fierce fighter. He was capable of quickly slaying numerous men in battle, and taking on highly-skilled warriors much bigger than himself such as Styr. His skills initially made him somewhat arrogant when he was a new recruit at Castle Black until Tyrion pointed out that the other recruits were all far less fortunate than he was, with some of them having never trained with a sword in their lives. This humbles Jon, and he changes his behavior to be the champion of the other downtrodden recruits and helps train them by walking them through the swordplay techniques he knows.

The Starks were an interfaith household, with Eddard and Catelyn's children being exposed to not only the religion of the Old Gods of the Forest worshiped by most Northmen, but also Catelyn's devout adherence to the Faith of the Seven. Because Jon had no real interaction with Catelyn and revered his father Eddard, he was not exposed to the Seven but proudly keeps to the Old Gods, and honors the traditions of his First Men ancestors. When Jon took his vow to become a member of the Night's Watch, he chose to do so in front of a heart tree, sacred to the Old Gods.

Jon is also fairly shy around women, and as he revealed to Samwell, he was a virgin when he joined the Night's Watch. While he was attractive enough, as a bastard son with nothing to inherit he had no realistic marriage prospects with noblewomen. Jon was even wary of having sex with random girls or prostitutes (as Theon did) because he was terrified of fathering a bastard of his own: having lived his life as a bastard, he felt that it wasn't a life another child should have to go through.

However, death has changed Jon. Despite his honorable convictions and previous commitment to the Night's Watch, his experience of being murdered by his own men and then revived has made Jon somewhat more cynical and nihilistic. No longer believing in himself and his ability to face the coming threat, due to being murdered for doing what he thought was right - Jon abandons the Night's Watch, despite knowing full well how dangerous the threat looming beyond the Wall really is. He loses his determination about fighting and becomes much more lonely and melancholic only speaking when he hasn't any other choice. Also, Jon feels remorse for hanging his former steward Olly, even though the latter did murder both him and the woman he loved. While he is wary of conflict since his return, his love for his family has brought him back into the fight. To this end, Jon chooses his family over the Night's Watch - a choice he once attempted to make when Robb marched off to war but forsook in the past. When Ramsay decides to play a "game" with Rickon, Jon once again chooses his family by attempting to save his little brother's life, even at the cost of his own life and battle plans.

The revelation that he is a Targaryen has made no difference to Jon; he has remained loyal to his roots as a Northman and a Stark, and through much suffering, many hard choices and also some mistakes, Jon proved to be a born leader. To protect his land and family, in just a few years he has risen up from being a bastard to becoming the King in the North, a prominent figure among the Free Folk.

Relationships
Main: Jon Snow and Ygritte

Ygritte: She was Jon's first love and a wildling spearwife. They meet when Jon and his group ambush a group of wildlings, at which point Jon captures Ygritte. Ygritte later escapes and leads him into a trap in which Jon is captured by the wildlings. Under orders from Qhorin Halfhand, Jon infiltrates the wildlings. During this time, Ygritte and Jon become lovers and fall in love. However, Jon ultimately chooses his vows for the Night's Watch over her. Ygritte shoots him with three arrows but due to her feelings for Jon, she couldn't bring herself to kill him. In the Battle of Castle Black, Ygritte was killed by Olly and died in Jon's arms. Later, per Tormund's suggestion that she belongs in the true North, Jon cremates her body just beyond the Wall as he grieves.
Main: Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen

Daenerys Targaryen: Jon's second love and the daughter of King Aerys II Targaryen, as well as the younger sister of Jon's father, Prince Rhaegar, making her his aunt by blood. Having been summoned from Winterfell to bend the knee to Daenerys, Jon initially refuses on the grounds that they need to focus on allying against the Night King and the army of the dead instead of worrying who rules from the Iron Throne. After witnessing the large numbers of the army of the dead, Daenerys agrees to help Jon and during their time together, they fall in love. They fight the Army of the Dead in the Battle of Winterfell, during which the Night King is defeated. With the Long Night prevented, Jon honors his pledge to help Daenerys take the Iron Throne. However, she razes King's Landing after the city surrenders, killing thousands of civilians. Unable to dissuade her from continuing this destruction, Jon reluctantly kills Daenerys, and she dies in Jon's arms as he grieves.

Behind the scenes
On the Season 3 Blu-ray, Jon narrates the Histories & Lore video "The North."
During casting for the first season, Harington competed with fellow cast members Iwan Rheon, Alfie Allen and Joe Dempsie for the role of Jon Snow. Rheon was later cast as Ramsay Snow/Bolton, Allen as Theon Greyjoy and Dempsie as Gendry. Harington remains close friends with all three.
Harington is contractually obligated to keep his hair long enough in the off-season that he can return to playing Jon Snow during actual filming - it would take longer than a full year for his hair to grow back to its full-length need for the role. To achieve Jon Snow's signature long dark hair, the TV series's hair designer Kevin Alexander first has to dye Harington's hair slightly darker; Then, to create the effect of dirty ringlets, he dampens the hair and then puts in a mixture of wax and hair putty before the hair totally dries. This combination keeps the curls soft and movable - if they were put on dry hair it would make it stiff.
Despite initial claims from Harington, Benioff, and Weiss that Jon had been killed off for good following the fifth season, Harington later hinted that Jon would return in some way, which was proven true in the sixth season. Harington confirmed that he had been told to lie to the rest of the cast and even his friends and family. Sophie Turner, who plays Sansa Stark, apparently believed him, while Liam Cunningham, who plays Davos Seaworth, did not (reportedly laughingly telling Harington to "fuck off"). Even the rest of the cast were forced to assert that Jon was dead, such as Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, while Natalie Dormer said that Jon was "dead right now.....right now", hinting that he would return. Throughout production, the name "Jon Snow" was not even allowed to be mentioned except for script-readouts; he was referred to only as "LC" (Lord Commander). Rampant speculation broke out after the leaking of a photograph which showed Harington as Jon wearing the outfit of a House Stark soldier, fueling fans' beliefs that Jon was not gone for good. The first poster released for the sixth season featured a bloodied-but-apparently-alive Jon, further teasing that Jon would return. After the airing of "Home", Harington issued a public apology to the series' fanbase for lying to everyone and expressed appreciation for the fans' love for his character.
While shooting Jon's showdown with Ramsay in "Battle of the Bastards", Harington actually punched Iwan Rheon twice by accident, though Rheon was not seriously hurt. In real life, despite having only appeared onscreen together in one episode of the entire series, Harington and Rheon are close friends.
Marcus Shakesheff was a stunt double for Kit Harington in the role of Jon Snow.
In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Jon is 14 years old when the story begins. Jon resembles his father with a lean build, long face, and gray eyes, more than any of his true-born children (except Arya, to an extent, but she is a girl, while he looks very much like a young version of Eddard). Jon loves his half-siblings and among them, is closest with Robb and Arya.

Unlike in the television series, Jon has never been on good terms with Theon. Jon feels Theon is an "ass" and Theon feels Jon is jealous of his highborn status. Meanwhile, Theon resents Jon for being bastard-born but treated better than him by Eddard.

Eddard refuses to reveal who Jon's mother is, which wounds and haunts Jon. Jon often wonders about his mother and why Eddard will not say anything about her. While Jon loves and is loved by his family, he feels a sense of alienation from them because of his bastard status and the coldness of Eddard's wife. Catelyn views Jon as an interloper in her family and resents that Eddard brought Jon to live at Winterfell with her true-born children.

At the feast to welcome King Robert, Jon is unable to sit with his family as he usually does because Catelyn fears that the king or queen would take insult at sharing a table with a bastard. Instead, Jon sits with squires at another table. This coincides with the visit by his uncle Benjen, and (emboldened by having more than he is used to drinking) makes Jon realize that his future may lie outside Winterfell's walls. His uncle frustrates Jon by telling him to wait a few years before deciding, but when Eddard decides to go to King's Landing, Catelyn refuses to allow Jon to remain behind at Winterfell. Catelyn was relieved because when Jon joined the Watch he forsook any right to inheritance, and could never challenge her own sons for Winterfell. Nor did Catelyn have to pressure Jon into joining: he went to the Wall of his own volition, albeit because he had been raised on legends of the former glories of the Night's Watch.

There is no mention in the books that Jon caught the pox as a child and Catelyn, out of guilt, prayed for him to survive: in A Game of Thrones, Catelyn states outright that she wishes it was Jon who had fallen from the broken tower in Bran's place.

Jon is crestfallen to discover that the Watch is now a glorified penal colony, full of murderers, rapers, and other outcasts, and few of the recruits are like his uncle.

The prostitute character Ros was invented for the TV series, so Jon never tried to have sex with her only to back down from it in the end out of fear of fathering a bastard - though the novels do have Jon make some similar statements that he is horrified at the thought of creating bastard children of his own who would be looked down upon with nothing to inherit, as he grew up, thus the overall point that Jon didn't really have any experience with women before joining the Watch basically stands.

Jon severely burned his right hand when he killed the wight Othor to save Jeor Mormont's life. While he lost no function in it, as a result of the burns his right hand and some of his forearm were left covered in scar tissue, which would never heal back to normal. People tend not to notice, because in the cold temperatures at the Wall and beyond, Jon and other members of the Night's Watch usually wear heavy gloves over both hands.

Jon didn't see a White Walker taking one of Craster's sons in the forest as he did in the TV series. When Mance Rayder later asks him why he would betray the Night's Watch to join the wildlings, Jon instead point out that it is because he will always be treated with scorn as a bastard, pointing out how back at the feast of Winterfell he wasn't allowed to sit at the main table with the "real" Starks.

After Jon kills Orell, part of Orell's consciousness survives by warging into his eagle, after which Orell's mind controlling the eagle's body attempts to claw out Jon's eye with its talons (which occurred in Season 3 of the TV series). The attack leaves permanent deep scars over Jon's eye. However, rather than disfiguring him, characters within the narrative point out that they think it makes him ruggedly handsome. Stereotypical Fantasy heroes usually never get significantly hurt, at worst getting scars running over their eyes which make them look "cool." Author George R.R. Martin spent much of the books deconstructing or subverting traditional Fantasy literature stereotypes, making Westeros a gritty and realistic setting where instead of all of the main characters miraculously surviving through battles unscathed, some are horribly maimed (i.e. Jaime and Tyrion do not get dashingly roguish scars over their eyes - they outright lose their sword hand and nose, respectively). In contrast, Jon actually does behave like a traditionally heroic character, but put in the dark setting of Westeros - and as a result, Jon does end up getting "cool hero scars" over his eye.

The subplot in Season 4 in which Jon returns to Craster's Keep to finish off the mutineers there (that never occurs in the novels), and nearly encounters Bran again, was an invention of the TV series: in the books, the Battle of Castle Black begins soon after Jon returns, but due to the way the TV seasons were split, Jon returned at the end of Season 3 - even though the battle would only take place as the climax at the end of Season 4. Jon, therefore, had to have something to do in the earlier parts of the season.

Unbeknownst to Jon, late in the third novel Robb names him as his heir: since Jeyne Westerling has not given him heirs yet, Bran and Rickon are reported as dead, Arya is missing, and Sansa was forced to marry Tyrion - the Lannisters could lay claim to the North. Robb realizes that he needs to name a new heir, because if he dies there will be no obvious successor to challenge the Lannister's claim through Sansa, and decides Jon is the best choice - given that Robb is a king, he can simply issue a decree legitimizing Jon. Catelyn pleads with Robb not to choose Jon, and instead pick a very distant cousin from House Royce, but Robb does not listen to her. He signs the decree in the presence of several of his northern lords as witnesses. However, it is unknown what has become of the decree, as it is no longer mentioned in the books. It is speculated that Robb has given it to Maege Mormont and Galbart Glover, whom he sent on a mission to seek out Howland Reed (therefore they do not attend the Red Wedding), but their current location is unknown. So far in the books, Jon has not received the decree, and has no idea of its existence.

Jon is tempted by Stannis's offer to make him Lord of Winterfell, but feels guilt and shame over this due to his love for his lost trueborn siblings, whom Jon believes have all passed away (later, in A Dance with Dragons, Jon becomes aware Sansa is alive, although he does not know her current whereabouts, and tells Stannis that Winterfell belongs to her by right). Jon likewise has reservations because he is an illegitimate son and is bound by his oath to the Watch. Stannis assures Jon he can legitimize him, and Winterfell can be rebuilt. As for the oath: Melisandre tells Jon "R'hllor is the only true god. A vow sworn to a tree has no more power than one sworn to your shoes. Open your heart and let the light of the Lord come in. Burn these weirwoods, and accept Winterfell as a gift of the Lord of Light." Jon thinks it over, recalling how when he was very young, too young to understand what it meant to be a bastard, he used to dream that one day Winterfell might be his. Later, when he was older, he had been ashamed of those dreams. Now, in order to claim his father's castle, he must turn against his father's gods. The more Jon thinks about it, he grows to loathe the notion of destroying the weirwood of Winterfell. He looks at Ghost, whose white fur and red eyes remind him of a heart tree, and Jon remembers finding the direwolf pups in the late summer snow with Robb - five grey, black, and brown pups for the five trueborn children and a sixth one, "white as snow." This is what makes him reject the legitimization offer. Had Jon accepted the offer, it is doubtful the people of the north would have accepted him as their Lord - who is both an oathbreaker and a defiler of the old gods.

In the books, after Jon is elected the new Lord Commander, he knows he must deal with Slynt and Thorne, who did their best to get him killed and will probably undermine him. Jon wouldn't abuse his authority in order to settle the score with them (especially with Slynt, who took part in Ned's downfall and subsequent death, which Jon is aware of); he firmly reminds himself that once someone joins the Watch - his past deeds are erased clean. He wisely decides to separate between the cronies, send Slynt away and keep Throne - whom he considers the more dangerous - close to him. Jon orders Slynt to take command of Greyguard and restore it, but Slynt refuses three times, with an extremely obnoxious and disrespectful manner. Jon executes Janos Slynt for that insubordination, and is somewhat disappointed that Alliser Thorne did not attempt to defend him. Later, Jon sends Thorne and eight other rangers to scout beyond the Wall. Throne obeys, but does not leave quietly: he ominously warns Jon that he will return to Castle Black, one way or another. Thorne has not returned yet and his fate is unknown, therefore he is not among those who attack Jon later.

One of the goals that Jon intends to achieve as the new Lord Commander of the Watch is to restore and garrison as many of the sixteen abandoned castles as possible, by both members of the Watch and wildlings. So far, most of those castles have been garrisoned, but are badly undermanned.

Stannis often consults with Jon, who serves as his unofficial advisor, about his next moves. Jon is aware that by advising Stannis, he is walking on very thin ice: the Watch must not get involved in the political conflicts south of the Wall; on the other hand, the Watch owes Stannis a great debt: without him, the wildlings would have eventually overcome the defenders of Castle Black. Jon dissuades Stannis from taking ill-advised actions that can be disastrous to him, like granting northern castles to southron lords and the plan to attack the Dreadfort (an idea brought up by the treacherous Arnolf Karstark, who secretly collaborates with the Boltons); instead, he advises Stannis to gain the support of the Northern mountain clans and to liberate Deepwood Motte from the ironborn. Stannis accepts both advices, and as a result, his position greatly improves: he gains the support of many northern houses, and his army grows more than three times.

Unbeknown to Jon, Cersei plots against him: she receives his letter that the Night's Watch takes no side, asking for arms and manpower, but has given Stannis food and shelter. She informs that to the council, claiming this is treason. Most of the council members suggest imposing sanctions on the Night's Watch. Qyburn has a more devious plan: to send a hundred men to the Wall, allegedly to take the black, but in truth to kill Jon. Cersei accepts Qyburn's advice and intends to send Osney Kettleblack with a hundred men to the Wall for that purpose, but as things turn to be, that scheme is never executed.

Though Jon initially has the support of almost the entire Night's Watch, he earns the distrust of most by proposing an alliance with the wildlings so that they will not fall into the hands of the White Walkers. 

In the meantime, Melisandre tells Jon of visions she has had concerning "daggers in the dark" and a girl in grey riding on a dying horse for Castle Black, running away from a forced marriage, claiming it is his sister Arya. Jon initially believes the girl in question is indeed Arya, whom he hears is marrying Ramsay Bolton; the girl, however, turns to be neither Arya nor her impostor, but Alys Karstark, who informs Jon of the Karstarks' plan to betray Stannis to the Boltons. Unfortunately, Melisandre's mistake results in Jon ignoring her warning about "daggers in the dark", which turns to be correct.

Jon, loyal to his oaths, states that he has no sister and cannot help her, although he is anxious to. Melisandre, however, reveals to Jon that Mance Rayder is actually still alive, since she used her powers to disguise him as Rattleshirt (and Rattleshirt as Mance, which led him to being burned in Mance's place). She persuades Jon to send Mance to rescue Arya from Winterfell.

Jon also meets Tycho Nestoris, a representative of the Iron Bank of Braavos who has come to negotiate with Stannis, due to Cersei's consistent refusal to pay the crown's debts. Jon secures a loan from Nestoris for ships and food for the Night's Watch, and instructs him on where to find Stannis and warn him of the Karstarks' betrayal.

Jon arranges a mission to Hardhome to rescue the remaining wildlings there; unlike in the show, he does not join the mission himself, but instead sends Cotter Pyke there. Some time later, Jon receives desperate reports by messenger-raven that they are under siege by wights.

As Jon prepares to head out to Hardhome to rescue them, he receives a letter from Ramsay (often referred to as "the Pink Letter"), who taunts Jon by claiming that he has killed Stannis, destroyed his army and taken Mance prisoner, and demanding his bride, "Reek", Melisandre, Stannis's family, Mance's son and sister-in-law. Ramsay closes the letter by threatening to march on the Wall and destroy the Night's Watch if Jon does not agree, and "I will cut out your bastard heart and eat it."

Jon now realizes that he can't defend Castle Black from attack from the south (the Wall is located north of the castle) even as the Boltons are tearing the realm apart from the south. He reads the letter aloud in Castle Black's courtyard, and announces that he will ride south to confront and kill Ramsay himself - which might be construed as breaking the Watch's strict vow of political neutrality. Jon argues that the neutrality goes both ways, and Ramsay cannot just threaten to kill the head of the Night's Watch with impunity. Jon ultimately receives a very similar letter in the TV series, although it is after his resurrection - and unlike in the novels, Sansa is there to witness it (Sansa never married Ramsay in the novels, so this change was thrown in to increase the emotional impact of the scene - which could also explain delaying the letter until after Jon abandoned the Night's Watch).

But this is the last straw for many of the older Watch officers who were growing increasingly annoyed at Jon's decisions, especially about accepting the wildlings to the Watch. Moreover, they had the somewhat legitimate fear that if Jon fought Ramsay and lost, the Boltons would destroy the entire Night's Watch on the accusation that they were implicit in his actions. As Jon is preparing to leave, a fight breaks out with the giant Wun Wun. Jon tries to talk everyone down to prevent more loss of life and the mutineers choose the moment to stab Jon. The mutineers are led not by Alliser Thorne (who has been sent earlier by Jon to scout beyond the Wall and has not returned, his fate is unknown) but by Bowen Marsh, who openly weeps as he does so very reluctantly and says "for the Watch." Subsequent mutineers each walk up and stab Jon as well, but as he loses consciousness he doesn't recognize them (the chapter is narrated from Jon's POV). Olly is not present as the character was invented for the TV series and doesn't exist in the novels - he is loosely a condensation of half a dozen other characters Jon trusted. Jon collapses, smoke rising from his wounds, and the last word he utters is "Ghost..." as he hears his direwolf howling.

Jon's resurrection in the television series implies that he will return in The Winds of Winter.

R+L=J
There were numerous hints since the first novel that Eddard was lying about who Jon's mother was, and that he might even be the son of Eddard's sister Lyanna and Rhaegar, making Jon the secret heir to the Iron Throne. In the twenty years since the first novel was released through Season 6 of the TV series, this theory was popularly known in the books' fandom by the abbreviation "R+L=J" - for "Rhaegar + Lyanna = Jon." The theory was confirmed to be half true in the Season 6 finale when it was revealed that Lyanna was Jon's mother. A few days later HBO released an info graph revealing that Rhaegar is Jon's father, fully confirming the theory to be true.

Various hints included that Eddard gave inconsistent and indeed contradicting accounts of who Jon's mother was, indicating that he was lying about something, and also the conspicuous fact that Lyanna died shortly before Ned returned to the North with the infant Jon: hinting that Lyanna died in childbirth. There were also many hints (still unconfirmed) that Lyanna didn't actually love Robert, and she ran off with Rhaegar - particularly that everyone except for Robert himself describes Rhaegar as a chivalrous, intellectual, kind man who didn't seem the sort to randomly rape the daughter of a major noble House. Another major hint was that Rhaegar had the three greatest members of the Kingsguard (two in the TV version) including Arthur Dayne sit out the entire war, purely to guard Lyanna at the Tower of Joy.

Unbeknownst to Jon, his half-brother Aegon Targaryen, the son of Rhaegar and Elia Martell, is alive, as revealed in the fifth novel; he has recently arrived at Westeros with his guardian Jon Connington and nearly half of the Golden Company, to claim his birthright. It should be noted that Aegon's book character has not been merged with Jon's show character, just because they have the same first name; Aegon is considered dead in the show.

It has long been believed in Westeros that only members of the Targaryen bloodline can easily bond with and ride dragons - which is one of the reasons they so readily accepted Daenerys (though that was also because she hatched them, becoming their adoptive mother). The revelation about Jon's real parentage means that he may potentially bond with one of Daenerys's three dragons in a future novel - after all, she has three dragons but only personally rides Drogon, the largest. To a lesser extent, this might also be true of the Baratheons - Robert was Rhaegar's second cousin in the books. With the deaths of Stannis and Shireen in the TV series, the only living member of the Baratheon bloodline is Robert's bastard son Gendry (who is, in fact, Jon's third cousin). House Martell also intermarried with the Targaryens but not recently, about a century ago: in the books Doran Martell's middle son Quentyn (cut from the TV show) traveled to Meereen and explicitly hoped his small amount of Targaryen blood would be enough to make the dragons trust him and try to mount one, but he got roasted alive instead.
