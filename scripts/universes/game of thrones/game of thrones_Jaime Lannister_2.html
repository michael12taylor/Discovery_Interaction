<html><p>Jaime and Cersei later visit Qyburn's lab accompanied by Gregor Clegane. As Cersei asks Qyburn to sway more of Varys' spies to her cause, Jaime wonders aloud on the ex-maester's treatment of Clegane, causing the Mountain to glare at him in anger. After meeting Qyburn, Jaime, Cersei and Gregor interrupt a small council meeting to demand a discussion on what to do about the Sparrows and Ellaria Sand's coup in Dorne. Kevan and Olenna remind Cersei of her place, but Jaime, being Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, asserts he can stay. Instead, Kevan and the Council refuse to continue to meet while Gregor Clegane is present and promptly leave the council chamber.

Later, after Cersei learns from Tommen that the High Sparrow means to have Margaery perform a Walk of Atonement, she and Jaime try to appeal to the Council again. This time, they agree to work together to remove the High Sparrow from power. Jaime convinces his uncle to keep the Lannister forces in reserve but have the Tyrell army go to the Great Sept of Baelor and free Margaery and Loras, though Kevan warns that the High Sparrow has many supporters and thousands could die in the ensuing civil war.

Jaime arrives with a Tyrell army in an attempt to free Ser Loras and Queen Margaery from the Sparrows.
Jaime meets Mace Tyrell and his army by the city gate and rides with the Lord of Highgarden to the Great Sept. As the High Sparrow is addressing the crowd, the Tyrell force marches into the square at the foot of the Sept's stairs. Just as it seems it will come to blood, the High Sparrow announces he will be releasing Margaery due to a new alliance between the Crown and the Faith, and Tommen emerges from the Sept with the rest of the Kingsguard. Jaime is shocked and enraged, and he gives the High Sparrow a scornful glare.

Cersei orders Jaime retake Riverrun.
After the failed attempt at the Great Sept, Tommen removes Jaime from the Kingsguard. He commands him to take an army to Riverrun, which was recently captured by the Blackfish and the Tully army, and help the Freys retake the castle. Jaime later informs Cersei of this, angry that the High Sparrow has swayed Tommen to his side and threatening to attack the Sept with help from Bronn and other sellswords. Instead, Cersei advises Jaime to lead the Lannister forces to Riverrun, confident the Mountain will win her trial by combat. She kisses Jaime goodbye, reminding him their enemies have always underestimated them.

Jaime reinforces House Frey's forces at the Siege of Riverrun.
Jaime arrives at Riverrun accompanied by Bronn and an army of 8,000 Lannisters. He witnesses Lothar Frey and Black Walder Rivers threatening to kill Edmure Tully if the Blackfish doesn't surrender. Knowing his nephew is too valuable to lose, the Blackfish dismisses them and Edmure is spared. Jaime remarks on the Freys' poor attempts at siege warfare and points out that threatening to hang Edmure and then not doing so makes them look weak. To prove his point, he threatens to strike Black Walder if he speaks again; when Black Walder begins to answer, Jaime slaps him hard with his armored hand, drawing blood. Jaime assumes command of the siege and orders Edmure to be washed and fed. Jaime then sends word to Brynden that he wishes to parley.  

Jaime meets with the Blackfish.
He comes face to face with Brynden, but it quickly becomes clear that the Blackfish is not interested in surrendering. He asks Jaime whether he has come to honor his vow to his niece and return her two daughters. Brynden quips that "negotiating with an oathbreaker is like building on quicksand", declaring that he is ready to die in his home. He challenges Jaime to either storm the castle or try to starve them out, claiming that they have two years worth of provisions. Brynden then asks Jaime, "Do you have two years?"

Jaime discusses Sansa with Brienne during the siege of Riverrun.
A few days into the siege, Brienne arrives at Riverrun to seek an alliance with House Tully to fight the Boltons. As she and Jaime discuss the situation privately in a tent, Bronn asks Pod if he thinks they are having sex and says that Jaime would definitely have sex with her. Meanwhile, Brienne tells Jaime that she fulfilled their oath to Catelyn Stark and explains Sansa's desire for aid from the Blackfish. She proposes that if she can convince the Blackfish to surrender the castle, then Jaime will allow him and the Tully army safe passage to the North. 

Brienne offers Oathkeeper to Jaime.
Jaime agrees and allows Brienne to enter Riverrun and try to convince Brynden to surrender. She then removes Oathkeeper and tries to return it to Jaime, since the purpose he lent it to her for (rescuing Sansa) has been fulfilled, but he refuses to take it back, saying that it's hers now. Brienne reminds him that her oath to Sansa will obligate her to fight him if her efforts to find a peaceful solution should fail if he attacks the castle. Jaime responds by saying that he hopes that it does not come to that.

Jaime threatens Edmure.
After Brienne fails to persuade the Blackfish, Jaime visits Edmure to offer him a deal, trying to tempt him with seeing his son and sending him, his son and his wife, Roslin Frey to Casterly Rock, offering them comfortable rooms. Jaime promises that Edmure's son will be taken care of, that he will be given knights to train, and a keep of his own desire when he comes of age. Edmure ridicules Jaime. Jaime, realising he cannot peacefully try to persuade Edmure into surrendering the castle, responds by warning him that people can do anything for love, threatening that he will kill every Tully in order to be able to return to King's Landing and be with Cersei again. With his family's life credibly threatened, Edmure agrees to cooperate.

Jaime convinces Edmure Tully to surrender Riverrun without casualty.
Despite Brynden's protests, the gates are opened to Edmure and Jaime takes the castle without bloodshed. On the castle walls, Jaime is informed of the Blackfish's death, leaving him visibly saddened. He then witnesses Brienne and Podrick escaping in a boat, but allows them to leave, waving goodbye to Brienne.

Jaime during the feast at the Twins.
Jaime then marches to the Twins with the Freys as they celebrate their retaking of Riverrun. Jaime notices a serving girl who smiles at him. Bronn then complains that all the women desire Jaime, who then calls over two young girls and introduces them to the knight. He then speaks to Walder Frey, who gloats about their victory. When Walder attempts to equate himself with Jaime, calling them both kingslayers, Jaime is visibly irritated. Walder goes on to say that fear is a marvelous thing but Jaime retorts that people fear the Lannisters, not the Freys, and questions the need for the Freys if the Lannisters have to keep helping the Freys hold the Riverlands. Walder does not respond and Jaime brusquely leaves. Walder and his sons, Black Walder and Lothar, are later murdered by the same serving girl that smiled at Jaime earlier, who reveals herself to be Arya Stark. 

Jaime watches as Cersei is crowned Queen, knowing what she did to obtain it.
Upon returning to King’s Landing, Jaime, Bronn, and the Lannister forces are shocked to see the Great Sept in ruins. That evening, Jaime arrives at the throne room of the Red Keep in time to witness Cersei’s coronation, but is visibly displeased that Tommen, their last child, is dead and his sister-lover has committed the very atrocity that Jaime prevented at such great personal cost when he killed the Mad King.

Season 7
Jaime stands with Cersei during her audience with Euron Greyjoy.
Cersei and Jaime discuss their strategy and their enemies. Jaime points out their lack of allies and questions Cersei's power. He expresses his will to discuss Tommen's suicide, but she refuses, calling their youngest child a traitor. She later reveals that she has considered a new ally, Euron Greyjoy. Euron arrives to ask Cersei to marry, but she declines, stating that she cannot trust him. Jaime then reminisces about Euron's primary role in the Greyjoy Rebellion, including the Sack of Lannisport and is less then impressed when Euron proposes to Cersei, but is relieved when she refuses his proposal.

Jaime persuades Randyll of Olenna's dishonor.
Jaime is present when Cersei convenes a court of Reachmen, including Randyll Tarly, who are asked to betray their oaths to Olenna Tyrell, who has recently joined forces with Daenerys. Jaime then manages to get Randyll on his own, after a brief confusion of names with his son, Dickon Tarly, who is mistaken as "Rickard" to Jaime. He then makes it clear that Randyll is the most prominent of the lords of the Reach, and that the others will look to him when choosing sides. Despite Jaime mentioning the possibility of the Dothraki invading his lands, Randyll still announces that he doesn't wish to be dishonorable to Olenna. Jaime then promises to give him the title of Warden of the South, should they succeed in triumphing over Daenerys.

Jaime and Euron converse over Cersei.
Jaime is present when Euron Greyjoy presents his captives of Yara Greyjoy and Ellaria and Tyene Sand as his promised gift to Cersei. As they stand beside the throne as Cersei proclaims Euron commander of her naval forces as well as assuring him of her hand in marriage once the war is won, Jaime quietly mutters that the same people who cheered for Euron would do the same if Cersei put his head on a spike. Euron ignores the jab, but responds with one of his own by asking Jaime for advice on how Cersei enjoys sex. A furious Jaime almost lunges at Euron, but Euron, delighted at having provoked him, gleefully tells Jaime to save it for later, in a not so public place.

Soon after, Jaime is seen dining in his chambers when Cersei enters the room, and proceeds to disrobe him. They have sex, and then the next morning, they are woken by a servant ringing the doorbell. Jaime urges Cersei to ignore it, and expresses shock when she decides to answer the door, as nobody should see him sleeping in Cersei's bed, but Cersei retorts that she is the Queen and can do whatever she wants. When Cersei opens the door, the servant tells her that the representative from the Iron Bank of Braavos is ready to meet with her, and her eyes catch on to the sight of Jaime in Cersei's bed, before quickly walking away. Cersei smiles as Jaime's concern turns to amusement.

Jaime prepares to sack Highgarden.
Jaime is next seen leading the combined Lannister-Tarly army, along with Bronn, Randyll and Dickon Tarly in the final assault against Highgarden. In the aftermath of the assault and the massacre of the castle's Tyrell garrison, passing through his own soldiers counting up the spoils of victory, Jaime confronts Olenna Tyrell in her study. Jaime notes that the Tyrell forces fought bravely, whereupon Olenna acknowledges warfare was not House Tyrell's strong point. Olenna observes that Tyrion and Daenerys thought the bulk of the Lannister forces would be defending Casterly Rock against the Unsullied attack. Jaime, while pouring two glasses of wine, reveals it was a ruse, explaining that his ancestral home is now practically worthless, aside from childhood sentiment; a token garrison was left behind and the Rock's food stores were emptied before they fled. He also states Euron's Iron Fleet will have destroyed the attacking fleet, leaving the Unsullied trapped deep in Westeros at the mercy of Lannister forces. Meanwhile, the main Lannister army would be far away from the main attack, a strategic move Jaime learnt from Robb Stark's attack at the Whispering Wood. Olenna wonders why Tywin Lannister didn't just take Highgarden when Casterly Rock's mines first ran out of gold. Knowing her end is near, she remarks that she may ask Tywin himself soon enough.

Olenna asks Jaime how he intends to kill her, speculating he will kill her with Widow's Wail, Joffrey Baratheon's old sword. Remarking on Joffrey's horrible nature, Olenna proudly admits that she enacted measures to protect her family at all costs, with no regrets, but reflects that her actions pale in comparison to the atrocities performed by Cersei. She tells Jaime that Cersei is a monster; a matter of opinion according to Jaime. While some may dread her, Jaime insists that none will care what she has done, so long as order is restored. Olenna observes that Jaime really does love his sister, and calls him a fool, claiming that she will be the end of him, and that by the time he realizes what a disease Cersei is, it will be far too late for him. Jaime considers this a moot point, of little value discussing with Olenna, although she points out that as an experienced person about to die, she is the perfect person to discuss his life with.

Olenna tells Jaime of her role in Joffrey's murder.
Olenna again asks Jaime how he plans to kill her. Jaime tells her of Cersei’s idea of having her whipped and beheaded, or flayed alive and hanged, but he talked her out of those ideas. He then produces a small phial and empties its contents into one of the glasses of wine, giving it to Olenna who then drinks it after Jaime confirms that it will be a painless death. Olenna reflects on the horrible way that Joffrey died, and the gruesome details that the poison caused; she admits that part was unintentional on her part, as she had never seen the strangler work in person before. Shocked into silence, Jaime stares at her, realizing at last who really killed his eldest son and let his brother take the blame, setting in motion the deaths of Oberyn Martell, Tywin Lannister, and Myrcella Baratheon. Satisfied at his horror, Olenna insists that he tell Cersei that she was the one who murdered her son, whereafter a furious Jaime storms out, leaving Olenna to die.

Jaime seizes the Tyrell gold.
Later, Jaime coordinates the soldiers loading up the spoils of war for transport after the sack of Highgarden allowed them to seize all of House Tyrell's substantial gold stores, which they send ahead to King's Landing first, before moving on to securing grain shipments. Jaime procures a large bag of gold coins and gives it to Bronn as payment for his services. Bronn, however, is annoyed that this isn't the full reward he was promised, which included a wife from the nobility and a castle. He then half-seriously asks why Jaime doesn't just grant him Highgarden, as they need someone to rule it. Jaime waves this aside by saying they don't actually intend to hold Highgarden for long as it would be difficult for Bronn of all people to rule over hostile territory, and the war isn't over yet, so at this point he thinks Bronn should be satisfied with a more movable big sack of gold than a castle he'll have trouble defending. Bronn, however, is not amused.

Some time later, Jaime's Lannister army has advanced much farther east along the Goldroad, in the northeast of the Reach. Lord Randyll Tarly comes to Jaime and says they should hurry to get all of their grain wagons over the Blackwater Rush to King's Landing on the northern side, as they will be vulnerable if their formation is caught on both sides of the river. Jaime agrees, but Randyll suggests flogging the stragglers to motivate them. Jaime urges that his soldiers fought well at Highgarden, however, and he should at least give them a fair warning first instead of launching right into the flogging. Jaime and Bronn then encounter Randyll's son Dickon Tarly again. Jaime asks what he thought of his first taste of battle, and he nervously claims it was glorious - only to then dejectedly admit that he was quite conflicted: House Tarly had been loyal vassals of the Tyrells for generations; he knew many of the men they killed, even hunted side by side with them. Jaime earnestly advises the young man that the guilt is not his but Olenna Tyrell's as she was the one who chose to side with Daenerys's foreign army against Queen Cersei, so it is truly Olenna's fault they died and the fact that Dickon wasn't involved with the decision making process on either side means he shouldn't dwell on it. Dickon then outright confesses that the aftermath was horrible, notably the smell of all the fresh corpses. Bronn playfully taunts that Dickon, a sheltered nobleman, finally found out that men void their bowels when they die.

Jaime and Bronn spot the Dothraki horde.
Upon reaching the Goldroad by the Blackwater river, Jaime and Bronn are surprised to hear what sounds like distant thunder, until they realize it must be approaching cavalry. Jaime and Randyll shout for their soldiers to form up, which they manage to do before the enemy crests over the horizon - a massive, 100,000 strong horde of Dothraki cavalry. Bronn insists that Jaime should just leave and ride ahead to King's Landing, but Jaime insists he will not abandon his men. Bronn bluntly tells him the Dothraki will swamp the Lannister lines and Jaime is too valuable as a commander to stay and fight, but Jaime insists that they have a chance if they hold.

Jaime spots Daenerys Targaryen and her dragon Drogon.
At that moment, they hear a roar not heard on the battlefields of Westeros in over a century and a half, and look above the Dothraki horde to see a huge adult dragon heading straight for their lines - Drogon, ridden by Daenerys Targaryen herself. Drogon outpaces the Dothraki, and at Daenerys's command "Dracarys!", he blasts a torrent of fire through the Lannister ranks in a straight line from front to back, punching a hole in their formation. The highly mobile Dothraki light cavalry immediately sweep through it and wheel around to catch those parts of the Lannister lines in an envelopment.

Jaime and Bronn lead the Lannister-Tarly forces.
The Lannister-Tarly lines around Jaime and Randyll manage to rally under their leadership, however: the Dothraki charge into the Lannister lines head-on, but meet stiff resistance as their spear wall holds firm. Though they are outnumbered, the Lannister soldiers are better armed heavy infantry, highly disciplined and battle-hardened veterans from years of war. Dothraki horse-archers let off shots before charging into their ranks, but highly trained Tarly archers return fire, doing as much if not more damage as the Dothraki wear less armor.

Jaime witnesses Drogon in action.
The Lannister army gives as good as it takes for a time, but their enemy has the advantage of weight in numbers, and the tide turns slowly against them. For a moment it looks like Jaime might at least be able to force the Dothraki to a standstill - but then Daenerys wheels out of the air again, devastating the Lannister formations. No longer trying to punch vertical holes through their lines, she switches to flanking the Lannister ranks, burning a vast horizontal swath of men from left to right. Men are flash-burned into nothing but ash which crumbles upon the touch. Men are cooked alive in their own superheated armor as they struggled to rip it off.

Jaime rallies the Tarly archers.
Nonetheless, Jaime manages to rally his remaining forces a second time, desperately taking command of a group of surviving Lannister and Tarly archers and directing them to concentrate their fire at the dragon: Drogon might not be vulnerable to common arrow fire, but his rider is. If they can manage to kill Daenerys herself, who has risked appearing in open battle, the entire war could end in a day, no matter their losses. Daenerys sees the attack coming, however, and banks Drogon up so the arrow volley harmlessly bounces off the armored scales on his belly. 

Jaime watches his army burn.
He then blasts the archer formations with fire. Jaime avoids the flames and is surrounded by enemies, but he manages to carve a path through the Dothraki with his sword Widow's Wail to try to reach safety. He nearly gets attacked by a Dothraki from behind at one point, but Dickon Tarly kills the Dothraki first, saving him. Even then all is not lost - Jaime also commanded Bronn to reach Qyburn's anti-dragon scorpion-bolt launcher, which they took with them in the wagon train for just this scenario (as Jaime cannot fire it one-handed). Bronn spots the dragon in the distance, and fires but misses. Daenerys is startled by the scorpion-bolt flying a few feet from her head, scans the battlefield, and spots Bronn on the scorpion as he reloads. 

Jaime sees an opportunity when Drogon is wounded.

Bronn eventually manages to shoot Drogon in the shoulder, but the scorpion is destroyed immediately after by Drogon's dragonfire. To Jaime's disadvantage, the dragon's armored scales are so tough that the scorpion bolt only managed to cause superficial damage. Nonetheless the flesh wound grounds him, and he howls in pain and fury, destroying any masses of enemy soldiers that get near him. Daenerys sets him down and dismounts to try and pull the scorpion bolt out.
Jaime charges at Daenerys.
Jaime, however, sees that Daenerys is grounded and immobilized, and realizes he still has one chance; if he can kill Daenerys, even now, he can end her invasion. Jaime grabs a spear and charges his horse across the flaming battlefield to make a death-run for Daenerys as she tends to her dragon. Tyrion, who is watching the battle from a safe distance along with the Dothraki commanders, swears under his breath, calling his brother a "fucking idiot", angry that he's going to get himself killed. Just as Jaime is nearly on top of Daenerys, however, Drogon notices him amidst the chaos of the battle; shielding Daenerys behind his head, the dragon lets out a blast of flame, but Bronn rushes over to tackle Jaime out of the way, saving him from certain death.

Bronn rescues Jaime from drowning in his armor.
They both fall into the river, where Jaime is weighed down by his armor, and sinks beneath the waters, in danger of drowning. Jaime is pulled ashore by Bronn, who rebukes him for making such a reckless gamble. Realizing there is no chance their armies can beat Daenerys Targaryen at war, especially if she makes use of all three dragons, Jaime knows he must tell Cersei the bad news, to which Bronn suggests it may be better if he jumped back into the water. 

Jaime returns to King's Landing.
When he arrives back at King's Landing, he brings the news of their defeat, and that fighting Daenerys is suicide, only to be rebuffed by Cersei's overconfidence in the Iron Bank and the mercenaries that can be hired with the ransacked gold of Highgarden. As promised, he also tells Cersei it was Olenna who had murdered Joffrey, to her initial disbelief; however, as Jaime talks her through it, pointing out that Olenna had far more to gain from killing Joffrey than Tyrion, Cersei is forced to concede he is telling the truth, and angrily berates Jaime for talking her into giving Olenna a merciful death. Jaime insists that House Lannister will follow House Tyrell into the grave if the war continues, but Cersei, to his dismay, makes it plain she intends to fight on to the bitter end, both of them knowing that Daenerys will do the same, and is more dangerous with the victory she has just achieved. Cersei surmises to say that she would rather fight and die, as she knows she will be killed even if she surrenders.

Jaime meets with Tyrion.
Later, Bronn brings Jaime to the catacombs of the Red Keep for a secret training session, but Jaime finds Tyrion waiting for him. Though genuinely upset with his brother, Jaime agrees to hear him out, and Tyrion explains that Daenerys is requesting an armistice to defeat the White Walkers, before continuing the war at hand. Upon returning to his sister's chambers, Jaime relays this information to Cersei. After Cersei seemingly agrees to the ceasefire, she informs Jaime she is now pregnant with his child. A stunned Jaime asks who she will say the father is. Cersei simply responds, "You", and the two embrace in happiness.

Bronn and Jaime discuss Daenerys's forces.

In preparation for the summit, Grey Worm has the Unsullied lined up outside the city walls, watched by a nervous Jaime and Bronn. Jaime wonders how Bronn is unnerved by the idea of soldiers without genitalia, as he's been around enough soldiers to know why they fight, and that the idea of soldiers who fight for no promise of sex is alien to him. As they talk, hordes of Dothraki ride in, a stark contrast to the disciplined Unsullied; but the two ancient enemies are united in cause today. Jaime realizes that if this was an attack, they would lose.
Jaime accompanies Cersei to the parley.
Jaime later accompanies Cersei to the parley with Queen Daenerys and King Jon at the Dragonpit. He spots Brienne among the Northern assembly and the two stare at each other. Jaime quickly looks away from Brienne when he realizes that Cersei has noticed. When Euron Greyjoy attempts to derail the meeting and begins insulting Tyrion, Jaime angrily tells him to sit down. As the parley continues, proof of the Army of the Dead is shown, and Daenerys tells her story of how she saw them. Jaime asks her of the enemy numbers and he is shocked when she tells him of their overwhelming numerical superiority at around at least 100,000. When Cersei leaves the parley in outrage due to Jon's public pledge of loyalty to Daenerys, Brienne urges Jaime to convince Cersei to help. After trying and failing to do so, Jaime later wishes Tyrion luck when he arrives to do the same.

Cersei informs Jaime of her plot.
After Cersei relents, Jaime wastes no time assembling the commanders of the Lannister army in preparation for the march North. He is outraged when Cersei interrupts this meeting and reveals she lied about aiding the North in the war against the dead. Jaime angrily protests that the undead are a threat to every living thing, but Cersei dismisses his concerns, preferring to let Jon and Daenerys exhaust themselves against the Night King, then have her forces deal with whoever emerges victorious from that conflict, boasting that Euron Greyjoy will soon ferry the Golden Company to Westeros in order to secure the Lannister position. Jaime is beside himself with fury that Cersei and Euron plotted this behind his back, only to be left reeling when Cersei accuses him of plotting with Tyrion to advance the cause of their enemies.

Jaime argues with Cersei after she reveals her intentions to betray the Starks and Targaryens.
An incredulous Jaime argues that either way someone is going to win the war in the North, and either the Army of the Dead will march in full force to claim the rest of Westeros or the victorious Targaryen/Northern alliance will seek retribution for Cersei's betrayal. After his protests fall on deaf ears, Jaime declares that he intends to travel North to honor his pledge. As he turns to leave, Ser Gregor blocks his path, causing Jaime to wonder if Cersei is actually going to have him executed. When Jaime uses Cersei's own words to remind her that their father and all their family members are dead (Tyrion having been disinherited), she assures him there is "one more yet to come."

Jaime becomes disgusted by Cersei's will to do anything to keep herself in power. Nodding to Clegane, he tells his sister to give the order.

Jaime abandons Cersei to honor his pledge to the North.
After a moment's hesitation, she nods and Clegane draws his sword. However, since Cersei doesn't actually speak the words, a thoroughly disgusted Jaime calls her bluff. He storms out, leaving a saddened Cersei behind him. He abandons his Lannister armor for simpler garb and departs King's Landing alone. On the ride north, he pulls a riding glove over his golden hand and notices that it has begun to snow, indicating that winter has finally come to King's Landing.

Season 8
Jaime arrives at Winterfell, realizing he is staring at a grown Bran.
Jaime makes the long journey from King's Landing north to Winterfell. After hitching his horse near the castle, he removes the hood of his cloak to look around and sees a young man in a wheelchair staring at him, placid and emotionless, but with a knowing glare. It only takes a moment for him to realize it is Bran Stark (whom he has not seen since he threw him from the tower window). Jaime stares back in shock.

Jaime knights Brienne.
He is taken to Daenerys, where he reveals to everyone present that Cersei was lying about sending her army to assist against the dead. After Brienne vouches for him, he is spared and allowed to fight in the Great War. He later apologizes to Bran who doesn't hold any anger towards him. During a drinking game before fighting the undead, Jaime knights Brienne after she insists that a woman can't be knighted. Jaime assists the Stark and Targaryen forces in fending off the wights during the Battle of Winterfell. Jaime and other survivors are forced to retreat into Winterfell, before the dead are exterminated due to the death of the Night King.

Jaime visits Brienne's chambers during the celebrations.
After the living are victorious, he celebrates along with others and has an intimate moment with Brienne. Bronn, who has been sent by Cersei to kill both her brothers is reluctant as he thinks Daenerys still has a good chance of winning. He tells them that he's been promised Riverrun as a reward, Tyrion in return promises him Highgarden in exchange for sparing their lives, though Jaime protests that he is a cutthroat. Bronn in turn reminds him his own ancestors were cutthroats and agrees to spare them in exchange for being made the Lord of Highgarden after the war.

Brienne begs Jaime to stay.
Learning of the Iron Fleet ambushing the Targaryen fleet later, he is horrified of what fate awaits Cersei if she loses and decides to head back despite Brienne begging him not to. Jaime's plan to sneak into King's Landing fails after being discovered by the besieging forces, though Tyrion helps him escape, so he can convince Cersei to have her forces surrender and flee to Pentos for the sake of their baby. Disguised as a refugee, he is able to slip into the city. He is forced to fight Euron while sneaking into the Red Keep and is able to slay him, though being gravely wounded in the fight. 

Jaime reunites with Cersei.
Jaime finds Cersei in the war room and convinces her to come with him, but they are trapped in the cellars of the Red Keep due to the debris, a result of Drogon's destruction of the city. With no way of escape, Jaime accepts his fate and embraces his distraught sister, who is begging Jaime to find a way to save her and their unborn child. Jaime, however, states nothing else matters except them, and they hug each other while the tunnel collapses. The Lannister twins are killed by the falling debris.

Tyrion unconvers Cersei and Jaime's corpses.
When combing through the ruins of the Red Keep, Tyrion finds his brother's golden hand buried under a pile of rubble. Clearing away the rubble, Tyrion uncovers the bodies of both Cersei and Jaime, discovering that both have died in each other's arms. Brienne then completes his entry in The Book of Brothers, recording all his honorable deeds and building his legacy, writing that he "died protecting his queen."

Jaime's entry in the Book of Brothers is completed.
Personality
At first glance, outsiders perceive Jaime to be arrogant, cocky, cold, dishonorable, extremely dangerous, disdainful, and sarcastic. To a large extent he is arrogant about his own abilities, but not without cause. Jaime Lannister was arguably one of the greatest swordsmen ever, but the loss of his sword-hand warped his abilities, which did much to humble him. Jaime does not mock others over minor insults the way Cersei does, and he can muster up polite behavior, but he is usually very blunt and straightforward. Much like his brother Tyrion, he typically just says what he is thinking, and has no reservations about mocking those he perceives as incompetent. Despite this, there were men that Jaime admired (like Ser Barristan Selmy, for whom he squired) and, underneath this cold and sarcastic attitude, Jaime is a very complicated man.

Tywin Lannister has raised Jaime and Cersei with the principle of ruthlessness as a virtue. Yet even though Jaime Lannister often behaves unapologetically amoral, in his own warped way, Jaime is the only member of the core Lannister family (Tywin and his three children) aside from Tyrion who shows any hint of honor or principles, whilst Tywin claims to see family as his highest priority but simultaneously is willing to have Tyrion, whom he views as an incalculable disgrace, killed, and Cersei herself ironically sees no immorality whatsoever in anything she does. This is largely based on his arrogance and pride at being a member of the Kingsguard. Jaime became extremely disillusioned with ideals of honor and loyalty when he saw firsthand the atrocities committed by the Mad King, how other "honorable" members of the Kingsguard stood by and did nothing while King Aerys had people burned alive for imagined insults, because they felt bound by vows of faith and fealty - in this sense, Jaime is surprisingly similar to Sandor Clegane, since they both have powerful disillusionments about honor and nobility, yet they both frequently avoid unnecessary violence.

A key difference between Cersei and Jaime is that Cersei honestly believes, in her skewed view of the world, that she is "good", Joffrey is a great king, and all of her enemies are "evil" people trying to destroy her and her children. In contrast, Jaime does not maintain any pretense of being a "good" or honorable man, as he has become apathetic to such concerns - this was influenced by him being hated and loathed by everyone because he killed a man who had infamously terrorized the Seven Kingdoms, opening his eyes to how people perceive goodness and honor. However, he still has some respect for the rules of engagement, as he refused to kill Ned Stark when their duel ended abruptly, since Ned was incapacitated by an opportunistic guard rather than Jaime himself - Jaime personally punished that guard seconds after the duel ended. Jaime also was capable of treating his own enemies rather respectfully, telling Ned Stark that his father and brother didn't deserve to die the way Aerys killed them, and saved Olenna Tyrell from a crueler fate that Cersei would have inevitably given her, by allowing her to die painlessly.

Jaime was never politically ambitious, much to Cersei's annoyance, and often turns down her frequent urgings that he should try to become Hand of the King, stating that the days are too long and their lives are too short. Political maneuvering is not his way, and he sees himself foremost as a soldier who when confronted with a problem takes out his sword and cuts its head off. Up until the day his hand was cut off, he had immersed himself in combat so much that it is his sole value, and when he does lose his hand, his sword hand, he loses the will to live because, thus far, he has only ever had to decapitate a problem so as not to face it again, but now he cannot wield a sword the same way ever again - he laments that he was that hand. Brienne of Tarth is quick to tirade to him about him having a small taste of a world where people have their good things ripped from their possession, and after that one small taste he gives up - she mistakes him for a coward at this point. Indeed, Jaime's lack of political thinking leads to him heatedly suggesting that either he or someone else execute the High Sparrow and his followers for manipulating Tommen - at the time, he did not quite see the long term ramifications of such an act because he was angry at the possibility of losing his only surviving child.

After losing his hand and confessing the real reason he killed Aerys to Brienne of Tarth, Jaime begins to redevelop a sense of personal honor once again as he reevaluates his past and future. In no small part to Brienne's influence, Jaime begins to see his father for who he really is and begins to wonder if there are ideals worth fighting for. To this end, he outfits Brienne with new armor and even gifts her the Valyrian steel sword reforged from Ice so that Brienne can fulfill her oath to Catelyn Stark. Jaime himself is more mindful of the promises he makes, and eventually tries offering his solemn oath in certain circumstances, treated with understandable skepticism by the likes of Edmure Tully. Jaime's new outlook develops to the point where he is disgusted with Cersei for stabbing Daenerys's faction in the back, and announces his intention to keep his own promises (although the undead horror bearing down on the Seven Kingdoms clearly has something to do with it).

Jaime is the only member of Tyrion's immediate family who ever treated him with respect or kindness. In fact, he admires Tyrion's intellect and his ability to tell off those who insult him. Jaime never approved of Tywin and Cersei's long history of abuse towards Tyrion, and has always treated him like a brother, the only adult of Tyrion's immediate family to recognize how irrational it was to blame him for their mother's death in childbirth. Indeed, Jaime is the only member of the core Lannister family who has a reasonably good relationship with all of the others. Among the three siblings, Cersei and Tyrion can't stand each other, but they both like Jaime (both Cersei and Tyrion have acknowledged the only reason they haven't gone out of their way to seriously harm or kill each other is because Jaime would never forgive them if they did). However, in recent times, Jaime's good relationship with Tyrion was tarnished with the death of their father, and Jaime said he would kill Tyrion the next time they meet (though it is unclear if he really meant it). His relationship with Cersei has also deteriorated in the aftermath of Tywin's death since it was Jaime who set Tyrion free and inadvertently allowed him to kill their father. Over time, however, and especially after learning that it was Olenna who killed Joffrey, Jaime comes to accept that Tyrion effectively murdered Tywin out of self-defense, a man bound and determined to execute his son; when they meet again in King's Landing, Jaime is initially hostile towards Tyrion, but deep down understands his motives and listens to him, and by the time of the parley in the Dragonpit, Jaime treats Tyrion with the same respect as before, indicating that he has at least partially forgiven his brother.  Over time it becomes clear that Jaime has fully forgiven his brother and shows him the same amount of love and respect as before. This can be seen in the brother's final goodbye where Tyrion tells his brother how much he has meant to him, bringing Jaime to tears as he embraces his little brother one last time.

Tywin was a stern man feared and resented by all of his children, ignoring Cersei for her gender and scorning Tyrion for both his stature and 'killing' his wife in childbirth. However, Jaime is on reasonably good terms with Tywin - not so much that he is "proud" of Jaime so much as he has the "least shame" for him compared to his brother and sister. Even so, Tywin is upset that Jaime willingly joined the Kingsguard, as while it is considered the highest honor for a knight, its members give up the rights to marry or inherit lands, meaning that Jaime cannot be Tywin's heir. Jaime wasn't in a position to act as a father to his biological children with Cersei, though he is generally supportive of Tommen and Myrcella. However, in sharp contrast with Cersei, Jaime isn't particularly fond of Joffrey, nor will he defend his actions the way Cersei does. He shows obvious joy when Myrcella reveals her knowledge that Jaime is her father and is happy about it, and embraces her, since this is the first time he has ever been able to show his feelings as a father to his children. He is equally saddened when Myrcella dies in his arms moments later. He also becomes enraged when the High Sparrow brainwashes his only son, and he contemplates a plan to bloodily finish the High Sparrow's schemes, even though sound judgment states that this plan wouldn't work.

Jaime's attitude towards violence is also complex: he threw Bran Stark out a tower window to kill him, but later saved Brienne twice (from being raped, then fed to a bear) from Locke's soldiers. The difference seems to be that after witnessing the depravity of the Mad King, needless violence and brutality deeply offend Jaime, though if he decides that violence and murder are absolutely necessary he will ruthlessly carry it out himself. He threw Bran out of a window because had the boy reported that he saw the incest between Jaime and his sister, Cersei, the woman he loved, then all of their children would be executed, so he felt he had no choice. However, he was dreadfully sorry for crippling the boy and was amazed to learn that Bran was not angry at him. Jaime killed his defenseless cousin Alton Lannister in order to orchestrate an escape from Robb Stark's camp, but he deeply regretted it afterwards, subtly hinting at it to Tyrion and then outright confessing to the High Sparrow about it, showing that he has a greater conscience than he is given credit for. This sets him apart from Cersei, who destroyed the Sept of Baelor and everyone inside (including their uncle and cousin) and around it, and proved unapologetic about what she had done. Jaime also was capable of reproach for the mistakes he made and their consequences, unlike Cersei: he felt guilt for freeing Tyrion because it led to the death of his father, whereas Cersei is blind to her own mistakes, which led to the deaths of her children. The upshot of this is that Jaime has no delusions about his own conscience. He is certainly ruthless when he needs to be, but unlike Cersei or Joffrey he does not act with cruelty for his own enjoyment. Quite the opposite, in fact: the very murder of Aerys that gained Jaime his negative reputation was actually an act of prevention against a potential genocide that would have engulfed all of King's Landing.

Although Jaime was a highly skilled warrior, he has never distinguished himself as a battle commander. He has won a couple of battles (Battle of the Golden Tooth and the Sack of Highgarden), and resolved the Second Siege of Riverrun almost without casualties; on the other hand, he was defeated in two major battles - Battle of the Whispering Wood and Battle of the Goldroad, in both cases his troops suffered heavy casualties, simply because he neglected basic precautions (placing sentries and sending scouts). Jaime has partly learned from his mistakes: remembering how Robb tricked him by leaving a small decoy force to be overwhelmed while the rest of the army moved to attack more important targets, Jaime allowed the Unsullied to take Casterly Rock (after having emptied its larders) while taking most of the Lannisters' forces south to storm Highgarden; he failed, however, to learn from the same battle the importance of precautions, and that led to his defeat at the Battle of the Goldroad. Regardless, Jaime quickly recognized that the only way he could turn the tide was by killing the enemy commander, even risking his own life for the sake of a chance to kill Daenerys; this demonstrates him to be a man of courage as well as military skill. 

Jaime seems to care about those beneath him, refusing to flog stragglers after the Sack of Highgarden, refusing to leave his men at the Battle of the Goldroad, and lamenting at how easily the Dothraki army broke his own army. Not only is Jaime a prodigal leader, but he has a good amount of common sense, as evidenced by his decision to ride north to combat the threat that the White Walkers posed to Westeros, and his utter incredulity at Cersei's refusal to contribute.

One defining trait of Jaime is his lack of fear of death; he once told Catelyn "the dark is coming for all of us" ("Fire and Blood"). Even when facing a nearly-certain and extremely agonizing death, he shows very little or no fear at all (like when Robb threatened to have Grey Wind kill him, or when he charged at Daenerys during the Battle of the Goldroad and was nearly burnt by Drogon). During his final moments, Jaime peacefully accepted death and used his final moments to comfort his distraught sister.

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Jaime Lannister is described as extremely handsome with bright green eyes and hair like spun gold. The books do not mention him suffering from dyslexia. He is a prodigious warrior.

Jaime becomes a POV character in the third novel. In the first two novels, his actions are witnessed and interpreted from the POV of other characters, mainly Eddard and Catelyn.

At the age of eleven, Jaime was sent to Crakehall, and served as a squire for old Lord Sumner Crakehall for four years (Jaime never served as a squire for Barristan Selmy). While on an errand for Crakehall, Jaime visited Riverrun and at dinner every night Hoster Tully seated him next to his daughter Lysa; Lords Tywin and Hoster were in talks to marry them. However, Jaime was more interested in talking to her famous uncle, Ser Brynden Tully, a hero of his, and hearing of his exploits in the War of the Ninepenny Kings.

Two years later, while still a squire, Jaime won his first tourney melee. When he was fifteen, he and his master accompanied Ser Arthur Dayne and Ser Barristan Selmy in their campaign against the Kingswood Brotherhood. Jaime fought bravely against the Smiling Knight, although was not the one to kill him, and saved the life of Lord Crakehall from another of the outlaws. As a reward, Jaime was knighted by Arthur Dayne on the battlefield.

A Kingsguard berth became vacant with the death of Ser Harland Grandison. With Jaime's approval, Cersei schemed to have him chosen, to prevent his proposed marriage to Lysa Tully, and so they could be in the capital together. Jaime was duly appointed to the Kingsguard by King Aerys II Targaryen. At fifteen, he was the youngest Kingsguard member in history. He served alongside such great and vaunted warriors as Lord Commander Gerold Hightower, Barristan Selmy and Ser Arthur Dayne, the legendary Sword of the Morning. Jaime's appointment extremely infuriated his father, as the Kingsguard take vows to serve for life, never marry, and give up the right to hold lands and titles. This meant Jaime was no longer his heir, the honor of which instead fell to Tywin's misshapen and hated youngest son, Tyrion, whose dwarfism made him unfit in his father's eyes to inherit Casterly Rock. It was the final straw in a long series of slights made against Tywin by the King. Soon afterwards he resigned as Hand of the King and returned to Casterly Rock, taking Cersei with him, thus unwittingly foiling her and Jaime's plan.

Very soon, Jaime realized - at the same day he became a member of the Kingsguard - that his appointment to the Kingsguard was not meant to honor him but to spite his father, whom Aerys was insanely jealous of, to deprive him of his heir and use him as a hostage for Tywin's good behavior, which greatly soured the honor; Aerys wouldn't even let Jaime to savor the day, but immediately ordered him to return to the capital and guard the queen and Viserys. Jaime rapidly became disillusioned with his new position, as he was forced to watch the various atrocities Aerys committed, forced by his vow to stand by and do nothing.

At the climax of Robert's Rebellion, when the Lannister armies stormed King's Landing, Aerys insisted - quite ironically, as Jaime muses many years afterwards - that Jaime stayed and guarded him, to make certain that Tywin would not act against him. Jaime protested, pleading Rhaegar to let Darry or Selmy guard the king, but Rhaegar refused to deprive his father of "that crutch" in such hour. Jaime was angered to be referred as "a crutch", but obeyed.
