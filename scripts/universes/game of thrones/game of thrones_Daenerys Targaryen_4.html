<html><p>Daenerys begins to wear more white as Seasons 4 and 5 progress. Clapton claims the white signifies her mental removal from some of the scenes that she has to be in, such as the fighting pit. It was chaotic and bloody, and she was supposed to be purity in the middle of it all. Therefore was visually removing herself from the things that she disagreed with. Overall, it was how she saw herself. She also plays up her connection to the dragons, with some of her dresses featuring quilting to give the impression of scales, and, since she can now have jewelry made, necklaces and rings in the shape of dragons. Clapton also noted that no matter what color she is wearing, Daenerys always wears Dothraki riding breeches underneath, as experience has taught her that she needs to be prepared for a quick getaway.

Daenerys wears Dothraki clothing again for much of Season 6, but after returning to and securing Meereen, she retains her previous style but wears black instead of white. Black and red are the colors of House Targaryen. Daenerys has rarely worn her House colors since her journey began, so her wearing black now is the ultimate expression of her acceptance of her identity as a Targaryen conqueror and the rightful queen of Westeros.

In Season 7, Daenerys starts off by wearing all black, strong-shouldered gowns. This new style is used to establish her presence and announce her power in Westeros. Clapton states the silhouette of strong shoulders also mirrors that of her brother Viserys. However, it simultaneously represents a dragon with spread wings. Upon her arrival at Dragonstone, her outfit is an altered version of her Season 6 finale dress, however this time there is a collar set over it, and overall includes more elaborate and symbolic design, such as the scaling and hint of red. Throughout the season she also wears a dragon chain across her torso which replaces a crown since she is not a queen yet. At one point, she also has a red sash covered in scales and sometimes has fur piping that is indicative of Westeros' colder climate. When saving Jon Snow, Daenerys wears an outfit completely different from her previous ones; a white, striped fur coat to symbolize her selfless act of rescue, rather than an act of acquiring more power. 

Daenerys arrives in Winterfell at the beginning of Season 8 wearing a very similar gown to that where she rescued Jon, however this time it has a red base instead of grey, which ultimately mixes Targaryen and Northern styles, and a split in the skirt, which suits for riding a horse. Also, at one point she has one-sided shoulder fur, which was mainly added because of Daenerys wanting the Northerner's acceptance but was also incorporated as Daenerys was trying to match Jon's silhouette.  However, since it is only draped on one shoulder, she is only partly matching his silhouette, therefore, it is possible that the costumes are hinting Daenerys and Jon have a visual harmony that only works from one angle. Also, the juxtaposition between Jon's dark costume and Daenerys' light costume alludes to both their differences. Throughout the season, her costumes vary by how she feels. For example, whenever she feels alienated or threatened, she reasserts her authority by wearing more of her House colors or the strong-shoulders. Eventually, during the Battle of King's Landing, she wears a bluish, scale-embossed dress with a visible dragon chain, which was (arguably) purposefully hidden behind her hair to hide her conquerer side, accompanied by a red sash, which was also fastened beneath her shoulder instead of above her shoulder, therefore appearing more hidden. So when she attacks the city, she appears a formidable conquerer, however, the dress is unique and symbolizes that she had different intentions. 

Fireproof?
In the books, Daenerys does not appear to be "fireproof." Martin has stated that her ability to survive Drogo's funeral pyre was a special circumstance, a blood magic ritual involving "fire and blood" - only life can pay for a life, so burning Mirri Maz Duur in the funeral pyre was enough to awaken the life in the dormant dragon eggs. Under normal circumstances, Daenerys is no more immune to fire than any other human. Her brother Viserys once claimed in the novels that Targaryens were a race above other men, immune to both fire and illness - this was blatantly wrong, given that multiple Targaryens in the past are well-known for having burned to death, and many have succumbed to common illnesses over the years (including greyscale). Viserys's comment just highlights how little he knew about Targaryen history (or anything else). It does appear that Targaryens seem to have a slightly higher heat tolerance than average, though: at Illyrio's mansion Daenerys takes a bath in near-scalding hot water, despite the protests of her maidservant, but in the novels, she thinks to herself how pleasant the heat feels (this also happened in the first episode of the TV series). Still, this is nothing outside the normal human range - i.e. any more than centuries of history have shaped the Dornish to be more comfortable in the dry desert heat, or shaped the wildlings to be more accustomed to a cold climate. In fact, when Daenerys rides Drogon out of the Great Pit of Meereen, she is stated to have burns and blisters on her hands from the flames.

The series, however, appears to suggest that Daenerys might, in fact, have some actual fireproofing ability. In addition to the bath scene in "Winter Is Coming", Daenerys doesn't notice the heat from the brazier in "A Golden Crown", and notably, her hands are unburnt, while Irri's are blistered immediately after picking up the egg. It could be argued that she displayed this ability again in "Valar Morghulis", when she has her dragons burn down the House of the Undying, although it's possible that the dragons managed to just aim the fire past Daenerys at Pyat Pree (notice her clothes are intact after this incident). Most glaring, however, is Daenerys's stunt at the Temple of the dosh khaleen, from which she emerges again unburnt. In the "Inside the Episode" feature for "Book of the Stranger", Weiss and Benioff imply that Daenerys does indeed have this ability in some fashion, although she only decided to exploit it after Jorah and Daario showed up.

It should be pointed out that even if Daenerys is fireproof in the series, there is no indication that all Targaryens are, as most fire-related deaths the House has suffered are mentioned as being similar to those in the books. This adds another layer to Viserys's death: Daenerys was realizing that heat and fire didn't affect her like they did most people, and (correctly) suspected that Viserys lacked this resistance.

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Daenerys was born on the Targaryen island refuge of Dragonstone eight months after her father's death. Her mother died giving birth to her, and a great storm raged at the moment of her birth, destroying what was left of the Targaryen fleet anchored at Dragonstone, giving rise to the nickname "Stormborn." The infant Daenerys and her brother Viserys were spirited into exile across the Narrow Sea by Ser Willem Darry, a loyal retainer of their family, before the castle garrison could hand them over to Robert Baratheon.

In the books, Daenerys is the great-granddaughter of Aegon V, not his granddaughter. The showrunners truncated the Targaryen family line in order to simplify her relationship to Aemon Targaryen. They accomplished this by eliminating the reign of Jaehaerys II and making Aerys II Targaryen the son of Aegon V Targaryen instead of his grandson.

The books go into a little more detail about Daenerys's early life in the Free Cities. Initially, Daenerys lived with Ser Willem and Viserys in Braavos, in a house with a big red door. Ser Willem was old and bedridden and yelled at the servants, but was very kind to Daenerys. After several years, Ser Willem died and the servants drove the Targaryen children from the house, taking what money they had. Daenerys was old enough to remember living in this house and has recurrent dreams about her last sight of the big red door, which came to symbolize the childhood she never had. The house in Braavos was the closest thing to a home Daenerys ever had, but even she never considered herself to be truly home here. Afterward, the Targaryen children bounced around between different patrons, each enjoying having the Targaryen exiles as guests but abandoning them when the novelty wore off. Some briefly entertained the idea of helping them retake the Iron Throne, but as the years passed and Robert Baratheon's rule appeared more and more secure, the number of patrons dwindled and their lives grew meaner. Daenerys grew up living on the sufferance of others, frequently turned out on the street with little warning when their patrons lost interest in them. Viserys was reduced to pathetically begging for support throughout the Free Cities as they moved from patron to patron. In the process, they traveled from Braavos to Myr, then to Tyrosh, then to Qohor, then to Volantis, then to Lys, and ultimately to Pentos (each of the Free Cities except Norvos and Lorath). They never lived in one place for more than a few months, and their stay in Pentos with Illyrio was actually the longest time they had lived in one place since Braavos (for six months in the books, but stated to be over a year in the TV series).

Daenerys does not appear to have a particular religious affiliation in the books. She grew up in the Free Cities, which have a more diverse religious composition than Westeros, so she has been exposed to several different religions but finds them to be confusing. Her final chapter in the third novel (A Storm of Swords - Daenerys VI) begins with an inner narration from her POV in which she ponders aspects of different religions. The Targaryens converted to the Faith of the Seven when Aegon the Conqueror invaded Westeros three hundred years ago, and the ancient Valyrian religion is long extinct. Daenerys's brother Viserys apparently made some effort to explain the basic principles of the Faith of the Seven to her, considering that he hoped they would one day rule again over the Seven Kingdoms, where it is the dominant religion - but Daenerys thinks that the concept of a single god who is split into seven facets is confusing. She is also aware of the Lord of Light religion, given that it is the most popular religion in the Free Cities, but she thinks that its belief in a constant violent struggle between R'hllor and the Great Other to be too violent. Daenerys, therefore, has no particularly strong religious affiliations but is fairly open-minded to the religions of new peoples she meets in Essos. While not outright "converting" to the Great Stallion religion of the Dothraki, after marrying Drogo out of love for her husband's god she finds herself praying to the great horse in the sky at times, even after Drogo's death. Still, Daenerys isn't particularly sure what her personal beliefs are. The TV series doesn't spend much time on this question either: it is only in Season 7 that Daenerys bluntly says that she has faith only in herself and not in any god. The World of Ice & Fire suggests that this was a common attitude amongst the Dragonlords of Old Valyria.

Daenerys is thirteen years old when the events of the novels begin. Initially, she is somewhat quiet and reticent, and fearful of her brother's infamous rages, but also curious about life in the Seven Kingdoms and eager to learn more of life there. She has a kind and generous spirit. This spirit slowly begins to harden after her brother's death and after surviving her first assassination attempt.

Unbeknownst to Daenerys, her nephew Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell), the son of Rhaegar and Elia, is alive, as revealed in A Dance with Dragons. They were supposed to meet in Volantis, but Daenerys has decided to remain in Meereen, and Aegon cannot reach her due to the siege. Aegon is initially certain that Daenerys will marry him and give him her armies and dragons for the purpose of conquering Westeros; in contrast to Jon's show character, Aegon does not see anything wrong about marrying his aunt. Tyrion pours cold water on the overconfident youth's hopes, pointing out that his aunt is not some timid little girl who does whatever she is told, but a powerful queen, who has crossed deserts, survived assassins, rallied armies and conquered cities. Tyrion comments that if Aegon appears before her like that (even with the Golden Company), he'll look like a beggar; he advises Aegon to travel to Westeros instead, raise his banners, rally supporters, and then Daenerys will come and meet him as equals. Aegon follows Tyrion's advice; so far, Daenerys has not heard of him. It has yet to be seen how she will react when she finds out she has a living family relative, whose claim to the Iron Throne is stronger than hers.

Daenerys fits the prophecies about "the prince that was promised" and about Azor Ahai (which may refer to the same person) as well:

According to Melisandre, "When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone." Daenerys was born on Dragonstone, which is a volcanic island - a place of "smoke and salt"; she has hatched fossilized dragon eggs into live dragons, in a miraculous ritual under the red comet at the pyre of her late husband Drogo.
Apparently, Melisandre is unaware of the above, since she keeps stating Stannis is Azor Ahai (although Stannis was born on Storm's End and has not woken any stone dragons).

Maester Aemon explains that the word "prince" in High Valyrian is gender-neutral. He claims that Daenerys is the prince that was promised; the dragons prove that.
