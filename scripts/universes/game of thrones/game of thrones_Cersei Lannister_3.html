<html><p>Tywin does plan to find a new husband for Cersei, though not Loras Tyrell, who has been made a Kingsguard after the battle of the Blackwater. Willas Tyrell, Mace's eldest son and heir (who does not appear in the TV series), is Tywin's first choice. However, Olenna Tyrell vetoes the match in revenge for the Lannisters foiling her plot to marry Sansa to Willas, claiming that Cersei is "too old and too used" for her precious grandson. Prince Oberyn Martell and Balon Greyjoy are also suggested as a match. Cersei never threatens her father with revealing Tommen's true parentage if she is forced to re-marry; she does object, exclaiming that she is not a brood mare, but Tywin firmly tells her that she will marry and breed in order to refute the rumor Stannis spread about her incest (which she did). Grudgingly, Cersei asks for a few days to consider that. As things turn to be, Tywin dies before Cersei is forced to marry anyone.

With her father dead, Cersei once more rules the Seven Kingdoms as Queen Regent. She grows increasingly paranoid and vindictive, drinks heavily and endlessly schemes to deal with her enemies, real and imagined (Margaery, Jon Snow, Bronn, Trystane Martell, etc.). All of Cersei's schemes, with no exception, somehow go wrong - foiled, backfire or never come to fruition; even those that initially succeed - turn to be too costly.

During her reign, Cersei becomes alcoholic, and takes lovers of both genders, among them Osney Kettleblack and Lady Taena Merryweather, both characters of questionable loyalty. Jaime, who has been growing more and more distant from Cersei, is disgusted by her behavior; he finds it ironic that she has adopted the same negative habits she hated so much about Robert. 

Cersei's paranoia increases rapidly, so much that she interprets every statement, causal comment or even a smile as a plot against her. For instance: Kevan advises her to appoint either Randyll Tarly or Mathis Rowan as Tommen's Hand, since they are able and loyal; however, since both are the Tyrells' bannermen, Cersei hastily concludes that her uncle is a traitor, bought by the Tyrells to act against her - which is a totally wrong conclusion.

Cersei is annoyed at the Tyrells due to their nonstop demands, among them to wed Margaery to Tommen so soon after Joffrey's death. As time passes, Cersei's annoyance gradually turns into mistrust, and then to paranoia: she becomes convinced that the Tyrells, Margaery in particular, are plotting against her, have conspired with Tyrion to kill Joffrey and maybe her father too (she does not suspect Littlefinger at all). Her suspicions are fueled when a gold Highgarden coin is found in the cell of a jailer named Rugen (in fact, Varys in disguise), who disappeared the night Tyrion escaped; that makes her suspect the Tyrells - not Jaime - helped Tyrion escape by bribing the guards, and confirms her former suspicions about them. She has nightmares about Tyrion and thinks he is still hiding in the walls of the Red Keep, planning to kill her and her children. Until now, her obsessive hatred for Tyrion has effectively blinded her to the presence of her true enemies, believing that anything and everything that happens to her family was somehow Tyrion's doing (including the attempt of Gerold "Darkstar" Dayne to kill Myrcella â€“ the end result of a plot instigated by a rogue member of House Martell who was actually trying to help Myrcella), and this obsession only grows after Tyrion kills Tywin.

Cersei soon makes a number of rash and ill-judged decisions. She fills the small council with her own cronies, picked for their loyalty to her rather than their competence, disregarding Tywin's previous arrangements and advice from Jaime and others. Despite the Crown's heavy debts, she orders the construction of a new royal fleet (rather than rely on the fleet of Paxter Redwyne, a bannerman of Mace Tyrell, or make an alliance with the Greyjoys to replace the few ships that survived the Battle of the Blackwater) and puts it under the command of Aurane Waters, a bastard sellsail of questionable loyalty and experience, who later steals the entire fleet. She refuses to honor the Crown's debt to the Iron Bank of Braavos and flippantly brushes off its representatives when they demand an explanation. In retaliation, the Iron Bank begins calling in loans all over Westeros, causing economic chaos, and eventually sends a representative to Stannis Baratheon to offer to finance him. In return for cancelling the Crown's debts to the Faith, she allows the Faith Militant to be re-established, oblivious to the strife they had caused the Targaryens centuries earlier. Pycelle, who previously was Cersei's henchman, keeps arguing and objecting to her poor decisions, but his protests fall on deaf ears.

She offers her uncle Kevan the position of Hand of the King, which he agrees, on the condition that he also be named Regent and that Cersei removes herself from King's Landing and, just like Tywin wanted, returns to Casterly Rock and re-marries. Cersei is infuriated and a fierce argument takes place during which she threatens Kevan. As he leaves, Kevan calls her an unfit mother, and hints that he knows Jaime fathered her children. In response, she throws her wine in his face. Out of spite, Cersei then names two Lannister cousins Warden of the West and Castellan of Casterly Rock, respectively, instead of Kevan. She ignores the advice of Kevan and Jaime to appoint a capable and respected man like Randyll Tarly or Mathis Rowan as Hand, choosing instead the weak and compliant Harys Swyft.

Cersei's paranoia also leads to her plotting to have Jon Snow killed, fearing that as Ned Stark's (presumed) last surviving son, he may rally the Night's Watch against the Lannisters; that plot is never realized, though. She also places a bounty on Tyrion, promising a lordship to whoever brings her his head, which leads to the deaths of many dwarfs and even ordinary children on both sides of the Narrow Sea. Cersei refuses to publicly punish anyone who kills an innocent, however, fearing that doing so will discourage other bounty hunters and allow Tyrion to escape.

Cersei's actions alienate Jaime, who wants nothing to do with the increasing brutality and rampant cronyism of her reign, and flatly tells his sister she's seeing enemies where none exist and turning what few allies she has left against her. Watching how Cersei treats Tommen, Jaime - similarly to his father and uncle - thinks she is totally incompetent as a mother and fears she will corrupt their son into another Joffrey. Jaime is also haunted by Tyrion's revelation that Cersei has been cheating on him with Lancel Lannister and Osmund Kettleblack, amongst others. Some time later, Lancel tells Jaime the truth about his affair with Cersei and his part in Robert's death, thus confirming Tyrion's words; moreover, Jaime realizes that Cersei is responsible not only for Robert's murder, but also for the murder of the previous High Septon, what increases the deep loathing he already feels toward her.

In the books, after Tywin dies, Cersei becomes the new head of House Lannister, but she appoints lesser cousins to other titles Tywin held: Daven Lannister (son of Stafford Lannister) is made the new Warden of the West, and even more distant cousin Damion Lannister is named castellan of Casterly Rock (Cersei is Lady of the castle, but she isn't there to rule it directly). No mention was made in the corresponding Season 5 of the TV series about exactly who holds the titles that Tywin used to hold - possibly implying that Cersei is the new Wardeness, but this awaits clarification.

Instead of having Loras Tyrell arrested by the Faith on charges of homosexuality, Cersei sends him to capture Dragonstone, hoping he will die in the attempt due to his rashness; he is fatally injured but somehow clings to life by the point the books reached. Cersei also orders her lover Osney Kettleblack to seduce Margaery, in a scheme to bring about Margaery's downfall. When he fails to do so, Cersei compiles a long, dubious, list of individuals Margaery has supposedly slept with; she tortures the Blue Bard, a young singer in service with House Tyrell, into "confessing", and has Kettleblack sent to the High Septon to confess. Margaery is arrested, but the plot backfires when the High Septon grows suspicious of Kettleblack's confession and has him tortured. Kettleblack then admits the truth: that he never touched Margaery but he has been sleeping with Cersei, and that he killed the previous High Septon on her orders.

Cersei's stupidity is underscored by the fact that even the unworthy people she has recently appointed to the small council - who mainly act as sycophants - are aware of the dangerous applications of Margaery's arrest. They express their concern that, due to Margaery's popularity and her family's military strength, the smallfolk will riot and Mace will storm King's Landing. Cersei, smug about her "victory", is not worried, but agrees that some precautions must be taken. Of course, she could have figured the consequences of her poorly developed schemes in advance, had she thought it over.

Cersei is arrested by the High Sparrow on charges of high treason, fornication, incest, regicide, deicide and adultery. She confesses only the lesser charges - sleeping with Lancel and others, claiming she did that only after Robert's death (namely that she's guilty of fornication, but not of adultery); she denies all the other charges and demands a trial by combat, though she soon realizes that her choices for a champion are limited, since as the acting Queen, her champion must be a Kingsguard. She writes to Jaime, pleading for help; Jaime, who has grown to hate Cersei and even considers killing her, ignores her letter, since he knows she's guilty of all the crimes she is charged with. She's allowed to return to the Red Keep by walking naked through the streets of King's Landing, while being jeered by the crowd. Once she arrives, she's met by Qyburn, who introduces her to Ser Robert Strong (a re-animated Gregor Clegane), the newest member of the Kingsguard who will serve as her champion.

Following the walk of atonement - in sharp contrast to the show - Cersei is stripped of all power and authority, including her seat at the small council; all her henchmen are either deposed, imprisoned or flee away; she's practically confined to her chambers rather than the Red Keep at large, and is not allowed to walk around with her new bodyguard and intimidate people; all her guards are replaced by Kevan's men; her former ladies-in-waiting are replaced by a septa and three novices who watch her all the time, selected by the High Septon, and as an additional precaution - the novices are to be replaced every week, lest Cersei corrupts them; she cannot receive any visitors, including Tommen, without Kevan's permission; whatever schemes she has in mind, she cannot realize them. Qyburn is the only one who remains loyal to her. Kevan intends to return her to Casterly Rock after the trial (if she's not executed) and see that she remains there, unable to take part both in the governance of the realm and in Tommen's education, while he and the new appointed small council members take steps to repair the damages she caused.

According to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, "Cersei Lannister" is pronounced "SER-see LAN-iss-ter."

 Jaime is Cersei's twin, and thus the same age as her. Tyrion stated in "The Prince of Winterfell" that Cersei became Queen when she was 19, at the end of Robert's Rebellion, which ended in 280 AC per the prop for The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms. This makes Cersei 37 in Season 1 and 40 in Season 4. In the Season 4 premiere, Jaime is also said to be 40.
