<html><p>Jon later visits Tyrion in his cell and they speak of Daenerys's actions. Tyrion admits he was wrong to betray Varys who turned out right all along about her. Jon struggles with what Daenerys has become and wants to believe the war is done, trying to reason out her actions due to the various traumas she suffered but Tyrion tries to make Jon see the threat Daenerys now is. Tyrion tells him, "I know you love her. I love her too, but not as successfully as you, but I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason." Jon reflects, "Love is the death of duty." Tyrion further says that duty is the death of love. He realizes he's asking Jon to do a terrible thing, but tells him it is also the right thing to save the people as Daenerys is now the biggest threat. Tyrion warns Jon that Daenerys will always view him as a threat to her rulership because he is the true heir to the throne. Jon struggles with what Tyrion is asking of him due to his love for Daenerys. Tyrion reminds Jon of his sisters, expressing his belief that they will not bend the knee to Daenerys. Jon leaves, troubled. 

Tyrion is brought before the Great Council of Westeros.
Jon tries but is unable to dissuade Daenerys from her path of destruction and reluctantly assassinates her, upon which he is imprisoned. Weeks later, Tyrion is tried in the Dragonpit by all the Lords of the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion convinces Grey Worm to let the new King of the Seven Kingdoms punish Jon, after the lords of Westeros oppose the Unsullied's desires to punish him. He then asks the gathering that they should choose the new monarch of the Seven Kingdoms and end the war once and for all. After some rejected ideas, he suggests Bran Stark to be named the new king, because he is the living memory of the world and it is stories that unite people.

Despite concerns that Bran could never sire any children, Tyrion says it is for the better as heirs often don't make good kings. He proposes that all the lords of the Seven Kingdoms choose the new king, which is accepted by all except Sansa. Bran picks Tyrion as his Hand so as to charge him with atoning for his past mistakes in both supporting and committing treason against Bran's predecessor. Grey Worm opposes it initially but relents.

Tyrion tells Jon of his exile.
Later, Tyrion visits Jon and informs him that a compromise has been reached and he is going back to the Night's Watch. Jon accepts this and asks Tyrion if what he did was right. "What we did," Tyrion corrects. Jon says it doesn't feel right. They bid farewell, Tyrion telling Jon they'll see each other again, saying he wants to "go pissing off the Wall again" after serving for a few years as the Hand. Tyrion reforms the small council, now consisting of Bronn, now the Lord of Highgarden, as Master of Coin, Davos as Master of Ships, Sam as Grand Maester and Brienne as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. He also seems to have retrieved the silver hand brooch that was gifted to him by Daenerys, indicating that despite having ended their relationship on bad terms, he still believed in who she used to be and the wheel she wanted to break.  

Tyrion discusses the vacant positions in the reformed small council.
King Bran however notices the position of Masters of War, Laws and Whisperers are vacant, which Tyrion assures will be filled before the king goes away to find Drogon. They then move on to their primary tasks concerning the rehabilitation of King's Landing, providing clean water, food to civilians, the reconstruction of the royal fleet and the ports. As Bronn discusses using some of the Crown's gold to rebuild the city's brothels, which is met with opposition, Tyrion relates how he once brought 'a honeycomb and a jackass into a brothel.'

As the last surviving child of Tywin Lannister, Tyrion has finally become Lord of Casterly Rock, the title his father has been trying to deny him of for so many years.

Personality
Tyrion is a highly intelligent man who recognized from an early age that his mind was his greatest weapon, due to being born a member of House Lannister with the expectation of upholding his family's noble name, yet lacking the physical attributes possessed by his older siblings. Thus, he has committed himself to possessing a sharp intellect in order to help make up for his dwarfism, and he is frequently able to use his superior intellect to get the better of those who initially look down upon him or weasel his way out of tight situations, though he is not above resorting to using his family name and enormous fortune to bolster his position. He has also shown himself to possess a keen mind for strategy, as is evidenced in his research into defending against sieges and successfully conducting the defense of King's Landing during the Battle of the Blackwater. Tyrion prides himself on his ability to read people as easily as he does books, and he has on many occasions easily gotten the better of not just Joffrey and Cersei but also experienced players such as Littlefinger and Pycelle.

Despite his harsh treatment at the hands of others over the years, Tyrion has managed to develop a thick skin and is able to brush off others' japes about his short stature (except when coming from his father). Tyrion advised Jon Snow how to handle his own bastard status, which reflects Tyrion's own approach to life: take your impediment in stride and wear it like armor, so it cannot be used to hurt you. Being born a dwarf and subject to ridicule for most of his life, Tyrion has admittedly developed a soft spot for his fellow outcasts and has shown them kindness, such as having a saddle designed for the crippled Bran Stark allowing him to ride. Being physically weak, Tyrion is also upset when the helpless are harmed. He was particularly enraged when Janos Slynt carried out an order to kill a defenseless baby girl, Barra (because she was one of Robert's bastards), and as punishment had him exiled to the Wall. Tyrion is also genuinely loyal to those who treat him with love and respect. He also seems to have a level of honor and dignity that the rest of his family seem to lack; events such as the Red Wedding disgusted him, and he considered them to be crimes (though he did admit that there was a certain level of "cheating" in war that he is comfortable with, the Red Wedding went beyond that). One of his most interesting and enduring friendships is with the eunuch Varys, the Master of Whisperers. Tyrion and Varys connect on several levels: they are both social lepers because of a physical condition that most people treat with distaste, they are both brilliant intellectuals with a dry sense of humor, they both have a compassionate nature but are capable of being ruthless when necessary, and they are both fond of wine. Although Tyrion and Varys were wary of each other at first (mainly due to the extreme reputations they both maintained), they have developed trust over the course of their various adventures.

Tyrion, however, is not without faults. He tends to overindulge in food, drink, and sex in part to self-medicate for the terrible treatment he's suffered most of his life; when overly stressed, upset or uncomfortable, he will quickly find the nearest container of wine or beer and consume most of it. Tyrion can also act viciously if he feels he's been wronged - such as confining Grand Maester Pycelle to the Black Cells for betraying him or, in his darkest hour, killing Shae for testifying against him during his trial and having an affair with his father, and then going on to kill Tywin himself. Because his father and sister treated him like a social leper, Tyrion craves love and acceptance and is genuinely hurt when this is denied him by others. 

He has complex relationships with other members of his family, most of whom resent him and only thinly veil their contempt for his existence. His older sister Cersei blames him for causing the death of their mother and has (as revealed during a conversation with Oberyn) hated Tyrion since his birth. His father, Tywin, shares Cersei's resentment for Tyrion due to the death of his wife while birthing him, as Joanna was the only person Tywin ever loved. Although Tywin recognizes and respects Tyrion's intellect, it does not lessen his prejudice towards his youngest son; by the same token Tyrion fears and admires his father, but hates him for his inflexibility and unwillingness to show any love for his children. Tywin also just thinks it is an embarrassment that Tyrion was born with a physical disability, seeing it as a judgement from the gods meant to humiliate him by his son's mere existence.

Only Tyrion's older brother Jaime maintained a good relationship with Tyrion, admiring him for both his intellect and inability to let his diminished stature drag him down, and he has frequently attempted to come to Tyrion's defense when his other family members treat him maliciously, making Jaime the only member of his immediate family whom Tyrion loves. Tyrion harbors a mutual admiration for Jaime, even naming him as his champion when he demanded a trial by combat while being held prisoner at the Eyrie. However, this cozy relationship ended when Tyrion killed their father, although they reconciled since then. The last time they were together, Tyrion tearfully thanked his brother for being the only Lannister to treat him like a brother, not a monster and that Jaime helped Tyrion survived his childhood.

Despite his poor and mutually hateful relationship with his sister Cersei, Tyrion was noted to have had a very good relationship with at least two of her children; Myrcella and Tommen. This is seen where Mrycella showcased active care, affection, love and worry for Tyrion and when he returned safely back to King's landing, she made sure to happily state that she was glad he survived alongside Tommen. Tyrion himself reciprocates her affection and love and despite his relationship with their mother, truly cared for them. As seen where Tyrion was enraged upon learning of Mrycella's death and angerly argued with Ellaria Sand due to her hand in her death.

After he killed Shae and his father, Tyrion becomes a broken man: he had lost the will to live. Traumatized by killing the woman he loved and losing his lordship, influence and fabulous wealth, he becomes more cynical and pessimistic and was content to just drink himself to death instead of helping Varys to aid Daenerys Targaryen in getting the Iron Throne. Tyrion becomes convinced in the futility of everything, gaining a negative and rather fatalistic outlook on the past and the future, to the point of suicidal, as well gains a lower view for matters he dealt with high esteem and importance beforehand in the past, such as the Great Houses or the bid for the Iron Throne. Even when meeting Daenerys face to face, Tyrion explained that he was still content to die. However, whilst helping with the chaos in Meereen, and keeping Daenerys from becoming like her father in her ruthlessness, he regains his will to live. He also finally finds something to believe in, as he believes in Daenerys. His sense of humor is more muted and cynical than before, however; this may be the result of his no longer being able to rely on his family title for protection and influence, and having to earn his merits with Daenerys on his brains alone.  

Although Tyrion's skills with political maneuvering, administration, and diplomacy are extremely impressive, his record as a military strategist and tactician are more mixed. In this respect, he is similar to his father, although unlike Tywin, Tyrion's lack of skill on the battlefield has more to do with his unwillingness to inflict heavy loss of life on either side. He achieved a successful ambush at the Battle of the Blackwater with his wildfire trap and led his troops personally on a sortie, but this alone was still not enough to win the battle without help from Tywin and the Tyrells; indeed, the massive casualties resulting from the wildfire shook him and (presumably) made him reluctant to use such a devastating weapon again. This, in turn, made him somewhat overly cautious in his strategy to help Daenerys win against Cersei. As a result, most of his battle plans, with the exception of capturing Casterly Rock, failed, leading Daenerys to lose her patience with his strategy and take matters into her own hands. Nonetheless, Tyrion played a valuable role in developing and solidifying the alliance between Daenerys and Jon Snow, the King in the North.  

Tyrion is somewhat of a pacifist in his heart. This is evident, when he several times advised Daenerys not to resort to violence in order to solve problems (though this was also an attempt to make sure she doesn't become like her father). He always desires a less violent approach to matters, only resorting for it when there is no other way.

Quotes
Behind the scenes
George Appleby was a stunt double for Peter Dinklage in the role of Tyrion Lannister.
In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Tyrion is in his mid-twenties when the events of the series begin, whereas in the show his age is not mentioned. However, the age gap between him and his siblings is smaller: in the books, Tyrion was born when Cersei and Jaime were 7, while in the show, they were 4. This was likely to accommodate the actors: Peter Dinklage is four years older than Lena Headey and one year older than Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.

As well as being a dwarf, Tyrion is misshapen and often described as ugly and having eyes of two different colors, one green and one black. He is described as having a huge disproportionate head and an pronounced ungainly waddle when he walks. His hair is lank and very pale, but when he lets his beard grow in it comes in as a mixture of blonde and black hairs. In the beginning of the TV series, actor Peter Dinklage insisted on not having a beard, because he felt that bearded dwarfs are a fantasy stereotype, though he agreed to grow a beard from the fifth season onwards.

Cersei hated Tyrion ever he was born, unjustly blaming him (like their father) of their mother's death, and also due to Maggy's prophecy about the "valonqar"; she hurt him on several occasions. Jaime, on the other hand, always treated Tyrion kindly.

Ever since he was a child, Tyrion has been interested in dragons. He used to dream of riding a dragon, imagining he was some lost Targaryen princeling, or a Valyrian dragonlord. He once asked his uncles Gerion and Tygett for one as a nameday present, and was devastated to hear that the last dragon had died a century ago. He eagerly reads any accounts he can find about dragons, though most of those are idle tales. On the way to Volantis, the sellsword Griff orders Tyrion to set down all he knows of dragonlore; the task is formidable, but Tyrion labors at it diligently. The thought about meeting Daenerys and her dragons makes Tyrion relive his childhood dreams.

Tysha was reported to be the daughter of a crofter rather than a wheelwright (this may have been for the benefit of North American audiences who are less likely to know what a crofter is) and the marriage took place when he was only 13 years old. He bought them a little cottage where they lived as man and wife for their two week marriage, before his father had it annulled. Tywin not only had 50 guards rape her, but then ordered Tyrion to have sex with her as well, giving her a gold piece as a Lannister is worth more.

At the Battle of the Green Fork, Tyrion is not knocked out by his own men. In fact he leads with distinction, holding the line under great adversity. Later when he tells his father that the plan to kill him by putting him in the vanguard (under the command of Ser Gregor Clegane) failed, Tyrion learns that his father had put him there hoping that an inexperienced Tyrion with undisciplined hill tribesmen would break and run to be pursued into a trap by the Stark forces. Tyrion holding the line had ruined the plan. It is a combination of this along with his reading of the situation they face in the war, and the fact that Jaime may not be retrievable, that makes Tywin decide to make use of Tyrion as acting Hand. Tyrion realizes that Tywin is preparing for the worst, that the Starks might well kill Jaime as revenge for Eddard's murder, so he is finally giving Tyrion real power.

When Tyrion relieves Janos Slynt of command of the Gold cloaks, it is Ser Jacelyn Bywater or "Ironhand" who becomes their new commander, not Bronn. It is Varys, not Tyrion, who comes up with the suggestion to send Joffrey some prostitutes to soften his temper, but the results are not shown. Tyrion does not send Littlefinger to Catelyn at Renly's camp with Lord Eddard's bones and an offer for the release of Jaime (though Baelish is sent to treat with the Tyrells after Renly's death). The bones are sent with Cleos Frey (replaced by Alton Lannister in the series) to Riverrun along with unacceptable peace terms and a force of 100 Lannister soldiers, that hide four men Tyrion has sent to break Jaime out, an escape attempt that fails.

Shae is not brought to the Tower of the Hand; instead she is put in a manse that Tyrion can approach by using a secret tunnel from a brothel. As Stannis's troops advance to the city, Tyrion arranges Shae to become Lollys Stokeworth's servant.

The most important of the defenses for the city that Tyrion builds is a huge chain that stretches across the whole of Blackwater Rush, to be raised after Stannis's fleet enters to trap them inside with the wildfire.

In the book's version of the Battle of Blackwater, Tyrion has almost his entire nose cut off by Ser Mandon Moore's sword swipe; the TV series only included the deep scar across his face (which as also present in the books). As Peter Dinklage explained, "I know, for fans of the books, that Tyrion loses his nose in the battle. But it would be next to impossible and very expensive to do that on television, and I would be wearing a green sock [on my nose, to digitally remove it with greenscreen], I think, for the next however many years, which I don't know how that would be on set. But yeah, the digital artist would have a lot of work on their hands. So I think we came up with a really good solution."

In the official blooper reel for Season 4, when "action" is shouted and a stage hand closes the clapperboard right in front of Dinklage's face, he started jokingly pretending that board was held too close and cut his nose off.

In A Storm of Swords, when Joffrey is poisoned, Cersei is quick to blame Tyrion and have him put on a farcical show trial, which leads him to demand a trial by combat. As this occurs around the same time Jaime returns to the capital, Tyrion confers with his uncle Kevan while in custody, and it is Kevan who persuades Tywin to spare Tyrion and send him to the Night's Watch. After Oberyn Martell is killed and Tyrion is sentenced to death, he is freed by Jaime, who goes on to reveal that his marriage to Tysha was actually a proper marriage and he had been forced by Tywin to make it look like it had been staged. Enraged at such a betrayal, Tyrion vows revenge on Jaime, Cersei and Tywin, spitefully but falsely telling Jaime that he killed Joffrey, and it is for this reason that he confronts and kills Shae and then Tywin while he is on the privy (in the television series, he kills Tywin for Shae, which left some fans confused as to why Tyrion would kill his own father for a woman who committed the ultimate betrayal against him and who he himself had just killed). His story ends just after he kills Tywin, and unlike the end of the fourth season, it is left unrevealed if he escaped Westeros or not.

Tyrion does not appear in the fourth book, A Feast for Crows, and his whereabouts are not revealed, though he is mentioned several times, particularly due to Cersei having placed a bounty on his head, and also Cersei's increasing paranoia that Tyrion is still hiding somewhere in the Red Keep, waiting for the right moment to strike and kill her. Tyrion's escape also fuels Cersei's paranoia of House Tyrell: a Tyrell coin is found in the cell of an undergaoler named Rugen (who is actually Varys in disguise), leading Cersei to believe that the Tyrells, particularly Margaery, might have conspired with Tyrion to murder Joffrey and helped him escape by bribing the guards, maybe even conspired to kill Tywin too.

Several innocent dwarfs are killed by bounty hunters who mistake them for Tyrion. Among them are: a pious dwarf that Brienne meets at the Riverlands; a Tyroshi juggler; Oppo (aka Groat), one of the two dwarfs who performed at Joffrey's wedding.

In A Dance with Dragons, it is finally revealed that Tyrion has successfully fled Westeros with help from Varys, who stays in King's Landing but arranges for Illyrio Mopatis to shelter him in Pentos. While in Illyrio's mansion, Tyrion is persuaded by Illyrio to travel to Meereen with some companions to aid Daenerys Targaryen in reclaiming the Iron Throne, and in the process to take his revenge on both Cersei and Jaime (though he expresses a desire to rape and kill Cersei, he begins to have second thoughts about Jaime near the end of the book).

Tyrion soon joins Illyrio's friends - a sellsword named Griff, his son and their servants (all of whom have been omitted from the TV show). Soon he learns to know that Griff and his son are in fact the presumed-dead Jon Connington and Aegon Targaryen, the son of Rhaegar and Elia. Connington treats Tyrion hostilely, but Aegon befriends him. 

Aegon tells Tyrion that he will soon meet Daenerys, marry her, she will give him her troops and dragons, and together they will sail to Westeros and conquer it. Tyrion pours cold water on the overconfident youth's hopes, pointing out his aunt is not some timid little girl who does whatever she is told, but a powerful queen, who has crossed deserts, survived assassins, rallied armies and conquered cities. Tyrion concludes that if Aegon appears before her like that (even with the Golden Company), he'll look like a beggar; he advises Aegon to travel to Westeros instead, raise his banners, rally supporters, and then Daenerys will come and meet him as equals. Aegon accepts Tyrion's advice.

During the journey, they pass Volantis and are attacked by Stone Men. Tyrion falls into the water, but is rescued by Connington, who (not Jorah Mormont) gets infected with greyscale in the process.

While in a brothel (not in Volantis itself, but one of its outlying towns), Tyrion is captured by Jorah Mormont, who intends to take him to Daenerys. They also meet Penny, one of the dwarfs who performed at Joffrey's wedding and whose brother Oppo has recently been killed by dwarf hunters seeking Tyrion; she initially blames Tyrion for Oppo's death and attempts to kill him, but eventually realizes it was not his fault. They board a ship whose destination is Qarth. One of the passengers is Moqorro, a Red Priest who was sent by the High Priest of Volantis, to offer Daenerys guidance and help. Moqorro tells Tyrion he has seen him in a vision as "a small man with a big shadow." Tyrion is flattered to hear that, but is also skeptical.

The ship is badly damaged in a storm. After floating for days, the passengers are captured by slave traders. Tyrion and Penny  are sold to Yezzan zo Qaggaz (who is vastly different from his series counterpart) in his tent in the siege camp outside Meereen; Tyrion saves Jorah from being sold for the fighting pits by persuading the mean overseer of Yezzan's slaves to buy him too, claiming that Jorah participates the show which Tyrion and Penny play. Soon Tyrion impresses Yezzan by through his skill at Cyvasse, a popular board game.

Tyrion and Penny are made to perform in Daznak's Pit, during which Tyrion sees Daenerys from afar and very nearly calls out to her, but stops himself after noticing Barristan Selmy beside her, who may prejudice her against him due to their shared hatred for the Lannisters. The slave masters intend to unleash a pack of lions into the pit, but Daenerys puts a stop to the act, unknowingly saving Tyrion's life.

The "bloody flux" plague decimates the siege; Yezzan is among its victims. Tyrion seizes the opportunity to escape with Jorah and Penny to the camp of the Second Sons, who have recently betrayed Daenerys to side with the armies of Yunkai. Tyrion and Jorah join the sellsword company, intending to persuade them to change their allegiance back to Daenerys in exchange for the wealth of Casterly Rock, his birthright since Jaime has renounced it. Meanwhile, back in King's Landing, Varys shoots Kevan Lannister with a crossbow to fool Cersei into thinking Tyrion is still in the capital.

Tyrion is set to return in The Winds of Winter. A released sample chapter reveals that he and Jorah successfully persuade  the Second Sons to rejoin Daenerys and fight for her, while the battle against the Yunkish is going on. Author George R. R. Martin has also confirmed that Tyrion and Daenerys will meet face to face in the book.

As much as Tyrion loathed Joffrey, he wouldn't harm him due to the taboo of kinslaying. After he is told the truth about Tysha, it seems Tyrion does not care anymore about that taboo: he kills his father, and in the fifth novel he brags about the kinslayings he has performed, the actual (his father) and the alleged (Joffrey) alike; he even takes the "credit" for his mother's death, and also states he intends to kill his siblings.

Tyrion and Jaime have always been on good terms. When Tyrion was small, Jaime brought him toys, barrel hoops, blocks and a carved wooden lion. He gave Tyrion his first pony and taught him how to ride. Tyrion vividly recalls all that in the fifth novel, when he thinks about Tysha; he is filled with bitterness at the thought that he was betrayed by his brother, his own blood, whom he never doubted. Yet, by the end of the novel, Jaime is the first name that comes to his mind when he is asked "what do you miss?"; perhaps Tyrion begins to have second thoughts about Jaime, although he has not forgiven him yet.

According to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, "Tyrion Lannister" is pronounced "TEER-ee-un LAN-iss-ter."
