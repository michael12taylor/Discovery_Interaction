<html><p>Upon arriving in Westeros, Arya travels to the Twins where she disguises herself as a serving girl. After Jaime and his soldiers depart for King's Landing, Arya manages to kill both "Lame" Lothar Frey and "Black" Walder Rivers, who were responsible for the deaths of Talisa Stark and her mother Catelyn Stark, respectively. She then proceeds to dismember their bodies and bake them into a pie, which she serves to Lord Walder Frey as the two are alone in the dining hall, still wearing the face of a serving girl. After she reveals her true identity, she slits Walder's throat and watches with amusement as he dies.

Season 7
Arya reveals herself after poisoning the sons of House Frey.
After killing Lord Walder, Arya uses his face to impersonate him and hold a feast in honor of all of his sons. She gives a rousing speech, "reminiscing" over House Frey's victories, before offering her audience a toast of poisoned wine. As Walder's many sons drink from their chalices, Arya refuses to let any of the women partake, aware of their innocence. She then elicits cheers from the many Frey sons upon the mention of the infamous Red Wedding, though then goes on to subtly mock them by reminding them of how they butchered a pregnant woman, cut the throat of a mother of five, and slaughtered the Starks after inviting them into their home. As the Frey sons begin to cough up blood from the poison, Arya watches with satisfaction as they all die before removing her mask and revealing herself. Before leaving, she asks Walder's wife, Kitty Frey, to tell anyone that might ask what happened that "the north remembers", and remarks that winter has come for House Frey.

Arya camps with Lannister soldiers.
After departing from the Twins, Arya comes across a small convoy of Lannister soldiers, one of which gains her attention with a sweet song. Arya agrees, upon request, to join them at their fire, and accepts their offerings of food and drink, though cautiously. She engages in some small talk with them, including the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor, all the while keeping her eye on their swords, and states that she is heading for King's Landing. After she admits that she is planning on killing Queen Cersei, they laugh, unaware that this is her true intention.

Arya chooses her home over revenge.

Arya later visits the Inn at the Crossroads where she overhears some patrons discussing the recent arrival of Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons. She is reunited with Hot Pie, who brings her several pies which she eagerly consumes. He reminds her of the destruction of the Sept of Baelor at the hands of Queen Cersei and informs her of his own encounter with Brienne. She offers to pay for her meal when she has finished, but Hot Pie refuses her coin as a friendly gesture. Upon learning that her half-brother Jon has taken back Winterfell from the Boltons and become the King in the North, Arya decides to finally head home after leaving the inn, instead of heading to King's Landing. 
Arya reunites with Nymeria.
On her way to Winterfell, Arya makes a small campfire in the woods. As she warms herself by the fire, she is suddenly ambushed by a large pack of wild wolves, which startles her horse. Surrounded, Arya pulls out Needle to defend herself, though the wolves do not attack, and Arya finds herself face to face with a now fully grown Nymeria, much to her astonishment. She pleads for her Direwolf to come with her to Winterfell, but Nymeria instead retreats with her pack back into the woods. Arya realizes that Nymeria is no longer the same and that she has also changed herself since they last saw each other. Softly, and with a small smile, she murmurs, "That's not you", echoing what she said to her father years ago when he suggested that someday she would marry a powerful lord.

Arya Stark finally returns to Winterfell. She rides up to the gates and dismounts, but the guards don't believe her when she identifies herself as Arya Stark, convinced that Arya has been dead for years. Arya asks that they send word to Maester Luwin and Rodrik Cassel, who can prove her identity (not knowing they are both dead). The guards brush her off, telling Arya there is nobody by those names at Winterfell. Arya asks for Jon, but they say he actually just left Winterfell, so Arya asks who is in charge of Winterfell. The guards respond, "Lady Stark," who Arya realizes is her sister. They try to brush her aside, but she dodges them with her assassin's reflexes, and insists that one way or another she's getting in. She explains to them that if she is Arya, they'll be in a lot of trouble for stopping her, and if she isn't, she won't last long in Winterfell anyway. Mildly concerned, they agree to at least let her in the courtyard, but insist that she stay put while they send for Sansa so they can disprove her identity. As soon as they take their eyes off her, however, she slips away. The two guards go to inform Sansa and try to wave the incident aside as just some impostor, but she instantly realizes it must be Arya, and knows where she has gone.

Arya reunites with Sansa.
Sansa finds Arya where she expected, in the crypts looking over their father's grave. They are happy to see each other, but so much has happened to both of them in the past few years that they are at first awkward, unsure of what to say. Arya asks if she has to call Sansa "Lady Stark" now, to which Sansa firmly insists "Yes" - and then laughs. They smile and hug, though still a bit unsure. Arya notes that Jon left her in charge and smiles when Sansa says that she hopes Jon will be back soon -  he will be so happy to see Arya, remembering how happy Jon was to see her when they were reunited, and the pair were never that close (unlike Jon and Arya). The sisters then look sadly on their father's grave statue. Arya says it doesn't really look like him. Sansa acknowledges that everyone who really knew his face is dead. Arya points out that they're not.

Arya then asks if Sansa really killed Joffrey. Sansa explains she actually didn't, though she wished she had. Arya remarks that he was always at the top of her "list." This confuses Sansa, and Arya explains that she'd been keeping a list of everyone she was going to kill - at which they both laugh. Finally, Sansa asks how Arya got back, but she only says her road wasn't a pleasant one. Sansa says hers wasn't either. They hug again, earnestly and warmly. Sansa then informs Arya that Bran is home too. Arya is elated, but her smile fades when Sansa does not mention Rickon, realizing that Rickon is dead.

Arya reunites with Bran.
Sansa brings Arya to Bran in the godswood, where he is lost in thought by the Weirwood heart tree. Arya is saddened to see him paralyzed. Still somewhat detached even at the sight of Arya, Bran says he isn't surprised she's alive because he saw her at the Crossroads. Arya is confused, and Sansa explains that Bran is having "visions" now. Bran says he thought Arya was going to King's Landing, and when Sansa asks why she would head there of all places, he again startles them both by saying it's because Cersei is on her list of names (which he can't possibly be aware of through normal means). Sansa asks who else is on her list, but she says most of them besides Cersei are actually dead already. They then remark on the Valyrian steel dagger in his lap, and he explains that Littlefinger gave it to him, thinking he'd want it. Despite it being such a horrible keepsake that nearly killed him and indirectly set off a chain of events leading to his parents' deaths, he is still listless and disinterested in it. Arya is confused as to why a common cutthroat would have a rare, priceless blade of Valyrian steel. Bran matter-of-factly says that someone very wealthy wanted him dead, and gave it to the assassin. Bran says that doesn't matter and hands it to Arya, saying she can have it because it's "wasted on a cripple." The three trueborn Stark children, finally reunited, proceed back to Winterfell's castle courtyard, with Arya pushing Bran in his wheelchair.

Arya spars with Brienne.
Some time later, Brienne is going through a vigorous sword practice session with Podrick, knocking him down when he overextends himself. Impressed, Arya interrupts and says she'd like to spar with Brienne - the woman who beat the Hound in combat. Sansa and Littlefinger watch on silently from the walkway above. Brienne goes easy on her at first, but then Arya completely outmaneuvers Brienne using the Water Dance training she received from Syrio Forel, augmented by her training with the Faceless Men. Arya achieves many openings that would be a killing blow if she wanted them to be. Surprised that such a young girl is so skilled, Brienne stops holding back, leading to a grueling sparring session. Brienne actually manages to knock Needle out of Arya's hand but she simply switches to the Valyrian steel dagger she had in her belt. Arya uses her speed and agility to compensate for Brienne's strength and size to overwhelm her - until Brienne actually manages to bring her brute strength to bear on a fast moving target by landing a kick on Arya's chest that sends her sprawling. Brienne stops for a moment as Arya lies motionless, shocked at what she has done to a noblewoman. However, Arya swings her legs around and jumps up, causing Brienne to grin in relief. Ultimately, they reach a stalemate, with each of them holding a blade at the others' throat. Arya takes her leave of Brienne, both mutually impressed, as Sansa looks down baffled at how her sister reached such a deadly skill level. Arya then looks up at the battlements, where Petyr watched her duel with Brienne, giving him an untrustworthy stare until he walks away.

Arya later watches in the great hall as Sansa addresses Lords Glover and Royce over their concerns with Jon's absence. Glover says that perhaps they should have chosen Sansa instead due to his feeling that the King in the North should stay in the North while Royce says that the Vale came to Sansa's aid during the Battle for Winterfell. In response, Sansa kindly dismisses their notions, once again pledging her loyalty to Jon. In their late mother and father's chambers, Arya confronts Sansa about her apparent inaction towards Glover and Royce, claiming that she should have taken their heads for defying Jon's rule. Sansa reminds her sister that this would likely lose the support of both House Glover and the Vale and that they need to work together in order to survive. Arya is adamant that they should have been executed. Suspicious of Sansa and her relationship with Littlefinger, Arya begins to spy on him, following him to Sansa's bedchambers where he hides a rolled parchment inside of her mattress. Arya, unaware that the letter, written by Sansa after their father's imprisonment in the Red Keep in which she pledges her loyalty to Joffrey and the crown and urges Robb to submit to his rule, has been planted on purpose by Baelish in order to manipulate her, falls for his scheme and reads the letter, growing suspicious of her sister as she is also unaware that Sansa was coerced into writing the letter by Cersei. From the shadows, Littlefinger watches with satisfaction as Arya leaves the room.

Arya confronts Sansa about their father's death.
Arya and Sansa's relationship continues to grow increasingly strained following Arya's discovery of her sister's "incriminating" letter. Watching over the castle courtyard from the balcony, Arya reminisces about how their father used to watch her and her brothers train in the very same spot, bitterly claiming that Sansa wouldn't remember due to the fact that she was usually inside the castle knitting with her fellow ladies. She then tells Sansa how on one particular day, after their brothers had finished training with Ser Rodrik, she wandered into the vacant courtyard and began practicing her archery with Bran's discarded bow as their father watched from above.

Arya then resentfully states that he was killed by the Lannisters with Sansa's help, reading Sansa's letter to her aloud. Sansa insists that she was forced to write it and, being a naïve child that she was at the time, was led to believe that she was saving her family. However, Arya is adamant to point out that had she been in Sansa's position, she would have died before betraying her family, calling her stupid for believing in the Lannisters' lies. Arya reveals that she, like Sansa, was present during their father's execution and that she saw the whole thing from the statue of Baelor. Arya surmises that Sansa is afraid she will show the letter to the northern lords, thus losing their respect. Taking advantage of the tension between the two sisters, Littlefinger later suggests to Sansa that she use Lady Brienne to protect her from Arya.

Arya tells Sansa about the "Game of Faces."
In her bedchamber, Arya finds Sansa looking through her bag, which is full of her faces from Braavos. Confronting her sister, Arya toys with Sansa, insisting that they play the "game of faces", hoping to catch her in a lie and expose her disloyalty to Jon. Sansa, unwilling to play, instead insists that Arya explain the nature of her faces. Arya reveals that with the faces, she can be whomever she wants to be. Grasping her Valyrian steel catspaw dagger, she approaches her sister in a somewhat threatening manner, wondering aloud what it might feel like to wear pretty silk dresses and be the Lady of Winterfell should she take Sansa's face. Arya then hands her the dagger and promptly heads out the door, leaving her sister visibly disturbed.

Arya kills Petyr on Sansa's orders.
Arya is summoned to the Great Hall for a meeting with her sister and sees Bran and Sansa seated at the head of the great table, with Littlefinger smirking in the crowd. Sansa proceeds to list a series of crimes against House Stark... and directs them to Baelish, not Arya. Arya watches with satisfaction as Sansa and Bran turn the tables on Littlefinger and finally call him into account for his crimes, with Arya herself reminding Petyr that her new Valyrian steel dagger originally belonged to him. When Baelish's attempts to manipulate the situation turn to pleading, Arya moves in and slits his throat with his own dagger at Sansa's direction. Later, Arya and Sansa discuss their pasts, Arya saying that she couldn't have survived what Sansa survived. Sansa says she thinks Arya could have, Arya being the strongest person she knows. They then discuss the execution and the survival of their House, finally reaching an accord to play to each other's strengths - like the wolves of their sigil, they will survive as a pack.

Season 8
Arya stands among the residents of the winter town as they watch Jon, Queen Daenerys Targaryen, and their combined forces march through the town to Winterfell. She notices Gendry among the entourage, but he doesn't appear to notice her. When Drogon and Rhaegal fly overhead, roaring, Arya is the only person among the crowd who doesn't appear startled or frightened; on the contrary, she is visibly fascinated by the dragons. She is not present in Winterfell's courtyard when Jon and Daenerys arrive before the Stark entourage, and Sansa replies that she is "lurking somewhere" when Jon inquires about her.

Arya reunites with Jon.
She silently approaches Jon in the godswood; when Jon asks how she could move so stealthily, Arya asks how he survived a knife through the heart, to which Jon replies that he didn't. After a moment's hesitation, the two run into each other's arms. Jon notices that Arya still has Needle and asks if she's ever used it and Arya quietly replies, "Once or twice." Jon shows her his sword Longclaw, which Arya is impressed by but comments it would be too heavy for her to wield. Jon asks where she was earlier, saying he could have used her help with Sansa as Sansa is at odds with Daenerys, the latter who Jon bent the knee to and fell in love with. Arya realizes, "[Sansa] doesn't like your queen, does she?" and says Sansa is the smartest person she knows. Jon is surprised Arya is now defending Sansa; Arya replies both she and Sansa are defending their family, advising Jon not to forget he's family too and they embrace a final time.

Arya reunites with Sandor.
Arya later visits Winterfell's forges and comes upon Gendry presenting the Hound with a custom-made axe of dragonglass, which the latter is not especially impressed with. She tells him to stop insulting Gendry's work and the two lock eyes. Before he leaves, the Hound gives Arya a back-handed compliment; calling her a "cold little bitch", but saying that's probably why she's still alive. 

Arya reunites with Gendry.
Alone, Arya and Gendry exchange banter, recalling their past time together and she asks him to craft a special weapon for her. Although skeptical, Gendry agrees. Arya shows him her dagger of Valyrian steel, and he playfully replies that he always knew she was just another highborn girl. Before leaving, Arya cheekily shoots back that Gendry doesn't know any other highborn girls.

With the news that the army of the dead has taken Last Hearth and is advancing towards Winterfell, the inhabitants of the castle increase the speed of their preparations. Arya returns to the forges and asks Gendry if her weapon is ready, but he is still crafting her design. Annoyed, she tells him to prioritize it, before asking him what fighting the wights was like. Gendry replies, "Bad. Really bad." Arya is unsatisfied with "really bad" and keeps pushing for details until Gendry sums up their likeness in one word: "death." Gendry says that whatever bravery and fighting skill she has, the wights are like nothing she's ever faced. Unperturbed, Arya casually picks up three dragonglass daggers and throws them, one after another, into a wooden beam over Gendry’s shoulder, landing them in a tight formation. While doing so, she explains her familiarity with death and her excitement of what is to come, and Gendry stands, mesmerized at her deadpan surety and confidence.

While practicing her archery, Arya receives her weapon from Gendry: a quarterstaff mounted with dragonglass blades. When she asks what happened between Gendry and Melisandre, he tells her of the leech ritual. She probes him further, forcing him to admit his parentage as Robert's bastard, and asks if he was a virgin before the ritual. Gendry claims that he was not intimate with Melisandre, but admits that he has before slept with three girls. 

Arya gives into her feelings for Gendry.
Arya, due to her ability to distinguish truth and lies (via her mastery of the "Game of Faces"), changes topic and states that since the two of them are likely to die soon, she wants to know the feeling of physical love before she does. She kisses him forcefully on the lips, after which Gendry shows some slight resistance, but he finally gives into the overwhelming sense of attraction, though he is briefly startled by the scars on her rib cage. Gendry sleeps soundly after their liaison, whilst Arya lies awake, awaiting the arrival of the White Walkers.

As the battle commences, Arya is stationed on the walls overlooking the battlefield alongside Sansa. After the wights easily defeat the initial charge of Dothraki screamers and begin to overwhelm the living beyond the trench, Arya tells Sansa to go to the crypts and hands her a dragonglass dagger. Sansa says she doesn't know how to use it, and Arya simply says "stick 'em with the pointy end. Arya shoots flaming arrows at the wights as the army retreats into the Winterfell, narrowly saving the Hound as well. As Daenerys couldn't light the trench as planned, due to being caught in a blizzard conjured by the White Walkers, Davos orders the archers to light the trench and Arya shoots into it as well, however the arrows arrow doused as soon as the hit the trench and are unable to light it. Melisandre manages to light the trench, giving the living some moment of reprieve, which when the Night King commands some of the wights to go into some parts of the trench, smothering the flames and allowing the rest to cross.

Arya fights the dead on the ramparts of Winterfell.
Arya participates in the fighting on the ramparts with the dragonglass weapon Gendry made for her. She skillfully kills off many wights, much to Davos's surprise, but is nearly surrounded and narrowly escapes. However, she loses her weapon in the process and sustains a head injury after being knocked into a doorway by a wight. Disoriented and bleeding from the gash at the side of her head, Arya feels a newfound fear for the wights. Arya escapes through a window into the castle, as she traverses through the corridors, she takes a dead soldier's dragonglass dagger.

Arya hides from the wights.
Making her way from the library, she takes a brief moment to catch her breath before she realizes that wights have entered the room. She carefully hides from them, between the bookshelves and underneath a table. Arya then throws a book into an area of the room away from the exit, distracting the wights and giving her an opening to escape. She quietly dispatches a wight on the way and closes the door behind her. Her relief is short-lived, as more wights broke into the corridor through another door and alert the ones in the library of her presence, proceeding to chase her.

Beric incinerates a wight, saving Arya.
Beric and the Hound have entered the castle to find and rescue Arya. She appears when a wight tackles her through a door, breaking it off its hinges, and prepares to kill her when she's pinned underneath him. Beric throws his flaming sword into it and helps her to her feet. More wights come through the doorway and Beric is stabbed in the leg whilst the Hound fights more wights. As the three try to escape the corridor, Arya watches as Beric runs in front of her to pin a wight to a wall and gets stabbed by more wights. Arya picks up a dragonglass hatchet and kills the wights hurting him, but the Hound picks her up and leaves Beric as more wights swarm in.

Beric dies after saving Arya.
The two make it into the great hall, which is littered with dead bodies, and Beric makes it too but succumbs to his wounds shortly afterwards. Melisandre appears, saying that Beric had fulfilled his purpose. Arya states that she remembers her and that the red priestess said they would meet again. She recounts what Melisandre said to her; that she would shut many eyes forever.

Melisandre reminds Arya of her destiny.
Melisandre confirms this, reminding the colors of the eyes, including blue - those of the army of the dead. At this, Arya goes through a realization. As wights try and fail to enter through the door, Melisandre asks "what do we say to the God of Death?" and Arya replies "not today", reminding her further of her training under Syrio Forel and her abilities gained from her time as an acolyte of the Faceless Men. They share one last look before Arya leaves her and the Hound. The Night King arrives to the godswood after his army cleared the path for him, and prepares to kill Bran after killing Theon. However, Arya slips past his forces and launches a surprise rear attack with her Valyrian steel dagger.

Arya kills the Night King.
Though he reacts swiftly enough to whip around and catch her by the neck and arm, Arya drops her dagger from the arm he is restraining, catches it in her free hand and plunges it into his heart, causing the Night King to shatter into icy shards. With his death, the White Walkers shatter as well, and the horde of wights, including Viserion, drop dead as the magic animating them died with the Night King and his lieutenants, bringing an end to the White Walkers, wights and the Long Night forever.

Arya attends the cremation of the fallen.
Arya is present when the bodies of those who fell during the Battle of Winterfell are set to be cremated. After Jon finishes his eulogy, she is handed a torch and goes to burn the pyre where Beric was laid. In the subsequent celebrations, Arya chooses not to participate, not entirely welcoming as being hailed as the "Hero of Winterfell." Gendry later seeks her out and finds her practicing her archery, narrowly avoiding getting hit by one upon doing so. He tells Arya that Daenerys legitimized him and he's now the new Lord of Storm's End. Gendry also kneels, and confesses to Arya that he loves her, and wants to marry her and have her become the Lady of Storm's End. 

Arya silently judges Daenerys's conquest of Westeros.
Arya, at a loss for words, reciprocates this by kissing him but declines the proposal. She says that any woman would be lucky to marry him, saying "that's not [her]", words she said to her father years earlier. Arya continues to practice her archery and Gendry is left heartbroken.

Later, Arya attends the discussions regarding Daenerys resuming her conquest of Westeros. While Daenerys asserts that King's Landing must be taken as soon as possible, Sansa counters that their men are exhausted from fighting the White Walkers and need rest, to which Arya silently agrees. 

Arya and Sansa express their lack of faith in Daenerys.
Jon reaffirms his loyalty to Daenerys's cause and states that the North will march to King's Landing, much to his sisters' displeasure. As the meeting's adjourned, Arya blocks Jon before he could leave the room and all the siblings all go down to the godswood to talk. Arya and Sansa express their distrust towards Daenerys while Jon defends her, stating she is the reason they survived the battle. Arya concedes that Jon did the right thing when he bent the knee to Daenerys as they needed Daenerys's dragons and her army, but adds that they're doing the right thing when they tell Jon they don't trust Daenerys. Jon insists they just need time to get to know her but Arya says they'll never know her because she's not one of them. Jon protests they can't only trust the people they grew up with and Arya replies she only needs her family, they are the last of the Starks. Jon responds he's not a Stark; Sansa and Arya disagree, Arya telling Jon, "You're my brother. Not my half-brother or my bastard brother. My brother." This prompts Jon to decide to tell his sisters the truth of his heritage - but only after they swear this information to secrecy. Once Arya and Sansa vow not to tell, Jon has Bran tell them.

Arya and Sandor depart Winterfell.
As Sandor leaves Winterfell, he hears the sound of another horse approaching him and sees Arya. Arya moves to ride alongside Sandor, who inquires why she was leaving. Arya vaguely hints her intentions and Sandor likewise does. It becomes clear to both of them that they intend to seek their long-awaited respective revenge on Cersei and the Mountain, whilst having no intentions to return to Winterfell. The two proceed to ride towards King's Landing, reminiscent of when they were together years before. The two arrive at the camp of the Northern army the night before battle is set to begin. They are initially stopped by the Night Guard, but are allowed to continue when she states that killing Cersei may prevent a siege.

Arya bids farewell to Sandor.
Arya bluntly informs the guard that she came to kill Cersei, and it doesn't take much persuasion from the Hound for the guard to allow them to pass. The two enter King's Landing and manage to infiltrate the Red Keep amid the crowd of refugees scrambling inside. As the buildings of the Red Keep start to collapse all around them, Arya is still determined to carry out her revenge on Cersei. However, Sandor, witnessing the destruction being wrought by Daenerys on top of Drogon, dissuades Arya. He earnestly discourages her from ending up like him - beaten down by the world and driven by nothing the desire for vengeance. She thanks him, calling him 'Sandor' for the first time, and bids a final goodbye before fleeing. 

Arya awakens to the destruction of King's Landing.
Arya tries to flee the city but is trapped in by the mass of scared people fleeing the dragon's flames. She tries to rescue the inhabitants but is knocked unconscious, unable to help anyone. Regaining her consciousness after the Battle of King's Landing is over, she witnesses the city in ruins and leaves on a horseback, shell-shocked by Daenerys's massacre.

Arya attends the Great Council.
She later reunites with Jon and warns him against his loyalty to Daenerys because of his bloodline and Sansa's refusal to bend the knee to her in the future. She also witnesses Daenerys' speech to the Dothraki and Unsullied. Weeks after Daenerys is assassinated, she takes part in the trial of Tyrion. When Yara Greyjoy agrees with the idea of Unsullied doing whatever they want with Jon, Arya threatens to kill her. Davos however manages to defuse the situation. Tyrion then suggests that the lords of Westeros choose their new king or queen and recommends Bran. Arya assents, though she withholds her vote as Sansa declares the North's independence at the meeting. 

Arya bids farewell to Jon.
After Bran exiles Jon into the Night's Watch to prevent a war with the Unsullied, the Stark siblings bid him a final farewell on the docks of King's Landing. Arya informs them all that she has decided to sail to the west of Westeros, where no one has ever gone before, fulfilling her promise to Lady Crane. When Jon asks if she has Needle with her, she assures him that she does. She later captains a ship flying the Stark sigil, and departs into uncharted waters.

Kill list
{Cersei Lannister} - For her role in the execution of her father and the death of Lady. Crushed by debris during the Battle of King's Landing.
{The Mountain} - For leading the brutal torture at Harrenhal. Revived by Qyburn from his presumed death at the hands of Oberyn Martell. Killed by his brother, Sandor Clegane, during the Battle of King's Landing.
{Walder Frey} - For his role in killing her brother and mother. Killed by Arya after she gained entry to his castle using a Faceless Men shapeshifter mask. Arya first killed Lord Walder's sons Lame Lothar and Black Walder Rivers (who each respectively killed her pregnant sister-in-law and mother during the Red Wedding), then fed their flesh to the unwitting Lord Walder baked into a pie.
{Polliver} - For killing her friend Lommy, stealing her sword Needle, and taking part in the brutal torture at Harrenhal. Stabbed though the neck with Needle by Arya while repeating the same words Polliver said to Lommy when he killed him.
{Joffrey Baratheon} - For ordering the execution of her father. Assassinated at his own wedding by Olenna Tyrell.
{Rorge} - For threatening to rape her. Stabbed in the heart with Needle by Arya just after adding him to the list.
{The Hound} - For killing her friend Mycah and being a Lannister lackey. Severely injured by Brienne of Tarth and left to die by Arya. He actually survived, though she doesn't know it, and she later admitted that by that point part of her didn't want him to die and she had already removed him from the list. By Season 8, she met Sandor again, now as a grudging ally, and made no effort to kill him. Perished during the King's Landing siege, throwing himself and his brother, Gregor, into a fiery chasm during their personal fight.
{Tywin Lannister} - For leading the Lannisters against her brother. Killed by his own son, Tyrion Lannister, with a crossbow.
{Meryn Trant} - For killing her dancing master Syrio Forel and aiding Cersei in her coup. Killed by Arya in a Braavosi brothel where she was disguised as Ghita.
Arya's list logically only contains those whom she knows have committed crimes against her or her family. Despite committing great crimes against her family, Littlefinger was never included in her kill list; after Bran revealed his betrayal towards their father Arya did kill him, but on Sansa's orders. Roose Bolton was never included because she was unaware that he was present at the Red Wedding, much less that he personally killed Robb. She is also unaware of the fact that Roose's son, Ramsay, sacked Winterfell (and later killed Rickon). Arya also hasn't included Theon Greyjoy for taking Winterfell in the first place and (allegedly) killing her brothers Bran and Rickon, because she wasn't aware that it happened while she was on the run. News of the fall of Winterfell only became widespread enough for her to hear of it after Ramsay recaptured the castle (in early Season 4) and supposedly killed Theon, thus he was never added to her list.

For a while, Arya added the Melisandre, Beric Dondarrion, and Thoros of Myr to her list, because she was upset the Brotherhood Without Banners let Melisandre take Gendry away and postponed taking her to her family in Riverrun. She later phased them out of her list, presumably because they didn't do anything remotely near what other people in the list had done, also one of her main motivations for keeping Beric and Thoros on the list was that they released the Hound despite his crimes which she later forgave. Arya later confirmed in Season 8's "A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms" that Beric was on her list for a little while, but not anymore.

Ilyn Payne, the executioner who beheaded her father, was also phased out of her list, maybe because he was a hired hand simply following orders like the Hound. Furthermore, the actor who plays Ilyn Payne developed pancreatic cancer after Season 1 and very nearly died, and he never returned to the series.

Following the deaths of Cersei and the Mountain, her list is officially complete.

Personality
Arya is a fiercely independent woman who is unconstrained by social expectations like gender roles, courtly virtues, class distinctions, and the expectations of her parents and siblings. A tomboy, she never aspired to be a "proper lady" as her older sister Sansa did. Before the series of events that shatter her innocence and destroy her support system, Arya is full of life, and she makes others smile just by virtue of her spirited indifference to rules. 

Once she begins the journey to King's Landing, however, she endures a constant stream of loss and trauma. As she watches her pet, sword instructor, friends, and family members taken from her one by one, she becomes increasingly detached towards murder and death. This is only exacerbated when she is captured by the Hound and is exposed to his fatalistic worldview as they traverse the war-ravaged Riverlands, though the two develop a mutual reliance and almost grudging respect for each other. When she witnesses and learns of the betrayal and murder of her family at the Red Wedding, she becomes colder and her urge to seek revenge on those who have wronged her and her family increases.

While she is initially horrified when she accidentally stabs the stableboy in King's Landing during the betrayal of her father and his men, by the time she and the Hound have fled the massacre at the Twins, she is able to kill without remorse and has accepted Syrio's belief that the only true god is Death. Following Yoren's advice to her before he died, she has taken to listing off the names of each person she intends to kill each night before she sleeps.

Arya can be a rather cold-blooded and slightly sadistic person at times, especially while confronting and killing those who are on her death list. Though she was initially apathetic but satisfied with killing Meryn Trant and Polliver, she did not attempt to hide her glee over slitting Walder Frey's throat, or the pleasure of seeing his family dying from poisoned wine she gave them. While she certainly possesses compassion and kindness, her time with The Hound and the Faceless Men have taught her to be ruthless to those who have wronged her and her family and has shown to be willing to use psychological mind games to worsen her enemies fate before killing them. This is shown when she repeated every word Polliver said to Lommy before killing him in the same exact way with Needle; gouged the eyes of Ser Meryn before stabbing him repeatedly and butchering Lord Walder's sons before serving their corpses to their father inside of a pie.

That being said, Arya is not completely blinded by revenge. After learning that her family has retaken Winterfell, she ultimately chooses reuniting with her loved ones over vengeance against her enemies (at least for the time being).

Arya seems to prefer staying out of politics. During a war meeting, planning for the Battle of King's Landing, Arya was clearly distrustful of Daenerys when she wanted northern troops to fight immediately. However, she did not actively speak out against her, preferring to let Sansa speak on her behalf. Later, instead of taking any action involving the truth about Jon's true parentage, she instead rides with the Hound to King's Landing to kill Cersei. Later, during the council meeting to elect the next monarch Arya withholds her vote for Bran since Sansa declares the North an independent kingdom and only speaks to threaten Yara when she suggests letting the unsullied keep Jon. All of this speaks to her preferring to let Sansa speak for her family on political matters and for her to focus on confronting threats to her family, friends, and herself in a more direct matter, outside of politics.

Behind the scenes
Maisie Williams plays Arya as left-handed, but the actress is actually right-handed.
In the novels, Arya is left-handed. Maisie Williams is right-handed, but plays Arya as left-handed to be true to the books, including learning how to fight with a sword in her left hand. Maisie's mother discovered that Arya is left-handed while reading the books, and urged her to play Arya left-handed, for fear that if she didn't, hardcore fans of the books would be outraged and instantly reject her performance.

When Arya goes blind in the Season 5 finale, continuing into Season 6, the clouded look in her eyes is not a CGI effect at all: Maisie Williams actually wore large, 16 millimeter-wide contact lenses, hand-painted so they were murky. They did not simply give her eyes the appearance of being blind, but cannot be seen through. Thus when Arya is wildly turning around unable to see her surroundings, Williams truly couldn't see anything, and thus gave a genuine performance of being blinded.

Williams stated in an April 2016 interview that she was not given a choice between using a CGI effect or the blinding-contacts: the production team told her to use the blinding-contacts from the start. She went on to explain that the true blindness contacts were only used in closeups or when she was standing still (such as the Season 5 finale). Otherwise, when she had to stumble around while "blind" in Season 6, she switched to contacts which had tiny pinprick holes in the center so she could still see, so she wouldn't harm herself or others (some of her scenes involved fighting with a stick while "blind"). The times when she is moving around and wearing the alternate contacts she can actually see through were then simply filmed in wide-shots so the camera wouldn't pick up the difference - but then she would switch back to the full-blindness contact lenses again for closeups and dialogue-heavy shots without much motion in them.

Kristina Baskett was a stunt double for Maisie Williams in the role of Arya Stark.

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Arya is portrayed in much darker manner than in the show. As her plotline progresses, she gradually loses her humanity, to the point she murders people without any provocation.

Arya is nine years old when King Robert arrives at Winterfell. She is a tomboy who wants to learn how to fight with a sword and ride horses, to the horror of her more demure older sister, Sansa, with whom she has a quarrelsome relationship. She is encouraged by her half-brother Jon, to whom she is close. Sansa and Arya are so unalike that Sansa once asked their mother if her real sister was stolen by a grumpkin and Arya was left in her place. Arya is the only one of the Starks' trueborn children who resembles their father in appearance. Jon also inherited the Stark look, like Arya and their father, which once caused Arya to wonder whether she was also a bastard, but Jon assured her that she is trueborn. Arya has Eddard's long and solemn face, her hair is lustrless brown, which results in her being called Arya Horseface by her sister and her sister's friends. She is also known as Arya Underfoot by the Winterfell staff, as she is always curious and always where she isn't supposed to be. In the TV series, she is a good shot with a bow. In the novels, she does not know how to use a bow and isn't strong enough to even pull back the string, but wishes she could. She does, however, skilled in household management and horseback riding (in contrast to Sansa).

According to Catelyn, Ned's visitors would often mistake Arya for a stableboy if they rode into the yard unannounced. Arya was a trial, half a boy and half a wolf pup. She collected scabs as other girls collect dolls, and would say anything that came into her head. If someone forbade her anything, it became her heart's desire. Her hair always looked as though a bird has been nesting in it. Catelyn despaired of ever making a lady of her. 

Yoren does not tell Arya the story about Willem and how he came to be part of the Night's Watch. Reciting the names of her enemies is something that she starts doing on her own. Yoren does tell her that her father was not supposed to die that day. The reason Yoren was in the Sept of Baelor and not already on the road is because he was told by Varys, the same man that came bringing Gendry, that Lord Eddard was to be given mercy, allowed to take the black, and would be traveling back with him to the Wall. When he says something must have gone wrong, Arya replies, "Joffrey. Someone should kill him."

During Season 2 of the TV series, she serves as Tywin's cupbearer. In the novels, she serves Roose Bolton, who captured Harrenhal from Amory Lorch after Tywin leaves with his army to defend the Westerlands. Thus, none of the scenes between Tywin and Arya happened in the books. She still flees from Harrenhal with Gendry and Hot Pie, but she does so without using Jaqen H'ghar's help; though in the novels she does use Jaqen's help to open Harrenhal to Roose Bolton and the Northmen.

Arya's storyline at Harrenhal in Season 2 was heavily condensed from the books. After being captured by Ser Gregor Clegane's men, she is exposed to rape and murder on a regular basis. She is also abused and forced to work at Harrenhal, cleaning, serving men-at-arms at meals, and running errands for an under-steward name Weese, who beats her. When Jaqen H'ghar gives her the opportunity to kill three men, the first one she picks is a man-at-arms for Gregor Clegane named Chiswyck, because she overheard him telling a story, laughing about how he and Clegane's men had gang-raped an innkeeper's daughter. The second name she chooses is Weese. The TV series changed this so that instead, Arya chooses the Tickler and Amory Lorch, who are not killed by Jaqen in the book.

Arya's third and final choice was similar but somewhat condensed from what happened in the books. In the TV series, she asks Jaqen to help her escape, so he kills the Lannister guards. In the books, Arya asks Jaqen to help her free a large number of Northern prisoners-of-war who are being held at the castle. Jaqen refuses at first, then Arya chooses him as the third man to die. Jaqen asks her to change her choice, and she agrees on the condition that he helps her free the prisoners. He enlists the help of Rorge and Biter. They get large pots of boiling soup as the prisoners' dinner, but when they get to the dungeons, they throw the boiling-hot soup on the guards and slay them, free and arm the prisoners, and take Harrenhal from the Lannister forces. This is remembered as the "weasel soup" incident, because at the time, Arya was using the alias "Weasel" (naming herself after a little girl she took care of earlier in the book before being captured). Soon afterward, Jaqen leaves, after giving Arya the coin. He explains that if she ever needs to find him again, she should give the coin to any man from Braavos and say "valar morghulis."

Roose Bolton becomes the master of Harrenhal as a result, and Arya becomes his cupbearer. Arya does not leave because she feels safe with the Northern soldiers, but at the same time she still keeps her true identity secret because she isn't sure if she can trust them yet. She overhears Roose and his men discussing the fall of Winterfell and Bran and Rickon's deaths, and refuses to believe the news. Arya continues serving Roose until she finds out that he is leaving Harrenhal in the hands of Vargo Hoat, a particularly cruel sellsword, and that she will remain there with him. Unsure of what to do, she goes to the castle's godswood and prays to the old gods. The weirwood face responds to her with her father's voice, reminding her that she is Arya Stark and she must be strong. In response, she enacts her escape from Harrenhal, bringing along Gendry and Hot Pie, with the intention of reaching her family at Riverrun. She kills the guard at the gate to get out and they ride away on stolen horses.

Arya technically gained the title of "princess" when her brother Robb was declared the new King in the North. While her brothers Bran and Rickon use the title of "prince" among the Northerners at Winterfell, Arya's storyline takes her on the run through the Riverlands as it is torn apart in the war between the Starks and Lannisters, so that she is usually keeping her true name a secret, let alone her title. Thus she normally isn't referred to as "princess", or at least not in her surroundings. Robb, Catelyn, and the Freys refer to her as a "princess" when brokering their marriage-alliance.

Ironically, she meets her Frey husband-to-be (Elmar Frey) while serving under Roose Bolton, and he spends time talking at length to Arya about his promised princess, unknowingly speaking to her personally. He tries to boss Arya around, but she does not comply. After being informed that Robb breached the pact with the Freys, Elmar tells Arya whiningly that his father told him he had to marry someone else, or to become a septon. Arya tries to empathize with him, telling him two of her brothers are dead. But when he responds derisively, she loses all sympathy for him.

By this point in the novels, Arya is presumed dead by most people in Westeros, including her mother and older brother. Tyron tells his father that Varys and Jacelyn Bywater searched for her for more than half a year, but in vain. When Catelyn asks Cleos Frey, who has been acting as an envoy ferrying peace terms between Robb and Tyrion, for news of her daughters, she is disturbed when Cleos only mentions seeing Sansa at court. Catelyn wonders whether Arya, always more difficult to control than Sansa, is being deliberately kept out of sight by Cersei for fear of what she might do or say, or if something even worse has happened to her. The belief that Arya is dead, along with the news of the apparent deaths of Bran and Rickon, is what prompts Catelyn to release Jaime in the hope that her last daughter can be returned to her. Later, Robb bluntly states that his youngest sister is probably dead, since no one has seen her since their father's death, and as a result, he names his half-brother Jon Snow as his heir should he die without issue.

In the third novel, Arya leads Gendry and Hot Pie through the Riverlands in the hope of reaching Riverrun. They use a map she stole from Roose to guide them. Roose sends men after them, but when Arya sleeps, she wargs into Nymeria who attacks the men sent to capture Arya along with the giant wolf pack she now leads. While they're on their way, the Brotherhood Without Banners comes upon them and coerces them into coming with them to an inn that's used as one of the headquarters. Once there, outlaws plan on taking their horses and giving the three children over to the care of the innkeeper, with the promise of paying for the horses they're taking once the war is done. Arya attempts to negotiate with them, hoping to trade their horses for a boat they saw outside the inn. The arrival of more outlaws scares Arya into fighting to get away, only for her to realize one of the new outlaws is Harwin, a former member of the Stark Household guard. He reveals who she is to the Brotherhood and they take her in search of Beric Dondarrion, who will decide whether to ransom her. Arya parts with Hot Pie, who remains at the inn, but Gendry continues on with her.
