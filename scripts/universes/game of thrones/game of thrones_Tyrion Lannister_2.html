After days of confinement in the carriage, an impatient Tyrion eventually opts to get through Volantis on foot. The pair move through the Long Bridge's markets, where Varys explains the meaning of the various tattoos Volantene slaves must sport. Varys nearly loses Tyrion, but finds him observing the sermon of a Red Priestess. Tyrion says he is curious, since Thoros of Myr was the only Red Priest in King's Landing. The Red Priestess evangelizes in High Valyrian, telling the tale of how she was once a slave herself. She preaches of a prophesied savior, a Dragon Queen. Tyrion's interest in the scene wanes when the Priestess stares directly into his eyes.
Tyrion is captured by Jorah on a brothel in Volantis.
Tyrion next leads Varys to a brothel. Catching sight of a prostitute dressed as Daenerys, Varys tells Tyrion that a woman who inspires both sermons and whores is probably worth meeting. Tyrion woos a dark-haired prostitute, but when she finally agrees to service him, he finds that he can't bring himself to patronize her. He then goes to urinate off the side of the bridge, with Varys losing sight of him. As Tyrion finishes, he is abducted by Jorah Mormont, who declares that he is taking him to "the queen."

Tyrion is held hostage by Jorah.
Now at the mercy of his captor, Tyrion is thrown into a stolen boat by Jorah and they set sail for Meereen. En route, Tyrion pesters Jorah with muffled whining until he relents and removes Tyrion's gag. Tyrion notices that they are traveling east and not west towards Cersei in King's Landing. Jorah reveals that he is taking Tyrion to the queen he serves, Daenerys Targaryen. Tyrion is pleasantly surprised and tries to convince Jorah that they are on the same side since he was traveling to meet Daenerys anyway. He accurately deduces who Jorah is by his appearance and equipment, and correctly assumes that Jorah must have been banished by Daenerys because she discovered that he was spying on her for Varys. Tyrion mockingly asks Jorah if he really believes that he will earn a pardon for simply delivering him to Daenerys, believing the opposite outcome just as likely. Fed up with his captive, Jorah strikes Tyrion across the face to keep him quiet.

Tyrion travels through Old Valyria.
As Jorah and Tyrion continue their journey to Meereen, and following Jorah's violent reaction to a previous conversation, Tyrion tries to civilize their relationship and asks where they are. As Jorah stands up to look at the foggy ruins on the horizon, Tyrion deduces that they are going to pass through the remains of Old Valyria, a shorter route to Meereen and one which pirates will avoid because of Valyria's reputation. Tyrion is apprehensive, but still excited to see the ruins of what was once the greatest civilization in the world. As they catch glimpses of domes, towers and aqueducts, Tyrion recites a poem about the Doom of Valyria, with Jorah joining in at the end. Suddenly, through the fog, they see Drogon fly into view. Although he had been hearing about the dragons for some time, Tyrion is still awed to see one in person - though the beast does not notice them. 

Tyrion is attacked by Stone Men en route to Meereen.
They are suddenly attacked by Stone Men, men whose greyscale infection has reached its pinnacle and transformed them into feral monsters. During the fight, Tyrion falls overboard and dragged under by a stone man, but he is rescued by Jorah and they make it to a beach, where Tyrion regains consciousness. Jorah finally frees Tyrion from his binds and notices that none of the stone men managed to touch him. Tyrion thanks Jorah for saving his life, and they decide to seek out a fishing village to acquire another boat, or walk the rest of the way to Meereen. Jorah tells Tyrion to get some rest as he goes for firewood, but unbeknownst to Tyrion, Jorah has been infected with greyscale.

Tyrion tells Jorah about his father's death.
Tyrion and Jorah continue their quest to Meereen on foot. Tyrion is annoyed that they didn't find any villages to steal a boat or supplies from as Jorah had hoped, so they're slowly walking and only have berries and roots to eat. The topic of just why Tyrion was even in Volantis comes up, and Tyrion is surprised that Jorah did not ask earlier: he explains that he actually fled from Westeros because he killed his own father. He says he did it because his father tried to have him executed for a crime he didn't commit, and then he found his father screwing the woman he loved. Tyrion then says that despite how miserable Jorah is now, at least he can say that he had a good father. Jorah asks how he could have known his father Jeor Mormont, but Tyrion explains he visited the Wall once and met him: he was a great leader who seemed to genuinely care about all of his men, a rare thing in the world, but now as the eulogy for Night's Watch members goes, "the world will not see his like again." Jorah is shocked to realize he means that his father is dead. Tyrion becomes apologetic and says he thought that Jorah knew already. Jorah asks how he died: Tyrion says he only knows the report he heard, which said that his father led an expedition beyond the Wall, but there was a mutiny, and Jeor was murdered by his own men. Jorah processes this in silent grief, then changes the subject by saying that they have to keep moving.

Jorah and Tyrion are captured by slavers.
Tyrion openly questions Jorah's motives, and when Jorah claims that he came to believe in Daenerys when he saw her emerge from the fire unharmed with the dragon hatchlings, Tyrion is convinced, but still expresses doubt as to whether or not Daenerys will be a good ruler, given that her family was known for succumbing to madness due to their compound inbreeding, particularly her father, whom many still call the Mad King. However, they are spotted and captured by slavers bound for Volantis. The lead slaver, Malko, deems Tyrion as useless and orders his throat cut and his penis removed to be sold to a cock merchant (as he believes dwarf cocks bring good luck). Tyrion, however, convinces them to do it when they have reached the cock merchant, buying himself some time, and when Malko mentions that Daenerys has re-opened the fighting pits in Meereen, Tyrion successfully convinces Malko to take them to Meereen in order to put Jorah, who is a renowned Westerosi fighter, in the fighting pits and make them rich.

Tyrion convinces Yezzan to buy him.
On the outskirts of Meereen, after Jorah is sold to Yezzan zo Qaggaz, Tyrion attempts to convince Yezzan to buy him as well, and viciously beats his captor with his own chain to prove his worth. Yezzan relents and buys Tyrion, but mostly for his comedic value. They are taken to Daznak's pit, a small fighting pit, which will celebrate the opening of the games. When they hear that Daenerys is present, Jorah immediately enters the fight in the arena, while Tyrion struggles to cut his chain until a guard comes and does it for him. Tyrion enters the arena just as Jorah is being taken away (since Daenerys still hasn't forgiven him), and reveals himself as Jorah's "gift." He introduces himself as Tyrion Lannister, and meets Daenerys face-to-face at last.

Tyrion explains his family tensions to Daenerys.
Both Tyrion and Jorah are brought before Daenerys inside the Great Pyramid. Daenerys initially advocates executing Tyrion as revenge against the Lannisters for betraying her family, but Tyrion points out that he killed his mother in childbirth and shot his father in the heart before fleeing. She asks him advice on what to do with Jorah. Tyrion persuades her to spare him, but suggests banishing him again, since he did effectively betray her trust. 

Tyrion and Daenerys discussing matters of family and politics.
Later, while having wine, Tyrion and Daenerys agree that they both had cruel fathers, and Tyrion promises to explain why he killed Tywin someday, should she decide to spare him. Tyrion admits that though he believes Daenerys is no better than her father, he admits that he traveled to Meereen because Varys convinced him that she may very well be the best monarch for the Seven Kingdoms. He believes that Varys was correct in his assessment, and notes that Varys is the only person he can trust, aside from his brother Jaime. The mention of Jaime, who killed her father, prompts Daenerys to suggest executing Tyrion, but Tyrion reacts with indifference, claiming that he was ready to drink himself to death in Pentos and still welcomes death if Daenerys prefers it, given the rate of how his own life had become as of late. Daenerys ultimately decides not to kill or banish Tyrion, but to take him as an advisor on how to reclaim the Iron Throne. Tyrion suggests that Daenerys stay in Meereen, as she may do more good in Essos than in Westeros. Daenerys assures Tyrion that she will stay in Meereen to ensure there is no more slavery but states that Essos is not her home. Tyrion counters that no one will support her in Westeros, but Daenerys somewhat idealistically declares that the common people will support her.  
Tyrion generously assumes that this will happen (which it generally doesn't), but then he reminds Daenerys that Meereen has been in a state of chaos without the combined support of the Great Masters and the smallfolk, and extends this to Westeros and its Great Houses. He notes that Houses Targaryen and Stark are effectively dead or scattered due to the combined actions of their "two terrible fathers." Neither House Lannister nor House Baratheon of Dragonstone will ever support her claim in light of their histories with the Targaryens. Tyrion says that leaves House Tyrell, who originally sided with the Crown in Robert's Rebellion and might be willing to help her due to Cersei's recent schemes against them, but that it still isn't enough. Daenerys stubbornly likens the Great Houses, including her own House Targaryen, to spokes on a wheel: one on top of the others, and on and on, crushing the commoners beneath them in their struggle for supremacy. Tyrion sarcastically warns that others have dreamt of stopping the wheel, but Daenerys clarifies that she isn't planning to stop the wheel, she intends to break it.

Daenerys, Hizdahr and Tyrion discuss the brutality of tradition.
Tyrion attends the opening of the Great Games in Daznak's Pit along with Daenerys, Hizdahr zo Loraq, Daario Naharis, and Missandei. He playfully banters with Hizdahr and Daario about which fighters will win owing to what advantages, such as strength or speed, and after Hizdahr lectures Daenerys about the requisitions of holding onto power, Tyrion coldly quips that Tywin would have liked him. In the second round of the games, Jorah appears as one of the combatants and is almost killed. Tyrion urges Daenerys to stop the games before Jorah is killed, but he is saved by another fighter. 

Tyrion is left struck with awe as Daenerys escapes the pit on her dragon.
Suddenly, a surprise attack by the Sons of the Harpy devastates the fighting pit. Tyrion saves Missandei by killing one of the Sons and he runs with Daenerys and the others into the center of the fighting pit, where they are surrounded. He later watches in obvious shock when Drogon enters the pit and sets several Sons ablaze. When Daenerys flies off on Drogon's back, Tyrion is left struck with awe as he watches her fly through the sky on dragon back.

Jorah, Daario, and Tyrion lament the whereabouts of Daenerys.
In the aftermath, Tyrion sits in the throne room with Daario and Jorah. Grey Worm recovers and Missandei introduces him to Tyrion. Tyrion concludes that since Drogon flew North, he and Daario must head in that direction if they are to find Daenerys, getting into an argument with Jorah over his status as a Lannister and Jorah having betrayed and been exiled twice by Daenerys. Daario breaks up the argument, convincing Tyrion to trust Jorah and allow him to come, since he did save Daenerys in the fighting pit, but at the same time questions Tyrion's skills in tracking and combat and deeming him unfit to join in such a dangerous mission. Instead, Daario advises Tyrion to stay in Meereen and rule on Daenerys's behalf, knowing of his political skills from his time as Hand of the King, with Grey Worm enforcing Tyrion's rule with the Unsullied and Missandei as interpreter, wishing him luck on keeping the city together. 

Tyrion and Varys watch over Meereen
Later on, Tyrion, from atop the pyramid, watches Daario and Jorah depart Meereen to find Daenerys. He is joined by Varys, who playfully teases him for "abandoning" him and admits he found him through his little birds. Varys congratulates Tyrion for winning Daenerys's favor without him. Varys alludes to the political instability in Meereen, and the opportunities it presents for Tyrion. Through their bantering, they vow to help each other hold Meereen together. Tyrion then wholeheartedly admits that he missed Varys.

Season 6
Tyrion and Varys stroll the streets of Meereen.
In an effort to find the Sons of the Harpy, Tyrion and Varys explore the streets of Meereen disguised as merchants, believing they can do more at street level than inside the Great Pyramid. Upon meeting a woman and her baby, Tyrion offers some money to feed her child. Due to his bad Valyrian, however, she refuses, believing Tyrion intends to eat her baby until Varys corrects her. While pondering their predicament and what Daenerys' absence means to the people of Meereen, they witness Zanrush preaching to some of the former slaves to fight for their own freedom instead of relying on Daenerys. After surmising that the Harpies have a leader, Tyrion and Varys encounter several citizens running away from something. Investigating the disturbance, they are shocked to find that the Sons of the Harpy have burned every ship in the harbor.

Tyrion decides to visit Viserion and Rhaegal.
Later, in the Great Pyramid, Tyrion learns that the Unsullied have yet to find the person responsible for burning the Meereenese fleet, Astapor and Yunkai have fallen back into the slave trade and Daenerys' remaining dragons haven't been eating since their mother left. Tyrion guesses that they are morose because they are in captivity. When Missandei asks how he knows this, he replies, "That's what I do. I drink and I know things." Tyrion decides to meet the dragons and free them, knowing they will be better off this way.  

Accompanied by Varys, Tyrion ventures alone into the catacombs and encounters Viserion and Rhaegal for the first time. Despite their initial hostility towards him, Tyrion remains calm, assuring them he is a friend of Daenerys and only wants to help. He manages to earn their trust and unshackle them, all the while telling them the story of how he wanted a dragon for his nameday when asked by his uncle what he'd like for a gift, only to be disappointed by uproarious laughter from his family and the truth from his father, that they'd been extinct for a century. After the dragons depart, Tyrion quickly exits the pit with Varys, asking the eunuch to punch him 'in the face' the next time he has a crazy idea.

Tyrion tries to initiate small talk with Missandei and Grey Worm.
Later, while waiting for Varys as he turns one of the Sons of the Harpy's allies to their cause, Tyrion tries to pass the time with Missandei and Grey Worm by engaging in small talk and playing one of his drinking games, without success. Once Varys arrives, Tyrion learns that the Masters of Yunkai, Astapor and Volantis are collectively funding the Sons of the Harpy. In order to intimidate the Masters into backing down, Tyrion asks Varys to arrange a meeting with them.

Tyrion invites Daenerys's enemies to Meereen.
Tyrion, Grey Worm, Missandei and Varys prepare to meet with representatives of the Good Masters of Astapor, the Wise Masters of Yunkai, and the slave-trading city of Volantis, who have all arrived by sea. As the diplomatic mission enters the harbor, Grey Worm advocates using military force, though Tyrion reminds him this has already been tried, and this time they must "make peace with our enemies." When Tyrion explains that he is able to empathize with slaves because he spent one day as a slave, Missandei counters that he has not experienced slavery enough.

Tyrion discusses negotiations with the slave masters.
In the meeting chamber, the emissaries are revealed to be Tyrion's former slave master Yezzan zo Qaggaz, the Yunkai'i Wise Master Razdal mo Eraz, and the Volantene representative Belicho Paenymion. Yezzan remarks at how Tyrion, a dwarf slave, has quickly climbed to the top of the Great Pyramid. The slave-trading cities offer to give Daenerys and her allies a large amount of money and ships if they leave Slaver's Bay. When Missandei defends Dany's actions in liberating slaves, Razdal contends that slavery has existed in the region for centuries. After hearing their offer and reminding them there are other ways to make money, Tyrion proposes a counter-offer. While Meereen would remain a free city, he offers to give the other cities of Slaver's Bay a seven-year time limit to phase out slavery and compensate all slave owners. However, they must end all support for the Sons of the Harpy, regardless of their denial of it. He then cautions them that they will not get a better offer. At the meeting's conclusion, Tyrion gives them a trio of prostitutes and time to consider his offer. 

Tyrion and his entourage are later confronted by a group of former slaves in the Meereen throne room. A freedman demands to know when Daenerys will return, while another is appalled at the idea of Tyrion negotiating with slave traders. Tyrion insists he is doing his best to rule the city in her absence while they wait. Instead, the freedmen refuse to listen to the foreign dwarf and look to Grey Worm and Missandei for reassurance. Despite their misgivings, they both publicly back Tyrion in front of the freedmen.

In private, Tyrion assures Missandei and Grey Worm that he is serving Daenerys' interest by taking advantage of the Masters' own arrogance, but that he cannot end slavery overnight. Grey Worm, however, warns Tyrion that the slavers cannot be reasoned with and will most likely take advantage of him instead, since they already do it for a living.

Tyrion acquires religious support.
Nevertheless, the situation in Meereen begins to stabilize, with almost no incidents involving the Freedmen or Sons of the Harpy, though Tyrion reminds them they need to convince the Meereenese that everything has been done with Daenerys' blessing, as the Masters could use Tyrion and Varys' foreign status against them to fully reclaim Slaver's Bay. To accomplish this, Tyrion invites Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, to negotiate spreading the word of Daenerys's achievements. To Tyrion's surprise, Kinvara appears to fully agree with supporting Tyrion's goals, believing that Daenerys is The Prince That Was Promised. Varys is more skeptical, however, being suspicious of any practitioners of magic, and points out that Melisandre had already promised the same to Stannis Baratheon, who was ultimately defeated and killed. Kinvara counters that the Lord of Light's human followers occasionally make mistakes, then shuts him down with knowledge of his castration. Kinvara then assures Tyrion that she will send the preachers and priests best suited to the task at hand.

Tyrion bids Varys farewell.
When the Red Priests arrive at Meereen to preach about Daenerys, Tyrion and Varys are debating if their presence can maintain order throughout the city while walking through the markets. Afterwards, Varys tells Tyrion that he is leaving on a secret expedition because Daenerys will need more allies, before Tyrion proclaims to Varys that he is the most famous dwarf in the world.

In the Great Pyramid, Tyrion wishes to celebrate with Missandei and Grey Worm for the resurgence of Meereen and to honor their queen. Their celebration is cut short when a large fleet of slaver ships lay siege to the city. As the slavers continue to bombard Meereen, Tyrion allows Grey Worm to assume command. Grey Worm proposes that the Unsullied must not go to the beach, preferring to wait until the slavers enter the Great Pyramid. At that moment, they hear movement on the roof. When they go to investigate, they discover that Daenerys has returned on her dragon Drogon.

The following day, Tyrion explains the events in Meereen during her absence to Daenerys. Despite the fact that they are under siege by the Masters' fleet, he believes that his success in bringing about a resurgence of a slaveless Meereen is the reason for their attack, because the Masters could not let such an example succeed for fear that their slaves could rise up. Daenerys declares that she will destroy the Masters' armies, kill them all, and destroy their cities. Tyrion disapproves and explains the similarities between this plan and the one her father had for King's Landing when the Lannisters were at his door. Instead, he proposes a different solution.

Tyrion joins Daenerys in negotiations.
Accompanied by Grey Worm and Missandei, Tyrion and Daenerys meet with the slave masters Razdal, Yezzan, and Belicho to parley. Believing victory is near, the slave masters demand that Daenerys and Tyrion surrender Missandei and the Unsullied to their masters, and her three dragons to be slaughtered before leaving Slaver's Bay. Dany rejects their terms and orders Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal to burn the slavers' fleet. As Dany leads the counterattack on the back of Drogon, Tyrion chastises the slave masters for breaking his pact and demands that they surrender one of their own to be executed as punishment. When Razdal and Belicho try to offer up Yezzan, Tyrion orders Grey Worm to kill the two masters. However, he spares Yezzan so Yezzan can spread the word of Daenerys's power. Meanwhile, Dany's Dothraki horde wipes out the resurgent Sons of the Harpy.

After the battle, Tyrion is present at the Great Pyramid while Dany holds an audience with Yara and Theon Greyjoy, who have just arrived in Meereen with most of the Iron Fleet. Knowing Theon, Tyrion chides him for mocking his height back at Winterfell and for the alleged murders of Bran and Rickon Stark. A penitent Theon reiterates that he has paid for his crimes though Tyrion is incredulous given that Theon is standing there. Yara offers to provide Daenerys with a hundred ships if she helps them to defeat her uncle Euron Greyjoy and recognizes the independence of the Iron Islands. Tyrion protests that if the Iron Islands gain independence, then the rest of the Kingdoms will likely make that demand as well; Dany states that they are welcome to try, and agrees to Yara's terms, provided that the Ironborn end all reaving and piracy of the mainland. When Yara begrudgingly accepts, Tyrion indicates his approval of the alliance, as Daenerys has negotiated a strong position for herself.

Dany and Tyrion discuss her lack of sentimentality.

In preparation for the invasion of Westeros and entering its politics, Tyrion advises Daenerys to end her relationship with Daario and leave him Meereen with the rest of the Second Sons, which she does. Tyrion attempts to console her on her loss of the relationship but admits he is not good at consoling. She agrees but she says she is more bothered that it was so easy for her to let Daario go than by the actual loss of the relationship. Tyrion tells her that Daario is not the only man she ever loved and definitely will not be the last. He also implies that she already has the needed mind set for the terrifying game she is about to play with the lords of Westeros.
Daenerys makes Tyrion her Hand.
Tyrion goes on to admit that for years he has believed in nothing but, in the months in her service, he has come to believe in Daenerys and that he is ready to live again. Touched, Daenerys presents him with a replica of the Hand's brooch and formally names him Hand of the Queen. Moved to near-tears, Tyrion kneels before her. Some time later, Tyrion stands with Daenerys on the flagship of her massive armada, looking ahead to returning to Westeros.

Season 7
News of Tyrion's appointment as Hand to Daenerys has also reached King's Landing, news which Cersei breaks to Jaime when they make a list of their enemies.

Tyrion arrives on Dragonstone.
Tyrion arrives on Dragonstone, accompanied by Daenerys, Missandei, Varys, and Grey Worm. He follows Daenerys from the shore of the island to the Painted Table of Westeros, pulling down the standard of Stannis Baratheon and running her hands along the simplistically ornate throne before asking if they can begin planning her conquest.

As they begin planning for the conquest of Westeros, Tyrion cautions Daenerys not to launch a direct assault on the city with her dragons or she will merely become Queen of the ashes, to which Daenerys concurs. Tyrion witnesses as Daenerys calls into question Varys's allegiance, as his loyalty has shifted from king to king since the days when he served her father. The Hand tries to defend his friend, insisting that Varys had been the one to convince him over to their cause and that he had served her well since then, assisting his rule of Meereen and securing the alliance of Dorne and House Tyrell. However, Daenerys demands that Varys explain himself without support from Tyrion, who watches as the Spider swears that he will be loyal to her as long as she keeps the people's best interests at heart. Daenerys requests that Varys not conspire against her if she should fail and that he try his hardest to dissuade her.

Grey Worm announces the arrival of Melisandre, who brings them news of events in the North and Jon Snow's coronation as King, to Tyrion's surprise. Although somewhat skeptical of Melisandre's prophecies, Tyrion admits that he liked and trusted Jon's character when they traveled to the Wall together, and encourages Daenerys to make an alliance with him.

Tyrion clashes with Ellaria during Daenerys's council meeting.
Tyrion later joins Daenerys for a council of war with Missandei, Varys, Grey Worm, Olenna Tyrell, the Greyjoy siblings and Ellaria Sand. Tyrion initially clashes with Ellaria, as he knows she poisoned his niece Myrcella and she blames him indirectly for Oberyn's death. After Daenerys stops their argument, Tyrion helps her explain their plan to invade Westeros: as Cersei is trying to rally the Lords to defend King's Landing against a foreign army, Daenerys' Unsullied and Dothraki will not attack the city or they will "prove her point."

Tyrion explains his tactics.
Instead, the Greyjoy fleet will ferry the Dornish army north to lay siege to King's Landing alongside the Tyrell forces, trapping Cersei and most of her army in the capitol and starving them out. Meanwhile, in response to Olenna's question of the use of Daenerys's foreign soldiers, Tyrion plans to have the Unsullied sail around Westeros and capture Casterly Rock, the true seat of House Lannister's power. Ellaria, Yara Greyjoy and Olenna agree to follow this plan. All does not go as planned, however; on their way to Dorne, Yara's fleet is decimated by her uncle Euron's Iron Fleet, and both she and Ellaria are captured.

Tyrion meets with Jon Snow, now King in the North.
Tyrion is later seen meeting with Jon Snow, Davos Seaworth, and their men, as they arrive in a small boat onto the shores of Dragonstone. Tyrion teases Jon, calling him "the bastard of Winterfell", to which Jon retorts, calling Tyrion "the dwarf of Casterly Rock." They greet each other warmly and seem to be happy to see each other again, exchanging friendly barbs back and forth. Jon and his party are then forced to surrender their weapons, and they reluctantly do so. Then, as the party is escorted towards the castle, a group of Daenerys' soldiers whisk away their boat. Jon and Davos exchange looks of concern at this.

Tyrion escorts the Northern party to Daenerys.
As they make their way up the castle steps, Jon and Tyrion have a conversation about how they got to their respective positions, and how Jon's followers must think he's crazy for going to Dragonstone. Tyrion concurs, stating that if he were Jon's advisor, he would have advised against it, and cites that going south doesn't usually work out well for the Starks, to which Jon swiftly replies that he is not a Stark. They are then suddenly interrupted when Drogon swoops down towards them, and everyone is forced to duck for cover. Jon takes a moment to recover from the sudden shock, as the party continues on their journey towards the castle.

Daenerys's forward nature towards Jon worries Tyrion.
As they reach the throne room, Jon and Davos begin to speak with Daenerys as Tyrion watches by her side. The meeting is very tense as both sides refuse to submit to the other's demands. Tyrion plays an important moderating role by vouching for Jon's integrity and character, helping to soften Daenerys' attitude towards the insistent and unbowing King in the North. As the meeting is about to end on an unfavorable note, Tyrion urges Jon to simply bend the knee, reasoning that if Westeros is doomed by the threat of White Walkers, it makes no difference who he supports for the Iron Throne, especially if it will help him further his goals.

Tyrion speaks with Jon in private.
The meeting is interrupted by Varys who delivers news about their decimated Greyjoy fleet. Dany allows Jon and Davos to stay as "guests" until they can reach a proper agreement. Later, Tyrion meets with Jon on the grounds of Dragonstone. Jon is unhappy that he is a prisoner while the Night King and White Walkers still pose a threat. Tyrion encourages a despondent Jon not to give up and confides that he trusts the word of Jon and Jeor Mormont. Tyrion also vouches for his Queen and reassures Jon that she is not like her father. Tyrion also asks Jon if there is something he can do to help. Jon tells Tyrion about the vein of dragonglass beneath Dragonstone.

Tyrion manages to convince a skeptical Dany to allow Jon to mine the dragon glass on the pretext that it will win her an ally. Dany grants Jon permission to mine the dragon glass and outfits him with the manpower and equipment to do so. At the Chamber of the Painted Table, Tyrion along with Varys and Missandei discuss Euron Greyjoy's destruction of Yara's fleet. Tyrion and Missandei argue against Daenerys' plan to lead her dragons on a mission to hunt and destroy Euron's fleet, opining that she faces the prospect of death. Tyrion then elaborates his plan to seize Casterly Rock using an underground tunnel. Grey Worm uses this tunnel to capture Casterly Rock, only to discover that the Lannisters have withdrawn the bulk of their forces. Euron's Iron Fleet attacks the Targaryen ships, trapping the Unsullied at Casterly Rock.

Varys and Tyrion inform Daenerys that the Unsullied succeeded in capturing Casterly Rock, only to then reveal the disaster which just occurred at Highgarden as Tyrion's military strategy fell apart. Daenerys is furious and struggles to keep her temper, as now all three of her major allies in Westeros are gone and all she has gained is a castle with no supplies. She snaps at Tyrion, blaming his cautious strategy for losing them Dorne, the Iron Islands (Yara's forces), and now the Reach. She then accuses Tyrion of wanting to use a light hand against the Lannisters because they're his own people. Tyrion insists that they still have just enough ships left to at least shuttle the Dothraki from Dragonstone to the nearby mainland coast; even with the loss of all her other allies, her combined Unsullied/Dothraki forces are still the largest single army in Westeros. Daenerys fumes that her vast numbers are useless if she can't feed them all, as that was the Reach's true strategic value. Daenerys decides she has had enough of clever plans, declaring she will use the Dothraki and her dragons in a direct assault on the Red Keep to destroy her enemies. Tyrion urges her against this and when Daenerys asks Jon Snow for his input, he agrees with Tyrion to not attack King's Landing.

Tyrion watches as Jaime is almost killed.
Daenerys decides to attack the Lannister army en route to King's Landing following their victory at the Sack of Highgarden, which would destroy expenses retrieved in the process, atop Drogon. Tyrion is present when she attacks the Lannister forces outside King's Landing during the Battle of the Goldroad, watching miserable as the Dothraki massacre his kinsmen. When Drogon is injured and is forced to land, Tyrion watches in horror as Jaime foolishly charges at Daenerys on the battlefield and nearly incinerated by Drogon, before being saved by Bronn.

Tyrion stands by Daenerys's side during her judgment over the Lannister and Tarly ranks.
In the aftermath of the battle, Tyrion examines the damage on the battlefield and is present when Daenerys offers the surviving Lannister and Tarly men a choice: kneel or die. When Randyll Tarly refuses, Tyrion is quick to point out Randyll's newfound loyalty to Cersei, despite her role in annihilating House Tyrell. Randyll, in turn, denounces Tyrion and his loyalty to Daenerys, viewing her as a foreign invader. Despite Tyrion's insistence that Randyll and Dickon Tarly be imprisoned or sent to the Wall, Daenerys ignores his advice, explaining that they already made their choice, and orders Drogon to burn them alive.

Tyrion discusses the Battle of the Goldroad with Varys.
Back at Dragonstone, Tyrion discusses the aftermath of the battle with Varys. Though confident that Daenerys is not her father, Varys suggests that Tyrion find a way to make her listen to his advice. When Tyrion notices a message in his hand, Varys says that it is for Jon. At Daenerys' subsequent council meeting, Tyrion suggests capturing a Wight north of the Wall and bringing it back to Cersei as proof of their true common enemy. To convince Cersei to stand down, however, he must first appeal to Jaime. Davos agrees to smuggle Tyrion into King's Landing, but warns him of the consequences should the gold cloaks recognize him.

Tyrion reunites with Jaime.
Arriving at a secluded beach close to the Red Keep, Tyrion remarks that he murdered his own father the last time he was in King's Landing, with Davos remarking that Tyrion murdered his son the last time he visited the city. With time short, Tyrion makes his way inside. In the cellar beneath the Red Keep, Bronn arranges the meeting in the guise of a secret sparring session. Tyrion commends Jaime for outsmarting him at the siege of Casterly Rock, then does his best to explain his true motivations for murdering their father. When Jaime demands to know the real reason for the meeting, Tyrion explains that though Daenerys' victory is inevitable, she is genuinely nothing like her father, and has a more important request for Cersei.

Upon returning to the beach, Tyrion spots two Gold Cloaks near Davos's boat, and is spotted in return. Before the guards can arrest him, however, Davos's companion quickly dispatches them. After Tyrion is introduced to Gendry, the three make their escape. Tyrion later reunites with Jorah Mormont, his former traveling companion, and reminisces over their journey to Meereen, after which Tyrion gives Jorah the coin used to pay for him by Yezzan, hoping it will bring him luck for the Wight Hunt.

Tyrion says Jon is in love with Dany.
Later, he and Daenerys discuss heroism, Daenerys telling him he is no hero. Tyrion disagrees, and tries to explain how he received his scar by charging through the Mud Gate. Daenerys interrupts him, stating she doesn't want him to be a hero, as they do stupid things and end up dead. She names Drogo, Daario Naharis, Jorah Mormont and Jon Snow as examples, which Tyrion notes, stating all four of these men fell in love with her. Daenerys says Jon Snow doesn't love her, to which Tyrion responds sarcastically he only stares at her longingly because he is hopeful for a successful military alliance. When Daenerys calls Jon too little for her, Tyrion says that as far as heroes go, he is quite little. Daenerys then says she knows Tyrion is brave, as she wouldn't have chosen a coward as her hand.

Daenerys and Tyrion discuss the usage of fear.
Daenerys changes the subject, by saying if the Wight Hunt goes well, she'll finally get to meet Cersei, who wants to kill her. Tyrion notes that she would probably torture her first. He vows that if they go to the capital, they will go with the full capacity of their forces, and if someone even touches her, they'll burn the city to the ground. Daenerys says she's probably planning a trap, but Tyrion notes that Cersei is probably thinking the very same thing about Daenerys. When Daenerys asks him if they should lay a trap, Tyrion says it would be better to build a new world without mass murder. Daenerys remarks that no war was won without it, which Tyrion agrees but states that fear alone isn't the right way of ruling.

Tyrion tells Daenerys of his loyalty to her.
When Dany says Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way with fear, Tyrion reminds her of her promise of breaking the wheel, which Aegon built. Tyrion then speaks about his meeting with Jaime, where he promised to keep the Lannister's forces in check if Tyrion makes sure Daenerys doesn't lose her temper. Daenerys responds she does not lose her temper, to which Tyrion replies she lost it when she killed the Tarlys. She notes that Tyrion takes his family's side once again. Tyrion says he has to, as the only way to beat them is to think like them.

Tyrion discusses children with Daenerys.
He states that he wants to serve Daenerys for the long term, and wants to make sure that, after she is Queen and broken the wheel, it stays broken after her death. He states that Daenerys once said she believes she can't have children, but that there are other ways to name an heir. Daenerys says he's been thinking of her death for quite a while, and angrily reminds him they lost Dorne and Highgarden because of his lack of planning for the short term. Tyrion remains silent as Daenerys says they will discuss this further after she is Queen.

Tyrion tries to stop Daenerys from going beyond the Wall.
When Daenerys receives a letter from Gendry, asking for help with the Wight Hunt gone wrong, Tyrion tries to stop her from going to the Wall with her dragons, saying she is the most important person in the world, and she can't go to the most dangerous place in the world. He claims the group knew the risk when they left, and Daenerys shouldn't try to save them. When she steps on Drogon, she asks him what he would have her do. Tyrion says that doing nothing is the hardest thing to do, but if she dies, everything and everyone would be lost. Daenerys reminds him he told her to do nothing once, and having learned the hard way, she won't do this again. Tyrion looks at her as she and her dragons dive off the cliff, heading for the wall.
After Cersei agrees to a summit in the Dragonpit at King's Landing, Tyrion and Jon arrive in the capitol with their various allies, while the Unsullied and the Dothraki amass outside the city walls to attack in case the truce gets broken.  At the harbor, Tyrion, Varys, Missandei, Jon and Davos nervously sail past Euron Greyjoy's fleet.

Tyrion leads the Targaryen entourage to the Dragonpit.

The group arrives and are escorted to the Dragonpit, the location of the summit. Tyrion reconnects with Bronn, who concedes it is good to see him again. The pair greet Podrick Payne, who had arrived earlier with Brienne of Tarth. Tyrion reminds Podrick that he is no longer a Westerosi noble after killing Tywin and Bronn that he will always pay more than what Cersei will in return for his service. Bronn rebuffs this, stating that if anything goes wrong during the parley, Cersei will have Bronn to thank for delivering her enemies to King's Landing.
Tyrion speaks to Cersei at the parley.
When Cersei arrives, she glares hatefully at Tyrion and quickly grows impatient that Daenerys has not come with him - only for Daenerys herself to make a dramatic arrival on dragonback moments later. Tyrion opens the negotiations, but is quickly interrupted by Euron Greyjoy, who mocks him and threatens Theon until Jaime and Cersei shut him down. Tyrion points out that if all they wanted to do was fight each other to the death, they would never have agreed to this meeting. Jon Snow then reveals the threat posed by the Night King and the Army of the Dead. Although Daenerys promises to uphold a truce with the Lannisters until the Night King has been dealt with, Cersei dismisses their claim concerning the Army of the Dead, saying they are simply attempting to strengthen their position while she is standing down. Tyrion replies that they have something to show her, and Sandor Clegane brings out the wight that was captured north of the Wall. Shaken by what she sees, Cersei at first seems willing to accept a truce, but only if Jon Snow agrees to have the North remain neutral and support neither Queen. To Tyrion's dismay, Jon replies that he cannot do so, as he has already declared for Daenerys. In response, Cersei leaves the summit. Furious, Tyrion rebukes Jon for not being able to make a small lie in order to secure them a political and military advantage. He declares that he will go and speak with Cersei alone - despite Daenerys's protests that she will have him murdered - or else they will be right back where they started.

Jaime warns Tyrion of Cersei.
Tyrion is escorted into the Tower of the Hand by Gregor Clegane; he meets Jaime outside, who claims he tried to reason with Cersei until she threw him out. Tyrion then meets Cersei inside the same office both he and their father once occupied, as Hand of the King. Cersei accuses him of having tried to bring down House Lannister from the very beginning. Although she finally acknowledges that Tyrion did not kill Joffrey, she reminds him that he did kill their father, and holds him responsible for the deaths of her other children, as she believed no one would have touched Tommen or Myrcella while Tywin was alive. Tyrion truthfully claims he was unaware of Jon's bending the knee to Daenerys and expresses sincere regret for the deaths of his nephew and niece, but Cersei does not care, claiming he destroyed their House's future regardless of his intentions. Angered, Tyrion tries to goad her into having him killed, if she blames him for everything that has befallen her. Cersei looks ready to give the order to Ser Gregor, but reluctantly relents. Tyrion wonders why she allowed him to arrange the peace negotiations in the first place if she didn't expect anything to happen; Cersei turns the question back at him, wondering why he supports Daenerys as loyally as he does. Cersei dismisses Tyrion's assertions that Daenerys is better at controlling her violent impulses than she is. She expresses the horror she felt when she saw the wight, and her desire to keep her loved ones safe from them at any cost. From this and her gestures, Tyrion correctly deduces that she is pregnant with another incestuous child by Jaime.

Tyrion then returns to his allies at the Dragonpit, where they are joined shortly after by his brother and sister. Cersei claims she will agree to the truce and send the Lannister forces north to fight alongside the Starks and the Targaryens. After a discussion at Dragonstone over their journey to the North, Tyrion accompanies his Queen and Jon Snow aboard a ship that will take them to White Harbor. On the voyage, Tyrion witnesses Daenerys allowing Jon into her cabin, where the two of them give in to their mutual attraction and engage in a sexual encounter. Concerned with the possible political consequences for his Queen, Tyrion walks away.

Season 8
Tyrion drinks with Jaime before the impending battle.
Cersei tasks Bronn with eliminating her brothers if they survive the war against the White Walkers. Tyrion reaches Winterfell along with Targaryen forces, in order to assist the North in the Great War. When the Northern lords are angry with Jon for giving up his crown to Daenerys, Tyrion speaks up for Jon, saying his efforts managed to secure them the "greatest army the world has ever seen" to defeat the Night King. However, when Tyrion reveals they allied with Lannister forces, their anger erupts again.

Tyrion finds Sansa for the first time since they last saw each other at Joffrey's wedding and note each other's new titles/ Tyrion calls the wedding "a miserable affair", though Sansa sardonically remarks, "It had its moments." She calls Tyrion out for believing that Cersei will honor the pledge to send the Lannister forces north. She is disappointed in Tyrion, saying she used to think Tyrion was the cleverest man she ever met.

Several days later, Jaime arrives at Winterfell after realizing Cersei wasn't sending her forces to assist them. Tyrion vouches for Jaime, saying he knows him. Daenerys replies, "Like your sister?" but Tyrion explains Jaime came anyway, knowing how he'd be received. Daenerys is furious with Tyrion for not expecting Cersei's betrayal, but is mollified by Jorah. While preparing for the battle, Tyrion, Podrick, Jaime, Brienne of Tarth, Tormund and Davos Seaworth engage in drinking, with Jaime knighting Brienne. Tyrion watches the White Walkers' arrival from the battlements of Winterfell.

Tyrion celebrates the defeat of the dead.
Tyrion survives the Battle of Winterfell and some time later, he mocks Jaime for sleeping with a bigger woman. They are, however, caught unawares by Bronn, who has been sent by Cersei to kill both her brothers. Tyrion has his nose busted by Bronn who hesitates to kill them, believing Daenerys still has a good chance of winning, and states he has been promised Riverrun as a reward. Tyrion reminds him of his promise to double the price anyone paid to murder him, and promises to make him the Lord of Highgarden after the war, upon which he relents.

Tyrion attempts to parley with Cersei.
He later takes part in planning the Battle of King's Landing. He, along with Jon and others, convinces Daenerys in besieging the city instead of using the dragons. After learning of Jon's true parentage from Sansa, he informs Varys about it. All hopes for a peaceful surrender are quickly dashed, after the Iron Fleet's ambush and Cersei having Missandei executed, even though Tyrion begs Cersei to surrender, for the sake of her unborn child.

Tyrion bids farewell to Varys.
While King's Landing is being besieged by the Unsullied, Tyrion returns along with the Queen to Dragonstone. When Jon returns to the Island, Tyrion overhears Varys pleading with him to take the Iron Throne and informs Daenerys about it, though he unsuccessfully begs for forgiveness for the Spider. Tyrion tells Varys he was behind his betrayal being discovered, and bids a final goodbye to him, before he is burnt alive by Drogon.

Tyrion watches in horror as King's Landing is destroyed.
Daenerys, who now believes she can only win Westeros through fear, is seemingly persuaded by Tyrion to stop attacking once King's Landing surrenders. She informs Tyrion that Jaime had been captured while trying to sneak into the city, warning him not to fail her again or it will be the last time. Before the Battle of King's Landing, Tyrion secretly releases Jaime. He convinces him to try to convince Cersei to have the city surrender and flee with her to Pentos to start a new life, for the sake of their unborn child. He also tearfully thanks Jaime for being the only family member to treat him with love and not as a monster, before the brothers hug. However, Tyrion's plan is foiled when after the city surrenders, Daenerys has Drogon burn King's Landing and raze over the Red Keep, killing Cersei and Jamie in the process. Tyrion stares in absolute horror at the untold destruction of the city. 

Tyrion wanders through the ruined King's Landing.

Tyrion decides to go to the Red Keep alone and goes down to the cellars where he discovers the dead bodies of his siblings and tears up. After Daenerys finishes her speech on liberating the whole world, she confronts Tyrion about him freeing his brother. In response, he states that she slaughtered a whole city, and removes his Hand of the Queen brooch before throwing it away in disgust. Daenerys, furious at a further betrayal, orders him arrested.
