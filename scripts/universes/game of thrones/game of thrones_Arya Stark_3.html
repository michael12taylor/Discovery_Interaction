<html><p>In the books, Arya describes Gendry as her "only true friend." The two form some bond after Arya entrusts Gendry with her true identity, though Arya was ready to kill him. Although their relationship in the novels is platonic, there are several hints the point towards a romantic relationship. Arya becomes jealous when Bella, a prostitute, offers to have sex with Gendry, who rejects this offer. Gendry also becomes jealous when Edric Dayne shows interest in Arya, which is heightened by their class difference. There is also a love song that only appears once in the series, which is after Arya and Gendry playfully wrestle in the forge. The TV series didn't overtly play up a full-fledged "romance" between the two, though Gendry becomes one of Arya's few friends and, as in the novels, she is pained when he chooses to stay behind with the Brotherhood.

As they travel in search of Beric, Arya sees more of the results of war in the Riverlands and meets other branches of the Brotherhood. During their stay in a town, another member of the Brotherhood captures the Hound and it is decided that he will be brought before Beric as well to receive judgement. Once they reach the Hollow Hill where Beric is hiding, the Hound insists that he is innocent of all the crimes thrown at him. But Arya insists that he is guilty of the murder of Mycah. Beric fights him in a trial by combat and loses to the Hound. Thus, the Brotherhood lets the Hound go, but takes his gold to buy food for the smallfolk. Arya is furious that he is allowed to go free even though he is guilty. The Hound follows the Brotherhood after they leave the Hollow Hill on their journey to take Arya to Riverrun, and confronts them demanding his money back. They refuse and continue on their journey.

The group stops at High Heart where a woods witch known as the Ghost of High Heart looks at Arya closely (in the show she is replaced with Melisandre). She becomes frightened and whimpers: "I see you, wolf child. Blood child. I thought it was the lord who smelled of death... you are cruel to come to my hill, cruel. I gorged on grief at Summerhall, I need none of yours. Begone from here, dark heart. Begone!." Arya wonders if the woman is mad. She also gives them other prophecies, among them about the Red Wedding and Catelyn's resurrection. When they move away from High Heart, Thoros looks in his flames and sees that Catelyn isn't at Riverrun and there is something dangerous happening that they don't understand. They plan to take Arya to Brynden Tully instead, at which point she angrily runs off, devastated that the Brotherhood prevented her from reaching Riverrun while he mother was still there.

At this point, the Hound, who had continued to follow the Brotherhood, captures her, planning to get her to the Twins so he can collect her ransom from Robb. When they reach the Twins, the wedding is already over and the feast has commenced. Before they can get very far, the Freys and Boltons begin attacking the loyal Northerners. Arya attempts to get into the castle anyway in the hopes of rescuing Catelyn, but the Hound knocks her out and carries her off. When she wakes, Arya insists on going back for her mother, but the Hound refuses. When Arya wargs into Nymeria again while she sleeps, she finds Catelyn's body in the river and pulls her out. This allows her to accept that her mother is dead and Arya goes into a depression. The Hound plans to take her to the Eyrie to sell her to Lysa Arryn, but he is warned against due to how dangerous it would be to travel through the Vale unprotected.

When Arya learns of Joffrey's death in the novels, she is not happy about it, not because she wasn't the one to kill him or watch as she wishes in the TV series, but because Joffrey's death doesn't matter as much since Robb was dead too. Also, in the novels, Arya and the Hound do not encounter Brienne and Pod, nor do they encounter Rorge and Biter. At the Crossroads Inn, Arya and The Hound fight Polliver, the Tickler and a Sarsfield squire. Arya kills the Tickler (who is assassinated at Harrenhal by Jaqen in the series) and the squire, but it is the Hound who kills Polliver. The Hound is severely injured during the fight, his wounds fester and he falls from his horse. After this, Arya refuses to give him a merciful death, and leaves him to die on his own. She does not take his silver (but later wishes she had). She rides to the Saltpans and searches for a ship that will take her to Jon at the Wall. All she can find is a ship headed to Braavos, which she boards using the coin Jaqen gave her.

In A Feast for Crows, once she arrives in Braavos, Arya is escorted to the House of Black and White, where she searches for Jaqen and a safe place to stay. Instead of another man posing as Jaqen, she is greeted by a figure she can only identify as the "kindly man." The coin she presents gains her entry into initiation training with the Faceless Men.

The kindly man tells Arya the House of Black and White is not a home for orphans, and if she wants to remain - she must be obedient at all times and in all things. They can find better jobs and places for her, like a service in the household of some merchant; they can find her a husband of her choice; or send her to train to become a courtesan; they can give her passage back to Westeros. Arya insists on staying.

At the kindly man's demand, Arya dissociates herself of her past and possessions. The only thing she keeps is Needle which she views as her connection to her family and home. She hides the sword with the intention of reclaiming it one day. She performs various chores at the House, spending much time with the Waif and Umma the cook. One day, the kindly man orders Arya to work for a fishmonger named Brusco, in order to master the Braavosi tongue. During her first tasks, Arya struggles to abandon her previous identity, trying to use new names such as Cat of the Canals.

While working for Brusco, she befriends a lot of people, learns to master the Braavosi language, and hears many secrets. Occasionally she returns to the House and tells the kindly man three new things she learned - gossip, rumors, interesting pieces of information, professional secrets, etc. The work is hard, but Arya does not complain. Her wolf dreams continue despite the distance between her and Nymeria. Brusco's daughters even note that she growls in her sleep sometimes.

During her time as Cat, Arya learns of her aunt's death. She is indifferent to hear that, as something that's associated with someone else.

Around this time, Arya crosses paths with Sam on his way to Oldtown and saves him from two bullies. Sam tells Arya his name, but she does not reveal her true identity, thus they remain in the dark about their mutual connection to Jon Snow, and the opportunity for a reunion of Starks is lost. By meeting Sam, Arya also recognizes a Night's Watch deserter (Sam's companion) who spends a good deal of time with her Braavosi friends. At first, she plans to ask him to take her back to the Wall with him so she can reunite with Jon, but Dareon announces that he plans to make a life for himself in Braavos. Arya kills him, and since he never harmed her - she excuses the deed by claiming that he broke his vows; she ignores the fact that they are out of Westeros, and that she dissociated herself from her past - thus she has no right to kill the deserter. For this, she is given warm milk by the kindly man, and wakes up the next morning blind.

In A Dance with Dragons, Arya continues to train with the Faceless Men without her sight. The blindness is induced by the milk she drinks every night. The kindly man tells her that they would have taken her eyes from her anyway, to help her to learn to use her other senses, but not for half a year. She begs at the streets, calling herself "Blind Beth", collecting money and pieces of information (among them about the two Lyseni pirate ships, Goodheart and Elephant, which were indirectly involved in the massacre at Hardhome) and continues performing chores at the House. Occasionally she hears people talk about "The Black Bastard of the Wall." That makes her sad, thinking that even Jon would never know Blind Beth. Sometimes she hurts herself, but does not complain. She misses the company of Brusco and her friends, though. The Waif tells her she must stay blind "Until darkness is as sweet to you as light, or until you ask us for your eyes" (in that case she will be sent away). Arya does not give up, and gradually learns to rely on her other senses. These senses include not only the conventional sense, but also her skinchanging abilities. Arya begins to skinchange into a cat who follows her around Braavos. Occasionally, someone (it turns to be the kindly man) beats her with a stick. She uses knowledge gained through the cat's eyes to impress the kindly man, telling him that she knows it has been him who is hitting her but without mentioning the cat. Apparently, this completes her blind training, because then she is given her eyesight back.

After Arya regains her eyesight, The Kindly Man gives Arya her first assignment - to kill the old insurance seller. Arya is uncertain whether to fulfill her mission, since her intended victim has never wronged her, her friends or her family, and she does not even know whether he did anything that he deserves death for. She comes up with very ridiculous reasons to kill him (he outlived her father, his hands are shaking, etc.), perhaps to ease her conscience. At last she kills him, then the Kindly Man orders her to go to Izembaro to begin her first apprenticeship. Unlike in the show, she is not ordered to kill any of the actors (at least not yet), and it is unclear for what purpose she was ordered to join the troupe. She takes on the new identity of Mercy and learns acting with the troupe. While she is there, she notices Rafford and kills him, without being ordered to, thus avenging Lommy's death.

Arya is often asked by the Kindly man, the waif and other characters "who are you?" and she answers "no one." They nearly always respond with "you lie", implying she has not yet let go of her past identity, thus unfit to join the Faceless Men. Arya has been using many false names during her plotline, among them: Arry, Weasel, Nan, Squab, Salty, Cat of the Canals, Beth, the lastly - Mercedene/Mercy; perhaps it symbolizes Arya's gradual loss of identity. Despite this, she retains her true identity as Arya Stark. This is brought up several times with her inner monologue where she says she was never any of those identities for true and by the Faceless Men who say she wears the other identities as one would wear a dress, but beneath those she is still Arya.

Meanwhile, in the North, Jeyne Poole, is forced by the Lannisters (at Littlefinger's advice) to pose as Arya, who is considered dead, and is betrothed to Ramsay Bolton in order to strengthen the Boltons' claim on the North. This political move brings some Northerners to their side in support of "Arya", while other Northerners joined Stannis Baratheon's forces in order to rescue her from them. The belief that his sister is being forced to marry Ramsay also torments Jon. Repeatedly, he reminds himself that as a member of the Night's Watch, he must put aside past ties to his family but finds he is unable to truly do so. When Melisandre offers him the chance to save his sister, Jon accepts and Melisandre sends Mance Rayder with a group of spearwives to save Arya. When Melisandre tells him that she has seen a vision of Arya traveling to the Wall on a dying horse to escape this marriage, Jon tries to prepare for how he will take care of Arya now - as much as he wants to keep her with him, it is not safe for her and debates finding a noble family to foster her across the sea, where she will be safest. However, the girl escaping her marriage turns out to be their distant relation Alys Karstark, whom Jon helps. The plan with Mance and the spearwives leads to Jeyne Poole's escape with Theon. In response, Ramsay (or someone who pretends to be him) sends a letter threatening Jon, demanding "Arya"'s return, and claiming that Stannis is dead. This eventually leads to a mutiny against Jon when he decides to leave Castle Black to rescue who he believes is Arya from the Boltons and confront Ramsay. The real Arya has no idea of these events.

Arya's death list in the books is partially different than in the show, both the names, the manner by which some of they die, and their killers:

The Mountain. Severely injured by Oberyn Martell. Presumably reanimated by Qyburn as Ser Robert Strong.
Dunsen, one of the Mountain's soldiers, for taking Gendry's helmet.
{Polliver}, for taking Needle. Killed by the Hound at the Inn at the Crossroads.
{Chiswyck}, one of the Mountain's soldiers, for assisting the Tickler to torture the captives on the way to Harrenhal. Killed by Jaqen H'ghar at Harrenhal.
{Rafford} aka Raff the Sweetling, one of the Mountain's soldiers, for killing Lommy. Killed by Arya at Braavos.
{The Tickler}, for torturing to death many captives. Killed by Arya at the Inn at the Crossroads.
The Hound. Severely injured by Polliver and the Tickler, and left to die. Although Arya is uncertain of his status, she removed him from her list.
{Amory Lorch}, for killing Yoren. Thrown to the bear pit at Roose Bolton and Vargo Hoat's command, and torn apart.
Ilyn Payne
Meryn Trant
{Joffrey}, killed at the Purple Wedding.
Cersei
{Weese} the understeward at Harrenhal, for treating Arya very brutally. Killed by Jaqen H'ghar at Harrenhal.
Arya begins reciting the names of the first twelve people on her list while being taken to Harrenhal. Soon after she starts working there under Weese's supervision, she adds him, and this is the end of her list because he is beating her. Sometimes she says the phrase "Valar Morghulis", which she learned from Jaqen, along with her list. So far, four of the people are still alive, two (the Cleganes) are in uncertain status, and seven are confirmed dead. In the books, Melisandre never retrieved Gendry from the Brotherhood Without Banners, so the Red Woman, Beric, and Thoros aren't on the list. She also does not add "Walder Frey" to her list: rather, she states that she would have added "the Freys" to her list - any and all of them who took part in the Red Wedding - but she wasn't sure which ones specifically took part in it and which ones didn't.

In sharp contrast to Arya's "sugarcoated" portrayal in the show, in the books she gradually loses her humanity, her soul growing darker to the point that she kills people who have never done her any harm. It may be the result of the hell Arya has been through: forced to kill in self-defense; watching her father being unjustly executed while she is powerless to do anything; traveling in the company of questionable people (Yoren's caravan, the Brotherhood and the Hound); helplessly watching people being slaughtered like sheep on the way to Harrenhal; running away from one captivity to another; held at the mercy of inhuman monsters like the Mountain and Vargo Hoat; the last straw might have been the duel between Beric and the Hound, which made Arya realize there is such thing as justice - the only rule is "might makes right."

As Arya's plotline progresses and her soul grows darker, murder becomes her prime solution for every encounter; before she kills a guard at Harrenhal, she does not consider other options, like sneaking past him or knocking him unconscious. Only if the objective circumstances do not allow her to commit a murder (when she considers killing Gendry and a woman who cheats her at Saltpans) - she tries less violent way. In the fourth and fifth novels, she murders people who have not done her, her family or friends any ill - Dareon and the old insurance seller. Unlike Ramsay, Arya does not draw a sadistic pleasure from killing; it has become a need for her, the way a vampire needs blood. It seems she does not really care whom she kills; if someone from her death list happens to be nearby (Rafford), she'd kill him, but she is no hurry to look for those who are responsible for the destruction of her house.

The World of Ice & Fire source book released in 2014 revealed that Arya was named after Eddard's maternal grandmother, Arya Flint, from the northern mountain clans. The main novels did mention that Eddard's grandmother was from the mountain clans but didn't state her name. These clans have no connection to the hill tribes of the Vale whom Tyrion encounters on the way from the Eyrie; they are minor Houses loyal to Winterfell who live in the northwestern highlands. They are a hardy folk, both due to their rough lands, and because they are located near the coast, vulnerable to attack by sea from both the ironborn and the wildlings. Like House Mormont, also located just off the northwest coast and vulnerable to these attacks, many women in the clans often have to take up arms to fight off raiders. These clans join Stannis in his military campaign against the ironborn and the Boltons.

Arya is the only book character which has POV chapters in all five published novels (and in the sixth upcoming novel too).

According to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, "Arya" is pronounced "ARE - yuh." George R.R. Martin himself has pointed out that a surprisingly large number of people pronounce it incorrectly: it consists of two syllables, not three (like how the "aria" of an opera is pronounced). Martin explained: "I say it 'Are-ya', two syllables not three. Not 'are-ee-uh', not like an operatic thing, but 'Are-ya', very sharp. I wanted something that was like a knife, that was a sharp and hard sound, to be a contrast to the flowery 'Sansa'."
