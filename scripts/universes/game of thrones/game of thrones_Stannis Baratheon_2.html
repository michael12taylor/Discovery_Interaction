<html><p>Stannis respects Eddard Stark, but strongly resents him for being Robert's best friend and for his appointment to the King's Hand - an office Stannis believed that he should have been granted. Stannis's grudge did not decrease even after Eddard's death. Although Catelyn reminded Stannis that it was Eddard who broke the siege of Storm's End, and assured him that Eddard never wanted to be Robert's Hand, it did not appease Stannis at all. Stannis replied that Eddard did so on Robert's orders, and privately, Stannis was angry that Robert was more grateful to Eddard for breaking the siege than to him for actually holding Storm's End. Nevertheless, Stannis told Catelyn that he was sorry for Eddard's death, and promised her justice for his murder. Stannis respected Eddard as an honorable man, and privately understood that it was beyond Ned's control that Robert liked him more than his own brother.

Many characters fear that due to Stannis's rigid and legalistic personality, he would make a terrible king. One major source of criticism are Stannis's frequent statements that had the decision been his, he wouldn't have pardoned many former Targaryen loyalists as Robert did when he was crowned. Now that Stannis is trying to take the capital, he openly tells his advisors such as Davos that if he succeeds, he will clean house by purging all of the disloyal court officials, instead of pardoning them or outright letting them continue in their positions as Robert did. The irony is that while several characters feel this sentiment is shockingly brutal, it becomes increasingly apparent that there was some sense to it: most of Robert's small council members were either corrupt people or disloyal conspirators who actively aided the Lannisters in killing him, putting Joffrey on the throne, and the coup against Ned Stark. Varys has always been a Targaryen loyalist; Pycelle had already betrayed the previous king for the Lannisters; and Littlefinger was most loyal to himself - while keeping half the City Watch, including Commander Janos Slynt, bought and paid for. Stannis was actually not amiss for suspecting that they did not have Robert's best interests at heart.

One of Stannis's main flaws is the lack of charisma, which his brothers had plenty of. In the beginning of the second novel, a very few houses answer his summoning, while Renly gathers rather easily a very large host in a relatively short time. Stannis is decent enough to admit his flaw, "My brother made them love him, but it would seem that I inspire only betrayal." His tactless attitude is another serious flaw: it alienates people who potentially could have become his allies, as he did with Robb Stark: during the parley with Renly and Catelyn, Stannis bluntly told Catelyn, "I am the rightful king, and your son no less a traitor than my brother here. His day will come as well", thus ruining any chance of an alliance between himself and the Starks.

In a notable change, in the books, Stannis was the one who initiated the investigation that Jon Arryn conducted in discovering the truth of the parentage of Cersei's children, and fled back to Dragonstone shortly after Arryn's death. In the TV series, there is no indication that Stannis knows about the situation before Eddard sends him a letter about it.

In the second novel, Stannis explains to Catelyn and Renly that he couldn't simply go to Robert and make such an accusation, that conveniently made Stannis the next on Robert's line of heirs; he needed Jon Arryn, whom Robert greatly trusted, to back him up. Following Arryn's death, Stannis most logical step was to contact Ned Stark, tell him what he and Arryn discovered, and ask Ned to support his accusation about Cersei's children. Robert would have probably believed Ned, since they were close friends. The reason Stannis has not acted that way is probably the grudge he bears against Ned.

During his stay at King's Landing, Eddard sent Stannis two letters: the first contained a polite request to return to the council. Eddard did not receive any answer, and it is unknown whether Stannis received it. The second letter, which Eddard wrote after discovering the truth about Cersei's children, was given to Tomard with strict instructions to deliver it personally to Stannis. However, Tom was killed and the letter was taken from his body before it could be delivered.

Melisandre created two shadow-creatures with Stannis in the books - one to kill Renly, the other to kill Ser Cortnay Penrose (the castellan of Storm's End, who remained loyal to Renly even after his death and refused to yield to Stannis). She later explains that creating a shadow-creature drains some of a man's life-energy, thus she is unwilling to attempt to create any more for fear that it would kill Stannis. Afterwards, Stannis is said to noticeably look slightly older - not drastically so, but slightly enough that most people just attribute it to being haggard from the great stress of losing the Battle of the Blackwater.

Following the Battle of the Blackwater, there are many who believe Stannis has given up any hope for the Iron Throne. Tywin, who considers Stannis as the greatest danger of all the other contenders combined (he said that to Tyrion in the first novel), does not think so, stating at a meeting of the small council: "This is Stannis Baratheon. The man will fight to the bitter end and then some." He speculates that Stannis may try to rally the Stormlords or form an alliance with Dorne. Davos has a similar opinion about his king: "It is not in Stannis to yield, so long as he knows his claim is just."

Despite what it seems, Stannis is not dominated by Melisandre. He listens to her advice and prophecies, but keeps an open mind. For instance: in the third novel, she repeatedly urges him to sacrifice his nephew Edric Storm (in the show he is replaced by Gendry), promising that it will grant him the power to wake dragons out of stone. Stannis is fascinated by the idea of riding a dragon against his enemies, like Aegon the Conqueror; yet he takes Melisandre's words with a grain of salt, since he is familiar with the stories about the tragedy at Summerhall and the unsuccessful attempts of the nine mages from Essos, Baelor the Blessed and Aerion Targaryen. He also is not thrilled about killing his nephew. When he finally agrees - rather halfheartedly - to sacrifice Edric (unaware that Davos has sent the youth away), he demands that Melisandre swears first there is no other way, warning her that if she lies - it will cost her life.

Writer Bryan Cogman explained in a Season 3 interview the TV series' approach to adapting Stannis as a character. Some critics were upset that Stannis seemed like a fairly negative character in Season 2, but the writers were making a conscious choice to reveal the layers to his personality gradually. In part due to time constraints, Season 2 focused primarily upon showing how stern Stannis was. By Season 3, however, the writers would then surprise the audience by showing different facets of Stannis, how he feels bound by his duty, and his odd family relationships: his wife is a religious zealot who blames herself for her many stillbirths even though Stannis does not, that he has a sickly daughter who he actually tries to treat well (despite his limited interpersonal skills), etc. as Cogman explained at length:

In the books, Stannis does not travel to Braavos to get a loan from the Iron Bank before the Battle of Castle Black. Rather, long after the battle, while Stannis marches to Winterfell, Tycho Nestoris arrives at Castle Black to see Stannis; it happens at a much later point than in the show, and only after the Lannisters keep refusing to pay the Crown's debt.

At the end of A Storm of Swords, Stannis travels to the Wall and smashes Mance Rayder's army. Davos is not with him, because Stannis has sent him earlier to the White Harbor. After realizing who Jon Snow is, Stannis offers to legitimize him as Jon Stark and make him Lord of Winterfell in exchange for his support; Jon thinks it over and decides to decline Stannis's offer, and is elected the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch shortly after.

Stannis's victory over the wildlings does not impress the people of the North. Much to his frustration, his summoning letters are rejected by Lyanna Mormont and other houses (similarly to what happened in the beginning of the second novel). Only Arnolf Karstark, the castellan of Karhold, agrees to support Stannis, but he turns to be a traitor: he secretly collaborates with the Boltons.

In A Dance with Dragons, Stannis consults with Jon about his next steps. Jon knows that by serving as Stannis's (unofficial) advisor, he is walking on very thin ice, since the Watch is supposed to be neutral; yet he feels obligated to assist Stannis, for saving the defenders of Castle Black. Jon dissuades Stannis from ill-advised ideas that would have cost him dearly, among them granting the abandoned castles of the Watch to his knights and lords, and attacking the Dreadfort. Stannis does not like what Jon tells him, but follows his advices.

Stannis quarrels with Jon numerous times over his decision and even implies that he can have Jon executed and replaced, but Jon refuses to be intimidated and Stannis eventually backs down.

Stannis's campaign to liberate the North from its enemies, namely the ironborn and the Boltons, is also much longer. His initial idea (prompted by the treacherous Arnolf Karstark) is to attack the Dreadfort, but Jon convinces him that the castle is too heavily fortified; instead, he advises Stannis to seek the support of the Northern mountain clans, who are loyal to the Starks, and to liberate other parts of the North from the ironborn.

As time passes, Stannis's rigid personality has somewhat softened: he realizes that people will not accept him as the king just because he is Robert's legal heir. He also learns the lesson that Ned Stark failed to understand (until it was too late): in order to achieve his goals, he must sometimes compromise his principles. For example: Jon explains to Stannis that if he commands the Northern mountain clans to fight for him, they will look at one another and say "Who is this man? He is no king of mine"; instead, Stannis must adopt a friendly attitude, to feast with the clans and praise them. Stannis says grudgingly, "Why should I beg for what is owed me?", but does as Jon advised him, and that way he manages to rally the clans.

Thanks to Jon's beneficial advices, Stannis gains the support of the Northern mountain clans, liberates Deepwood Motte and takes Asha Greyjoy (Yara's name in the novels) prisoner. The victory grants Stannis credibility in the eyes of the Northern Houses, and many survivors of them join his host. Stannis then sets his sights on Winterfell, but is unaware that Roose is holding Ramsay Bolton's wedding to Jeyne Poole there so as to lure Stannis into a trap, since the Karstarks in Stannis's army are secretly working with the Boltons and planning to betray him. Heavy snowstorms also slow Stannis's progress. In contrast to the series, Stannis does not take Davos, Melisandre, Selyse, and Shireen with him; the latter two still being alive at the book's climax.

In the meantime, Alys Karstark arrives at Castle Black and tells Jon about her great-uncle's schemes. Jon immediately sends Tycho Nestoris to warn Stannis about the traitors in his host, which he does.

At the end of A Dance with Dragons, Ramsay (or someone posing as Ramsay) sends Jon a letter claiming to have killed Stannis and smashed his army, but the battle is not shown and Stannis's fate is left unrevealed. There are several anomalies about the letter, which imply that its contents are false and its writer is not Ramsay.

Before traveling to the North, Stannis leaves skeletal garrisons in Dragonstone and Storm's End. In the fourth novel, Cersei sends Lord Paxter Redwyne and Mace Tyrell to conquer the two castles. Eventually, Loras Tyrell conquers Dragonstone, and in "Arianne II" sample chapter of the sixth novel it is reported (but not confirmed yet) that Storm's End has been taken by the Golden Company, on behalf of the presumed-dead Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell), the son of Rhaegar and Elia. It is unlikely that Stannis is aware of the fall of both his castles; in his current position, there is nothing he can do about that anyway.

Author George R.R. Martin has since stated that in the books, Stannis is currently alive and well. Thus, by the point the books reached, Stannis is the sole survivor of the five kings, after whom the War of the Five Kings is titled.

A released sample chapter from The Winds of Winter depicts Stannis holding Theon as his captive, preparing for the battle with the Boltons after having discovered the Karstarks' treachery and sentencing his prisoners Arnolf and Arthor Karstark to death, but it is currently unknown if this chapter takes place before or after Ramsay sends the letter to Jon. Stannis plans to execute Theon as a punishment for the atrocities he committed against the North, the actual (the savage harrying of the Stony Shore and the capture of Winterfell, which cost the lives of many innocent people) and the alleged (the murder of the Stark boys), to gain more support from the North. Stannis also makes a deal with Tycho Nestoris and sends Ser Justin Massey to escort Tycho back to Braavos, where he must hire at least 20,000 sellswords. Justin is instructed to do the same even if Stannis dies at Winterfell, and keep fighting to put Shireen on the Iron Throne.

Brienne has not seen Stannis ever since his hostile parley with Renly and Catelyn. She and Podrick search for Sansa in the Riverlands, and recently have been taken captive by the Brotherhood Without Banners and its vengeful new leader, the monstrous Lady Stoneheart (the reanimated Catelyn); thus they are not involved in the events at the North.

Apparently, as Melisandre has repeatedly warned Stannis, the deaths of the three "usurpers" did not get him even one step closer to the Iron Throne: his plan to pardon the Northmen and the ironborn and get them to his side was strongly opposed by Selyse and Melisandre, and even himself clenched his jaw at the idea of looking like a weak beggar in need of support. Also, Stannis knew that the Lannister still had a false heir, while the Greyjoys had too many heirs. The two kings, Euron and Tommen, simply filled the places left by Balon and Joffrey. However, since Stannis is still alive in the books and has obtained the support of the Mormonts, Glovers, Umbers, and other Northern houses, it can be argued that the three deaths have assisted him indirectly: 

As a result of Balon's death, the ironborn's manpower in the north was significantly reduced, what made it easier for Stannis to liberate Deepwood Motte, and by that gain credibility in the eyes of the people of the North.
Robb's death has left a void. The people of the North wanted to pay their oppressors back, but needed someone to rally them; Stannis has proven himself capable for that mission.
Joffrey's death has triggered a chain of events that resulted in Tywin's death - and from that point began the gradual decline of House Lannister, mainly due to Cersei's total incompetence as a ruler. Considering how far the show strayed from the books (in respect of the plotlines of Sansa, Dorne and more), it is not impossible that Stannis will survive the second Battle of Winterfell, and may take advantage of the unstable state of affairs at King's Landing. However, Stannis does not mean to march any southern than Moat Cailin and means to garrison every castle at the Wall with his forces, the Northmen, the Night's Watch, and the Free Folk. He does not plan to risk his resources until the critical situation with the Others and the army of the dead is fully resolved, so if he survives the Battle of Ice, he could die fighting during winter fighting against a human faction or the Others.
