<html><p>The third was Ser Humfrey Wagstaff. He was sixty-five years old, and Brienne only sixteen. The day they were betrothed, he warned Brienne that he would expect her to be a proper woman once they’d wed “I will not have my lady wife cavorting about in man’s mail. On this you shall obey me, lest I be forced to chastise you.” She was still shy despite her prowess, yet somehow she had found the courage to tell Ser Humfrey that she would accept chastisement only from a man who could outfight her. The old knight purpled, but agreed to don his own armor to teach her a woman’s proper place. They fought with blunted tourney weapons. She broke Ser Humfrey’s collarbone, two ribs, and their betrothal. He was her third prospective husband, and her last. Her father did not insist again.
When Brienne was young, Septa Roelle was her tutor. Instead of helping Brienne to gain confidence despite her ugliness, Roelle did the opposite: she kept telling Brienne that she was freakish big, mannish and slow learner, and that men talked to her kindly only because they wanted to win her father’s favor.

The books don't make specific mention of her mother: in the TV series she says that she never knew her, implying that she died when Brienne was very young. Brienne has a good relationship with her father and describes him as a good man. She notes that (since her mother died) he is in a relationship with a new female romantic interest every year or so.

According to author George R.R. Martin, Brienne in the books is supposed to be unusually tall and muscular for a woman, but not freakishly so. She is above six feet tall but not near seven feet (i.e. actress Gwendoline Christie matches this at 6 feet 3 inches). She is taller than Jaime Lannister or Renly Baratheon, and significantly more heavyset. Still, she is not quite as tall as either Greatjon Umber or Sandor Clegane (i.e. Rory McCann, who plays the latter, is 6'6").

There is widespread fan speculation that Brienne of Tarth is a descendant of the famous knight Duncan the Tall, who eventually rose to be Lord Commander of the Kingsguard under his friend King Aegon V Targaryen. Ser Duncan ("Dunk") and Aegon "Egg" Targaryen are the two main characters in the "Tales of Dunk and Egg" prequel novellas, which start about 90 years before Game of Thrones begins. George R.R. Martin has stated that, with time-jumps in between each story, he intends for the prequel novellas to cover the entire lives of Dunk and Egg, up until about 50 years ago. There are three pieces of evidence that Brienne might be Duncan's descendant:

Martin actually said that a descendant of Duncan would appear in the fourth novel "A Feast for Crows", though he never indicated who it was.
In the fourth novel, Brienne mentions in passing, while selecting a new image for her shield, that she recalls an old shield from her youth which was present in her family's armory at Evenfall Hall; the description she gives matches Ser Duncan's personal sigil (a green shooting star over a green elm tree, on a sunset-orange field).
Though most general, "Ser Duncan the Tall" was famously a very tall man, nearly seven feet in height, and Brienne is unusually tall for a woman by Westeros standards.
There is also speculation that Hodor may be a descendant of Ser Duncan, as Hodor is also extremely tall, over seven feet in height, and the upcoming fourth prequel novella, The She-Wolves of Winterfell, reveals that Ser Duncan traveled to Winterfell. At one point Bran Stark has a greensight vision of the past, and sees a very large man "as tall as Hodor" in the Winterfell godswood, being kissed by a slender young woman - who might have been Old Nan.

Speaking at Balticon 2016, George R.R. Martin seemed to have all but confirmed that Brienne is a descendant of Duncan the Tall: a fan asked him if he would eventually decide how Brienne is specifically descended from Ser Duncan - not "if" she is descended from Ser Duncan - and his short answer was that he hadn't decided yet. This would seem to confirm that she is descended from Ser Duncan, but Martin hadn't at the time figured out the intervening generations.

She first met Renly when he came to Tarth to see her father who was his bannerman. He treated her with courtesy and respect. He danced with her, and she has been in love with him ever since. Lady Catelyn realizes this the first time she sees Brienne looking at Renly (down at him, as she stands a half-hand taller than him). Brienne always tries to be at Renly's side. She offers to guard him the night before the battle, but Renly says no as he and Loras are going to "pray together privately." He accepts her offer to come before dawn to arm him for the battle, others who hear this snicker, and Lady Catelyn thinks it sad that she is thought of as a joke, because she acts the part of a squire and dresses him just to have the opportunity to touch him.

According to Loras, Renly thought that Brienne was absurd - a woman dressed in man's mail, pretending to be a knight. Yet he kept her close, because all his other knights wanted things of him, castles or honors or riches, but all that Brienne wanted was to die for him. Loras also believes that Brienne killed Renly. When she and Jaime return to King's Landing, Loras (a member of the Kingsguard in the book narrative) confronts Brienne and orders her to draw her sword. Jaime intervenes and warns Loras that Brienne is as strong as Gregor Clegane, and if Loras duels her it will likely be his corpse that is carried away afterwards.

When Brienne joined Renly's army, he greeted her courteously and welcomed her to his service. She expected the other knights to treat her with coldness and mockery, but to her surprise many of them were exceedingly kind to her, going above and beyond the others to win her favor, except Randyll Tarly who was openly hostile toward her. Brienne was confused and suspicious to be treated so warmly. The mystery was solved when Dickon Tarly overheard by chance four knights talking about a wager that three of the soldiers put on the first who could claim Brienne's maidenhead, and many others joined the contest. Dickon told his father, and Randyll put an end to the wager, knowing that some of the challengers were less honorable than others, and it was only a matter of time before one of them decided to claim the prize by force. He told Brienne about the wager, bluntly claiming it was her fault. Brienne was deeply offended, and said that she came to fight and never did anything to encourage those knights. Randyll was not appeased, and told her that her presence alone encouraged them because a war host is no place for a maiden.

After Brienne remains at Harrenhal when Jaime is sent away by Roose Bolton, Vargo Hoat (Locke in the TV series) attempts to rape her, but she fights him off, biting off his ear in the process. Jaime is amused when he later learns that the wound festered, driving Hoat half mad with the pain.

After she is dispatched by Jaime to find and protect Sansa, Brienne spends most of her time in the Riverlands, fruitlessly seeking information on Sansa's whereabouts; unbeknownst to her, she is on the wrong track right from the beginning, since Sansa is in the Vale. During an encounter with the Brave Companions, Brienne learns to know that the Hound was seen with a Stark girl; Brienne incorrectly assumes that was Sansa. At the Quiet Isle, the Eldery Brother tells Brienne the girl who accompanied the Hound was not Sansa but Arya. These pieces of information do not help Brienne find Arya either.

Podrick Payne runs away from King's Landing and meets up with Brienne at Maidenpool, hoping that if they find Sansa, they will also find Tyrion. During a bloody encounter with three of the Brave Companions (Timeon, Pyg and Shagwell), Pod helps Brienne by throwing a stone at Shagwell's head, stunning him while Brienne deals with the other thugs, and eventually kills all the three. 

She and Pod never encounter Arya or the Hound, though they do meet Rorge (who is posing as the Hound) and Biter near the Inn at the Crossroads. Brienne kills Rorge, but is badly wounded in a savage fight with Biter, before he is killed by Gendry. 

Brienne, Pod and their companion Hyle Hunt are taken captive by the Brotherhood Without Banners, now led by the monstrous Lady Stoneheart (the reanimated Catelyn Stark). She is accused of serving the Lannisters, since she carries a Lannister sword and a parchment signed by Tommen.

Brienne, shocked to see the monster Catelyn turned into, tells her she was looking for Sansa, and that Jaime has changed; her words fall on deaf ears. Lady Stoneheart incorrectly believes that Jaime was involved in the Red Wedding, and gives Brienne a choice: "Take the sword and slay the Kingslayer, or be hanged for a betrayer." Brienne refuses to make the choice; Lady Stoneheart commands to hang them. As the ropes tighten, Brienne screams a word in order to save her companions.

In "A Dance with Dragons", after resolving the siege of Raventree Hall, Jaime meets Brienne at Pennytree. Jaime is stunned to see her injuries. Brienne tells him that she found Sansa, and "I can take you to her, ser... but you will need to come alone. Elsewise, the Hound will kill her." It is obvious (to the readers) that Brienne is lying, since Sansa is in the Vale, and the Hound's fate is unknown. It appears Brienne intends to lead Jaime into a trap; the chapter ends with a cliffhanger.

Brienne never finds Sansa and thus does not travel to Winterfell to rescue her, nor does she kill Stannis. She does meet up with Jaime again while he is pacifying the Riverlands, but has no involvement in the siege of Riverrun. In the TV series, her storyline has been somewhat merged with that of Mance Rayder, who infiltrates Winterfell to rescue Arya from Ramsay (unaware that it is a disguised Jeyne Poole), although unlike Mance, Brienne ultimately does not enter Winterfell.

Brienne and Cersei have no interactions throughout the novels. In the fifth novel Cersei is told that Jaime was seen in Brienne's company. She vaguely remembers Brienne as "a huge, ugly, shambling thing who dressed in man's mail." It is unknown where she met Brienne; since Brienne was arrested at Jaime's order (for her own protection) as soon as they entered King's Landing, and left shortly after Jaime released her, Cersei could not have met her.

Brienne always presents herself or is announced as "Brienne of Tarth", and never "Brienne Tarth", which would also be correct. The reason for this naming preference is not known.

Brienne's name did not appear in the Season 1 pronunciation guide, but the phonetic pronunciation of her name was later seen written out in a behind-the-scenes short video: "bree-ANN."
