<html><p>Indomitable will: Batman has tremendous determination and strength of will, which make him an extremely formidable opponent, one who absolutely refuses to hunker down and give up, even when placed against seemingly insurmountable odds. Although his years of fighting crime in Gotham non-stop seemed endless, even after losing Robin and seeing many good men become corrupt, Batman never gave up in his crusade, if only becoming much more relentless and darker but still having sufficient will to stop himself from killing criminals who survived. Hence, during the Black Zero Event, Bruce fearlessly ran through the extremely dangerous clouds of debris in order to save any survivors within the wreckage of the collapsed Wayne Financial building. Months later, even when Superman himself personally warned Batman to back off, Batman showed no signs of fear, boldly countering Superman's threat with one of his own. Indeed, in a vision of a possible future, when a malevolent Superman enforces totalitarian rule upon Earth with his Regime, Batman promptly establishes and lead the Insurgency against him, refusing to submit to the alien tyrant even when his Insurgent forces are eventually defeated by the Regime Stormtroopers, leaving Batman helpless and at Superman's mercy. Batman later refused to stay down when Superman knocked him to the ground repeatedly during their duel, persisting until he finally won and had the weakened Kryptonian at his mercy. Even when Lex Luthor warned Batman of the inevitable threat posed by Steppenwolf's impending invasion, Batman, despite Earth now being vulnerable after Superman's death and his feelings of great remorse for allowing Superman to die, displays his strength of will by never once succumbing to despair, and instead dedicates himself to honoring Superman in death - enlisting Wonder Woman's help in founding and uniting the Justice League, to fight against this new threat. Batman later decides to resurrect Superman with a Mother Box despite Wonder Woman and Aquaman's protests, as he was confident in his contingency, which ultimately proved to be correct. Shortly thereafter, Batman is willing to sacrifice himself to defeat Steppenwolf and save the world - by distracting an army of Parademons, thereby giving the Justice League a necessary opening to dismantle the Unity but Wonder Woman decides to save Batman instead.
Weaknesses
Bruce's horrific dreams
Post-traumatic stress disorder: Bruce was deeply traumatized by the murder of his parents at a young age. He experienced a PTSD episode when Superman mentioned his mother's name, who shared the name as his mother as well as being his father's last word, triggering him to relive the horrific events. Shortly after Bruce lost his parents, he fell into a well and was surrounded by bats, causing him to develop a fear of them (chiroptophobia). Hence, he suffers from nightmares of a Bat Creature haunting him. Bruce has also lost other people close to him, such as Robin at the hands of Joker (after he sent his ward on a mission, prompting him to blame himself for the former's death and break the latter's teeth, while the Joker tatooed the word "damaged" on his forehead to remind batman of when he lost control) and Jack O'Dwyer during the Black Zero Event. His experiences have hardened him, as noted by Sal, with Alfred stating him feeling powerless has led him to become cruel in his crusade against crime. Bruce also went on about how many good men were left, and how many turned bad, causing him to assign less worth to promises and grow cynical. His attitude brought him into conflict with Superman, and almost killed the latter with the Kryptonite spear until he realized the Man of Steel was, in a way, human. Having used his kryptonite gas on him and leaving less for Doomsdayf, Bruce partially blamed himself for Superman's death, declaring that he had failed him. During the Knightmare, Bruce also stated to Joker that he has "been dead inside" for a long time.
Equipment
As the CEO of Wayne Enterprises and thus the leader of the world's 6th highest tech conglomerate in the world, with the wealth of over $97 million, Bruce Wayne has an immense fortune, making him the sixth wealthiest man in the world, only surpassed by the CEO of the other 5 superiorly high-ranked tech conglomerates, such as his business rival Lex Luthor and the Queen Industries CEO. His wealth allows Bruce access to some of the most sophisticated technology in the world (most of it located in his hidden Batcave under the Wayne Manor), allowing him to create the equipment that is crucial to him as Batman, with it effectively compensating for his lack of superpowers. Indeed, when questioned by Flash, Batman claims that being rich is his superpower. Bruce notably used his company resources to mail the original photograph of Steve Trevor's team across the Atlantic, to Diana Prince at the Louvre Museum. After establishing the Justice League, Batman once again utilizes his technology to aid their mutual cause, notably constructing the Flying Fox. Also, Bruce was more than willing to use his wealth to anonymously pay for all of the expenses of Clark Kent's funeral, and to help Clark and Martha keep the Kent farm by purchasing a bank.

Suit
Batman standing on a statue
Batsuit: Batman's highly durable Kevlar-titanium tri-weave protective suit and combat armor (later inspiring the Robin suit), used to compensate for his lack of invulnerability. It consists of three thin highly durable Titanium-kevlar bodysuit layers and an outer and thinner layer of durable and heatproof spandex. It is invulnerable to blades, and bullets and is also heatproof. The Batsuit's cowl also digitally alters Batman's voice, making it unrecognizable to those that know him as Bruce Wayne. The cowl, neck, gauntlets, and boots are able to effortlessly deflect small arm rounds, blades as well as the Parademons' projectiles and Superman's heat vision, though the rest of the suit is not impacted proof nor impregnable, as a blade could partially pierce the shoulder region (though it only had pierced the spandex layer and poked Batman without breaking the armor or his skin) and cause Batman a small amount of pain. Even so, it is not enough to truly harm or even slow down the wearer, as Batman seemed to only feel a small amount of pain after getting stabbed. Besides, the suit and cape can protect the wearer from explosions, which allowed Batman to shield Martha Kent from Knyazev's exploding flamethrower tank that engulfed the entire room they were in. The cape also provides gliding abilities, as shown when Batman glides a few feet before breaking into the warehouse window after jumping from the front end of the Batplane during the Rescue of Martha Kent and gliding into the Knightcrawler during the Skirmish under Gotham Harbor; although Batman rarely uses this ability, limiting its use to only during demanding situations, instead favouring the Grapple Gun most of the time for traversing out-of-reach places. During his fight with Superman, Bruce wore a more heavily armored variant of the Batsuit to withstand the Kryptonian's attacks. In preparation for Steppenwolf's invasion, Bruce wore a variant that was lighter and facilitated more mobility but without sacrificing the protection gained from its armored plates.
Utility Belt: Batman's specially designed belt, with its many pouches filled with an arsenal of numerous gadgets, weapons, and tools at all times, to aid Batman in his mission.
Respirator Mask: Batman's small mask that allows him to successfully breathe in locations with limited oxygen, such as when he was attacked by Firefly's flamethrower, and when he dived underwater to save Harley Quinn from the submerged Smiley Car.
Weapons and Gadgets
Batarangs:     A batarang   Batman's extremely sharp (capable of piercing concrete walls), but non-lethal throwing gadgets in the shape of his symbol, wielded by Batman when carrying out different tasks, from incapacitating criminals to breaking through windows. When thrown by someone as strong as Batman, they're capable of cutting through even gun barrels and heavily damage them. Batman also leaves batarangs near crime scenes after he's finished as a calling card, with a dual purpose using them as a psychological weapon against other potential wrongdoers.
A batarang
Grapple Gun:      Batman wielding his Grapple Gun  Batman's line launching, multi-purpose, highly versatile, and handgun-like device that fires a retractable, detachable line with a mechanized, magnetic, or clawed end, which Batman utilizes to traverse Gotham City, escape danger and remain hidden from foes, all while allowing him to scale rappel, swing, catapult, or slingshot himself along structures or across gaps. It allows him to ascend and descend, much like an elevator or pulley system, at a harmless rate. It consists of a spool of cable, a winding device, and reloading feature. Once, it is shot a surface, it pulls the user at great speed towards their target and quickly retracts into the device once it is reached. This can be done in rapid succession, with the device being able to fire against instantly after retracting, with the speed of the device retracting being similar to flight. The line can pull great amounts of weight, as Batman can use it to slowly descend several stories while wearing his Armored Batsuit. It can also be used to pull on an enemy with great force, enough to stun and daze them or to injure them, with the end of the line also acting like a harpoon or spear gun, as it can pierce into the flesh of a target and pull them, which Batman notably used on one of Lex's thugs while battling them at the warehouse they were keeping Martha Kent, as well as to impale and restrain a Parademon underneath Gotham Harbor. The line could even send people flying through the air towards the user due to the force it exerted when retracting, which allowed Batman to strike his airborne target unopposed. The protrusion at the base of the gun's grip also makes it ideal to be used as a blunt weapon in close-quarters combat. As the line can be detachable, it can be used as a lasso, with Batman tying the line to Superman's leg and, with the strength of his Armored Batsuit, slung him around a large corridor and into several pillars. Batman even managed to grapple away from a superhumanly fast charge from Doomsday, as well as several of the monster's huge heat blasts. It can also shoot bullets that open up as a net, to contain enemies, as Bruce did with a Parademon.
Batman wielding his Grapple Gun
Kryptonite Spear:      Batman, brandishing the kryptonite spear  Batman utilized this weapon in his duel with Superman (almost succeeding in killing the latter with it), with it later (ironically) being used by Superman, this time against Doomsday. Due to its nature, it is one of the extremely few weapons capable of mortally wounding both Kryptonians and Doomsday.
Batman, brandishing the kryptonite spear
Colt MK IV Series 80: Batman armed himself with a Colt MK IV Series 80 pistol when leading his Insurgency against Superman and the Regime Stormtroopers in a war shown in a vision of an alternate future. He used this gun to kill an Insurgency traitor and a few stormtroopers before discarding it to use a Heckler & Koch G36C assault rifle.
FN SCAR-L: Batman armed himself with an FN SCAR-L assault rifle when leading his Insurgency against Superman and the Regime Stormtroopers in a war shown in a vision of an alternate future.
Heckler & Koch G36C: Batman armed himself with a Heckler and Koch G36C assault rifle during a fight with the Regime Stormtroopers in a war shown in a vision of an alternate future. He took this gun off a stormtrooper and used it to kill several stormtroopers before being disarmed and captured.
Batman aiming his tracking rifle
Remington 700: Batman utilized this rifle, equipped with a suppressor, to fire a tracking device onto Anatoli Knyazev's transport to track the kryptonite nugget to a LexCorp facility.
FN MK 13 grenade launcher:      Batman, using a gas grenade in combat  Batman used this to launch lead smoke grenades to temporarily evade Superman himself during their confrontation in Gotham.
CTS Model 7290M Mini Bang: Modified smoke grenades used during Batman's duel with Superman.
Kryptonite gas grenades: Grenades developed by Batman after stealing the kryptonite from Lex Luthor. These grenades emit a gaseous form of kryptonite, used against Superman to severely weaken him for roughly a minute.

Parademon plasma rifle: During the Battle of Pozharnov, Batman managed to disarm a parademon of its rifle and temporarily used it until it ran out of ammunition.
Batcomputer:      Bruce and Alfred observing data on the Batcomputer  Batman's giant and powerful multi-purpose supercomputer console, located in the Batcave, with several monitor screens. Among other things, one of its monitors is equipped with thermal imaging, allowing Batman to easily deduce the number of Anatoli Knyazev's people within a building from a distance. It is also constantly hooked up to police radio's from the Gotham City Police Department, as well as news stations, allowing Batman to be up to date with all the goings-on in his city. When Batman is on one of his vigilante escapades, Alfred sometimes utilizes the Batcomputer to help the Dark Knight with a specific task, notably when Batman saved Martha Kent from Knyazev.
Bruce and Alfred observing data on the Batcomputer
Branding Ring:      Batman, preparing to brand Luthor  Batman also has knuckle duster type device with a bat symbol on the knuckles, which superheats to the point where it can burn through flesh and even stone with ease, burning the bat-brand into the surface it is pressed or punched into. Its mechanisms are similar to that of a stapler. Batman uses it to mark the worst of criminals with his symbol for effective intimidation (notably doing so to both sex trafficker Cesar Santos, and a child predator and at least 18 confirmed others), and as a warning to others. Batman came close to branding Lex Luthor when he visited the latter in prison, but instead ended up punching a symbol into the wall behind Lex.

Cell Phone Cloner:      Bruce's cloning device  Batman, as Bruce Wayne, can use a phone capable of cloning the software and contacts of another, allowing him to both listen to the cloned phone's messages and track it. He used this on Anatoli Knyazev's phone while briefly standing close to him.
Bruce's cloning device
Hacking Device:      Bruce, plugging the hacking device into the LexCorp mainframe  Bruce plugged this device into the LexCorp servers, thus managing to tap into the mainframe and extract Lex Luthor's files on kryptonite and metahumans. This device is, however, temporarily 'borrowed' from Bruce by Wonder Woman, though she eventually returned it.

Sticky Bombs: Batman's small, custom-built hand-held explosives that can stick to surfaces before detonating. Batman hurled these onto the guns of Knyazev's men (thus instantly disabling their firearms), and later at Parademons.
Vehicles
Batmobile:      Interior of the Batmobile  Batman's imposing and heavily armed custom combat vehicle used by him for transportation, pursuit, and capture and one of his most powerful tools to aid in his war against crime in Gotham City.
Interior of the Batmobile
Batwing: Batman's aerial combat prototype vehicle with an immense amount of firepower, used by him against Doomsday. It is sometimes remotely piloted by Alfred from within the Batcave, via Batcomputer.
Knightcrawler:      Interior of the Knightcrawler  Batman's other vehicle, used to access rough terrain that cannot be reached via a car or plane. It is a four-threaded tank with each tread on a separate leg so it can walk. Its special function is that it can pierce into surfaces with each leg to climb up walls or hang from a roof.
Interior of the Knightcrawler
Flying Fox: Batman's large multi-deck airplane purpose-built to transport the Justice League around, as well as equipped to store the Batmobile.
War Machine: A custom tank used by Batman as a replacement for the Batmobile, which was destroyed during the Battle of Pozharnov.
Vision Gran Turismo: A car owned by Bruce used for his daily travels.

Trivia
A reference to Batman was shown during the final battle between Superman and General Dru-Zod in Man of Steel. A poster can be seen that says "Keep Calm and Call Batman" in a Metropolis building, which was later revealed to be the Wayne Tower in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, whose destruction proved to be a big plot point for Batman's involvement in the latter film. A Wayne Enterprise satellite also appeared during Superman and Zod's fight in Man of Steel.
According to producer Charles Roven, Batman is an extremely rough, physical person. Ben Affleck said that he identified with Batman's character in that they are both very angry people.
Batman is about 41–42 years old at the start of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice as Alfred states that he's been training in the art of deception since the age of 7 despite being unable to deceive him.
While this version of Batman is largely thought to be the most lethal, other film versions of Batman have killed or at least indirectly caused death at least once.
Batman's voice is digitally altered by a vocoder in his cowl.
In certain scenes, particularly action scenes, Batman's cape is rendered using CGI.
This version of Batman was mainly inspired by the incarnation from The Dark Knight Returns written by Frank Miller, depicting him as being older, more brutal in his fight against crime, and utilizing a durable battle armor, along with tear gas bombs filled with gaseous kryptonite and other weakening methods to combat Superman on equal footing. His main costume is also based on the costume worn by that particular incarnation. There are also some elements from the Golden Age, Arkham-verse and mainstream versions in the Batman of this continuity.
Michael Wilkinson, the costume designer of BvS and Justice League declared that Bruce studied Asian martial arts in Japan.
This version of Batman is the first and only live-action incarnation to ever show him to be near to his comics' counterpart in terms of physical prowess (despite Michael Keaton's Batman demonstrating nearly superhuman strength at some points) while accurately portraying him in terms of personality.
While the casting of Ben Affleck initially caused a controversy including the filing of an online petition, his performance was ultimately met with an extremely positive reception with most fans calling him "the best Batman ever", and other fans adoringly dubbing him "Batfleck". This eventually caused Affleck to start writing a solo Batman movie affiliated with this universe, mere rumors and news of which caused a huge and positive online and offline excitement in fans.
In promoting Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, its version of Batman (alongside Superman and Wonder Woman) in the film was added to the mobile version of DC's video game Injustice: Gods Among Us, as "Dawn of Justice Batman".
In the Injustice 2 Mobile game, his appearances in that film and Justice League are playable as "Knightmare Batman" and "Justice League Batman".
In the Injustice 2 Mobile game, his appearances in that film and Justice League are playable as "Knightmare Batman" and "Justice League Batman".
According to Richard Cetrone (Ben Affleck's stunt double in BvS), Batman also used Kickboxing, Jeet Kune Do, Kali and Professional Wrestling in the warehouse fight scene.
This version of Batman's birthday is on February 19, which might be a reference to the DC comics version, in which Batman's birthday is also February 19, however, it is possible that their birth years are different.
Batman is usually 8-years-old when he witnesses the death of his parents: However, in this incarnation, Batman was 9-years-old instead of 8-years-old when he witnessed the death of his parents.
Batman and Aquaman both have fathers named Thomas.
Batman and Superman both have mothers named Martha.
The only people who know that Bruce is Batman are the members of the Justice League, Robin, Lex Luthor, Amanda Waller, Lois Lane and Alfred Pennyworth.
Bruce is right-handed.
This version of Batman has an onscreen kill count of 21 people.
Unlike his comic book counterpart, this version of Batman doesn't seem to have a hatred towards guns and he also seems to be fine with drinking alcohol.
Batman makes a cameo appearance in the hand-drawn "imaginary" adventures in the credits of Shazam!, where he attempts to stop Billy Batson from stealing the Batmobile.
In Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn), Harley Quinn has a pet hyena named Bruce, which she named after Bruce Wayne.
Behind the scenes
On August 23, 2013, Warner Bros. announced that Affleck had been cast as Batman. Beforehand numerous actors such as Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Jensen Ackles, Josh Brolin, Joe Manganiello, Richard Armitage, Wes Bentley, Jake Gyllenhaal, Orlando Bloom, Luke Evans, Tyler Hoechlin, Jon Hamm and Gerard Butler were considered for the part.
Ben Affleck's casting initially caused somewhat of controversy and intense fan backlash including the filing of an online petition to remove him. However, upon the release of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, his performance was met with an extremely positive reception with many fans calling Affleck the best Batman of all time.
Ben Affleck portrayed the actor George Reeves in the biopic Hollywoodland. Reeves played Superman in Superman serials, making Affleck the only actor to portray both Superman and Batman.
Ben Affleck worked out every day at 5:00 AM in several gyms to become a muscular Batman. He even asked Christian Bale, who played Bruce Wayne/Batman in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, how to get into shape for the role. He also joked that Bale's advice was to get the costume makers to put a zipper on it to make going to the bathroom easier.
In the original cut of Justice League, Batman was disgraced by the killing he'd done during the events of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and was ready to sacrifice himself to make up for the lives he'd taken. However, Wonder Woman and Aquaman saved him from doing so, stating that "dying in battle won't change anything, and he must live to keep the fight going."
Batman in the DC Extended Universe is the ninth live-action incarnation of the character, following incarnations portrayed by Lewis Wilson, Robert Lowery, Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, Christian Bale, David Mazouz.
On February 4, 2019, Ben Affleck announced that he will be stepping down from the role of Batman and rumors came up that either Jake Gyllenhaal or Armie Hammer will be taking his place. However, in May 2019, Robert Pattinson was confirmed to "succeed" Ben Affleck, though his film, The Batman, takes place outside the continuity of the DCEU.
Richard Cetrone, Michael Justus, Albert Valladares, Hubert Boorder, Russell Balogh and Ben Wright were stunt doubles for Ben Affleck in the role of Batman.
In the Shazam! film, sound designer Bill Dean voiced the Batman toy when it says "I'm Batman" as Billy is throwing it at Sivana.
