<html><p>Master Escapologist: Lex Luthor, to a level that could easily put him on par with, if not superior to, Joker, is exceptionally skilled at escaping unscathed in highly unlikely situations, with him notably somehow escaping from a straight-jacket in Arkham Asylum (covertly leaving another bald inmate in his place), and from the asylum itself without anyone noticing until it was too late, and despite Batman having promised to keep constant surveillance on Lex, with Lex having enough of a head-start to comfortably retreat to a private yacht.
Master Demagogue:      Lex, having delivered his demagogic anti-Superman pitch.  Lex Luthor is a superbly skilled demagogic supergenius (more so than even Batman or Amanda Waller and comparable to Ares), as his intention is to come off as an altruistic humanist of and for the people (with Lex comparing himself to the enlightening gift-giving figure of Prometheus), so he therefore masterfully appeals to popular desires and prejudices when addressing people, often championing the cause of the common (non-metahuman) people, with his usage of seemingly rational arguments making Lex's method even more effective. Indeed, his LexCorp Industries mission statement is: "Let's build a better tomorrow today," while the specified one for Lex/Os is: "Help us build a more human system." Lex's most notable demagogic demonstrations were when he both spearheaded prolific philanthropic efforts to rebuild Metropolis and stressed that recognizing the importance of the "ordinary" non-metahuman heroes of the city (such as the countless citizens who also helped save others during the Black Zero Event) had become more important than ever in light of Superman's debut (all of which inspired Kord Industries and other corporations to follow his example, and even made many people think of Lex Luthor as being as much a hero to Metropolis as Superman himself), when Lex easily manipulates Senator Barrows into giving high-level clearance (to both the Fortress of Solitude and General Zod's corpse) without the latter even uttering verbal consent, and when Lex attempts to manipulate Senator Finch into utilizing kryptonite as a deterrent against Superman (by attempting to appeal to a fear of merely having to depend upon "the kindness" of Superman, who could potentially become a "monster"). It should be noted that Lex failed only with Finch, and only because the latter had been both a long-term adamant supporter of Superman and exceptionally perceptive. When openly discussing his motives with fellow supervillains, Lex is no less eloquent and persuasive.

Master Social Intuit: Lex Luthor, as a very outspoken humanist, has an incredible degree of social confidence and mastery in intuitively determining how to interact with others, gain their respect and get his point across with a calmness, eloquence, and charisma that belie his actual emotional state. Hence, Lex diplomatically greeted Clark Kent (despite his incredible misotheistic hatred for the latter and plot to get him killed) and Bruce Wayne (despite Batman being his enemy and business rival) upon first meeting them, remaining friendly even in the face of their wariness of him, diplomatically stated his hopes and ambitions in an interview with Ron Troupe (casually remaining unfazed by the latter's somewhat provocative questions), quickly appealed to the bitter Wallace Keefe, ignoring the latter's initial vulgar insults (despite merely desiring to use him as a disposable pawn), effortlessly maintained his diplomatic poise when being bombarded by a crowd of reporters (despite their several attempts to provoke Lex and get a rise out of him) to which Mercy Graves would commend him for having "handled it perfectly" (with Lex notably even claiming to her that there was "nothing to handle"), and cordially greeted Senators Finch and Barrows upon first meeting them and eloquently addressed them in his demagogic anti-Superman pitch (despite purely wanting to exploit them to facilitate his own machinations and the mere idea of the alien superhero being sufficient enough to enrage him) to the point that Senator Barrows became visibly intrigued by Lex and even stayed behind, intent to continue a further discussion and come to a mutual agreement with him. Even in the only two known instances when Lex makes a slight social blunder (by temporarily going into a rage when faced with Senator Finch's dissaproval, and later on being unable to improvise a captivating fundraiser speech on the spot), (the former being due to the suddenness of the Senator's disapproval surprising Lex and the latter being due to sadistic glee at all the pieces of his grand plan finally beginning to fall together), despite his feelings of dismay at both occasions, having nearly contradicted his own ideology with a paradoxical statement in the second occasion, Lex swiftly regains control of the awkward and tense situation by casually, even if tauntingly and antagonistically, leveling with Finch despite being faced with the fact that she knew his illegal actions and fixing the minor mistakes he made with his fundraiser speech with only a few words and in a matter of moments before politely excusing himself from the stage, which completely covered up his mistake and earned applause from his guests. Only when finally confronted by Superman does Lex not hold himself back in conversation for the first time, passionately expressing his immense misotheistic hatred for the alien superhero, and everything the latter represents to him. As a result, Lex remains extremely well-respected not only by his LexCorp Industries employees (especially Mercy Graves) and criminal allies, but (right up until Lois Lane exposes his supervillainous actions) even by most politicians and the general public. Following his incarceration in Belle Reve and the shaving of his head, Lex retained his social confidence and wit, remaining as effective as ever even when paired with a far more confident, cold and calculating attitude, in contrast to his previous darkly humorous persona, thus diplomatically welcoming the somewhat aloof and irascible Deathstroke aboard his private yacht, politely offering the latter a beverage while ignoring his initially cold and distasteful remarks, instead proceeding to calmly appeal to the assassin with an interesting proposition, thus managing to successfully and swiftly capture Deathstroke's undivided attention.
Master Word-Player: Lex Luthor, as a megalomaniac, is phenomenally skilled with wordplay to the point that he has the idiosyncratic ability to reveal things that he is aware of so subtly that even the most intelligent individuals could only realize what he means if he wants them to, with Lex being able to openly and smugly flaunt his knowledge to their faces while hiding the true meanings so well so as to make even people as perceptive as Batman and Senator Finch ignorant, with Lex employing witty, occasionally transpositional, puns, malapropisms, discreet black humor, and layered pop-culture references.
Master Mathematician: Lex Luthor is a phenomenally skilled supergenius mathematician being able to pick up on patterns almost all others do not notice, having a penchant to make even something as casual as sports scores sound like algebraic integers, and being able to casually tie mathematical references into conversations while remaining relevant, such as with Euclid's triangle inequality in relation to Lois Lane and Superman.
Master Scientist:      Lex, in his science attire.  Lex Luthor is an extraordinarily brilliant supergenius scientist, phenomenally skilled and knowledgeable in a vast array of scientific fields (including physics, chemistry, biology, genetics, neuroscience, computer science, psychology, and many others), even more so after absorbing new knowledge from the Fortress of Solitude's Kryptonian archives (of 100,000 alien worlds), which allowed him to correctly postulate the "Metahuman Thesis," to discover and re-purpose kryptonite as one of the few things capable of harming the Kryptonian Superman, to reverse-engineer an extremely futuristic and advanced Kryptonian Genesis Chamber from the one in the Fortress, and then successfully modify the alien corpse of General Zod into the monstrous Doomsday with his own blood, and to understand the extremely powerful and futuristic Mother Boxes' function without actually observing them (subsequently making many detailed coded notes about them and the Unity, which even Batman and Alfred proved incapable of understanding).
Lex, in his science attire.
Master Engineer: Lex Luthor is a phenomenally brilliant and prolific supergenius engineer, computer scientist, computer programmer, cryptographer and robotics technician, a wunderkind prodigy as a child, even more so after absorbing new knowledge from the Fortress of Solitude's Kryptonian archives (of 100,000 alien worlds), since his company, LexCorp Industries is the world's premiere one in high-technology defense innovation (far surpassing Wayne Enterprises, Kord Industries, Stagg Industries, Queen Industries, and Gesch√§ft-Krieg), specializing in new disruptive technologies, notably creating the revolutionary new operating system Lex/OS (the world's first neural network-based operating system), the innovative alloy bullets he provided Anatoli Knyazev with, and the high-tech lead-encased wheelchair he provided Wallace Keefe with, which allowed the bomb inside it to remain undetected even to Superman, and also able to fully understand how to utilize extremely futuristic and sophisticated Kryptonian technology (centuries more advanced than that of Earth), and even managing to successfully integrate it with his own LexCorp technology and scientific apparatus before starting the procedure of reverse-engineering the Genesis Chamber and creating Doomsday.
Master Hacker: Lex Luthor, as a prolific computer scientist and programmer, is an immensely formidable supergenius hacker, cryptographer and cybercriminal, notable for his phenomenal skills of intelligence gathering, and data interpretation, his ability to hack into most computer systems without tripping any firewalls or security, as well as his superb pattern recognition and analysis skills, with Lex therefore being able to pick up on patterns others do not notice. Hence, Lex was able to easily hack into several Gotham City CCTVs (successfully catching shots of Batman in action, despite the latter's immense stealth skills), into a Central City pharmacy's security camera (successfully catching shots of the Flash's supersonic speed), into several high-clearance NSA UUV drones in the Pacific Ocean (successfully recording Aquaman, despite the Atlantean's attempts to destroy the drones with his trident, and avoid them, with his tremendous swimming speed), into the CIA database (learning of the CIA's intention to have Jimmy Olsen infiltrate Amajagh's Nairomian forces via Lois Lane's credentials), into the highly classified S.T.A.R. Labs video log of Dr. Silas Stone (successfully capturing footage of Cyborg's enhancement by a top-secret Apokoliptan Mother Box), and also into high-clearance government facial recognition software (successfully managing to determine that the Amazon demigoddess Wonder Woman from an old World War I photo with Steve Trevor's team, is in fact still alive as the Louvre Museum antiquities curator "Diana Prince," and also learning the secret identities of both Batman and Superman). Hence, Lex swiftly becomes one of the extreme few individuals to know not only Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and Flash's secret identities (the first one to know the secret identities of the entire future Justice League), but also the first to learn practically everything about both Batman and Superman (notably their powers, abilities, physical and emotional weaknesses, relationships, and psychological profiles), which allowed Lex to discreetly outwit, manipulate, and gain the upper hand against both superheroes with ease.
Master Cryptographer: Lex Luthor is a phenomenally skilled cryptographer supergenius, since despite being so excited upon learning about the Mother Boxes and their Unity that he would write multiple detailed notes about them, he coded his writings so efficiently that even the extremely experienced Batman and Alfred were completely unable to decipher them until learning additional Mother Box lore from Wonder Woman.
Master Businessman: Lex Luthor is a phenomenally brilliant, supergenius oligarchical businessman, a wunderkind prodigy, easily the best currently alive in the world, managing to successfully transform his father's company, LexCorp Industries, from a petrochemical and heavy machinery dinosaur into a cutting-edge Fortune 500 technology giant (in a stupendous, what some call a superhuman, business feat), allowing the company to grow to massive heights and gain numerous business partners (notably quickly absorbing Hanford Technologies), which gives him a tremendous amount of oligarchical influence and respect in the business world, in addition to Lex being able to considerably expand the already massive wealth inherited by him from his father to phenomenal levels that makes him quite possibly the wealthiest man in the world ($ 2 billion), to the point where his company easily surpasses even the likes of Bruce Wayne's company, Wayne Enterprises ($97 million), along with Kord Industries's $707 million, Stagg Industries's ($628 million, Queen Industries's ($210 million), and Gesch√§ft-Krieg's $171 million in terms of wealth, R&D budget and in the field of military defense contracts, making LexCorp the world's premiere company in high-technology defense innovation and the largest tech conglomerate in the world. In fact, the astonishingly prolific genius accomplishments of Lex far surpassed even the genius business achievements of his father Alexander Luthor Sr. (which were very considerable in their own right). Unlike Bruce Wayne however, Lex is not above and is extremely skilled in secretly using ruthless cutthroat tactics, unethical practices and illegal operations (with his ties to criminal underworlds) to maintain the success of his oligarchical business empire, fooling all about his usage of dirty ethics. Indeed, Perry White feared that if threatened by Lois Lane through the press, Lex could sue the Daily Planet "out of existence" with his tremendous funds.
Master Leader: Lex Luthor is a phenomenally skilled and brilliantly talented leader, a wunderkind prodigy, having been able to spearhead LexCorp Industries with consistently tremendous effectiveness that eventually led to it being the most prominent company in the world, having the most amount of contracts even compared to the also extremely illustrious Wayne Enterprises, Kord Industries, Stagg Industries, Queen Industries and Gesch√§ft-Krieg, and inspire complete loyalty in both his criminal allies and company employees to the point that they were more than willing to risk themselves against not only the law but also individuals as powerful as Batman and Superman and lead them from the shadows completely unnoticed while efficiently coordinating their efforts to perform anonymous acts. After breaking out of Arkham Asylum, Lex is confident in his ability to bring together and lead "a league of [his] own" against Superman and the Justice League.
Master Literarian: Lex Luthor, as a famous bibliophile, has an encyclopedic knowledge of literary works, possessing vast quantities of books in his own private study, with him being particularly well-versed in American pop-culture, notably hosting a fundraiser for the Metropolis Public Library, his knowledge of the works of the library being acknowledged to the point of being famously recognized as a true friend of said library, and making numerous layered references to various books in conversation, including "The Midnight Ride," "Alice in Wonderland," "Lolita" and the "Wizard of Oz."
Master Theologian and Mythologist: Lex Luthor, despite being a militant misotheist, has an encyclopedic knowledge of both pagan (particularly Egyptian and Greco-Roman) and biblical creeds, myths, and theology, as he is able to fully understand how metahumans are the basis of many pagan myths (with Enchantress and Incubus notably inspiring the pagan myths of the ancient Pre-Columbian Maya and Incas), and he is also proficient in implementing allusions to major figures of those theologies, which he has consistently proven to have a penchant for, having compared himself to Prometheus and even the biblical God in one way, claiming to hate "the sin, not the sinner," and plays God by creating the monster Doomsday, General Zod to Icarus, commenting that the latter flew too close to the sun, and Superman to Zeus, Horus, Apollo, Jehovah, and Satan, in the face of his god-like powers. In addition to making these allusions, Lex is also able to convincingly cast these theologies' supreme gods in a not very discreet negative light (masterfully finding the right myths for that, as he did with Zeus' punishment of Prometheus), to the point that his incorporation of the latter's myth was praised by his guests and even made the usually calm Wonder Woman visibly enraged by Lex's description of Zeus and the Old Gods.
Master Political Scientist:      Lex, bribing Senator Barrows.  Lex Luthor, as an oligarchical supergenius businessman, has a phenomenal understanding of political science, such as the inner workings and intended goals of both political structures and intelligence agencies - notably the US government (whose Senate Lex easily deceived and manipulated), ARGUS (fully understanding the motives and structure of Amanda Waller's Suicide Squad pitch to the Pentagon ), and the CIA (whose covert Nairomian operation, with Jimmy Olsen, Lex easily thwarted without detection). Hence, Lex fully understood the paradigm shift that the goals of modern politics took after the emergence of Superman and metahumans, with him masterfully using this to his own benefit, by openly addressing the newfound political concerns in a demagogic speech when meeting Senators Finch and Barrows, and then effortlessly manipulating Barrows into granting him high-clearance. Indeed, Ron Troupe would go so far as to say that Lex's ideology of humanism makes the latter sound like someone running for political office.
Lex, bribing Senator Barrows.
Master Networker: Lex Luthor, as a supergenius manipulator, deceiver, and oligarch, uses a vastly dense network of professional and social contacts to further both his business and supervillain ambitions with outstanding skill. This is notable through his influence of prominent politicians (like Senator Barrows), other supervillains (like Deathstroke), other powerful companies (like Kord Industries), powerful intelligence agencies (like ARGUS, the CIA, FBI, and NSA), and formidable criminal underworlds (like Anatoli Knyazev and his men), as well as his many covert moles and pawns in various places (like Teri, Wallace Keefe, Cesar Santos, Jimmy Olsen, Kahina Ziri, Mercy Graves, and Batman) that do Lex's benevolent bidding for him, sometimes unknowingly. Hence, Lex is able to discreetly keep tabs on numerous people and things that interest him, was able to illegally smuggle in a kryptonite nugget into the United States of America (to a LexCorp facility), and have Blackgate Penitentiary inmates murder Cesar Santos in prison, without any of it getting tied to Lex. Indeed, even when imprisoned in Belle Reve supermax, and later Arkham Asylum, Lex remains confident in his vast network and indeed he managed to orchestrate his escape from Arkham Asylum by having one of his associates replace him and then quickly contact Deathstroke, offering him some extremely expensive Go√ªt de Diamants.
Master Criminologist: Lex Luthor, quite ironically, is a phenomenally skilled and knowledgeable criminologist, outclassing even Batman himself in that regard, since he was able to quickly gain tremendous insight into and understanding of Gotham City's criminals and their mindsets that rivaled, if not, surpassed that of Batman only a while after becoming interested in their activities to research more on Batman, easily understanding how Batman consistently overpowers and undermines their operations. Hence, Lex was able to keep his own supercriminal status covert so superbly that even Batman had no knowledge of it, despite having knew of his shady alliance with Anatoli Knyazev, until learning it from Superman, was able to maintain such strong ties to the criminal underworld so as to successfully use said connections to maintain the extraordinary success of his oligarchical business empire and was able to easily orchestrate multiple criminal acts without having any of it tied back to Lex, such as the death of Cesar Santos in Blackgate Penitentiary at the hands of the latter's fellow inmates.
Eidetic Memory: Lex Luthor, as a supergenius, has a photographic memory and perfect recall, which greatly aided him in mastering a vast array of eclectic fields to the highest level as a polymath, while also allowing him to make numerous layered references (to pop-culture, to biblical and pagan theology, to mathematics, to computer science, to famous books, and etc.), and to know seemingly random facts, such as the scores of recent basketball games.
Skilled Basketballer: Lex Luthor, despite his relatively short stature, is a highly accomplished basketballer, easily scoring while in his personal LexCorp basketball court, and he apparently fancies the sport and has great knowledge of it in general, quoting the score of a recent (Metros vs Guardsmen) basketball game while interviewed by Ron Troupe.
Skilled Bowler: Lex Luthor is a highly skilled bowler, confident in his ability to "destroy" Ron Troupe in a game.
Indomitable Will:      Lex, finally revealing his true colors.  Lex Luthor, much like his archenemy Superman, has tremendous determination, fearlessness, and strength of will, since he absolutely refuses to ever hunker down and give up, even when placed against seemingly insurmountable odds, with Lex mastering almost any situation with his numerous tactical contingencies, and even going so far as to claim that he doesn't know how to lose. Indeed, Lex even resolves to dominate in something as trivial as a bowling game with Ron Troupe. Hence, Lex managed to successfully transform his father's company, LexCorp Industries, from a petrochemical and heavy machinery dinosaur into a cutting-edge Fortune 500 technology giant (in a stupendous, what some call a superhuman, business feat), and being willing to use illegal operations to maintain the success of his oligarchical business empire. Later, despite the seemingly impossible task of bringing down the godlike Superman without having metahuman powers himself, Lex refuses to back down from it, and resolves to utilize his phenomenal intellect to devise complex and intricate plans to bring down his archenemy, along with back-up plans, and back-up plans to his back-up plans, for good measure, with Lex ultimately succeeding in defeating and killing Superman with his personal creation Doomsday. Indeed, Lex remains fearless and incredibly resolute even while imprisoned in Belle Reve supermax, and confronted in his cell by Batman, only showing unease at the news of being transferred to Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane, but nonetheless swiftly regaining his confidence mere seconds later even then, due to Lex having adapted a contingency plan for a break-out from Arkham (and subsequent retreat to a contingency private yacht) at the optimal time. Even after Superman is resurrected from the dead more powerful than before and cements together the Justice League, Lex is as confident as ever in face of this greater challenge, and swiftly chooses this as the optimal time to escape Arkham, retreats to the contingency yacht, and meets up with Deathstroke to discuss founding "a league of [his] own."
Lex, finally revealing his true colors.
Weaknesses
Arrogance: Lex Luthor's primary weakness is his overconfidence and arrogance (stemming from his megalomania and god complex), with him even going so far as to claim that he doesn't know how to lose. Hence, Lex does express some surprise, left temporarily caught off-guard, when an unexpected turn of events causes his plans to not work out the way he intended and he is forced to resort to one of his contingency plans. However (unlike with supervillains like Ares, Enchantress, General Ludendorff, or Amanda Waller), this weakness of his is ultimately an insignificant one, as Lex's tremendous intellect and cold calculation allow him to very effectively compensate for this at almost all times, mastering almost any situation with his numerous tactical contingencies, and he is quick to recover and seamlessly use his contingencies to make up for it. Hence, when Senator Finch unexpectedly refuses to grant Lex an import license for the Indian Ocean kryptonite, he promptly smuggles it in instead; when a guilt-ridden Kahina Ziri unexpectedly confesses her lies to Finch, Lex promptly has them both killed; when Batman and Superman unexpectedly stop their duel, team up and save Martha Kent, Lex promptly unleashes Doomsday upon them, killing Superman; when Lex's numerous unspeakable crimes get exposed and result in both Belle Reve supermax imprisonment and the possibility of execution, Lex promptly makes himself unfit to stand trial by convincingly feigning insanity; and when he learns of his unexpected transfer to Arkham Asylum, Lex regains his confidence mere seconds later, due to Lex having adapted a contingency plan for a break-out from Arkham at the optimal time - indeed, Lex chooses to break out of Arkham after Superman's resurrection and the establishment of the Justice League.
Equipment
As the CEO of LexCorp Industries, which under his leadership has become the world's largest tech conglomerate, Lex Luthor has earned himself a phenomenally large fortune (considerably expanding upon that which he has inherited from his father, Alexander Luthor Sr.), his wealth being that of $2 billion, vastly surpassing even the wealth of the other five tech conglomerates on the list of the six highest tech conglomerates in the world, such as his business rival Bruce Wayne and the Queen Industries CEO, with Lex renting the opulent Royal Penthouse Suite at the Park Metropolis Downtown (with 11 lavish bedrooms, each with its own floor-to-ceiling Italian marble bath, a 100-seat cinema/lecture hall, a four-lane bowling alley, twin helipads and its own private Caff√® Bene) just for his 15-minute interview with Ron Troupe, greatly financially contributing to the post-Black Zero Event rebuilding of Metropolis (naming the new Lexor Hotel after himself in the process), and with Perry White fearing that if threatened by Lois Lane through the press, Lex could sue the Daily Planet "out of existence" with his tremendous funds. Also, his inheritance and wealth allows Lex access to the most sophisticated technology in the world and many innovative and futuristic useful equipment, one of which included a high-tech wheelchair that he easily bribed Wallace Keefe with. These resources, along with his immensely formidable hacking (enough to discreetly learn classified secrets from the CIA, FBI, NSA, DARPA, ARGUS, and S.T.A.R. Labs databases) and exploitative networking skills (enough to influence prominent politicians, other powerful companies, intelligence agencies, and criminal underworlds), allow Lex to be extremely well-informed in regards to individuals (be they human, metahuman, or otherworldly) who could potentially pose a threat to him (allowing Lex to keep discreet tabs on all of the future Justice League members, among others), along with Lex's knowledge of many, classified, global security secrets. Hence, Lex is one of the extreme few to know the secret identities of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg, and the Flash, being one of the extreme few to know of Amanda Waller's Suicide Squad idea before it's implementation, and also being the first known human on Earth to learn the Fortress of Solitude's knowledge of 100,000 alien worlds (thus learning of Doomsday, of Steppenwolf's imminent invasion, and of the Unity). Despite having not yet regained control of LexCorp Industries following his escape from Arkham Asylum, Lex has apparently put some money  in off-shore accounts beforehand, enough to comfortably retreat to a private yacht, with a group of female bodyguards.

Yacht: An opulent private yacht, equipped with a swimming pool and a group of female bodyguards. Lex boards it after escaping from Arkham Asylum, and meets with Deathstroke in it.
Kryptonite:      Lex, examining kryptonite with fascination.  A glowing green radioactive xenomineral from the planet of Krypton, discovered in the Indian Ocean, a side effect of the World Engine's attack. As kryptonite is the greatest weakness of all Kryptonians, Lex effectively wields it against them, with him using it to peel off the fingerprints from General Zod's corpse. It is later stolen and weaponized by Batman (turned into the kryptonite spear), just as Lex had intended.

Kryptonite scalpel:      Lex operates on General Zod's corpse.  An innovative extremely sharp bladed instrument, with a blade of kryptonite xenomineral, capable of cutting right through Kryptonians, with Lex using it to peel off the fingerprints from General Zod's corpse, so as the enter the Fortress of Solitude.
Lex operates on General Zod's corpse.
Wheelchair: A fancy high-tech chair with wheels, capable of quick rotation, with Lex using it to easily bribe Wallace Keefe into testifying against Superman. As noted by Jenet Klyburn, the wheelchair was composed of the same innovative unknown metal alloy as the LexCorp bullets, while its interior was lined with lead (so as to render the bomb concealed within invisible to Superman's X-ray vision).
Innovative alloy bullets: Sophisticated high-caliber bullets, produced by LexCorp Industries, and supplied to Anatoli Knyazev and his men by Lex, used by them in Nairomi. As noted by Jenet Klyburn, they are composed of an unknown innovative metal aloy.
Lex/OS:      Lex/Os' Beta Test login.  Revolutionary new high-speed computer operating system developed by LexCorp (it's mission statement being: "Help us build a more human system"), the world's first neural network-based operating system, capable of gradually becoming more and more intelligent each time human beta testers volunteer.
Lex/Os' Beta Test login.
CCTVs: Many video cameras that Lex has a penchant for setting up in locations of interest, in order to watch events unfold from within his private room in the LexCorp facility. He has thus successfully spied on Batman, Professor Garcia's footage of Superman, research on the corpse of General Zod, as well as the Fortress of Solitude. He is later revealed to have also successfully spied and kept tabs on the Amazon demigoddess Wonder Woman, the Atlantean Aquaman, the speedster Flash, and the mechanically-enhanced Cyborg, with Lex dubbing them all "metahumans."

Trivia
Lex coined the terms "metahuman" and "kryptonite".
Lex, Superman, Deathstroke, and Shazam share the same middle name: "Joseph."
Lex was listed as the youngest person ever to be named Fortune's Businessperson of the Year and included on the magazine's list of the World's 50 Greatest Leaders in the since-deleted Fortune article, "Lex Luthor Jr.: Not Just His Father‚Äôs LexCorp".
Justice League showed Lex Luthor recruit Deathstroke to join a version of the Injustice League/Legion of Doom to take down the champions of Earth.
Behind the scenes
This version of Lex Luthor is inspired by the comics Adventure Comics #271 and Superman: Birthright as well as real life Silicon Valley CEOs.
When initially imprisoned in Belle Reve, Lex is given the designation "AC 23 1940". This appears to be a reference to the 23rd issue of the Action Comics comic series which came out in 1940. This issue was noteworthy for, among others, being the first chronological appearance of Lex Luthor.
Lex is 31 in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, four years younger than Superman, when in most forms of media, he is either slightly or much older than Superman.
Before Jesse Eisenberg was casted as Lex Luthor, Tom Hanks were in early talks for the role of Lex Luthor. Later on Matt Damon, Bradley Cooper, Joaquin Phoenix, Adam Driver and Jean Dujardin were on the final shortlist for the role.
According to Zack Snyder, they discussed the possibility for Lex Luthor to play a part in saving the Earth from Darkseid in a planned third Justice League film. His role would have involved him sacrificing himself to detonate a nuclear bomb within Darkseid's spaceship.
Jesse Eisenberg was uncredited for his appearance in Justice League.
Lex Luthor in the DC Extended Universe is the seventh live-action incarnation of the character, following incarnations portrayed by Lyle Talbot, Gene Hackman, Scott James Wells, Sherman Howard, John Shea, Michael Rosenbaum, and Kevin Spacey.
In July 2019, Jesse Eisenberg confirmed that he is "done" playing Lex Luthor, Eisenberg stated, "Do I have anything left on the table? No, never. No. But I loved it. I mean, I loved every moment of it. It was great. I would not have thought of myself for it. So, to me, it was all, like, house money I would call it."
T. Ryan Mooney was a stunt double for Jesse Eisenberg in the role of Lex Luthor.
