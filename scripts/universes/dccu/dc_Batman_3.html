<html><p>Peak human agility:      Bruce running through Metropolis   Batman's athletic prowess grants him exceptional agility, coordination, and balance while fighting and evading others. Batman is incredibly nimble and agile, and has demonstrated high levels of agility and dexterity. He was able to perch on a wall to avoid arriving police officers, followed by quickly moving across ceilings and walls with almost ape-like acrobatics, dodging the point-blank gunfire from a GCPD police officer's shotgun effortlessly, with the officer unable to get a glimpse of Batman, as the Dark Knight's speed and agility made him appear as blurs of motion. His mobility allows him to move away from the sight of others and stalk enemies from the shadows or higher vantage points. Hence, Batman was able to swiftly somersault over a cornered crook with almost inhuman agility. He also managed to remain unscathed while breaking into LexCorp's Metropolis facility, despite the guards trying to shoot him and himself leaving a considerable path of destruction. He also effortlessly brought down Knyazev's 24 men at once using his combat skills and strength, appearing as blurs due to his incredible speed. Also, Batman could jump several meters into the air over a large crate while slamming a man into it (after lifting him into the air with him while he was jumping), easily balance himself while standing on the back of a stone gargoyle, and dodge many Parademon plasma bolts while grappling into their midst. Even while wearing his Armored Batsuit, the heaviest of his suits, Batman was still able to move at considerable speeds, even being able to intercept an attack from the partially recovered and flying Superman and outmaneuver him to pin him to a wall, though against a full-power Superman, he couldn't react to even a single one of the many blows Superman landed on him. He was even able to dodge Doomsday's superhumanly fast charge and his blasts.
Bruce running through Metropolis
Peak human stamina: Batman's highly trained and developed body generates far fewer fatigue toxins than an ordinary human, superior in that regard to the finest Olympian athlete, able to exert himself at his peak capacity for several hours without tiring or slowing down. Hence, Batman was able to easily dispatch 24 armed thugs with intense speed (despite being fatigued from his recent duel with Superman), followed by actively participating in the final battle against Doomsday. He was able to run through the cloud of falling debris during the Black Zero Event, and to routinely perform extremely intense workouts in the Batcave without tiring much. Batman can also recover extremely fast from injuries and fatigue due to his training and indomitable will. However, when pitted against beings of far superior strength (like Superman) in hand-to-hand combat, Batman will increasingly show signs of exertion and fatigue even while wearing his Armored Batsuit.
Peak human metabolism: Batman's metabolism runs several times faster than an average human's due to his strict diet and incredible workout regimen, this allows him to have a near inhuman metabolism, healing, immune system, and longevity. Thus, binge drinking has no effect whatsoever on him, as Bruce's body burns it off several times faster than an average human's, despite him drinking several bottles at a time, to which Alfred dryly remarked that the next generation of the Wayne family will inherit an empty wine cellar.

Batman fighting against a Parademon
Master martial artist: Batman is an extraordinarily skilled hand-to-hand combatant, an infamously formidable master in multiple forms of martial arts (including boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, Karate, Muay Thai, Taekwondo, Savate, Eskrima, Krav Maga, Jeet Kune Do, Ninjutsu, Kung Fu, Judo, and Aikido), with 20 years of experience battling and overpowering numerous criminals and supervillains in Gotham City. His fighting style also incorporates and takes full advantage of his proper use of physical forces, momentum, and leverage, as well as his knowledge of anatomical weaknesses and pressure-points, combined with his nigh-superhuman strength, executing it all at very high speeds. Hence, while attending an underground fight club, Bruce easily analyzes the fighting style of one of the fighters for him to give an advice to his opponent, which allowed said fighter to easily defeat his foe. With his tremendous combat skills, aided by his strength, Batman effortlessly brought down Anatoli Knyazev's 24 armed henchmen in an impressive amount of time (despite being very tired after his fierce duel with Superman right before), has easily brought down the Joker multiple times along with at one point effortlessly thwarting Harley Quinn's attempt to stab him and then defeating her with a single punch, can outmaneuver even physically stronger opponents, like Parademons, and brought down numerous Regime Stormtroopers, until ultimately succumbing to their sheer numbers (though this occurred in a vision of a possible future where he was somewhat older and weaker). When Superman's powers were temporarily weakened to human levels from kryptonite gas, Batman was able to quickly overwhelm him in hand-to-hand combat with superior fighting skills, easily countering his attacks and landing punishing blows on the also considerably skilled superhero, even outmaneuvering a partially recovered Superman to temporarily restrain and pummel him. Batman is the one who defeated most of the future Suicide Squad members (even the infamously lethal assassin Deadshot, whom Batman swiftly outclassed in close quarters), having them placed behind bars in Belle Reve. His incredible combat skill, combined with his agility, was sufficient enough to easily overpower several inhumanly strong Parademons, swiftly disarming and incapacitating them in close quarters. Batman's skills would also allow him to successfully mentor his protégé vigilante Robin into becoming extremely skilled combatants in their own rights.
Batarang mastery:      Batman wielding a batarang in a fight   Batman is a master of throwing projectile weaponry with great accuracy and pinpoint precision, such as his signature batarangs. He notably uses them to disarm his opponents, such as when he knocked a detonator out of Firefly's hand. He can also use them with lethal force, such as during the Rescue of Martha Kent, when he quickly threw one into the chest of an assailant. When Batman recruited the Flash to the Justice League, he skillfully threw one past him to alert the latter to his presence. His proficiency in wielding his batarangs is reminiscient of shurikenjutsu, befitting his status as a ninja. He is on par with (and may even surpass) Captain Boomerang.

Expert marksman: Batman is skilled with conventional firearms like pistols, rifles, sniper rifle, grenade launcher, and grapple guns, using them with a high degree of accuracy and precision (almost on par with that of Deadshot), notably shooting a tracker onto Knyazev's truck from a great distance. In his nightmarish vision of a possible future, Batman was highly proficient with conventional firearms in close quarters, wielding both a handgun and an assault rifle, as well as repeatedly disarming Regime Stormtroopers of their assault rifles, using them as his own. When Wonder Woman restrained Doomsday, Batman was able to shoot a kryptonite gas grenade at the monster from an immense distance away, further demonstrating his exceptional accuracy. Batman possesses the same accuracy when utilizing the guns of his vehicles, notably neutralizing a number of Anatoli Knyazev's criminal convoy with his Batmobile, and later his Batwing, as well as shooting down many attacking Parademons with his Knightcrawler and Flying Fox.
Master spy: In addition to being an incredible detective and a world-class fighter, Batman is extremely skilled in espionage, intelligence gathering, stealth, infiltration, and sabotage, capable of breaching high security facilities without being detected. Batman's stealth is so effective in fact, that some criminals would claim that you wouldn't even know he was there until it was already too late. Batman's remarkable speed and almost ape-like agility allow him to move away from the sight of others and stalk enemies from the shadows and higher vantage points, while letting them catch glimpses or hear his cape (having a penchant for gliding down upon his enemies from above, like an actual bat), thus giving them the illusion of Batman being a supernatural, wraith-like creature instead of a human. Hence, Batman was easily able to sneak up from behind even on the extremely experienced assassin Deadshot (catching the latter off-guard), to infiltrate a LexCorp Industries building and obtain the well-guarded kryptonite within (swooping down upon and seriously injuring most of the guards, leaving behind a considerable path of destruction), to sneak into Barry Allen's apartment, and to even sneak into the Belle Reve supermax jail cell of Lex Luthor, and disappear from it just as suddenly when Lex briefly turned away. Batman used the flickering red lights and caused the cell doors to open, making himself to appear to be a demon or wraith. When utilizing a specially designed gaseous lead grenade, Batman's amazing stealth is further augmented to the point that he was able to temporarily evade Superman himself. Later, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Cyborg were able to swiftly slip away when Commissioner Gordon turned away for a moment, and even Flash was left incredulous at how he didn't notice his teammates leave, despite having superhuman reflexes and standing right beside them.

Master intimidator: Batman commands an extremely fearsome presence, able to instill fear into the hearts of Gotham City's criminals and supervillains, with some of them not even daring to shoot him after Batman fiercely gazes them in the eye. After Batman rescues several female hostages from a sex trafficker, they are so terrified of the dark vigilante, that they refer to him as a "Devil", and fearfully refuse to leave their cage even after the police arrive on the scene. Hence, Superman would initially go as far as to call Batman "a one-man reign of terror". Among the extremely few individuals who do not fear Batman, are the pathologically fearless psychopath Joker, bold supergenius Lex Luthor (only showing momentary uneasiness when Batman first confronted him and when he told him that he had arranged for the latter to be incarcerated in Arkham Asylum), his long-time ally Commissioner Gordon, and beings of superior godlike power, such as Superman, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman, though his profound experience in intimidation tactics allowed him to remain unintimidated even in the proximity of their fearsome presence, as shown by how he remained calm when both Superman and Aquaman tried to frighten him (even countering Superman's threat with his own) and defiant even after Wonder Woman harshly shoved Batman back to remind him she could easily kill him if she wanted to after he insulted her beloved Steve Trevor's memory. He even managed to apparently intimidate Superman as he was about to kill the weakened superhero, as Superman thought he was going to die at the hands of the armored vigilante, though this might have instead been Superman fearing that Martha Kent would be impossible to save if Batman killed him, as the time that Lex had given her was running out. However, even Batman was notably less intimidating than the evil version of Superman (first in his nightmare vision of a possible future, and then right after his resurrection, with post-mortem amnesia), who was so fearsome that Batman himself showed visible signs of fear when Superman confronted the vigilante, holding the latter at his mercy. Batman also showed signs of fear when his armored punches began to lose effectiveness against Superman (due to the kryptonite weakening wearing off), and later when an enraged, amnesiac Superman ruthlessly held him by the neck and mockingly repeated the same threat Batman once made to him.
Genius-level intellect: Batman is an extremely intelligent and eclectic polymath genius, to the point that he has successfully gone toe-to-toe with the extremely dangerous, inventive and completely unpredictable psychopath Joker for years. Hence, Batman's brilliant intellect is arguably his greatest and most formidable ability of all, as it extends itself to his nearly unparalleled tactical, deceptive, detective, criminology, scientific, engineering, hacking, combat, exploitative networking, and business skills, which (coupled with his extensive experience utilizing them all) therefore makes Batman the most eclectically intelligent member of the Justice League. However, Batman is notably not quite as intelligent as supergenius Lex Luthor, with the latter thereby successfully outsmarting and manipulating Batman into obtaining kryptonite and genuinely attempting to kill Superman, with Batman never suspecting that he was in fact Lex's pawn, and figuring it out only after his duel with the alien superhero had ended. It should, however, also be noted that it was his cynical and pessimistic side and extremely distrusting nature (due to 18 years of pain, losses and exhaustion) which finally took over Batman's moral psychology and sense by the time of the Black Zero Event, which contributed to Lex easily outsmarting him.
Master tactician: Batman is an extremely formidable tactical and strategic genius, often using cunning and planning to effectively assess combat situations and come up with effective strategies, and successfully outwit stronger and more powerful foes, rather than simply out-fighting them, using any of their exploitable weaknesses to his advantage. Hence, Batman is by far the best tactician among the Justice League, with only supergenius Lex Luthor being known to surpass him and while the completely unpredictable Joker, an extremely skilled tactician in his own right, was capable of at times staying one step ahead of him, Bruce has successfully managed to go toe-to-toe with him nevertheless for years and had even managed to capture Joker twice, even when Joker had managed to kill Robin along with Harley Quinn. He was able to swiftly make a mental breakdown of the fighting style and weaknesses of one of the fighters in an underground Gotham City fight club (helping his opponent swiftly beat him by whispering some combat advice), was able to swiftly defeat the notorious Deadshot by ambushing the latter in his daughter Zoe's presence (exploiting his unwillingness to kill in front of her), was able to chase the stronger Killer Croc out of Gotham City (exploiting the latter's limited intellect), was able to formulate a plan to break into the well-guarded LexCorp Industries building and steal the kryptonite within (overpowering the many guards by swooping down upon them with his incredible stealth skills, seriously injuring them all, and leaving behind a considerable path of destruction), was able to quickly improvise a plan to take down Anatoli Knyazev's 24 heavily armed men in a warehouse while saving Martha Kent (swiftly avoiding and disabling their weapons, and proceeding to use his own weapons and tremendous combat skills to overpower them, while also using their own knives and guns against them), was ultimately able to defeat the far more powerful Superman in their fierce duel (exploiting his weakness to kryptonite, lead, and sonic overload, as well as his unwillingness to kill Batman), managed to render the far more powerful Doomsday vulnerable to attack (exploiting the monster's limited intellect and tremendous bloodlust, baiting him into getting restrained by the Lasso of Hestia, and thus giving Superman an opening to exploit the monster's weakness to kryptonite), held out with his Insurgency for a lengthy time in the war against the more powerful Regime (in a vision of a possible future), lured a Parademon out into the open (exploiting their ability to sense fear by dangling a crook off a roof nearby), concocted a complex plan to infiltrate Scout Ship 0344 and resurrect Superman, had a feasible contingency when Superman returned from the dead as an amnesiac monster (by having Lois Lane come to the scene and spark his memory), came up with the plan to separate the Apokaliptan Unity once more and defeat Steppenwolf (by personally distracting the Parademon army while Cyborg and Superman pried the Mother Boxes apart), and was confident in his ability to protect Amanda Waller from the US intelligence community finding out about her catastrophic error concerning Enchantress in Midway City.
Master detective: Batman is an immensely formidable detective genius, capable of observation, forensic investigation, and psychological assessments, as well as both inductive and deductive reasoning of the highest caliber and has been claimed by many to be the "world's greatest detective". Hence, Bruce was able to deduce that Superman's parents (Jor-El and Jonathan Kent) had told him that the latter was on Earth for a reason (despite knowing little about the alien superhero's past), and Bruce knew that the Gotham City Museum of Antiquities' sword of Alexander the Great was in fact a fake replica, and he was quickly able to see through the "babe in the woods act" of Diana Prince, discerning something suspicious about the mysterious foreign antiques dealer right away, refusing to allow Diana's remarkable beauty to cloud his judgement and free her of his suspicion, unlike what a vast majority of men would have done. Bruce also effectively utilized his detective skills, using Amanda Waller's metahuman files to track down and recruit the speedster Flash, to learn of Anatoli Knyazev's connection to the "White Portuguese", Lex Luthor and kryptonite, as well as the latter's secret research on metahumans. When encountering Parademons, despite knowing little of them, Batman was able to deduce their ability to sense fear, and used that to lure one out into the open. When visiting a village frequented by Aquaman, Batman was able to correctly deduce that the former was among the crowd of villagers before him, due to it being the day right after the King tide (the time of year when Aquaman arrived, as Waller's files stated). In addition, when learning of the Mother Box's abilities, Batman was able to swiftly deduce that one of them would be able to resurrect Superman from the dead.     Bruce's arrogant, womanizing playboy façade  
Master deceiver: Batman is an immensely formidable deceptive genius, a wunderkind prodigy, with Alfred even going so far as claiming that Batman's skills in the art of deception, ever since the age of 7, have been equivalent to Mozart's in music, with only Lex Luthor being known to surpass Batman in deceptive skills. Hence, as Batman, he has been effectively able to fool the people of Gotham City (especially the criminal underworld) into thinking that he is inhuman and supernatural (with female sex trafficked victims notably mistaking him for a "Devil", and Cyborg initially doubting that Batman is even real), while as Bruce Wayne, he had been able to take on the façade of a somewhat irresponsible fun-seeking and womanizing playboy, in order to avoid anyone from suspecting that he could possibly be Batman. Bruce also successfully deceived Anatoli Knyazev (distracting the Russian with a polite conversation, while discreetly cloning the contents of his phone), Mercy Graves (tricking her into thinking that he was drunk, managing to thus avoid suspicion during his attendance of Lex's fundraiser party), and Superman (whom he ambushed with the unexpectedly potent kryptonite weapons). However, Batman had notably never been particularly skilled at deceiving Alfred Pennyworth (the one person who knew Bruce best, having raised the latter from his childhood), and was unable to deceive supergenius Lex Luthor, who was quick to see through the Dark Knight's inhuman and supernatural façade, thereby deducing (via CCTV) that Batman is actually only a mere man without any metahuman powers.
Expert social intuit: Batman, both as Bruce Wayne and a vigilante, has a great degree of social confidence, making him highly skilled in intuitively determining how to interact with others, gain their respect and get his point across with a calmness, eloquence, and charisma that sometimes belie his actual, usually gloomy, emotional state. Hence, Bruce diplomatically greeted Lex Luthor (who he had suspicions of, given the latter's shady alliance with Anatoli Knyazev), calmly confronted Diana Prince (despite his rage at being thwarted in his attempt to gain data on kryptonite), verbally leveled with Diana when she showed her comparable intellect, and even remained fairly calm when meeting Clark Kent and discussing his brutality as a vigilante in contrast to the more heroic Superman, (keeping his composure even in the face of Clark's somewhat unjustified belief of him being a brutally unforgiving vigilante, retaliating with a calm but distasteful remark regarding Daily Planet's tendency to speak good about Superman and his belief that Superman could very well be a threat after a brief moment of cold anger, which successfully caused Clark dismay, and responding to Clark's statement that the world doesn't share his opinion with a non-aggressive, albeit cold, mention of the psycopathic Joker and Harley Quinn). As Batman, he had successfully maintained a working diplomatic relationship with the Gotham authorities, getting them to trust him to be Gotham's protector, and despite the extreme temptation to brand Lex, he was just able to resist and instead resorted to coldly gloat to Lex that he will be imprisoned in Arkham Asylum, along with lashing out not at Lex but at the wall with his branding ring even when the latter gloated about Superman being dead. Indeed, Alfred Pennyworth is one of the extreme few individuals with whom Bruce doesn't hold himself back in conversation, notably when he passionately expressed his motives for within to destroy Superman. As a result, Bruce remains extremely well-respected at Wayne Enterprises by Greg, Grace, Jack O'Dwyer, and even his embittered former employee Wallace Keefe, who proudly proclaimed his loyalty to Bruce Wayne after his arrest.     Wayne, observing his kryptonite weapon  
Master engineer: Batman is an immensely formidable genius in vehicles' operations and general engineering, since his company, Wayne Enterprises is the world's 6th leading company (after LexCorp Industries, Kord Industries, Stagg Industries, Queen Industries, and Geschäft-Krieg) in high-technology defense innovation, with Batman and Alfred having personally built and over time improved upon his various sophisticated gadgets, most notably, the Batmobile, Standard Batsuit, and Batcomputer. Bruce later personally designed the Armored Batsuit, as well as the innovative kryptonite gas grenades and a kryptonite-tipped spear, all of which proved enough for Batman to ultimately defeat Superman. When recruiting Barry Allen, he successfully identified the composition of the Flash suit and knew it was material used on the space shuttle to prevent it from burning upon reentry. After establishing the Justice League, Batman constructs the highly sophisticated Knightcrawler and Flying Fox, as well as creating a new and updated Flash suit for Barry Allen, and even deducing from Wonder Woman's story that a Mother Box would be able to resurrect Superman from the dead.
Master hacker: Batman is an extremely skilled genius hacker, notable for his exceptional skills of intelligence gathering, and data interpretation, as well as his superb pattern recognition and analysis skills, with only supergenius Lex Luthor known to surpass him. Hence, Batman was notably able to utilize his sophisticated Batcomputer to hack into both GCPD police radios and Gotham City news stations (being constantly hooked up to both, so as to be up to date with all the goings on in his city), and into Lex Luthor's military-grade encrypted data on kryptonite and metahumans (while Lex actually intended to have Batman hack into it, the encryption was genuine, so as not to make Batman suspicious of being Lex's pawn). Batman also eventually learned of Amanda Waller's Suicide Squad pitch to the Pentagon, discovered the original photograph of Steve Trevor's team (promptly sending it to Diana Prince at the Louvre Museum), and even promised to protect Waller from the US intelligence community learning of her error in Midway City. Batman usually utilizes the Oracle Network, in order to most effectively hack and gather data from the Batcomputer.
Master leader: Batman (although not on the level of Lex Luthor in brilliance and as he admits, Superman in terms of charisma) is an extremely skilled leader, able to successfully lead and spearhead Wayne Enterprises very successfully for decades, making it become among the world's most prominent companies, notably being the 6th leading company in high-technology defense innovation, to masterfully lead his vigilante protégé Robin in numerous successful vigilante escapades and missions, only losing Robin in all the years he spent fighting crime along with his proteges, to lead the Insurgency against Superman's Regime for a lengthy amount of time despite the superior military power of Superman's organization (in a vision of a possible future), and to later successfully lead the Justice League's original roster against Steppenwolf's Parademon invasion. Indeed, despite Aquaman's initial gruff refusal, the initial insecurity of both Flash and Cyborg, and Batman's own doubts (as he knew that Superman would have been a better leader for them), they all ultimately came to look up to Batman as the team leader, and developed a healthy team dynamic. When Flash remarks on his inexperience, many fears, and questions his value to the team, Batman helped him gain confidence with some simple advice. In addition, despite Wonder Woman initially not being receptive, Batman ultimately inspires her to become a better leader and a better superhero overall.     Bruce Wayne at Wayne Enterprises  
Master businessman: Bruce Wayne is an immensely formidable brilliant genius businessman (though not quite on par with oligarch Lex Luthor and the CEO of Kord Industries, Stagg Industries, Queen Industries, and Geschäft-Krieg), successfully running his father's company, Wayne Enterprises, for decades with tremendous efficiency, helping the company grow and gain more business partners (notably quickly absorbing Van Criss Laboratories, and purchasing the bank that intended to gain the Kent farm), as the CEO and amassing a tremendous amount of wealth (over $97 million), despite his refusal of military contacts. As a result, Bruce is extremely well-respected in the business world, being known for having his employees' loyalty as well as his impeccable business ethics, with Wayne Enterprises becoming the world's 6th leading company (after LexCorp Industries, Kord Industries, Stagg Industries, Queen Industries, and Geschäft-Krieg) in the field of high-technology defense innovation under his leadership.
Master criminologist: Batman is an extremely skilled and experienced criminologist, at least equal with Commissioner Gordon, having great insight into and understanding of Gotham City's criminals and their mindsets, which allows him to consistently overpower and undermine their operations with extreme effectiveness. Batman's skills, however, are not on par with Lex Luthor, as even with him being aware of the latter's shady alliance with Anatoli Knyazev, he was still unable to fully deduce that Lex was in fact a covert supercriminal.
Expert interrogator: Batman is infamously adept in interrogation techniques, often using law enforcement methods, as well as torture (notably branding a Gotham City sex trafficker, Cesar Santos, along with 18 known other criminals) as an effective means of punishment or information extraction.
Expert networker: Batman, as an influential businessman, experienced vigilante, and interrogator, superbly uses a dense network of professional and social contacts to further both his business and superhero ambitions. This is notable through his influence of the police (like the GCPD, through Commissioner Gordon and the Batcomputer), other companies (like Van Criss Laboratories, through Wayne Enterprises), powerful intelligence agencies (like ARGUS, through Amanda Waller), and certain prisons (like Arkham Asylum, through his "friends" there). Hence, Batman is able to discreetly keep tabs on numerous people and things that interest him, was able to gain the GCPD's trust, to swiftly uncover Dr. Van Criss' nano-bomb usage against the Suicide Squad for Waller, to get Barry Allen a forensics job in Central City, to help Clark and Martha Kent keep their Kent farm, to arrange that Lex Luthor gets transferred from Belle Reve supermax to Arkham Asylum (also promising Lex that he would be watching him "whatever he does, wherever he goes"), to threaten Amanda Waller into shutting down her Squad (unless she wishes for Batman's Justice League friends to "shut it down for [her]"), and was even able to promise Waller protection against the US intelligence community (so as to avoid them finding out about her catastrophic error in judgement concerning Enchantress in Midway City).
Multilingualism: Bruce, apart from his native English, also speaks fluent Russian (albeit with a slight accent), as seen in his conversation with Anatoli Knyazev, and Icelandic as well, as seen in his visit to Aquaman.
Master tactician: Batman is an extremely formidable tactical and strategic genius, often using cunning and planning to effectively assess combat situations and come up with effective strategies, and successfully outwit stronger and more powerful foes, rather than simply out-fighting them, using any of their exploitable weaknesses to his advantage. Hence, Batman is by far the best tactician among the Justice League, with only supergenius Lex Luthor being known to surpass him and while the completely unpredictable Joker, an extremely skilled tactician in his own right, was capable of at times staying one step ahead of him, Bruce has successfully managed to go toe-to-toe with him nevertheless for years and had even managed to capture Joker twice, even when Joker had managed to kill Robin along with Harley Quinn. He was able to swiftly make a mental breakdown of the fighting style and weaknesses of one of the fighters in an underground Gotham City fight club (helping his opponent swiftly beat him by whispering some combat advice), was able to swiftly defeat the notorious Deadshot by ambushing the latter in his daughter Zoe's presence (exploiting his unwillingness to kill in front of her), was able to chase the stronger Killer Croc out of Gotham City (exploiting the latter's limited intellect), was able to formulate a plan to break into the well-guarded LexCorp Industries building and steal the kryptonite within (overpowering the many guards by swooping down upon them with his incredible stealth skills, seriously injuring them all, and leaving behind a considerable path of destruction), was able to quickly improvise a plan to take down Anatoli Knyazev's 24 heavily armed men in a warehouse while saving Martha Kent (swiftly avoiding and disabling their weapons, and proceeding to use his own weapons and tremendous combat skills to overpower them, while also using their own knives and guns against them), was ultimately able to defeat the far more powerful Superman in their fierce duel (exploiting his weakness to kryptonite, lead, and sonic overload, as well as his unwillingness to kill Batman), managed to render the far more powerful Doomsday vulnerable to attack (exploiting the monster's limited intellect and tremendous bloodlust, baiting him into getting restrained by the Lasso of Hestia, and thus giving Superman an opening to exploit the monster's weakness to kryptonite), held out with his Insurgency for a lengthy time in the war against the more powerful Regime (in a vision of a possible future), lured a Parademon out into the open (exploiting their ability to sense fear by dangling a crook off a roof nearby), concocted a complex plan to infiltrate Scout Ship 0344 and resurrect Superman, had a feasible contingency when Superman returned from the dead as an amnesiac monster (by having Lois Lane come to the scene and spark his memory), came up with the plan to separate the Apokaliptan Unity once more and defeat Steppenwolf (by personally distracting the Parademon army while Cyborg and Superman pried the Mother Boxes apart), and was confident in his ability to protect Amanda Waller from the US intelligence community finding out about her catastrophic error concerning Enchantress in Midway City.

Master engineer: Batman is an immensely formidable genius in vehicles' operations and general engineering, since his company, Wayne Enterprises is the world's 6th leading company (after LexCorp Industries, Kord Industries, Stagg Industries, Queen Industries, and Geschäft-Krieg) in high-technology defense innovation, with Batman and Alfred having personally built and over time improved upon his various sophisticated gadgets, most notably, the Batmobile, Standard Batsuit, and Batcomputer. Bruce later personally designed the Armored Batsuit, as well as the innovative kryptonite gas grenades and a kryptonite-tipped spear, all of which proved enough for Batman to ultimately defeat Superman. When recruiting Barry Allen, he successfully identified the composition of the Flash suit and knew it was material used on the space shuttle to prevent it from burning upon reentry. After establishing the Justice League, Batman constructs the highly sophisticated Knightcrawler and Flying Fox, as well as creating a new and updated Flash suit for Barry Allen, and even deducing from Wonder Woman's story that a Mother Box would be able to resurrect Superman from the dead.
Master hacker: Batman is an extremely skilled genius hacker, notable for his exceptional skills of intelligence gathering, and data interpretation, as well as his superb pattern recognition and analysis skills, with only supergenius Lex Luthor known to surpass him. Hence, Batman was notably able to utilize his sophisticated Batcomputer to hack into both GCPD police radios and Gotham City news stations (being constantly hooked up to both, so as to be up to date with all the goings on in his city), and into Lex Luthor's military-grade encrypted data on kryptonite and metahumans (while Lex actually intended to have Batman hack into it, the encryption was genuine, so as not to make Batman suspicious of being Lex's pawn). Batman also eventually learned of Amanda Waller's Suicide Squad pitch to the Pentagon, discovered the original photograph of Steve Trevor's team (promptly sending it to Diana Prince at the Louvre Museum), and even promised to protect Waller from the US intelligence community learning of her error in Midway City. Batman usually utilizes the Oracle Network, in order to most effectively hack and gather data from the Batcomputer.
Master leader: Batman (although not on the level of Lex Luthor in brilliance and as he admits, Superman in terms of charisma) is an extremely skilled leader, able to successfully lead and spearhead Wayne Enterprises very successfully for decades, making it become among the world's most prominent companies, notably being the 6th leading company in high-technology defense innovation, to masterfully lead his vigilante protégé Robin in numerous successful vigilante escapades and missions, only losing Robin in all the years he spent fighting crime along with his proteges, to lead the Insurgency against Superman's Regime for a lengthy amount of time despite the superior military power of Superman's organization (in a vision of a possible future), and to later successfully lead the Justice League's original roster against Steppenwolf's Parademon invasion. Indeed, despite Aquaman's initial gruff refusal, the initial insecurity of both Flash and Cyborg, and Batman's own doubts (as he knew that Superman would have been a better leader for them), they all ultimately came to look up to Batman as the team leader, and developed a healthy team dynamic. When Flash remarks on his inexperience, many fears, and questions his value to the team, Batman helped him gain confidence with some simple advice. In addition, despite Wonder Woman initially not being receptive, Batman ultimately inspires her to become a better leader and a better superhero overall.     Bruce Wayne at Wayne Enterprises

Master businessman: Bruce Wayne is an immensely formidable brilliant genius businessman (though not quite on par with oligarch Lex Luthor and the CEO of Kord Industries, Stagg Industries, Queen Industries, and Geschäft-Krieg), successfully running his father's company, Wayne Enterprises, for decades with tremendous efficiency, helping the company grow and gain more business partners (notably quickly absorbing Van Criss Laboratories, and purchasing the bank that intended to gain the Kent farm), as the CEO and amassing a tremendous amount of wealth (over $97 million), despite his refusal of military contacts. As a result, Bruce is extremely well-respected in the business world, being known for having his employees' loyalty as well as his impeccable business ethics, with Wayne Enterprises becoming the world's 6th leading company (after LexCorp Industries, Kord Industries, Stagg Industries, Queen Industries, and Geschäft-Krieg) in the field of high-technology defense innovation under his leadership.
Master criminologist: Batman is an extremely skilled and experienced criminologist, at least equal with Commissioner Gordon, having great insight into and understanding of Gotham City's criminals and their mindsets, which allows him to consistently overpower and undermine their operations with extreme effectiveness. Batman's skills, however, are not on par with Lex Luthor, as even with him being aware of the latter's shady alliance with Anatoli Knyazev, he was still unable to fully deduce that Lex was in fact a covert supercriminal.
Expert interrogator: Batman is infamously adept in interrogation techniques, often using law enforcement methods, as well as torture (notably branding a Gotham City sex trafficker, Cesar Santos, along with 18 known other criminals) as an effective means of punishment or information extraction.
Expert networker: Batman, as an influential businessman, experienced vigilante, and interrogator, superbly uses a dense network of professional and social contacts to further both his business and superhero ambitions. This is notable through his influence of the police (like the GCPD, through Commissioner Gordon and the Batcomputer), other companies (like Van Criss Laboratories, through Wayne Enterprises), powerful intelligence agencies (like ARGUS, through Amanda Waller), and certain prisons (like Arkham Asylum, through his "friends" there). Hence, Batman is able to discreetly keep tabs on numerous people and things that interest him, was able to gain the GCPD's trust, to swiftly uncover Dr. Van Criss' nano-bomb usage against the Suicide Squad for Waller, to get Barry Allen a forensics job in Central City, to help Clark and Martha Kent keep their Kent farm, to arrange that Lex Luthor gets transferred from Belle Reve supermax to Arkham Asylum (also promising Lex that he would be watching him "whatever he does, wherever he goes"), to threaten Amanda Waller into shutting down her Squad (unless she wishes for Batman's Justice League friends to "shut it down for [her]"), and was even able to promise Waller protection against the US intelligence community (so as to avoid them finding out about her catastrophic error in judgement concerning Enchantress in Midway City).
Multilingualism: Bruce, apart from his native English, also speaks fluent Russian (albeit with a slight accent), as seen in his conversation with Anatoli Knyazev, and Icelandic as well, as seen in his visit to Aquaman.
Expert driver: Batman is a highly skilled and evasive patrol driver, able to successfully pursue his enemies (most notably the Joker and Harley Quinn in the Smiley Car, as well as Anatoli Knyazev and his men) through the streets of Gotham City on his Batmobile, and also managed to navigate the extremely dangerous streets of Metropolis during the Black Zero Event in his civilian car, successfully avoiding falling debris.
Expert pilot: Batman is also very proficient at combat piloting, able to effectively fight Doomsday himself from within his Batwing, albeit only temporarily, and to later break down Steppenwolf's Apokalyptan dome with his Flying Fox.
Expert rider: Batman is a highly skilled horseback rider, shown when he travels across the tundra terrain of Iceland, in an effort to reach the village frequented by Aquaman.</p></html>
