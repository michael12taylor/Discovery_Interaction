<html><p>Indomitable will: Superman has tremendous determination and strength of will, since he refuses to ever hunker down and give up, even when placed against seemingly insurmountable odds. Hence, despite being badly outmatched and outnumbered in his fight against the combined efforts of Faora-Ul and Nam-Ek, his battle with the World Engine's gigantic gravity beam, and his final duel with General Zod, and taking a tremendous beating from all of them, Superman promptly rose up and kept on fighting, persisting until he eventually managed to gain the upper hand. Indeed, Superman's will was even greater than that of Batman and Wonder Woman, since the former ultimately strayed away from superheroism after undergoing hardships, and the latter stepped away from full-time superheroism for 100 years after a traumatic war experience, while Superman only stepped away into self-imposed exile for a few days after a similarly traumatic experience, and returned to save a world than had forsaken him. Thus, Superman persisted in getting through to Batman, and later refused back down when faced by the stronger and more powerful Doomsday, proceeding to team up with Batman and Wonder Woman to take the seemingly unstoppable monster down, persisting with his utmost until Doomsday was defeated, persisting even after being himself mortally stabbed by the monster, persisting defiantly up until his own dying breath (to further plunge his weapon into Doomsday), much to Batman and Wonder Woman's admiration and respect. In fact, Superman's determination and willpower were so great, that he was even able to temporarily overcome the weakening and superpower negation effects of the kryptonite spear for several seconds, long enough for him to fly up to Doomsday and plunge the weapon into the monster. Wonder Woman was astounded to have finally, after 100 years, meet a person who had both the phenomenal godly might of Ares, and the self-sacrificing morality of Steve Trevor. Indeed, Batman claimed that Superman is a "beacon to the world," one who doesn't just save people, but also "made them see the best parts of themselves." This was a consistent trait in Superman, which allowed him to inspire Pete Ross (who had previously bullied him) to become a good man, to inspire Lois Lane to do the right thing (despite her previously just wanting to publish the alien's story), to gain the trust and respect of General Swanwick and Colonel Hardy (despite them initially being gruff, fearful, xenophobic, and not even seeing him as human), to inspire Dr. Hamilton to risk his life to defeat the Kryptonian invasion (despite him usually being shy and soft-spoken), to inspire Perry White to risk his life saving his DP employees (despite him usually being gruff and controlling), to inspire Steve Lombard to risk his life saving Jenny Jurwich (despite him usually being sleazy and unfriendly), to gain the respect of the US Armed Forces and inspire them to give his superhero nickname (despite them initially being hostile, fearful, and xenophobic towards him), to inspire the brutal fallen Batman to snap out of his rage and once again become a selfless superhero (despite him having initially wanted to kill the alien), and also to inspire the cynical and almost hopeless Wonder Woman to finally become a full-time superhero again (despite her having stepped away 100 years ago). Indeed, the only time Superman ever failed to inspire a flawed individual to "see the best parts of himself" and do a heroic deed was when he saved Lex Luthor from Doomsday since despite this disproving Lex's main reason for hating God and Superman, Lex was already too far gone and too malevolent an individual to change his ways. Superman's powerful will even allowed him to resist the Anti-Life Equation's powers and he was only broken when the grief he felt over Lois's death allowed Darkseid to brainwash him. Superman's evil version (in Batman's nightmare vision of a possible future) is equally determined, successfully enforcing his totalitarian will on Earth with his Regime Stormtroopers, and eventually leading the Regime to a crushing victory in the Injustice War against the Insurgency, successfully intimidating and killing Insurgent leader Batman.
Free will: Being a Kryptonian born of biological reproduction, Kal-El possesses a more complete and higher free will than his fellow men and even his parents, although the latter have completely broken the boundaries of their engineered DNA thinking, but they did not have enough free will as much as their son. Jor-El had in fact predicted that his son might have the right to choose to protect humanity or have Krypton be reborn on Earth. Kal-El, despite initially wanting to be with his fellows, chose to protect Earth and side with humans when he learned of the Kryptonians' apocalyptic plan to extinguish humanity to save Krypton and rebuild it on Earth. Because of his superior free will, he was looked down upon by his fellow creatures, who are artificially born with a specific purpose to fulfill, while he was free to decide without anyone's imposition what purpose or destiny he can pursue; above all, Faora accused him of being weak and insecure, due to his high morality, which artificially born Kryptonians with a purpose have never had. Kal-El, unlike his other Kryptonian companions, who lacked the ability to genetically move forward once their purpose is lost, is able to go on to pursue his purpose of protecting Earth from the threats that follow, even when much of the world has abandoned him, due to the manipulations of Lex Luthor, despite having withdrawn temporarily for a few days in solitude to reflect on his purposes to follow, unlike other metahumans who have hidden for years, because of their fear of not being accepted by society. It is thanks to his free will that he eventually returned from his self-isolation to save the world from Doomsday, despite the fact that he had to risk his life by dying in the process. Another aspect of his free will is that he could choose which planet to stay with, whether with Krypton or Earth, as demonstrated when he briefly hesitated to destroy Scout Ship 0344 because unborn Kryptonians could die, but at the same time he didn't want the Kryptonians conquered Earth for a planet that had been destroyed decades ago, so Kal-El chose to side with Earth, as Krypton had already had his chance and they wasted it.

Weaknesses
Kryptonite: Superman is vulnerable to the effects of Kryptonite, a radioactive xenomineral created by the World Engine. It can weaken or even kill him if exposed to it for a prolonged period of time or if he is impaled with a shard of it.
Magical/divine weapons: Weapons of magical origin such as the Sword of Athena and the Trident of Atlan, can hurt and kill Superman. He can also be restrained (albeit temporarily) by the Lasso of Hestia, and is susceptible to its truth compulsion.
Equipment
Weapons
Kryptonite spear: Originally created to be used against him, Superman used the spear to kill the behemoth Doomsday during their showdown in Gotham City.
Other equipment
Clark in glasses
Glasses: Kal-El possesses a pair of glasses he dons whenever he poses as the mild-mannered Clark Kent.
House of El command key: Clark once possessed a piece of Kryptonian technology made of liquid geo that allowed him to operate and use the abandoned Kryptonian ship found in the Arctic. A gift from his father, the key held within it the artificial intelligence program of Jor-El's conscious self. He wore it around his neck as a pendant during his years searching for his origin. The key was sucked into the Phantom Zone along with his infant pod and the Black Zero.
Kal-El's personalized skinsuit
Supersuits: Clark wears a black Kryptonian skinsuit as the superhero Superman. He previously wore a blue skinsuit with a red cape. The suits were crafted from an immensely durable material, and are adorned with the House of El glyph on its chest, the original in red, and its replacmeent in silver. The initial suit was damaged during the Showdown in Gotham Port against Doomsday, before he later donned the second suit to take down Steppenwolf.
Kal-El's second skinsuit
Growth Codex: Kal-El's cells have been bonded to the Kryptonian growth codex by Jor-El, which contain the genetic makeup of over a billion Kryptonians. As revealed by Jax-Ur, it was still possible to extract the codex's information from Kal-El's body even if he were dead.
Vehicles
Starcraft: As a baby, Kal-El was placed into a small starship equipped with a phantom drive, which his parents used to send him to Earth. The starship was used again later in his life to send the Sword of Rao back to the Phantom Zone.
Scout Ship 0344: Clark discovered the ancient Kryptonian scout ship frozen deep in an ice shelf in Canada, and he later took possession of it. He used the ship as a temporary base of operations while learning of his origins from the stored consciousness of Jor-El. The ship, also known as the Fortress of Solitude, contains a damaged genesis chamber with aquabots, though Clark was forced to severely damage its systems it when General Zod commandeered the vessel during the Black Zero Event. Afterwards the ship fell into the temporary possession of the United States government and was exploited by Lex Luthor. The ship was then claimed by Silas Stone and his S.T.A.R. Labs colleagues.

Trivia
Henry Cavill is the first non-American actor to play Superman.
Superman is currently the third oldest member of the Justice League, being younger than Batman and Diana Prince.
Clark's birth year is listed as 1986 in the Daily Planet article, "Daily Planet Reporter Clark Kent killed reporting Gotham Battle". General Dru-Zod had already confirmed his birth year to be no later than 1980, so this likely a mistake.
Along with his parents, the only people who know Clark Kent is Superman are General Zod, the Sword of Rao, Lois Lane, the Justice League, Alfred Pennyworth, Father Leone, and Lex Luthor.
Clark is right-handed.
Superman being able to match the Flash's speed doesn't quite fit in with the common concepts of DC. Usually, speedsters are described to be considerably faster than solar-powered Kryptonians.
Behind the scenes
Before Henry Cavill was cast as Superman, Matthew Goode, David Boreanaz, Joe Manganiello, Armie Hammer, Matt Bomer, Zac Efron, and Colin O'Donoghue were on the final shortlist for the role.
Superman in the DC Extended Universe is the tenth live-action incarnation of the character, following incarnations portrayed by Kirk Alyn, George Reeves, David Wilson, Christopher Reeve, John Newton, Gerard Christopher, Dean Cain, Tom Welling, and Brandon Routh.
Brandon Routh, who had previously played the character in Superman Returns, was still open to returning to the role despite Man of Steel being a full-on reboot. Routh would ultimately reprise his role in the Arrowverse crossover event Crisis on Infinite Earths.
At the time of Man of Steel's release, the tie-in novel Man of Steel: The Early Years: Junior Novel had been the first to depict the first future event in the DCEU timeline, showing Superman many years after the events of the film saving Metropolis from an earthquake. (Since the scene is described as "many years after" this automatically rules out the events of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice which is set one year and 6 months later, likely set sometime after the films Justice League and Zack Snyder's Justice League, which are set only two years after).
D. J. Cotrona would have played Superman in the cancelled Justice League: Mortal.
Paul Darnell and Albert Valladares were stunt doubles for Henry Cavill in the role of Superman.
