The Enchantress was an ancient and inter-dimensional mystical being, who possessed the body of June Moone after the latter inadvertently freed her from her imprisonment. 

Initially under Amanda Waller's control, Enchantress was viewed as one of the candidates for Task Force X membership, but the malevolent witch swiftly escaped, freeing her brother Incubus and attempting to take over Earth with their combined mystical powers. In the end, however, Enchantress and her brother are killed by the combined efforts of Task Force X and the U.S. military during a final fight in Midway City.

Biography
Age of prehistory
Hailing from another dimension, Enchantress and her brother Incubus entered this plane of existence circa 4,358 B.C., over a millennium before the War of the Gods. Due to their incredible power, Enchantress and Incubus were worshiped as gods by ancient humans of Pre-Columbian South America but were ultimately betrayed by her subjects and somehow defeated and sealed away into containers, which, in turn, were placed inside a tomb of Tres Osos Caves for millennia.

Return of Enchantress
Reawakening
Archaeologist Dr. June Moone was exploring a site along the long overgrown Tres Osos Caves in the north-central highlands of Peru when she fell a shaft into a cavern containing a tomb. A doll-shaped container that held the witch caught her eye and called to her, making her release the spirit of the ancient deity. The spirit then possesses June's body, inhabiting her normal self until she says the word "Enchantress", upon which her normal consciousness is overtaken by the ancient spirit inside.

June Moone becoming Enchantress
It is not long before she comes to the attention of Amanda Waller during her search for metahumans for the United States government. She sends her subordinate Colonel Rick Flag to apprehend her and watch over June. Not before long June and Rick fall in love, fulfilling Waller's intention to attain leverage over both of them. Meanwhile, Waller sends people to locate the tomb in which June was possessed and find the spirit's "heart", the only thing capable of controlling it. Once in Waller's possession, she has the power to control the Enchantress.

When Waller approaches the government for approval to form the Task Force X, June accompanies her to turn herself into the Enchantress in front of the committee to convince the members of the use of harnessing criminals and metahumans for military purposes. She uses her teleportation abilities to warp to Iran and obtain a highly sought-after file containing the Iranian nuclear arsenal inventory as a gift to impress the otherwise terrified staff. Waller is then given their authorization.

Freeing Incubus
Soon after, June transforms into the Enchantress during her sleep while in Midway City. As this happened, she made Rick Flag hallucinate seeing June Moone on her deathbed, forcing him to keep his mouth shut about her plans. She teleports away to Waller's room and opens another vial, which contains the spirit of her brother Incubus. She goes to Midway City and incapacitates a man, Gerard Davis, in the subway for Incubus to use as a host once she releases him. She tells him to wait and build up his powers. When the time came, Incubus attacked the Midway City subway, absorbing many people to restore his true form and destroying trains. The efforts of the U.S. military and local police to "contain" him failed dramatically, with the first responders were wiped out by Incubus' tentacles.

Building a superweapon
Enchantress after waking up
Waller then sends June Moone and Rick Flag to destroy Incubus, but the attempt turns into an opportunity for Enchantress to escape and join her brother instead. Although without her heart, and thus unable to bring the full extent of her powers to bear, Enchantress is saved from an apparent death under Waller's hands and is restored to her more healthy form by her brother sharing his power with her. She is then more than capable enough to begin creating her army and an extremely powerful mystical superweapon. Stepping outside, she begins channeling arcs of lightning into the sky. While Incubus continues to wreak havoc in the city and destroy the military's attacks against them, he also contributes to the superweapon by lifting the wreckage of buildings and destroyed military equipment to the "ring" now hovering above Midway City. The military is soon forced to evacuate and call up the rest of the Task Force X against this new threat.

Enchantress standing between her Eyes of the Adversary minions
Having created monstrous Eyes of the Adversary minions by converting humans in Midway City, Enchantress dispatched them to capture Amanda Waller. After her helicopter was taken down, Incubus ordered that he be brought his sister's heart, which he proceeded to levitate into her chest. Absorbing it and the power to finally finish her weapon, Enchantress began breathing intensely, her eyes only flitting open when Waller was brought directly before her by a demon. When she refused to comply and goaded her to show her her worst, Enchantress ignored her and attached the woman to her superweapon, to destroy the armies and weapons of the modern world. Without resistance, she would be able to take over the world again.

Battle of Midway City
Enchantress talking with Task Force X.
Once Task Force X arrives, Enchantress attempts to convince them to ally themselves with her to be granted their desires. She compounds her offer with telepathic visions placed into the minds of Rick Flag, Harley Quinn, Deadshot, and El Diablo, but Diablo can power through his vision, having come to terms with his accidental murder of his family. Surprised at Diablo's exceptional mental fortitude, Enchantress calls upon Incubus to force the Squad to bow to her. Enchantress watched as El Diablo transformed into a huge flaming avatar to battle her brother. Then, Rick Flag had the bomb she abandoned earlier detonate, killing both Diablo and incubus. Somewhat weakened without her brother, a devastated Enchantress reverts to her ashier previous form, to defeat the group herself.

While the Squad was initially able to somewhat hold their own against the witch, Enchantress ultimately got tired of their resistance and telekinetically knocked their weapons away, offering them a final chance to serve her. Harley Quinn appeared interested, wondering if she could bring back the Joker, who seemed to have been killed in a helicopter crash. Enchantress claimed that she could resurrect him, and happily accepted Harley's servitude, but was subsequently taken by surprise when Harley cut out her heart with Katana's sword, giving Rick Flag and the Squad a chance to destroy the superweapon. A weakened Enchantress desperately attempted to stop Deadshot from shooting down her superweapon by giving him a vision of his daughter Zoe Lawton begging him not to make the shot. Deadshot, however, managed to tearfully power through the vision and brought the superweapon down with a single shot.

Defeat and death
Moone and Flag reuniting
A fallen Enchantress begs Katana to kill and thus reunite her in death with Incubus. Flag, however, holds Katana back and orders Enchantress to return June Moone's body to her, threatening to otherwise kill her (by crushing her heart), but the witch refused. A devastated Flag recalls June's plea to kill her if that means destroying Enchantress, so he tearfully crushes Enchantress' heart, killing the witch once and for all. Moments later, June Moone emerges, ripping Enchantress' skin and clothes off of herself.

Personality
Because of her "godly" status in the world, Enchantress developed a God-complex, having been worshiped as a deity over the years in various places. Because of this, she is understandably very eager to conquer the modern world with her mystical powers, once she possesses June Moone, frees herself from Amanda Waller, and frees her brother. Her personality prior to being betrayed and imprisoned is unknown, but she was worshipped along with her brother by the global population and they clearly work well together as leaders so it can be assumed she was a benevolent and competent ruler. Like Incubus, Enchantress was vastly confident in her ability to renew and redeem humankind and this coupled with her powers made her impossible to intimidate. They also gave Enchantress extreme pride in her status as one of the oldest living metahumans, making her confidence reach the point of arrogance following her return and inducing her to take into account that people worshiped her. Much like Steppenwolf, she believed power was the only real law which made the earth her right and that humans were currently too weak to see the truth, seeing them as redeemable and genuinely desiring their love instead of their fear, sincerely pitying Task Force X for the cruelty their captors showed both them and her, and holding tyrants such as Amanda Waller in contempt (ironically despite sharing her superiority complex). Thus, she takes great pleasure in showing off her powers (such as when she treated her unwilling clash with Task Force X like it was a deadly dance before decisively ending it with a hand gesture) and firmly believes that it is the metahumans' destiny to inherit the Earth from their human oppressors, believing that the events of recent years are a sign that they are ready to rise against “those who cage [them]”.

Although she did not hesitate to do what was necessary to cleanse and renew the world and thus showed no remorse for using June as a vessel or bringing down modern constructs such as buildings or roads, Enchantress only did anything harsh or questionable to serve the greater good, being aware sacrifices would have to be made for evolution in any form, and as a result she did not exercise violence needlessly, as best shown with her ignoring Waller's taunts and her horrible memories of Waller's cruelty and simply knocking her out and throwing her aside (closing her eyes to ensure she doesn't feel any real pleasure in seeing Waller's incapacitation), and even demonstrated a more tender side to her such as when she softly held Incubus as she explained what was going on, politely encouraged Task Force X to come talk to her directly, and encouraged Harley she was a woman of her word (being unaware her loyalty to her and her sentiment towards her boyfriend were both smokescreens). Because of her empathy for the descendants of her loyal subjects, Enchantress was willing to allow certain humans, provided that they were useful or amusing, such as Deadshot or Harley Quinn to have high places in her otherwise metahuman-filled ranks and even was willing to make offers to them (such as her offer to Harley to resurrect the Joker, who was her presumed deceased lover), provided they agreed to join her and accept her as their mistress. Sadly, it is because of her mercy that she is relatively easily outsmarted by the cunning, yet far less powerful Harley Quinn, which allows Enchantress to be defeated.

Inevitably, Enchantress is vastly intelligent and has a well-managed temper. Despite being around for a few weeks at best, she seemed to understand what the b-word meant when Waller used it and what Harley meant when she said she “lost her pudding”. She is also cunning in her own right, notably creating a large army of humans whom she converted into Eyes of the Adversary, the better to bring people under her control, albeit mostly those who tried to kill her and her brother such as the Police Department or US Armed Forces. She also managed to use Rick Flag's love for her host, June Moone, to keep him quiet about her vanishing (to free Incubus) by showing him a vision of June dying. Her plan to free Incubus and “bolt” during the early stages of Task Force X's deployment shows her skills as a tactician.

Enchantress deeply loves her brother Incubus; they are about as close as two siblings can be and shared their ambition to revolutionize society. Although she tended to be the ringleader in their revolution, they still did just about everything together, with her helping him adjust to the 'new world' and trusting him enough to risk her neck leaving Waller knowing he reciprocated her love and was strong enough to save her. After Incubus' death at the hands of Task Force X, she is devastated and, upon her posterior defeat, expresses a desire to be reunited with him in death.

Despite coming across on several occasions as being arrogant and genuinely self-centered, Enchantress, like her brother, has ultimately always had good intentions, as both of them genuinely believed that their actions were what was best for humanity as a whole, and for the sake of recreating civilization for them after destroying the one they had replaced their own with, to in their eyes cleanse an egregiously corrupt world, though their strong convictions were arguably not misplaced. She also showed an almost informal disrespect for current world leaders who had taken the earth in her absence, sexually straddling a board member, frequently giving Waller dirty looks and mockingly asking her a rhetorical question about the way her “armies” could fall (even smirking about it), and making Rick Flag hallucinate that June Moone was on her deathbed.

Apart from having a condescending and almost sassy attitude around her enemies, Enchantress is also shown to have a very mischievous side to her such as the time when she deliberately pressed the button to live explosives only seconds after Rick Flag had instructed her how to detonate them before teleporting away while laughing. As well as caressing a board member condescendingly and deliberately jump scaring Gerard Davis for seemingly no reason other than her amusement by appearing in a bathroom mirror before grabbing his head through the mirror and smashing it into the glass, all before transferring her brother's mind and soul into his body. All of this indicates that the Enchantress has a very twisted sense of humor. Somewhat ironically this makes her very similar to Harley Quinn, the one who ultimately renders her defeat possible. She even shows a childlike excitement to restore the old ways and laughs excitedly before flying into June's mouth and later looks astounded by her own physical transmutation just before the revolution began.

Curiously, Enchantress refers on two occasions to intending to “wipe out” humanity despite frequently mentioning she wants to resume her reign over them. Her reasons for such phrasing are unclear, although it is definitely possible her anger towards the people for falling so low without her may have simply manifested in this choice of words showing she was clearly still hurt by her past regarding whomever turned on her and her brother.

Powers and abilities
Powers
Mystical energy manipulation: Enchantress is a fearsome inter-dimensional mystical being, with her and her brother Incubus having been worshiped in the past as gods, and Amanda Waller claims that Enchantress and her brother are the most powerful metahumans that she has ever come across, with Enchantress nearly overpowering the combined might of Task Force X single-handedly. However, while extremely powerful, and although she was worshiped as a goddess by the ancient Pre-Columbian Maya and Incas, Enchantress was notably not quite as powerful as an actual Old God.

Possession: Enchantress was able to possess June Moone after the latter released her from her container.
Transformation: June Moone, due to being possessed by Enchantress, can willingly switch between her normal form and her demonic form of Enchantress, which also gives Enchantress control over her body. She triggers this transformation by saying the word "Enchantress".

Superhuman strength: Enchantress, while not as physically strong as her brother Incubus, still has a degree of superhuman strength (roughly equal to that of Killer Croc), allowing her to battle the entirety of Task Force X at once, knocking her opponents back with her powerful blows.
Superhuman durability: Enchantress has superhuman durability, being unfazed by a mighty blow from Harley Quinn's baseball bat, many bullets of Deadshot, and even the superhumanly strong attacks of Killer Croc. However, Harley was notably able to cut Enchantress's chest open with Soultaker, and she was considerably weakened after standing close to her exploded mystical superweapon.
Telepathy: Enchantress can produce clear tendrils from her spine that can burrow deep into peoples' minds, revealing their closely-kept secrets. She used this ability on Amanda Waller to uncover military secrets, enabling her to destroy a secret military base (among other high-value targets). According to Enchantress, resisting this ability is painful and fruitless, making it very similar to the Lasso of Hestia. Moreover, she can sense nearby minds.
Hypnosis: Enchantress can implant hypnotic visions of alternate events into the subconscious of any human near her, thus convincing Deadshot that he defeated and killed Batman (instead of Batman defeating and arresting him), convincing Harley Quinn that she and the Joker were a happily married couple with 2 children (instead of being forcibly separated), and convincing El Diablo that his wife and children were still alive and a happy family (instead of him having accidentally killed them in a fit of rage). However, a person with exceptionally strong willpower and mental fortitude can overcome the hypnosis, with El Diablo thus breaking free, and continuing his attack against the mystical siblings. Her abilities also failed to influence Deadshot when she projected an illusion of his daughter, Zoe Lawton in front of him, hypnotizing him into stop fighting Enchantress.
Illusion casting: Enchantress, when attempting to persuade Harley Quinn to join her, claims that in exchange she will resurrect her lover Joker (who was presumed to be dead) back to life. She also offers Harley a normal life with Joker, a scenario to Deadshot where he kills Batman, and the return of Diablo's family.

She also offers Harley a normal life with Joker, a scenario to Deadshot where he kills Batman, and the return of Diablo's family.
Historical sight: Enchantress can peer into the past and view events that already occurred as if they are occurring in her presence. She uses this ability to look into several potential Task Force X members at the behest of Amanda Waller to help Waller determine the layout of her team.
Teleportation: Enchantress can teleport herself over virtually any distance in seconds, and upon Amanda Waller's order, was able to teleport to a secret weapons vault in Tehran, Iran, and steal a top-secret binder and teleport back to Waller's board room, all within mere seconds.
Telekinesis: Enchantress was able to telekinetically disarm Task Force X members of their weapons with a single hand gesture, as she was annoyed by the team's persistence in fighting her.
Intangibility: Enchantress can somewhat phase herself through solid objects, as she notably ambushed Gerard Davis while herself seemingly within a mirror, and stretching out her (re-solidified) hands from the mirror for the attack.
Weather manipulation: Enchantress can control the weather, and can produce lightning, thunder, rain, snow, storms and so on.
Electrokinesis: Enchantress can generate electric currents, and also can absorb the electricity.
Electrokinesis: Enchantress can generate electric currents, and also can absorb the electricity.
Longevity: Enchantress, much like an Old God, is capable of living for millennia, being 6,373 years old (thus being born long before the War of the Gods) by the time she is finally killed, by Rick Flag.
Abilities
Gifted Intellect: Enchantress is exceptionally intelligent, given her tremendously long lifespan, and is notably smarter than her brother Incubus. Enchantress' intellect extends to her tactical and deceptive skills, though her immense arrogance and God complex occasionally clouded her judgment.
Expert Tactician: Enchantress is quite adept at using cunning and planning to outwit her enemies. After June Moone accidentally transforms into the Enchantress during her sleep while in Midway City, she teleports away and releases the spirit of her brother Incubus, as a long-term plan to escape from Amanda Waller's captivity. Hence, after releasing him, she tells Incubus to wait and build up his powers. When her brother starts wreaking havoc, Waller (unaware of Incubus being her brother) sends Enchantress to stop him, which gives her the perfect opportunity to escape and betray Waller and Task Force X and join her brother, who saved her when Waller tried to kill Enchantress (by damaging her heart). However, Enchantress' arrogance and superiority complex occasionally make her tactics imperfect, which is what allowed Harley Quinn to ultimately trick and undermine her.
Bilingualism: Enchantress speaks her native ancient language while addressing her brother Incubus, and is also fluent in English.

Bilingualism: Enchantress speaks her native ancient language while addressing her brother Incubus, and is also fluent in English.
Master Combatant: Enchantress is an extremely skilled armed and hand-to-hand combatant (most likely having centuries of combat experience). Her skill was such that she swiftly overpowered the combined might of Rick Flag, Deadshot, and Harley Quinn, and even the immensely formidable samurai warrior Katana was only able to hold her own against Enchantress for a limited time, though that might have been primarily due to the latter's superior strength, coupled with her rapid teleportation every so often (to avoid Katana's sword slashes).
Sword Mastery: In battle, she can summon two swords, using them with great efficiency. She was even able to fight Katana, a master swordswoman in her own right, though her opponent proved to be a better sword duelist, forcing Enchantress to fall back on her teleportation.
