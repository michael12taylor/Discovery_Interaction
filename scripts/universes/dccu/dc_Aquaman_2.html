<html><p>Master Swimmer: Aquaman, like all Atlanteans, is an extremely skilled swimmer, though Nuidis Vulko had to train him to swim like an Atlantean as well, with Arthur thus learning to quickly propel himself from water, like a dolphin.
Equipment
Weapons
Trident of Atlan: Arthur currently possesses the Trident of Atlan as the new ruler of the underwater kingdom, Atlantis.
Atlanna's trident: Aquaman's first weapon, it once belonged to his mother Atlanna, former Queen of Atlantis, who left him the trident after her departure. This weapon is extremely durable and capable to cause serious injury to even powerful beings, such as the new god Steppenwolf. In addition, the trident is also able to help Aquaman control water, with him notably holding off the torrential force of a wave by repelling it with the trident. The trident seemingly appears to somewhat enhance Aquaman's speed while underwater, causing a massive shockwave of force as he fled from the NSA's UUV drones. The trident was eventually broken by Orm during the Duel in the Ring of Fire.
Other equipment
Aquaman wearing his suit
Atlan's armor: After having found the Trident of Atlan, Arthur also took the attire of Atlan, as the new bearer of the trident. This suit includes pants, boots and green gloves and the shirt that covers the chest and abs of bright golden color. Later, he started using the suit as his heroic alter-ego, "Aquaman."
Atlantean armor: After Steppenwolf's invasion of Atlantis, Aquaman donned an ancient suit of Atlantean armor to face the New God and his army of Parademons.
Arthur's gladiator armor: During his battle with Orm, for the throne of Atlantis, Arthur took part in a duel, which also included a helmet to protect his skull. After escaping from Atlantis following his defeat, he stopped wearing the armor.
Vehicles
Flying Fox: Aquaman, among with the Justice League, travel to Pozharnov, Russia with the Flying Fox.
Mera's ship: Aquaman and Mera use this ship to go to the Kingdom of Atlantis.

Trivia
ARGUS has been monitoring Arthur Curry since the age of 20.
The Atlantean tribal tattoos on Aquaman are modelled after and inspired by actor Jason Momoa's own Polynesian tattoo.
He is the only member of the Justice League to have two surviving parents.
While hiding in the dark of the wrecked ship, he displayed blue colored eye-shine, similar to raccoons, cats, and dogs.
Aquaman and Batman both have fathers named Thomas.
This is the first version of Aquaman not to be blonde, though his hair does have blonde highlights.
Arthur is right-handed.
Arthur was named when Thomas saw the news on Hurricane Arthur on television, although it is strongly implied it was inspired by his father's fondness for the legacy invoked by King Arthur. Coincidentally, in real life, his possible birth year of 1979 (stated by his file in Suicide Squad, but contradicted by the Aquaman which shows him being born during or after 1985) was the first year when this was technically possible on the Atlantic coast where he lives, as it was the first year when both male and female names are used for hurricanes, and previously only female names were used. However, Atlantic hurricanes start with a female name on odd-number years, in the case of 1979, it was Tropical Storm Ana, and the first Pacific hurricane was Hurricane Andres. Additionally, it is meteorologically improbable for a hurricane to form in January as tropical cyclones are fueled by the energy of warm oceans; the strongest hurricane on record to form in January only reached category 1. "Hurricane Arthur" is said to be a category 4, the earliest of which in history is Hurricane Dennis, formed in early July.
In the Injustice 2 Mobile game, he is playable as two separate characters, "Justice League Aquaman" and "King of Atlantis Aquaman," based on his appearances in Justice League and Aquaman respectively.
Aquaman is commonly misidentified as a Metahuman due to Humans not knowing of the existence of Atlantis.
Aquaman is one of the DCEU characters who appears as a player skin in Fortnite. He was introduced in Chapter 2, Season 3, and his regular (Arthur Curry) and armored appearances are unlocked via challenged unlocked with the purchase of a Battle Pass.
Behind the scenes
