<html><p>Peak human condition: Harley Quinn, as a highly skilled and experienced supervillain and gymnast, is in top physical condition (from frequent villainous escapades with her ex-boyfriend the Joker) for a woman her age, to the point that she could hold her own against the formidable Eyes of the Adversary troops of Enchantress. She is muscular and fit, but notably far weaker than her nemesis Batman, who subdued her without much effort. Regardless, she is still in great physical condition and Mateo Suarez even referred to her as a soldier.
Peak human strength: Harley is strong for someone of her stature. She is able to knock down men twice her size, and is also strong enough to break human bones. She was able to easily run while holding a heavy bag of dog food under one arm, and was later easily hoisted it into the air with one hand. While she was tortured in Corto Maltese, she lifted a man with her legs in addition to her own bodyweight and snap his neck.
Peak human durability:     Harley withstands being hit by a car   While not on Batman's level, Harley is extremely sturdy by human standards. She was able to break her fall out of Joker's helicopter, withstand a blow from Incubus, endure being kicked into a car door with enough force to subsequently rip it off, and endure being hit by a car and launched into the side of a van before falling to the ground and remain conscious. While she was tortured in Corto Maltese, she was Tasered several times before falling unconscious, although she may have been pretending to be out.
Peak human agility: Harley is incredibly nimble and agile, being able to perform complex flips, maneuvers, somersaults, and various other acrobatic acts.
Peak human metabolism: Not only can Harley Quinn hold vast quantities of alcohol, but she also remained conscious after being shot in the neck with a tranquilizer dart by Victor Zsasz. While rescuing Cassandra Cain from the GCPD, Harley inhaled a small amount of cocaine, with its effects only lasting for a short while before wearing off.

While rescuing Cassandra Cain from the GCPD, Harley inhaled a small amount of cocaine, with its effects only lasting for a short while before wearing off.
Master combatant:     Harley Quinn fights off two thugs at once   Harley Quinn is a highly skilled and formidable armed and hand-to-hand combatant. Although she has no formal training in hand-to-hand combat, it could be due to her years of fighting by Joker's side. When in a fight, Harley uses her acrobatic skills to best her opponents. Harley was able to seriously injure five Belle Reve guards before finally being restrained in an extra secure cell. She also quickly overpowered two far larger Eyes of the Adversary troops of Enchantress in rapid succession with nothing but her agility, combat skills and baseball bat. However, she was swiftly defeated by Batman, with the latter knocking her out with a single mighty punch, and by Enchantress in their final battle. She was able to fight Renee Montoya, an experienced hand-to-hand fighter in her own right. When raiding the GCPD, she was able to take down numerous trained police officers and other criminals in lockup with a combination of acrobatic kicks, swings from her bat, and the use of her custom-made non-lethal grenade launcher. When at the abandoned amusement park, she was able to take out most of Black Mask's thugs singlehandedly while on roller skates. When escaping from her captivity in Corto Maltese, Harley was able to take out multiple soldiers unarmed and did not suffer any injuries.
Stick mastery: Harley is dangerously skilled with bludgeoning weapons like her mallet and baseball bat. Most notably, she used her baseball bat to take down multiple Eyes of the Adversary and even landed a hit on the Enchantress, though it failed to faze her. When escaping a gang of bounty hunters, she was able to take down a number of them using a baseball bat found in evidence. Later, while fighting Black Mask's criminal organization, Harley utilized a mallet to take many of them down. Harley was also able to effectively utilize her Fun Gun in much the same way as her baseball bat, using it to block blows and using it as a blunt weapon. In Corto Maltese, she used Gunter Braun's javelin with great efficiency when killing guards.
Knife proficiency: Harley is skilled at using knives. Using a karambit against Batman while underwater, attempted to use a razor against guards, and even using a tranquilizer dart to repeatedly stab Victor Zasz. She is also a skilled knife-thrower, based on the knives in the target shaped like Joker's face.

Master acrobat:     Harley flips onto the roof of a moving car   Harley Quinn, as a former gymnast, is shown to be highly skilled in various acrobatics, including pole dancing and other agile maneuvers, often incorporating agile moves while fighting opponents, notably able to flip over one monstrous Eye of the Adversary when it managed to get a hold of her, thus twisting herself out of his grasp, and to easily dodge slashes from Enchantress' daggers. After falling out of Joker's helicopter, she broke her fall and effortlessly rolled it off. When raiding the GCPD, she was able to evade attacks from the police officers and other prisoners using a variety of cartwheels and handsprings, as when Renee Montoya had Harley at gunpoint and Harley was able to flip kick the phone she was holding into her face knocking her unconscious. When being tailed by Black Mask she was able to perform a back handspring onto the top of his vehicle to avoid being run down. Harley's athleticism paid off in dividends during her brief career in roller derby. Her background in gymnastics allowed her to easily wield Gunter Braun's javelin as a pole vault in combat.

Expert marksman: Harley Quinn, while not nearly on par with Deadshot or Bloodsport, is nonetheless a highly skilled markswoman, landing several headshots on some of Enchantress' monstrous Eyes of the Adversary troops, even while performing acrobatic maneuvers. When raiding the GCPD, she was able to shoot several officers in their center mass, as well as some in the face and even one from behind with her Fun Gun. She used Renee Montoya's revolver to shoot a statue (which she believed to be Black Mask) in the head. In Corto Maltese, she killed the dictator Silvio Luna with a single round from an antique revolver, and shot her way out of the building in which she was kept prisoner, first using a single pistol, then dual-wielding a pair of pistols and lastly firing two rifles akimbo-style. She also used a rocket launcher on the beach.
Gifted intellect: Harley Quinn is exceptionally intelligent, having been an excellent academic achiever in high school, which earned her a full scholarship to the prestigious Gotham State University, where she would go on to write a very successful graduate thesis. Harley's intellect extends itself to her psychological, tactical and deception skills.
Master psychiatrist:      Harley Quinn as Doctor Harleen Quinzel   Harley Quinn, while still Harleen Quinzel, was an extremely skilled psychologist, majoring in psychiatry at Gotham State University, with her psychology graduate thesis being a huge success, and allowing her the opportunity to work as a psychologist at the infamous Arkham Asylum itself. Even after being rendered psychopathic by the Joker, Harley shows at least traces of her psychologist expertise, being able to make swift breakdowns of the psychological profiles of El Diablo, Killer Croc, and Katana, knowing exactly what to say in order to get under their skin (theorizing El Diablo had a guilty conscience because of all the killing he had done and later criticizing him for ever thinking he could have a normal life with his powers and for not taking responsibility for the death of his children, judging Killer Croc's exterior aesthetic in addition to his interior and intuiting his need to eat people combined with his hatred for mankind and viewing the world as a sewer, diagnosing Katana with deep-seated father issues, and knew what Captain Boomerang was thinking, even while couching his words and proceeded to taunt him). Hence, she even proudly proclaims to Rick Flag that she is known to be "quite vexing," and later diagnosed Deadshot as "another textbook sociopath" as her certified professional opinion. After her emancipation, she pointed out Black Mask as having a delicate sense of mental equilibrium (which she agitates) and an obsessive-compulsive need to be the center of attention, and understood that he built a criminal empire in a "very misguided" attempt to win back the respect of his father after the latter kicked him out of Janus Corp. She later noted Huntress for her childhood trauma and spoke to her on the topic of revenge, stating that it rarely brings the catharsis that one desires. The Joker referred to her as "Dr. Harleen Quinzel, eminent psychiatrist to the outrageous and crazy."
Expert tactician: Harley Quinn, while not quite on par in this regard with her ex-boyfriend Joker, is nonetheless highly skilled with improvising criminal activities, managing to trap and murder Batman's protegé Robin when she was still an adolescent (though she notably had the assistance of Joker in this), to suggest a feasible escape option to Deadshot and Captain Boomerang, and to swiftly improvise a plan to weaken and take down the fearsome and powerful Enchantress in her adulthood. Following her emancipation, she single-handedly destroyed Ace Chemicals (while intoxicated) and she later had Black Mask meet her in familiar territory to hand over Cassandra Cain, knowing she would have weapons in the facility in case the deal went awry. During the Battle of Valle Del Mar, she was perceptive as she realized what Starro's weak spot was and protected both King Shark and Polka-Dot Man from certain death during Jotunheim's collapse by anticipating attacks to come from enemies.
Expert deceiver: Harley Quinn is a highly skilled deceiver, thus when Deadshot pretended to shoot at her, she convincingly pretended to have been killed only to reveal that she is still alive and later on, managing to trick Enchantress into thinking that she was about to swear allegiance to the latter, and to subsequently use that distraction to suddenly cut open Enchantress's chest with Katana's sword, exposing and pulling out the supervillain's vulnerable heart. Her proficiency in lying allowed her to recognize Cassandra Cain's own lies regarding the whereabouts of the Bertinelli diamond, pointing out the inflection in her voice and the way she could not maintain eye contact.
Master escapologist:     Harley escapes Renee Montoya's handcuffs   During her time in Belle Reve, Harley was kept in an electrified cage surrounded by a barbed wire fence, implying she was an expert at escaping normal prison cells. During her skirmish with Renee Montoya, Quinn was able to uncuff herself from Montoya and handcuff Montoya with the former only realizing afterwards. While captured and being tortured, Harley escaped by strangling her guard wither her legs and used her feet to unlock her shackles.
Skilled detective: Harley once recovered a rare photograph of a nude Eleanor Roosevelt lost by the Joker, finding it in a bird's nest in Robinson Park.

Harley fearlessly feeding a hyena
Pathological indomitable will: Harley Quinn (much like the Joker) possesses an obliviousness to danger that makes her invulnerable to fear and intimidation, which are usually Batman's greatest weapons in combat. Unlike Joker, however, Harley does seem to fear death, as she was dismayed by the Smiley Car crashing into a river, due to her inability to swim and was distressed when Black Mask threatened to kill her during his interrogation.
Weaknesses
Mental illness: Harley Quinn's great weakness is that her insanity occasionally impairs her higher thinking, which is understandably more evident after her breakup with Joker. However, she usually makes up for this with her tactical, strategic, and escapology skills.
Equipment
Weapons
Harley Quinn aiming her revolver
Chiappa Rhino 60DS: Harley sports a customized Chiappa Rhino 60DS, 6 cylinder magnum revolver that she carries in a black leather holster slung under her arm. Harley used it to take down many of Enchantress' monstrous Eyes of the Adversary goons, and briefly lent it to Deadshot, so that he could destroy the mystical superweapon. Each cylinder has Love or Hate engraved into them.
Good Night: Harley carries a personalized wooden baseball bat with "Good Night" written down the side of it that she used for close-quarters combat, notably taking down numerous Eyes of the Adversary with it during her assignment in Midway City. This weapon would then be used by Black Canary in their final encounter with Black Mask's criminal organization.
Baseball bat: Harley used a baseball bat found in police storage while fighting off bounty hunters who sought to claim the bounty on Cassandra Cain.
Harley Quinn's mallet: Harley carried a personalized wooden mallet that she used during her villainous escapades with her boyfriend the Joker. When the squad was given their old equipment, she almost brought the mallet to Midway City with her but chose to bring her baseball bat instead. She later used this Mallet against Black Mask's henchmen.
Karambit knife: Harley carried a knife that she tried to use to attack Batman when he saved her from drowning within the submerged Smiley Car.
Fun Gun: Harley used a M79 grenade launcher with homemade non-lethal ammo to break Cassandra Cain out of jail, even using the grenade launcher itself as an improvised melee weapon.
Smith & Wesson Model 38 "Bodyguard": Rene gave Harley her snub-nosed revolver, which only had one bullet left. She later used it in an attempt to shoot Black Mask but hit a statue instead.
Javelin's Javelin: Before Javelin dies, he gives Harley his javelin, telling her she is the best fit to carry it.
Bazooka: In Harley's bag, she seems to have a bazooka inside of it, throughout the entire movie, she only uses it once, it works as any other bazooka it seems.
Other equipment
Harlequin costume: Harley originally wore a red and black diamond-patterned costume after joining the Joker, completed by a cap with two white balls on the ends. She later ditched the costume in favor of more provocative clothing, instead opting to wear a red and blue bomber jacket with matching short shorts, fishnet stockings, and heeled boots.
Harley's toy beaver: Harley carries a taxidermied beaver with added accessories wherever she goes.
Former equipment
Nano-bomb implant: Harley Quinn had a nano-bomb implanted in her neck while operating under Amanda Waller. As a result, if she attempted to flee during a mission, the implant would be triggered and explode, immediately killing her. However, the Joker later disabled the bomb, allowing Harley to escape later.
Cellphone: Harley was given a purple cellphone from the Joker's phone by Captain Griggs, allowing them to communicate while she was under Amanda Waller's control.
Roller skates: Harley used a pair of roller skates during the siege at the Booby Trap, and later used them during her pursuit of Black Mask.
Bertinelli diamond: A valuable diamond that was the key to unlocking the fortune of the Bertinelli crime family. After the Birds of Prey unlocked the fortune to fund their organization, they gave it to Harley and Cassandra Cain and they sold it at a pawn shop to get money to further their own affairs.
Former vehicles
Smiley Car: Harley and the Joker used the vehicle to go on a date night. However, after Batman intervened and attempted to stop them, it was crashed into a river and destroyed.
Helicopter: While heading for her mission with the rest of Task Force X, Harley was transported in a helicopter.

Trivia
Harley implies that she may have schizophrenia, as she claims to hear voices; she also implies that she hallucinates to as she mentions being "off her meds" upon seeing the Enchantress's magical superweapon. Granted, despite her clear mental instability, the sarcastic way she phrases both imply she's joking.
In promoting the film, this version of Harley Quinn was added to the mobile version of DC's video game Injustice: Gods Among Us. She, alongside the Joker, was added alongside Deadshot to the game, while members of Suicide Squad were also added as "gear cards."
According to her mug shot, she was caught by Batman on October 13, 2014.
According to Zack Snyder, the death of Robin takes place 10 years before the events of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which takes place in 2015, placing Dick's death in 2005. In Suicide Squad, it is revealed that Harley was involved with Robin's murder. However, Harley was born in 1990, which would have made her 15 at the time of Robin's murder.
David Ayer later revealed that Harley being implicated in Robin's death was added by the Trailer Park, and not his original intent for the character.

In the animated prologue of Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn), it was confirmed that Harley is either bisexual or pansexual, and has always been such; she dated two men and one woman before she became Joker's girlfriend.
According to Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn, she voted Bernie Sanders in the 2016 (and most likely 2020) democratic primary election.
According to David Ayer's original script, Harley Quinn and Deadshot were supposed to end up in a relationship.
Harley is one of the DCEU characters who appears as a player skin in Fortnite. Her two skin appearances are based on her looks in Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey.
Harley's costume in The Suicide Squad is based on her outfit in the Batman: Arkham video games, with the jacket having been based on biker culture.
Behind the scenes
Originally Harley Quinn made her first debut in Batman: The Animated Series as part of the DC Animated Universe in 1992. Due to the popularity of her character, she was adapted into the DC Comics universe in 1999.
This is Harley's first incarnation in a movie adaptation, while it is her third live-action appearance. She played the role of the main antagonist in the TV series Birds of Prey as played by Mia Sara, and her second brief appearance was in the TV series Arrow. However, her first planned live-action appearance was planned to be in the canceled fifth Batman: The Motion Picture Anthology film, Batman Unchained.
According to Andrew Kreisberg, Harley Quinn was planned to appear in more episodes of Arrow, but Willa Holland stated that the idea was dropped because of the introduction of Quinn in the DC Extended Universe. She appears in the Arrow episode, "Suicide Squad" and in a deleted scene of "Unthinkable."

She appears in the Arrow episode, "Suicide Squad" and in a deleted scene of "Unthinkable."
According to Margot Robbie, she received each of the suits that Harley Quinn has worn in all her appearances in DC Comics media during the production of the movie, such as the suit of Batman: The Animated Series, or the suit of the Batman: Arkham video game franchise.
David Ayer had Margot Robbie in mind for the role of Harley Quinn. However, Emma Roberts was offered the role by Warner Bros, but she turned it down. Olivia Thirlby, Imogen Poots, Alison Brie, Rooney Mara, Olivia Wilde, Emma Watson, Emily Browning, Zooey Deschanel, Lily Collins, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Sara Paxton, Amanda Seyfried, and Evan Rachel Wood were also considered for the role of Harley Quinn.
According to Zack Snyder, he initially planned to shoot Harley Quinn's death scene during the Knightmare era for his planned sequels to Justice League. Since his involvement in any possible sequels became unlikely, Zack chose to reference her scene in the dialogue between Batman and Joker in Zack Snyder's Justice League.
Regarding her character, Margot Robbie stated that "It's hard to find a character who gives you as many options as an actor" and that "She can be vulnerable. She can be making terrible decisions...but she's very smart."
The writing on the back of Harley's jacket in The Suicide Squad reads "Live Fast Die Clown", but director James Gunn made three jackets for her with different inscriptions, with the other two reading "Clown AF" and "World's Best Grandpa".
Ingrid Kleinig, Margot Robbie, Melissa R. Stubbs, Renae Moneymaker and Michelle Steilen were stunt doubles for Margot Robbie in the role of Harley Quinn.
