Biography
Early life
Waylon Jones was born on June 3, 1968, in Tampa, Florida. His mother died in childbirth, and because his father left him to be raised by his aunt, he suffered emotional abuse since her persistent drinking prevented him from growing up in an ideal household. Living in Chokoloskee, Florida, at age eight, Waylon was diagnosed with all 28 known types ichthyosis skin disorders, causing him to start breaking out in crocodile skin-like rashes. The rashes continued to grow over the years, until they engulfed his entire body. When he hit puberty he started to develop enhanced strength and durability.

He joined a traveling carnival where he became an experienced crocodile wrestler known for his cannibalistic tendencies, earning himself the name "Killer Croc". By that time, his body changed to make him increasingly animal-like, as well as developing a highly durable hide and regenerative powers.

Realizing that there was more money to be made through crime, Croc soon decided to find himself a home in Gotham City, New Jersey. Upon arrival, he served as an enforcer for the mob, but took it upon himself to target other criminals and become the city's most powerful figure. At some point during his criminal career, Croc hired the assassin named Deadshot to perform a particular gruesome assassination on several targets he desired. This included tearing the heart out of one of the male victims. At another point in time, he was known to have murdered the individuals Joseph and Trina Todd, an action which led to their adopted son Jason to fight crime under the mantle of the "second Robin".

Eventually, he came into conflict with the vigilante Batman, who defeated and chased him out of Gotham. Croc tried searching for sanctuary elsewhere, but was eventually captured by an ARGUS SWAT team in his sewer hideout and sentenced to life imprisonment at Belle Reve, where was treated like an animal and kept locked in an underground cage at his request. There, the guards fed him raw animal meat, but he would often attack them until he was either tazed or tranquilized if they were unfortunate to enter his cage.[citation needed]

Saving the world
Recruited into Task Force X
Killer Croc in jail
Months after Croc was apprehended, Amanda Waller gathered skilled individuals and metahumans for Project Task Force X. Upon their visit to Belle Reve to examine the future team, she had Rick Flag visit Croc outside his cell while the monster is doing push ups. Croc had sensed his presence and slowly approaches Flag, asking why he isn't scared of him. Flag avoids answering the question and asks Croc why he is imprisoned in an underground cage. Croc tells Flag that it was because he asked to be, then quickly ended the conversation.

Facing Enchantress and Incubus
Croc was later forced into the Task Force X, to take care of the situation in Midway City. He played the part of brute force in the team, rarely ever speaking. When the group decided to have drinks, Croc took offense to Harley calling him ugly both in appearance and personality; Croc told her that his personality was different.

Killer Croc and Katana at the aftermath of the battle
When it came time for the final battle, Croc helped fight off monsters underwater, allowing Flag's men to detonate a bomb that killed Incubus and El Diablo, but were all killed by either the monsters or the bomb. Croc, however, barely managed to survive with only a few burns. He later on joined his teammates in the battle against Enchantress. Once Enchantress was killed, Croc planned to head back to the Gotham sewers. However, Waller was revealed to be alive and ready to blow their heads off. When she asked if anyone else in the squad would like a perk back at prison, Croc asked for the BET channel.

Return in prison
He was later seen lounging on a couch in his cell, enjoying a hamburger and music on his new TV.

Personality
Waylon Jones grew up with a very dysfunctional childhood due to his appearance, getting into fights with his peers for making fun of his grotesque appearance. That, in addition to years of abuse from his alcoholic aunt have turned him into a rather cold individual and the taunting of children and others only exacerbated it. This caused Waylon to despise humanity and gain a horribly negative outlook on life as well adopt many neo-tribalistic beliefs.

Croc is incredibly, violent, hostile and dangerous, to the point where it is a mere risk going near him. He acts in an animalistic manner, and shown to often distrust others, given his hatred of humanity. Indeed, he is a cold-blooded cannibalistic murderer who will not hesitate to rip apart or devour those he dislikes, or due his neo-tribalistic mindset, which he believes that eating his victims gives him their power, which is similar to how African warriors believe after they defeat their enemies.

Croc is, however, capable of feeling joy, as shown when he is watching television in his cell and enjoying music and he seems to care about his fellow Task Force X teammates to at least some extent, notably using his strength to hurl Enchantress away from them.

Powers and abilities
Powers
Crocodilian physiology: Standing 6'5" and weighing 360 pounds, Killer Croc has skin comparable to that of a reptile. His durable skin and inhumanly large musculature, combined with his reptilian genetics and traits grant him multiple metahuman abilities. Crocodiles themselves are apex predators that lived through the K-T extinction and remained physically unchanged for 100 million years, weighing at a half-ton with a bite force of 20K newtons and stomach acid intense enough to dissolve bones. He stayed in shape by working out in his prison cell, mainly through pushups.

Superhuman strength: Killer Croc has a degree of superhuman strength, due to him being inhumanly bulky and muscular. He could potentially bench press a pickup truck. This easily makes him the physically strongest member of the Suicide Squad. Hence, he was able to become an experienced crocodile wrestler, able to easily overpower ARGUS agents, beat many monstrous Eyes of the Adversary troops to death with his bare hands, able to send the exceptionally fit Captain Boomerang flying several feet away from him with a mere swing of his arm, able to easily hurl Rick Flag's heavy bomb into the mystical superweapon, and able to temporarily rival the physical strength of Enchantress herself, hurling her away from the rest of his Suicide Squad teammates. He also dented a car by pushing Captain Boomerang into it, and threw a woman into a second-story window from half a block away.
Superhuman durability: Killer Croc is covered over with scaled skin so thick bullets would not even begin to pierce it. Hence, he is highly durable, to a much higher degree than that of a normal human, with his skin acting as natural body armor. However, multiple tasers used simultaneously are able to knock Killer Croc out, allowing an ARGUS SWAT team to bring him down at last.
Regenerative healing factor: Killer Croc was able to recover rather quickly from the blows of Incubus and Enchantress.
Regenerative healing factor: Killer Croc was able to recover rather quickly from the blows of Incubus and Enchantress.
Superhuman stamina: Killer Croc did 943 pushups in his cell, and he was good for a few hundred more.
Enhanced senses: Killer Croc's reptilian physiology grants him acute senses, especially his sense of smell and hearing. He could sense Rick Flag approaching his cell from behind.
Enhanced vision: Killer Croc also displayed shining eyes while in his prison cell, similar to Aquaman's, indicating that he can see in locations with very low levels of light.

Longevity: While unclear exactly how vast, Killer Croc possess a longer lifespan than humans, as despite being chronologically 50 years old, he is apparently still in his physical prime.
Fang protrusion: Killer Croc has razor-sharp teeth. He chewed off Gerry Moench's hand.
Abilities
Skilled combatant: While he was no match for Batman, Killer Croc is a highly effective physical combatant, stemming from his  fights with his peers during his youth, managed to become an experienced crocodile wrestler, to serve as an enforcer for the mob, to defeat and beat many monstrous Eyes of the Adversary troops to death with his bare hands, and managing to hurl Enchantress herself away from his teammates, though she was notably caught off-guard.
Killer Croc quickly swims underground
Expert swimmer: Killer Croc, due to having lead a reptilian life for years (notably living in Gotham City's sewers for a time), is an extremely skilled swimmer and can stay under water for vast periods of time, thus swiftly helping Rick Flag's Navy SEAL team plant a bomb under Incubus.

Behind the scenes
Killer Croc is the only member of Task Force X that was never on the team in DC Comics. However, thanks to Suicide Squad’s popularity, he became a member in the 2016 Suicide Squad series.
This version of Killer Croc is inspired by the physics of his first appearances in DC Comics.
Originally, King Shark was to appear as a member of Task Force X, but David Ayer did not feel comfortable adding a fully CG character in the Squad, so Killer Croc replaced King Shark.
Trivia
According to his criminal record, Killer Croc's skin condition requires a humid environment. This would explain the reason behind Croc's cell having a pool of water.
According to his criminal record he was born in 1968, however in Secret Files of the Suicide Squad he's stated to be eight years old in 1996, which is 20 years younger.
Killer Croc laughs when Captain Boomerang asks if El Diablo's tattoos come off, likely happy that someone else's appearance is being jeered at for once.
Killer Croc claims to admire Amanda Waller's ruthlessness.
