Princess Diana of Themyscira is an Amazon warrior princess and one of the world's first superheroes, known as Wonder Woman. She is the daughter of Queen Hippolyta and Zeus, the king of the Old Gods, as well as a member and co-founder of the Justice League. 

Born on Themyscira, Diana was raised in a land of paradise, hearing tales of the Amazonsâ€™ great task of defeating the corrupt God of War, Ares, ushering in a new era of peace to the world. Upon coming of age, Diana began pursuing the life of a warrior, despite her mother's objections. Determined to serve, she ultimately enticed her aunt Antiope to train her in secret. This, however, was soon discovered by her mother. Begrudgingly, the queen accepted Diana as a warrior, and ordered Antiope to train her better than any other Amazon.

Following a training session, Diana happened to come across Captain Steve Trevor during his escape from the Imperial German Army in the ongoing Great War. A battle soon followed, as the Germans tracked Trevor to Themyscira, where they invaded in pursuit of Doctor Poison's notes. The loss of Antiope and subsequent realization of mankind's downfall during the absence of the Amazons convinced Diana to join the war effort, recognizing Ares as the instigator of the conflict. In the following days, Diana soon uncovered Ares, who exposed her to be the God Killer, having been originally conceived to be the ultimate weapon against her brother. Following this revelation, a fierce battle ensued, where Diana fulfilled her purpose in freeing mankind from Ares' influence. 

The loss of Steve in World War I and the loss of her other friends sometime after 1918 had left Diana broken-hearted & isolated but she vowed to protect humanity whenever she was needed due to her very compassionate nature over the years after 1918 in the shadows as a mysterious female savior which people are curious about on who she is. She also gained more knowledge on the world plus she changed residence over the years to keep herself guarded while landing jobs at museums like the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.

In 1984, she came into conflict with entrepreneur Maxwell Lord and former friend Barbara Minerva all while reuniting with Steve to prevent a possible nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union after Lord used the Dreamstone for his own means which caused global chaos and instability in the process. She successfully did so after she convinced Lord and the people of the world to renounce their wishes to undo the chaos that was created. 

In modern times, Diana operates as the curator of the Louvre Museum as Diana Prince. Two years following the Black Zero Event, Diana came into conflict with billionaire supergenius Lex Luthor, who discovered a photograph of Diana and the Wonder Men during his search for metahumans. During her pursuit of Luthor, Diana crossed paths with Bruce Wayne, who discovered her secret after their confrontation during his search for the White Portuguese. Later, along with the photograph on Luthor's files Bruce sent her, Diana discovered the evidence of metahumans in the world. With her mission fulfilled, Diana prepared to depart back to London, but the emergence of the monstrous Doomsday led Diana to ally herself with Superman and Batman to take down the monster in a fierce battle that ended with the tragic death of Superman. Afterwards, in the wake of Clark's funeral, Diana and Bruce decided to create a team to battle any future threats to the world. 

As the world mourned for the Man of Steel, Diana combatted the rise of radicals who saw Superman's death as an omen and capitalized on the world's vulnerability. Shortly after the team assembled, Wonder Woman assisted in helping a newly resurrected Superman regain his memories. With the team now fully assembled, Wonder Woman contributed to the successful offensive against Steppenwolf, forcing the alien invasion into retreat. Afterwards, she began to plan for the Justice League's future alongside Bruce Wayne.

Biography
Childhood
Young Diana admiring the God Killer sword
Diana was born circa 3000 BC on the newly-created island of Themyscira, to Zeus, the King of the Old Gods, and Hippolyta, the Queen of the Amazons, mere months after the end of War of the Gods. Zeus intended for the child to one day grow strong enough to defeat Ares, the God of War. Fearful for her daughter's safety, Hippolyta lied to Diana about her true parentage, instead telling Diana that she'd sculpted her from clay and prayed to Zeus to bring her to life. Diana would believe this story for most of her life.

As the only child on the island, Diana grew bored by her lessons. She began to take an active interest in the Amazons' combat training, despite her mother's stern refusal of it. She often ran off from her tutors to watch the Amazons train.

Her aunt Antiope, General of the Amazons, was aware the true nature of Diana's background. Knowing that one day she would have to face Ares, and caring so deeply for her well-being, she began to train the young princess in secret.

Training
Diana training with Antiope
Seven years after her training had begun, their deceit was discovered by Hippolyta. Angry at Antiope for defying her decision, Hippolyta sent Diana back to her room so that she could speak to her sister alone. Antiope reasoned with the Queen, reminding her that Ares was alive and would come for Diana someday. 

Hippolyta accepted this with some difficulty, and ordered Antiope to train Diana harder than any Amazon before her, until she was better than even Antiope herself, the Amazons' fiercest warrior. Thus, with the blessing of her mother, Diana formally began extensive training in all forms of Amazon combat. Over the years, she became a formidable warrior.

Diana during the early stages of the competition
Eventually, Diana competed in multi-stage athletic competition against fully grown Amazonian competitors. After falling from her horse due to looking back at her opponents and taking a shortcut, she was disqualified, which she was forced to account for when an unnamed contestant snatched her stave unexpectedly. As Hippolyta observed, Antiope lectured the little girl on the importance of truth and assured her there was no shame in losing to larger and more experienced competitors.

Diana accidentally striking Antiope in front of several sparrers
Much later, during a training session observed by Hippolyta, Diana sparred against her fellow warriors, demonstrating her weapons expertise and defeating each of them swiftly. Her final opponent was Antiope herself. The two fought with all their might. Diana managed to disarm Antiope and looked toward her mother for approval. Antiope seized the opportunity to push Diana to the ground and pick up her sword, admonishing her for letting her guard down. As Antiope slashed at her and forced her backwards, Diana instinctively brought her arms together to block the attack. She clashed her arm gauntlets together, resulting in her unleashing a powerful shock-wave that sent Antiope flying back and left all spectating Amazons there, including Diana herself, in complete shock.

World War I
Themysciran beach battle
Diana rescues and meets Steve Trevor for the first time
A shocked Diana apologized to Antiope and abruptly left the training session. She wandered off to a cliff on the Themysciran seashore and examined her gauntlets in awe. As she stood there, she noticed an airplane burst through the forcefield surrounding Themyscira and crash in the nearby waters. Seeing even from a great distance away that someone was trapped inside the sinking aircraft, she leaped down the ocean and rescued the pilot, none other than a human soldier named Steve Trevor. She pulled him out of the water and onto the Themysciran shore. As he came to, she noted in disbelief that he was a man, as she had never seen one before. Though somewhat confused, Steve affirmed that he was, rhetorically asking whether or not he looked like one.

She asked him who he was, but before he could answer, the two noticed several boats coming through the island's forcefield. Steve noted that he was one of the good guys and the people on the boatsâ€”Germansâ€”were bad guys. Having noticed the invading ships, the Amazons quickly gathered on the cliffs above the beach. Hippolyta ordered Trevor to move away from Diana, but forgot about him as the German soldiers began to come closer to shore. She took command of her army, ordering the archers to fire on the boats. Diana and Trevor took cover behind boulders on the beach.

As the soldiers landed on the shore and began to open fire, several archers leaped from the cliffs. Diana watched, horrified, as a bullet fired from one of the German soldiers hit an archer, killing her almost instantly. Amazon cavalry stormed the beach, engaging the soldiers and quickly overwhelming them. Though Trevor told her to stay back as he fought one of the German soldiers, Diana picked up a sword from a fallen Amazon and easily dispatched a soldier.

Diana joining the battle
As the battle came to an end, a soldier aimed his gun at Diana while her back was turned. Unable to warn Diana in time, Antiope leaped in front of her, taking the bullet and saving her life. As she lay dying, Antiope urged Diana to use the God Killer and defeat Ares.

Diana before stealing the Amazon battle armor
Hippolyta, in angry grief over her sister's death, attempted to kill Trevor for bringing the Germans to Themyscira. Diana stopped her in time, telling her that he had fought by her side. As the Amazons debated whether to kill him or not, Artemis argued that they needed to question him as to who the Germans were and why they'd come.

Diana and the Amazons questioning Steve Trevor
Trevor was taken to be interrogated using the Lasso of Hestia. Though he tried to resist the lasso's power at first, unwilling to reveal military secrets, he nonetheless was powerless to withstand it and admitted that he was a spy. He told them that he'd been on a mission to observe General Ludendorff and Doctor Poison, that he'd stolen the latter's research notebook, and that his escape had brought himself and the Germans to Themyscira. He described the Great War, informing them that millions of people had died. Hearing this, Diana deduced that only Ares could be behind a war of that magnitude. She tried to persuade Hippolyta to send the Amazons back with him to face the god, but her mother refused, much to Diana's confusion.

Diana grabbing the God Killer sword
Later, as a healer tended to Diana's battle wounds, she noted with confusion that Diana's wounds had healed completely. Diana then visited Trevor in his cell, asking him about the outside world. Due to his words, Diana decided to sneak him off the island and confront Ares herself. She snuck into the island's tower and stole the God Killer, along with an Amazon shield, the Lasso of Hestia, and a special set of battle armor. She broke Trevor out of his cell and took him to the island's dock, where she was intercepted by her mother. To her surprise, Hippolyta allowed Diana to leave, gifting her Antiope's tiara. She then warned Diana to be careful, mournfully telling her that the world of men did not deserve her.

She and Trevor cast the boat off into the ocean, and Diana watched as her home vanished as they passed through the island's forcefield. As they sailed, Diana told Trevor about Ares and the Amazons' mission to kill him. They then lay down for the night and discussed the concept of marriage, which Diana found odd.

Experiencing London
Diana and Steve Trevor arriving in London
The next day, Diana awoke to find that they had hitched a ride on a larger ship and arrived in London. She was less than pleased at the sight of the city, stating that it was hideous.
As they walked through the streets of London, Diana insisted that Trevor take her to the war. She was dismayed to hear that he intended to deliver Doctor Poison's notebook to his superiors in the British War Council. Trevor promised that if he went with her to deliver the notebook, he would take her to the war. Though annoyed by the detour, Diana agreed. Trevor then realized that she was only wearing her battle armor, and took her to a store to buy her some clothes. As they walked to the store, Diana was delighted to see a baby and ran toward it, with Trevor having to pull her away.

At the store, the two met up with Etta Candy, Trevor's secretary. Candy was overjoyed to see Trevor alive and well. She introduced herself to Diana and offered her hand to shake, but Diana, unaware of what the gesture meant, simply asked what a secretary was. Upon hearing Candy's answer, Diana noted that the job sounded similar to slavery.

Diana and Etta Candy shopping for an outfit
Candy helped Diana try on a great many outfits until she finally settled on one. Dissatisfied, thinking that she still looked too "distracting," Trevor gave her a pair of spectacles to wear. After they had paid and left the store, Diana reluctantly allowed Candy to take her sword and shield back to Trevor's office while the two took Doctor Poison's notebook to the British War Council.

Diana saving Steve from a bullet
As they walked, Trevor noticed that they were being followed. He tried to lose them by taking a turn down a back alley, but instead walked straight into a German spy's gun. The man ordered Trevor to give the notebook back; he refused, instead headbutting the man. He told Diana to stay back at the man took aim and shot at them. Diana reached out her arm, blocking the bullet off her gauntlet and saving Trevor's life. Diana then fought the German spies single-handedly; her spectacles were crushed in the fight.

As one of the spies tried to make his escape, Candy blocked his exit, brandishing the God Killer. Diana used her lasso to trap the man and ask him where Ares was. Rather than reveal any information, the spy committed suicide by swallowing a cyanide pill.

British War Council
Diana and Trevor arrived at the British War Council's meeting place. Trevor told her to stay behind while he retrieved one of his superiors from the war room. Curious, she followed him into the room, where dozens of men argued with each other while Sir Patrick Morgan struggled to be heard. The room fell silent as the men noticed Diana, as women were not allowed in the room; Trevor quickly escorted her out.

After the meeting, Trevor's superior berated him for taking a woman into the war room. Morgan then introduced himself to Diana. She began to introduce herself as "Diana, Princess of Themyscira," but Trevor cut her off to maintain her secret identity, calling her "Diana Prince." Trevor then informed Morgan that he had managed to steal Doctor Poison's notebook.

Diana meets Steve Trevor's superiors
The British War Council quickly gathered to discuss the notebook. Their codebreakers were unable to decipher the two different languages that it was written in, but Diana quickly identified them as Ottoman and Sumerian. She read the book out loud, informing the council that Doctor Poison had created a new form of mustard gas based on hydrogen instead of sulfur, which gas masks would be useless against.

Trevor pitched a mission to destroy the facility where the gas was being created, but his superiors decided against it, stating that it was too late in the war to do something as drastic as that. When Trevor argued that more soldiers would die, his superiors simply stated that that was what soldiers did. With the battle of Themyscira and the death of her aunt so fresh in her mind, Diana was infuriated by the man's comments and berated him, calling him a coward and telling the rest of the council that they should be ashamed. Trevor escorted her out as she ranted, apologizing to the council on her behalf.

Outside the room, Diana confronted Trevor for not standing up to the council. Trevor then told her that they were going anyway, without the council's approval. Diana, distrustful of him for lying, did not believe him; he resorted to using the Lasso of Hestia on himself, revealing in the process that he believed it was a terrible idea and that they were going to die.

Gathering allies
Steve then took Diana to a local tavern to gather reinforcements in the form of his friends, a spy named Sameer and a sniper named Charlie. She was dismayed to see them, as she did not consider them capable fighters or even good men. Sameer was enamored by Diana upon seeing her, something she did not appreciate.

Diana meeting Sameer and Charlie
Diana, Trevor, Sameer, and Charlie sat at a table together as Trevor proposed his plan to them. Sameer and Charlie were willing to join them, if they were paid for the job. Trevor, however, had no money. The two refused the job. Sameer told Diana that all the payment he needed was a photograph of her; Diana countered that he wouldn't need one, as she was going with them. He and Charlie were baffled by her response.

Diana stops the gunman
As they talked, a drunken man who Charlie had gotten into a fight with earlier walked up to him, pointing a gun at his head. Before he could pull the trigger, Diana grabbed the gun from his hand and shoved him away, hurling across the room.

Candy then joined the group, with Morgan in tow. The group was initially nervous to see him, as their plan was going against the direct orders of the British War Council, but Morgan assured them that he was there to help. He told them that their actions were admirable and gave Trevor a large sum of money as payment for Sameer and Charlie's help.

Belgium
The next day, the group left for the train that would take them to the war front in Belgium. Diana tried ice cream for the first time at the train station, which she greatly enjoyed.

In Belgium, Trevor informed Diana that they were to meet with another friend of his, a smuggler known as Chief. She observed with distaste the company they were keeping, noting that they were liars, murderers, and smugglers.

As they left the train station, Diana began to notice a steady stream of wounded soldiers coming from battle. She was horrified by their injuries.
The group took a ride on a small ship that Trevor had arranged for. They walked through the rest of the day, eventually arriving to Chief's camp at night. Chief introduced himself to Diana as Napi.

That night, as the others slept around Chief's fire, Diana mistook the cannon fire as for strange thunder. Charlie was awoken by a nightmare. Diana tried to comfort him, but he pushed her away in and left the camp. Chief then told Diana that Charlie was haunted by the people he had killed as a marksman.

The Wonder Men
Diana on No Man's Land
The following day, they go to No Man's Land where Diana sees that the people living in the villages were suffering as well. After this, she decides to go into No Man's Land, changing into her armor and blocking the bullets with her bracelets and her shield with the assist of the Wonder Men, led by Steve Trevor.

Wonder Men is honored with a photograph
She fights off against a group of German soldiers in a warehouse meeting the rest of Steve Trevor's team fighting off more Germans that were invading the village. The citizens of that town see Diana as a hero. In honor of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor's team's bravery, a photograph was taken of her with Steve Trevor's team.

She then sees Steve on the phone with Sir Patrick Morgan, and suddenly decides that General Ludendorff is really Ares. Later on, Steve and Diana are seen dancing where they finally accept they have feelings for each other and they kiss, after which they proceed to spend the night together.

Infiltrating Ludendorff's gala
Diana during Ludendorff's gala
The next day, they decided to infiltrate Ludendorff's gala to learn more about the weapon he and Doctor Poison are creating and how to stop it. To enter the gala, Diana stole a dress from a guest where she dances with. She is prepared to kill Ludendorff, but her attempt is intervened by Steve. She hears Ludendorff release some of the gas where it kills citizens from that town.

Feeling devastated, Diana was distressed by this event blames Steve for interfering with her assassination attempt on Ludendorff thinking the people could have been saved with him already being dead, and realizes that Ares has corrupted everyone.

Infiltration of Ludendorff's base
Diana confronts Ludendorff
Diana stabbing Ludendorff
Receiving a signal from Chief, she infiltrates Ludendorff's base. She and General Ludendorff fight each other where Diana killed him. Thinking that killing Ludendorff would solve the problem, she gets confused when she sees the German soldiers loading the weapons onto the planes thinking that humankind is corrupted and it doesn't deserve her help.

Meeting Ares
Diana fights against Ares
Diana sees Sir Patrick Morgan in the base, who reveals himself to be the true Ares, and tells her of his plan for a world without humanity by having them destroy each other. Ares proposes that Diana help him accomplish his vision of paradise, but Diana promptly refuses, not wanting to kill billions of innocents. Ares then reluctantly engages her in an epic battle while Steve and his comrades attempt to dismantle the plane harboring the mustard gas.

During the fight, Steve approaches Diana who can't hear him speak due to an explosion temporarily rupturing her eardrums. Steve, after much talking, departs and leaves Diana with his watch before boarding the plane which is taking off with the mustard gas. Ares eventually restrains Diana, imploring her to surrender and realize the futility of their fight. Diana notices the plane in the sky as she's pinned to the ground and watches in horror as it explodes with Steve sacrificing himself to save billions of lives.

Diana unleashing her true power
Enraged, Diana breaks free and begins attacking the remaining German troops at the compound. Ares attempts to manipulate the distraught warrior by presenting her with Doctor Poison, saying she should kill her as she fittingly represents the worst of humanity and the evil it can possess as he predicted to Zeus and the other Old Gods.

Diana absorbs Ares' lightning
Diana lifts a tank ready to crush Doctor Poison with it, but hesitates when she thinks about the love and compassion that Steve brought to her life when she realizes that he professed his love for her before leaving to sacrifice himself. Dropping the tank, Diana spares Doctor Poison, telling Ares that he is wrong about humanity. She tells him that while humans are everything Ares says and can be capable of the worst crimes, she's learned that they are equally capable of so much more: unbridled love and compassion. Ares engages Diana in a final fight, but is defeated after she fully embraces her powers as the God Killer and blasts Ares with powerful divine lightning. The soldiers, free from Ares' corruption, stop their fighting, thereby finally ending the war.

Aftermath of the war
Diana seeing Steve's picture
Returning to London where the people are celebrating the end of the war, Diana notices a memorial with pictures of deceased soldiers who fought in the war with Steve being among them. Diana lovingly strokes Steve's picture before closing her eyes to take in the world being at peace once again.

A century of horrors
Living in Man's World
Despite helping win the war, defeating Ares and still loving humanity, Diana is still left sobered, emotionally broken, psychologically scarred, and devastated over not having been able to save the Belgian village from Dr. Poison, as well as over her beloved Steve Trevor's self-sacrificing death however she was inspired by his selfless act & love that shows her that humanity is worth believing & protecting despite their flaws so she vows to continues that however as a mysterious female savior since not interested in the fame

Wonder Woman later fought in World War II.


Although her exploits in helping humanity remained largely unrecorded, the resulting legend of 'Wonder Woman' persisted. At some point, a comic was made by the company All Star Comix that based it upon her known likeness.
Diana and Etta in front of the New York City skyline
After the death of all the other members of the Wonder Men, Diana and Etta Candy left London to live in the United States of America. Circa the 1950s, she and Etta traveled to New York City, where they took a photo together in front of the city skyline from out on the water. Etta died sometime before 1984.

Life in 1984
Diana and Barbara investigate the dreamstone
By 1984, Diana had become a senior anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C., specializing in the culture of ancient Mediterranean civilizations. One day, she met and befriended a new co-worker, Barbara Ann Minerva who had just slipped on her way in, dropping and scattering all her papers, Diana assisted her in picking up the mess. She was an insecure woman who idolized and envied Diana for her beauty and confidence. In the mix, aspiring businessman Max Lord visited the Smithsonian in search of a mysterious Dreamstone which seemingly granted wishes upon contact with any user.

Both Diana and Barbara unknowingly used the stone to fulfill their own desires. Diana wished for Steve Trevor to return into her life, causing his soul to take over another man's body.

Conflict with Maxwell Lord and Cheetah
Together, Diana, Steve, and Barbara tried to investigate the Dreamstone's power further and discover that it was created by Dolos - the god of treachery and mischief. The stone granted a user their wish but exacted a toll, much like in "The Monkey's Paw", and the only way to reverse the exchange was by renouncing the wish or destroying the stone itself. Steve realized that his existence came at the cost of Diana's powers, while Barbara's cost was her warmth and goodness. Both Diana and Barbara were unwilling to renounce their wishes and give up what they were given, and attempted to find alternative solutions.

Showdown
Meanwhile, aspiring businessman Max Lord came to personify the stone through his own wish, and subsequently became a powerful and influential figure, while leaving chaos and destruction in his wake. Upon learning from the U.S. President of a satellite broadcast system that could transmit signals globally, he chose to use it to grant wishes to the entire world. This would make him nearly invincible as he stole the things people cherished most. 

Diana was betrayed by Barbara when she revealed she had used her wish to become Diana's equal and joined forces with Maxwell to keep him safe from Diana herself. Diana confronted Maxwell in the White House where she was defeated by Barbara, and unable to use her power to heal or stop the terrible things Maxwell wanted to accomplish. More determined than ever, Steve convinced Diana to let go of him and renounce her wish. The process was emotionally painful for Diana who vowed to Steve that she would never love again, though he hoped that wasn't true. As she walked away she renounced her wish and regained her strength in the process, allowing her to take to the skies once more.

Returning home, she proceeded to don the armor of the legendary Amazon warrior Asteria and travel to the broadcast station. There, she fought against Barbara, who had made a second wish to become an apex predator, transforming her into Cheetah, a self-describing hybrid. The fight between the pair was brutal and caused the destruction of the armor's wings. Diana attempted to convince Cheetah to renounce her wish but she refused, not caring about the consequences of her actions due to her morality and humanity have been stripped away. Diana ultimately defeated Cheetah by restraining her underwater, but took pity on her as she simply wanted to be strong, not malevolent. Arriving to confront Maxwell, Diana used her Lasso of Truth to communicate with the world through him, convincing everyone to renounce their wishes, with remarkable success. With the wishes renounced, the world was restored to its former imperfection. Maxwell reunited with his son and the conflict ended for Diana.

Chance encounter
Having saved the world from destruction, Diana had finally accepted the truth that Steve is gone, having refused to pay the price anymore by not bringing him back, and was now continuing protecting the world whenever it was needed. Although she had returned to her isolated existence, she was happily observing the people to know what they are capable these days. In this current climate, Diana had a chance encounter at a fair, where she met the man whose body Steve had previously inhabited.

Subsequent Endeavors
At some point before the 21st century, Diana replaces her destroyed sword with the Sword of Athena, slays more sinister "beings from other worlds," & when not using the sword ,she continues performing heroic acts but remains incognito. Eventually she moves to France, and becomes a professional antiquities dealer, with the Louvre Museum employing her as the Curator for the Department of Antiquities.

At an orphanage in Gotham, 'Wonder Woman' had a fan in at least one girl who believed that she was a superior hero to both Batman and Superman.

Monitored by Lex Luthor
Diana in Paris
After examining the photo of Wonder Woman and the Wonder Men taken in 1918 Belgium, Lex Luthor uses facial recognition software to deduce that the great superheroic Amazon warrior is in fact still alive, under the alias of "Diana Prince," working at the Louvre Museum, and he obtains footage of Diana in Paris, France, which has her exiting a taxi and entering a shop, in civilian clothing.

Meeting Bruce Wayne
Diana listening to Luthor's speech.
Diana eventually became aware that Lex Luthor had in his possession the photograph of her and the Wonder Men, the only picture of her together with her deceased beloved even if she accepted the truth that he is gone.

Diana departs, with Bruce Wayne's device
Hence, in an effort to finally reclaim it and Steve's memory, Diana flew from France to the United States, and managed to get invited to a charity function hosted by Lex Luthor at his villa, an event which is also attended by Gotham City billionaire Bruce Wayne and illustrious Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent. During his greeting speech, Lex made a reference to how Zeus cruelly punished the Titan Prometheus for enlightening humankind, much to the visible dismay of Diana. Shortly thereafter, she covertly stole a hacking device of Bruce Wayne's, who is likewise investigating Lex Luthor. She exited the party with Bruce pursuing her, but manages to make it to her car and drive off just in time for Bruce to see her depart.

Diana is confronted by Bruce Wayne.
Later, Diana is seen in the Gotham City Museum of Antiquities (with ancient Greco-Roman exhibits), conversing with an elderly couple, when the curator comes up, and offers to show her something of interest. She politely excuses herself and follows him to the exhibit of the fake replica of Alexander the Great's sword, which the ancient conqueror of the Middle East had used to cut the Gordian knot.

While Diana stood admiring the replica, Bruce Wayne appeared. He proceeds to angrily confront her by grabbing Diana's arm and asking her about the information device that she had stolen. Bruce claims to see right through her "babe in the woods" act, saying that while Diana doesn't know him, he's met "a few women like [her]." Diana, however, calmly smiles and retorts that Bruce has never met any women like her. She then proceeds to tell Bruce that she was unable to obtain anything from Bruce's device, due to Lex Luthor's data having military-grade encryption. Diana explains her intention to re-obtain her photograph from Luthor, stating that she only borrowed Bruce's device, and has already returned it to him shortly beforehand (placing it into the glove compartment of his car), before calmly excusing herself and leaving.

Bruce Wayne discovers her Existence
Diana, observing the metahuman files with curiosity
Still puzzled as to Diana's identity, Bruce discovers more about her amongst the data he stole from Lex Luthor. He sees a photograph of her alongside the Wonder Men, taken in Belgium in 1918 during the closing days of World War I & asking the mysterious female savior of where sheâ€™s been. He then makes contact with her via her laptop, sharing extra information that Luthor had on both her and other metahumans, such as the Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg. Diana is visibly intrigued and shocked at this revelation, as Flash's lightning reminds her of that of Ares, Aquaman reminds her of depictions of Poseidon, while the Mother Box that created Cyborg reminds her of the one she briefly saw back on Themyscira. Diana needs to take some time to think this revelation over, does not answer Bruce's e-mail, and instead proceeds with her plans to depart Metropolis on a flight back to France, through Turkey.

The Death of Superman
Battle with Doomsday
Wonder Woman, Batman, and Superman, united against Doomsday
When news broke of Doomsday's attack on Metropolis, Diana was boarding an airplane bound for Turkey. Seeing what was happening, Diana reflects on what Steve said to her before that the world needs her so she is forced unto the big stage, left the flight before takeoff and dons her Wonder Woman armor and weapons before heading for Gotham City to help Batman and Superman in their battle against this incredibly powerful monstrous opponent.

Wonder Woman attacks Doomsday
As Wonder Woman joins the Battle against Doomsday, she arrives just in time to save Batman from Doomsday's lethal thermal blast, deflecting the beams with her indestructible bracelets. She then jointly attacks Doomsday with Superman while Batman tries to expose the creature to kryptonite, allowing its destruction. She relentlessly battles the monster, and despite Doomsday being stronger, Wonder Woman held her own, parrying a tremendous punch with the Sword of Athena, and then slicing off Doomsday's right arm with it. Eventually, Batman baits the monster into coming closer to her, allowing Wonder Woman to hurl the noose of her unbreakable Lasso of Hestia around his torso.

Superman then promptly flew back, wielding the kryptonite spear, and managed to impale the monster's chest. The mortally wounded Doomsday bellowed in agony, releasing immense amounts of electricity from his body, which made Wonder Woman momentary lose her footing, loosening the lasso's hold and allowing the monster to mortally stab Superman.

While a visibly shell-shocked and saddened Batman promptly retrieves Superman's lifeless body (enveloping him in his own cape), Wonder Woman takes the body from Batman, gently placing it on the ground before them. Lois proceeds to cradle and weep over her fallen beloved, as Wonder Woman and Batman stand next to her in respectful lamenting silence, with Wonder Woman empathically giving Lois a comforting glance, as she had been in the same position as Lois was with Steve before. Wonder Woman was astounded by Superman's selflessness, equaling that of Steve Trevor's own and was equally saddened at his death, due to now not having the chance to get to know Superman but inspired by him to come out of the shadows despite doing the good thing especially as a mysterious female savior while also understanding on what it means to be symbol despite not being one because sheâ€™s afraid of losing or hurting them since those important to her  .

Dawn of Justice
Diana and Bruce Wayne attend Clark Kent's funeral.

Diana attends Clark's funeral in Smallville along with Bruce, with the latter paying for it as an anonymous donor. The two share a conversation about honoring Superman by bringing together the three other metahumans, in case a worse threat to the world should ever arise. Diana inquires why Bruce is proposing it. He replies that it is simply due to a feeling he has that things will imminently get worse (in reality, he was following the instructions given to him by the  time-traveler.)

Considering Bruce's offer, Diana meanwhile returns to her job as Curator for the Department of Antiquities at the Louvre Museum. Bruce sends Diana a package, which contains the original, physical photograph of herself with the Wonder Men. She sends a thankful e-mail for bringing Steve back to her even if she accepted that heâ€™s gone awhile ago. Diana then dons her Wonder Woman armor after hearing a disturbance in the distance of Paris by sailing off the roof of the museum at sunset in Paris to confront it.

Coming together
Rescue at the Old Bailey Courthouse
Wonder Woman interrogates a terrorist
In London, a small group of reactionary terrorists took over the Old Bailey Courthouse, taking several hostages including a school field trip. Diana stormed the building and used the Lasso of Hestia to compel one of the terrorists to tell her their plans. He revealed that their leader had a bomb powerful enough to destroy several city blocks while the world media will watch. Diana took out the terrorists and neutralizes the bomb. The terrorist leader then tried to kill the hostages with a gun, but Diana protected the hostages by deflecting bullets with her bracelets, killing the leader.

Assembling the League

At the Louvre Museum, Diana watched a news report showing a signal fire burning at the Shrine of the Amazons and knew that it had been sent by her mother to warn of the impending invasion. Diana traveled to the shrine and discovered a painting of Darkseid's invasion of earth. Traveling to Gotham, she broke into Bruce's base of operations to find him tinkering with a new prototype troop carrier, the Flying Fox. It reminded her of someone she thinks of who would have loved to have flown it. Bruce tells her that he believes an invasion is imminent; she corrects him. It has already arrived.

While Bruce came back to Gotham and brought Barry Allen with the airplane, Diana awaited for their arrival. Bruce asked if she found Cyborg, to which her answer is that she and Stone spoke and told them to give him time.

Diana then introduced herself to Allen, as he mistakenly said the names wrong for his introduction. Just then, Allen pointed out the Bat Signal shining in the sky, meaning the Justice League should get going.

The Justice League receives intel from Commissioner James Gordon that the Parademons are traveling underground. Meanwhile, they go to find Steppenwolf interrogating the S.T.A.R. Labs employees about the final Mother Box.

But the Knightcrawler fails when Steppenwolf caught the missile and threw it against the wall, which then causes the harbor to flood which allows Steppenwolf to escape.

Before Diana could get hit with the flooding water, Aquaman comes and saves the team by using his trident to hold back the water while the League escaped.

Superman's resurrection
The team returns to the Batcave, and discusses a new plan. Victor explains that the mother boxes are "change machines", and they can bring things back to life. Bruce states they should use the Mother Box to bring Superman back to life believing that they need Superman to restore hope in humanity. Diana and Arthur are hesitant about the idea, but Bruce forms a secret contingency plan. The team put Clark's body in the waters of the Kryptonian ship, using Allen's Speed Force energy to activate the Box, causing the resurrection of Superman.

Wonder Woman witnesses the return of Superman
He flies out of the Kryptonian ship and lands in Heroes Park where Aquaman, Cyborg, Flash and Wonder Woman meet him. They notice that something is wrong with him, to which Clark uses his x-ray vision to scan the League before Cyborg accidentally launches a missile at him as his cybernetic body registers him as a threat. Superman attacks Cyborg with his heat vision as the rest of the Justice League try to subdue him, but he swiftly overpowers them.
