Alexander Joseph "Lex" Luthor, Jr. is a megalomaniacal multi-billionaire businessman, as well as one of the smartest individuals if not the smartest in the world by far. He is the former owner and CEO of LexCorp Industries.  

Lex Luthor also becomes the greatest arch nemesis of Superman, whose potential to cause the Knightmare and whose more or less very existence makes Lex feel extremely threatened, which makes the relentlessly ambitious supergenius go out of his way to expose the godlike alien superhero as a fraud, and to subsequently destroy him, by first pitting Superman against Batman in a duel to the death, which ultimately fails as neither Superman or Batman kill the other like Lex hoped by settling their differences, and then his monstrous creation Doomsday, which does manage to kill Superman after a vicious battle. 

Lex, however, is ultimately jailed as a supercriminal for his exposed numerous crimes of illegal natures, first in Belle Reve supermax, and then in Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.

Following the founding of the Justice League and defeat of Steppenwolf, Lex escaped captivity, acquired a private yacht, and met up with the assassin Deathstroke to discuss their tentative, forthcoming partnership, which involved Batman in some way.

Biography
Early life
Alexander Joseph "Lex" Luthor, Jr. was born in 1984, in Metropolis to Alexander Luthor, Sr., an East German-born billionaire petrochemical and heavy machinery developer, and was subsequently named after his father. While the family's company, LexCorp Industries, was in fact named after Lex's father, the elder Luthor claimed at investor pitches to have named it after his son as well, while Lex himself often mused at how wealthy old women found his father "[writing] checks for Lex" adorable.

While publicly popular and affable, Luthor Sr. was a very cruel and despicable man behind closed doors, with Lex later remarking in outrage that no "man in the sky" would ever come to save him from "[his father's] fists and abominations." This induced a traumatized Lex to gain a militantly misotheistic view of God, believing that if He were omnipotent, then it would be logically impossible for Him to be omnibenevolent and vice versa, thereby solidifying his belief that power cannot be innocent (referring to the antithesis of that as the "oldest lie in America"), and that all individuals with great power and popularity must be evil by definition.

CEO of LexCorp Industries
By age 16, the wunderkind Lex was left with the legacy of LexCorp as its only heir shortly after his father passed away unexpectedly, taking control of the business and successfully transformed it from a petrochemical and heavy machinery dinosaur into a cutting-edge Fortune 500 technology giant. In fact, the very considerable business achievements of his father pale in comparison to the astonishingly prolific accomplishments of the younger Luthor. Among other things, Lex also inherited his father's world-famous collection of meteorite crystals, which, as he would later learn, included kryptonite minerals.

Lex is known to have at one point encountered Amanda Waller and familiarized himself with her organization, ARGUS, and also learned of her Task Force X idea, as he subtly refers to all three while conversing with Ron Troupe.

Black Zero Event
During the chaos of the Black Zero event, Lex's company was known to have suffered several losses, including the destruction of Lexcorp Tower and at least one payload truck. According to Lex, during the events of the event, he and his assistant Mercy Graves were watching the live footage as Wayne Tower was destroyed. He then remarked to his assistant about the potential waste of the Wayne Enterprises technologies that would be lost in the attack.

Auction at the Hotel Grand Lux
Approximately two weeks after the Black Zero Event, Lex was part of a charity auction at the Hotel Grand Lux made to benefit the victims of the disaster. Lex and Mercy Graves surprised Bruce Wayne who, like Lex, would be auctioning off a bit of their time for the winning bidder. Bruce was immediately turned off by Lex's appearance. The situation only got worse when Lex's insincere condolence for the destruction of Wayne Tower focused upon the technologies that were lost in the attack, rather than the actual victims. After Bruce was promptly called off due to a developing situation, he made sure to emphasize that the winning bid for his time would garner double whatever Lex would offer.

Interview with Ron Troupe
Shortly before the release of his company's revolutionary new operating system Lex/OS, Lex Luthor was approached by reporter Ron Troupe, and agreed to meet him for 15 minutes at the opulent Royal Penthouse Suite at the Park Metropolis Downtown. Lex was then promptly interviewed on a number of subjects, including the alien hero Superman and the Gotham City vigilante Batman. Right afterwards, Lex offers to play bowling with Troupe, confident in his ability to "destroy" the latter.

Purchasing Hanford's holdings
Luthor standing in front of the ruins of his old building.
After Hanford Technologies was successfully exposed by Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane, Lex arrived at a construction site of the company, and announced that LexCorp Industries was purchasing all of Hanford's holdings (including the site), as well as retaining all of Hanford's employees, as he claimed that the employees should not suffer from the immoral actions of their former CEO. Lex proceeded to admit that despite his failings, Mark Hanford had been a good CEO, whose big mistake was selling illegal Kryptonian technology. Later, in the privacy of his car, with only his personal assistant Mercy Graves there to hear him, Lex finished - because there were so many more interesting things that could potentially be done with it.

Rebuilding of Metropolis
Due to Lex Luthor's prolific philanthropic efforts to help financially support the rebuilding of Metropolis (as well as his company, LexCorp Industries), local politicians and media personalities called the companies that left Metropolis traitors, while a growing number of corporations (including Kord Industries), inspired by Lex Luthor, decided to follow his example, with some of them who had previously planned to pull out of Metropolis reversing course, and others, that had never been in Metropolis at all, choosing to expand there. In addition, while funding the rebuilding of Metropolis, Lex also had the Lexor Hotel built, thus naming it after himself. Indeed, due to his actions, some even claimed that Lex was as much a hero to Metropolis as Superman himself. Lex, however, dismissed the comparison, claiming that the alien superhero was a figure too mysterious and controversial for him to be a good comparison, but in light of Superman's debut, Lex claimed that recognizing the importance of the "ordinary" citizens of Metropolis (such as rescue workers, first responders, and countless ordinary citizens, who also helped save others in the Black Zero Event) had become more important than ever.

Learning about Superman
Luthor collecting information
Lex then proceeded to return to his LexCorp facility, admitting to Mercy Graves that while him not knowing much about Superman is in fact completely true, he has been "working on changing that." With those words, Lex enters a private room with CCTV screens (displaying the corpse of General Dru-Zod, the Fortress of Solitude, and a Kryptonian DNA double helix), asking Mercy to make sure he isn't disturbed, as he plans to spend the rest of the day in there.

During this time, Lex had a woman named Teri meet with Professor Garcia and another man, who discussed the video footage of Superman saving a runaway train full of passengers. Teri spoke the words spoken to her through an earpiece by Lex (who had her appear to agree with Garcia), while the latter viewed the entire meeting from another CCTV screen.

Discovering metahumans
Luthor keeping an eye on Batman

During this time, Lex watched on as Firefly was paid to blow up a merchandise warehouse in Gotham City, in order to test out the capabilities of the infamous Batman. Lex set up another CCTV at the warehouse beforehand, in order to watch events unfold.
LexCorp data on Metahumans
Hence, it would be around this time that Lex learns everything about Batman and Superman (notably their alter-egos, powers, abilities, physical and emotional weaknesses, relationships, and psychological profiles), as well as that of other metahumans: the immortal Amazon demigoddess Wonder Woman (a World War I era photo of whom, together with Steve Trevor's team, which he obtained with facial recognition software), the Atlantean Aquaman (footage of whom he found in the Pacific with the NSA's UUV drones), the speedster Flash (footage of whom he obtained from a Central City pharmacy's security camera), and the technologically enhanced Cyborg (footage of whom he obtained from a video log on the S.T.A.R. Labs database).

Framing Superman for Nairomi
In order to carry out his plan, Lex employs Anatoli Knyazev and his men, arms them with innovative alloy bullets (which his company sold to the CIA, in turn selling them to Nairomian terrorists as a weapons test), and orders them to murder all of the men of the Nairomian terrorist warlord Amajagh as soon as Superman arrives (to save a captured Lois Lane), and for Knyazev to mutilate the corpses with his flamethrower, in order to make it look like Superman had murdered them with his heat vision.

Shortly thereafter, Lex hires and blackmails a Nairomian woman, Kahina Ziri, to lie and testify against Superman's actions in Nairomi to the US Senate, giving her a specific script to follow when speaking to Senator Finch. Hence, Kahina claims that her parents were among those killed in the incident after Superman's involvement.

Meeting Finch and Barrows
Senator Barrows and Lex
Lex Luthor himself is visited at LexCorp Industries by senators Finch and Barrows, and he proposes to them the idea of using the recently acquired kryptonite xenomineral as an official "silver bullet" deterrent against Superman, to hold him in check if the alien superhero were to ever decide to turn against humanity. In order to forge such a "silver bullet," Lex requests Finch to grant him an import license for the large piece of kryptonite (nicknamed "Emerald City" by Lex) lying in the Indian Ocean (at the wreckage of General Zod's World Engine). Finch leaves, considering the request, while Barrows stays, clearly intrigued by Lex, and intent to continue a discussion.

Lex quickly manages to persuade the good-natured senator Barrows to grant him access to the Fortress of Solitude, and to the corpse of General Zod. Lex rewards the cooperative politician with the cherry-flavored Jolly Ranchers, and is quick to exploit his new access - taking a good look around the Fortress, and subtly peeling off the fingerprints from General Zod's corpse (with a kryptonite-bladed scalpel).

The Red Capes are coming
Lex momentarily muses about his late father
Several days later, Senator Finch is escorted into Lex's study by his right-hand personal assistant Mercy Graves. Lex is initially excited to see her, offers her some whiskey (from her native state of Kentucky), and monologues about how he keeps everything in the study of his father, Alexander Luthor Sr., the same, musing that if he persistently did so, then perhaps his father would return. But Lex then dismisses this, as the "wistful thinking of orphan boys." 

Luthor smiles at Finch
Finch promptly tells Lex that she's decided not to grant him the import license. Lex is visibly enraged and sneers, beginning to nervously tap his fingers, begins to tell her what he considers to be the "oldest lie in America," but Finch physically stops him, letting Lex know that she sees right through his altruistic façade, telling him that he can "Take a bucket of piss and call it Granny's peach tea, take a weapon of assassination and call it deterrence," but that she wouldn't "drink it." Lex gives her a sinister grin, and states that he has considered turning an old picture of his father's (depicting a battle between Heaven's angels and Hell's demons) upside down (leaving the demons above, seemingly prevailing over the angels), and enigmatically telling her that "the Red Capes are coming." Finch then promptly departs.

Meeting Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent
Lex, Clark, and Bruce first meet
Lex organizes a fundraiser event at the Metropolis library, with the invited guests including Gotham City billionaire Bruce Wayne, Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent (with Lex specifically anonymously requesting Perry White that Clark be the one to attend and cover this event in the press), and Louvre Museum antiquities curator Diana Prince.

Lex, as the event's organizer, is therefore invited to make a speech. In it, he mentions the poor origins of his father, Alexander Luthor Sr. (who had once had trouble affording books in East Germany), and makes an allusion to the Ancient Greek story of how the Titan Prometheus was brutally punished by Zeus, King of the Old Gods, for enlightening humankind (much to the visible chagrin of Diana Prince, Zeus' daughter). Near the end of his speech, Lex acknowledges the "bittersweet truth" that knowledge is power, but he then suddenly stumbles over his words, internally realizing their contradiction when applied to him. Lex is then quick to end his address and excuse himself from the stage, successfully covering up his blunder.     

Lex then promptly walks up to Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent, interrupting their somewhat uncomfortable conversation about Batman and Superman. Lex enthusiastically introduces himself to them (aware that he is in fact speaking with Batman and Superman's alter egos), and, in order to continue slyly manipulating them into a conflict, complements the exceptional firmness of Clark's handshake, and therefore jokingly advises Bruce not "pick a fight with [Clark]." Determined to have Batman obtain the information regarding the kryptonite and Metahuman Thesis, Lex invites Bruce to visit the LexCorp Industries research and development facilities. However, at that moment, Mercy Graves comes up and lets Lex know that a governor wants to speak to him. So Lex is forced to excuse himself, with Bruce offering to possibly visit the facilities another time. Lex's plan, however, was still successful, as Bruce still obtained the information, having uploaded it unto a hacking device, though it was temporarily borrowed from him by Diana.

Smuggling Kryptonite
As a result of Senator Finch unexpectedly refusing to grant him an import license for the Indian Ocean kryptonite, Lex promptly decides to smuggle it in instead. Hence, he orders Anatoli Knyazev and his men to smuggle in the kryptonite to LexCorp Research Park (fully aware that Batman would try to intercept the transportation of the mineral as Lex intends for the vigilante to steal it). When Knyazev arrives at LexCorp Research Park with the stolen kryptonite (with this revealing that Batman had failed to steal the kryptonite although this was due to Superman's unforeseen intervention), Lex promptly examines it and exchanges a sinister sneer with Mercy Graves.

Bribing Keefe and bombing the Capitol
Luthor then had Knyazev organize Cesar Santos to be murdered by his fellow Blackgate Penitentiary inmates, while Lex himself pays the bail of embittered cripple Wallace Keefe (who was in the same prison as Santos) and invites him to visit his villa. Lex wants Keefe to testify against Superman in the upcoming Senate committee, and he gifts Keefe with a motorized wheelchair (made of an innovative metal alloy) to sweeten his deal.

Luthor stares at Senator Finch alongside Mercy Graves
Right after a guilt-ridden Kahina Ziri has left the US Capitol (managing to tell Senator Finch about Lex's exploitation of her), Lex arrives (just in time to see Finch whispering about Kahina's revelation to a fellow senator), and is present when Superman himself arrives to the hearing. However, before it begins, Lex asks Mercy Graves to reserve him a seat, before speaking to Senator Finch with an air of thinly-veiled condescension. Before leaving, Lex finally tells Finch the "oldest lie in America" - the belief that power can be innocent.

Shortly after the committee begins with the address of Senator Finch, Lex still hasn't arrived. Finch then suddenly notices a jar of urine standing on her desk, labelled "Granny's Peach Tea" (an epithet that she herself had used not along ago), which visibly startles her, making Finch pause mid-speech, horrified at the realization of what was about to occur. At that moment, a bomb (secretly planted inside Keefe's wheelchair by Lex) explodes, killing all present, except for the invulnerable, yet very mortified and heartbroken Superman. Because the wheelchair was lead-lined, Superman believed that it was his fault for purposely passing it. In order to tie up the last loose end, he has Knyazev permanently silence Kahina Ziri by pushing her under an incoming train, killing her.

Later that evening, Lex arrives at his LexCorp Research Park and witnesses a considerable trail of destruction left behind by Batman (who was induced by the red notes and recent events to finally take offensive action against Superman, by breaking into the well-guarded research park). As Lex steps inside the building, he observes a CCTV recorded footage of Batman seriously injuring all of the guards (swooping down on them from above, like an actual bat) despite their tireless attempts to shoot him (evidenced by the numerous cartridges lying on the floor in the aftermath that Lex also observes). Lex then approaches the object of his inquiry, which is the empty kryptonite chamber (with a batarang left in it by Batman for Lex to see). With this acting as final proof that Batman had successfully stolen the kryptonite, Lex smiles with sadistic glee at all the pieces of his grand plan finally beginning to fall together.

As the news ponders over the tragedy of the bombing and speculates about Superman's possible involvement behind it, Lex ominously stands atop the LexCorp Tower, and looks at the setting sun with a gleeful sneer on his face.

Entering the scout ship
Lex Luthor at the Fortress
With Finch and Barrows out of the way and most of the public in hateful opposition to Superman, Lex finally uses the fingerprints of General Zod to enter the Fortress of Solitude, and re-insert Zod's command key into it, bringing the dormant starship online again. The AI's voice inquires if Lex intends to assume command, to which he answers affirmatively, though Lex is visibly somewhat nervous at first. 

Lex quickly learns that the starship's Kryptonian archive has accumulated knowledge from 100,000 alien worlds, and he demands to be taught all of it, further enhancing his already brilliant mind to supergenius level. Among the tremendous amount of new knowledge Lex gains, he learns of the ancient Kryptonian monster Doomsday, and of invading extraterrestrial Parademon army of the New God Steppenwolf, of Steppenwolf's fearsome master Darkseid, and of the Unity. Lex seemed so excited about his discoveries concerning the New Gods and Apokolips, that he draws symbols of the 3 Mother Boxes compromising the Unity numerous times in coded notes.

Lex then decides to re-create Doomsday as a second contingency plan, in case Batman fails to bring Superman down. In order to begin the lengthy process, Lex brings in General Zod's corpse (lamenting that the Kryptonian invader had "[flown] too close to the sun") into the Genesis Chamber, cuts his own palm, and pours his own blood onto Zod's face. The starship's AI warns Lex that re-creating the fearsome monster was forbidden by the Kryptonian Law Council long ago, but Lex notes that the council is long-gone, along with its destroyed planet, and therefore orders the process to commence.

Ultimatum for Superman
Luthor talks with Lois Lane
While Doomsday is still forming, Lex continues his first contingency plan by having Knyazev's men kidnap Martha Kent, and later kidnap Lois Lane and bring her before him, to the top of LexCorp Tower. When joined by her, Lois angrily confronts Lex about the innovative metal fired during the Nairomi Incident, and calling him psychotic. Lex, however, dismisses that as a mere  "3 syllable word for any thought too big for little minds." He then seemingly digresses, starting to talk about circles and triangles, eventually ending with Euclid's triangle inequality: "the shortest distance between any two points, is a straight path. And I believe the straightest path to Superman is a pretty little road called Lois Lane." As he utters the last word, Lex promptly pushes Lois off the ledge of LexCorp Tower. 

Just as Lex had anticipated, Superman promptly arrives, saving her just in time. Superman flies back up, and angrily threatens to bring the ambitious supergenius in "without breaking [him]." However, Luthor confidently retorts by revealing that he is aware of Superman's secret identity, and proceeds to tell Clark about his views on both him and God, stating that "God is tribal." Lex then reveals that his father, Alexander Luthor Sr., while seemingly affable in public, was egregiously cruel and evil behind closed doors, thereby abusing his defenseless son with both fists and "abominations." Due to there having been no "man in the sky" to protect Lex from this suffering, he subsequently became a traumatized militant misotheist, burdened by the theological problem of evil (that if God is truly omnipotent, then He cannot be omnibenevolent, and vice versa), and concluding that power cannot be innocent. Hence, Superman (whom Lex compares to the deities Horus, Apollo, and Jehovah), due to his own godlike power, has the same problem of evil applicable to him in Lex's eyes, and Lex is now determined to prove this to the world by having him engage Batman in a mortal duel (revealing Wallace's relief check/ghost messaging's sent to Bruce were his handiwork), the "greatest gladiator match in the history of the world."

Superman, forced to bow to Lex Luthor, and comply to his ultimatum
When Superman attempts to refuse, Lex reveals that the former's mother, Martha Kent, is held in captivity in a top-secret location by Knyazev (producing several photos of a horrified Martha tied up with the word "Witch" written on her forehead in her own blood as proof). An incredibly furious Superman seems ready to destroy Lex with his heat vision, but the latter says that if Superman attempts to kill him or fly away, Martha will be burned alive, and the only way for Superman to save her, is to fly to Gotham City, fight and kill Batman in a vicious duel to the death, and subsequently bring the vigilante's head to Lex. Regardless of how the fight ends, however, Lex is confident that it will still expose the theological problem of evil represented by Superman - if Superman defeats and kills Batman (to save his mother's life) he will prove to be supremely powerful yet not supremely good, and if Superman loses (due to holding back, and his weakness to kryptonite) to Batman and dies, he will prove to be supremely good yet not supremely powerful. And in turn, which ever one of the two heroes survives the mortal duel and confronts Lex, is destined to be destroyed when Lex unleashes Doomsday.

An incredibly furious Superman is left with no choice but to comply with Lex's ultimatum, and he flies off, much to the delight of Lex, who gleefully muses that now "God bends to [his] will."

The death of Superman
Unleashing Doomsday
Luthor is confronted by Superman in the Fortress
Lex then goes to the Fortress of Solitude, awaiting Superman's return, as Doomsday's animation is nearing completion. As the clock reached its end, Lex picks it up from the table and casually shrugs as time runs out. Having mostly recovered from Batman's kryptonite gas grenades, Superman flies to the Fortress and smashes through the starship's hull to face Lex. The oblivious Luthor then proceeds to the phone to contact Knyazev, only to find out that the mercenary was dead, Batman allied with Superman and Martha was safe. The unyielding supergenius, however is unfazed by the news of his failed plan, claims not to know how to lose, reaffirms his unconditional misotheistic hatred of Superman (who's "sin" is his very existence), and is quick to reveal his secret contingency plan - a massive hybrid Kryptonian monster grown from General Zod's corpse and Lex's blood, Superman's "Doomsday." Lex gleefully added that now God (represented by Superman) was "as good as dead," since the "Devil" (represented by Doomsday) would succeed in "killing God" where Batman had failed.

The gigantic monster then proceeds to swiftly break out of the ship's birthing matrix and hurls a monstrous punch at Lex. However, the punch is intercepted by Superman, who blocks and counters with a mighty blow of his own. The battling duo then proceed to break out of the Fortress, continuing their mortal duel, much to Lex's delight. 

Lex's grandiose contingency plan is ultimately successful, as Superman is ultimately killed while taking down the monstrous Doomsday, to the dismay of Batman, Wonder Woman, and Lois, who all witness his final heroic sacrifice.

Communion and arrest
Luthor making contact with Steppenwolf
At the same time that Superman was dying from the monster's blows, Superman's screams could be heard reverberating through the ground, reaching into the Kryptonian craft and the Genesis Chamber where Lex stood, hearing the reverberations and nodding, as if understanding their significance. He then returned his attention back to watching the Liquid Geo projection of the New God Steppenwolf activating a Mother Box.

A SWAT team then sets out to investigate the Kryptonian Ship.

As they enter the Kryptonian craft's Genesis Chamber, the team briefly sees Lex still sitting in front of a projection of Steppenwolf, holding three Apokoliptan Mother Boxes. However, the projection is dispersed almost at once, and Lex turns, to face them, with guns aiming all at him. Lex then surrenders without a fight.

Visited by Batman
Luthor being threatened by Batman in prison

Shortly after his imprisonment in Belle Reve supermax prison as a supercriminal, Lex Luthor (now shaven-headed) is unexpectedly visited in his jail cell by Batman, with the latter expressing his anger at Lex's actions, pinning the unabated supergenius against a wall and threatening him, but Lex boldly counters, by sneering and revealing that he knows Batman's secret identity, but that nobody would believe him, as Lex is perceived to be insane. Batman then reveals to a dismayed Lex that he has arranged for the latter to be taken to Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane. Lex, however, swiftly regains his composure
Luthor sadistically mocking Batman
, sneers again, and states that "God" is now dead, and that there is something else, something bigger coming, from outer space. Seething with rage, Batman punches the wall with his branding-ring, leaving the mark of a bat symbol on the wall. When Lex turns his head, he sees that Batman has disappeared. He yells at the Dark Knight, that the bells are ringing, and gleefully warns him about Darkseid's arrival on Earth and then he begins mockingly mimicking the dinging sounds, knowing he would find the metahumans and stop him, retaining his confidence in the Dark Knight until the very end.

Escape from Arkham
Luthor meets with Deathstroke.
Two years after the death of Superman, around the time of Steppenwolf's arrival and his defeat at the hands of those Lex reluctantly believed in, Lex escaped Arkham Asylum to retreat to a lavish private yacht, with a group of female bodyguards. Shortly thereafter, Lex contacted the notorious mercenary Deathstroke, inviting him to his boat which was located in Monaco. There, he began to discuss a mysterious plan involving Deathstroke's nemesis, the Batman. Luthor informed Deathstroke that Batman's true identity was Bruce Wayne, and the two then discussed what to do next. In the wake of his escape, the Daily Planet reported that experts put the blame on Luthor for the alien invasion that occurred in Pozharnov Russia.


Personality
Lex, finally revealing his true colors.
Being extremely intelligent, eccentric, self-conscious, ambitious, courageous, and charismatic, Lex is actually the ultimate living personification of intellectualism, quite possibly the greatest mind in the world (in many ways considerably intellectually superior to even most geniuses), using this tremendous power as an altruistic humanist, a man of and for the people (with Lex comparing himself to the enlightening gift-giving figure of Prometheus, and supporting it well with his superb demagogic skills). While he would appear an ideal image of human perfection, this nature of his is tainted to a hideous degree by his horrifically unstable ego deriving from his high horse and his low morality deriving from his cruel and traumatic upbringing, meaning he has little inhibition about seeing the world prosper only as he sees fit. Lex's ultimate wish aside from the power he seeks to better humanity according to his own wisdom is to destroy those that he deems as his competition - namely his nemesis Superman, who he foresees destroying humanity altogether n direct contradiction to his own desire to elevate us to our peak, although he also feels (much less) threatened by metahumans in general (specifically Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash, and Cyborg of the Justice League) and so puts a lot of effort into keeping close tabs on them. Furthermore, Lex's ruthless attempts to prevent Superman from ever having apocalyptic ramifications imply psychopathy, as they are extremely immoral and egregiously ruthless, with him having little care for the methods he uses, or their impact on others, so he is actually the ultimate embodiment of a utilitarian "the ends justify the means" mindset, as he (unlike Bruce Wayne) knows not whether something as extreme as the Knightmare will come to be, but not caring. This is shown when he confesses that he detests not Superman himself, but the theoretical Knightmare, before citing his mere presence is making bad things happen, meaning simply existing makes him sinful in Lex's eyes, an oxymoron. Feeling threatened on a personal level because of what Superman's power means for him, and on an external level because of how Superman's attachment to his mother and girlfriend are his extremely conditional reasons for wanting to keep the world in one piece, Lex is envious and bitter enough to openly describe the former in infernal and diabolical terms, subtly comparing Superman to a werewolf (by referring to kryptonite as a "silver bullet"), a "flying demon" (which he uses to justify his threat of ruthlessly burning Martha Kent alive), and finally, to the biblical Satan himself, who had originated not in "Hell beneath [Lex]," but had come "from the sky" (as a fallen archangel), inducing humanity to admire him. Lex shares similar sentiments towards metahumans in general, though colloquially addressing them as "the basis of [humanities] myths," "exceptional beings" and "gods among men" living on Earth. As he highlighted the notion of planetary security to Senator Finch, Lex also categorized the danger presented in their presence, citing them in the same vein of diabolism as Superman, stating if the government forged their silver bullet but didn't use it then "[mankind] won't have to depend on the kindness of monsters." 

This immense fear and hatred of powerful individuals with popularity seemingly stems from the great amounts of apprehension and resentment that Lex harbors for his late father, Alexander Luthor Sr., as the latter, while both powerful and popular, was extremely cruel and egregious behind closed doors, physically abusing his young and helpless son with both fists and "abominations." Thus, Lex's experienced abuse, without any intervention from any "man in the sky," immensely traumatizes him, which in turn induces Lex to gain a militantly misotheistic view of God, believing that if God were omnipotent, then his benevolence logically could not be absolute and vice versa (the theological problem of evil), thereby solidifying his belief that power cannot be innocent (referring to the antithesis of that as the "oldest lie in America"). 

Somewhat ironically, despite his misotheism, Lex has a penchant for constantly implementing allusions to major figures of both pagan and biblical theology, with him notably comparing himself to Prometheus, General Zod to Icarus, and Superman to Zeus, Horus, Apollo, Jehovah, and Satan. He even compares himself to the biblical God in one way, claiming albeit insightfully to hate "the sin, not the sinner," and plays God by creating the monster Doomsday. When making these allusions, however, Lex tends to cast these theologies' supreme gods in a not very discreet negative light (expertly finding the right myths for that, as he did with Zeus' punishment of Prometheus), to the point that Wonder Woman was visibly enraged by Lex's description of Zeus and the Old Gods.

Ironically, while the egregious abuse would make Lex immensely despise his father, he would eventually come to share some of his father's traits as an adult, though it could be argued that Lex took all of these traits even further, as he would notably become more intelligent, skilled, relentless, and powerful than his father had ever been. However, this is hard to pin down as little is known about Luthor Sr. at all. Hence, Lex projects his childhood trauma and theological resentment onto the godlike Superman, determined to prove to both himself and to humanity at large that the alien superhero, while being supremely powerful, is actually not supremely good, and is in fact an abominable fraud. However, Lex notably does not have the same hatred towards General Zod, and actually seems to admire him, with Lex tearfully remarking that the latter had "[flown] too close to the sun." This is most likely due the fact that General Zod, unlike Superman, did not contradict Lex's worldview, due to Zod's godlike power being used for the benevolent intent of preserving a race rather than avenging a loved one.

Ultimately however, while Lex does somewhat admire General Zod, he proves himself to be a considerably greater enemy for Superman. Zod, after all, had initially tried to persuade Superman to side with him, and had genuinely cared for his allies (especially his closest and most trusted one, Faora-Ul), all while seeking to protect, save and resurrect what remained of his destroyed beloved world and his race. Lex, by contrast, is far more relentless and ruthless and pragmatic, as he instantly resolves to become enemies with Superman (viewing the latter's very existence as a "sin"), was willing to become a supercriminal, committing unspeakable crimes against peace and humanity, all for the purpose of destroying his nemesis (and what the latter represents) to prevent the end of days, of proving his cynical ideology and points (based in the theological problem of evil), and of reaffirming his deluded, megalomaniacal godly self-image to himself, while ultimately being egregiously egotistical, not caring about anyone other than himself, as even Doomsday (Lex's own Frankensteinian creation, whom Lex thought of as a surrogate son of sorts) and Mercy Graves (Lex's closest and most trusted ally) were ultimately disposable to him, being but means to an end. Still, their silver gleaming as their fervent and righteous determination to protect and preserve their race, with only their methods of doing so actually making them immoral. Lex even shows himself to enjoy a good fight, since right before Lex is about to ruthlessly have Senator Finch killed, and later when he threatens to ruthlessly burn Martha Kent alive, Lex actually manages to find both situations funny, and cracks several sinister black humor pun jokes, with gleeful sadism. In addition, while all of Superman's other haters and detractors were guilt-ridden following his death and mourned him, with even the exceptionally amoral Amanda Waller posthumously respecting him, while even the brutal and cynical Batman was inspired by him to better himself, Lex was as gleeful as ever, in utter defiance of himself being exposed as a super criminal and incarcerated in Belle Reve supermax.

Because of how complex his mind is and how young the man himself is, Lex has shown to have ticks implying moderate mental imbalance. This is shown by him rubbing his arm against a display case or drumming his fingers against a wall, although he has even been shown to have fits of psychotic frustration and rage when talking to a large group of people and not knowing what to say, due to his extremely convoluted mind being otherwise occupied at that moment. Hence, when Lois Lane pettily calls him "psychotic," Lex smugly dismisses that word as merely referring to "any thought too big for little minds." Due to his aforementioned God complex he shares with Enchantress that only his way can bring order that lasts, Lex, despite his ability to kill Superman himself (with the acquired kryptonite), instead waits for the opportune moment to manipulate Superman and Batman into a fierce mortal duel, in order to first discredit the Man of Steel, so as to avoid Superman becoming a martyr, and to simultaneously humiliate Superman, by having a being of godlike power killed by an ordinary man (supported by Lex' many biblical allusions when gloatingly describing the heroes' planned mortal duel). Overall, while actually sane and only feigning insanity during his Belle Reve supermax imprisonment, Lex had in fact grown increasingly unhinged, due to the existential crisis that opposing Superman induced within him. Lex takes smug pride in his phenomenal intellect, usually sadistically thinking of others as his inferiors and pawns (managing to slyly reveal, for instance, that he is aware of Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent's alter egos, without them realizing it, and smugly sneering at the prospect of knowing something that Batman doesn't when the latter ambushes him in Belle Reve), proudly proclaiming how easy it had been for him to outsmart and manipulate even the experienced tactical and detective genius Batman, in addition to claiming that the exceptionally smart and insightful Lois Lane has only a "little mind" compared to his. Indeed, Lex's reliance on intellect and contingencies make him far more effective than almost all other supervillains. Hence, like, Amanda Waller, Lex is a manipulative and devious leverager, but an even more effective one than her, as Lex relies on more than just leverage, and never allows leverage-based power to become his weakness. Just like Enchantress, Lex is driven purely by a single-minded desire to order things according to his own wisdom, akin to a God complex, though he consistently relies far more on intellect and plans, never allowing arrogance to become his weakness. Like General Zod, Lex is a ruthless and indomitable winner who refuses to lose, though even more effective, due to not being limited by thinking boundaries or dogmatic tunnel vision. Like the Joker, Lex bears a penchant for unspeakable crimes, though far more covert and implicit, and hence far more successful at keeping those crimes from getting tied to him, although his crimes are also committed for the greater good as opposed to anarchy for its own sake. Like Ares, Lex is an incredible deceiver who covertly manipulates his enemies and superbly hides in plain sight, though he has a greater number of contingencies planned. Finally, Lex is as intelligent as his nemesis Superman is powerful, making Lex a worthy opponent for him, more than capable of gaining the upper hand against the mighty alien, despite his own lack of metahuman powers.   

Still, Lex was ultimately a heroic, enlightening, and altruistic humanist, even comparing himself to humanity's savior Prometheus, since Lex does indeed actually firmly believe in the importance of bettering humankind to its peak, and Lex claims that he wants to "elevate the right people, the right human people" in order to "leave the planet in better shape for the next generation, to make the world and its children safer." Indeed, his LexCorp Industries mission statement is: "Let's build a better tomorrow today," while the specified one for Lex/Os is: "Help us build a more human system." Due to Batman epitomizing many of these humanist beliefs (having bettered himself both mentally and physically to his peak, without any superhuman assistance, making him capable of pulling off terrific feats without actually being superhuman), Lex genuinely admires him, despite Batman being his enemy and business rival, and Lex therefore selects the tremendously skilled vigilante to be his champion against Superman and the metahumans. Lex does not, however, view Batman as an equal, as he takes pride in his intellectual superiority, smugly proclaiming how easy it had been for him to deceive the vigilante into unknowingly becoming his pawn after he had awkwardly thrown aside his spear and agreed to help Superman. Lex appears to respect Deathstroke for similar reasons. Lex is phenomenally brilliant in sciences and business, as well as tactics and strategy (to the point that he boldly claims not to know how to lose), and is thereby practically always the smartest man in a room.  

Lex is also incredibly brave, almost completely fearless, showing no signs of fear when confronted by an angry Superman, and even when unexpectedly ambushed in his Belle Reve supermax jail cell and at the mercy of a furious Batman with a branding ring (although Lex's sneer momentarily disappeared when Batman informed him about his transfer to Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane), with Lex going so far as smugly sneering at Batman's threats, gloating over Superman's death with gleeful sadism, and equally sadistically warning Batman about the imminent coming of a new, mysterious alien invader, Darkseid, to whom Earth is now vulnerable to, due to Superman's death, although he may have simply intended to do all in his current power to goad him into bringing superheroes together. 

Lex does, however, have several prominent fears, the biggest of which, even more than that of losing his own life, being his fear of losing intellectual power and self-righteous control, so yet another factor of Lex's resentment towards Superman was his outrage over the latter not deserving his godlike power (a legitimate claim), while feeling that instead, he is the one that deserves it, due to Lex being a self-made man (amassing his supergenius intellect, building up LexCorp Industries, and earning himself a phenomenal fortune in a superhuman business feat) from a difficult and traumatic upbringing. Indeed, due to this existential sense of entitlement, Lex epitomizes the Easterlin Paradox - being absolutely tormented, miserable, and full of rage, despite also being tremendously rich and successful Therefore, Lex values control above all else, so much so, that he places himself above Superman, and almost asks Superman to tear him apart, in their first confrontation. Hence, when confronted with his greatest fear, Lex shows himself to be a fatalist, as he used Doomsday as his last-ditch effort to destroy his nemesis, although he knew the damage wrought in the Skirmish under Gotham Harbor was dwarfed by the Insurgency.

While Lex's god complex does occasionally make him arrogant and overconfident, this weakness of his (unlike with supervillains like Ares, Enchantress, General Zod, General Ludendorff, or Amanda Waller) is ultimately an insignificant one, as Lex's tremendous intellect and cold calculation allow him to very effectively compensate for this at almost all times, mastering almost any situation with his numerous tactical contingencies, and even though he does express a level of shock whenever one of his plans fail and he has to resort to one of his less ethical contingencies, he is very quick to recover from it. Hence, when Senator Finch unexpectedly refuses to grant Lex an import license for the Indian Ocean kryptonite, he promptly smuggles it in instead; when a guilt-ridden Kahina Ziri unexpectedly confesses her lies to Finch, Lex promptly has them both killed; when Batman and Superman unexpectedly stop their duel, team up and save Martha Kent, Lex promptly unleashes Doomsday upon them, killing Superman; when Lex's numerous unspeakable crimes get exposed and result in Belle Reve supermax imprisonment, Lex promptly makes himself unfit to stand trial by convincingly feigning insanity; and when Lex learns of his unexpected transfer to Arkham Asylum, he regains his confidence mere seconds later, due to Lex having adapted a contingency plan for a break-out from Arkham (and subsequent retreat to a contingency private yacht) at the optimal time. Even after Superman is resurrected from the dead more powerful than before and cements together the Justice League, Lex is as confident as ever in face of this greater challenge, and swiftly chooses this as the optimal time to escape Arkham, retreats to the contingency yacht, and meets up with Deathstroke to discuss founding "a league of [his] own", to continue to maintain balance according to his own judgement.
