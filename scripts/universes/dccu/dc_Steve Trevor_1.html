Stephen "Steve" Trevor was a United States Army Air Service officer working for British Intelligence as a spy, as well as an ally and lover of the superheroine Wonder Woman, being literally the first man she had ever met. 

During World War I, he had a secretary named Etta Candy. He, Diana and the Wonder Men helped thwart the plans of General Ludendorff, Dr. Poison, and Ares himself, while seemingly sacrificing his life in the process. 

In 1984, decades after his death, he was able to live once more when Diana wished for his return using a magical object, causing him to be placed inside a host's body. During the riots around the White House, Steve convinced Diana to renounce her wish, as to restore her powers.

Biography
World War I
Meeting Wonder Woman

Steve Trevor served as a United States Army Air Service Captain in World War I. Steve was on a mission in an Ottoman Empire base. There, he managed to steal a notebook containing the gaseous toxicology research of Doctor Poison.
Diana rescues and meets Steve Trevor for the first time
The notebook details a new deadlier form of mustard gas which could annihilate the Allied forces, and win the war for the German Empire. Steve stole a plane from the base to escape with the notebook; however, he was shot down in open sea. He crash-landed near the island of Themyscira. He was saved from drowning by the Amazon princess  Diana. As he came to, she asked Steve if he was a man, due to Diana  never having come across a male before in her life. Though somewhat confused, Steve affirmed that he was, rhetorically asking if he looked like one. Steve aided Diana and the Amazons defending the beach against a German invasion force where he took down a German soldier and used his rifle to shoot at least two other German soldiers.

Steve Trevor talking with Diana
After the battle, he was put on trial in front of the Amazons and was questioned. The Lasso of Hestia compelled him to reveal his mission and the fact that he was a spy despite his attempts to resist. While recovering, he was approached by Diana and they eventually escaped the island for London on a boat, in which the pair talked and slept side by side.

Guiding Wonder Woman
Diana saving Steve from a bullet
When they arrived in London, Steve accompanied Diana through the streets while explaining some things to them such as why people hold hands and then along with his secretary Etta Candy, they went to get Diana new clothes. Steve delivered the notebook to his superiors at high command but they refused to act which seemed to anger Diana. Steve and Diana were leaving where they told them. how they were going anyway and wrapped the Lasso of Hestia around his wrist to prove to Diana that he was, without doubt, telling the truth.

The Wonder Men

The following day, Steve along with Diana and his team of Wonder Men decide to go to No Man's Land. Steve, along with his team, assisted Diana as she block the bullets with her bracelet and her shield.

Steve and his team then assisted Diana as they fight off against a group of German soldiers, fighting off more Germans invading the Belgian village of Veld, in result, saving the village. After liberating the village from German occupation, a local took a photograph of Steve with Diana and his team.

Death

Steve infiltrated a gathering of Germans during a Gala, but was unable to complete his goal due to Diana. He and his team were then separated from Diana while she fought Ares to destroy the gas. Steve told Diana he loved her and give her his watch. He then boarded the plane storing the gas, fought, defeated two German soldiers and then flew the plane as high as he could. Steve drew his pistol and shot the gas igniting it and destroying the plane preventing the distribution of the gas, supposedly resulting in his own death.

Aftermath of his First Death

Due to his heroic actions, a prize was given in his honor. Diana was later pictured at a place called 'Trevor Ranch', presumably named after him.

1984
Steve was revived unwittingly in 1984 by the power of the Dreamstone after Diana wished to be reunited with him. He reawakened in another man's body and after getting his bearings, he began to search for Diana. He found her address after searching for her in the phone book and shadowed her before revealing himself to her at a fundraising function at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History where Diana was employed. His advances were initially rebuffed but Diana eventually recognized Steve and the two embraced. They shared the night together before Diana began to realize something was amiss relating to Steve's revival and began to search for information on the Dreamstone.

Legacy
Nearly a century after Steve's first death, the photograph taken in Belgium was eventually discovered by Lex Luthor, who compiled it into his footage of all the other metahumans. While discussing the implications of heroism with Bruce Wayne, Diana mentioned why she had walked away from humanity all those years ago. Sometime later, the photo of the Wonder Men is eventually returned to Diana by Bruce Wayne.

When assembling a team to fight off the threat posed by alien invaders, Diana invoked the memory of Steve to Victor Stone, citing Steve's death as the reason for her wanting to retreat from the world.

Personality
Steve Trevor, as a soldier, is remarkably courageous, bold, dedicated, and determined, while also an exceptionally cunning, improvisational, and capable spy. While originally somewhat cynical and narrow-minded, Steve's background as a spy makes him tactful (hence he rarely voices his skepticism of Diana's story of Ares, or her Amazonian beliefs, and doesn't hold Charlie's PTSD or Chief's anti-colonial bitterness against them), while also capable of improvising and spinning convincing lies in tough situations. Steve's dedication is shown by his desire to end World War I, and to contribute to that he usually follows protocol, but disobeys orders when disagreeing with them, specifically when British Intelligence superiors' orders prohibit him from taking active initiative. This is due to Steve following in the footsteps of his father, who believed in the importance of acting when one wanted to make a difference. While initially cynical, and disbelieving Diana's story (despite both Sameer and Chief coming to believe it), seeing Wonder Woman's compassion and unbreakable spirit in action renews Steve's hope, boosting his morale and energizing him to cross over to the German trench after her, freeing a Belgian village from cruel occupation, and no longer hesitating against seemingly insurmountable odds. As an espionage expert, Steve also has immense willpower, enough to even resist the Lasso of Hestia for several seconds.

Steve displays a softer side after meeting and gradually falling in love with Wonder Woman, explaining to her the customs of humanity, being understanding of her naive social blunders, genuinely admitting his own lack of understanding of some human customs (such as marriage and family life), and eventually starting to tactfully woo her. He soon comes to understand Diana's true potential, and right before he selflessly yet seemingly sacrifices himself (to thwart Ares' plan and finally end the World War I for good), he passionately expresses his unwavering belief in Diana's ability to save the world, as well as his unwavering love for her. Indeed, just as much as Diana had several days prior inspired him, so did Steve's final moments in the Great War before going MIA inspire her, with Diana clinging to their mutual love in order to bypass her ambivalence and violent tendencies, and to defeat Ares for good. Diana's love and respect for Steve's alleged final sacrifice were so immense, that even 100 years later, she would be rendered tearful by the memory of it, and Superman's own actions and sacrifice inspired Diana mainly because she saw a lot of Steve Trevor in him.

Abilities
Gifted Intellect: Steve is exceptionally intelligent (despite his occasional cynicism at new unexpected revelations), which extends to his considerable acting, deception and espionage skills, making Steve Trevor a very valuable spy for the British Intelligence. However, he is notably not as intelligent as Ares who quite easily deceived Steve and his entire team into believing that he was their ally.
Expert Spy: Steve is an extremely skilled spy, working for British Intelligence, successfully impersonating a German officer and infiltrating Doctor Poison's base in the Ottoman Empire, using the same impersonation to enter General Ludendorff's party in Belgium, expertly imitating a German accent, and almost succeeding in wooing Doctor Poison by impersonating a sadistic and bloodthirsty officer interested in her work (only failing due to getting distracted by Wonder Woman).
Expert Deceiver: Steve, due to being an experienced, skilled and persuasive liar (at least on par with Sameer, though still surpassed by Ares quite a bit), was claiming to Diana that he lies for a living, was able to see right though Sameer's lying charade in a bar, able to fool his British superiors into believing that he wouldn't go to Belgium (while in actuality, he instead covertly assembled the infiltration Wonder Men team), able to swiftly give Diana Prince|Diana the human name "Diana Prince", and the Amazons only get Steve to tell the truth by using the Lasso of Hestia on him (though he notably resisted it for a few seconds).
Expert Leader: Steve is very capable and charismatic leader, having lead the organized the Wonder Men in the first portion of their mission to defeat General Ludendorff, until Wonder Woman eventually took up the lead as the mission continued from the Belgian trench.
Expert Pilot: Steve is a highly skilled pilot, successfully escaping pursuing German planes after flying off with Dr. Poison's plans, and crash-landing his plane in the sea outside Themyscira. His skill also extends to water-based vehicles, a she told Diana that he knew how to sail a boat.

Steve Trevor aiming his shotgun
Expert Marksman: Steve is a highly skilled marksman, usually taking German soldiers out with a single shot in World War I battles, thus instantly bringing down Antiope's killer. When he and the Wonder Men reclaimed a German village from Ludendorff's soldiers, he accurately shot a bundle of grenades adhered to a wall, thrown by Chief, to explode the wall and clear a pathway for the Wonder Men to enter the German village. Lastly, he shot the supply of mustard gas on the plane to help end the Great War.
Skilled Combatant: Steve is fairly skilled in close-quarters combat, notably beating down most of General Ludendorff's spies when he was caught unarmed, and effectively using his gun as a blunt striking weapon when not having sufficient time to take a shot at close-standing enemies. In 1984, he easily contended with Bialyan guards and Max Lord's security.
Indomitable Will: Steve Trevor has immense determination and strength of will, due to believing in the importance of taking active initiative when one wanted to make a difference, hence Steve disobeys orders from his British Intelligence superiors when he disagrees with them, in order to do what he knows to be right. Despite seeing the many horrors of World War I, Steve refuses to ever hunker down and give up, something he becomes even more adamant about after meeting and fighting alongside with Wonder Woman, who inspires him to act against seemingly insurmountable odds. As a result, Steve was even able to resist the Lasso of Hestia for several seconds, and he didn't hesitate to selflessly sacrifice his own life in order to thwart Ares' plans and end the war for good. Indeed, just as much as Diana had several days prior inspired him, so did Steve's final moments inspire her, with Diana clinging to their mutual love in order to bypass her ambivalence and violent tendencies, and to defeat Ares for good. Indeed, Superman's own actions, willpower and sacrifice inspired Wonder Woman 100 years later mainly because she saw a lot of Steve Trevor in him.
Equipment
Mauser C96: Steve Trevor, due to being a British spy impersonating a German officer, is seen using Mauser Pistol on battlefields and missions.
Colt M1911: Steve drew this pistol when confronting Diana after the latter killed Ludendorff, and used it to shoot the supply of mustard gas in the German plane he stole during his courageous sacrifice.
Mauser Gewehr 1898: Steve took this rifle from a German soldier when he was found on Themyscira, using it to kill Antiope's killer.
Winchester 1897: Steve's service weapon is a shotgun. He expertly used it during the Battle of Veld and while taking back a German village from Ludendorff's soldiers.

He later marries Diana. In Post-Crisis, Steve Trevor and Diana are only close friends and Steve went on to marry his secretary Etta Candy. In the New 52, Steve Trevor is alive and well in the modern age and is also the head of A.R.G.U.S.
