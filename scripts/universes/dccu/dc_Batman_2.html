<html><p>Sometime later, Batman visits the Belle Reve jail cell of the imprisoned and now shaven-headed Lex Luthor, expressing his extreme rage at Lex for his actions including how he deceived him. Batman pins him against the wall and threatens Lex with his branding ring, but Luthor boldly counters by sneering and revealing that he knows Batman's secret identity, but that nobody would believe him, as Lex is perceived to be insane. Batman then reveals to a dismayed Lex that he has arranged for the latter to be taken to Arkham Asylum and that some "friends" will be there for him. Lex, however, swiftly regains his composure, sneers again, and states that "God" is now dead, and due to that, there is something else, something and someone bigger coming, from outer space. Batman then defiantly punches the wall with his branding-ring, leaving the mark of a bat symbol on the wall. When Luthor turns his head back, Batman disappears. He yells at the Dark Knight in defiance, that 'the bells have already been rung', and warns that "he" was coming to Earth, after that Lex began to mimicking the bell sounds, mockingly.

Dawn of justice
Bruce and Diana at Clark's funeral
Bruce, Diana, and Lois Lane attend the funeral of Clark Kent in Smallville (with Bruce himself paying for it, as an anonymous donor), along with Pete Ross, Lana Lang, and Father Daniel Leone, who presides over it.

Bruce and Diana remain at the cemetery afterward, and Bruce, guilt-ridden over having "failed [Superman] in life" (mainly due to Bruce's horrible actions against Superman, and due to Bruce having wasted 2 kryptonite gas grenades on him, while they might have instead been used to kill Doomsday without losing Superman), asks her to help him honor Superman's heroic sacrifice by helping him bring together the three metahumans from Lex Luthor's file (the Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg), in case a threat of that scale ever should arise again. Diana inquires why Bruce is proposing it. He replies that it is simply due to a feeling he has that things will imminently get worse.

Meeting Amanda Waller
Bruce Wayne speaking to Amanda Waller
After her Suicide Squad successfully defeated the mystical duo of Enchantress and Incubus in Midway City and saved her, Amanda Waller met up with her situational ally Bruce Wayne, asking him to take care of the rumors following the aftermath of the calamitous events, and in exchange, she gave Wayne her files on multiple notable metahumans, including that of Enchantress, Aquaman, and the Flash. As Wayne turned to leave, Waller let him know that she is aware that he is Batman. Unfazed, he immediately, sternly warned Waller to shut down Task Force X, letting her know that if she doesn't, he and his new "friends" will shut it down for her.

Correspondence with Diana
Ever since Diana Prince had returned to her job at the Louvre Museum after Superman's funeral, Bruce stayed in touch with her, hoping that she would consider his offer. He eventually discovered the original physical photograph of Diana with Steve Trevor's team, and sent it to her packed within a Wayne Enterprises package. A tearful Diana e-mailed Bruce back, thanking him for returning Steve to her.

Forming the Justice League
Recruiting Arthur Curry
Wayne arriving to the village to find Arthur Curry.
Wayne learned from Amanda Waller's files that Arthur Curry visited a village in Iceland (as a mysterious "stranger from the sea") during the winter, bringing fish to feed the hungry, always coming on the king tide. On the day right after the king tide, Wayne arrived at the village and asked to speak with Curry. When Curry revealed himself to be there, standing among the villagers, Wayne let the latter know that an impending enormous threat is coming to the world, and asked Curry to join the Justice League under his leadership.

Wayne meeting Arthur Curry
Curry, however, upon Wayne revealing his ability to speak Icelandic, reacted hostilely, proceeding to angrily lift and pin Wayne against the wall, ultimately refusing to join..

Going over members for the team
After Curry refused Wayne's offer, he and Pennyworth got back on the jet and headed back to Gotham City. While on the jet, Wayne finished up shaving his face, they began to go over the other members for the team like Barry Allen and Diana.

Learning of the Age of Heroes
When Wayne got back to Gotham, he began to work on the Flying Fox at a Wayne Aerospace Hangar when Diana paid him a visit. Diana informed Wayne about Darkseid and his Invasion of Earth.

All of a sudden, Bruce's phone buzzed and notified him to locate Barry Allen, so he took the plane to fly to Central City.

Following Diana's history lesson, the two began to talk about Curry's background and Diana speculated he must be Atlantean with mixed blood. Bruce told her that he had refused Bruce's offer. While Bruce worked on tracking down and recruiting Barry Allen, she would work on locating Victor Stone aka the "Cyborg".

Meeting Barry Allen
Bruce sitting in Barry's chair
When Bruce arrived in Central City, he located and broke into Barry Allen's apartment shortly before the latter returns, and introduces himself to the young metahuman (whom he recognizes as the past version of the scarlet time-traveler that appeared in his "dream"), though the latter is still confused. Bruce then promptly hands Barry a printout of the security camera footage he found on the LexCorp Industries files. Barry instantly recognizes himself in the photo and tries, unsuccessfully, to dismiss the person as someone who looks like him, Jewish and someone who drinks milk, claiming that he does not do so himself.

Bruce throwing a batarang at Barry Allen|Barry
Bruce surveys his apartment and tells Barry that he knows the latter has abilities but just needs to know what they are. Barry nervously rambles about his skills, including competitive ice dancing, when Bruce hurls a batarang at Barry as fast as he could, which the latter effortlessly dodged and caught. Barry, awed, deduces that Bruce is the Batman, and dismisses Bruce's assessment of his abilities as an oversimplification.

Bruce witnessed Barry's speed
Bruce then continues, telling him about the team that he is putting together, and almost immediately, Barry wants in. Bruce is momentarily confused, but he gladly accepts his decision. Barry, admiring the batarang, asks if he can keep it.

Barry and Bruce heading to the car
As Barry and Bruce headed to his car, Barry consumed an entire box of pizza and explained the concept of the Speed Force, and how it allows him to consume insane amounts of food. However, when Barry asked Bruce just how many there were on the team, Bruce's response prompted Barry to then ask what exactly Bruce's powers were, to which Bruce told him that his power was that he is rich.

Notified by James Gordon
While the plane landed back in Gotham, Wayne and Barry Allen walked down the stairs and Bruce asked Diana if she found Victor Stone yet; her answer was that she and Stone spoke to each other and told Wayne to give the cyborg some time to come.

Noticing the Bat Signal in the sky, saw it and excitingly reminded Bruce that it meant they should get going, leading to Bruce and Diana sharing a look over the young vigilante's behavior.

Batman meeting with James Gordon
Batman and the Justice League received intel from Commissioner James Gordon that the Parademons are traveling underground. Cyborg, who came so fast to the Bat-Signal, appeared behind the League's backs, reminding them that his father, Silas Stone, is kidnapped by Parademons as well.

Gordon then showed the printed map that is between Gotham and Metropolis which they lead to Stryker's Island and where Gotham Harbor is at.

Batman, along with Wonder Woman and Cyborg, used their vanishing acts when Gordon turns around to ask another question, much to his and Flash's surprises until Flash sped off, too.

Skirmish under Gotham Harbor
Batman vs. Parademons
Steppenwolf then grabs Silas Stone, which Cyborg shot Steppenwolf and saved his father, and Wonder Woman helps out by attacking the Parademons and taking Steppenwolf to a different part of the factory. While Batman fights the Parademons, Barry goes and save one of the employees. Steppenwolf tells the Parademons that he will deal with Diana alone; meanwhile, Batman is being attacked by one of the Parademons, which he struggles against but eventually defeats in hand-to-hand combat. He is then is forced to retreat by several more Parademons, telling Alfred to send theKnightcrawler to him via remote control.

Batman jumping into the Knightcrawler
Flash and Cyborg save all the hostage, which Silas Stone tells Victor that Steppenwolf can not get the final Mother Box. Batman then jumps down into the Knightcrawler and saves Wonder Woman after a Parademon manages to briefly knock her out. The Knightcrawler gets attacked by Steppenwolf, and Barry helps Wonder Woman get her sword so she can help Batman.

Batman saving Wonder Woman from a Parademon
Flash and Wonder Woman gets attacked by Steppenwolf and the Parademons before Batman helps her by killing one of the Parademons. Cyborg then falls into the Knightcrawler and hacks it in his control, which he uses it against Steppenwolf. But the Knightcrawler fails when Steppenwolf caught a missile and threw it against the wall, which then causes the harbor to flood and allows Steppenwolf to escape.

Before Diana could get hit with the flooding water, Arthur comes and saves the team by using the Trident of Poseidon to hold back the water while the League escaped.

Reviving Superman
Arthur talking with Batman and James Gordon
After the fight with Steppenwolf, Batman met with Gordon before Arthur showed up and said that Steppenwolf took the Mother Box from Atlantis, then Victor revealed that he already has the final Mother Box, which he hid from his father. During a team meeting, Bruce concludes that they should use the Mother Box to bring Superman back to life. He believes that they need Superman to restore hope in humanity. Diana and Arthur are hesitant about the idea, but Bruce forms a secret contingency plan.

Batman looking down at the Kryptonian ship
The team put Clark's body in the waters of the Kryptonian ship, using Allen's Speed Force to activate the Box, causing the resurrection of Superman.

Clark attacks Batman
As the League all jump on top of Superman, Barry runs around him, but Superman sees him and attacks him. Batman arrives and gets Clark's attention to stop fighting the League. Superman recognized his former foe, took out Wonder Woman, and attempts to incinerate him with his heat vision, Batman's energy dissipating gauntlets only barely managing to save his life. Before Kal-El could kill Bruce, Lois came to stop him.

Superman calmed down, took Lois with him, and flew away to the Kent farm, where he reflected and tried to recover his memories. In the aftermath of the skirmish, Steppenwolf retrieved the final Mother Box.

Battle of Pozharnov
The Justice League ready to battle Steppenwolf
The Justice League take the Flying Fox to Russia to stop Steppenwolf from being the Mother Boxes together, the team plan how they're going to stop Steppenwolf, Batman tells the team that he going to take out the tower while the rest of the League will separate the Mother Boxes. Batman destroyed the tower, but the controls on the Flying Fox also failed, causing it to crash. Bruce got in the Batmobile and fought off the Parademons sent to stop him.

The Batmobile is attacked by a swarm of Parademons
The Parademons eventually overwhelm the Batmobile, ripping off one of the guns that it has an opening up the car before Wonder Woman and the rest of the League save Batman. Arthur jumps on the Batmobile, approvingly telling Bruce that he is out of his mind before leaping at several Parademons. Shortly afterwards, the Batmobile is destroyed, forcing Batman to eject from the vehicle, using his grapple gun to swing across, and taking out several Parademons.

Batman shooting at the Parademons with one their own weapons
While Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Cyborg enter the reactor to battle Steppenwolf, Batman used the Parademons' own weaponry against them, cutting them down in droves to protect Barry Allen as he worked to build up a charge strong enough for Cyborg to stop the Unity.

However, a Parademon is able to injure the Flash, delaying him long enough for the Unity to complete, killing the heroes, Batman included. However, by using the Speed Force to reverse time to before the Unity was completed, Barry Allen saves the Justice League and gives Cyborg the sufficient charge needed to destroy the Mother Boxes from within, finally separating them with Superman's help.

Following the death of Steppenwolf through the combined efforts of Aquaman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, the battle is over.

A new world
In the aftermath of the battle, Wayne decides to rebuild Wayne Manor as a base of operations for the team as he and Diana agree that more heroes could join.

He also helped Martha Kent get her house back by buying the bank that had taken it as another way of making amends with Clark, who thanked him. As the two were walking away, Bruce congratulated Clark.

Meeting the Martian Manhunter
One morning, sometime after the Justice League defeated Steppenwolf, Bruce would encounter a green-skinned individual who was impressed by their victory. He warned Bruce that the fight was not over yet, and Darkseid would eventually make his way to Earth. Bruce inquired as to who he was, and he notes that he was known by many names, one of which was the Martian Manhunter. He also mentioned was ready to step out and start fighting, now that there were more heroes in the world. Following their little talk, he flew off into the distance.

Knightmare
Darkseid's ultimate victory
In a dark potential future, Lois Lane was killed at the hands of Darkseid. Superman, in his grief, succumbed to the Anti-Life Equation and under Darkseid's orders took over Earth and founded the organization known as the regime to act as a sort of government. The Justice League was effectively destroyed, forcing Batman, the Flash, and a mortally wounded Cyborg into hiding and leading to the apparent demises of Aquaman and Wonder Woman. To aid in Darkseid's totalitarian crusade, Superman founded the regime stormtroopers army, killing anyone who opposed him.

Batman in the ruins of Earth
Now in hiding, Batman and his allies formed the insurgency, a rebellion against the totalitarian regime. They traveled the world searching for allies to join their cause, and while they fought valiantly, their numbers slowly dwindled over the years, and Earth was transformed into an apocalyptic wasteland.

The kryptonite trap
After years of fighting, with only a few contacts left across the globe, an aging Batman, now living an underground bunker, received news that the remaining insurgents found a piece of Kryptonite, a possible last hope of defeating Superman. Filled with newfound hope and strength, Batman ordered the rock be brought to him. Days later, an insurgency convoy approached, which Batman watched from above his bunker.

Batman battles Superman's forces.
Batman met with them and asked for the rock they were tasked to retrieve. However, it turned out to be an ambush and Bruce was held at gunpoint by one of his lieutenants as the undercover regime agents revealed themselves. The remorseful stormtrooper holding Batman at gunpoint apologized, but did not let down his guard as the other Stormtroopers mercilessly executed Batman's insurgents agents as he watched helplessly. Roaring in despair, Batman began a one-man assault on the Stormtroopers. Although he managed to take down most of the troopers, a swarm of parademons invaded the area, abducting many of his resistance fighters. Batman was eventually overwhelmed as the remaining regime troops finally began to restrain him. Relentless in his assault, Batman began dispatching the troopers, breaking limbs and even snapping one of their necks, but then was brutally beaten down and restrained by reinforcements. Seeing the Stormtroopers' inability to restrain him, a parademon knocked him unconscious from behind.

Knightfall
The final insurgents, awaiting Superman
Batman awoke chained up in a bunker with his remaining agents, eyeing them helplessly just before Superman arrived, landing in the bunker as his regime stormtroopers reverently knelt before their general. Approaching Batman, Superman swiftly murdered the last insurgents with his heat vision. Superman then unmasked the vigilante, expressing his anger over Bruce for letting Lois die, as she was his "world." Superman gave him one final sneer, placing his hand flat against his chest, then brutally ended the life of Bruce Wayne by tearing out his heart. Sometime after his death, Superman could be seen floating above the wreckage of the Justice League's headquarters, holding the mask that he had pulled off Batman moments before his presumed death.

Personality
Bruce's true, dark and serious personality.
Bruce Wayne is very determined and dedicated to his work of crime-fighting vigilantism (due to having been forced as a young child to watch his parents get murdered by Joe Chill), sometimes employing illegal and morally dubious tactics (like torture, much to the chagrin of Superman, causing him to initially view the former as a brutal and unforgiving criminal) while fighting crime as Batman, but ultimately for the good of Gotham City. Being skilled in the art of deception, Bruce often hides his true dark (almost sociopathic) personality by maintaining a façade in public - while still serious and intelligent, he purposefully comes off as a somewhat arrogant womanizing playboy (notably trying to brush off reporter Clark Kent in order to flirt with Diana Prince), so as to avoid anyone from suspecting that he could be the fearsome Batman. Bruce's deception also extends itself to his alter ego, since as Batman he strives to fool the criminal underworld of Gotham City into thinking that he is an inhuman and supernatural being, akin to a wraith. Hence, several female sex trafficker victims of Cesar Santos notably mistook Batman for a "Devil", and Cyborg initially even doubted Batman's existence. Alfred Pennyworth, however, notes that Bruce has never been skilled at deceiving him, as he has known Bruce since the latter was a child. Other than Alfred, however, the only other individual known to see through Bruce's genius deceptions is Lex Luthor.

Although possessing great disgust and anger towards criminals and supervillains (most notably the Joker and Harley Quinn after they murdered Robin), Batman, like the other Justice Leaguers, has proven himself a very caring and selfless person, in addition to being incredibly brave, constantly putting his life on the line to save innocent lives and bringing the most dangerous criminals to justice for society's protection. Even as Bruce Wayne, for all his playboy demeanor, he was known to be a generous and kind businessman, often giving donations and performing charity acts through his company, and he could completely shed his playboy façade in the face of great tragedy, as shown when he fearlessly ran straight into the clouds of falling debris in Metropolis and managing to save Wallace Keefe and a little girl, showing compassion towards their conditions when Wallace tearfully realized he was now paralyzed and when the little girl tearfully admitted to now being orphaned and later on giving extensive monthly donation to the victims of the Black Zero Event from his company, showing genuine regret and sadness upon learning that Wallace Keefe had supposedly hatefully rejected and emailed him, unaware it was Lex Luthor who sent the funds back with the hate mail). He also risked his own life to rescue Martha Kent, who he proceeded to reassure was safe at his hands, spared the notorious Deadshot just because his daughter Zoe Lawton was there when he subdued him and left Zoe unharmed. While a situational ally to Amanda Waller and promising to protect her from any compromising rumors about Midway City, Batman is adamantly against her Suicide Squad idea, finding the idea of even criminals immorally leveraged and used as pawns to be disgusting, and threatens to have his Justice League friends shut it down for her unless she does it first.

Batman, as a tremendously skilled and well-rounded vigilante and polymath genius (in tactics, deception, criminology, science, engineering, hacking, business, exploitative networking, and martial arts, as well as both inductive and deductive analysis), has bettered himself both mentally and physically to his peak, without any superhuman assistance, thereby making him capable of pulling off terrific feats without actually being superhuman. Hence, Batman epitomizes many of the humanist beliefs of Lex Luthor, who somewhat admires him, despite being Batman's enemy and business rival, and Lex, therefore, selects Batman to be his (discreetly manipulated) champion against Superman and the metahumans. While his exceptional intellect and extensive experience make Batman wise, they also make him slightly vain, as he notably condescendingly calls the younger Clark Kent "son" upon first meeting the latter, though this might have also been part of his Bruce Wayne playboy façade. Despite being a polymath genius, however, Batman was still in many ways considerably intellectually surpassed by supergenius Lex Luthor, who easily manipulated Batman as a pawn in his grand scheme to destroy Superman.

Batman's strongest characteristic had originally been his strong moral code to never kill (notably not even killing the Joker and Harley Quinn after their murder of Robin), until he became considerably more hardcore in his approach to fighting crime in Gotham City, after witnessing the Black Zero Event first hand. It is believed that a combination of emotional and physical pain, loss, exhaustion, and potential disillusionment he's experienced during his time protecting the streets of Gotham, as well as his growing cynical, pessimistic, and world-weary personality, caused Batman to view his former methods as too lenient (referring to his formerly held belief in their effectiveness as a "beautiful lie"), and to decide that he was better off letting his enemies die than allowing them to return and cause more harm.

Hence, after the Black Zero Event, Batman became more than willing to risk the safety of his enemies, as he has repeatedly crashed and wrecked vehicles with enemies still inside using the Batmobile, as well as using both its guns and the Batwing's to cause explosions near enemies, usually by blowing up nearby vehicles. He has also caused explosions in which enemies were caught in, such as by knocking grenades near enemies, or using a stolen machine gun to ignite Anatoli Knyazev's flamethrower when he was about to kill Martha Kent, causing it to explode and seemingly engulf everyone in the room, though he shielded Martha Kent from the blast with his cape and saved her, as promised. It should be noted, however, that Batman's involvements with the deaths of criminals are more like manslaughter, which are caused by his enemies themselves while trying to hurt him, with him only using lethal force against them in response to them using it against him first. Therefore, Batman never has killed anyone in the eyes of the law. Along with that, he did spare enemies who survived his brutal means of dealing with crime and refused to kill those he captured, showing he still could not let go of his old morals.

In addition to having abandoned his no-kill rule, Bruce tends to be extremely suspicious of others, especially those in possession of great power, since he notably claimed that even if there is only a one percent chance of the alien Superman being a potential enemy of humanity, that it has to be taken "as an absolute certainty", due to the incredible destruction and carnage that the tremendously powerful alien could potentially unleash if he were to become corrupted by evil. This very cynical point of view on Bruce's part comes from him having seen "what promises are worth" many times during his two decades as Batman, having seen many seemingly benevolent individuals become malevolently corrupted, to the point that Bruce claims that hardly any "good guys" are left anymore (making it more than a mere one percent chance of Superman's corruption in his eyes), in addition to the fact that the only other Kryptonians (General Dru-Zod and his loyalists) who arrived on Earth had attempted to wipe out all life on the planet in a terraformation apocalypse. As a result, Batman perceives Kryptonians as having a natural predisposition towards evil, and he, therefore, fears the possibility of General Zod's level of evil gradually developing in the only other member of the latter's race still to be on Earth - Superman (whom Bruce disdainfully refers to as "an alien" in a conversation with Clark Kent). Hence, despite his brilliant intellect and extensive experience, Batman, after 20 years of relentlessly fighting crime in Gotham City, is shown to have become a damaged, fearsome, and almost sociopathic individual. Alfred Pennyworth explained it as fear and rage being able to gradually render a good man like Batman into a cruel one, due to the paradigm shift that the revelation of Superman's existence had brought about. This newly darkened aspect of his personality ultimately allowed Batman to be outsmarted and manipulated, though supergenius Lex Luthor is notably the only one known to have ever successfully done so, due to him being one of the extreme few individuals to surpass Batman in intellect. Lex did so by using Batman's inner rage and demons against him, secretly finding ways to provoke Batman past the point of rational thinking, with Lex claiming that it had been easy to "push [Batman] over" and make him his pawn. When combining his own personal fear of and prejudice towards Superman due to the Black Zero Event, with Wallace Keefe sending him angry notes (actually from Lex Luthor), with Lex making it seem that Superman had blown up the DC Capitol, with Bruce feeling both the need to live up to his father Thomas Wayne (to do something that would actually matter to the whole world) and kinship with his ancestors (the first generation of Waynes, who were hunters, somewhat like him now), along with a horrifying message from a possible potential future (sent by that future's version of the Flash) where Superman ruled Earth as a ruthless tyrannical overlord (along with Flash warning Batman to fear "him", someone Batman had "always been right about", interpreted by Batman to mean Superman), Batman ultimately resolved to take matters into his own hands by pitting himself against Superman in battle, intending to kill the latter before he could potentially become an incredible threat.

In the ensuing ferocious battle, Batman uses every tool in his ungraded arsenal against Superman, from a fierce Armored Batsuit, automated machine guns, sonic emitters and lead smoke grenades, to a spear and gas grenades containing kryptonite, and even a re-purposed kitchen sink. After finally managing to weaken Superman and having him at his mercy, Batman proceeded to brutally (even somewhat sadistically) beat the alien hero, pummeling him with his armored fists, hurling him through concrete pillars, and cutting Superman's cheek with the kryptonite spear, making good on his promise to make Superman "bleed." As he placed his armored foot onto the fallen Superman's throat and prepared to kill him, Batman taunted his enemy, claiming that the alien had never been a God or even a man. However, when Superman uses (what he thinks will be) his dying breath to beg Batman to save his mother Martha Kent rather than beg for his own life, Batman, seeing Superman's lack of care over his incoming death and only that Batman save Martha, is left deeply shocked by seeing Superman's selflessness personally and able to come back to his senses in the nick of time, finally realizing that Superman is in fact a selfless person instead of an monstrous alien threat (concluding that he must have misinterpreted future Flash's message, as it would be utterly impossible for this to be a ruse on Superman's part), with the fact that their mothers share the same name ("Martha") enabling Batman to see Superman as being fundamentally just as human-like himself, despite his alien heritage. Furthermore, Batman saw how hypocritical his actions were, since while he had formerly claimed that Superman needed to be destroyed due to the possibility of him becoming malevolently corrupted, Batman had ultimately become malevolently corrupted himself (just as Alfred had previously pointed out to him), having became the thing he swore to stop, which had made it so easy for Lex Luthor to manipulate him into egregiously killing the son of Martha, much like how the thug Joe Chill had once orphaned Batman himself, the son of another Martha. In addition, Batman's prior belief of Kryptonians having a natural predisposition towards evil was invalidated when he learned of Lex Luthor's hand, as Batman realized that tremendous evil need not necessarily come from an alien, with him having been deceived this whole time by a supervillain considerably more evil than General Zod, one who was a fellow human of his. Angered, ashamed and horrified at the mislead monster that he had almost become, Batman hurled aside the spear in disgust, sincerely apologizes to Alfred for their disagreement, noting he didn't deserve him for what he had almost did, being sincerely grateful at Alfred for still being so forgiving, and atones for his mistakes by risking his life in rescuing Superman's mother, and then teaming up with Superman (and Wonder Woman) to save the world from Lex Luthor's monster Doomsday. The worst damage caused by his indirect and unwilling assistance to Lex soon came into light, however, when Batman was forced to witness, shell-shocked, as Superman selflessly sacrificed himself to kill Doomsday, further proving how wrong he was about Superman, leaving Batman deeply remorseful about being so devastatingly wrong about Superman (whom he had ironically wanted to kill less than 2 hours earlier), whom he acquires a great deal of posthumous respect for.

While guilt-ridden and devastated, feeling personally responsible for Superman's death, (having wasted 2 kryptonite gas grenades during his duel with Superman, while they could have instead been used to help kill Doomsday without Superman's death being necessary), Batman's indomitable will allowed him to not despair over the knowledge of the inevitable invasion of the New Gods, courtesy of Lex Luthor's warning and channels his full determination and efforts to not to fail him in death by bringing together and leading Aquaman, Cyborg, and the Flash, together with Wonder Woman, thus forming the Justice League, which posthumously honors Earth's greatest hero by protecting the now vulnerable world against any formidable threats. In addition, Superman's noble self-sacrifice has inspired and given Batman a more optimistic and hopeful outlook, since he says to Wonder Woman that despite their many flaws, men are still good and that they do in fact have the potential in them to rebuild and improve (the motto of Superman's House of El). Indeed, Batman is now able to see that Superman was "a beacon to the world", one who didn't just save people, but also "made them see the best parts of themselves." This renewed hope in himself and humanity induces Batman to turn away from his former murderous methods, accepting his no-kill rule once again, notably restraining himself from killing even Lex Luthor despite his gleeful taunts and utter lack of remorse over Superman's death, and resolving to base the Justice League on friendship when founding it, unlike Amanda Waller's leverage-based Suicide Squad, with Waller herself calling him out on this. This renewed hope also allows Batman to gain Aquaman's respect and inspire Wonder Woman to become a leader and a better superhero overall. Ultimately, Batman proves himself to be just as selfless and heroic as Superman when he (like Superman did with Doomsday) is willing to sacrifice himself to defeat Steppenwolf and save the world - by distracting an army of Parademons, thereby giving the Justice League a necessary opening to dismantle the Unity, but Wonder Woman decides to save Batman instead.

Batman, while usually very serious, prim, and even somewhat gloomy, is a charismatic mentor and leader, having led his protégé Robin in numerous vigilante escapades and missions, and even being mentally prepared to gather together the Justice League's first roster and lead them against the impending Parademon invasion. When Flash remarks on his inexperience, many fears, and questions his value to the team, Batman helped him gain confidence with some simple advice, deducing the young speedster's potentially good judgment in their battle. Batman even gains the respect and friendship of the usually gruff lone superhero Aquaman. However, Batman is willing to be a strict and blunt leader on occasion, but this is shown to be equally effective in the end - notably when he angers Wonder Woman by using her memory of Steve Trevor to motivate her, but she is ultimately inspired by Batman's words to become a better leader and a better superhero overall. Batman's serious nature also leads to him initially getting annoyed with new Justice League recruits Flash and Aquaman, due to the former's quick-witted humor, and the latter's dry remarks about his Batsuit.

On rare occasions, Batman even demonstrates a dry, dark and sarcastic sense of humor, notably when alone with Alfred, when Lex Luthor (believing himself to be speaking with Anatoli Knyazev) asked him to "break the bad news", Batman responded by saying that "[he]'d rather do the breaking in person", when he claims to Flash that being rich is his superpower, and when remarking Cyborg (who initially doubted his existence) that "[he's] real when it's useful."

Abilities
Bruce dropping over 720 pounds
Peak human condition: Bruce Wayne went through intense training and specialized dieting that represents the pinnacle of human physical prowess, all of which have naturally heightened his abilities to the highest levels of human potential. Some of his regular workout feats are bench pressing, squatting, and performing weighted pull-ups, as well as pulling and dragging heavy plates of an excess of a couple thousand pounds, to name a few. While biologically human, his physical capabilities are all at peak physical perfection resulting in nigh-superhuman physical prowess, far exceeding that of even Olympic-level athletes, making him immensely physically powerful by normal human standards. Even despite his admission that he has somewhat gotten weaker with age, as of now his physical capabilities still far surpass even those of other exceptionally fit humans such as Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and in an alternate timeline where he was somewhat further weaker from being even older, the Regime Stormtroopers, with only Deathstroke being on par. Indeed, by bettering himself to his physical peak, Batman epitomizes many of the humanist beliefs of Lex Luthor, inducing the latter to admire Batman, despite being his enemy.
Peak human strength: Batman's strength allows him to physically overpower combatants, including elite-trained humans and extraterrestrial troops. As he prepared to face Superman, Bruce underwent an extremely intense exercise regimen to increase his strength to an almost superhuman level. Hence, Batman is capable of effortlessly lifting and hurling humans like ragdolls over his head over more than 25 feet across a warehouse, knock out Harley Quinn with a single punch while underwater, send enemies flying several meters with a single punch or kick, kick an assault rifle in half, slam through solid walls and reinforced glass, throw people into walls hard enough to break through them, and effortlessly dislocating limbs with a single twist. He's been shown capable of punching people hard enough to send them headfirst into the floorboards and even smashing through plastered wood and brick walls and floors. His strength also extends to his legs, easily allowing him to jump several meters into the air, over a large crate, while slamming a man into it after lifting them with him, and easily jump an into the air from his Batwing, smashing a steel-framed window with little resistance (many of these feats were achieved when he hadn't even recovered from his fierce duel with Superman which had heavily exhausted him). He could also easily tear apart Firefly's armored suit with his bare hands and destroy the latter's detonator with a single stomp. In his vision of an apocalyptic future (where Batman is somewhat older and weaker), mere swings from his gun launched the Regime Stormtroopers in the air and his kick broke one's leg and knocked him out. Notably, he could still break the neck of a Regime Stormtrooper] with his bare hands in mere seconds, while being restrained, and he could still overpower many Regime Stormtroopers] before being ultimately defeated by their sheer numbers. However, even when Batman was being restrained and forced down simultaneously, he was still able to rise up, only being neutralized by a superhumanly strong blow of a Parademon troop. Even when captured, Batman had to be restrained with very thick and heavy chains. Moreover, when wearing his Armored Batsuit, his peak human strength is augmented by 28 times, reaching considerable superhuman levels, effectively allowing him to exert about 29 tons of force. Indeed, he could easily swing Superman when he was weakened by kryptonite around by the cable of his grapple gun through several stone columns and deliver punishing blows that visibly hurt the weakened Superman, although as Superman recovered his powers, Batman's punches quickly proved to have less effect, as after Superman had partially recovered, though he still managed to temporarily pin him down and land blows that did have sufficient force to turn the superhero's head over and cause him some pain, albeit at that point his blows only irritated Superman, he soon only barely staggered him and was swiftly unable to even faze Superman at all, resulting in him being completely overpowered by the alien and forced to use Kryptonite to weaken him once more.     Batman breaking through a window  
Peak human durability: Batman is also exceptionally durable by human standards due to his intense training. His muscles and bones are vastly denser and far more resilient than an average human. Hence, Batman could not be slowed down or fazed by falling from the rafters of a warehouse, allowing him to quickly land on his feet and begin his assault. This also allowed Batman to be unfazed when smashing through a steel-framed window, feet first, being shot at multiple times, getting kicked and hit by guns in the face, and accidentally colliding with a thick wall head-on at full speed with his grapple gun while trying to evade Doomsday. In his nightmarish vision of a possible future, Batman also remained unfazed after an immense beating at the hands of the Regime Stormtroopers and only gritted his teeth in frustration, with it taking a superhumanly strong blow from a Parademon to knock Batman out. When using his Armored Batsuit, his durability is dramatically enhanced to the point where he was able to survive both light blows and being viciously thrown around by a holding-back Superman without any injuries, although Superman noted even with the armor, killing Batman would still only take minor effort had he actually wanted to kill him. Even without the armored suit, however, he has shown himself to be able to only grunt in discomfort when lifted and roughly pinned against a wall by the superhumanly strong Aquaman and even when thrown several yards by Superman after the latter's revival, he only suffered moderate bruises that he was able to swiftly recover from with some help from Wonder Woman.
Peak human agility:      Bruce running through Metropolis   Batman's athletic prowess grants him exceptional agility, coordination, and balance while fighting and evading others. Batman is incredibly nimble and agile, and has demonstrated high levels of agility and dexterity. He was able to perch on a wall to avoid arriving police officers, followed by quickly moving across ceilings and walls with almost ape-like acrobatics, dodging the point-blank gunfire from a GCPD police officer's shotgun effortlessly, with the officer unable to get a glimpse of Batman, as the Dark Knight's speed and agility made him appear as blurs of motion. His mobility allows him to move away from the sight of others and stalk enemies from the shadows or higher vantage points. Hence, Batman was able to swiftly somersault over a cornered crook with almost inhuman agility. He also managed to remain unscathed while breaking into LexCorp's Metropolis facility, despite the guards trying to shoot him and himself leaving a considerable path of destruction. He also effortlessly brought down Knyazev's 24 men at once using his combat skills and strength, appearing as blurs due to his incredible speed. Also, Batman could jump several meters into the air over a large crate while slamming a man into it (after lifting him into the air with him while he was jumping), easily balance himself while standing on the back of a stone gargoyle, and dodge many Parademon plasma bolts while grappling into their midst. Even while wearing his Armored Batsuit, the heaviest of his suits, Batman was still able to move at considerable speeds, even being able to intercept an attack from the partially recovered and flying Superman and outmaneuver him to pin him to a wall, though against a full-power Superman, he couldn't react to even a single one of the many blows Superman landed on him. He was even able to dodge Doomsday's superhumanly fast charge and his blasts.
Peak human stamina: Batman's highly trained and developed body generates far fewer fatigue toxins than an ordinary human, superior in that regard to the finest Olympian athlete, able to exert himself at his peak capacity for several hours without tiring or slowing down. Hence, Batman was able to easily dispatch 24 armed thugs with intense speed (despite being fatigued from his recent duel with Superman), followed by actively participating in the final battle against Doomsday. He was able to run through the cloud of falling debris during the Black Zero Event, and to routinely perform extremely intense workouts in the Batcave without tiring much. Batman can also recover extremely fast from injuries and fatigue due to his training and indomitable will. However, when pitted against beings of far superior strength (like Superman) in hand-to-hand combat, Batman will increasingly show signs of exertion and fatigue even while wearing his Armored Batsuit.
Peak human metabolism: Batman's metabolism runs several times faster than an average human's due to his strict diet and incredible workout regimen, this allows him to have a near inhuman metabolism, healing, immune system, and longevity. Thus, binge drinking has no effect whatsoever on him, as Bruce's body burns it off several times faster than an average human's, despite him drinking several bottles at a time, to which Alfred dryly remarked that the next generation of the Wayne family will inherit an empty wine cellar.

Peak human strength: Batman's strength allows him to physically overpower combatants, including elite-trained humans and extraterrestrial troops. As he prepared to face Superman, Bruce underwent an extremely intense exercise regimen to increase his strength to an almost superhuman level. Hence, Batman is capable of effortlessly lifting and hurling humans like ragdolls over his head over more than 25 feet across a warehouse, knock out Harley Quinn with a single punch while underwater, send enemies flying several meters with a single punch or kick, kick an assault rifle in half, slam through solid walls and reinforced glass, throw people into walls hard enough to break through them, and effortlessly dislocating limbs with a single twist. He's been shown capable of punching people hard enough to send them headfirst into the floorboards and even smashing through plastered wood and brick walls and floors. His strength also extends to his legs, easily allowing him to jump several meters into the air, over a large crate, while slamming a man into it after lifting them with him, and easily jump an into the air from his Batwing, smashing a steel-framed window with little resistance (many of these feats were achieved when he hadn't even recovered from his fierce duel with Superman which had heavily exhausted him). He could also easily tear apart Firefly's armored suit with his bare hands and destroy the latter's detonator with a single stomp. In his vision of an apocalyptic future (where Batman is somewhat older and weaker), mere swings from his gun launched the Regime Stormtroopers in the air and his kick broke one's leg and knocked him out. Notably, he could still break the neck of a Regime Stormtrooper] with his bare hands in mere seconds, while being restrained, and he could still overpower many Regime Stormtroopers] before being ultimately defeated by their sheer numbers. However, even when Batman was being restrained and forced down simultaneously, he was still able to rise up, only being neutralized by a superhumanly strong blow of a Parademon troop. Even when captured, Batman had to be restrained with very thick and heavy chains. Moreover, when wearing his Armored Batsuit, his peak human strength is augmented by 28 times, reaching considerable superhuman levels, effectively allowing him to exert about 29 tons of force. Indeed, he could easily swing Superman when he was weakened by kryptonite around by the cable of his grapple gun through several stone columns and deliver punishing blows that visibly hurt the weakened Superman, although as Superman recovered his powers, Batman's punches quickly proved to have less effect, as after Superman had partially recovered, though he still managed to temporarily pin him down and land blows that did have sufficient force to turn the superhero's head over and cause him some pain, albeit at that point his blows only irritated Superman, he soon only barely staggered him and was swiftly unable to even faze Superman at all, resulting in him being completely overpowered by the alien and forced to use Kryptonite to weaken him once more.
