<html><p>Diana and Arthur try to keep Steppenwolf away from Cyborg by using the Lasso of Hestia to pull him down. Steppenwolf tries to taunt Diana about how the Amazons fell before Steppenwolf's might, including her mother, but Diana saw through his deception. He attacked them both before he knocks Arthur into a wall breaking the ceiling before Diana saves him. Before Steppenwolf could kill Cyborg, Superman comes and saves him, by easily overpowering the New God and breaking his axe. But even with Superman, the Boom Tube to Apokolips opens with Darkseid at the helm and his army standing by. Flash is severely injured from the Parademons and the Unity synchronizes, to the horror of all. But Flash uses his powers to reverse time and brings the charge to Cyborg, allowing him to link into the Unity and break it apart from the inside. Victor calls Superman for help with the Mother Boxes, allowing them to separate and destroy them. Steppenwolf is not down yet and tries to attack, but is stabbed by Arthur in the back and lifted before Superman punches him. Diana then jumps and slices Steppenwolf's head, the New God's body flying through the Boom Tube to Darkseid where he crushes his head. Diana is then seen with the rest of the Justice League facing Darkseid before the Boom Tube closes.

A new world
After the defeat of Steppenwolf, the League observed the beauty of the small town in Russia and later on, Diana helped Bruce Wayne move forward with plans to expand the League with more at the empty Wayne Manor as their base. Diana also captured art thieves at a museum who are lassoed and she was greeted by kids. At a later point in time, at least one newspaper reported on Wonder Woman denying the rumor that she and Aquaman were supposedly dating.

Knightmare
The remains of the Hall of Justice.
In a dark potential future, Darkseid came to Earth and killed the newly resurrected Superman's lover, Lois Lane, making the distraught Man of Steel susceptible to Darkseid's mind control. Together with his new general Superman, Darkseid conquered the planet and transformed it into an apocalyptic wasteland. A massive conflict began between Darkseid and Superman's Regime and the Batman and the Justice League's Insurgency. At some point later the Amazons built a funeral pyre for her body, with her mother among those grievously mourning her death even as Darkseid and his forces descended upon Themyscira. Sometime later, her shield could be seen lying cracked in the ruins of the Hall of Justice, the potential headquarters of the Justice League.

Personality
Diana is a very kind, loving, compassionate, and strong-willed person, who, while initially somewhat naïve, has become all the wiser through her time in Man's World. An outspoken egalitarian, she fights for what she believes in and generally for the betterment of mankind through love and mutual understanding, as taught to her by her mother and fellow Amazons. Growing up, Diana also proved herself headstrong and determined to do what she wanted, such as training in hand-to-hand combat under her aunt Antiope's tutelage despite her mother initially forbidding it. In this way she is quite stubborn; if she believes something is the right thing to do, then she will do it - as evidenced by her attempt to leave Themyscira without her mother's permission and insistence in attending Ludendorff's gala despite Steve telling her not to. Alongside her kindness and compassion, however, Diana was also a very naïve idealist when she first arrived in "Man's World," blindly believing that all men were corrupted by Ares and that the World War I Central Powers would simply abandon their sinister ways if she killed him. This blind naivety also translated to explicit indignation whenever she was treated with disrespect due to her status as a woman, such as when she was ignored by members of the War Office. Alongside this, Diana also voiced her opinions rather bluntly upon her arrival, such as when she perceived Etta Candy's job as Steve Trevor's secretary to be akin to slavery (which earns Diana Etta's admiration). Despite her outspokenness and behavior in Man's World, however, Diana remained very caring and compassionate, as demonstrated by her initially rocky relationship with Charlie and willingness to step into No Man's Land to save the village of Veld while encouraging him with compassion to sing for them 

By the end of the war, Diana began to lose faith in both humanity and herself after Ares opened her eyes to humanity's potential for evil. While she still believed in the power of love and compassion to change humanity for the better despite their flaws because of Steve’s declaration of love to her that showed her that, Diana was left sobered and emotionally broken over certain events from the war, such as the use of Dr. Poison's gas to massacre the entire village of Veld, and Steve Trevor's self-sacrificing death however she was inspired by his love & selfless act that shows her that humanity is indeed worth protecting despite their imperfections so she vows to do because she is unable to fully stop caring for and protecting humanity by keeping innocent people safe as a mysterious female savior while also continued to fight and kill other malicious beings from other worlds and did everything in her power to prevent Max Lord's apocalyptic agenda. In spite of her sophisticated line of work, Diana was clearly an introvert at heart with few friends. This did not mean she was closed off from human connection, however, as she and Barbara Maxwell bonded rather quickly. When she saw what the power of the wishing relic was almost ready to do to the entire world, she made the ultimate sacrifice by heavyheartedly revoking her wish to be reunited with Trevor — ironically, the Amazonian who had still had belief in humanity despite their imperfections was the very first to revoke her wish, having done so purely out of selflessness. Upon witnessing the destruction of the seemingly unstoppable Doomsday, Diana joined to battle him alongside Batman and Superman. After witnessing Superman's sacrifice to stop the monster, and after Bruce's appeal to her underlying belief in the inherent good of humanity even though she understands the complexities of human nature because humanity is both good and bad by sending her the original photograph of her and the Wonder Men & sends Bruce a thankful email of him bringing him back Steve Trevor even if she accepted the truth that Steve is gone thirty yrs ago since she can’t have it all even though he’s a memory to Diana so she’s inspired to come out of the shadows demonstrating despite how much humanity had failed or she understands that humanity is flawed but worth protecting despite being a mysterious female savior over the yrs, she still held underlying belief in her own core values and the positive effect true heroes can have on the world. 

While living in "Man's World" for a century following World War I tempered some of Diana's more blindly held beliefs, she still held true to her core values of kindness and compassion, and further grew into an exceptionally considerate, diplomatic, and empathetic woman. fully understanding the complexities of human nature. This can be seen when she silently emphasizes with Lois Lane after the death of Superman had been killed (recalling her own pain with Steve Trevor) smiling knowingly when Aquaman accidentally sat on the Lasso of Hestia and confessed his fears about their upcoming mission and how attractive he found her. With all of her experiences, Diana is also the most diplomatic member of the Justice League, as evidenced by her treatment of the Flash with compassion and patience, despite his tendency to somewhat annoy her and the other Justice Leaguers with his humorous attitude, and the kindness and support she showed to Cyborg while he continued to grapple with his powers. Indeed, through her compassion and unbreakable spirit, Diana has given renewed hope to many of her teammates throughout the years. For example, she motivated and inspired the Wonder Men into looking past purely monetary interests, with Chief resolving to no longer be neutral in the war, Sameer finally admitting his passion for acting, and even the depressed Charlie struggling with PTSD finally beginning to sing again for the first time in years. Likewise, during the Justice League's battle against Steppenwolf's forces, Wonder Woman was able to inspire confidence in the inexperienced Flash and Cyborg, assuring them that they wouldn't need to fight the Apokoliptan invasion alone. Furthermore, she was the most understanding of Superman's confusion upon his resurrection and remained ambivalent about fighting the newly-resurrected Superman and even implored him not to force her to, showing him compassion and persistence while attempting to get him to remember who he is (even calling him by his birth name). In addition to her general willingness for empathy, however, Diana is also extremely friendly and can step back enjoy the smaller moments in life, as seen in her utter delight in experiencing ice cream and agreement with Superman (who, up until this point she had not spoken to much) about him not missing out on the positive results of their victory over Steppenwolf.

Even alongside all of her kindness, compassion, and empathy, Diana is still also a warrior at heart, and when someone she cares about is hurt, becomes far more relentless and ruthless. When seemingly beaten by Ares (who was only growing more powerful from her violence, rage, and hatred), and after having to watch her beloved Steve Trevor die, she flew into an agonizing rage, and she assaulted and brutalized several armed German soldiers with immense speed and ferocity. She even came close to murdering Doctor Poison as vengeance for Steve's death; but after recalling Steve's great love for an undying belief in her and her beliefs, restrained herself and refocused her energies on Ares, harnessing her love for Trevor to overcome her violent emotions and swiftly overpower an angered Ares. Additionally, she resolved to fight even harder after Steppenwolf revealed that he had killed several other Amazons. Outside of battle, however, Diana can also react indigently and negatively towards people who disrespect her, her relatives, or those she cares about. Two such notable instances were when she shot an angry look at Lex Luthor (after he insulted her father Zeus's memory), and when she furiously shoved Batman back (after he had insulted her beloved Steve Trevor's memory). Diana also remains ruthless when facing enemies in battle as Wonder Woman, and she even shows signs of enjoying a good battle when they put up a good fight. This was seen when she briefly smiled and laughed when she was beaten to the ground by Doomsday, and smirked as she stopped the first bullet fired at a group of hostages in London. 

Still, Diana ultimately had a very strong regard for life and compassion for her enemies, choosing not to drown Cheetah or wish Max Lord out of existence, knowing that ending the conflict without committing murder would be far more difficult. Additionally, she only killed Ares and made more than one attempt on the life of Steppenwolf because it was clear to her that both of them were sentient beings of pure malevolence with no genuine love for anybody.

Perhaps due to her Amazon background, Diana greatly respects other noble selfless warriors, as evidenced when she attended Superman's funeral in Smallville and spoke of how he had been much more than a soldier (adding to what Batman said about Metropolis burying an empty casket). As a result of her great posthumous respect, she was, therefore, more than willing to aid Batman in honoring the heroic death of Superman, by helping round up the metahumans from Lex Luthor's files to form a team of superheroes (later known as the Justice League) to protect the world from the imminent mysterious alien invader Steppenwolf and his Parademon minions after Superman's death left the world vulnerable.

In addition, Diana appears to hold members of her close family in high esteem. In addition to the respect she has for her mother, Hippolyta, and aunt Antiope, she indicated that she held her father Zeus in the same very high esteem, when she was visibly angered when Lex Luthor referred to him distastefully while discussing the story of the Titan Prometheus.

Powers and abilities
Powers
Amazon-Olympian hybrid physiology: As the hybrid offspring of an Amazon and an Old God, Wonder Woman possesses incredible superhuman physical abilities, such as an inhuman strength, durability, speed, agility, stamina, reflexes and healing, as well as extended longevity, the ability to generate divine energy through her bracelets, manipulate electricity in a limited way, and cast spells. Wonder Woman's power is great enough to kill a full Old God like Ares and contend with much stronger beings like Doomsday. As such, Wonder Woman is the second most powerful member of the Justice League, second only to Superman.

Superhuman strength:    Wonder Woman lifting a tank   As a demigoddess, Wonder Woman possesses incredible superhuman strength, making her the second strongest member of the Justice League, only surpassed by Superman. She can effortlessly bend metal bars, slam through solid walls and reinforced glass, and pry open steel doors. Even before accessing her full divine powers, Wonder Woman was strong enough to dominate several Amazons during her training, knocking down one with a whip and another with a shield, as well as kicking Antiope's sword out of her hand. Wonder Woman's strength extends to her ability to leap great distances. In a bar fight, she was able to throw a man across a room with an effortless shove of her hand. She effortlessly lifted an adult man with one arm and held him in the air, threw an armored Ehrhardt E-V/4 tank in the air with ease, effortlessly knock down many German soldiers with her shield and lasso, and deflect a missile with her shield. Diana's immense strength allowed her to fight Ares, the powerful God of War, despite the considerable divine power of her older brother, managing to grab him from the waist and throw him against the roof of a warehouse. However, she was still easily dominated by the much stronger Ares. After obtaining and releasing her true divine power, Wonder Woman was able to fight Ares to an even greater degree, managing to knock him down and hit him in the face twice, as well as defeat a small German battalion using only her strength, and raise a very large and heavy German tank without much effort, which weighed 29 tons. In 1984, during the rescue at the mall, Diana was able to break two revolver with her hands, lift a grown man with one hand, and lift the three robbers and then drop them on top of a police car. She was able to move a truck out of the way to protect herself from bullets, make another truck fly through the air by putting her back on the ground to generate a pothole, and with a kick move a tank out of the way, as well as avoid for a time that two trucks would crush her, putting her feet like a lever. She was also able to stay in combat for quite some time with  Barbara, despite the fact that at that point she had almost completely lost her powers, almost like holding down several grown men that Barabara was throwing into the air with the help of her lasso. After regaining her powers, Diana was able to outmaneuver Cheetah in combat, even though the "apex predator" had initially taken the lead, as well as holding Cheetah down long enough to keep her from electrocution, and knock her unconscious. Diana also face the powerful Kryptonian deformity known as Doomsday, with her blows being powerful enough for the monster to wobble, stopping a massive blow of the monster with her sword. She was even able to knock him down with one strike of her shield on one of Doomsday's legs, as well as cut a car thrown toward her by Doomsday in half. Wonder Woman was also able to fight several times against the powerful Steppenwolf, managing to take him from the waist, knock him down through a wall, and shove him against a concrete wall. She was able to stab her sword into one of the feet of the New God, cut him at the waist, and, with the help of Aquaman, knock him down before he reached Cyborg. Wonder Woman was also able to break Steppenwolf's Electro Axe with her sword after Superman froze it with his freezing breath. In addition, during the Resurrection of Superman, Wonder Woman was the only one in the Justice League who was actually able to harm and defend against Superman during his confusion, though only briefly and to a minor extent, slightly pushing him back with a blow from her shield, forcing him to exert himself slightly to resist and break free of her lasso and managing to briefly keep herself from being pulled to Superman, and even generating a powerful shockwave and blowing Superman back slightly with a single headbutt, which visibly impressed the latter and making him put more effort to ultimately overpower her. The only beings that surpass the strength of Wonder Woman are Ares, Doomsday, Steppenwolf, Darkseid and Superman.
Super leaps: Wonder Woman is able to use her incredible strength to jump immense vertical and horizontal distances, with her leaping across an entire field effortlessly, while fighting Doomsday.

Super leaps: Wonder Woman is able to use her incredible strength to jump immense vertical and horizontal distances, with her leaping across an entire field effortlessly, while fighting Doomsday.
Superhuman durability: Wonder Woman's skin, bones, and muscles are much denser and harder than those of humans and Amazons, which makes her incredibly durable. Although she is not bulletproof and is susceptible to piercing attacks, she can survive blunt force trauma, falls from high altitudes, explosions and powerful energy blasts, and withstand blows from superhuman opponents such as Ares, Doomsday, Steppenwolf and Superman. While training with the other Amazons, Wonder Woman was not affected by the attacks of the latter, not even by the attacks of strong Amazons like Antiope and Artemis, as well as by resisting the blows of the improved Erich Ludendorff without any damage. Wonder Woman's durability allowed her to withstand Ares's blows, despite the considerably greater strength of the God of War, as well as a direct hit from a sword built by Ares, an explosion of lightning that blew it away and left her somewhat dazed, and even a tremendous explosion that left her dazed and almost deaf for a few minutes and still was able to get up to fight again against her half brother. In 1984, despite losing most of her powers, Diana was still able to survive being struck and thrown through concrete walls and pillars by Barbara, as well as falling into the street from a great height with two children in arms. After regaining her powers, Diana was able to withstand severe electrocution much more than Cheetah, who was knocked unconscious, as well as resist being thrown against a wall by the great winds generated by Maxwell Lord's wishes. Diana also withstand the huge blows of the Doomsday, with a blow sending her flying several meters and leaving her completely unharmed. She was also able to withstand the lightning, thermal vision and waves of electrical discharges of Doomsday, wrapped by the thick thermal beam without suffering any damage. In the same way, Wonder Woman came out completely unscathed and without a scratch from her fierce battles with Steppenwolf and Superman, even though Steppenwolf hit her constantly with his axe and Superman hit her with enough force to leave her dazed. While Wonder Woman may be affected by the considerable force of the powerful impacts, they only make her stumble and hit her briefly, leaving her unharmed, with Wonder Woman smiling even after receiving powerful blow from Doomsday that sent her flying, and quickly rose up to face the monster again with a renewed ferocity.
Regenerative healing factor: Due to her hybrid physiology, Wonder Woman can heal from wounds at considerable superhuman rates. This compensates for her vulnerability to sharp objects and bullets. During the Germans' attack on Themyscira during World War I, Diana suffered a wound to her shoulder that, even with much of her power being suppressed had healed completely a few hours later. In 1984, having regained her powers after giving up her wish, Diana was able to recover from the injuries and trauma, which Cheetah had inflicted on her during their confrontation, in a matter of seconds.
Poison immunity: Wonder Woman was able to walk right through a cloud of Dr. Poison's extra lethal hydrogen-based mustard gas without suffocating, and with little to no discomfort.

Poison immunity: Wonder Woman was able to walk right through a cloud of Dr. Poison's extra lethal hydrogen-based mustard gas without suffocating, and with little to no discomfort.
Superhuman speed: Wonder Woman can move at superhuman speeds. She was able to make it from the Metropolis Airport to Gotham Port in minutes after seeing Doomsday on television. She was fast enough to get up from her seat, disarm a man of his gun, and toss him across a room in seconds; to leave Lex Luthor's fundraiser before Bruce managed to reach her; to save Batman from Doomsday's thermal attack; and to instantly use the Sword of Athena to slice apart in mid-air a car that Doomsday hurled at her. Indeed, Wonder Woman appeared as a blur when charging back at Doomsday after being knocked back by him. In 1984, despite the gradual loss of her powers, Diana was still able to run alongside several high-speed trucks and tanks, as well as react fast enough to save several civilians who Cheetah was throwing to the air. Although outmatched by Superman and the Flash, Wonder Woman was still fast enough to be capable of providing some resistance to their respective immense superhuman speeds, as she was able to move herself enough to outstretch her hand while Flash was super speeding towards her instead of being totally frozen to him and managed to quickly cover the distance between her and Superman to surprise and land a hit on him and later on dealt a powerful headbutt while her Bracelets were restrained by the Kryptonian.
Superhuman reflexes: Wonder Woman's speed also extends to her reflexes, even if she is not moving at super speed. She was able to perceive bullets as if it were moving in slow motion. She repeatedly used this skill to deflect bullets with her Bracelets of Submission and block the blows of her opponents with ease. One hundred years later, Wonder Woman's reflexes improve further, to the point that she was able to block all of the full auto assault rifle shots of a British terrorist with her bracelets, leaving the people standing behind her unscathed. When she dropped her sword mid-battle with Parademons, Wonder Woman was able to perceive Flash super speeding towards her fallen weapon, and hence outstretched her hand while he returned the sword to her grasp. Her reflexes were not powerful enough to contend with those of Flash or resurrected Superman, however, as Superman managed to grasp Wonder Woman's Bracelets of Submission before she could clash them.

Her reflexes were not powerful enough to contend with those of Flash or resurrected Superman, however, as Superman managed to grasp Wonder Woman's Bracelets of Submission before she could clash them.
Superhuman agility: Wonder Woman naturally possesses superhuman agility, dexterity, balance and body coordination, allowing her to jump up immense distances and come down in elaborate somersaults, to swiftly and easily take down many World War I soldiers, while dodging and weaving around their attacks, and to even dodge quite a few attacks from the equally fast Ares, Cheetah and Doomsday. Diana is also able to mix her great agility with the use of her lasso, allowing her to glide with great skill and then jump over obstacles with the help of her lasso. This was demonstrated during her rescue at the mall in 1984.
Superhuman stamina: Wonder Woman's advanced musculature is considerably more efficient than that of a human and most of the other Amazons. As a result, her muscles virtually do not produce fatigue toxins during physical activity compared to humans and most other members of her race. Her virtually inexhaustible endurance allows her to exercise her maximum capacity for an indefinite period of time without tiring at all, as she never needs to slow down or catch her breath during her fierce battles with Ares, Cheetah, Doomsday, Steppenwolf and the resurrected Superman, despite being pressured considerably by all of them.
Superhuman senses: Wonder Woman's senses are superhumanly enhanced, much like those of Superman. She was able to clearly see Steve Trevor from miles away when his plane crash-landed near Themyscira.
Immortality: Like all Amazons, Diana has lived for millennia without visibly aging, with her being roughly 5,000 years old (having been born right after the War of the Gods), and having been present in the "Man's World" since World War I. She is thus the oldest member of the Justice League by far (though still roughly a millennia younger than Enchantress, and even more so than Ares and Steppenwolf), making her an ageless immortal, much like Superman.
Divine energy generation:     Diana uses her divine power   As the daughter of Zeus, Wonder Woman has incredible control over the supernatural divine energy of the Old Gods, which she usually emits through her Bracelets of Submission. When she clashes her bracelets together, she releases a large spherical blast of orange (or sometimes white-hot) energy, with it being powerful enough to accidentally injure Antiope, send the mighty gods Ares and Steppenwolf flying back, and even push back the gigantic monster Doomsday. At full power, Wonder Woman could generate these shock waves from her body, notably to destroy the restrains Ares put her in and knock down a small German battalion with a very powerful omni-directional shock wave. She was also capable of using the energy to shield herself, as the debris Ares sent flying at her disintegrated against the invisible field as she built up her attack. She could also freeze the momentum of targets in front of her, causing Ares to be forcibly suspending in the air when he tried flying into her before she blasted him away. Wonder Woman can also transmit this energy through her shield. By striking one of her bracelets with her shield, she generated an energy wave that knocked down a bridge, and Cyborg and Steppenwolf with it.
Diana uses her divine power
Magic manipulation: Diana is capable of manipulating magic based on what she remembers of the ways of the Old Gods.
Shrouding spell: Mimicking her father's shroud spell over Themyscira, Diana was able to teach herself to generate an arcane veil that could be placed around objects, making them imperceptible even to the gods. She uses this ability to hide a F-11 Aardvark, enabling them to make their escape.

Lightning channeling: Wonder Woman, as the demigoddess daughter of Zeus, has some degree of power over divine lightning. When Ares shot bolts of lightning at her, she caught, absorbed, and then redirected the tremendous bolts back at the God of War, killing him. She can also interact with lightning without being electrocuted, such as when she swung from lightning bolts and withstood electrocution while battling the Cheetah.
Flight: Wonder Woman possesses the ability to defy gravity and fly. While battling Ares, she leapt into the air and gravitated down once, and then hovered for a few seconds just as she ended her battle with the war god. After regaining her powers by giving up her wish of the Dreamstone, Diana first learned how to fly by riding air currents (advice she remembered from Steve Trevor). Unfamiliar with this new skill, she used her lasso once to propel herself faster, but gradually became more comfortable with flight therefore no longer needing the lasso to propel her. She flew at hyper-sonic speed to help people in need on the ground in 1984.
Abilities
Wonder Woman fighting German soldiers
Master combatant: Wonder Woman, having been trained in combat tactics by Menalippe and Antiope, is a tremendously skilled, fierce, and formidable hand-to-hand combatant (being at least on par with Batman), . She is a master of a vast array of unique Amazon martial arts, as well as an expert in most types of melee weapons (though she most frequently uses her bracelets, lasso, sword, and even shield). She has centuries of combat experience, with her claiming to have fought and defeated several beings from "other worlds" (which includes even the fearsome God of War Ares himself). Her fighting style includes Taekwondo, Capoeira, Muay Thai and Greek wrestling combined with her skills with swords, archery and throwing . Wonder Woman swiftly became the greatest warrior of Themyscira, her tremendous combat skills eventually becoming enough to rival even those of her mentor Antiope and ultimately surpassing her upon acquiring full potential, due to the latter (upon Hippolyta's insistence) training her much harder than any Amazon ever before her. Hence, Wonder Woman defeated many World War I soldiers (she defeated and killed even the enhanced General Ludendorff relatively quickly), and numerous Parademons single-handedly, seamlessly incorporating hand-to-hand combat, sword-fighting with the God Killer (and later with the Sword of Athena), and the Lasso of Hestia in her own personalized, formidable style. Indeed, Wonder Woman's tremendous skill and exceptionally versatile style make her capable of effectively holding her own against either more experienced or more powerful opponents, even the mighty God of War Ares (albeit only with considerable effort and initial failure, given his superior combat experience, and her need to use a non-violent mindset), even with her sword having been destroyed by the more powerful Old God, the New God Steppenwolf, an enraged resurrected Superman, (being the only one in the Justice League who was actually able to land any meaningful hits on the Kryptonian and making him fight with more effort, though she was ultimately swiftly defeated by the amnesiac Superman and only saved by Lois Lane's timely intervention), and the gigantic Doomsday, with her managing to temporarily knock the latter fearsome monster down (by smashing his feet from under him with her shield), and even temporarily restrain him with her Lasso of Hestia, as well as cut off his right arm with the Sword of Athena. Indeed, had Doomsday not had his incredibly adaptable healing factor, it is safe to assume that Wonder Woman's tremendous combat skills would have allowed her to ultimately defeat him. Moreover, even when Wonder Woman's sword was destroyed by Ares, she still held her own against the more powerful Old God.
Sword mastery: Wonder Woman is an extremely skilled swordswoman, with centuries of experience wielding her magical God Killer sword (and later the Sword of Athena) in many battles, including those of World War I. Thus, she managed to slash at enemy soldiers with her sword even while racing past on horseback, to instantly slice apart in mid-air a car hurled at her by Doomsday with the Sword of Athena, to later do the same to massive piece of debris hurled at her by resurrected Superman, and to sever one of Doomsday's arms during her battle with the monster, delivering wounds that would have otherwise been lethal, had it not been for the monster's incredible healing factor and adaptive evolution.
Lasso mastery: Wonder Woman is extremely skilled at wielding her unbreakable Lasso of Hestia both offensively and defensively, notably using it to stop an escaping German spy, to take down numerous German soldiers in World War I battles, to retrain a British terrorist leader, to restrain and defeat General Ludendorff, to hold her own against Ares after getting her sword destroyed, to restrain a resurrected Superman (albeit unsuccessfully), and to even restrain Doomsday himself. Diana is precise enough with her lasso to catch a bullet and redirect it, as seen in 1984.
Expert archer: Wonder Woman, despite hardly ever using a bow and arrows in combat, is nonetheless highly trained in utilizing them, having received elite archery training from her aunt Antiope.

Expert archer: Wonder Woman, despite hardly ever using a bow and arrows in combat, is nonetheless highly trained in utilizing them, having received elite archery training from her aunt Antiope.
Stealth mastery: Wonder Woman is exceptionally stealthy, as she was able to quickly sneak away from Chief and Charlie to General Ludendorff's gala, and later to steal the hacking device that Bruce Wayne had plugged into the LexCorp Industries servers and leave it in his car, without getting caught on either occasion. Later, Wonder Woman noticed Cyborg spying on her and Batman from a distance. Shortly thereafter, along with Batman and Cyborg, she was able to swiftly slip away when Commissioner Gordon turned away for a moment, and even Flash was left incredulous at how he didn't notice his teammates leave, despite having superhuman reflexes and standing right beside them. Wonder Woman even managed to enter the highly-secure Batcave itself on her own, impressing Batman.
Genius-level intellect: Wonder Woman is extremely intelligent, wise, well-read, perceptive, and sophisticated, primarily due to her tremendously long immortal lifespan, natural fluency in all human languages (even dead ones, like Latin, Ancient Greek, Sumerian, and Ottoman Turkish), her having read many books even while still on Themyscira, and her century of living in "Man's World" after World War I, all of which makes Wonder Woman the wisest and most emotionally intelligent member of the Justice League, despite her having initially been naïve, headstrong, and idealistic at the time of leaving Themyscira with Steve Trevor. As such, Wonder Woman has no issues blending in with the high-class society of "Man's World." She held her own while verbally sparring with Batman (with the extremely experienced vigilante having trouble discerning her identity), was the first to realize that Doomsday's adaptive healing factor was energy-based, and was the only one on supergenius Lex Luthor's metahuman list to figure out that Lex was keeping tabs on her and had obtained a compromising photo of her with Steve Trevor (possibly due to her having been once been fooled by another deceitful supervillain, Ares). She also displays a keen understanding of technology and biomechatronics, shown when Wonder Woman uses the Batcomputer, remarks on Cyborg's Mother Box enhancements, and when she deduced that resurrecting Superman with a Mother Box might produce a monster like Doomsday. Wonder Woman's intellectual genius extends itself to her combat, perceptiveness, stealth, arcane lore, and antiquities dealing skills.
Expert antiquities dealer:     Diana, speaking to a Gotham curator.  Wonder Woman, while in her guise as the human Diana Prince, is an extremely experienced genius antiquities dealer, with Diana's immortal life and natural fluency in all human languages allowing her to accumulate an immense amount of knowledge on the subject, though (being an Amazon with Old God heritage) she seems to specialize most in ancient Greco-Roman antiques. Hence, Diana works as Curator for the Department of Antiquities at the extremely prestigious Louvre Museum in France, and she is held in very high esteem by the curator of the Gotham City Museum of Antiquities. She was swiftly able to tell that the museum's exhibit of Alexander the Great's sword was a fake, knowing exactly where the actual sword was and impressing Batman himself.
Arcane lore expert: Wonder Woman possesses vast amount of knowledge and skill in wielding mystical artifacts and arcane lore, notably her Sword of Athena and Lasso of Hestia. Her encyclopedic knowledge was demonstrated when Wonder Woman reacted in dismay to Lex Luthor's speech (knowing how he had twisted the Old Gods' history concerning Zeus and Prometheus), when she instantly identified a Parademon in Commissioner Gordon's sketch, and when she explained the history behind Steppenwolf and the 3 Mother Boxes to the remainder of the Justice League.
Expert social intuit: Diana has a high degree of social confidence (having had a century of experience living in "Man's World" after World War I), allowing her to intuitively determine how to interact with others, gain their respect and get her point across with calmness, eloquence, and charisma. Hence, Diana swiftly befriended the Wonder Men, she diplomatically greeted Bruce Wayne, matter-of-factly showing him that she can intellectually keep up with him (calmly responding to Bruce's anger at having been stolen from by her), she tactfully accepted a wine glass from the Gotham City Museum of Antiquities curator (despite seemingly disliking alcoholic beverages), she tactfully avoided correcting the curator on his claim that the fake replica of Alexander the Great's sword was the actual relic, and only when Lex Luthor insulted her father Zeus' memory did Diana have a look of visible dismay on her face (but even then she avoided making a scene), and only when Batman insulted her beloved Steve Trevor's memory did she finally lose her temper and shove Batman back. As a result, Diana remains extremely well-respected at the Louvre Museum, by fellow antique museum curators, by the Justice League, and even the extremely experienced Batman is almost instantly intrigued by her.
Expert equestrian: Wonder Woman is an accomplished horseback rider, shown during her involvement in World War I battles.
Omnilingualism: Like all Amazons, Wonder Woman has the ability to fluently speak, read, and understand all human languages (including dead ones, which allows her to surpass even a polyglot like Sameer), as well as to instinctively identify a language's name when seeing its written form (doing so when seeing Dr. Poison's notes on hydrogen-based mustard gas). Wonder Woman has so far been known to speak or read English (albeit with a mild Middle Eastern accent), French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Mandarin, Chinese, Sumerian, Ancient Greek, Ottoman Turkish, Blackfoot, Latin, and Arabic, thus making her the most polyglottic member of the Justice League.
Expert antiquities dealer:     Diana, speaking to a Gotham curator.  Wonder Woman, while in her guise as the human Diana Prince, is an extremely experienced genius antiquities dealer, with Diana's immortal life and natural fluency in all human languages allowing her to accumulate an immense amount of knowledge on the subject, though (being an Amazon with Old God heritage) she seems to specialize most in ancient Greco-Roman antiques. Hence, Diana works as Curator for the Department of Antiquities at the extremely prestigious Louvre Museum in France, and she is held in very high esteem by the curator of the Gotham City Museum of Antiquities. She was swiftly able to tell that the museum's exhibit of Alexander the Great's sword was a fake, knowing exactly where the actual sword was and impressing Batman himself.

Indomitable will: Wonder Woman has tremendous determination and strength of will. She refuses to ever give up, even when placed against seemingly insurmountable odds. Hence, despite the Germans invading Themyscira having far superior firepower, despite the extreme danger of German firepower in-between World War I trenches, despite having to fight the stronger and seemingly unstoppable Doomsday, despite having to battle the mighty Ares right after witnessing Steve Trevor's death, Wonder Woman promptly rose up, overcame her negative emotions, and kept on fighting, persisting until she eventually managed to gain the upper hand. Indeed, her indomitable spirit gave a renewed hope to the Wonder Men and inspired them past the point of purely monetary interests, with Chief resolving to no longer be neutral in the war and believing her story of the Old Gods, Sameer finally admitting his passion for acting, and even the depressed Charlie struggling with PTSD finally beginning to sing again for the first time in years. When humanity's inherent potential for evil was revealed to her by Ares, Wonder Woman, while initially taken aback, ultimately rejected the prospect of alliance with Ares against them, even if that were to mean missing out on "paradise" on Earth, and instead courageously confronted him as the god killer. When seemingly beaten by Ares (who was only growing more powerful from her violence, rage, and hatred) and overcome by the weight of his words and the devastation of Steve's death, Wonder Woman recalled his great love for and undying belief in her, and was thereby able to muster enough willpower and love to overcome her violent emotions and defeat Ares. While mostly stepping away from superheroism for 100 years (emotionally crippled at her inability to save the Belgian villagers and Steve, and by seeing the ensuing "century of horrors"), Wonder Woman didn't entirely lose hope, and it was fully reignited again when she witnessed the self-sacrificing death of another selfless superhero, Superman (who combined the phenomenal godly might of Ares with the self-sacrificing morality of Steve Trevor), giving her enough faith to help Batman found the Justice League. During the League's battle against Steppenwolf's forces, Wonder Woman was able to inspire confidence into the inexperienced Flash and Cyborg, assuring them that they wouldn't need to fight the Apokoliptan invasion alone.
Equipment
Weapons
Lasso of Hestia: Wonder Woman's completely indestructible weapon, with the ability to force anyone it captures to obey the lasso's wielder and tell the truth. She successfully wielded it against Steve Trevor (in order to get the experienced spy to tell her the truth), General Ludendorff (in order to prevent his escape and kill him), Ares (in order to keep up with the violent God of War in battle), Doomsday (in order to temporarily restrain him, while Batman weakened him, and Superman delivered the finishing blow), and the resurrected Superman (in order to restrain him until the post-mortem amnesia wore off).
Wonder Woman's Bracelets of Submission.
Bracelets of Submission: Like all Amazons, Wonder Woman wears two nigh-indestructible gauntlets as part of her armor. They are incredibly durable, capable of deflecting even Ares' massive bolts of lightning and Doomsday's tremendously powerful and destructive thermal attack. Due to her powers as a demigoddess, she also has the ability to create a massive wave of energy outwards when she clashes them together.
God Killer: Wonder Woman's extremely sharp and durable sword forged in Themyscira that she wielded in battle during World War I, which Hippolyta claimed to be capable of killing Ares. However, the God Killer was ultimately destroyed by Ares.
Amazon shield: During World War I, Wonder Woman used an Amazon shield that she used to protect herself from bullets and other attacks when she entered no man's land. However, Wonder Woman lost the shield during the battles and several years later replaced it with a new one.</p></html>
