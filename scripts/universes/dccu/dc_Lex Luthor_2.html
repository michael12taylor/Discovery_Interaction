<html><p>Hence overall, Lex Luthor is extremely unpredictable, as he often has numerous back-up plans to his back-up plans, accounting for numerous possible scenarios with efficient contingencies. Indeed, Lex's unparalleled ability to plan, strategize, restrategize, and break down his opponents grants him power that surpasses even that of Superman and metahumans, since Lex's ability to predict and gather information on his many opponents allows him to easily outstrategize any of them one-on-one, thereby making it almost impossible for them to succeed against Lex. As a result, Lex caught both Batman and Superman off-guard with the revelation of his endgame - Doomsday. Even Lex's personal assistant, confidant, and right-hand woman Mercy Graves, who knew him best, was ultimately not privy to all of Lex's master plans, and therefore was unable to correctly predict his future actions.   

Much like his archenemy Superman, Lex has tremendous determination and strength of will, since he absolutely refuses to ever hunker down and give up, even when placed against seemingly insurmountable odds, with Lex mastering almost any situation with his numerous tactical contingencies, and even going so far as to claim that he doesn't know how to lose. Indeed, Lex even resolves to dominate in something as trivial as a bowling game with Ron Troupe. Hence, Lex managed to successfully transform his father's company, LexCorp Industries, from a petrochemical and heavy machinery dinosaur into a cutting-edge Fortune 500 technology giant (in a stupendous, what some call a superhuman, business feat), and being willing to use illegal operations to maintain the success of his oligarchical business empire. Later, despite the seemingly impossible task of bringing down the godlike Superman without having metahuman powers himself, Lex refuses to back down from it, and resolves to utilize his phenomenal intellect to devise complex and intricate plans to bring down his archenemy, along with back-up plans, and back-up plans to his back-up plans, for good measure, with Lex ultimately succeeding in defeating and killing Superman and preventing the Knightmare with his personal Frankensteinian creation Doomsday. 

Lex carries out this self-righteous plan with cold calculation and ruthless cruelty, being quick to murder anyone who gets in his way, such as the militantly oppositional Senator Finch, his guilt-ridden pawn Kahina Ziri, his unsuspecting pawns Jimmy Olsen and Cesar Santos, his no longer useful pawns Senator Barrows and Wallace Keefe (along with the 66 other attendees of Superman's hearing), Amajagh's Nairomian soldiers, and even his own loyal assistant Mercy Graves is likewise shown to be disposable to Lex, as she is likewise killed off along with them. Lex even goes so far as to sadistically threaten to burn the kidnapped Martha Kent alive unless Superman "bows to [his] will" by killing Batman. This meticulous and brilliant plan behind Lex's ultimatum was to expose the theological problem of evil in Superman regardless of the fight's outcome - if Superman were to win and kill Batman (to save his mother's life) he would prove to be supremely powerful yet not supremely good, and if Superman were to lose (due to holding back and his weakness to kryptonite) to Batman and die, he would prove to be supremely good yet not supremely powerful. 

In the meantime, Lex continues to better himself and accordingly gain more power, being quick to order the Fortress of Solitude to teach him all about the knowledge from 100,000 alien worlds, thereby expanding his already brilliant mind to supergenius level, finally becoming even more godlike in his own eyes. Despite the failure of his initial grand plan, Lex's far more grand and extreme contingency plan of unleashing Doomsday succeeds, with Superman seemingly being killed by the bloodthirsty monster. Indeed, Lex appears to be so satisfied with his success (as he claims not to know how to lose), that he cares little about being imprisoned for his numerous illegal deeds shortly thereafter, and gleefully awaits the imminent arrival of Darkseid.

Lex also has a somewhat dry, black, and sadistic sense of humor (similar to that of the Joker and General Ludendorff), and love for both witty puns and visual metaphors, shown when Lex mockingly imitated a Kentucky accent when speaking with Senator Finch; when Lex told the wheelchair-bound Wallace Keefe that he wanted to help the latter "stand" for something; when Lex claims that the shortest road to Superman is "Lois lane"; when Lex mentions "civilizations of the wane, manners out the window" to Batman (subtly revealing that he knows of Bruce Wayne being the Dark Knight's alter ego); when Lex had a jar of urine placed upon Senator Finch's desk, labelled "Granny's Peach Tea" (illustrating an epithet that she herself had used against him not along ago) before coldly murdering her with a hidden bomb; and when Lex described the upcoming battles between Superman and Batman, and later Superman and Doomsday with dramatic and sadistic glee, mockingly incorporating antique and theological metaphors (such as describing the first battle as the "greatest gladiator match in the history of the world"). In addition, Lex seems to be well-versed in American pop-culture, making quite a few references from it as well, notably "The Midnight Ride," "Alice in Wonderland," "Lolita" and the "Wizard of Oz." Following his incarceration in Belle Reve and the shaving of his head, Lex retained his sadism, but also paired it with a far more confident, cold and calculating attitude than before, in contrast to his previous darkly humorous persona.

Abilities
Genius-Level Intellect: Lex Luthor is a supergenius of phenomenally outstanding, wunderkind level intellect (famous for being a polymath and bibliophile with the highest level of mastery over numerous eclectic fields, making numerous eclectic references), quite possibly the most intelligent human being in the world, with his phenomenally eclectic intellect virtually unrivaled, with Lex standing out even among other geniuses (notably intellectually outclassing even a genius polymath like Batman, whom Lex outsmarted with ease, and with Lex referring to even the exceptionally smart and insightful Lois Lane as having a "little mind" compared to his) with his ability to master nearly any situation, usually against staggering odds, which makes the virtually peerless ambitious supergenius a worthy opponent even for Superman himself (despite his lack of metahuman powers), being as intelligent as Superman is powerful and far more intelligent than the latter despite Clark's own prolific intelligence inherited from his father Jor-El, the greatest scientific mind in all of Krypton, making him more than able to gain the upper hand over the superhero and eventually kill him. Hence, Lex was notably not deceived by Batman's inhuman and supernatural fa√ßade (being quick to deduce via CCTV that the Dark Knight is actually only a mere man without any metahuman powers) and Flash's momentum negation mirage (still capturing footage of the speedster's powers by accessing the pharmacy's security cameras), and was able to easily outsmart and keep tabs on not only Batman, but also Aquaman, the Flash, Cyborg, and Wonder Woman simultaneously (despite all of those metahumans, as Lex dubs them, attempting to maintain their secret identities with discreet power usage), with only Wonder Woman eventually figuring that out (due to having been tricked before by another deceitful supervillain, Ares), but even she did so too late, and was unable to figure it out fully. In addition, after entering the Fortress of Solitude, Lex orders to be taught the vast amounts of knowledge that the starship's archive had from 100,000 alien worlds, with apparent success. As such, Lex's already phenomenal intelligence became much greater than ever, effectively a supergenius, and he now has obtained tremendous amounts of knowledge regarding extraterrestrial beings, including that of the imminent threat posed by the New God invader Steppenwolf, coming to Earth (due to the Old Gods' and Superman's deaths having left the planet vulnerable), which Lex proclaims to Batman with glee. Lex's tremendously eclectic intellect extends itself to his unparalleled leadership, tactical, strategic, demagogic, deceptive, manipulative, detective, mathematical, scientific, engineering, computer science, computer programming, cryptographic, robotics, hacking, escapology, criminology, genetics, neuroscience, political science, literary, mythological, theological, exploitative networking, and oligarchical business skills, in addition to his phenomenal idiosyncratic wordplay skills with witty puns and malapropisms (allowing Lex to subtly reveal things he is aware of, with people only realizing it when he intends them to).
Master Tactician: Lex Luthor, as a megalomaniac, is a phenomenally formidable tactical and strategic supergenius, to the point that he claims not to know how to lose. Given his lack of metahuman powers, Lex, much like Batman, often uses cunning and planning to successfully outwit stronger and more powerful foes, gaining leverage over them rather than simply out-fighting them, often using any of their exploitable weaknesses (such as kryptonite, Lois Lane, and Martha Kent in the case of Superman and manipulation-inducing tunnel vision in the case of Batman) to his advantage. Indeed, Lex's approach is shown to even far more effective, intricate, complex and ruthless than Batman's, with Lex always having back-up plans to his back-up plans, accounting for numerous possible scenarios with efficient contingencies, making him extraordinarily versatile and unpredictable to the point that his unparalleled ability to plan, strategize, restrategize, and break down his opponents grants him power that surpasses even that of Superman and metahumans, since Lex's ability to predict and gather information on his many opponents allows him to easily outstrategize any of them one-on-one, thereby making it almost impossible for them to succeed against Lex, with Lex almost always being flawlessly successful in the long-term (claiming not to know how to lose). Hence, even after his initial plan of having Senator Finch publicly support his kryptonite "silver bullet" deterrent against Superman (which would have forced the godlike alien to be subjugated and forced to answer to the deterrent-wielding government) fails, Lex is unfazed, and sets a grander contingency plan into motion by changing tactics - learning everything about both Batman and Superman. This allows Lex to successfully manipulate not only Superman into killing Batman (by having Cesar Santos murdered in jail, sending Clark photos of Santos' corpse, and finally, by kidnapping Clark's mother), but also to successfully outsmart and manipulate even the extremely experienced tactical genius Batman (with Lex notably even claiming that this was an easy feat for him) into killing Superman (by sending Bruce notes with provoking "red note" messages "from" Wallace Keefe about the death of his employees in the Black Zero Event, allowing Bruce to steal his data on kryptonite and metahumans, and later, to steal the kryptonite itself), without Batman ever suspecting it until after his duel with Superman was over. This meticulous and brilliant plan behind Lex's ultimatum was to expose the theological problem of evil in Superman regardless of the fight's outcome - if Superman were to win and kill Batman (to save his mother's life) he would prove to be supremely powerful yet not supremely good, and if Superman were to lose (due to holding back and his weakness to kryptonite) to Batman and die, he would prove to be supremely good yet not supremely powerful. And even when Lex's grand contingency plan of pitting both superheroes against each other ultimately fails (and that being only due to Superman saying Martha's name just in time to stop Batman's killing blow), a once again unfazed Lex reveals his far more grand and extreme second contingency plan (by promptly unleashing the mighty monster Doomsday), a plan that ultimately succeeds in carrying out Lex's goal of killing Superman, leaving Lex victorious. Furthermore, when Batman unexpectedly has Lex transferred from Belle Reve supermax to Arkham Asylum, Lex is yet again mostly unfazed, due to him having adapted a contingency plan for a break-out (and subsequent retreat to a contingency private yacht) at the optimal time. Even after Superman is resurrected from the dead more powerful than before and cements together the Justice League, Lex is as confident as ever in face of this greater challenge, and chooses this as the optimal time to escape Arkham, retreating to the contingency yacht, and meeting up with Deathstroke to discuss founding "a league of [his] own" as a contingency against the Justice League.
Master Deceiver:      Lex, convincingly feigning insanity.  Lex Luthor is phenomenally skilled in deception, outclassing even deceptive genius Batman himself in that regard, as he was, notably able to successfully hide his extremism under a kindly and altruistic fa√ßade, which was convincing enough to initially fool Wallace Keefe, Senator Barrows, the extremely perceptive Senator Finch, the insightful and brilliant reporters Superman and Lois Lane, and even the extremely experienced tactical and detective genius Batman, with none of them initially suspecting him to be hellbent on ending the Man of Steel. In addition, Lex deceived Amajagh and the entire CIA (by having Anatoli Knyazev and his men discreetly infiltrate the Nairomian warlord's ranks and incriminate Superman in the resulting bloodshed), was able to deceive the entire US Senate and general public (by having his discreetly hired manipulatee Kahina Ziri read the memorized deceitful script that Lex had written for her, while addressing the Senate and a live news reporter), was able to masterfully deceive Wallace Keefe into siding with him (by bribing him with a high-tech wheelchair and convincing him that he is a useful asset for Lex in changing the world's perception of Superman, while in fact he was a mere disposable pawn), was able to superbly deceive Wonder Woman, Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg (by successfully keeping discreet tabs on them without their knowledge, with only Wonder Woman figuring it out, but only when it was too late), was able to deceive the Fortress of Solitude's entrance into allowing him to pass (by posing as General Zod, using the fingerprints previously sliced off the latter's corpse), was able to mostly deceive the brilliant reporter Lois Lane (by leaving behind so few loose ends, that she was only able to identify him as the main supercriminal culprit behind Superman's framing after receiving some assistance from Jenet Klyburn and Secretary of Defense Swanwick, and even then she was unable to uncover his entire endgame, until it was too late), was able to masterfully deceive Superman into perceiving Batman as a threat and into angrily confronting the latter (by having Cesar Santos murdered in jail, and anonymously sending Clark photos of Santos' corpse), was able to superbly and easily deceive even the extremely experienced Batman himself into becoming his champion against Superman (by sending Bruce notes with provoking "red note" messages with "from" Wallace Keefe about the death of his employees in the Black Zero Event, by allowing Bruce to steal his data on kryptonite and metahumans, and later, by allowing him to steal the kryptonite itself, thereby convincing him that he genuinely, of his own accord, wished to kill Superman, while in fact he was a mere discreetly manipulated pawn), and was able to deceive even his personal assistant Mercy Graves, who knew him best, into getting killed (by having her attend Superman's hearing and convincing her that she is his right-hand woman and confidant, privy to all of his master plans, while in fact even she was a mere disposable liability). Lex's phenomenal deception supergenius was even effective following his imprisonment in Belle Reve supermax, as Lex very convincingly feigned insanity, thereby making himself unfit to stand trial for his numerous unspeakable crimes.
Master Manipulator: Lex Luthor is a terrifyingly accomplished manipulator, perhaps even rivaling the infamous Joker in this regard, as he was capable of steadily, with remarkable ease, turning Superman and Batman against one another by orchestrating several events capable of swiftly inciting their rage, with this ability also aiding Lex in gaining the many criminal allies that help him maintain the success of his oligarchical business empire.
Master Detective: Lex Luthor, although applying this talent for malicious purposes, has proven himself to be an extraordinarily masterful detective, with him masterfully employing multiple extremely well-concealed means such as planting cctvs in arenas of interest as well as hacking to swiftly deduce the truth, notably being able to effortlessly see through Batman's nearly inhuman fa√ßade regarding him being supernatural, deducing correctly that the latter was actually a mere man without any metahuman powers, in addition to Lex accurately discerning that Batman, despite his continued heroism, has in fact been emotionally darkened and embittered over all that he had witnessed in his many years of fighting crime in Gotham City, which Lex very masterfully used to his own advantage to easily get him to take action against Superman. Indeed, Lex's outstanding detective prowess enabled him to swiftly become one of the extreme few individuals to know not only Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and Flash's secret identities (the first one to know the secret identities of the entire future Justice League), but also the first to learn practically everything about both Batman and Superman (notably their powers, abilities, physical and emotional weaknesses, relationships, and psychological profiles), which allowed Lex to discreetly outwit, manipulate, and gain the upper hand against both superheroes with ease.
Master Escapologist: Lex Luthor, to a level that could easily put him on par with, if not superior to, Joker, is exceptionally skilled at escaping unscathed in highly unlikely situations, with him notably somehow escaping from a straight-jacket in Arkham Asylum (covertly leaving another bald inmate in his place), and from the asylum itself without anyone noticing until it was too late, and despite Batman having promised to keep constant surveillance on Lex, with Lex having enough of a head-start to comfortably retreat to a private yacht.
Master Demagogue:      Lex, having delivered his demagogic anti-Superman pitch.  Lex Luthor is a superbly skilled demagogic supergenius (more so than even Batman or Amanda Waller and comparable to Ares), as his intention is to come off as an altruistic humanist of and for the people (with Lex comparing himself to the enlightening gift-giving figure of Prometheus), so he therefore masterfully appeals to popular desires and prejudices when addressing people, often championing the cause of the common (non-metahuman) people, with his usage of seemingly rational arguments making Lex's method even more effective. Indeed, his LexCorp Industries mission statement is: "Let's build a better tomorrow today," while the specified one for Lex/Os is: "Help us build a more human system." Lex's most notable demagogic demonstrations were when he both spearheaded prolific philanthropic efforts to rebuild Metropolis and stressed that recognizing the importance of the "ordinary" non-metahuman heroes of the city (such as the countless citizens who also helped save others during the Black Zero Event) had become more important than ever in light of Superman's debut (all of which inspired Kord Industries and other corporations to follow his example, and even made many people think of Lex Luthor as being as much a hero to Metropolis as Superman himself), when Lex easily manipulates Senator Barrows into giving high-level clearance (to both the Fortress of Solitude and General Zod's corpse) without the latter even uttering verbal consent, and when Lex attempts to manipulate Senator Finch into utilizing kryptonite as a deterrent against Superman (by attempting to appeal to a fear of merely having to depend upon "the kindness" of Superman, who could potentially become a "monster"). It should be noted that Lex failed only with Finch, and only because the latter had been both a long-term adamant supporter of Superman and exceptionally perceptive. When openly discussing his motives with fellow supervillains, Lex is no less eloquent and persuasive.
Master Social Intuit: Lex Luthor, as a very outspoken humanist, has an incredible degree of social confidence and mastery in intuitively determining how to interact with others, gain their respect and get his point across with a calmness, eloquence, and charisma that belie his actual emotional state. Hence, Lex diplomatically greeted Clark Kent (despite his incredible misotheistic hatred for the latter and plot to get him killed) and Bruce Wayne (despite Batman being his enemy and business rival) upon first meeting them, remaining friendly even in the face of their wariness of him, diplomatically stated his hopes and ambitions in an interview with Ron Troupe (casually remaining unfazed by the latter's somewhat provocative questions), quickly appealed to the bitter Wallace Keefe, ignoring the latter's initial vulgar insults (despite merely desiring to use him as a disposable pawn), effortlessly maintained his diplomatic poise when being bombarded by a crowd of reporters (despite their several attempts to provoke Lex and get a rise out of him) to which Mercy Graves would commend him for having "handled it perfectly" (with Lex notably even claiming to her that there was "nothing to handle"), and cordially greeted Senators Finch and Barrows upon first meeting them and eloquently addressed them in his demagogic anti-Superman pitch (despite purely wanting to exploit them to facilitate his own machinations and the mere idea of the alien superhero being sufficient enough to enrage him) to the point that Senator Barrows became visibly intrigued by Lex and even stayed behind, intent to continue a further discussion and come to a mutual agreement with him. Even in the only two known instances when Lex makes a slight social blunder (by temporarily going into a rage when faced with Senator Finch's dissaproval, and later on being unable to improvise a captivating fundraiser speech on the spot), (the former being due to the suddenness of the Senator's disapproval surprising Lex and the latter being due to sadistic glee at all the pieces of his grand plan finally beginning to fall together), despite his feelings of dismay at both occasions, having nearly contradicted his own ideology with a paradoxical statement in the second occasion, Lex swiftly regains control of the awkward and tense situation by casually, even if tauntingly and antagonistically, leveling with Finch despite being faced with the fact that she knew his illegal actions and fixing the minor mistakes he made with his fundraiser speech with only a few words and in a matter of moments before politely excusing himself from the stage, which completely covered up his mistake and earned applause from his guests. Only when finally confronted by Superman does Lex not hold himself back in conversation for the first time, passionately expressing his immense misotheistic hatred for the alien superhero, and everything the latter represents to him. As a result, Lex remains extremely well-respected not only by his LexCorp Industries employees (especially Mercy Graves) and criminal allies, but (right up until Lois Lane exposes his supervillainous actions) even by most politicians and the general public. Following his incarceration in Belle Reve and the shaving of his head, Lex retained his social confidence and wit, remaining as effective as ever even when paired with a far more confident, cold and calculating attitude, in contrast to his previous darkly humorous persona, thus diplomatically welcoming the somewhat aloof and irascible Deathstroke aboard his private yacht, politely offering the latter a beverage while ignoring his initially cold and distasteful remarks, instead proceeding to calmly appeal to the assassin with an interesting proposition, thus managing to successfully and swiftly capture Deathstroke's undivided attention.
Master Word-Player: Lex Luthor, as a megalomaniac, is phenomenally skilled with wordplay to the point that he has the idiosyncratic ability to reveal things that he is aware of so subtly that even the most intelligent individuals could only realize what he means if he wants them to, with Lex being able to openly and smugly flaunt his knowledge to their faces while hiding the true meanings so well so as to make even people as perceptive as Batman and Senator Finch ignorant, with Lex employing witty, occasionally transpositional, puns, malapropisms, discreet black humor, and layered pop-culture references.
Master Mathematician: Lex Luthor is a phenomenally skilled supergenius mathematician being able to pick up on patterns almost all others do not notice, having a penchant to make even something as casual as sports scores sound like algebraic integers, and being able to casually tie mathematical references into conversations while remaining relevant, such as with Euclid's triangle inequality in relation to Lois Lane and Superman.
Master Scientist:      Lex, in his science attire.  Lex Luthor is an extraordinarily brilliant supergenius scientist, phenomenally skilled and knowledgeable in a vast array of scientific fields (including physics, chemistry, biology, genetics, neuroscience, computer science, psychology, and many others), even more so after absorbing new knowledge from the Fortress of Solitude's Kryptonian archives (of 100,000 alien worlds), which allowed him to correctly postulate the "Metahuman Thesis," to discover and re-purpose kryptonite as one of the few things capable of harming the Kryptonian Superman, to reverse-engineer an extremely futuristic and advanced Kryptonian Genesis Chamber from the one in the Fortress, and then successfully modify the alien corpse of General Zod into the monstrous Doomsday with his own blood, and to understand the extremely powerful and futuristic Mother Boxes' function without actually observing them (subsequently making many detailed coded notes about them and the Unity, which even Batman and Alfred proved incapable of understanding).
Master Engineer: Lex Luthor is a phenomenally brilliant and prolific supergenius engineer, computer scientist, computer programmer, cryptographer and robotics technician, a wunderkind prodigy as a child, even more so after absorbing new knowledge from the Fortress of Solitude's Kryptonian archives (of 100,000 alien worlds), since his company, LexCorp Industries is the world's premiere one in high-technology defense innovation (far surpassing Wayne Enterprises, Kord Industries, Stagg Industries, Queen Industries, and Gesch√§ft-Krieg), specializing in new disruptive technologies, notably creating the revolutionary new operating system Lex/OS (the world's first neural network-based operating system), the innovative alloy bullets he provided Anatoli Knyazev with, and the high-tech lead-encased wheelchair he provided Wallace Keefe with, which allowed the bomb inside it to remain undetected even to Superman, and also able to fully understand how to utilize extremely futuristic and sophisticated Kryptonian technology (centuries more advanced than that of Earth), and even managing to successfully integrate it with his own LexCorp technology and scientific apparatus before starting the procedure of reverse-engineering the Genesis Chamber and creating Doomsday.
Master Hacker: Lex Luthor, as a prolific computer scientist and programmer, is an immensely formidable supergenius hacker, cryptographer and cybercriminal, notable for his phenomenal skills of intelligence gathering, and data interpretation, his ability to hack into most computer systems without tripping any firewalls or security, as well as his superb pattern recognition and analysis skills, with Lex therefore being able to pick up on patterns others do not notice. Hence, Lex was able to easily hack into several Gotham City CCTVs (successfully catching shots of Batman in action, despite the latter's immense stealth skills), into a Central City pharmacy's security camera (successfully catching shots of the Flash's supersonic speed), into several high-clearance NSA UUV drones in the Pacific Ocean (successfully recording Aquaman, despite the Atlantean's attempts to destroy the drones with his trident, and avoid them, with his tremendous swimming speed), into the CIA database (learning of the CIA's intention to have Jimmy Olsen infiltrate Amajagh's Nairomian forces via Lois Lane's credentials), into the highly classified S.T.A.R. Labs video log of Dr. Silas Stone (successfully capturing footage of Cyborg's enhancement by a top-secret Apokoliptan Mother Box), and also into high-clearance government facial recognition software (successfully managing to determine that the Amazon demigoddess Wonder Woman from an old World War I photo with Steve Trevor's team, is in fact still alive as the Louvre Museum antiquities curator "Diana Prince," and also learning the secret identities of both Batman and Superman). Hence, Lex swiftly becomes one of the extreme few individuals to know not only Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and Flash's secret identities (the first one to know the secret identities of the entire future Justice League), but also the first to learn practically everything about both Batman and Superman (notably their powers, abilities, physical and emotional weaknesses, relationships, and psychological profiles), which allowed Lex to discreetly outwit, manipulate, and gain the upper hand against both superheroes with ease.
Master Cryptographer: Lex Luthor is a phenomenally skilled cryptographer supergenius, since despite being so excited upon learning about the Mother Boxes and their Unity that he would write multiple detailed notes about them, he coded his writings so efficiently that even the extremely experienced Batman and Alfred were completely unable to decipher them until learning additional Mother Box lore from Wonder Woman.
Master Businessman: Lex Luthor is a phenomenally brilliant, supergenius oligarchical businessman, a wunderkind prodigy, easily the best currently alive in the world, managing to successfully transform his father's company, LexCorp Industries, from a petrochemical and heavy machinery dinosaur into a cutting-edge Fortune 500 technology giant (in a stupendous, what some call a superhuman, business feat), allowing the company to grow to massive heights and gain numerous business partners (notably quickly absorbing Hanford Technologies), which gives him a tremendous amount of oligarchical influence and respect in the business world, in addition to Lex being able to considerably expand the already massive wealth inherited by him from his father to phenomenal levels that makes him quite possibly the wealthiest man in the world ($ 2 billion), to the point where his company easily surpasses even the likes of Bruce Wayne's company, Wayne Enterprises ($97 million), along with Kord Industries's $707 million, Stagg Industries's ($628 million, Queen Industries's ($210 million), and Gesch√§ft-Krieg's $171 million in terms of wealth, R&D budget and in the field of military defense contracts, making LexCorp the world's premiere company in high-technology defense innovation and the largest tech conglomerate in the world. In fact, the astonishingly prolific genius accomplishments of Lex far surpassed even the genius business achievements of his father Alexander Luthor Sr. (which were very considerable in their own right). Unlike Bruce Wayne however, Lex is not above and is extremely skilled in secretly using ruthless cutthroat tactics, unethical practices and illegal operations (with his ties to criminal underworlds) to maintain the success of his oligarchical business empire, fooling all about his usage of dirty ethics. Indeed, Perry White feared that if threatened by Lois Lane through the press, Lex could sue the Daily Planet "out of existence" with his tremendous funds.
Master Leader: Lex Luthor is a phenomenally skilled and brilliantly talented leader, a wunderkind prodigy, having been able to spearhead LexCorp Industries with consistently tremendous effectiveness that eventually led to it being the most prominent company in the world, having the most amount of contracts even compared to the also extremely illustrious Wayne Enterprises, Kord Industries, Stagg Industries, Queen Industries and Gesch√§ft-Krieg, and inspire complete loyalty in both his criminal allies and company employees to the point that they were more than willing to risk themselves against not only the law but also individuals as powerful as Batman and Superman and lead them from the shadows completely unnoticed while efficiently coordinating their efforts to perform anonymous acts. After breaking out of Arkham Asylum, Lex is confident in his ability to bring together and lead "a league of [his] own" against Superman and the Justice League.
Master Literarian: Lex Luthor, as a famous bibliophile, has an encyclopedic knowledge of literary works, possessing vast quantities of books in his own private study, with him being particularly well-versed in American pop-culture, notably hosting a fundraiser for the Metropolis Public Library, his knowledge of the works of the library being acknowledged to the point of being famously recognized as a true friend of said library, and making numerous layered references to various books in conversation, including "The Midnight Ride," "Alice in Wonderland," "Lolita" and the "Wizard of Oz."
Master Theologian and Mythologist: Lex Luthor, despite being a militant misotheist, has an encyclopedic knowledge of both pagan (particularly Egyptian and Greco-Roman) and biblical creeds, myths, and theology, as he is able to fully understand how metahumans are the basis of many pagan myths (with Enchantress and Incubus notably inspiring the pagan myths of the ancient Pre-Columbian Maya and Incas), and he is also proficient in implementing allusions to major figures of those theologies, which he has consistently proven to have a penchant for, having compared himself to Prometheus and even the biblical God in one way, claiming to hate "the sin, not the sinner," and plays God by creating the monster Doomsday, General Zod to Icarus, commenting that the latter flew too close to the sun, and Superman to Zeus, Horus, Apollo, Jehovah, and Satan, in the face of his god-like powers. In addition to making these allusions, Lex is also able to convincingly cast these theologies' supreme gods in a not very discreet negative light (masterfully finding the right myths for that, as he did with Zeus' punishment of Prometheus), to the point that his incorporation of the latter's myth was praised by his guests and even made the usually calm Wonder Woman visibly enraged by Lex's description of Zeus and the Old Gods.
Master Political Scientist:      Lex, bribing Senator Barrows.  Lex Luthor, as an oligarchical supergenius businessman, has a phenomenal understanding of political science, such as the inner workings and intended goals of both political structures and intelligence agencies - notably the US government (whose Senate Lex easily deceived and manipulated), ARGUS (fully understanding the motives and structure of Amanda Waller's Suicide Squad pitch to the Pentagon ), and the CIA (whose covert Nairomian operation, with Jimmy Olsen, Lex easily thwarted without detection). Hence, Lex fully understood the paradigm shift that the goals of modern politics took after the emergence of Superman and metahumans, with him masterfully using this to his own benefit, by openly addressing the newfound political concerns in a demagogic speech when meeting Senators Finch and Barrows, and then effortlessly manipulating Barrows into granting him high-clearance. Indeed, Ron Troupe would go so far as to say that Lex's ideology of humanism makes the latter sound like someone running for political office.
Master Networker: Lex Luthor, as a supergenius manipulator, deceiver, and oligarch, uses a vastly dense network of professional and social contacts to further both his business and supervillain ambitions with outstanding skill. This is notable through his influence of prominent politicians (like Senator Barrows), other supervillains (like Deathstroke), other powerful companies (like Kord Industries), powerful intelligence agencies (like ARGUS, the CIA, FBI, and NSA), and formidable criminal underworlds (like Anatoli Knyazev and his men), as well as his many covert moles and pawns in various places (like Teri, Wallace Keefe, Cesar Santos, Jimmy Olsen, Kahina Ziri, Mercy Graves, and Batman) that do Lex's benevolent bidding for him, sometimes unknowingly. Hence, Lex is able to discreetly keep tabs on numerous people and things that interest him, was able to illegally smuggle in a kryptonite nugget into the United States of America (to a LexCorp facility), and have Blackgate Penitentiary inmates murder Cesar Santos in prison, without any of it getting tied to Lex. Indeed, even when imprisoned in Belle Reve supermax, and later Arkham Asylum, Lex remains confident in his vast network and indeed he managed to orchestrate his escape from Arkham Asylum by having one of his associates replace him and then quickly contact Deathstroke, offering him some extremely expensive Go√ªt de Diamants.
Master Criminologist: Lex Luthor, quite ironically, is a phenomenally skilled and knowledgeable criminologist, outclassing even Batman himself in that regard, since he was able to quickly gain tremendous insight into and understanding of Gotham City's criminals and their mindsets that rivaled, if not, surpassed that of Batman only a while after becoming interested in their activities to research more on Batman, easily understanding how Batman consistently overpowers and undermines their operations. Hence, Lex was able to keep his own supercriminal status covert so superbly that even Batman had no knowledge of it, despite having knew of his shady alliance with Anatoli Knyazev, until learning it from Superman, was able to maintain such strong ties to the criminal underworld so as to successfully use said connections to maintain the extraordinary success of his oligarchical business empire and was able to easily orchestrate multiple criminal acts without having any of it tied back to Lex, such as the death of Cesar Santos in Blackgate Penitentiary at the hands of the latter's fellow inmates.
Eidetic Memory: Lex Luthor, as a supergenius, has a photographic memory and perfect recall, which greatly aided him in mastering a vast array of eclectic fields to the highest level as a polymath, while also allowing him to make numerous layered references (to pop-culture, to biblical and pagan theology, to mathematics, to computer science, to famous books, and etc.), and to know seemingly random facts, such as the scores of recent basketball games.
Master Tactician: Lex Luthor, as a megalomaniac, is a phenomenally formidable tactical and strategic supergenius, to the point that he claims not to know how to lose. Given his lack of metahuman powers, Lex, much like Batman, often uses cunning and planning to successfully outwit stronger and more powerful foes, gaining leverage over them rather than simply out-fighting them, often using any of their exploitable weaknesses (such as kryptonite, Lois Lane, and Martha Kent in the case of Superman and manipulation-inducing tunnel vision in the case of Batman) to his advantage. Indeed, Lex's approach is shown to even far more effective, intricate, complex and ruthless than Batman's, with Lex always having back-up plans to his back-up plans, accounting for numerous possible scenarios with efficient contingencies, making him extraordinarily versatile and unpredictable to the point that his unparalleled ability to plan, strategize, restrategize, and break down his opponents grants him power that surpasses even that of Superman and metahumans, since Lex's ability to predict and gather information on his many opponents allows him to easily outstrategize any of them one-on-one, thereby making it almost impossible for them to succeed against Lex, with Lex almost always being flawlessly successful in the long-term (claiming not to know how to lose). Hence, even after his initial plan of having Senator Finch publicly support his kryptonite "silver bullet" deterrent against Superman (which would have forced the godlike alien to be subjugated and forced to answer to the deterrent-wielding government) fails, Lex is unfazed, and sets a grander contingency plan into motion by changing tactics - learning everything about both Batman and Superman. This allows Lex to successfully manipulate not only Superman into killing Batman (by having Cesar Santos murdered in jail, sending Clark photos of Santos' corpse, and finally, by kidnapping Clark's mother), but also to successfully outsmart and manipulate even the extremely experienced tactical genius Batman (with Lex notably even claiming that this was an easy feat for him) into killing Superman (by sending Bruce notes with provoking "red note" messages "from" Wallace Keefe about the death of his employees in the Black Zero Event, allowing Bruce to steal his data on kryptonite and metahumans, and later, to steal the kryptonite itself), without Batman ever suspecting it until after his duel with Superman was over. This meticulous and brilliant plan behind Lex's ultimatum was to expose the theological problem of evil in Superman regardless of the fight's outcome - if Superman were to win and kill Batman (to save his mother's life) he would prove to be supremely powerful yet not supremely good, and if Superman were to lose (due to holding back and his weakness to kryptonite) to Batman and die, he would prove to be supremely good yet not supremely powerful. And even when Lex's grand contingency plan of pitting both superheroes against each other ultimately fails (and that being only due to Superman saying Martha's name just in time to stop Batman's killing blow), a once again unfazed Lex reveals his far more grand and extreme second contingency plan (by promptly unleashing the mighty monster Doomsday), a plan that ultimately succeeds in carrying out Lex's goal of killing Superman, leaving Lex victorious. Furthermore, when Batman unexpectedly has Lex transferred from Belle Reve supermax to Arkham Asylum, Lex is yet again mostly unfazed, due to him having adapted a contingency plan for a break-out (and subsequent retreat to a contingency private yacht) at the optimal time. Even after Superman is resurrected from the dead more powerful than before and cements together the Justice League, Lex is as confident as ever in face of this greater challenge, and chooses this as the optimal time to escape Arkham, retreating to the contingency yacht, and meeting up with Deathstroke to discuss founding "a league of [his] own" as a contingency against the Justice League.
Master Deceiver:      Lex, convincingly feigning insanity.  Lex Luthor is phenomenally skilled in deception, outclassing even deceptive genius Batman himself in that regard, as he was, notably able to successfully hide his extremism under a kindly and altruistic fa√ßade, which was convincing enough to initially fool Wallace Keefe, Senator Barrows, the extremely perceptive Senator Finch, the insightful and brilliant reporters Superman and Lois Lane, and even the extremely experienced tactical and detective genius Batman, with none of them initially suspecting him to be hellbent on ending the Man of Steel. In addition, Lex deceived Amajagh and the entire CIA (by having Anatoli Knyazev and his men discreetly infiltrate the Nairomian warlord's ranks and incriminate Superman in the resulting bloodshed), was able to deceive the entire US Senate and general public (by having his discreetly hired manipulatee Kahina Ziri read the memorized deceitful script that Lex had written for her, while addressing the Senate and a live news reporter), was able to masterfully deceive Wallace Keefe into siding with him (by bribing him with a high-tech wheelchair and convincing him that he is a useful asset for Lex in changing the world's perception of Superman, while in fact he was a mere disposable pawn), was able to superbly deceive Wonder Woman, Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg (by successfully keeping discreet tabs on them without their knowledge, with only Wonder Woman figuring it out, but only when it was too late), was able to deceive the Fortress of Solitude's entrance into allowing him to pass (by posing as General Zod, using the fingerprints previously sliced off the latter's corpse), was able to mostly deceive the brilliant reporter Lois Lane (by leaving behind so few loose ends, that she was only able to identify him as the main supercriminal culprit behind Superman's framing after receiving some assistance from Jenet Klyburn and Secretary of Defense Swanwick, and even then she was unable to uncover his entire endgame, until it was too late), was able to masterfully deceive Superman into perceiving Batman as a threat and into angrily confronting the latter (by having Cesar Santos murdered in jail, and anonymously sending Clark photos of Santos' corpse), was able to superbly and easily deceive even the extremely experienced Batman himself into becoming his champion against Superman (by sending Bruce notes with provoking "red note" messages with "from" Wallace Keefe about the death of his employees in the Black Zero Event, by allowing Bruce to steal his data on kryptonite and metahumans, and later, by allowing him to steal the kryptonite itself, thereby convincing him that he genuinely, of his own accord, wished to kill Superman, while in fact he was a mere discreetly manipulated pawn), and was able to deceive even his personal assistant Mercy Graves, who knew him best, into getting killed (by having her attend Superman's hearing and convincing her that she is his right-hand woman and confidant, privy to all of his master plans, while in fact even she was a mere disposable liability). Lex's phenomenal deception supergenius was even effective following his imprisonment in Belle Reve supermax, as Lex very convincingly feigned insanity, thereby making himself unfit to stand trial for his numerous unspeakable crimes.
Lex, convincingly feigning insanity.
Master Manipulator: Lex Luthor is a terrifyingly accomplished manipulator, perhaps even rivaling the infamous Joker in this regard, as he was capable of steadily, with remarkable ease, turning Superman and Batman against one another by orchestrating several events capable of swiftly inciting their rage, with this ability also aiding Lex in gaining the many criminal allies that help him maintain the success of his oligarchical business empire.
Master Detective: Lex Luthor, although applying this talent for malicious purposes, has proven himself to be an extraordinarily masterful detective, with him masterfully employing multiple extremely well-concealed means such as planting cctvs in arenas of interest as well as hacking to swiftly deduce the truth, notably being able to effortlessly see through Batman's nearly inhuman fa√ßade regarding him being supernatural, deducing correctly that the latter was actually a mere man without any metahuman powers, in addition to Lex accurately discerning that Batman, despite his continued heroism, has in fact been emotionally darkened and embittered over all that he had witnessed in his many years of fighting crime in Gotham City, which Lex very masterfully used to his own advantage to easily get him to take action against Superman. Indeed, Lex's outstanding detective prowess enabled him to swiftly become one of the extreme few individuals to know not only Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and Flash's secret identities (the first one to know the secret identities of the entire future Justice League), but also the first to learn practically everything about both Batman and Superman (notably their powers, abilities, physical and emotional weaknesses, relationships, and psychological profiles), which allowed Lex to discreetly outwit, manipulate, and gain the upper hand against both superheroes with ease.</p></html>
