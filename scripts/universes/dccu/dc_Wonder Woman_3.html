<html><p>Sword of Athena: Wonder Woman's second sword, replacing the God Killer. The Sword of Athena is equally as powerful, and is one of the few weapons that can actually injure the otherwise invulnerable Doomsday.
Eagle shield: Wonder Woman's shield, which she uses to protect herself from other weapons and energy blasts (in tandem with her bracelets). Much like her bracelets, it is nigh-indestructible, capable of deflecting even Doomsday's thermal attacks. It can also be used as an offensive weapon, with Wonder Woman smashing it hard into the legs of Doomsday, thus momentarily managing to knock him down. She was also able to withstand the massive blows of the Steppenwolf's axe.
Wonder Woman's third sword: In the potential Knightmare future, Wonder Woman replaced the Sword of Athena with this sword.
Other equipment
Diana wearing her battle armor.
Armor: Wonder Woman wears a red armor body plate that bears a gold eagle-shaped breastplate, and a matching golden W-shaped belt plate. Below this is a blue skirt and knee-high dark red armored combat boots. The armor helps her compensate for any possible vulnerability to bullets and sharp objects .
General Antiope's tiara: Wonder Woman would wear it in loving memory of her beloved aunt and mentor Antiope, with Diana striving to be worthy of it, as the tiara signifies that it's wearer is the greatest Amazon warrior of them all.
Glasses: Wonder Woman's pair of glasses, which Steve insisted she wear attempting to conceal her identity and pose as a human (much like Superman) during World War I. They were quickly broken during a fight with General Ludendorff's spies.
Asteria's armor: Diana wore the armor for the first time in preparation for her final battle with Cheetah in 1984.
Vehicles
Invisible Jet: The Invisible Jet was a F-111 Aardvark kept in a storage hangar in the Roth Smithsonian Archives in Washington, D.C. until Diana and Steve decided they needed to steal it to prevent a global catastrophe.
E-Class Cabriolet: Diana's personal car, used for her travels.
Flying Fox: Wonder Woman, along with the Justice League, traveled to Pozharnov, Russia with the Flying Fox.

Trivia
Initially, being over 5,000 years old, she is the oldest member of the Justice League. However, it has been later confirmed that she is only 800 years old.
She is currently the only female member of the Justice League.
In the film, during the scene where Diana tries ice cream for the first time in the train station (and enjoys it) possibly alludes to Wonder Woman doing the same (albeit in the street) in Justice League Vol. 2 #3 in the New 52.

Diana is right-handed.
In all three films Diana has been in, she is never referred to as "Wonder Woman." In "Guiding Lights" she refers to herself as "Wonder Woman," and her logo used in Lex Luthor's data is two "W"s. The Aquaman film briefly shows a newspaper clipping that refers to her as Wonder Woman when Diana is asked for comment about the rumors of her dating Aquaman.
Likewise, Bruce Wayne is only called "Batman" three times in the run of the DCEU.
Likewise, Bruce Wayne is only called "Batman" three times in the run of the DCEU.
She is playable as "Dawn of Justice Wonder Woman" in the first Injustice Mobile game, based on her appearance in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. In her Themyscira armor she is playable as "Amazon Wonder Woman," and in normal armor, she is playable as "Mythic Wonder Woman" in Injustice 2 Mobile, both based on her appearances in Wonder Woman.
Wonder Woman in Crimean War.
According to multiple sources, the initial plan for the Wonder Woman movie was set in the 1850s during the Crimean War.
Behind the scenes
On December 4, 2013, Gal Gadot was announced to play Wonder Woman in a 3-film contract for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Wonder Woman and Justice League.
Gadot practiced Kung Fu, Kickboxing, Fencing, Jujitsu, and Capoeira as part of her extensive physical preparation for the role.
This version is the first live-action movie debut of the character.
In two social event scenes in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, it's implied the Wonder Woman character does not consume alcohol. Non-alcoholic consumption is a characteristic usually associated with Batman who, in this cinematic version, does consume alcohol. She is seen consuming a small amount of alcohol in Wonder Woman, however, when offered some by Steve Trevor.
Before Gadot was casted, Eva Green, Alexandra Daddario, Elodie Yung, Olga Kurylenko and Jaimie Alexander were all in early talks for the role of Wonder Woman.
Wonder Woman in the DC Extended Universe is the third live-action incarnation of the character, following incarnations portrayed by Cathy Lee Crosby and Lynda Carter.
Alicia Vela-Bailey, Georgina Rawlings, Joanna Bennett, Christiaan Schodel and Caitlin Dechelle were stunt doubles for Gal Gadot. Chelsea Mather was a stunt double for Emily Carey.
