Doctor Harleen Frances Quinzel is a former psychiatrist, previously employed at Arkham Asylum, a former criminal, a mercenary, and the ex-girlfriend of the Joker, operating under the alias Harley Quinn.

After being manipulated by the Joker into assisting his escape from Arkham, Harleen was submerged in a batch of chemicals at Ace Chemicals, re-emerging as the Joker's right-hand woman. Over the years, Harley has become a nemesis of the Batman, growing to become known as the queen of Gotham City alongside the Joker, notably committing numerous crimes, and while her allegiance with the Joker meant she was never in any real danger, her long history of violence would later catch up with her.

Quinn was later imprisoned in Belle Reve after her arrest by Batman and recruited into Task Force X, a covert operations team led by Amanda Waller, where she was forced to work with other dangerous criminals to complete missions for the government in exchange for time off her sentence. On her first assignment, she and the team brought down Enchantress in Midway City, earning her ten years off of her multiple life sentences, but was later rescued by the Joker during a prison break.

The Joker eventually broke up with her, though she tried to claim that the decision was mutual. Following the breakup, she kept quiet for a while before announcing it in a very public way by ramming a truck into Ace Chemicals, setting off a massive explosion. She had declared her emancipation, but by doing so had essentially set off an open season on her for the many people who held a grudge against her. She at first sought the protection of Black Mask after he tried to kill her, but eventually found her independence by saving the life of Cass Cain and teaming up with the group who would become the Birds of Prey. She then founded her own mercenary group with Cass, Harley Quinn and Associates.

Shortly after, Harley was recaptured and sent back to Belle Reve. She rejoined Task Force X for their mission to Corto Maltese, with the intent to destroy any traces of the dangerous and mysterious Project Starfish. When he arrived on the island, Harley saw how his companions were killed by the Corto Maltese Armed Forces, but she survived because she was captured by the soldiers and brought before Silvio Luna, with whom she later began a relationship, but upon hearing her evil plans, Harley killed him causing her to be locked up in the dungeon. Later, Harley managed to escape and joined a new Task Force X team to infiltrate Jotunheim. After the explosion, Harley and the surviving members, confronted Starro saving Corto Maltese and obtaining her freedom.

Biography
Early life
Childhood
Young Harleen at the orphanage
Harleen Frances Quinzel was born on July 20, 1990 in Gotham City. Harley's family life was largely dysfunctional as her drunkard father constantly tried to abandon her though she always found her way back home. At some point in her childhood, he sent her to an orphanage run by nuns in which her attitude landed her into multiple trouble to the point that Harley smashed a nun with an oar.

Upon reaching high school, Harley became known as a model student, achieving excellent grades as well as extensive gymnastics training. For her efforts, she was rewarded a full scholarship to Gotham City University where she majored in Psychiatry for her undergraduate degree, receiving supervision under Dr. Odin Markus. There she experienced several heartbreaks and was known to have had at least one boyfriend named Guy Kopski.

When creating her thesis, Harley was known to have courted trouble. The subject of Harley's thesis centered around the circumstances by which a person would disregard the rules of society. According to her thesis a person would only commit to such an action under two distinct circumstances: 1) When they commit a crime or 2) when they're in love. Harley then proposed to Dr. Markus a way by which this hypothesis could be examined. She would use herself and her boyfriend Guy as subjects, exploiting their relationship and putting it to the test.

During the test, Harley fabricated a story to tell her boyfriend Guy. She told him that she had run through a red light in a stolen car after blackmailing and possibly shooting Dr. Markus. She then asked Guy whether he still loved her. Guy's psyche later cracked under the pressure. Harley later found him laughing in a gymnasium, where he had shot and killed a homeless man who he had mistaken for Dr. Markus. He then begged Harley to help him end his life. Guy was then killed by gunfire but the details of Harley's involvement with the shooting remained unknown.

It would later come to light that Dr. Markus had in fact tampered with the test somehow, but at the time Harley was unaware of this aspect, simply choosing to credit the results to random chaos.

Becoming Harley Quinn
Falling for the Joker
Harleen talking to the Joker
Following her graduation, Quinzel's interest in chaos led to her transfer into the job as a psychiatrist intern at Arkham Asylum where she sought a first year residency. Her interest was simple: She wanted to monitor a patient called the Joker under the premise of writing a book about serial killers. After three months, the doctors finally allowed her full access to the Joker. This led to her regularly visiting and speaking with him. As their sessions went on, Quinzel was gradually manipulated by the psychopath, eventually falling in love with him, and the Joker got her to smuggle a machine gun into the sanitarium, leading to his escape. Before leaving however, the Joker subjected Quinzel to shock therapy, greatly affecting her mental state even further.

Chemical wedding
Joker and Harley laugh in the chemical bath
Quinzel later chased the Joker down and managed to get him to stop his car. She nearly killed him with a gun, even shooting a man who approached them. The Joker took the gun and taunted her. Quinzel wanted to come with him, so he took her to Ace Chemicals. While there, she was told to pledge an oath and was asked if she would die for him. She responded in the affirmative, and allowed herself to fall into the vat of chemicals that created the Joker years ago. The Joker considered leaving her to die, but promptly changed his mind and jumped in after her, pulling her up to the vat's surface. He then kissed her, and Quinzel awakened with the same frontotemporal dementia that her lover received via exposure to the chemicals and oxygen deprivation. She gazed at the Joker as he burst into maniacal laughter.

The King and Queen of Gotham
From that point on, the Joker dubbed her "Harley Quinn" (giving her a red-and-black Harlequin costume), and the duo of psychopathic lovers would go on a number of crime sprees in Gotham City together, which would often result in them coming into conflict with Batman, becoming (as Amanda Waller would later claim) the 'King and Queen' of Gotham City's criminal underworld.

After this, Harley Quinn committed numerous crimes, and while her allegiance with the Joker meant she was never in any real danger, her long history of violence would later catch up with her. Her crimes included theft, injury, and manslaughter.

Murder of Robin
The Joker, with Harley's help, managed to kill Batman's partner and adopted son, Robin. To add insult to injury to Batman's loss, in hopes of crippling and driving their mutual adversary insane, the Joker vandalized the Robin suit, spray-painting "HAHAHA JOKE'S ON YOU BATMAN" in yellow. A devastated Batman would later place the damaged suit in an exhibit in the Batcave. The duo's murder of Robin was one of the major reasons Batman became increasingly ruthless and vengeful in his war on crime.

Captured by Batman
Joker and Harley, greeted by Monster T
On October 13, 2014, Monster T, a fellow crime boss, visited a strip club owned by the Joker, greeted by the Joker himself. After exchanging stiff pleasantries, the Joker demanded Quinn to come over after noticing Monster T's lustful attraction towards her pole-dancing, calling her a "bad bitch" and greatly angering the Joker. The Joker watched on as Quinn teased Monster T, tempting him to have her to himself. Monster T, having become aware of the Joker's sarcasm, attempted to assure him that Harley is his girl, and that he wanted "no beef." The Joker, however, promptly shot Monster T in the head.

Harley is carried to the Batmobile by Batman
Afterward, the psychopathic duo drived down a Gotham City street in their Smiley Car, laughing maniacally. However, Batman pursued them in the Batmobile, and after putting his car on auto-pilot, leapt onto the Smiley Car's roof. Quinn, annoyed that Batman was ruining "date night," began to shoot the roof of the vehicle, though due to Batman's bulletproof suit, this proved ineffective. The Joker, attempting to shake Batman off, made a sharp turn that sent his car flying off the road and into the river, forcing Batman to grapple away. Batman then promptly put on a breather and dove into the river, finding the wrecked car and Quinn, but no Joker. Batman then reached towards her, who awakened and tried to stab him, but is knocked out and carried out of the river.

Laying her on the hood of the Batmobile, Batman checks for a pulse, but does not find one. With extreme reluctance, Batman proceeds to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to try and revive her. A pleased Harley recovered and began to kiss him. Her advances were rejected and she was taken by him into captivity.

Saving the world
Incarceration in Bell Reve
Harley in her cell.
ARGUS Director Amanda Waller had Quinn transferred to Belle Reve supermax. After putting several guards into the hospital, Quinn was eventually given her own special cell to keep her locked up and to keep the guards safe. The psychotic woman was put inside a small electrified cage inside of a barbed fence to keep her contained. Quinn was given barely any comforts or clothing; she used the sheets supplied for her gymnastic routines. 

Harley licking the bars of her cell
The sadistic guard, Hunter Griggs, usually force-fed and tortured Quinn, earning her anger over the prolonged months.

Meeting Amanda Waller
Months after Quinn was apprehended, Amanda Waller gathered other skilled individuals and metahumans for Project Suicide Squad. Upon her visit to Belle Reve to examine the future team, she visited Quinn outside her cage while the latter was meditating. Quinn was hypnotized by the government agents' presence and asked Waller if she was the Devil, to which Waller proclaimed that she was maybe so.

Deployment in Midway City
With the attack in Midway City, Michigan, orchestrated by the mystical duo Enchantress and Incubus, Harley, along with the other members of Suicide Squad (such as Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, El Diablo, and Killer Croc), are implanted with explosive nanotechnology provided by Dr. Van Criss. While being wheeled out to their transport, Griggs hands Harley a phone, telling her it was from Mr. J to get in contact with her. Harley then tells Griggs that he's "so screwed" and laughs maniacally as she's wheeled off into a chopper. 

Harley during Flag's briefing
Harley and the rest of the members arrive at an evacuation point outside the city, where they are joined by Slipknot. They are given instructions by Waller via an electronic tablet that they are under the direct command of her second-in-command Rick Flag and extracting a highly valued asset known as "HVT1" from the besieged city and will receive 10 years off of their life sentences as a reward. Flag warns them if they annoy him or try to escape, he will kill them by using his touchpad to detonate their implanted nanobots — blowing their heads off. Harley and the others receive their old costumes and weapons before departing by helicopter carrying the military Squad A to the extraction point. Before take-off, they are joined by Flag's personal bodyguard Katana, whom Harley takes a liking toward, despite the latter's hostility. 

Harley exits the downed chopper
While mid-flight en route to their destination, Harley looks at a new text from the Joker saying that he's coming to get her. Deadshot peers over to see, so she signals him to be quiet about it and he decides to comply. After their helicopter is shot down, the squad is forced to travel the rest of the way on foot, splitting up with Squad B, who are able to land their helicopter safely. After witnessing, Slipknot's explosive get activated, Harley and Deadshot bond and plot with the others against Flag to turn the odds in their favor the first chance they get.

Battle of Midway City
Harley fires at Enchantress' minions
Soon after, the group encounters creatures in the Enchantress' employment known as the Eyes of the Adversary. When Flag approaches them, the creatures become hostile and attack. The squad is initially overwhelmed as the Eyes capture Flag, much to Harley's delight. Deadshot, however, reminds her what Waller had said about the Squad members being as good as dead if the colonel is injured or killed, so she changes her mind and aids Flag with getting the monsters off of him. She continued to beat up the already-dead Eyes, claiming to have seen it flinching, but Deadshot stops her and they all move on to the task at hand. Flag contacts Waller when all contact with Squad B fails, and learns the other squadron was engaged with another group of Eyes at the same time, but have all been taken prisoner and brought to the Enchantress herself.

Retrieving HVT1
Harley stealing jewelry

About halfway to the building where HVT1 is located, Harley stops to smash the window of a Paris ReadyWear department store and steal a small purse that matches her harlequin aesthetic. Flag is startled and growls at her, but she responds by mocking her status of a "bad guy" and that it's expected of her.
Harley calls Deadshot a sellout
As the other squad members plan to infiltrate the John F. Ostrander Federal Building, Harley is distracted by a discarded motorcycle and experiences a flashback to the night she pursued Joker, before Deadshot snaps her out of it. Harley then begins to psychologically analyze the squad members due to her boredom. When Deadshot confronts her, Harley implies that she's aware of his deal with Rick Flag and voices her displeasure.

Harley quickly makes her way to the elevator
As the Squad enters the John F. Ostrander Federal Building, Harley quickly makes her way to the elevator, much to the annoyance of the other squad members. Harley receives another message from the Joker, telling her to be ready. Harley is then attacked by two of Enchantress' minions, whom Harley disposes of with her revolver and baseball bat.

The Squad huddles around Flag
As the squad proceeds further, they are alerted to movement in their area. Harley then proceeds to tease Deadshot for the use of his mask. Harley and the squad are then attacked by another wave of Eyes of the Adversary. As the battle goes on, the team notices Flag being taken once again. The squad huddles around Flag to protect him until the minions are seemingly cleared. As the squad makes their way to the stairway, they are attacked by another wave. After El Diablo swiftly clears the opposition, Harley hugs him and gives him a kiss on the cheek, telling him she knew he'd come through for them.

Harley points her gun at Deadshot
The Squad makes their way up the building, resulting in Harley becoming winded. As she stops to catch her breath, the familiarity of the environment causes her to flashback to the night at Ace Chemicals when the Joker had her bleach her skin for him. As Harley snaps out of her flashback, she quickly points her gun at Deadshot. Still recovering from her flashback, she asks Deadshot if he had ever been in love. After Deadshot tells her that something like love would keep him from performing his job, Harley only smiles and calls him "another textbook sociopath."

Once Harley and the squad made it to their destination, Flag ordered them to stay behind so they don't scare their target. HVT1 is then revealed to the squad as Amanda Waller, greatly angering most of the squad. Harley declares that she's not going back to prison; however, Waller gets her and the rest of the squad to back down by threatening to activate the explosives in their necks.

Mad love
Reuniting with Joker
The Squad makes their way to the top of the John F. Ostrander Federal Building and wait for extraction. However, Rick Flag quickly deduces that the arriving helicopter is compromised. The Joker and Jonny Frost open fire on the rooftop, causing the squad to take cover. However, Harley's explosive is disarmed by Van Criss under Joker's orders. Harley removes her jacket and leaps off the rooftop, grabbing onto the rope that Joker has dropped down for her. As the helicopter rises, Harley playfully blows a kiss to the rest of the Squad, as well as playing dead when Deadshot misses a shot at her.

Harley climbs into the helicopter and embraces Joker. However, their reunion is short lived as their helicopter is hit with a missile. As she and Joker both attempt to make their escape, a sudden explosion throws Harley out of the helicopter. Harley lands on the rooftop below and watches the helicopter, with Joker still in it, crash into a nearby building.

Drowning sorrows
Harley mourns The Joker
Harley makes her way down to street level. Heartbroken by the apparent death of the Joker, Harley removes and throws away her collar. Upon seeing the rest of Task Force X leave the John F. Ostrander Federal Building, she quickly brushes off her tears and resumes her usual behavior, telling the rest of the squad that she missed them. Captain Boomerang then returns the bat she had left behind and the squad moves on to once again retrieve Waller.

The Squad approaches the downed helicopter to find Waller has been taken. Now filled with despair on the realization that they must confront Enchantress and Incubus, the Squad, say for Deadshot, follow after. However, Deadshot soon stops Flag by throwing a Top Secret Binder at him before angrily demanding answers. After Flag explains their true situation, Harley follows after Deadshot into a nearby bar, giving a mocking bow to Flag in the process.

Harley in the bar
In the bar, Harley convinces Killer Croc to have a drink with the rest of the Squad. Harley then proceeds to pour drinks for the rest of the Squad. She joins the rest of the Squad in cheers after she makes her own drink, complete with an overabundance of drink umbrellas. Deadshot states his regret over their situation, causing El Diablo to lash out at him and eventually break down, revealing his tragic past. Angry at Diablo's guilt, Harley yells at him to own up to his mistakes and to accept that a normal life isn't possible for them, causing Boomerang to call her out on her vexing behavior. Harley then goes on to state that they're all ugly on the inside, just like her, except for Croc, who's also ugly on the outside. When Croc claims he is beautiful, Harley nods in agreement to him owning his physical attributes.

When Flag enters the bar, Harley coldly tells him they don't want him there. Flag then explains his relationship with June Moone before destroying his device controlling the nanites in the Squad's necks. Flag then shows Deadshot the letters his daughter had been sending him, prompting Deadshot to tell Flag that he's going to help him stop the Enchantress. Harley then cheerfully tells them that she'll come along, telling the others that they don't have anything else better to do. She then quickly teases the rest of the squad before leaving, goading them to jump into action.

Visions and facing Incubus
The Squad made their way to the subway station and began to prepare for the coming battle. Flag explained their plan: to lure Incubus over a charge and destroy him. Harley, along with Flag, Deadshot, and Captain Boomerang had one last conversation before they headed into the subway.

Harley Quinn's vision
Harley and the Squad had made their way into the subway. Harley quickly asked the others if they could see the effects of the Enchantress' machine, unsure whether or not her lack of medicine was causing her to hallucinate. However, she and the Squad were quickly detected by the Enchantress and told to come out of the hiding, which Harley quickly obeyed, much to the dismay of Deadshot and Flag, who pulled her back into hiding. The Enchantress then went on to explain that they aren't enemies, feeding them visions of "exactly" what they wanted. Harley was greeted with a vision of a "normal" life with the Joker, with a family and children. In this fantasy, Harley was a housewife named Harley Ker while Joker was a business exec named Jo Ker.

Harley after being knocked aside by Incubus
However, El Diablo quickly broke them out of their visions, despite Harley being more hesitant to leave her vision. The Enchantress then summons Incubus to deal with the Squad. Harley and the others quickly duck for cover to avoid his lethal attacks. However, once El Diablo is knocked aside, Harley, along with Boomerang and Deadshot, reenter the fight but are ultimately ineffective against Incubus. However, El Diablo re-emerges and manages to fight Incubus off. However, as El Diablo begins to lose his strength and shouts for the charge to be set off anyway, Harley can only let out a small "No" before the charge is set off by Edwards, killing both El Diablo and Incubus.

Battle against Enchantress
Harley apologizing to Enchantress
As the Squad approaches Enchantress, she unleashes the full power of her weapon, disorientating the Harley and the other Squad members. Enchantress then reverts to her feral form and attacks the Squad, during which, Harley is smacked aside. Enchantress disappears, much to the Squad's displeasure, to only reappear shortly after, wielding dual blades. The Squad continues to fight Enchantress, to where the witch nearly has Harley cornered, only for Harley to avoid the attack at the last moment. Harley eventually lands a hit on Enchantress' head, which seemed to only make the witch more irritated. Harley quickly apologizes and is seemingly knocked out of the fight by a hard blow from Enchantress.

Harley then tells the others that perhaps they should join Enchantress
Enchantress retreats from the fight once again, this time disarming Harley and the rest of the Squad. Enchantress once again offers them a chance to join her, this time due to impressing her in battle. Harley then tells the others that perhaps they should join. When Deadshot tries to remind her that Enchantress is trying to take over the world, Harley rebuts him by telling him that they don't owe the world anything. 

Harley throwing a gun to Deadshot
As Harley approaches Enchantress, she asks if she can bring back the Joker. When Enchantress tells her she can, Harley tells her that the only problem is that Enchantress messed with her friends. Harley then grabs the Soultaker and cuts Enchantress' chest open, allowing her to rip out the witch's heart. The rest of the Squad quickly moves to disable Enchantress' weapon. Harley quickly tosses Deadshot her handgun, allowing him to shoot the charges and destroy the weapon.

Escaping Belle Reve
Harley back in her cell
Shortly after their victory, Harley watches as Rick Flag begs Enchantress to bring June Moone back before eventually crushing her heart, killing her. Fortunately, Moone survived this and reunites with Flag, something Harley is happy to see. As the rest of the Squad readies to re-enter the world, Harley herself is ready to hot wire a car, Amanda Waller appeared and reactivated their explosives. Harley is at first appalled since Waller didn't thank them for saving the world. However, once Waller does thank them, Harley cheerfully tells her she's welcome. When Waller then allows them to make specialized requests, Harley asks for an espresso machine.

Harley embraces Joker
Back in Belle Reve, while Harley is enjoying her espresso machine, the wall outside her wall explodes, allowing The Joker's gang to break in and storm the prison. Harley's cell is forced open with a buzzsaw, allowing Joker to enter and reveal himself to Harley he is still alive. Harley embraces her once lost love and Joker tells her that they're going home.

At some point before this, she also voted for a politician named Bernie Sanders.

Emancipation
Breaking up with Joker
Sometime after returning home, Joker broke up with Harley Quinn, with one of his henchmen throwing her out into the streets. 

The destruction of Ace Chemicals
In the aftermath of the breakup, Quinn found herself somewhat adrift, as while she was seemingly free, she had not publicly announced her breakup. She adopts a hyena, which names Bruce after Bruce Wayne. Those few that she did tell simply didn't believe her and she found herself largely alone and friendless. One night, Harley went to a nightclub owned by gangster Roman Sionis, the Black Mask. After the latter's driver insulted her, she promptly crippled him. She then met burlesque singer Dinah Lance. Thinking quickly, she decided to announce her breakup in a big way, stealing a truck and sending it hurtling into Ace Chemicals, resulting in a massive explosion. She soon discovered, however, that declaring her independence came with consequences, as it resulted in pretty much everyone she had ever wronged deciding that it was open season on her. Those with grudges were numerous and she soon started finding enemies around every corner, unable to even enjoy her favorite breakfast sandwich without being attacked. She tried to refashion herself as a mercenary and finder of lost things, but her past finally caught up with her.


She was eventually surrounded and captured by the Black Mask. She was not entirely certain why she had done to anger the misogynistic sociopath, but listed his possible grievances against her as "having a vagina," "pronounced it 'expresso'," "voted for Bernie" and "calling him Romey." He planned to exact this punishment on her, but upon overhearing that he had lost a valuable diamond, she offered to find it for him, describing herself as an expert finder and telling him that he had nothing to lose. The offer appealed to him and he decided to let her go, but not before putting out a general reward of $500,000 to anyone who could bring him Cassandra Cain, the young pickpocket who had taken the diamond.


Travels with Cassandra Cain
Harley raids the GCPD
Harley tracked Cain to the Gotham City Police Department, where she enacted a daring plan using paintballs, pyrotechnics and martial arts to storm her way past the cops and steal a keycard to make her way to Cain's cell. She breaks her out, but her actions also result in the release of the other prisoners in the cell-block, resulting in a three-way fight between her, the escaped prisoners and the other mercenaries sent to try to capture Cassandra Cain. In an epic battle that tested her skills of martial arts, she took down all challengers and finally managed to escape with Cain, though not before stopping Cain herself from fleeing.

Shopping cart rampage
She traveled with Cain to a local grocery store where she loaded a cart with a large supply of laxatives and food items intended to try to get the diamond out of Cain. At the store, Cain expresses an admiration for the way she lives her life and asks how she could be like her. In response, she gives Cain a brief summary of her life history, saying that the only way to be like her is to have done all that. Cain was astonished that her rich life, that she could shop at such a fancy store, but she explained that they weren't shopping, they were stealing. At this point, she and Cain raced with the cart, running down an aisle and straight through a checkout lane, pushing away a worker before bursting out the door and away.

Attack at Doc's Place
Harley and Cassandra unsheltered after the attack at Dock's place
Harley took Cassandra Cain to Doc's Place, where she intended to lay low. As they had a meal at the restaurant, she told Cassandra to always order the Mongolian beef with extra hot sauce in order to mask the taste. She then took her to her flat on the second floor, where she intended to lay low until she could turn Cain over to the Black Mask. She bonded with Cain over cartoons and ice cream. She also introduced Cain to Bruce, her pet hyena. Cain was at first shocked at Bruce being a hyena, but quickly grew used to the idea. The Huntress, who went to Doc's Place, was hoping that Harley could provide her with info on the location of Victor Zsasz, the last of her family's killers that she had yet to track down and kill in return. However, Harley and Cain's cozy little affair was quickly broken up when the place was attacked by a stranger resentful with Harley, who threw a bomb at her department. Harley and Cain managed to escape, but lost track of Bruce in the process, believing him to have been killed. Afterwards, Harley found Doc packing a vehicle outside and got out of him that she had sold her out in exchange for a large amount of money. She expressed shock over this, thinking that he was the one person that she could truly trust, but he told her that it was just business and that he planned to use the money to restart his business in a better and more profitable location.

The Booby Trap
Realizing just what she was up against, Harley contacted Black Mask to renegotiate the terms of their deal. She would deliver Cain to him, but in exchange, she wanted the protection of him and his organization from the myriad enemies that were now coming after her. The Black Mask reluctantly agreed to this deal and she agreed to deliver Cain to the Booby Trap, an abandoned amusement park on Amusement Mile at the Gotham waterfront. She traveled there and tied Cain up, sitting her on a toilet. Having dosed her up with laxatives from the store and greasy food, she hoped that she could get the diamond out of her before someone cut it out of her. Cain, who had come to idolize her, felt betrayed. Then, Renee Montoya showed up. A detective with the Gotham City Police Department, Montoya had been building a case against the Black Mask and was now determined to rescue Cain and the diamond before Black Mask could capture her. Around the same time, Victor Zsasz also arrived, in tow with Dinah Lance, a singer turned personal driver for the Black Mask Club. He had sussed out that Lance had called Montoya and betrayed the group, and was determined to both kill Lance and secure Cain and the diamond once and for all for the Black Mask. Before he could do either, however, Huntress showed up and killed him with her crossbow pistol, making him the last victim of her spree of revenge.

The Birds of Prey unite.
Harley Quinn was caught in the middle of all of this, but before she could do anything else, the Black Mask arrived at the Booby Trap with a small army. She told the group that they were going to have to work together to defeat him, each of them having their own reasons. Renee Montoya was dumb enough to be building a case against him, Dinah Lance because she had betrayed him, the Huntress because he was the mastermind behind those who had killed her family and Cain because he wouldn't stop until he had killed her and secured the diamond. They agreed and the battle began. During the battle, Harley proves her mettle by using her martial arts skills to take down numerous minions of Black Mask. Ultimately, however, she was not able to prevent Cain from being snatched and driven away.

Rescue

A chase ensued, with Huntress using her motorcycle to pull Harley as he traveled on rollerskates. This enabled Harley to catch up with Black Mask's motorcade. She caused them to crash, but he escaped, taking Cain to a nearby pier. Harley pursued him there, leading to a final confrontation. She told him that it was her that he needed to be afraid of. While he was distracted by her, Cain planted a grenade on him. In the process of trying to find the grenade, he dropped his guard and she kicked him into the water and as he fell, he was blown up by the grenade.

Harley Quinn and Associate
A new beginning
Harley Quinn drives off into her new life
With its leader dead, the Black Mask's organization dissolved. After forming the Birds of Prey with the unlocked Bertinelli fortune, Black Canary, Huntress and Renee Montoya gave the Bertinelli diamond to Harley Quinn. She and Cain sold it at a pawnshop and used the proceeds to found their own association.

The New Suicide Squad
Mission in Corto Maltese
Harley talks to her new team.
In 2021, Harley was recaptured after crashing her vehicle into a bank, and was sent back to Belle Reve, where she re-joined Task Force X. She was assigned as part of a strike team led once again by Rick Flag, containing returning member Captain Boomerang, and all-new members Savant, Weasel, Mongal, Blackguard, Javelin, and the Detachable Kid. She helped them infiltrate Corto Maltese, intent on destroying the mysterious and dangerous Project Starfish. When her strike team failed on their initial invasion, Harley fled into the Maltese jungles, and later cities, where she was captured.

Love affair with Silvio Luna and escape
Harley in Corto Maltese.
After she was captured, Harley was taken to meet Presidente Silvio Luna. Luna revealed that he, along with all other Corto Maltese citizens, viewed her as an anti-American icon and hero. Luna also revealed that he was infatuated with Harley and the two shared a romantic evening. After making love, Luna asked Harley to marry him, a proposal she would've accepted had Luna not revealed his fascist and authoritarian way of governing his people. After hearing the red flags, Harley immediately shot Luna in the heart with an antique gun on display in his bedroom. She revealed to him that although drastic and over-the-top the reaction was, she couldn't let Luna live as all the men in her life always came back to torment her with their cruelty. Harley was immediately detained by the General Mateo Suarez who, upon Luna's demise, assumed the role of presidente, and begun to interrogate Harley to get information on the remaining task force members on Corto Maltese. 

Harley joins the new team.
She easily escaped, feigning incapacitation. Upon her escape she recovered Javelin's javelin and bumped into Flag again, now leading a second Squad strike team consisting of Bloodsport, the Peacemaker, Ratcatcher 2, King Shark, and Polka-Dot Man, all leading a mission to rescue her. Still under orders from Waller, Harley joined the group on their mission (still to destroy Project Starfish), aided by their captured enemy, the Thinker.

Infiltration in Jotunheim
Harley, Bloodsport, and Polka-Dot Man flee from the explosion
Harley and her team split up into teams with Bloodsport, Polka-Dot Man, and King Shark to place bombs around a military building, while having to face some guards. After Harley getting her memory refreshed about Milton, they get up from their hiding spots, but more guards show up. Once the bombs get detonated accidently, Harley saves Polka-Dot Man from the explosion, and the others swim and try to make it out, then Harley and Polka-Dot Man meet up with Bloodsport, Ratcatcher 2, and King Shark.

Facing Starro
Harley and the Squad chase after Starro.
Starro arises while the remaining squad members run, Harley trips and sees Starro emerge. Harley works with her team to defeat Starro, she tries to cover her face to avoid being controlled by the starfish. Harley follows with the others after realizing what she has the javelin for, then head on to save the city from Starro. 

Harley attacks Starro.
Later, Harley is asked to get the higher ground from Bloodsport, she does but King Shark gets slammed into the same building she is on, causing it to fall down, Harley falls but is still alive. After Ratcatcher 2 sends in swarms of rats, Harley rushes Starro and manages to stab him in the eye with her javelin. Harley's breach into Starro's eye allows Ratchatcher's rats entry and they immediately swim to eat away at the eye's veins and lens, exposing the optic nerve. Harley is left bewildered by her surroundings. 

Harley and the Squad are now free.
Once Starro falls Harley emerges from the eye and gives Bloodsport a thumbs up. He and Harley have a talk about Bloodsports name being Milton and how they both were friends with Flag, as Harley tries to be Bloodsports friend due to him not having many. Bloodsport strikes up an agreement for him and the rest of the team to be set free once back in the US, having using the drive Flag stole of Project Starfish as blackmail. Harley, Bloodsport, Ratcatcher 2, and King Shark all board the helicopter back to America with Harley, passing out from exhaustion, now a free woman again.

Knightmare Future
Death
Sometime before or after the corruption of Superman and the fall of Earth, Harley reportedly perished, with Batman supposedly witnessing her final moments. According to Batman, as she was dying in his arms, she asked Batman to kill the Joker slowly if the two ever met again. Batman later met Joker and formed an alliance of necessity with him to potentially undo the nightmare-ish future that had unfolded. During a heated disagreement, Batman recounted this version of events to Joker. Although Joker was seemingly disturbed for a few moments, he seemed to be either unwilling to believe the account or doubt Batman's commitment to commit to such an action.

Personality
Even after having a traumatized childhood, Harleen Frances Quinzel was supposedly once a highly intelligent, calm, and compassionate young lady who worked at Arkham Asylum, before the Joker transformed her both mentally and physically into "Harley Quinn." In truth however, even before she met Joker she was already demonstrating dark tendencies. As a child her troublesome attitude could still be seen as a reaction to her treatment by her father and the nuns, but it was really in college where her darker side began to manifest. She came up with a thesis to psychologically test her boyfriend's love for her, ultimately causing him to kill for her as well as lose his life in the process. Through the shock therapy and the Joker's manipulation, her mind and emotions were twisted to the point where she transformed into a person barely recognizable from the woman she once was, becoming a homicidal, sadistic, childlike, and somewhat psychopathic villain, who would use sexuality and her playful personality to achieve her goals or to entertain herself, usually harming others in the process. She followed the Joker in whatever he demanded of her, blindly smitten with the ruthless psychopath, affectionately referring to him as "puddin'," prior to their final breakup.

Harley carries almost an innocent persona, wide-eyed and bright, finding humor in otherwise dark situations, much like Joker himself. After attacking Belle Reve guards and seriously injuring a couple before finally being restrained, she maniacally began giggling to herself in a sinister way, happy and pleased with how funny she found it, showing how fractured her psyche had become. However, behind the smiles laid a very depressed, broken and melancholic woman with poor self-esteem suffering from her dependence on the Joker to the point to obviously she is hurt emotionally than being truly happy, despite claiming otherwise. In fact, Joker treated Harley more like a piece of property than someone he truly loves.

However, despite her seemingly flaky demeanor, Harley is still highly intelligent, even showing traces of her psychologist expertise, as Harley was able to make swift breakdowns of the psychological profiles of her teammates, knowing exactly what to say in order to get under their skin (proudly referring to herself as "vexing"), though Deadshot calls her out on this. Her intellect also extends itself to tactical skills, as Harley notably assisted the Joker in the murder of Robin, suggested to Deadshot and Captain Boomerang a feasible escape option from the Suicide Squad, and even swiftly improvised a plan to weaken and take down the extremely powerful Enchantress, which proved successful.

Harley is also quite tough and pathologically fearless (another trait she shares with her boyfriend), fighting alongside the Suicide Squad and having fun doing so. With the team, she is shown to get along well with them, once she got to know them a bit better, with Harley acting as a bartender at a derelict bar. She even seemed horrified before El Diablo's death, imploring Rick Flag not to blow him up even though she knew it was their only way to destroy Incubus.

She has a very dim view on a regular life, stating "normal is a setting on the washer" to El Diablo, who lost his family because of his powers; however, until her emancipation Harley once had the dream of having a family with the Joker, as Enchantress' implanted vision revealed. She secretly holds a desire to be normal and hopes the Joker does the same for her.

Following her breakup with the Joker, Harley Quinn was initially devastated beyond endurance, frequently crying and binging in order to relieve the pain she was going through. As a mark of her pathological fearlessness, she also adopted and tamed a hyena. After her emancipation, she was forced to look out for herself. She was troubled by the specter of those who told her that she couldn't succeed on her own, but quashed those voices to make her own way. Although she at first sought the protection of the Black Mask from the powerful enemies she had made, she eventually displayed remorse at selling out Cassandra Cain to him and turned over a new leaf by fighting off him and his forces before making Cain her apprentice.

Much like Billy Batson, her experiences with her new team have been a journey of renewal for her as she finds a new family that has experienced similar hardships and has similar goals. In addition, her ability to genuinely love, while impaired by her subjection to chemicals, seems to have been restored as her regard for human life increases, albeit to a limited extent, coupled with her gradually realizing that everything people do inevitably carries some form of an aftermath. Despite this, she never truly reached hero status, as most of her decisions were still rather self-serving in nature.

Although often painted as a victim of psychological abuse, the Joker himself claims very little credit for Harley's condition. According to the Clown Prince of Crime, Harley was always sad and depressed deep down (simply better at controlling her insanity than most), and that he himself had merely made all her madness rise to the surface. It should be noted, however, that Joker's insanity occasionally induces him to make conclusions that only make sense to him, hence this might not necessarily be the actual case.
