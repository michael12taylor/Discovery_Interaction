<html><p>Kryptonian physiology: As a Kryptonian, Superman possesses a wide variety of immense, seemingly godlike abilities. On a planet near a red star, Superman would have physical attributes nearly identical to those of humans, but while on a planet near a star that is younger and brighter than Krypton's, he is granted many new abilities and powers that surpass the capabilities of humans and metahumans alike, making him the Justice League's most powerful member and appear godlike to humans (indeed rivaling an Old God in power). Having spent nearly his entire life on Earth and adapted to its environment, Superman exceeds any Kryptonian that has immediate exposure in terms of both raw power and skill in the application of said powers. His father Jor-El stated that he'd grown more powerful than he'd previously imagined, and the only way to know just how powerful was to keep testing his limits. Bruce Wayne has even stated that Superman is capable of single-handedly wiping out the entire human race should he choose to, likening him as being stronger than a planet, and Amanda Waller spearheaded the creation of Task Force X in order to have a team capable of combating an opponent of Superman's power. After his resurrection, he single-handedly overpowered the combined might of the Justice League and Steppenwolf, an ancient New God, with relative ease.

Superhuman strength: Superman possesses immense levels of strength that is virtually incalculable and limitless, as he is able to carry, lift and exert billions of tons of force.[citation needed] As a teenager, he was able to push a school bus out of a river and warp a fence post by squeezing. Even while limited by his internal struggles, Clark was still incredibly strong enough to swiftly destroy a trucker's rig with lumber, to crush a Kryptonian android, and hold up an oil rig's collapsing drilling derrick, though the latter visibly strained him. After reaching his full potential, he became considerably stronger, with his punches being powerful enough to generate shock waves during combat. He's capable of effortlessly hurling semi-trucks across extreme distances, destroying mountaintops, towing a massive steamship through the Arctic, effortlessly crush diamonds with his bare hands, and even flying against the opposing force of a World Engine's gravity beam. During the Battle of Smallville, Superman could take Zod by the waist and hit him several times in the face without Zod being able to react, although it must be taken into account that Superman took Zod by surprise. Also, although he was initially subdued, he was able to dominate Faora-Ul, who was an extremely fierce and formidable combatant, knocking her down twice even while being beaten by Nam-Ek, as well as subduing the latter by throwing him against a train car. He could also ultimately overpower Zod, throwing him away with a powerful blow, as well as taking Zod by the neck and smashing him into a building and hitting him three times in a row causing him some pain, and could even break the neck of the latter with a single movement, although he had to exercise a considerable force to do it. He was also able to quickly get rid of a car that fell during the battle with Zod. Superman was also able to lift a train to save the people inside it. During their second encounter, even while holding back, Superman proved to still considerably surpass the heavily armored Batman in strength, just merely light blows alone knocking around the Dark Knight and once getting angry, proceeding to easily tackle and throw him through several stone columns with a simple body slam and backhand with enough force to clearly hurt Batman, as well as cracking the armor with a punch to the face, and would have completely overwhelmed him had he not been exposed to kryptonite gas. Even while not fully recovered from inhaling it, Superman was strong enough to block a kick from the armored Batman and toss him through a concrete wall. He claimed that had he wished to, he could easily kill Batman despite his armor. Superman was even able to hold his own in a prolonged ferocious battle with the stronger Doomsday, capable of sending him flying with his punches and even at one point restraining the colossal juggernaut long enough to have both of them hit by a 300 kiloton nuke and despite having been mortally wounded by being stabbed by Doomsday's spiky hand, still able to fully pierce his skin with the kryptonite spear to finally bring him down, although at the cost of his own life. After his resurrection, Superman used his strength more freely in his confusion and easily overpowered the combined might of the Justice League, launching Aquaman flying and out of the fight for a time with a single mighty punch, punching Wonder Woman a great distance away even when she blocked his attack with her shield, yanking himself free of the Lasso of Hestia and pulling Wonder Woman to him, keeping her restrained with a single hand while easily remaining firm when the other Justice Leaguers tried to flank him before easily tossing them away and knocking out the Flash with a single glancing blow. He was also able to steadily overcome Cyborg's attempts to hold him back, soon easily tossing him to the ground and then aside, and down Wonder Woman with two mighty headbutts, leaving her stunned for a while, and effortlessly swat Batman away with enough force to severely bruise him later on enough to require treatment from Wonder Woman. He later overpowered Steppenwolf with ease, a feat the other Leaguers had been struggling (and failing) to do, with each of his punches dealing considerable damage to the New God. With Cyborg's help, the duo were able to separate the Mother Boxes before they could activate, although not without considerable difficulty. According to a newspaper, he even had enough strength to move tectonic plates while preventing an earthquake from occurring. The only beings that possess strength superior to Superman's are Doomsday and Darkseid.

Nigh-invulnerability: Superman's body is virtually indestructible, allowing him to withstand the extreme heat of an oil rig conflagration, the extreme cold of the Arctic, exposure to the vacuum of outer space, falls from great heights, and a high-speed collision with a mountaintop without injury. High caliber bullets bounce off of him, and artillery, including anti-tank depleted uranium rounds and Maverick missiles, have no effect. Superman was completely unaffected by the explosion caused at the US Capitol Building. He also was able to withstand plasma bolts from Kryptonian weapons and tendrils of service robots with no signs of visible damage, seemingly only suffering slight harm, and withstood the full force of a World Engine's colossal gravity beam and the singularity from the Black Zero’s Phantom Drive exploding, which caused him noticeable pain but otherwise did not injure him. Superman was also able to take attacks from other Kryptonians while only being knocked back and suffering little pain and harm, and he was even able to withstand the destructive electrical shock waves and thermal blasts as well as tremendous blows from the stronger Doomsday without any issue. Later, Superman was able to endure a direct hit from Cyborg's plasma cannon with no damage, only being slightly knocked back and suffering minimum pain to where he was mostly irritated. Soon after, Cyborg's punches weren't even able to so much as faze him in the slightest. He also took a mighty head-butt from Wonder Woman (which was strong enough to generate a shockwave) with no injury or damage at all from the attack, only being dazed by the hit. Steppenwolf's Electro Axe, which could notably harm even incredibly durable beings like Wonder Woman and Aquaman and casually dismember the likes of Atlanteans and Amazons, also had absolutely no effect on him, as he was able to effortlessly withstand the blow without even flinching. Superman's body also maintained its invulnerability after his death, as the lack of cellular decay allowed the Justice League to resurrect him. Even while he was weakened by kryptonite, which Batman used during their duel in Gotham, Superman retained incredible enough levels of superhuman durability to survive blows from the armored Batman, which had considerable superhuman strength and threw him through concrete and a remarkable distance, though he was left reeling but otherwise he seemed to be mostly uninjured, and as he recovered, he took the armored Batman's punches while only getting his face turned back and otherwise being clearly only irritated by Batman's persistance before he fully recovered and the punches Batman attempted didn't even faze him to where Batman attempting to punch him caused a strong metal-like sound. However, Superman's invulnerability still ultimately has it's limits, as after being weakened by kryptonite, he barely survived a hit from a nuclear bomb, being left near death, and potentially would have died had he not been exposed to the sun, and Doomsday was able to pierce through his chest and mortally wound him, though it's unclear whether or not that would have been enough to kill him had he not also been exposed to the kryptonite from the spear he was holding and using against Doomsday. In addition, the supernatural and matter-manipulating explosion of the Mother Box Unity completely vaporized him along with the other league members and Steppenwolf and he was only saved and restored when Flash reversed-time so the Unity never successfully occurred.
Regenerative healing factor: Superman is shown to heal at incredible rates when exposed to the solar radiation of a yellow sun. He was able to quickly recover from the stress of battling the World Engine once exposed to sunlight, and later a wound on his face inflicted by kryptonite healed with direct exposure to the sun. Superman was able to recover from his desiccated corpse-like state from being hit by a nuclear missile moments after being exposed to the sun.
Self-sustenance: Superman is able to survive in the harshest of environments without food, water, air or sleep for indefinite periods of time, as evidenced during his self-imposed exile in the Arctic for a few days, in addition to his remaining underwater and in the vacuum of space without experiencing any negative effects.

Superhuman speed: Superman can run and fly faster than the speed of sound. During his first flight, Superman traveled all the way from the Arctic to the savannas of Kenya and then to the Monument Valley in Utah, all in a matter of minutes. He was able to fly through the World Engine's gravity beam to destroy it. Later, Superman was able to tackle Amajagh away from Lois Lane before he managed to use his gun to shoot her. Superman is fast enough to escape the gravitational pull of a Phantom Zone singularity. His speed is easily capable of surpassing that of Aquaman and Wonder Woman, as he easily reacted to Arthur's attempt to stab him even when he had the advantage of having super-jumped and was close to doing so and managed to move faster than the clashing motion Wonder Woman was about to made to activate her bracelets with ease and simultaneously expose her to land a head-butt before successfully knocking her down with yet another attack before she could react, although Wonder Woman seemed to be able to keep up just enough to land a single blow on her own, and while his strength and durability was inferior to Doomsday, his speed was the only thing superior to the monstrous juggernaut, allowing Superman to hold his ground despite the advantage the mutated Kryptonian had and restrain him. In addition, Superman proved able to easily surpass Steppenwolf's speed, dodging his blows with virtually no effort and at one point completely catching him off-guard to knock down and pummel him. Superman is even capable of moving at a level of speed close to the Flash, as when the Flash attempted to freeze him in place, Superman was not affected and was able to closely pursue the Flash, with the latter barely able to dodge most of Superman's blows, before finally knocking him out with a glancing blow and shortly afterwards, Superman was able to dodge Flash's super-speed charge, forcing him to run into Aquaman.
Superhuman reflexes:      Superman dodging Steppenwolf's attack  Superman's speed extends to his reflexes as well, as he managed to caught a punch from the larger Kryptonian Nam-Ek while being pinned by him and Faora-Ul, and later easily caught a grenade shot at him by Batman at close range. He was able to stop Wonder Woman from clashing her bracelets together, dodge all of Steppenwolf's attacks, and even perceive and react to the Flash's incoming attack despite simultaneously battling Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Cyborg. Like the Flash, Superman sees others as slowed to the point they're all but frozen in place, though the Flash moves at normal speed while in this state.

Superhuman stamina: Superman almost never seems to grow tired. He is able to survive flying at high speeds into outer space and underwater. After reaching his full potential, Superman hardly showed signs of fatigue, notably towing a gigantic tanker ship by its chain through ice without any resistance. While he was severely weakened from the effort of destroying a World Engine, Superman was able to recover almost instantly under direct sunlight and fly back to Metropolis. He could resist the pull of a Phantom Zone singularity and fight General Zod shortly after. Even during his ferocious battle with the stronger Doomsday, Superman never slowed down.
Flight: Clark can fly via manipulations to his own gravitational field, taking advantage of Earth's weaker gravity to propel himself through the skies and even beyond the planet's atmosphere. Upon mastering this technique, Superman can fly at hypersonic speeds that allow him to circle the globe in moments. Further practice with this power has allowed him to extend it to others, most notably Lois Lane, so that they don't experience the negative effects of traveling at high speeds.
Superhuman breath: Superman is capable of surviving prolonged periods without oxygen, allowing him to walk through a burning oil rig, travel at tremendous hypersonic speeds, and even remain underwater or within the vacuum of space without adverse effects.
Arctic breath: Following his resurrection, Superman displayed the ability to significantly focus the intensity of his breath to the point of freezing targets by blowing on them. This ability was powerful enough to freeze Steppenwolf's Electro Axe to the point that he was able to shatter it with a single strike.
Hypersonic scream: As an infant, Clark was able to release a scream that shattered every glass or ceramic object along Main Street in Smallville, Kansas. After being impaled in the chest Doomsday during the Battle of Gotham City, Superman let out a hypersonic scream of agony so powerful that it reverberated around the world, awakening the Mother Boxes in Gotham, Atlantis, and Themyscira.

Superhuman vision: Superman possesses superhuman eyesight that encompasses a variety of sensory capabilities including telescopic, infrared, ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma-ray visual capabilities that allow him to see the entire electromagnetic spectrum when he desires, through mental focus. In his youth, his enhanced vision overwhelmed him, as he saw everything in his hometown at once, though he managed to hone his senses after some guidance from Martha Kent.
Telescopic vision: Superman has the ability to focus his vision to see great distances. Hence, he was able to see the Black Zero in low orbit from his parent's farm, and later saw Lois Lane within a falling drop pod.
X-ray vision: Superman can focus his vision past layers of matter to see through them. He was able to clearly see through the one-way glass in the interrogation room to read Emil Hamilton's ID badge in the latter's pocket, and simultaneously see through walls to identify the squad of soldiers nearby. The only known materials known to be impenetrable to Superman's X-ray vision are lead, the force-field of a Kryptonian Breather, as well as the Kryptonian metal used on vehicles such as Scout Ship 0344 and the Black Zero.
Heat vision:     Superman using his heat vision against Zod  Superman possesses the ability to emit beams of intense heat and concentrated plasma from his eyes that can reach temperatures of 5500 °C. These beams have the same nature  as the Kryptonian and Apokoliptian plasma rifles, (only thinner and much more powerful), which was how Batman blocked them with his gauntlets. Visually, the power manifests as two laser-like beams of fiery energy being released from his eyes, with the surrounding areas being outlined as the energy builds. These beams can be made less intense to the point of being invisible, allowing Clark to work undetected. Clark has developed extremely fine control of this ability, as he was able to cauterize Lois Lane's wound, and previously cut a tunnel into layers of thick ice in the Arctic to reach the alien vessel hidden within. At full power, Clark can utilize his heat vision to dismember humans, quickly melt a thick steel beam, and momentarily stun other Kryptonians. He was able to destroy the helm of Scout Ship 0344's bridge and the automated machine gun turrets used by Batman in their fight. However, Superman's heat vision was not powerful enough to match that of Doomsday, as the latter was able to overwhelm Superman during their standoff.

Superhuman hearing: Superman is able to hear at extreme variances of sound and pitch frequency, allowing him to pick up numerous sounds, including both infra- and ultra-sound, from immense distances. In his youth, this, along with his enhanced vision, greatly overwhelmed him until he eventually learned to control it. Honing his senses, he has enough control to block out ambient sounds to focus on a specific source or frequency. Later in life, Clark was able to passively pick up the sound of Alfred Pennyworth's voice in Bruce Wayne's earpiece, as well as hear Calvin Swanwick and Emil Hamilton's conversation and heartbeats from within a soundproof interrogation cell. Clark heard Martha Kent in distress at the Kent farm from miles away and even heard Lois Lane drowning over the noise of his ferocious battle with Doomsday.
Superhuman smell: Superman has incredibly acute olfactory senses, as he was able to detect the distinct saline odor of the Genesis Chamber on Scout Ship 0344, despite the very thick barrier that separated him from it.
Abilities
Genius-level intellect: Clark Kent is extremely intelligent, as shown when he won a science fair at age 9 and could later be seen reading The Republic of Plato, a highly complex piece of historical literature (concerning philosophy and political science), when he was only 13, effectively making him a wunderkind prodigy. As an adult, Clark managed to successfully falsify his identity, and stay hidden as he traveled the world for many years, with even the extremely skilled reporter Lois Lane needing weeks of research to track him down. Clark also displayed basic medical knowledge when cauterizing Lois Lane's wound, and could instinctively tell that General Zod couldn't be trusted, based on his past criminal actions during the Kryptonian Civil War (revealed to him by Jor-El) and threat against humanity. As an investigative reporter, Clark is considered a "nerd" by Perry White, managing to twice receive the Elliot Prize for Investigative Journalism after only a year at the Daily Planet (the first of any of the reporters on the Daily Planet staff to earn so quickly), and was swiftly able to deduce that Batman targeted poorer areas in Gotham City, and his aid from the city's police in his anti-crime crusade. Superman's brilliant intellect extends itself to his exceptional science, writing, investigative reporting, leadership, and tactical skills. However, Superman is notably not quite as intelligent as supergenius Lex Luthor, with the latter thereby successfully outsmarting and manipulating Superman into battling and almost killing Batman with a sophisticated ultimatum. It was shown that his intelligence has the potential to surpass Batman's, as he was able to defeat the Dark Knight in the long Knightmare.
Expert reporter:      Clark Kent interviewing Bruce Wayne   Clark Kent, as a reporter for the very famous and respected Daily Planet newspaper, is an exceptionally skilled investigative reporter, displaying remarkable insight and investigative skills right away after getting hired as a junior reporter, quickly climbing through the ranks. After only a year, Clark had already twice earned the Elliot Prize for Investigative Journalism (the first of any of the Planet's reporters to earn such prestige so quickly), and was considered a "nerd" by his boss Perry White, almost rivaling even his far more experienced girlfriend. His abilities as a reporter allowed him to successfully lead a school field trip to S.T.A.R. Labs, and to expertly interview Bruce Wayne, Kahina Ziri's neighbors, and Adriana Santos with objective non-confrontational questions. Indeed, Clark's prowess led him to believe that he could successfully undermine the vigilante Batman through the press, and was notably able to quickly deduce that Batman often targets poorer areas in Gotham, and that he is aided by the city's police in his anti-crime crusade.
Expert social intuit: Superman, as both Kal-El and Clark Kent, has a considerable degree of social confidence, making him highly talented in intuitively determining how to interact with others, gain their respect and get his point across with calmness, eloquence, and charisma. Even while inexperienced, Clark was able to gain many jobs during his years of soul-searching, knowing how to appeal to potential employers and coworkers (such as Chrissy), being well-liked by them despite his inaptitude in the jobs he took, and showed an ability to restrain himself from harming those who pissed him off, as shown by how he calmly confronts the obnoxious Ludlow (even when the latter insults and pours been over Clark's face), only destroying his truck when he wasn't around and remains calm to Byrne's insulting reprimanding (as the latter had just attempted to save his life). As an illustrious Daily Planet reporter, Clark became fully experienced in social interaction and capable of preventing his emotions from clouding his diplomatic demeanor, and was soon confident and able enough to successfully lead a school field trip to S.T.A.R. Labs, to level with his own boss Perry White despite his condescending demeanor regarding his decision to undermine Batman under the press, to diplomatically interview Kahina Ziri's neighbors, and later Adriana Santos with objective non-confrontational questions (controlling his dismay and rage regarding what he was trying to learn). Indeed, Clark was even able to not only maintain his diplomatic composure when interviewing billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne himself, but also begin to wear down the much more experienced and older man, somewhat successfully angering the usually calm Bruce by cordially expressing his views regarding Batman, unaware that Bruce was actually the fearsome vigilante, remaining calm even as Bruce coldly told him off and diplomatically responding to the latter's distasteful remarks about him as Superman (despite clearly being dismayed at the personal criticism) by reminding Bruce that most of the world doesn't share his opinion, even inciting a cold reaction from Bruce afterwards, who went as far as to compare it to his interactions with Joker, and proceed to diplomatically greet Lex despite his interference allowing Bruce to get away. As Superman, he also showed an uncommon amount of calm confidence when first revealing himself and surrendering over to General Swanwick, successfully convincing him that he wasn't a threat, was confident in his ability to get through to the enraged Batman (which he ultimately did by appealing to him to save his mother, successfully giving the vigilante pause, despite his expectance of ruses from Superman due to a previous nightmare he had regarding Superman becoming evil, and allowing Lois to fully reason with him), and even in his ability to address the US government in his broadcasted hearing and convince everyone of his selfless intentions (which was deemed by even supergenius Lex Luthor himself as a threat to his plans to expose him as a fraud and saw the need to egregiously sabotage the hearing and rob Superman of his ability to speak at it).
Expert tactician: Superman has proven himself a very capable tactician in combat, as when facing off with the far more skilled and experienced Faora-Ul and Nam-Ek, he took advantage of the powers he had mastered, that they had yet to develop (flight and heat vision primarily), and ultimately defeated Faora when taking her by surprise and destroying her solar visor to expose her to a sensory overload, rendering her helpless. During his battle with General Zod, aware the latter's intentions to kill the entire human race, Superman was able to quickly come up with several ways to keep him away from innocent bystanders to limit the damage their battle would cause as much as possible - knocking Zod up to into an unoccupied construction site, keeping him airborne and above the city with repeated strikes, grappling and tossing him into outer space, and ultimately restraining him in a headlock to keep General Zod from causing any more harm (though Zod subsequently forced Superman to kill him then). Superman was even able to think his way out of the sophisticated ultimatum of supergenius Lex Luthor by holding back and allowing Batman to best him to give him the opportunity to reason with him, successfully avoiding having to kill the vigilante while rescuing his mother. During his battle with Doomsday, after taking the monster into outer space, Superman immediately recognized the nuclear missile shot at them, and took the opportunity to hold the monster into place so that it could be destroyed by the weapon. However, when that failed, Superman recalled the kryptonite spear's deadly effects on Kryptonian physiology (with that allowing Batman to beat him in their recent fight) and successfully utilized it to kill Doomsday after realizing that brute force alone wasn't enough to defeat the ever-evolving monstrous juggernaut, although he also lost his life in the process. Following his revival, Superman helped the Justice League defeat Steppenwolf, by personally freezing the New God's Electro Axe with his Arctic Breath in order to render it brittle, before allowing Wonder Woman to swiftly shatter it into pieces with her Sword of Athena, thus effectively depriving the New God of his weapon, leaving him defenseless. Superman's evil version (in Batman's nightmare vision of a possible future) displayed much greater strategical warfare abilities, to the point where he was able to successfully pressure Batman's Insurgency with his Regime in their lengthy war and eventually dealt them a crushing defeat.
Expert leader:      Superman leading the Regime   Superman has a natural talent in leadership, with even the much more experienced Batman admitting to Alfred that Superman would have done a better job bringing the Justice League together than he ever could. This proved true, as the remaining Leaguers looked up to Superman when he arrived on the scene of the final battle against Steppenwolf's invasion, with Superman thus taking up the leadership position from Batman. Superman's evil version indeed proved to be an exceptional leader, even greater than Batman (albeit a totalitarian one), having been able to found and lead his Regime to victory in the lengthy war against Batman's Insurgency (in a vision of a possible future), inspiring fierce loyalty in them to the point that the Regime Stormtroopers would always reverently kneel when their leader arrived, although it is worth mentioning that he had the advantage of superior military power to Batman.
Bilingualism: Superman, apart from his native English, also understands Spanish enough to comprehend the Spanish news coverage of a girl trapped in a burning house.

Expert leader:      Superman leading the Regime   Superman has a natural talent in leadership, with even the much more experienced Batman admitting to Alfred that Superman would have done a better job bringing the Justice League together than he ever could. This proved true, as the remaining Leaguers looked up to Superman when he arrived on the scene of the final battle against Steppenwolf's invasion, with Superman thus taking up the leadership position from Batman. Superman's evil version indeed proved to be an exceptional leader, even greater than Batman (albeit a totalitarian one), having been able to found and lead his Regime to victory in the lengthy war against Batman's Insurgency (in a vision of a possible future), inspiring fierce loyalty in them to the point that the Regime Stormtroopers would always reverently kneel when their leader arrived, although it is worth mentioning that he had the advantage of superior military power to Batman.
Superman leading the Regime
Bilingualism: Superman, apart from his native English, also understands Spanish enough to comprehend the Spanish news coverage of a girl trapped in a burning house.
Skilled combatant: Despite not having any formal combat training, Clark is a formidable fighter when facing most opponents due to his tremendous strength and various powers. When facing other Kryptonians with more combat experience, Clark is shown to be an improvisational learner and an effective brawler. As such, when facing the combined might of Faora-Ul and Nam-Ek, he was able to use the powers not yet acquired by either of them to his advantage, allowing him to gain the upper hand and forcing them to retreat, swiftly knocking out Nam-Ek and eventually breaking the Faora's visor. Later, Superman displayed improved skill to compete with General Zod reasonably well, as although he was still unable to match him in skill, he was able to fight almost evenly with the General, blocking a fair share of Zod's blows and landing his own punishing blows, ultimately holding on long enough for Zod to become briefly distracted to best him. As Superman gained more experience as a superhero, he became considerably more skilled, as shown when despite being weakened by a kryptonite gas grenade and pitted against the highly skilled Batman, Superman still temporarily stood up to his opponent despite being visibly outmatched by the Dark Knight's far more superior experience, and once his powers had began to return, even briefly dominated the Dark Knight, ultimately holding on long enough for his powers to return. His fighting skills also allowed him to single-handedly contend with the even stronger monstrous juggernaut Doomsday and even overpower him long enough to restrain him in order to have both of them hit by a 300 kiloton nuke. After his revival, Superman used his superior godly physical abilities to overpower the Justice League with only mediocre effort, launching Aquaman off the fight with a single mighty blow before he could attack him and swiftly pushing back Wonder Woman armed with her shield before proceeding to repel her attempts to restrain him with the Lasso of Hestia and pull her to him while also easily blocking an attempted flank from Aquaman and Cyborg. Despite the Flash's slightly greater speed, Superman was able to quickly overwhelm and knock him out after proving impervious to his attempts to freeze him and pushing aside the other members of the Justice League, glancingly hitting him after the Flash barely dodged his previous attacks. In his resulting altercation with Wonder Woman, although he did have a bit more difficulty fighting her, having been headbutted after landing a similar blow to her upon intercepting her attempt to clasp her Bracelets of Submission, he quickly grounded her with a single attack before easily tossing aside and restraining Batman with a single hand. He would have eventually killed them had Lois not stopped him. During the battle with Steppenwolf, Superman was the only member of the Justice League able to overpower him and did so with ease, easily dodging his blows and swiftly responding with his own punishing blows that quickly beat the New God to submission.</p></html>
