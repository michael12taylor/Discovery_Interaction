Bruce Wayne is the CEO of Wayne Enterprises and the main vigilante operating in Gotham City, New Jersey known as the Batman. After witnessing the murder of his parents at the hands of a mugger as a child, Bruce waged a war on crime in Gotham City for over 20 years before the Black Zero Event. He also serves as the leader of the Justice League which he co-founded alongside Wonder Woman.

Over the years, Bruce encountered numerous foes, most notably his archenemy Joker. Batman mentored the young Dick Grayson as his partner Robin, but he was tragically murdered by Joker and his doctor-turned-partner, Harley Quinn. Batman later apprehended Deadshot and Harley, and chased an up-and-coming Killer Croc out of Gotham during his attempt to form yet another criminal empire in the city. At some point he also came to blows with the mercenary Deathstroke, with the latter striving to destroy him. He also faced and defeated other minor villains such as Firefly, Penguin and the Riddler. After the death of Robin and the immense destruction and loss of life he personally witnessed during the Black Zero Event, Bruce became an increasingly ruthless guardian of Gotham City, as criminals grew wary of his now brutal reputation.

By 2015, a year and a half following the Black Zero Event, Bruce had become weary of the intentions of Superman, developing a hatred of the hero further fueled by the Machiavellian manipulations of LexCorp CEO and super genius Lex Luthor. His fear and rage would boil over when he exchanged blows with Superman, using his technology and resources to not only match Superman's strength, but counter the powers and even weaken him with kryptonite he had obtained and formed into a weapon should he want to kill him. However, Bruce would ultimately realize the error of his ways, and allied himself with Superman to save Martha Kent from Anatoli Knyazev. The two were later joined by Wonder Woman to defeat the Kryptonian behemoth Doomsday created by Lex Luthor, though the battle cost Superman his life. 

In the following year, Bruce learned of an impending threat coming to Earth. Meeting with Diana Prince, Bruce relayed his findings but discovered that his suspicions had already been confirmed, as the New God Steppenwolf had already arrived. Bruce then decided to recruit the metahuman candidates he and Diana had been observing from Luthor's files, realizing that an attack was imminent. With the formation of the Justice League, Bruce orchestrated a plan with the help of three superpowered beings, Arthur Curry, Barry Allen and Victor Stone, to resurrect Superman by utilizing the power of a Mother Box to jump-start the hero's regeneration process and revive him. With the team now fully established, Batman led a successful offensive against Steppenwolf, defeating the latter's invasion. 

Afterward, Batman continued to fight crime in Gotham while focusing his efforts on the team's future. Sometime later, he came into contact with the Martian Manhunter, who warned him of a future potential counterattack by the forces of Darkseid following Steppenwolf's failure.

Biography
Childhood
Bruce with his parents
Bruce Wayne was born on February 19, 1972[citation needed], in Gotham City, New Jersey, to Thomas and Martha Wayne. Bruce had an idyllic childhood due to his family's fortune and the love supplied by his parents. Growing up, he would be sat down on the floor of Wayne Manor's entrance room by his father, who told him that despite the manor itself being built on railways, real estates, and oil, the first generation of Waynes made their fortune as hunters, trading pelts and skins with the French.

Losing His Parents
Bruce witnessing his parents' murder.
One day in 1981, when Bruce was 9, he and his parents were walking home from the Aragon Theatre after seeing The Mark of Zorro when they were confronted by mugger Joe Chill. While seemingly hesitant, Thomas Wayne threw the first punch, attempting to beat back the mugger, but he was quickly shot and mortally wounded. Stunned, his mother joined the fight, attempting to wrestle the gun away. Her attempt also failed, leading to a sad look of surrender come upon her eyes right before she was shot herself, Bruce screaming in horror. With his last dying breath, Bruce's father called out his mother's name in a loud whisper, reaching out for the final time. Watching her life pass away even as the mugger ran off into the night. From then on, Bruce was raised by the Wayne family's butler, Alfred Pennyworth.

Bruce falling into the Batcave
During the funeral for his parents, Bruce, overcome with grief, broke away from the service. As he ran, he stumbled across a decrepit area of the estate and fell into a cavern filled with numerous bats. This would later inspire him to use that fear to battle the criminal elements that took his parents' lives.

Becoming the Batman
In the following years, Bruce grew up inspired to make himself a symbol of fear within the heart of crime in Gotham City. He did so by training himself beyond the heights of mental and physical perfection, mastering many martial arts, the art of deception, tactical skills, and stealth, among many other disciplines. In 1993, Bruce used his newfound discipline to take up the persona of a fearsome vigilante known as the "Batman" by launching a one-man war on crime at 21, while also swiftly reclaiming control over his family company Wayne Enterprises as its CEO. The cavern with bats that he had once fallen into as a child inspired him to create the Batcave, an expansive subterranean headquarters housing all of his high-tech Batman gadgets, located near Wayne Manor.

Crusade against crime
Bruce spent 20 years (up until the alien invasion of General Zod) fighting his way through the streets of Gotham City as the Batman. Bruce also started using a car known as the Batmobile during his time as Batman.

Bruce's morals often prevented him from killing his foes, meaning that most of Gotham City's supervillains often ended up incarcerated in either Blackgate Penitentiary or Arkham Asylum. Examples of Batman's enemies include members of both the Falcone and Maroni crime families, the monstrous metahuman Killer Croc, his psychopathic nemesis the Joker, Joker's girlfriend and right-hand woman Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Riddler, Penguin, and Deathstroke. Ultimately, the Joker would remain his greatest opponent. Although Batman once managed to defeat and capture Joker, sending him to Arkham Asylum, Joker would quickly be active again. Also, Batman would encounter several shady women during his career, as he would later compare to Diana Prince.

Bruce would also ally with GCPD officer James Gordon, and a Bat Signal projector was used to summon the Batman if the hero's vigilantism was ever urgently needed to defend the city. However, some of the GCPD's officers were adamantly against the idea of Batman, fearing and believing him to be a ruthless criminal, on whom they will often open fire, though these would eventually become the minority among the GCPD. Batman also adopted Dick Grayson, and trained him as his vigilante partner Robin, coming to see the younger man like a son. 

Overall, Batman was initially about finesse, fully employing his immensely formidable skills of stealth and deception, hardly openly appearing at all, as evidenced when he caught Sal and tied him up from a tall building, and broke Pete Doumanian's legs, forcing the latter to permanently retire from crime. Indeed, Batman was so successful in his stealthily deceitful method, that even after his 18 years of protecting Gotham City, there was hardly any tangible evidence of his existence, with some (notably Victor Stone) even assuming that Batman did not actually exist, and was nothing but an urban legend.

Death of Robin
Bruce at the display of his fallen ally
At some point before the Black Zero Event, the Joker and Harley Quinn managed to capture and kill Robin, leaving a sadistic note spray-painted in yellow for Batman on the damaged Robin suit. A devastated Bruce hung Robin's suit in the Batcave as a monument to honor his legacy and to remind himself of what he fights for. After the death of his protege, sidekick, and friend, Bruce became much more hardened and angered, morphing into a more relentless and violent version of Batman. Batman, in his anger at Joker for killing Robin, broke his teeth and once again defeated and sent him back to Arkham Asylum.

Capturing Deadshot
Batman confronts Deadshot
At some point during Bruce's career as a vigilante, Batman began tracking down Deadshot, the world's most wanted hitman, with the assistance of ARGUS leader Amanda Waller. With Waller's anonymous help, Batman finds Deadshot on the streets with his daughter Zoe Lawton. When Deadshot and his daughter were walking through an alley together, Batman attempted to seize Deadshot and told him to surrender so that he didn't have to use force in front of Zoe. Deadshot still attempts to fight off the vigilante, but Batman swiftly gets the better of him, beating Deadshot to the ground. Deadshot then promptly takes out his gun and attempts to shoot Batman, but Zoe stands in the way and begs her father not to kill anyone else. After a moment of reflection, Deadshot surrenders his gun as well as himself to Batman, who cuffs him to a gate and leaves him for the GCPD, who find him being hugged by a saddened Zoe.

Killer Croc on the run
The fierce crocodilian metahuman Waylon Jones came to Gotham City and tried to form a criminal enterprise. However, he was repeatedly confronted and defeated by Batman multiple times. Croc was so heavily on Batman's radar, that he was forced to flee the city, only to be later captured by Amanda Waller and her ARGUS SWAT team.

Black Zero Event
Black Zero Event
Bruce witnesses the destruction caused by Superman and Dru-Zod
Bruce was in Metropolis in the midst of General Dru-Zod's attack on the city with the Black Zero. As Zod attempted to terraform the Earth into a new Krypton, starting with Metropolis, Bruce took a helicopter to the outskirts of the city and witnessed the Black Zero destroying everything downtown. He took a Wayne Enterprises security vehicle and made his way towards the Wayne Financial building, giving the order via phone to the people inside to evacuate. Bruce's friend and employee Jack O'Dwyer relayed the order but failed to escape the building himself. Bruce dodged several falling pieces of debris from buildings and jets before finally reaching a stop in front of an entire crowd of citizens. Bruce exited the vehicle and watched along with the crowd as the Black Zero was destroyed and sent back to the Phantom Zone with Superman's infant starship. As buildings began to fall, Bruce made his way to Wayne Financial on foot and attempted to call Jack again, but got no signal. While there, he bore witness to the vicious duel between Superman and Zod.

Bruce watches as Superman fights Zod
As the mighty aliens fought high above the city, Zod's heat vision tore through the Wayne Financial building, causing it to collapse into ruins. A horrified Bruce screamed for Jack and ran towards the collapsing building while everyone else fled. Bruce searched for survivors, passing a group of frightened children and finding his employee Wallace Keefe trapped underneath the rubble. Bruce and a few other employees there helped rescue the now paralyzed Keefe. Bruce then noticed a little girl staring at the building's ruins and saved her from getting crushed by debris. He told her that she would be safe and asked where her mother was, but she could only point to the now-destroyed building before breaking down in tears. Bruce embraced and consoled the girl as he watched Zod and Superman continue their fight in the sky, coming crashing back down to Earth in a mortal embrace.

Defeating Firefly
Gradually, as a result of witnessing the incredible destruction and carnage unleashed by the Black Zero and subsequent duel of the mighty aliens, Bruce started becoming more brutal as Batman, now resorting to breaking the legs of jewel thief Pete Doumanian, for instance, though he still refused to kill the thugs that he apprehended.

Batman intervening in Firefly's operation
Months later, Batman intervened when the pyromaniac criminal Firefly was setting up charges to detonate a building. He used a batarang to knock the detonator from the villain's grip, destroying it with a stomp and proceeded to engage Firefly, who unsuccessfully attacked the Dark Knight with his flamethrower, as it proved ineffective against Batman's fireproof cape and oxygen mask. Batman then subdued him, leaving Firefly's two low-level criminal allies tied up on a sidewalk for the GCPD officers to find, though, unknown to him, Batman was being watched by Lex Luthor the entire time via a CCTV camera in order to analyze the Dark Knight's capabilities, which firmly established to Lex that the rumors of Batman being inhuman and supernatural are actually completely false.

Wayne Enterprises field trip
While at Wayne Enterprises, Bruce followed a Metropolis Middle School student, Zoe, who was watching a group of criminals using Kryptonian armor and plasma rifles, into a restricted section of the building. He urged her to return to her group, as he would seek the "proper authority", but they were caught by the gang. Suddenly, Superman showed up, causing the criminals to make a break for it, using the Kryptonian plasma rifles briefly to hold Superman back. Bruce then took down the guard watching him and Zoe, before activating a Kryptonian signal jammer, which let out a high-frequency screeching noise that subdued everybody, briefly including Superman. Given the opportunity to take out the criminals, Superman handed them over to the Metropolis Police Department, as Bruce praised Zoe for her courage, before returning her to her school group.

Locating Emily for evidence
Batman confronts Emily
As Batman, Bruce was later chasing a group through the Carytown Crossing, and shopping district. He landed his motorbike on top of their car, causing them to crash, before subduing and tying them up. He ran from the scene, disappearing down a manhole. The following night, he located Emily, who had taken a photo of him. He acknowledged that she would do the right thing and destroy the evidence, disappearing into the night.

Capturing Harley Quinn
Batman on the Smiley Car.
Soon after, the Joker and Harley Quinn were joyriding down a Gotham City street in the Smiley Car, laughing maniacally. However, Batman pursued them in the Batmobile and quickly mounted onto the roof of the vehicle. Harley annoyed that Batman was ruining "date night", shoots her firearm through the roof, though ineffective against Batman's bulletproof suit. Joker, attempting to shake Batman off, made a sharp turn that sent the vehicle flying off the road and into the river. Batman then promptly put on a re-breather and dove after the car, finding the crashed car and Harley, but no Joker. Batman then grabbed Harley, who awoke and tried to stab him, but Batman quickly knocks her unconscious with a mighty punch and carries her out of the river.

Batman carries Harley to the Batmobile
Batman then laid her on the hood of the Batmobile and checked for a pulse but couldn't seem to find one. With extreme reluctance, Batman then attempts oral resuscitation to revive her. A pleased Harley then begins kissing him, but Batman restrains and drives her to Arkham. ARGUS Director Amanda Waller then promptly had Harley transferred to Belle Reve supermax, where the female psychopath was eventually put inside a small electrified barbwire cage fit for her aerial acrobatic routines.

Man vs. God
Bat Brand of justice
An officer sees Batman for the first time
Two years after the Black Zero Event, Batman rescued a group of young Asian women from sex trafficker Cesar Santos by subduing him and then brutally interrogating him. One of the GCPD's rookie police officers interrupted his interrogation, frightened by the sight of the Batman perched on a wall and attempted to shoot him, but the Dark Knight swiftly fled, leaving Santos with a "bat-brand" on his chest. This would be only one of the many criminals branded by the Dark Knight (a total of 18 reports of similar occurrences in Gotham) within the last month before the incident. Soon, bearing a "bat-brand" became the equivalent to a death sentence among Gotham City prison inmates, and later among Metropolis prisoners too, as orchestrated by Lex Luthor to make Batman feel responsible for the deaths, as if he were a murderer, thus furthering Batman's grief.

The White Portuguese
Bruce discussing the White Portuguese with Alfred
Bruce had been seemingly searching for a target known only as of the White Portuguese, which, as he tells Alfred Pennyworth, is bringing in a dirty bomb to Gotham. Bruce learned that a Russian mercenary named Anatoli Knyazev may have information regarding the White Portuguese, but even after interrogating six people as the Batman, he learned nothing.

Hence, Bruce Wayne later attended an underground fight club where he met Knyazev, engaging in a brief conversation which allowed Bruce to clone Knyazev's phone and discover that Knyazev was employed by Lex Luthor. Bruce then expressed his intention to break into Luthor's house as Batman, but Alfred is quick to point out that that wouldn't be unnecessary as Luthor has already invited Bruce to attend a fundraiser event. On the evening of November 1, as Bruce prepares to depart the Batcave and attend the event, he stood before the monument for Robin's damaged Robin suit.

Meeting Clark Kent
Bruce plugging his hacking device in
Bruce attended Luthor's party intending to find as much evidence against Lex as possible. While pretending to listen to Lex Luthor's greeting speech, Bruce was guided by Alfred via a hidden earpiece, and snuck away from the crowd, successfully plugging in his device into the LexCorp servers housed in Luthor's lower levels. Unbeknownst to Bruce, however, Alfred's voice was picked up by the Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent, so, as soon as Bruce returns, a suspicious Clark is quick to interview him, asking Bruce about his position regarding Batman.

Clark Kent and Bruce meet for the first time.
Bruce initially attempts to brush the reporter off, condescendingly referring to the younger man as "son", and sarcastically asking if the Daily Planet belongs to him. Clark persists, claiming to have personally seen how Batman considers himself to be above the law and causing civilians to live in fear, despite having never seen Batman in action. Bruce is quick to point out the hypocrisy in Clark's words, noting that every time Superman carried out a trivial deed, journalists like Clark are quick to shower him with praise, and instead argues the godlike alien should instead be feared, as there would be seemingly no way of stopping him, if Superman were to suddenly decided to go bad. Clark is angered by this unexpected and personal criticism, but calmly points out that most of the world doesn't share Bruce's opinion on the alien superhero, but Bruce responds by claiming that perhaps his view is based on the bad history that Gotham has with "freaks dressed like clowns."

Bruce discovers his device is missing.
At that moment, however, the two were interrupted by the timely arrival of Lex Luthor, who enthusiastically introduced himself to Clark and invited Bruce to visit LexCorp Industries' Research and Development facilities. However, Mercy Graves arrives, letting Lex know that a governor wanted to speak with him. As Bruce politely excuses himself and walks off, a suspicious Clark attempts to follow him, having heard Alfred's voice in the earpiece again, but he is stopped when he sees a news report of a girl stuck in a burning house in Mexico, choosing instead to depart. Bruce then broke from the crowd to retrieve his mole, only to find it had been stolen by a mysterious woman. Bruce quickly pursued her, but she can leave the party before he can confront her.

Meeting Diana Prince
Bruce speaks with Diana
Later, Bruce tracked down Diana Prince at the Gotham City Museum of Antiquities, where an exhibit of a fake replica of Alexander the Great's sword, where he confronted her about the information she stole. Bruce claimed to see right through her "babe in the woods" act, saying that while she doesn't know him, he'd met "a few women like [Diana]". Diana, however, calmly smiled and reassures Bruce that he's never met a woman like her. She then proceeded to tell Bruce that she was unable to obtain anything due to the data having military-grade encryption. Diana also explained that she stole the information because Lex Luthor had stolen something of hers. Before excusing herself, Diana informed Bruce know that she was only borrowing his device, and had already returned it to him shortly beforehand, placing it into his car.

Insurgency nightmare
Batman being overwhelmed by Superman's stormtroopers and Parademons.
Bruce returned to the Batcave later that evening and placed drive into the Batcomputer, utilizing the Oracle Network to decrypt it. While patiently waiting for the slow decryption process, Bruce eventually fell asleep at his desk.

Bruce began to experience a vision of a post-apocalyptic 2022 - the product of an ongoing Knightmare - in which a devastated Superman killed millions, driven by his despair over the loss of Lois Lane, becoming dark and malevolent. Bruce saw himself leading a revolution against Superman's regime, attempting to find kryptonite to kill him. He was then captured and confronted Superman a final time, before the Man of Steel brutally killed him by tearing out his heart.

Future Flash appears to Bruce
Shocked awake, Bruce found a distorted and unstable blue portal of energy beside him. From it, the Flash appeared and gave Bruce an incoherent warning to fear Clark's power (whom Bruce had "always been right about") and that Lois Lane was "the key" to this. Flash then suddenly realized that he was too soon in the timestream, so he begged Bruce to find "them" and save "her." Bruce abruptly awoke again, though he wasn't sure if either experience was entirely a dream.

This terrifying vision of a potential future, along with Bruce choosing to interpret that the male individual whom Flash implored him to fear is Superman, ridded Bruce of any doubts he might have still had, giving more justification to his quest of bringing down Superman.

Motives explained
Having awoken from his nightmare, Bruce examines the encrypted data and realizes that Lex Luthor is not only experimenting with kryptonite, but also investigating metahumans. One of them is Diana Prince herself, who is revealed to be an immortal Amazon warrior Wonder Woman (as a photo of her together with Steve Trevor's team in World War I Belgium is seen). The others are the mysterious mighty Atlantean warrior Arthur Curry, the powerful speedster Barry Allen, and the cybernetically enhanced Victor Stone. In the process, Bruce also realizes that the "White Portuguese" is a ship, rather than a person. Bruce then promptly admits to Alfred that he plans to steal the kryptonite to weaponize it, should it become necessary to fight Superman. 

Bruce, explaining himself to Alfred
Dismayed, Alfred insisted Bruce was misled, as Superman hadn't been either theirs or humanity's enemy. Cynically, Bruce responded, recognizing that while Superman may not be an enemy just yet, Bruce had, during his 20 years of being the Batman in Gotham, seen "what promises are worth"; having laid witness to many seemingly benevolent individuals become malevolently corrupted to the point that Bruce claimed that hardly any good guys are left. He further persists that if there was more than a one percent chance of Superman's corruption, it needed to be addressed immediately. Also, Bruce personally witnessed the other Kryptonians who arrived on Earth attempt to wipe out all life on the planet. As a result, Batman adopted the perception of Kryptonians as having a natural predisposition towards evil, and he thus feared the possibility of General Dru-Zod's level of evil gradually developing in the only other member of the alien race still to be on Earth: Superman. Alfred, seeing how determined and set Bruce is, remained silent as the latter walked away.

First encounter with Superman
Batman watching Lex Luthor's men
Superman threatens Batman
While intercepting Lex Luthor's men transporting kryptonite, Superman interrupted the chase, damaging the Batmobile after Batman tried running him down and again when Superman tore the doors off. Superman (enraged by the death of Cesar Santos and the helplessness of using words to stop Batman's vigilantism) threatened the Dark Knight, warning him to give up his crusade (to ignore the Bat-Signal the next time it is shined into the sky), and that he should consider Superman's warning mercy, meaning that disobedience will carry severe punishment. As he turned to leave, Batman countered with a threat of his own, expressing his determination to make the godlike alien "bleed". Not impressed with Batman's threat, Superman flew off, while Batman promptly drove back to the Batcave in the damaged Batmobile. Back home, Batman tracked the kryptonite to LexCorp Industries, intending to steal it from there shortly thereafter.

The US Capitol bombing
Bruce, seething with renewed horror and rage after witnessing the Capitol explosion
Mere days later, Bruce is at Wayne Enterprises Headquarters when sees on TV how his former employee Wallace Keefe publicly expresses disdain against Superman, in light of him being present for the upcoming congressional hearing regarding Superman's involvement in the Nairomi incident, during which Wallace went as far as to say that he has nothing, causing Bruce to realize that Wallace definitely hasn't received the fund monthly checks that his company has given out to any of the victims from his comment. Shocked and saddened to learn that his company had seemingly abandoned a victim of Superman, Bruce immediately requests that his assistant Grace summon his other employee, Greg, and when she does, Bruce demands to know why Wallace had clearly not been receiving the victims' fund monthly checks that Wayne Enterprises had been paying out. Greg reveals that Wallace had actually been rejecting them all, and sending them back, leaving hateful messages written on them in red, further horrifying Bruce.

As Bruce inspects the messages, getting more angry the more he reads, which read "Bruce Wayne - open your eyes", "Bruce Wayne - I am your ghost", "Bruce no truce", "Bruce Wayne I will haunt you", and "Bruce Wayne = Blind". Bruce's immense dismay and rage reached it's peak a few moments later, when he witnessed the massive US Capitol explosion during Superman's congressional hearing, seemingly caused by Superman himself (actually malevolently orchestrated by Lex Luthor to frame him, with Lex also having rejected the funds and send them back with the hate mail) as he reads an old newspaper that Wallace seemingly send back to Bruce - an article which detailed the deaths of dozens Wayne Enterprises employees in the Black Zero Event, having "You let your family die" written on it, in the same red ink. 

Later that evening, induced by the red notes and recent events to finally take offensive action against Superman, Batman breaks into the well-guarded LexCorp Industries building, successfully steals the kryptonite from within, while seriously injuring all of the guards (swooping down on them from above, like an actual bat) despite their tireless attempts to shoot him (evidenced by the numerous cartridges lying on the floor in the aftermath), leaving a batarang in the empty kryptonite container (for Lex to see), as well as a considerable trail of destruction.

Preparation for fighting Superman
Bruce, observing his invented kryptonite weapon
With his experienced engineering genius, Bruce is able to swiftly invent and construct two effective anti-Superman weapons with Lex's kryptonite - first using a laser to cut the xenomineral into a large spearhead (later constructing the thick shaft), and then gathering the leftover kryptonite dust into 3 gas grenades, all encased in lead (rendering the danger invisible to Superman).

Bruce's Batcave workout
In order to be at his absolute peak during the upcoming duel, Bruce also pushes his body to its physical limits with many intense workouts in his Batcave - dragging an extremely heavy truck tire from a considerable distance, hitting the aforementioned tire very hard with a huge sledgehammer numerous times, performing many pull-ups with extremely heavyweight plates chained to his dipping belt, bench-pressing more than a thousand pounds on a barbell, easily performing complex presses with extremely heavy dumbbells, and finally, pushing an already extremely heavy cart (loaded with dozens of large weight plates) for a large distance.

Bruce, grimly musing about his father and ancestors
With his physical preparation complete, Bruce retreats to mentally prepare at the abandoned Wayne Manor, where he is found by Alfred, who once more attempts to implore Bruce to stop, claiming that Batman cannot win such a confrontation, with it being "suicide". Bruce grimly responds saying that he is now older than his father Thomas Wayne had ever been, and that this might be the only thing Bruce does that actually matters, since despite Batman having defeated numerous Gotham City criminals and supervillains over the last 20 years, "criminals are like weeds", in that if 1 is pulled up, another grows in its place, while Superman has the potential to become the most formidable supervillain in history, so taking him down before that happens is "about the future of the world", something Bruce sees as "Batman's legacy". Bruce then grimly muses at how his father had once told him that despite the Wayne Manor itself being built on railways, real estates and oil, the first generation of Waynes had made their fortune as hunters, trading pelts and skins with the French. Thus, Bruce not only hopes to live up to his father by taking Superman down but also feels a kinship with his ancestors, as a hunter of sorts. This grim reasoning, coupled with the future Flash's message, absolutely cements Bruce's resolve. As Bruce walked away, Alfred, understanding that trying to stop the former is hopeless, bitterly remarked that "So falls the House of Wayne."

Sometime before heading out to face Superman, Bruce finally sends an e-mail to Diana Prince, letting her know that he has obtained the 1918 photograph of her and Steve Trevor's team, asking her with curiosity where else she has been during the last century (her status as an immortal metahuman clearly impressing Bruce), and also sharing with her the data that Lex Luthor had on the other metahumans - Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. Diana however, while intrigued, does not answer the e-mail, and proceeds with her plans to depart Metropolis for Paris, via a transitional flight to Turkey.

Batman activates the Bat-Signal
Now armed and fully prepared, Batman prepares his preemptive strike against Superman, building an extremely durable Armored Batsuit, and kryptonite powered arsenal. Batman then set up traps in the old Gotham City Police Department building, also placing a kryptonite spear in the ground for later use. Having prepared for the fight, Batman tore off the old cloth covering the Bat-Signal and turned it on, shining it into the thundery sky.

Duel with Superman
Batman and Superman meet face to face again
A reluctant Superman (having just been forced to comply with Lex Luthor's ultimatum) traveled to Gotham City to face Batman, who was prepared for him in the yard. Superman attempted to reason with him also revealing that he is aware of Batman's identity, but set off one of his traps, causing sonic emitters to boom at him, halting Superman for a few seconds.

Batman ready to fight Superman.
However, he destroys them and continued to reason with Batman, but it became clear he wasn't getting through to him (due to Batman suspected a deceitful ruse, due to the future Flash's warning of Batman having "always being right" about Superman), as another trap (with automated machine guns) is set off when Superman pushes Batman aside (sending the Dark Knight flying over 60 ft with just a light push), but Superman disposed of it quickly as well. An angered Superman then easily lifted Batman over his head with one arm, and sent him flying down the street again, after which he tackled Batman into the air, through a building, and onto its roof, hurling him right through the Bat-Signal.

Superman ordered the momentarily shocked and downed vigilante to stay down, letting Batman know that he has been holding back this whole time and that Batman would have already been dead, had Superman wanted to kill him. However, Batman promptly caught his breath, rises, and defiantly resumes the fight by throwing a smoke grenade between himself and Superman, momentarily vanishing out of sight. Using these few seconds to change his position, Batman gets behind Superman and fires a grenade at him, though the alien hero easily catches it. However, it then unexpectedly sprays kryptonite gas into Superman face, which severely weakens him, bringing Superman to his knees, finally leveling the vast difference in strength, allowing the armored Batman to physically engage Superman in a duel.

God vs Man
Batman taunts Superman as the latter grows weaker. Superman attempts to fight back, but Batman takes full advantage of Superman's now weakened state and his superior fighting skills, easily countering Superman's attacks and crashing through the skylight to the lower floor by stomping hard on a downed Superman.

However, Superman begins to recover from the kryptonite poisoning at this point, as he powerfully countered Batman's increasingly ineffectual attacks, even knocking him to the lower floor with a mighty tackle. As more of his strength and powers continued returning, Superman easily hurls Batman through multiple walls to the ground and charges at him, with Batman grabbing Superman in mid-air and slamming him against a wall, proceeding to punch him hard. However, more and more of Superman's powers return, so Batman's armored punches begin to lose effectiveness quickly. Signs of fear start to show on Batman's face, and Superman promptly tackles him to the ground, hurling Batman through multiple walls, to the ground again.

The effects of the kryptonite begin to wear off
As Batman sees Superman ready to charge at him again, he, in desperation, fires another kryptonite gas grenade at Superman, just as the latter was leaping into the attack. With his suit now damaged from the final attack, Batman grabs a bathroom sink and smashes it on the once again weakened Superman's head, knocking the latter unconscious.

Procuring victory
Batman triumphant over Superman
Batman lifted Superman by his hair and placed him over his shoulder, proceeding to carry him to the missing floor, where he threw Superman several stories down. Batman then grappled to the bottom himself and wrapped the wire from the gun around Superman's ankle. Picking up the grapple gun, Batman dragged Superman to the open area in the building. He deduced that Superman's parents taught him that he meant something and that he was there for a reason. However, Batman's parents taught him a different lesson. Batman activates a button on the gun, which yanks Superman towards him. Batman tosses him around the building, through the pillars. A badly defeated and wounded Superman lands on a pile of rubble and debris as Batman finishes telling him what his parents taught him, that the world only made sense "if you force it to". With that, Batman grabbed the spear and kicked Superman onto his back. He placed his foot on his throat, choking him, telling him that he was never a god or even a man. Batman then used the spear to cut across Superman's face (making good on his promise to make Superman "bleed"), and raised it, preparing to deliver the killing blow.

Epiphany and promise
Superman, begging Batman to save "Martha"
Superman, unable to escape, urged him to save "Martha", telling him that he has her and to find him, which caused Batman to mentally flashback to the night his parents died. He recalled how his his father had also called out the name "Martha" with his last dying breath. Confused and enraged, Batman demanded to know why Superman had said that name. At that precise moment, Lois Lane, having arrived by helicopter, rushed in and begged Batman to stop, telling him that Martha is the name of Superman's mother. Shocked, Batman came to his senses, finally realizing that Superman was a selfless person pleading for the life of his mother instead of his own instead of a monstrous alien threat. Furthermore, Batman saw the hypocrisy of his actions – that he has allowed Lex Luthor to twist his anger from the Black Zero Event and turn him into the very villain he swore to fight. Angered, ashamed and horrified at the monster that he had almost become, Batman hurled aside the spear in disgust and resolves to help Superman stop Lex Luthor, the true enemy.

Batman, shell-shocked after realizing the monster that he had nearly become
Superman and Lois then explain the situation to Batman, concerning Martha Kent's kidnapping by Lex Luthor, and her currently running out of time. Putting his tactical genius back to use, Batman insists that Superman to go back to Metropolis, while he would go after Martha, promising him that she wouldn't "die tonight".

The death of Superman
Saving Martha
Batman, battling Knyazev's men
Due to him having previously cloned Knyazev's phone, Alfred was able to help Batman track the Russian and his thugs down to an abandoned warehouse near the port of Gotham City by using the Batcomputer, which Batman promptly flies to in the Batwing. Very thankful for Alfred's help, Batman claims not to deserve him, to which Alfred responds affirmatively. After scanning the warehouse with the Batcomputer's thermal imaging, Alfred lets Batman know about two dozen armed thugs on the third floor, so he remote-pilots the Batwing, dropping Batman right underneath them, on the second floor. Catching the thugs off-guard by grappling upright through the wooden floor, Batman promptly disarms most of them and engages all but two in vicious hand-to-hand combat. Despite being quite tired from his recent battle with Superman, Batman incapacitates all of them swiftly and efficiently, brutally beating them to the ground and having two of them killed by a grenade.

Batman shielding Martha from the explosion
Upon making his way to the room Martha Kent was held in by Anatoli Knyazev and one of his thugs, Batman had a stand-off with Knyazev himself, who threatened to kill Martha. Batman said that he believed him, promptly shoots the Russian's flamethrower's tank, seemingly killing Knyazev. Batman, however, managed to shield Martha from the explosion with his fireproof cape, and attempted to calm her down, letting Martha know that he was a friend of her son. She, however, has already realized this, claiming that it was Batman's cape that let her know of his allegiance (due to it being somewhat similar to that of Superman). Batman flew off on his Batwing as soon as he saw the Gotham police approach, Martha, leaving her in safe hands.

Afterward, Lex Luthor called Anatoli to kill Martha, only for Batman to intercept the call and tell him he defeated Anatoli and his men and he was coming for Lex next.

Battling with Doomsday
The nuclear explosion that results in the missile hitting Superman and Doomsday is so gigantic, that Batman can see it from Earth's surface, just as he is flying toward the fight on his Batwing.

Batman in battle with Doomsday
Doomsday's body lands on the abandoned Stryker's Island, but he is far from dead, as the tremendous explosion and extremely high fall seem to have only made the monster stronger, with its body once again regenerating. Batman then joins in the Battle against Doomsday with his Batwing, unleashing an immense amount of firepower, but Doomsday is unscathed and brings the plane down with his heat vision and breath. Before Batman can escape his crashed vehicle, Doomsday corners him and fires a tremendous superheated torrent at him. Wonder Woman arrives, however, just in time to save Batman from certain death, deflecting the beams with her indestructible bracelets, which creates a massive wave of energy outwards.

Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman stand ready to face Doomsday
Shortly thereafter, a recovered Superman returns from space, tackles away Doomsday, and asks Batman if he'd found the kryptonite spear, to which the Dark Knight grimly replied that he had been "a little busy." While initially somewhat confused over who Wonder Woman is (incorrectly assuming at first that she was an ally of Batman's, that the latter had brought along), Superman proceeds to jointly attack Doomsday in tandem with her, while Batman keeps his distance, and persistently tries to expose the monster to kryptonite, which would exploit its only known weakness. He successfully hides behind some stone rubble at one point, avoiding Doomsday's electric shock-wave.

Batman after successfully shooting Doomsday with kryptonite
Taking advantage of Doomsday's limited intelligence and tremendous bloodlust, Batman baits him into charging at him (managing to grapple away just in time), successfully dodges an ensuing huge thermal blast from the monster, and lures it closer to Wonder Woman, allowing her to get her unbreakable Lasso of Hestia around Doomsday's torso. As she strains to hold the mighty monster in place, Batman fires his last kryptonite gas grenade at Doomsday, temporarily weakening him, and giving Superman to crucial opening the latter needed to stab the monster with the kryptonite spear.
Unfortunately, while the monster is mortally wounded, an enraged dying Doomsday manages to pierce Superman's chest with his huge arm-protrusion, mortally wounding him as well. Both combatants release one last thunderous bellow of agony before their lifeless and pierced bodies collapse.

Batman, mourning Superman in guilt-ridden silence
Batman is visibly shell-shocked and saddened (by Superman's unexpectedly human move, which yet again proved Batman's image of Superman wrong) and promptly retrieves Superman's lifeless body, enveloping him in his own cape, and giving the body to Wonder Woman, who places it on the ground, seconds before the arrival of a devastated Lois Lane. Lois proceeds cradle and weeps over the body of her beloved, as Batman and Wonder Woman stand next to her in respectful lamenting silence, though Batman in particular, as he becomes guilt-ridden about being so devastatingly wrong about Superman, whom he had ironically wanted to kill less than 2 hours earlier.
