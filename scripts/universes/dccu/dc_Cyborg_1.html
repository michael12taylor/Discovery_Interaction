Victor Stone is a former college athlete and football star. Following a horrific accident that resulted in the death of his mother, Victor was gravely injured and was extremely close to death. His father, Silas Stone, was able to save him via the use of a Mother Box that crafted cybernetics onto his body, managing to save his life but leaving him alienated and detached from the rest of humanity due to various complications with his new form. 

He would eventually be recruited by Wonder Woman to become a member of the Justice League, to help defend Earth against the imminent alien invasion of Steppenwolf and his Parademon army.

Shortly after joining the team, Victor assisted the Batman and the Flash in resurrecting Superman from the dead. With the team now fully assembled, Cyborg contributes to the successful offensive against Steppenwolf, forcing the alien invasion into retreat.  

Following this, Victor finally reveals himself to the world, officially becoming a superhero and nicknamed Cyborg, having further plans for the newly-founded Justice League alongside Batman.

Biography
Victor Stone prior to his accident
Childhood
Victor Stone was born on June 29, 1994, in Gotham City, New Jersey, to Dr. Silas Stone, a scientist at S.T.A.R. Labs, and his wife Elinore.

Football career
Victor attended Gotham City University, and played on the Gotham City Wildcats as a football quarterback. One night, he won a game for his mother while his father was absent. Silas' constant absences anger Victor leading into arguments with his mother.  

Car accident and becoming Cyborg
That same night, Victor and Elinore get themselves into a car accident resulting into the two's deaths. Although, Silas, the head of S.T.A.R. Labs, manages to "save" Victor's life using the Mother Box of man. However, rather than restoring his full body, the Mother Box transformed him into a Cyborg. 

Since then, Victor went into hiding and kept the Mother Box hidden at his apartment. Victor resents his father for being mostly absent in his life and for rebuilding him into a "monster" and blames him for Elinore's death. Silas leaves him a tape which Silas called "A Father Twice Over" that serves as guide on how to discover his newly-gained powers, which include the ability to remotely bypass encryption and manipulate computer systems at will, but Victor destroys the tape when the recording becomes more personal. Though Victor was "restored", he was declared dead to the public, with his tombstone reflecting his date of death as 2015.

Formation of the Justice League and fight against Steppenwolf


One night, after Silas was kidnapped by a parademon that was searching for a Mother Box, Victor joins Batman, and Wonder Woman's team of Metahumans to save him by breaking through the New God Steppenwolf's base of operations where he has already obtained 2 Mother Boxes from Themyscira and Atlantis and using them to form the Unity that would result in Earth's terraformation into Apokolips. Victor unveils the Box's abilities to the team which it can either restore or destroy life, calling it a "change machine". Inspired by this, the team decide to use the Box to revive Superman. 


Victor and Barry exhume Clark Kent's body from his grave and take it back to his ship in S.T.A.R. Labs where Victor and Barry activate the Mother Box and successfully revive Superman; while doing so, Victor gains a quick glimpse of the future in which Darkseid kills Diana, and Arthur while takes control of Superman. However, Superman becomes amnesic and attacks the team. Victor's armor responds back and attacks Superman with the team's help. Eventually, Lois Lane arrives and calms Superman down. Following this, Steppenwolf attacks S.T.A.R. Labs and retrieves the last Mother Box, which Silas placed a heat tracker on at the cost of his life. Victor tracks down the heat signature and also discover Steppenwolf's base using one of Bruce's six satellites. 


The team, later joined by a now mindful Superman, then formulate a plan to breakthrough Steppenwolf's base and break the Unity with Victor separating it and Barry assisting Victor. However, the plan fails when Barry is injured by a Parademon and the Unity forms, causing an explosion, killing the team. Just as the Unity causes the explosion, Barry uses his abilities to reverse time. When doing so, Victor enters a dreamstate where he sees himself with his parents alive as they attempt to convince Victor to stay in it, although Victor refuses and claims he is home and free as Cyborg.

Aftermath
Following the fight against Steppenwolf, Victor decides to remain on the team and listens to his father's recording again and further explores his abilities.

Conversation with Barry
At some point Victor had a conversation with Barry about the possibility of a multiverse which Victor stated was impossible.

Knightmare
Beginning of the end
Cyborg wields his weapons in the Knightmare future
At some point in a possible future, Lois Lane would be killed, with the Batman having been unable to prevent it. Consumed with grief, Superman was left susceptible to Darkseid's Anti-Life Equation and allied himself with the forces of Apokolips, becoming a dark, tyrannical ruler of the planet. Earth was successfully terraformed by the Mother Boxes and the Regime was founded to aid Superman in his totalitarian conquest of Earth, mercilessly killing anybody who opposed him. With his remaining Justice League allies, Cyborg and the Flash, the Batman promptly founded the Insurgency in order to combat this new threat, thus beginning a long conflict. Cyborg stood alongside the Batman to recruit the Joker to get a Mother Box to build the cosmic treadmill, a device capable of tearing holes in time when combined with the Flash's speed.

At some point during the conflict, Cyborg was mortally wounded, with his entire bottom half being shattered in some skirmish, causing the need for Flash to drag him everywhere.

The warning
After Batman was ambushed and killed by Superman, Barry and Victor got ready to put the Insurgency's backup plan into action. Cyborg gave Barry some rough calculations, and, with this knowledge, the Flash was able to use his cosmic treadmill to run back in time to warn Bruce Wayne of the dangers that Superman could pose. However, as Flash was journeying through time, some unknown event occurred that Victor was unable to prevent, and Barry was pulled violently from the timestream.

Personality
Before his tragic accident and cybernetic transformation, Victor Stone was an optimistic football enthusiast and academic overachiever, thus managing to gain a scholarship to Gotham City University.

After the accident, however, Victor abandons football and becomes gloomy, secluded, depressed, and even somewhat robotic. Cyborg can also be quite blunt and robotically stiff, sternly pointing out to a person that the latter should have moved out of the path of the Humvee flying right at him. This all stems from the fact that after becoming a cyborg, Victor no longer feels fully human, thinks of himself as a monster, and even Wonder Woman herself was initially unable to persuade him otherwise. However, when his father Silas Stone gets kidnapped by Steppenwolf, Cyborg joins the League without hesitation, and even personally attacks the fearsome New God to save him.

Despite his disillusionment with the world, Victor retains his selflessness after his accident, hacking into school databases and changing the grades of students who are suffering from family hardships prior to his transformation, and assisting a penniless single mother by manipulating her bank account as Cyborg.

After fighting alongside the Justice League for some time, however, Cyborg seems to have warmed a bit to all of his teammates, as he bonds a bit with Flash over their unexpected metahuman power gain (though he still found the latter's humor a bit annoying), he somewhat bonds with Batman over their engineering expertise, he notably reassures the previously skeptical Aquaman that "the ride ain't over yet" (before helping the Atlantean fight a group of Parademons), he comes to appreciate Wonder Woman's emotional support, and even shares a laugh of relief with resurrected Superman (after they successfully pry apart the 3 Mother Boxes). Indeed, Cyborg is the first member of the League to have befriended every single one of his teammates during their first major battle. Superman's return and the defeat of Steppenwolf finally grants Cyborg the confidence to reveal his cybernetic self to the world, and begin mending his strained relationship with his father, as he is seen beginning to work with Silas at S.T.A.R. Labs.

Powers and abilities
Powers
Technorganic physiology: After surviving a horrible accident and becoming a cybernetic organism with the help of an Apokoliptan Mother Box, Victor Stone has gained various superhuman abilities.

Superhuman strength: Cyborg's armored cybernetic body grants him considerable superhuman strength, making him the fourth-strongest member of the Justice League (after Superman, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman). Hence, Cyborg was able to easily stop and knock back a flying Humvee mid-air, smash right through the Knightcrawler's roof, as well as catch and hurl Aquaman 30 feet through the air, and he even helped Superman pry apart the 3 Mother Boxes with his bare hands, though doing so visibly strained Cyborg. However, Cyborg was no match for either Steppenwolf, though he was still strong enough to send him flying with a punch empowered by the recoil of his cannon, or an angry resurrected Superman, albeit he did briefly and barely held him back using the full force of his cybernatic body before being swiftly overpowered and pummeled.
Superhuman durability: Cyborg's cybernetic body is extremely durable, capable of withstanding immense blunt force trauma, as well as flight at extremely high altitudes. However, beings considerably stronger than him can still wound Cyborg, notably when resurrected Superman painfully beat Cyborg to the ground, and later when Steppenwolf cut through the former's shoulder with his battle-ax, and later tore off several of Cyborg's limbs.
Superhuman speed: While nowhere near as fast as Superman or the Flash, Cyborg is considerably faster than humans, with him able to appear and disappear in a blink of an eye.
Superhuman stamina: Cyborg has incredible stamina, with him never tiring or needing to sleep. Indeed, Cyborg doesn't need to consume food, or even breathe if he were to choose not to.
Superhuman reflexes: Due to the bio-cyber interface of his brain and nervous system, Cyborg possesses exceptional reflexes.
Longevity: Being more machine than flesh and blood, Victor is immune to aging and illnesses (although he is possibly susceptible to computer viruses), and has unlimited lifespan.
Self-modification:     Cyborg's automatic cybernetic modification  Cyborg's cybernetic body appears to be in a constant state of self-modification, which leads to him discovering new abilities every so often, suddenly learning one day that he could fly, for instance. He was also able to generate weapons and a Kryptonian command key.
Self-repairing: Cyborg, due to the Mother Box healing him, is capable of repairing his biomechatronic and regenerating his organic body parts if they become damaged. This way Victor notably managed to heal his body and regrow lost organic body parts with biomechatronic parts after his horrible accident, thereby becoming Cyborg. Even after Steppenwolf cut through his shoulder and tore off several of his limbs, Cyborg managed to recover and weld himself back together within minutes.
Plasma cannon: Cyborg can swiftly alter the shape of his arms into a cannon, which generates extremely powerful concussive blasts of blue-hot plasma. These blasts are powerful and hot enough to instantly disintegrate a huge piece of falling debris mid-air, and one blast was even able to momentarily hurt Steppenwolf himself. The cannon also managed to somewhat affect the resurrected Superman, knocking him back and causing him to grunt in annoyance.
Rocket launcher: Victor can just as spontaneously morph his left arm into a missile system, having done so on accident after integrating with the Mother Box. His defense systems having conjured it up in the presence of the revived Kryptonian.
Flight: Cyborg can achieve sustained flight, via thrusters located along his body, and can achieve great velocities. He also has a collapsible face plate which protects his organic part of his face when in flight.
Shield: Victor can morph his arms into a shield capable of withstanding and deflecting the heat vision from a revived Superman. He was only overwhelmed was by the sheer, continuous force of the beams, which only knocked him back.
Extra arms: Victor can manifest extra, cybernetic limbs for situations requiring greater strength or dexterity.

Extra arms: Victor can manifest extra, cybernetic limbs for situations requiring greater strength or dexterity.
Technology manipulation: Victor, as a cybernetic organism, can interface and control any system he has access to, allowing him to manipulate data seamlessly. He was able to access the highly sophisticated Batcomputer when attempting to communicate with Batman and Wonder Woman, and integrate with the Knightcrawler in the fight against Steppenwolf. He is even able to interface with advanced technology from other worlds, such as Scout Ship 0344 and the Mother Boxes. Cyborg remains constantly plugged into the Internet, taking in and processing vast amounts of code and data. However, Cyborg admits to not having fully mastered this power. He even has the ability to repair non-digital devices without even making any form of physical contact.
Holographic projection: Cyborg can make holographic projections of data that he discovers on the Internet.
Technological enhancement: Through his mechanical interfacing, Victor can bolster the efficiency of any mechanical or cybernetic apparatus he comes across. Such as he did with Bruce Wayne's Flying Fox when the former said it couldn't get to Russia in time to stop the terraforming.
Technology assimilation: Victor can integrate other pieces of technology, such new weapons, into himself to further increase the range of his own capabilities.

Technopathy: Cyborg can communicate with technology; he knew the Flying Fox could not take flight because of a software issue.
Abilities
Genius-level intellect: Victor Stone was already a genius before his accident, but his mind was enhanced even further after he became a cyborg, due to his mind absorbing vast amounts of data from being constantly connected to the Internet.
Master engineer: Cyborg, due to his technopathy, has become an engineering genius, even more so than Batman, with him therefore swiftly understanding how to use the Batcomputer and Knightcrawler, and when confronted by unfamiliar technology such as that on Scout Ship 0344 or the Unity, Cyborg can familiarize himself with it very quickly, hence he was quickly able to deduce Lex Luthor's process of creating Doomsday, as well as the upcoming process of resurrecting Superman with a Mother Box. As a result, his father Silas Stone consistently asked Cyborg to work with him and his scientists at S.T.A.R. Labs, which Cyborg eventually does.

Expert athlete: Victor Stone had originally been a highly skilled college athlete and football star before his horrible accident, even gaining a football scholarship to Gotham City University.
Stealth expertise: Cyborg, despite his mechanical body, is exceptionally stealthy, as he was able to spy on Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince from a distance, and later, along with Batman and Wonder Woman, was able to swiftly slip away when Commissioner James Gordon turned away for a moment, surprising even The Flash was left incredulous at how he didn't notice his teammates leave, despite having superhuman reflexes and standing right beside them.
Expert combatant: Although he has never received formal training, Cyborg is a skillful wrestler, able to defeat countless Parademons and even temporarily fight against the likes of Steppenwolf and Superman with the aid of his powers, though no match for either of them alone, as Steppenwolf had no trouble overpowering Cyborg and Cyborg's ability to score a hit on the New God was attributed to him working together with Wonder Woman and he only lasted for moments against Superman before being soundly tossed aside.
Master marksman: As a football star, Victor Stone was already skilled with target-based activities, and, with his technological enhancements improving this even further, Cyborg became a perfect shot on par with master marksmen like Deadshot, as he can accurately hone on a moving target's trajectory to shoot it out of the air, as done with numerous Parademons.
Equipment
Mother Box: Cyborg's main piece of equipment is an Apokoliptan Mother Box, which healed his damaged body, transforming him into a cybernetic organism. Due to his own horrid experience with it, Victor was determined to keep it hidden, despite his father Silas Stone's protests, only agreeing to retrieve it to help resurrecting Superman.

Trivia
His origin portrayed in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was heavily inspired by the character's arc in Geoff Johns' Justice League run during The New 52.
This is the second live-action portrayal of Cyborg. The first was by the late Lee Thompson Young on The CW's Smallville series.
However, this is the first time he's appeared on the silver screen.
However, this is the first time he's appeared on the silver screen.
He is currently the youngest member of the Justice League, being roughly 2 years younger than Barry Allen.
According to "The Ultimate Guide to Justice League" promotional issue of Entertainment Weekly, at the beginning of Justice League, Cyborg has had his cyborg enhancements for about a year.
Victor currently lives in his father's apartment, which is addressed at 26 Centennial Street, Gotham City, New Jersey.
Victor is left-handed.
Behind the scenes
In an interview, Ray Fisher revealed that Cyborg's main weakness is maintaining his humanity, and not becoming lost to his technology. This was the case of the Cyborg villain known as Grid from the comics and HBO Max's Doom Patrol series.
Ray Fisher only wore a motion capture suit and a modified headlamp for his portrayal of Cyborg, with his body being constructed entirely with CGI.
Cyborg's body was still largely in development during the release of the trailers for  Justice League, being more slim and jagged than the final product shown in the film.

Before Ray Fisher was cast as Cyborg, Michael B. Jordan was in early talks for the role of Cyborg.
Thomas Billings and Michael J. Craven were stunt doubles for Ray Fisher in the role of Cyborg.
Ray Fisher confirmed that every scene featuring Cyborg in Justice League was reshot by Joss Whedon, with the exception of the scene where Victor meets Commissioner Gordon with the rest of the League on a rooftop.
In December 2020, Ray Fisher confirmed that he would no longer play as Cyborg in future films, due to unknown accusations towards Walter Hamada. He also reiterated that Cyborg's planned role in the Flash film was planned to have been significantly more than just a cameo.
Differences in Justice League
All Cyborg's scenes were reshot by Joss Whedon except for joining the League for the first time on the GCPD rooftop.
Cyborg's backstory was signficantly rewritten. Cyborg mentions that the cybernetic reconstruction of his body happened sometime during or after "the night Superman died" which blatantly contradicts the events of Batman v Superman.
