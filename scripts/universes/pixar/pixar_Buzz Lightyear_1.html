Buzz Lightyear is the deuteragonist of the Disney•Pixar Toy Story franchise. He is a spaceman action figure originally belonging to Andy Davis. Buzz was created during a time where astronauts were especially popular amongst children. His arrival in the original Toy Story created conflict with Andy's favorite toy Sheriff Woody, though this rivalry would eventually blossom into a lifelong friendship.

Background
Buzz is a toy from a sci-fi franchise of the same name. In his fictional backstory, Buzz is a universal space ranger from the Intergalactic Alliance and the captain of the Alliance's team. Buzz is trained in several forms of martial arts and is a highly skilled warrior in hand to hand combat. Being in peak physical condition, Buzz makes a perfect space ranger and is an example to many.

Personality
Buzz, like many characters in Toy Story, is a complicated one, who feels genuine emotions such as pride, anger, depression, and sadness, much like a regular human. These are traits that he shares with his best friend, Woody, however, one could say that Buzz is better at keeping his emotions in check than the cowboy. Buzz is known for his bravery and courage with a by the book mindset, believing the way people should live their life by the following rules. Though there are rare moments when he will bend the rules or tell a cover story if needed to when he knows it is the right thing to do. Though possessing great leadership qualities, one of Buzz's biggest character flaws at times is that he can be rather unemotional.

Like Woody, Buzz also goes through an evolution throughout the series. In Toy Story, he was incredibly deluded and actually believed that he himself was the real Buzz Lightyear and not a toy modeled off from the character. Because of this, Buzz believed he could do everything that a real space ranger was able to do such as fly and that his "laser" was a deadly weapon when it was actually just a light bulb. Since seeing the truth of his delusion, Buzz has shown a degree of embarrassment it. In Toy Story 2, while being attacked by another Buzz Lightyear action figure who also thought he was real, Buzz remarked in a self-conscious and annoyed tone: "tell me I wasn't this deluded."

Buzz can come off as being charismatic and charming, most of Andy's toys completely adored him just after he was unwrapped. Even, Andy, whose favorite toy was Sheriff Woody and was completely obsessed with cowboys since kindergarten, went head over heels for Buzz who instantly became his other favorite toy. Buzz also possessed something of a vengeful side, such as attacking Woody when he tried to "terminate" him which was justified by saying "revenge is not something we enforce on my planet. But we're not on my planet, are we?" He is a little bit irrational at times such as attempting to save another toy from being blown up by the neighborhood juvenile delinquent Sid, despite not realizing that he would be destroyed as well but it also shows that he is quite brave as he was willing to rescue a defenseless person even if the odds were stacked against him.

However, his personality changed completely, especially after discovering the truth about himself. At first, he went into a state of manic depression, thinking that he himself was nothing more than "a stupid, plain, insignificant toy", and also developed a bit of a suicidal side. Such moments were when Sid's "cannibal" toys were amassing around him he didn't even look fazed by this. Even when being strapped to an explosive rocket, he didn't seem to remotely care that he might die as he was that depressed. But after being given a motivational speech by a captive Woody, he begins to understand his role as a toy; to bring happiness and joy to their owner. After this, Buzz learns a lot more about honor, friendship, bravery, and selflessness. He is usually seen without his helmet as of Toy Story 2 because he knows he's not a real space ranger and toys do not need space helmets.

By Toy Story 2, Buzz has completely accepted himself as a toy. Woody is one of his closest friends and understands him better than anyone other than the latter's girlfriend, Bo Peep.

Buzz is also slightly clueless to human cultures, such as the case while he was trying to calm Woody down about cowboy camp and accidentally pronounces s'mores as "schmoes," which is corrected by the latter. This was also shown during the first one while looking at Sid, he mistook his pet dog Scud for him.

Buzz notoriously has a massive crush on Jessie. While Buzz is normally awkward around her in Play mode whilst in Demo mode, he refers to her as a temptress and immune to her "bewitching good looks", but when turned to Spanish mode he becomes passionate, confident, and romantic, openly expressing his love for the cowgirl with romantic poetry and admiration. He showed something of a jealous and showy side when Woody returned and Jessie was only happy to see him alive, Buzz replied "el vaquero/the cowboy" in a jealous tone. While trying to escape Sunnyside instead of helping Woody up, he athletically opens a hatch by himself as a means of impressing his crush. After the events of Toy Story 3, the two have seemingly started a legitimate relationship.

Physical appearance
Buzz Lightyear is a brawny electronic spaceman action figure. He has fair skin, blue eyes, an outline of a swirl on his chin (which gives Buzz a cleft chin), a purple head cap and collar, a clear plastic space helmet with purple buttons on both sides that open or close it. His green torso consists of a light blue sticker that has the words "SPACE RANGER" and the Star Command symbol, purple straps connected to it, three oval talk buttons - one blue, one green, and one red, a yellow nametag that says "LIGHTYEAR" above a red button that pops out purple plastic glider wings with red and white candy cane lining on the top of each, and green ends with red and green flashing lights. On his back, he has a white jetpack with a purple valve and green triangular accents and two black and yellow stickers - one says, "DANGER", and the other says "JET EXHAUST". His white arms have gray circular elbows and matching spheres on the end of his upper arms with black rings on it. His gloves have purple lines on his knuckles and fingertips and green squares on the back of each. His right arm has a red button on his upper arm with a yellow and black striped sticker that reads "LASER" and a red light on his right wrist. His left arm has a Space Ranger symbol sticker on his upper arm and a communicator sticker in his wrist communicator (the latter of which is later peeled off) and "MADE IN TAIWAN" engraved inside on his lid of the wrist communicator. A black bending with a thin green waist. His white spaceman pants have matching collars at the bottom and gray spheres behind his knees and hold his white shoes with green toe accents, purple soles, and black handwriting reading "ANDY" on his right shoe sole.

Appearances
Toy Story
Buzz in Toy Story.
In the original Toy Story, Buzz is a birthday present to Andy from his mother, Mrs. Davis. As Woody introduces Buzz to Andy's room and the other toys, the cowboy quickly learns that Buzz believes himself to be an actual "space ranger". This doesn't stop Buzz from becoming the most popular toy in the bedroom, as well as with Andy, who ditches his western aesthetics for that of astronauts and space. That, coupled with Buzz's delusions, sparks a bitter rivalry between Buzz and Woody.

One day, as Andy is about to leave for Pizza Planet, Woody tries to hide Buzz to prevent him from going but he instead, accidentally knocks him out the window. As planned, regardless, Woody is taken instead of Buzz, but only because Andy cannot find him. Buzz sneaks into the back of the family's car anyway. During a gas stop, Buzz confronts Woody for his actions, but their bickering results in the two being left behind. They catch a ride to Pizza Planet but are taken by a cruel child named Sid Phillips before they can reunite with Andy. At Sid's house, Buzz spots a commercial on television advertising the Buzz Lightyear action figure which reveals that the action figures are not made for flight, proving Woody's claim that he's only a toy and not a real space ranger. Buzz tries to prove his legitimacy by trying to fly out of the house through the upstairs window, but ends up falling down the stairs and breaking his arm instead. He falls into a state of depression, which inadvertently foils all of Woody's plans to get home.

Eventually, Sid plots to have Buzz blown up with a new firework he ordered. As Buzz accepts his fate, Woody confesses his insecurities, revealing he felt inadequate compared to a toy as amazing as Buzz. This gives Buzz his confidence back (after Woody says that he can't go back home, because Andy and his toys wouldn't love him anymore), but Sid takes him before the two can escape. Woody gathers the rest of Sid's toys to foil their owner's scheme, successfully saving Buzz. The two then try to return to Andy, but he and his family have already packed up and began to move to their new home. Woody and Buzz use the rocket to catch up, which eventually blasts the two into the air. Instead of plummeting to their doom, Buzz uses his wing feature to "fall with style" (gliding) safely into Mrs. Davis's car, reuniting the two with Andy.

Toy Story 2
Buzz in Toy Story 2.
In Toy Story 2, after Woody is stolen by Al McWhiggin, owner of Al's Toy Barn, Buzz plans a rescue mission consisting of himself, Rex, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, and Hamm. At Al's Toy Barn, while separated from the group, Buzz meets another figure of himself. Unfortunately, he believes he is a real space ranger and seals Buzz away in a box to keep him from "going rogue". Buzz manages to escape and follows his friends (and the fake Lightyear) to Al's apartment, where they reunite with Woody, but there is still confusion about who the real Buzz Lightyear is. Buzz proves his legitimacy by removing the helmet of the fake Lightyear's and showing Andy's name on the bottom of his boot. He tries to convince Woody to return home before Al can sell him off to Japan.

Woody, however, reveals that he wants to stay, as he has grown fearful that Andy will abandon him upon growing up. Though Buzz and the others start to head home without Woody, the cowboy has a change of heart. Unfortunately, the bitter Stinky Pete stops this, forcing Woody to stay with him and the rest of Al's Woody's Round Up toy set. Buzz and the other toys follow Al to the airport, where Woody is put into the luggage compartments. They manage to find him and fight off Stinky Pete, saving Woody as well as Bullseye and Jessie, who all return home with the rest of Andy's toys. During the epilogue, Buzz shows signs of affection towards Jessie, which she accepts.

Buzz Lightyear of Star Command
Buzz as he appears in Buzz Lightyear of Star Command.
Buzz Lightyear is the titular protagonist of the Toy Story spinoff, Buzz Lightyear of Star Command and is 2D animated. This show features Buzz's adventures as a space ranger, fighting the Evil Emperor Zurg. He is shown to command a small team, including Mira Nova, a Tangean princess with phasing powers, Booster, a former janitor from the planet Jo-Ad, and XR, a robot created by the Little Green Men.

The series was preceded by a direct-to-video film, Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins, which showed the formation of the team. The film shows that Buzz became isolated after the death of his first partner, Warp Darkmatter. He meets his future teammates while investigating a crime involving missing LGMs.

Toy Story 3
Buzz in Toy Story 3.
In Toy Story 3, Andy has grown up and is preparing to leave for college. Few toys still remain, and all (except Woody) come to agree that the best thing for them to do is donate themselves. Under Buzz's leadership, they are taken to Sunnyside Daycare, home to toys that have been outgrown by their owners. The leader of the daycare, Lotso, promises Andy's toys that they'll live a long and happy life with Sunnyside, solidifying their decision to stay. This angers Woody, who believes they should return home. The other toys reluctantly refuse, and a downhearted Buzz bids Woody farewell.

Later on, after an extremely rough and torturous day of playtime, Buzz sets off to request that he and his friends be moved to a room with older children. He is instead kidnapped by Lotso's gang and turned to "demo mode". In this state, Buzz's memories are blocked, and as a result his space ranger delusions return. He is recruited as one of Lotso's minions and is ordered to imprison his friends for trying to escape the daycare. Buzz is then left in charge to guard them every night, though the toys (under Woody's guidance, who returned to save them) intimate a plan to return Buzz to normal and return to Andy.

Barbie forces Ken to tell her what Lotso did to Buzz and gets the manual from the bookworm. Unfortunately, their tampering only switches Buzz to Spanish mode, making him a romantic and charismatic space ranger with no memories or the ability to speak English. Nevertheless, he is told that Woody and the others are his friends and joins them in escaping Sunnyside. While doing so, he develops romantic feelings for Jessie, though she is more baffled by his Spanish mode than taken. After confronting Lotso and his gang, the toys are accidentally dragged into a garbage truck and hauled to the dump. Along the way, a television falls on Buzz and reverts him back to his normal self.

Inside the garbage factory, Buzz and the others narrowly escape termination and return to Andy's home the next morning. They wash themselves off and place themselves in a box meant for the attic, which Andy had always intended for them to go while he takes Woody to college. Instead, however, they are donated to a little girl named Bonnie, who loves and cares for them just as much as Andy did in the past.

Toy Story Toons
Buzz plays a significant role in Small Fry, where he and Rex are taken with Bonnie to Poultry Palace. There, Buzz is replaced by a Fun Meal Buzz Lightyear, leaving Buzz stranded at the restaurant. Unable to get through the front door, Buzz goes through the vents, only to fall into the basement, where he meets a support group for discarded Fun Meal Toys. Buzz is mistaken for an abandoned Fun Meal Toy is encouraged to join the group. Fortunately, he manages to escape and reunites with his friends before they make their attempt at rescue. Afterward, Buzz takes his diminutive counterpart to the restaurant, where the latter joins the support group with the former as his "sponsor".

Toy Story of Terror!
Buzz is seen on a road trip with Bonnie to her grandmother's house, watching a scary movie with the other toys. When they are forced to stop off at the Sleep Well motel for the night after Woody warns Mr. Potato Head not to wander off because he might get lost, he leaves anyway and disappears and Buzz, Woody, and Jessie go to search for him and eventually come across his arm. A monster (later revealed to be Mr. Jones) is seen snatching up all the toys, and takes the arm, Buzz and Woody, leaving Jessie alone by herself. It is later revealed that Buzz, along with all the other toys, were taken to Ron's office, where he sells the toys on eBay. The toys are all later saved by Jessie when she opens the cabinet, and when they leave to check out, Bonnie and her mother notice the toys in the background and retrieve them. Buzz along with all the other toys continue their road trip.

Toy Story That Time Forgot
Buzz first appears in the special when Bonnie takes some of her toys to Mason's house. He walks around the Battlesaur playsets. Later, when it is revealed that the Battlesaurs are not aware that they're toys, Buzz tries to explain to The Cleric what they are, but he is shrugged off. Later, Buzz along with Woody is seen being thrown into the Battlesaurs arena, where they are forced to fight. When they lose, the Cleric orders them to be destroyed. However, once the Cleric reveals he knows he's a toy, he realizes he can't let them reveal his secret to the other Battlesaurs.

Buzz and Woody are forced to a vent fan, where they would be destroyed by it, but the fan is turned off by Trixie before they can be destroyed. Buzz later returns with Bonnie to her house.

Toy Story 4 
Buzz in Toy Story 4.
Buzz returns in Toy Story 4. In the flashback, he helps Woody and Bo with rescuing RC. Later, he asks Woody how he is and he is chosen as the towns mailman. He also is the first one to be excited about a road trip. He later meets Forky and mentions how he's a handful the next morning. Later he is told by Woody caring for him is harder than he thought. Later he gets told about an inner voice and notices Forky disappear. He goes with Woody and the gang on a road trip with Bonnie, where the group finds a carnival. He then realises that Woody was right and decides to find them. He is strapped to a prize shelf at a carnival game, where he meets Ducky and Bunny. He escapes and Ducky and Bunny immediately capture him. Woody and Bo Peep assign Buzz, Ducky, and Bunny to help them rescue Forky.

At the antique store, Buzz gathers everyone to steal a key and find Woody and Bo Peep, who end up meeting Duke Caboom, who joins them and they run into Gabby Gabby and the Bensons and exit the antique store, but not before noticing bonnies backpack.

Woody begs everyone to get back in the store, but they leave, and Buzz returns to the RV. Inside the RV, Buzz urges Trixie to act as a hidden GPS and Bonnie's dad is creeped out as if the RV was a monster truck.

After arriving at the carnival, Buzz and the gang find Woody, Bo, Ducky, Bunny, and Duke Caboom. Woody is hesitant to return to Bonnie so Buzz tells him to stay with Bo and the rest of her friends. They watch Woody give his sheriff badge to Jessie, and everyone gives Woody a goodbye hug. As the RV is about to leave, Buzz and Woody utter the words "To infinity and beyond" for the last time. As the RV exits the RV park, Rex asks if Woody will be a lost toy and Buzz replies that he will not.

In a mid-credits scene, Buzz asks how first grade was and about present and explain. Soon he encounters Knifey, a toy that Bonnie made in first grade, who Forky falls in love with.

Buzz is common in Disney Parks around the world as a meetable character. He is also featured in many parades.

Previously, if anyone in the park shouted "Andy's coming!", he, along with the other toys like Jessie, Woody, and the others, would fall down. This soon stopped as little children got scared when they fell, and the falling did damage to their outfits.

Buzz is also featured in a series of Tomorrowland attractions, each with a different name depending on what park they are in. In the rides, which all have the same plot, an audio-animatronic Buzz assigns the rider a mission to stop Emperor Zurg, by using a blaster to shoot at various targets.

Trivia
Buzz's fictional home planet is the planet of Morph.
Buzz Lightyear's name was inspired by Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the second person to walk on the Moon after Neil Armstrong.
Buzz Lightyear was mentioned in Justin Bieber's song, "Boyfriend".
It is interesting to note that in every Toy Story film (except for the fourth film) there is one delusional Buzz Lightyear toy who believes he is a real space ranger.
In the first film, it was the current Buzz Lightyear who believed he was a real space ranger until he learned he was actually just a toy just like Woody had said.
In the second film, when the toys went to Al's Toy Barn, Buzz was attacked by another newer Buzz Lightyear after he tried to take newer Buzz's belt, and was placed in a display box while the other delusional Buzz went with the Woody search group after hearing Rex say he found the secret to beating Zurg (in a video game). It should be noted that this is technically the only instance in the film series thus far that Andy's Buzz himself does not become delusional about being a genuine space ranger.
In the third film, Lotso kidnapped Buzz and reset him to Demo mode where he lost his memories and reverted to his delusional Buzz state. When his friends attempted to reset him, they found they couldn't reset him by putting him back to normal mode and instead accidentally reset him to delusional Buzz in Spanish mode. He later regained his memories and his current persona when he was hit by a TV set while saving Jessie.

He later regained his memories and his current persona when he was hit by a TV set while saving Jessie.
Buzz is similar to Bolt from the 2008 film of the same name, as both believed to possess their TV show superpowers' powers, and yet, do not have them. It is not until later that both heroes realize (and admit) that they don't have any powers.
Buzz's name is different in some languages:
In the French dub, he is named Buzz l'Éclair. He is still named Buzz Lightyear in the French-Canadian dub.
In the French dub, he is named Buzz l'Éclair. He is still named Buzz Lightyear in the French-Canadian dub.
The role of Buzz Lightyear was originally offered to Billy Crystal who turned it down, a move he later admitted regretting. Crystal eventually voiced Mike Wazowski, Monsters, Inc. and reprised the role in Monsters University. Also, Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, Jim Carrey, Bruce Willis, Phil Hartman, Dan Aykroyd, Jason Alexander, Matthew Broderick, Kevin Costner, Michael J. Fox, Richard Gere, David Hasselhoff, Michael Keaton, Wayne Knight, Bill Paxton, Dennis Quaid, Kurt Russell, Adam Sandler and John Travolta were also considered for the role.
Buzz quotes Captain James T. Kirk from Star Trek (1966) when he remarks, "There seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere..."
Buzz does a Vulcan salute from the Star Trek series when saying "Farewell" to Woody at the gas station, when leaving Andy's house to embark on his mission to rescue Woody, and when saying "Farewell" to the other Buzz who is playing catch with Emperor Zurg.
Buzz makes a cameo in Finding Nemo as one of the toys in the dentist's waiting room.
The Lightyear tire brand in the Cars franchise is a reference to Buzz Lightyear's name and is also a parody of the Goodyear tire brand.
Buzz appears during the end credits of Cars as a car, arguing with a car version of Woody. He is a Space Rover, and Woody is a station wagon.
All Piston Cup racers' tires in Cars (including Lightning McQueen's) are branded as "Lightyear," both a reference to Buzz Lightyear and a play on the name Goodyear (an actual tire manufacturer).
The original script for Toy Story 3 had Buzz and his entire toy line recalled back to Taiwan (where the Buzz Lightyear toys are made) due to a defect. Apparently, that defect could have explained why Buzz and his toy line believed themselves to be real space rangers. While this plot idea was ultimately scrapped, the final script did still include an explanation as to why the entire toyline had at the very least initial delusional beliefs to being the real Buzz Lightyear (as apparently they are pre-set to Demo Mode when first made).
In only the North American release of Toy Story 2, Buzz gives out his speech with the US flag in the backdrop and the US national anthem, the "Star-Spangled Banner," playing in the background, similar to the way General Patton did in the film Patton (1970).
The colors on Buzz are the favorites of John Lasseter (lime green) and his wife, Nancy (purple).
Buzz's facial features are loosely based on John Lasseter himself.
Buzz was based on the G.I. Joe toys from the 1960s. However, he more closely resembles the classic Hasbro toy Rom the Space Knight. Like Buzz, Rom is a Space Ranger in a suit of powered armor who fights a race of hostile alien beings with a special laser.
In an episode of House of Mouse, Donald Duck dresses up like Buzz.
Buzz, along with Woody, were at one point planned to appear as new summons in Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, but this idea was scrapped.
Buzz was nominated for AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains. One of three animated heroes appears on the list, along with Belle and Peter Pan. Unfortunately, none of them made the list.
Buzz is 11.43 inches tall, and his helmet adds 0.37 inches.
The quality of Buzz's voice box deteriorated within the ten years between Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3, and is now on par with Woody's sound quality (ironic since Woody is from the 1950s).
Despite coming to terms with his identity as a toy, Buzz is apparently perplexed by the existence of his voice box. In Toy Story 4, after misinterpreting Woody's words, Buzz comes to believe his voice box is, in fact, his conscience, or "inner voice", and begins to listen to its recordings for advice when faced with conflict. It could be possible after being rebooted after the events of the third film and Hawaiian Vacation, Buzz has forgotten certain things such as that.

Buzz has labels on his rear end. In Toy Story, he had a label that said "Disney," which was shown when he attempted to fly out of the window at Sid's house, and in Toy Story 3, he had a Disney/Pixar label that was shown just before he was picked up by a child at Sunnyside. The latter reappears in Kingdom Hearts III.
The characters that Buzz and Zurg are based on from whatever they're from in the Toy Story universe, are spoofs of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. They parody one of the last scenes in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, where Zurg claims he's Buzz's father just like Vader did to Luke, as the Zurg and Utility Belt Buzz in Toy Story 2 think they're the real versions of themselves and fight in a parody of the Luke/Vader fight in Star Wars.
When Toy Story was being made, Buzz wasn't going to be in the main plot. Tinny was going to be in his place. But John Lasseter decided a tin toy wouldn't be a good toy for a boy, so Tinny was scrapped and Lasseter decided to put in a military/space character that a boy would want so badly. When names came around, the original two were Lunar Larry and Tempis from Morph.
Stinky Pete said that space rangers sold more than the 1950's cowboys, which makes it so Buzz's predecessors have been around since the early or late 1960s.
Based on him still functioning after being hit by both water from a water hose in Toy Story 3 and a tidal wave of water when the bathroom door burst out in "Partysaurus Rex", Buzz Lightyear is likely waterproof.
Due to advances in graphical technology by the time of Toy Story 4's production, Buzz's body is shown to be covered in minuscule scratches and dents in the present day, likely the result of many years of being played with in addition to frequent adventures. The "LIGHTYEAR" name tag on his chest, revealed to be a sticker, has also begun to peel off.
Buzz tends to mispronounce words. For example, he mispronounces the word "S'mores" as "Schmoes", and mispronounces Hawaii as "Hay-way-I". Woody corrects him both times.
Buzz is also shown to have weak leadership, making actions without giving orders whatsoever, hence the reason why Woody let Jessie lead his gang.
Despite his strength and size, Buzz can be easily be picked up by Rex, Jessie, and Bo throughout the series.
In Toy Story 3, Buzz's batteries on his back are branded with "Buy n Large", a company appears in WALL-E.
In The Shaggy Dog as Dave Douglas (played by Tim Allen) is racing to the court in his dog form, he dives off a bridge and yells out Buzz's catchphrase "To infinity and beyond!". Flik also says it in A Bug's Life outtakes as he grabs a piece of dandelion, he apologized soon afterward saying that he couldn't resist.
The line was parodied in the Buzz Lightyear of Star Command episode Lost in Time as "To infinity and even further". As well as in the episode Mira's Wedding as "To infinity and jolly well past that".
In The Santa Clause 2 as Scott Calvin is fighting Toy Santa (both of whom are played by Tim Allen), Toy Santa tells Scott "You are one sad strange little man."
In the Cars credits the line (as well as Toy Story) was parodied when the Buzz car called the Woody car "You are one sad strange little wagon."

He is referenced in the Runaways episode "Last Rites" when Karolina refers to her flying as "falling with style".
In the first film, Buzz freezes when he is around Andy and Sid, despite believing he is real and not a toy, which many fans have found confusing,
Despite peeling off his wrist communicator sticker in the first movie and it being permanently absent from his wrist when seen in later movies, real-life Buzz Lightyear toys with an openable communicator (even those specifically based on Andy's Buzz) still include the sticker on his wrist.
