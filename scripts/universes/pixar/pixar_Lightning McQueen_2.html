Lightning in Cars 3: Driven ton Win.
Lightning McQueen appears in Cars 3: Driven to Win. In the story, he uses a simulator at the studio filming Chick Hicks' talk show to do a race with Cruz, Smokey and Doc. When Chick begins to talk to the camera about Lightning's career, the latter reminds him and Natalie Certain about how racing is something to experience, only to find out, after Chick has Storm speak, that the studio has been recording everything, and is challenged by Storm to another race on the studio's simulator.

Lightning is one of the playable characters available from the start of the game, in his second Rust-eze paint job from Cars 3. He is also playable in his "Fabulous Lightning McQueen" paint job, that is unlocked with an update patch of the game released on various dates depending on when the film was released in the player's country.

Cars: Lightning League

LEGO The Incredibles

Lightning McQueen appears as an unlockable character in the LEGO The Incredibles video game, being unlocked by a Pixar Family Build in Waterfront when the player completes all of the story missions in the game. McQueen can be used to compete in races, fight enemies, use jumps and ramps, and bounce on trampolines, but he cannot pull levers, grab onto ladders or ledges, compete in races that require flying characters, perform special attacks, pick up items left by robbers, build bricks, double-jump, jump onto bombs, turn handles, nor survive when in contact with the ocean. However, he does have the special ability of using his headlights in really dark areas that only characters with the power of light can access. He can also drive fast just like the other fast characters. Unlike other vehicles in the game, McQueen steers in a similar manner to humans.

His appearance is based after the Cars 3 Lego set 10730 Lightning McQueen Speed Launcher.



Disney Parks

Lightning appears in Cars Land at Disney's California Adventure, as a "drive-around" character, and regularly stops outside the Cozy Cone Motel's office. He originally appeared in his World Grand Prix paint job from Cars 2, but was changed to his Cars 3 design in 2017. In addition, Lightning would also "talk" to the guests and interact with them every few moments.

An audio-animatronic version of Lightning appears in the ride Radiator Springs Racers, first with Sally Carrera as they greet the riders while heading into either Luigi's or Ramone's, and again at the end of the ride with Mater. He appears in his original Rust-eze paint job.

In Lightning McQueen's Racing Academy at Disney's Hollywood Studios, Lightning appears in animatronic form to offer guests advice on how to become a racer and employs the use of the driving simulators from Cars 3. When Chick Hicks hacks into the simulator, McQueen challenges him to a virtual race to settle their unfinished business.

He is seen in the Paint the Night Parade and Hong Kong Disneyland, and Disney California Adventure with Mack and DJ, and was seen with Mater in the Pixar Play Parade before it moved to Disneyland in 2018 for Pixar Fest. It is unknown whether or not he’ll return to the parade in the future.

Trivia
His racing number was going to be 57 at first, as a reference to John Lasseter's birth in 1957, but the filmmakers later changed it to "95", referencing Toy Story's release in 1995.
Lightning is named after deceased Pixar supervising animator Glenn McQueen.
For some reason, Lightning is in his original Rust-eze paint job in the second film's teaser trailer, even though it never appeared in the film. However, it could be that the filmmakers did not have his new customization completed at the time.
One of the children in Toy Story 3 who plays in Sunnyside's Caterpillar Room wears a T-shirt that includes Lightning's bolt and racing number in the same style.
A toy that looks similar to Lightning can be seen in the Butterfly Room in Toy Story 3.
In the first film, Lightning noted the reason why he did not have any actual headlights was because he thought racers do not need them on a racetrack that is always lit with lights. However, in the second film, when he was being upgraded for the World Grand Prix, he decided to replace his headlight stickers with actual headlights, though Sally still calls him "Stickers".


When Lightning and Mater arrive in Tokyo in Cars 2, they notice an advertisement that shows a vacuum cleaner called "Lightning McClean" and have a good laugh over it.
Despite his dislike of Rust-eze in the first film, he does have his own commercial where he tells the viewer about the purpose of the ointment.
In spite of turning down Tex's offer to take on the Dinoco sponsor, "Dinoco McQueen" has appeared in several forms of merchandising and is even an alternate skin in Cars: The Video Game; those who play the full game with said skin creates the impression of the game taking place in a slightly alternate reality in which Lightning accepted Tex's offer.
Lightning McQueen is unique among the Pixar protagonists, as he does technically both lose and win. He gave up his Piston Cup title to Chick Hicks so he can help The King finish his last race, but it was meant as a lesson for him as he learned that helping others is more important than winning races and that his heroic actions made him earn applause from the crowd. Therefore, despite losing, McQueen is still considered the true winner of the eyes of his fans and his new friends from Radiator Springs, due to the actions of Chick Hicks.
With seven Piston Cups won by the time of Cars 3, Lightning has reached the same number of championships won by the King himself before his retirement.
In Cars 3, it was mentioned that McQueen got his first win in Glen Allen Speedway during his rookie years prior to the events of the first film.
When McQueen thinks of wanting the Dinoco sponsorship, his succeses are that he would be taken for a photoshoot with his trophy, being on different media magazines, going to the Chinese Theater in Hollywood with Mia and Tia as their new celebrity, starring in a fictionalized car-ified movie as "Lightning Storm" in which he is a racecar and a superhero with fighter jet characteristics who has to stop alien tripod spark plugs from invading Earth, and living in his own penthouse in Hollywood with modified magwheels and with Mia and Tia being colored gold.
Lightning's first name is different in several languages:
In the Spanish and Latin Spanish versions, he is called Rayo McQueen, which "rayo" is the Spanish meaning of the words "lightning", "beam", and "ray."
In the French and French-Canadian versions, he is named Flash McQueen.
In the Polish version, his first name is Zygzak (z-ih-g-z-ah-k). This means "zigzag" in Polish.

In the European Portuguese version, his first name is changed to Faísca, which means "spark".

As a result of Lightning's first name being translated in several languages, most appearances of the name "Lightning McQueen" in text, across the entire Cars trilogy, get simply shorten down to simply "McQueen" in international cuts of the movies.
The same scream that McQueen was on the simulator in Cars 3 was the same scream that Mater was deploying parachute while travelling to Buckingham Palace in Cars 2.
Throughout the first film, Lightning had fourteen different appearances, counting the different amount of dirt and dust he received in several scenes.
His catchphrase, "Ka-chow!", is said briefly by Mayday in Planes: Fire & Rescue, when he is showing some Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment on his bumper. The Home video subtitles reveal he's sneezing.
A life-size Lightning McQueen is preserved at the Petersen Automotive Museum.
A 1:55 scale die-cast of Lightning McQueen, with Chick Hicks and Brush Curber, appears in one of the exhibit elements at The Science Behind Pixar.
In the book, Cars Origins: Struck by Lightning, Lightning reveals that his original name was "Monty", short from ''Montgomery'', and that "Lightning" is a nickname he acquired.
