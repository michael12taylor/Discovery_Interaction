Background
When Violet is first introduced, she is depicted as a gloomy, uncertain, overwhelmed, shy, and socially withdrawn girl who has a few self-esteem issues - preferring to hide behind her long straight bluish-black hair, which seems to be reflected in her powers. She has a crush on one of her schoolmates named Tony Rydinger, but she is too shy to approach him and becomes invisible whenever he looks her way to avoid attention.

Violet's family life is also tense, especially between her and Dash. Because of Bob's difficulty concealing his powers in public, the family has been forced to move several times over the past few years. Also, Helen has told both kids never to do the same (unless they are in danger) because they are required by law to blend in with the rest of the world. Because of these factors (along with Violet being at puberty age), she has become rather shy and has few friends. And with Dash dealing with the family issues by constantly teasing her, Violet also has somewhat of a temper.

Physical appearance
Violet is a teenager with a slender build, a circular head, a small waistline, long legs, fair skin, long straight bluish-black hair (which usually covers half her face on the left side and the right side in The Incredibles), bluish-purple eyes, rosy cheeks, and pink lips. She is 160 cm (5'3") tall and she weighs 41 kg (90 lbs). In both films, she is 14-years-old. In the first film, she wears a moderate blue buttoned sweater, a pair of jeans, and black-and-white sneakers. Her super-suit consists of a red unitard, along with an orange belt and black gloves, thigh-high boots, and a black eye mask. She also wears an orange headband with her super-suit. Near the end of the movie and starting with the sequel, she wears a pink headband, pink shirt, khakis and blue shoes.

Personality
At first, Violet's personality is literally that of a "shrinking violet" where she is a generally shy and withdrawn girl, down to her understated taste in clothing and shadowy hairstyle. Throughout the first half of The Incredibles, Violet is symbolically hiding behind her hair, as a way to hide from the world. She also uses her invisibility as another way to hide from her peers. As the first film's events continue to push her past her comfort zone, she quickly begins to embrace her powers and gain more confidence in who she is.

Violet is shown to possess a curious and experimental nature, willing to explore her abilities and her world once she is freed from the family prohibitions about using her superpowers. She also has a sharp and observational sense of humor and is very kind and caring, and despite a strong sibling rivalry, she is strongly protective of her little brother Dash. She also cares for Jack-Jack, constantly holding him and being amazed by his powers.

In Incredibles 2, Violet has embraced her powers and displays a broader range of emotions that is typical of a girl her age: losing her temper, acting awkward and at times being depressed. However, she ultimately develops a sense of maturity and begins to appreciate the sacrifices her parents make for her and her brothers. This is best seen when she was touched by Bob's apology and his desire to be a good father after he made a mistake.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Invisibility: Violet has the ability to turn herself invisible. The exact nature of this power is not explained, nor are its limits (such as if it extends beyond the visible light spectrum). Violet's ability is limited in scope, however, and extends only to her own body. Anything she is carrying or wearing does not also become invisible, with the exception of her Incredibles uniform created by designer Edna Mode to coordinate with her powers.
Force-Field Generation: Violet can generate a near-indestructible, purple-tinged force field around herself or other targets, which she has used defensively or, with the right help, offensively. The field does seem to deflect things like bullets, this is proven when the family battles against Syndrome's soldiers. In the sequel, Violet has learned how to use her force-fields for offensive attacks and not just in self-defense.
Levitation: If Violet is not touching the ground when she creates a full force bubble, she will levitate within it, possibly due to the Earth's gravity becoming diminished within that confined domain. Whilst levitating, she automatically moves with her force field bubbles. She can reorient her position within it, or even use her own body to propel it forward. This is what gives the force bubble its primary offensive ability, especially when it's combined with Dash's superhuman speed to create the IncrediBall.
IncrediBall Generation: Created with the aid of Dash to mow down their foes and destroy everything, including enemies tanks. This was shown in the first movie.

IncrediBall Generation: Created with the aid of Dash to mow down their foes and destroy everything, including enemies tanks. This was shown in the first movie.
Abilities
Intellect: While not a superhuman trait, Violet's intellect is certainly the highest of her family, showing a curious and adaptable nature about herself, her powers, and the world around her. One notable example of this is when her family, trapped by Syndrome, was seemingly helpless against his electrical gauntlets, but Violet was able to determine how to use her force fields to bypass the electrical fields and escape with relative ease.
Athleticism: Although it was not exactly seen in the movie, in Disney Infinity, Violet was seen to be very acrobatic and maneuverable, despite her skinny frame. This was shown in the film's sequel during a brawl with a mind-controlled Voyd, in which Violet was able to keep away from Voyd's portals despite being in close-range. Violet also displayed enough strength to overpower Voyd when grabbed by the arms. She is also a very agile runner, able to effortlessly catch up to the Underminer's drill as it rampaged through the city.
Weakness
Blunt Force: While exceedingly sturdy, if very heavy blunt force is applied to Violet's force field, it can be crushed and she can be hurt badly. The bubble can, to an extent, be moved around her, as shown in the film when the Omnidroid drops down on her shield, causing it to drop around her and crack her on the head, rendering her unconscious. This is demonstrated again in the sequel, in the scene where the hypnotized Supers attack her and her brothers, Krushauer is shown shrinking her force field before the Incredibile hits him.
Energy Draining: Both her powers can also sap her physical energy if she tries to maintain them under sustained heavy assault (as seen in A Magic Kingdom Adventure).
Corrosive substances: Liquids such as Reflux's molten acid can corrode the force field.
Clothes: Violet cannot turn her clothes invisible like herself, so she is forced to wear a super-suit that will turn invisible when she does. This limits the usefulness of her invisibility to a great extent unless she wants to run in her suit all the time.
Appearances
The Incredibles
Violet expresses her wish to be normal.
When she is first introduced, Violet is depicted as gloomy, uncertain, shy, socially withdrawn, and has a few self-esteem issues - preferring to hide behind her long hair, which it seemed to be reflected in her superpowers; she is able to turn invisible at will and can generate a spherical force field around herself and others. She has a crush on one of her classmates, Tony Rydinger, but she is too shy to approach him and turns herself invisible whenever he looks her way so as to avoid attention. At home, things are tense, especially between her and her younger brother Dash. Because of Bob being in his "not-allowed-to-Super" rut for the past few years, the family has moved around quite a few times. Also, Violet's mother Helen has told the kids to never use their powers (unless they are in danger) because the world is not ready to accept them yet. Because of these factors (along with Violet being at puberty age), she has become rather shy and has few friends. And with Dash dealing with the family issues by constantly teasing her, Violet also has somewhat of a temper on her.

When Bob goes away on a "business trip", things start to greatly improve at the Parr household, with Bob being a better father to his kids (shown by hanging out with Dash, taking care of Jack-Jack, and kissing Violet on the nose). After two months of the new Bob, Violet and Dash discover Helen getting ready to go out for the night while packing what appear to be Super suits. After the two of them discover the extraordinary properties of the super-suits designed for them by Edna Mode (in Violet's case, her suit can turn invisible along with her, rendering her totally unseen, without disrupting her force fields; the force field part is discussed in A Magic Kingdom Adventure), they stow away on their mother's jet (after calling on her friend Kari McKeen to watch Jack-Jack for the night) when she leaves to find their father, who has been doing secret hero work behind his family's back. Shortly after they are discovered by Helen, the plane is attacked by Syndrome's missiles, and Helen orders Violet to put a force field around them for protection. However, Violet is not sure she can even generate such a large force field; the stress of the situation and her low confidence prevents her from successfully carrying out the order.

Violet practicing her powers on the campfire.
Helen is forced to use her powers to turn herself into a ball around her children, shielding them just as the missiles destroy the plane. When Violet later apologizes to her mother for failing to live up to expectations, Helen apologizes for putting her under such pressure and reassures her by saying that she has more power than she herself realizes, but also explains that in their situation, doubt is a luxury they can no longer afford. Her confidence bolstered, Violet practices her power on the fire in the camp, but she and Dash are nearly burnt to a crisp when Syndrome launches a rocket carrying a highly capable battle robot, the Omnidroid v.10, to the City of Metroville; the cave that the two were in is also the exhaust tube for the rocket.

After some time, Syndrome's henchmen discover the children after their curiosity triggers an alarm—subsequently pursuing them across his island base. She attacks one of the men with a large stick, while invisible. Displaying a high level of ingenuity, the aforementioned grunt uses dirt to find Violet once she has submerged herself in a shallow pond. He aims the gun at her, preparing to shoot her, but Dash stops the soldier from killing Violet, who in return saves him from yet another henchman. After dispatching security, she and Dash combine their powers to create the IncrediBall (named in the video game): Violet generates a force-field, and Dash runs along its inner surface, propelling the sphere at considerable speeds and mowing down everything in their path.

Violet battles beside her family.
After Violet and Dash are reunited with their parents, both of whom are briefly flattened by the IncrediBall, another wave of henchmen find and attack them. Violet once again displays her increasing confidence, raising a large shield that protects her family from a hail of automatic weapons fire. Though the guards are quickly overpowered, Syndrome captures the entire family. Once imprisoned, Violet manages to free everyone by creating a force field that severs her magnetic bonds. She manages to roll towards a nearby computer terminal, where she easily deactivates everyone's restraints.

The family races to the hanger, hoping to find an aircraft fly back to the mainland. Dash suggested they use a nearby rocket. When Helen stated she couldn't fly a rocket, Violet said they merely required the coordinates from the last launch to use it. They were assisted by Mirage, who turned against Syndrome. When her parents sharing some moments together, Violet realizes that the Omnidroid's claw is pointing at their van and crushes it, but Violet and Dash managed to run at the time. When they're running, the robot's claw nearly hits them, separating Violet and Dash from their parents. The Omnidroid attacks again, but this time Violet defends herself and Dash with her shield. The Omnidroid goes mad and punches Violet's shield several times until it drops its body entirely to Violet's shield, crushing it and hits her straight on her head, knocking her unconscious. She managed to recuperate very quickly, although she has been hit by the thing's gigantic metallic body. After Helen trip-wires the robot, Violet acquires the remote used by Syndrome to control it. After playing a game of keep-away with the Omnidroid, she and Dash childishly fight over the remote until Elastigirl takes it. After a drawn-out fight, the family waits as the Omnidroid approaches. Violet refuses Helen's order to hide and remains by her side when Bob finally pierces the Omnidroid's shell.

Finally, after stopping Syndrome from abducting Jack-Jack (where Violet also saves her family by creating a force field to deflect the falling plane wreckage), the evildoer is apparently dispatched by his own cape caught in a turbine jet engine.

Tony invites Violet to the movies.
Three months later, Violet is seen wearing a pink shirt and khaki pants, along with a pink headband to keep her hair out of her face, displaying her attractiveness. With her recent personality change, Violet has made more friends and is courageous enough to talk to Tony (he approaches her and attempts to ask her out, but HE is now the shy one rather than Violet), and they plan to go to the movies on Friday; Violet tells Tony that she will buy the popcorn if he buys the tickets.

Violet is then shown to be ready to battle a new villain, the Underminer when he arrives to threaten the town, thereby setting up the story of the sequel.

Incredibles 2
Violet accidentally exposes her identity.
At the start of the film, Violet wants to help her parents battle the Underminer, but Helen and Bob insist she, Dash, and Jack-Jack stay behind and remain safe. When Dash runs off to help, Violet tries to stop him with her force fields to no avail. Frustrated at being left to care for Jack-Jack on her own, Violet throws her mask on the ground, inadvertently revealing her identity to Tony, who runs off in disbelief. Violet eventually catches up with Dash and sees the Underminer's giant drill rampaging through the city. She uses force field projectiles to save citizens from falling rubble. With her father's help, Violet enters the drill and protects her family from an explosion caused by Bob and Helen blowing out the engine. Despite their heroic acts, she and her family are arrested by the police and eventually released by NSA agent Rick Dicker.

After Helen receives a job from Winston Deavor at Devtech to campaign the return of Supers, the Parrs are given a new, extravagant home owned by Deavor away from a motel they have stayed at since their previous home's destruction. Violet eagerly waits to attend her date with Tony at the movies, but the latter doesn't show up, causing her to run to her room and rebuff Bob's attempts to console her. She then spends the night crying and eating ice cream. At school, Violet confronts Tony for neglecting their date, but the latter is confused and asks if he knows her. Shocked and abashed, Violet runs away. Back home, she becomes a saddened and agitated wreck. She eventually finds out that Bob had contacted Dicker to find Tony and wipe his memory of Violet's identity as a Super, incidentally wiping the date he had planned with Violet. Furious, Violet openly denounces her life as a Super and attempts to destroy her suit in the kitchen sink's garbage disposal, which proves futile.

Bob brings Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack to a restaurant called The Happy Platter, where Tony works part-time at. Violet is unaware of this fact and is astonished that Tony is serving them, spraying the water she was drinking out of her nose and embarrassing herself.

The next day, Violet discovers that her baby brother Jack-Jack has powers and that her father knew all along but hid this from her and Dash. When she confronts him, she is shocked into silence when Bob rants at her about how overwhelmed he is. Finally realizing how much her father had been doing and how tired he is. Violet calls Lucius for help when Bob is unable to tame Jack-Jack.

During Lucius' visit, she is amazed to discover Jack-Jack's powers as Dash is. Later, an exhausted Bob confesses to Violet that he sent the baby to Edna and admits that he was trying to be a good dad by fixing her problem with Tony and do good for her and her brothers. A sympathetic and touched Violet hugs him, saying he is not "good" but "super". Bob then falls asleep for seventeen hours. Violet left him a blanket and is pleased he is back to himself.

Later on, she and her brother join Bob in testing Jack-Jack's new powers. After overhearing Bob's call of their mother, Violet renounces her previous renunciation of heroes to save her parents.

The following night, they are attacked by Evelyn Deaver's mind-controlled Supers. With help from Frozone, Violet and her brothers are able to escape when Dash enables the Incredimobile, to pick them up. Dash, Violet, and Jack-Jack sneak on board the DevTech's ship to rescue their parents.

Violet shields off He-Lectrix's attacks.
After Helen and Bob are captured by Evelyn Deavor (who plans to undermine Winston's campaign due to her secret hatred for Supers), Evelyn hypnotizes Voyd, Screech, Reflux, Krushauer, He-Lectrix, and Brick and sends them to capture Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack at their home. Lucius intervenes but is captured and hypnotized by Evelyn's goggles as well. The kids escape using their father's vehicle, the Incredimobile, which they also use to board the Deavor's ship to rescue their parents.

As they search for Helen and Bob, Violet faces off with a hypnotized Voyd. Despite a struggle with Voyd almost putting a pair of Evelyn's goggles on her, Violet manages to overpower her foe by kicking her away with her boots and blasting her over the railing with a force field, knocking Voyd unconscious. Once they've managed to find their parents and Lucius in the ship's cockpit, Jack-Jack is able to free Helen from Evelyn's goggles, and Violet is briefly reunited with her mother, who admits that she is proud of her heroism rather than acting concerned. After the goggles are removed from the other hypnotized Supers, Violet works with Dash, Bob, and Lucius to prevent the rampaging ship from crashing into the city while Helen thwarts Evelyn's escape. On the mainland, the Supers are celebrated as heroes, and Evelyn is arrested. Violet's heroism is individually praised by Winston, and Violet strikes an applauding conversation with Voyd, who apologizes for attacking her on the ship. Shortly after, Supers are made legal again.

Violet reintroduces herself to Tony.
At the end of the film, Violet confidently approaches Tony at school, and they plan another date. Much to Violet's discontent, the couple is driven to the movie theater by the Parrs. They soon witness two speeding cars engaged in a shoot-out. Tony hurriedly exits the car as Violet promises to be back at the theater in time for the movie before the family takes off to stop the threat.

Printed media
Boom! Studios's The Incredibles comics
In the comic series (non-canon), Violet has reverted back to her shy nature, as she is seen wearing dark clothes and having her hair in her face.

When new neighbors move in at the start of the first book, Violet meets and becomes close with the older child of the family, a boy named Xander (Tony, her crush from the movie, is not mentioned in the comic series). Dash and Xander's brother Bart later watch the two of them kiss through binoculars. However, when his mother is revealed to have been one of Helen's old rogues, a chemist named Organa, a great battle ensues in the Parr home that is resolved when Dash uses a De-Evolution bomb of the supervillain Futur10n and turns Organa into a monkey. Unable to let his wife go to jail, Jim Carson agrees to move his family to the outskirts of town (in the mountains), and Violet and Xander have to keep in touch through online communication.

Violet becomes a target of the villain Mezmerella and is used as a hypnotized pawn in her scheme to destroy Metroville with a psychic shockwave. When the plan fails via Dash's actions, the villain pushes Violet off the skyscraper, and Dash is trapped in an illusionary world before eventually escaping to save Violet and defeat Mezmerella.

In a later story, Helen has gone out of town on a secret mission, telling Bob and the kids she will see her parents. Bob decides to use this time to put Dash through some advanced training that they both know Helen would never allow. To keep this thoroughly secret, he has Violet get a small job filing at Doc Sunbright's lab (however, this is revealed to be just busy work to keep her distracted while Bob and Lucius train Dash so that Violet does not tell Helen). However, Violet (believing it to be real) does not want to work and says she has a life she wants to live. Bob (more-than-likely right on the spot) tells her she needs to "prove" that she is responsible, and (unintentionally) acts very cold to her and leaves, leaving Violet depressed (and definitely NOT fixing the already thin-line relationship they already have due to his years of ignoring the family). But Violet gets her revenge by stealing from Doc's lab, taunting Bob about the fact that the thief (her) is right in front of him without him realizing it.

Violet uses one of the devices she stole, a teleporter, to contact Xander again. He swipes his mother's old gear to try and become a tech hero. While out on a patrol/date, the two encounters a revived Tronosaurus Rex, but the two are in over their heads and eventually, Bob and Dash have to defeat the robotic titan, though Bob doesn't see that Xander was involved in the fight, and Dash, after seeing Violet almost cry, agrees to keep his sister's secret.

In the (currently) last story arch, Violet is first seen at the mall with Helen (she was possibly able to convince her mom to let her quit her "job") looking at dresses. Helen, knowing Violet's gloomy, tomboyish nature, knows that she wants the dress because she is crushing on a boy, and she reveals she knows it is Xander (Violet had accidentally doodled Xander's name with some hearts on the back of a page of homework she asked Helen to look over). Helen promises to wait until the time is right to tell Bob and lets Violet buy the dress.

When the Unforgivables ultimate plan finally goes into motion, Violet and Helen are captured by a group of plant vines and taken into the Underminer's giant robot, a modified Omnidroid-based mechanoid designed to look like it belonged to the Incredibles themselves and in conjunction with Mezmerella's hypnotic broadcast, turn Metroville against the Supers. Though the robot is destroyed by the supers, the plan has already worked, and the heroes are forced out of town. However, in the very last panel of the last comic, Xander is seen spying on the Unforgivables, the look on his face hinting at a plan.

Kingdom Keepers
Violet assists the Keepers during the final battle in The Insider, teaming up with Finn constantly as her invisibility powers proved useful for scouting and sneak attacks. She assisted with defeating Ursula and recovering the final piece of Mickey's picture. Also, she translates for Mickey to the Keepers. Until Mickey Mouse does speak in the Return series.

Video games
The Incredibles video game
In the video game based on the film, Violet is only playable in one level, "Violet's Crossing", where she is to sneak pass Syndrome's guards without getting spotted. Her only ability at this level is invisibility, and like Dash, she has the weakest health level compared to Mr. and Mrs. Incredible. In the next level, "Incredi-Ball", she is playable alongside Dash. Like in the film, Violet generates a force-field around both herself and her brother, and Dash moves the force sphere by running along its inside surface, propelling it at considerable speeds and mowing down every enemy in their path. In this gameplay, both Violet and Dash have an equal health level compared to Mr. and Mrs. Incredible.

Disney Infinity
Violet Parr is a playable character in Disney Infinity who can be purchased separately or in a "Girl Power" three-pack (alongside Rapunzel and Vanellope von Schweetz). She can use her invisibility powers and create a shield for protection, she also works well with other characters from The Incredibles and she will increase the Shooter of her family. Violet is a shooter type in the 3DS version. By level 4 you gain a medal for leveling her up to level 4 and by level 10.

Kinect Rush: A Disney/Pixar Adventure
Violet appears in the first level of The Incredibles stages, "Jungle Rumble", where she assists the player in rescuing Mirage from the Omnidroid v.10.

Disney Parks
Incredicoaster
Violet appears with the rest of the family in this Pixar Pier attraction at Disney California Adventure. In the preshow video focused on media coverage of the "new" rollercoaster dedicated to The Incredibles, Violet offers a more cynical perspective on the proceedings by pointing out that the "Incredicoaster" is just their name being applied to an old classic coaster, a nod to the attraction's actual origin as an overlay of California Screamin'. Aboard the attraction itself, Violet appears hanging from the end of one of the scream tubes, using her forcefields to put out fires started by the runaway Jack-Jack and protect the passengers.

Trivia
It is possible that Violet's powers were based on Marvel Comics' Invisible Woman, a member of the Fantastic Four who could create force-fields and turn invisible.
Violet may be named after the term "shrinking violet": a person who does not wish to be noticed. She is very shy, and, even at home, stays in the background and does not speak too much. This would fit both her personality and powers. And interestingly, Shrinking Violet is the name of a DC Comics superheroine whose superpower was to literally shrink.
Violet is a color generated by the mix of red and blue, which are the main colors of her parents' costumes in their glory days.
Violet's hair evolves over the course of the film to match her personality and personal growth; first totally obscuring her face at the beginning to match her retreating nature, and then being held partially back by the hairband of her Incredible suit, and finally being swept back completely by a colorful hairband in the final sequence, revealing her new self to the world.
Violet is, arguably, the most powerful figure in Disney Infinity.
In a deleted scene (the original opening), Violet was to first appear as an infant who had problems with spitting up. It was originally implied that her existence violated the law, as Supers were forbidden to marry each other and have children.
Violet (and possibly her mom Helen) was originally going to appear in the canceled Princess Academy shorts (due to a piece of concept art showing her with other characters), had this not occurred, it would have marked the first time Violet and her mom would have appeared in 2D format (not counting that The Incredibles was originally envisioned as a 2D film).
If one looks closely, they can see that Violet's eyes are a shade of blue that is almost purple.
Violet's eyes can sometimes be seen as purple due to certain lightings and the bluish-purple color of her eyes. Her eye color is a mixture between blue and purple (mainly blue) making them bluish-purple.
