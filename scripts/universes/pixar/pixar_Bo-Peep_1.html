Background
She is inspired by the character of the classic children's nursery rhyme Little Bo-Peep. Bo is sometimes considered to be "Andy's toy" because Andy likes to make her the damsel in distress of his plays. Bo is the romantic interest (later girlfriend) of Woody, providing a calm and loving comfort whenever he is overwhelmed. She is noted for using her shepherdess crook to hook her cowboy and bring him closer in a romantic way. In private, she is a great deal more daring with her words and actions, which Woody seems to be quite fond of. In Toy Story 4, her origins are slightly explained by Woody to Giggle McDimples. She and her sheep were bought along with the lamp not too long after Molly was born, due to the baby being scared of the dark, which "broke every toy's heart", according to Woody. The lamp comforted Molly and she would often have her hand lay on Bo's feet.

Development
Originally, Woody's girlfriend in the first Toy Story was supposed to be a Barbie doll instead of Bo Peep, but Mattel refused to license the character to Disney. However, after the success of Toy Story (and boost in sales for Mr. Potato Head and other featured toys), Mattel gave Disney permission to have Barbie dolls in Toy Story 2, 3, and 4.

In the infamous Black Friday reel, Bo was actually the first to accuse Woody of deliberately throwing Buzz out of the window, and also participates in having Woody being thrown off the bed (and later, thanks to Slinky, out of the window). She might have felt terrible for her actions after they found out that Woody was gone. In addition, she sounded slightly different in this version, sporting a Southern Belle accent provided by Kath Soucie.

Bo Peep's shrinking role in the series after the first film is explained in The Art of Toy Story 3. Bo Peep was among the main cast of the first film as a voice of female reason and was not Andy's toy, but part of a porcelain lamp in Molly's bedroom. When traveling with the main characters, Bo could easily "shatter into a million pieces" whilst doing dangerous stunts. Due to being unable to find a believable spot in the story, Bo Peep only appears at the beginning and end of Toy Story 2. Bo Peep was ultimately written out of Toy Story 3, due to the fact Molly and Andy wouldn't want her anymore, and emblematic of the losses the toys have had over time. She also was written out due to the belief that Andy probably wouldn't have anything to say about her when he gives the other toys to Bonnie at the third film's end.

Personality
Bo Peep is a very romantic and levelheaded toy. She has strong feelings for Woody, which causes her (along with Slinky) to give him the benefit of the doubt when he allegedly murders Buzz Lightyear, whom she clearly considers attractive as well, and consistently whispers to the wall her worries about where Woody could be. Despite this, she still behaves like a free spirit. She only believes what she has witnessed for herself, such as when she looks into Lenny's visor and sees Buzz riding behind Woody aboard RC, while the rest of the toys immediately take her word for it. By the time she is moved to Molly's room, she becomes more of a leader amongst her toys as she is described by Woody to be the most capable of easing Molly's cries at night which often caused great dismay to everyone.

Since she parted ways with Andy, Bo has taken on a different point of view in life. As a lost toy, she never worries about being loved by a child and is open to see the world.

Physical appearance
Bo, along with her sheep, is a porcelain figurine. She has painted blonde hair with three curls on the back, light vinyl skin, and tall. In the original two films, her outfit consisted of a pink bonnet with a white ribbon, a pink dress with a long, poofy, white skirt that featured pink polka dots, a blue jumpsuit under her dress with ruffles at the pant legs, and black Mary Jane shoes.

In the fourth film, she has an updated appearance: Her skin is fairer, and her eyes are wider. In the beginning flashback scene, her dress has the same appearance, but the colors are brighter, and her dress is looser for Bo to move more freely, indicating that the petticoats and hoop skirt that gave it its original appearance were removed. When becoming a lost toy, Bo is faded, and her skin, particularly around her face and arms, has been chipped. Her bonnet was burned from an incident involving a light bulb from her lamp exploding and was discarded, half of her dress is also discarded while the skirt has been created into a two-in-one skirt/cape that while still has the white side with pink polka dots, has purple on the other side with a plastic flower button to keep it in place. Her remaining attire is now her blue jumpsuit with pink ribbon wrapped around it, Mary Jane shoes, white tape on her right bicep, purple tape on her left wrist, and a large, pink bow on her head to replace the bonnet.

Appearances
Toy Story
Bo and Woody after having playtime with Andy.
In Toy Story, Bo Peep is introduced as Woody's love interest. Andy has set up a stage and is portraying Bo Peep as a distressed shepherdess who is despaired when Mr. Potato Head, (One-Eyed Bart) "robs" the bank. While holding her at "gunpoint", he tells her to be quiet or her sheep (who are put on Andy's race track) will get run over which horrifies her. Bo then calls for help and Woody soon arrives to save the day yet again. Later, as Andy and Molly leave their bedroom, Woody tells everyone the coast is clear, causing every toy to spring to life. As Woody prepares an unplanned staff meeting, he is pulled away by Bo's crook. She kindly thanks him for saving her flock, and offers to get someone to watch her sheep, with the intention of spending time alone with Woody. The cowboy nervously giggles in response, but Bo then reminds him that she's "only a couple of blocks away" as she walks back to her lamp.

Bo impressed with Andy's new toy, Buzz Lightyear.
After Buzz Lightyear arrives in Andy's room, Bo is impressed by the space ranger like the other toys. Woody murmurs in jealousy to Bo how the other toys act as they've never seen a new toy before, but she defends them by saying that Buzz has more gadgets on him than a "Swiss army knife." After showing off his wings, Buzz takes on Woody's challenge that he can fly with his eyes closed. The action figure stands on the top of Andy's headboard and leaps off, landing on a ball, bouncing off of it to land on the racetrack, goes through the loop and gets caught on the model plane hanging on the ceiling, spins in circles, and lands back where he was, all with his eyes closed. Much to Woody's shock, the toys cheer in excitement, with Bo saying how "she just found her moving buddy".

Even after Woody is shoved to the side by Andy, who soon decorates his room with Buzz Lightyear paraphernalia and eventually writes his name on Buzz's boot, Bo still remains faithful to Woody and tells him she knows Andy is excited about Buzz but reminds him that he will always have a special place for the cowboy. But Mr. Potato Head overhears this and jokes to them about how the only special place for Woody is in the attic, causing Woody to angrily storm over and confront Buzz. Soon, however, they hear a kid laughing maniacally outside. The gang looks out the window to find Sid Phillips, Andy's neighbor, abusively playing with a Combat Carl toy in his backyard. After being informed by Rex that Sid tortures toys for his own pleasure, Buzz believes he should teach him a lesson. He is about to jump down from the window, but Bo restrains him with her crook, telling him to get down. After watching Sid blow up the toy, Bo says that the sooner the Davis' move out, the better.

That evening, after Buzz is accidentally knocked out the window, Bo Peep is horrified when Mr. Potato Head blames Woody for the accident, and she tries to stop the toys from ambushing him, but they are forced to retreat when they hear Andy coming back to the room. As the Davis family leaves for the evening, the toys try and use the Barrel of Monkeys as a chain to grab Buzz (not realizing Buzz grabbed onto the bumper of the family car as it drove off) out the window with Bo's crook, but it's too short, and they've used the whole barrel.

That night, the toys are shocked when they hear from Andy that Woody has gone missing. She comforts a saddened Slinky and tells him she hopes Woody's okay.

The next day, She is surprised to see Woody in Sid's room. Bo asks Woody what he is doing there, to which Woody tells her that he'll explain later. He then tosses the gang Christmas lights across so Buzz and Woody can shimmy to Andy's window. But Mr. Potato Head holds the lights away from the gang, telling them that they can't just forget about what Woody did to Buzz. Woody tells them Buzz is with him, to which Mr. Potato Head asks him to prove it. Woody then uses Buzz's arm (which broke off after Buzz unsuccessfully tried flying) by hiding it behind the window and impersonates Buzz. But then Woody accidentally pulls Buzz's arm into the toy's view, and Bo screams in horror. Worriedly facing the possibility that Mr. Potato Head was right about Woody, she walks away from the window, trying not to think about it. The night before Moving Day, Bo watches a depressed Andy sleep while clutching onto his cowboy hat. Bo then whispers how if only Woody could see how much Andy misses him.

Later the next day, after the toys, under the orders of Mr. Potato Head, throw Woody out of the moving truck, thinking he was only trying to get rid of R.C, Bo Peep was unable to do anything to stop them, but then Lenny the binoculars catches sight of Woody riding R.C with Buzz. Bo picks up Lenny and looks through his eyes to indeed see Woody, Buzz, and R.C catching up to the van and Buzz's arm fixed. Bo confirms to the gang that Woody was telling the truth, to which the now guilt-ridden toys band together to rescue them.

A few months later, it is a snowy Christmas morning and as the gang parties and listens to Mr. Potato Head karaoke, Hamm tells everyone Sarge has a view of the kids' presents. Woody follows the gang but is once again pulled back by a bonnet-less Bo. Woody tells her there must be a better way to get his attention, but Bo nonchalantly wishes him a merry Christmas and points upward with her cane. Woody looks upon the bookshelf and notices her sheep-holding mistletoe, to which a smug Bo drops her cane, grabs the cowboy, and smothers him with kisses. Soon, Woody (now covered with kiss marks across his face) sits next to Buzz on the bed and listens along with the gang as they hear Andy excitedly getting a new puppy for Christmas, shocking all of them.

Toy Story 2
Unlike the rest of Andy's toys, who were upgraded to a larger role than the original film, Bo Peep remains a minor character, only appearing at the beginning and end. She first appears when the toys search for Woody's lost hat. Bo, her sheep, and Molly's troll doll arrive in Andy's room, saying his hat isn't in Molly's room, despite looking everywhere. As Woody becomes upset, saying this will be the first time he'll miss Cowboy Camp, all because of his hat, Bo tried to cheer him up by reminding him that Andy will take Woody regardless of his missing hat. Woody then apologizes and explains that the camp means a lot to him since it is the one time in the year he can be alone with Andy, which causes Bo to pull him closer to her with her crook, and she calls him cute for caring. Embarrassed, Woody tells her not to do it in front of Buzz, but Bo simply tells him "to let him look". The two are about to kiss when they see Bo's sheep in a tug-of-war with Rex and his gaming system.

Slinky then announces that he has found Woody's hat with Andy's rambunctious puppy, and Buster begins to approach Andy's room, so the Green Army Men and Rocky Gibraltar hold the door while Bo tells Woody to quickly hide. Despite the toys' best efforts, the dog charges into the room and finds Woody. Andy soon arrives, and when he decides to squeeze in one last playtime before he leaves, he once again makes Bo the damsel of distress, being held hostage by Evil Dr. Porkchop (Hamm). Porkchop tells Woody to choose Bo's fate: Eaten by sharks or death by monkeys. But Woody says he chooses Buzz Lightyear, so Buzz arrives and knocks Porkchop off his pedestal while Woody rescues Bo Peep. She then professes her love by kissing him.

After Andy accidentally rips Woody's arm and decides not to take him to the camp, the toys try to call out to a saddened Woody that was left on a shelf, and Bo asks if he's okay. Woody doesn't answer and pulls his dangling legs up from their view, causing Bo and Buzz to share a look of worry. The next morning, when Woody attempts to save Wheezy from being sold by Mrs. Davis, she and the other toys witness Al taking and drive away with Woody, and Bo Peep asks why someone would steal Woody.

Later that afternoon, Bo and the other toys examine what happened by making a diorama, and Hamm (with the help of Etch A Sketch) makes a presentation, trying to create a sketch of the "kidnapper". Bo points out that he didn't have a beard and that he wore glasses. Eventually, they discover that the man was the chicken mascot from the Al's Toy Barn commercial.

Before the toys leave to rescue Woody, Bo walks up to Buzz and kisses him on the cheek, saying it is for Woody when they find him. Buzz blushes and awkwardly agrees but says he doesn't think Woody will get it directly from him. Buzz says he will do his best as Bo smiles. She joins in on the other toys waving goodbye to the main five walking across the roof to find Woody.

She is not seen until the end of the film, where the group returns with not only Woody, but also with Jessie, Bullseye, and the Aliens. She watches Woody admiring his newly fixed arm done by Andy. When Woody says he did a great job and flexes his arm, saying it's nice and strong, Bo squeezes it and says she also likes it, saying it makes him look tough, causing Woody to giggle. Wheezy, now fixed with a new squeaker, says to Bo and Woody that he feels well and feels a song coming on. As Wheezy grabs Mr. Mike's microphone and sings You've Got a Friend in Me, Bo, Woody, Buzz, and Jessie soon watch together from the desk as Wheezy finishes his number.

Toy Story 3
Bo only appears in the background in the home videos of Andy playing with the toys. She is later mentioned by Woody during their final staff meeting. Woody says that the main gang is still together despite losing their friends to the past yard sales and spring cleanings. He uses Wheezy and Etch A Sketch as examples, and Rex awkwardly adds Bo Peep to the list, which visibly saddens Woody.

Toy Story 4
Bo Peep returns in Toy Story 4 with a major role. In the film, it is revealed she is indeed Molly's toy and part of a lamp, despite this detail not receiving mention in the first two films. It is also revealed exactly how Bo came to be separated from Andy's Toys about seven years prior to the events of Toy Story 3.

Nine years prior to the events of Toy Story 4 and roughly 3 years after Toy Story 2, Woody, Buzz, Jessie, and Slinky rush to Molly's room to enlist Bo to help them rescue RC, who is stuck in a flowing storm drain during a thunderstorm on a rainy day. She and Woody immediately come up with a rescue which they call "Operation Pull Toy". Under Bo's command, Molly's toys create a catapult and launch Jessie into the air so she can unlock the window. After locating R.C, Bo straightens Woody's hat and he jumps out the window with Slinky's front half. When Bo sees they cannot get close enough to reach R.C., she quickly uses the entire Barrel of Monkeys linked together and hooked onto her staff and adds them to Slinky's line giving Woody the boost he needs. The toys quickly pull them back up, but just as they get R.C. into the bedroom, Andy's mom comes in and closes the window before Woody can get inside. Bo, her sheep, and their lamp are placed in a box and given away to a man who takes the box to his car in the rain. When he runs back to the house for one of his forgotten possessions, Woody attempts to assist Bo and her sheep in an escape attempt, in hopes of returning them to Andy's room; but she assures him that being taken away is part of being a toy. Bo tries to convince Woody to come with her and although Woody is tempted, hearing Andy calling his name convinces him to stay with the Toys, ultimately parting with Bo.

Since leaving the antique store, Bo has chosen to live a life of adventure in the outside world. Bo now sports a pink bow in her hair, and now wears the light blue undergarments she was previously seen wearing under her dress, along with several noticeable cosmetic injuries, indicated by the bandages on her upper right arm, left wrist, and her shepherdess crook, where the porcelain suffered numerous cracks. She spent several years living in an antique store, helping the lost toys who passed through find new homes there. She has lost her bonnet and frock while opting to use her dress (which is reversible) as a cape when rescuing the lost toys.

Woody encounters Bo while on a road trip with his new toy owner, Bonnie Anderson. The encounter takes place while trying to retrieve Forky, resulting in the discovery of a rather expansive playground. After observing the numerous toys who call the playground home, Woody stumbles across one very familiar shepherdess – his long lost Bo. Bo is there with many other lost toys waiting to play with the kids who exit their bus route at the playground stop. Though the two are happy to see each other again after so many years, they discover that they now have different philosophies concerning what it means to be a toy. Bo's new friends include Giggle McDimples, Duke Caboom, and many others, who aid Woody in retrieving Forky and returning him to his home. They rally Buzz, Duke Caboom, Ducky, and Bunny on their rescue mission, entering the antique shop in search of Forky. Gabby Gabby and her Bensons force the group to leave the antique shop without Forky once again, and Bo consequently denounces any further rescue attempts in the interest of the safety of the group.

Sometime later, when Giggle insults Woody, Bo remembers how loyal Woody is. Because of this, Bo decides to return to the antique shop, and (along with Duke, Ducky, and Bunny) she eventually regroups with Woody, Forky, and Gabby. The group collectively departs the shop to return to Bonnie's RV. The toys climb atop the nearby carnival's Ferris wheel, and with Bo's encouragement and Duke's riding skills, the group continues toward the agreed rallying location.

The rest of the group meets with Buzz after he successfully pilots Bonnie's RV to the carousel, where the Toys exchange bittersweet farewells. Ducky, Bunny, and Duke Caboom say goodbye to Woody as he approaches the RV to return to Bonnie and the Toys. But after Buzz advises Woody to follow his heart, Woody decides he cannot leave Bo once again. Woody sprints back to Bo, and the two tightly embrace each other just as the rest of the toys come up. Before Woody leaves for good, he and Bo turn to the others, and they both embrace and bid a final farewell to their friends.

Bo and Woody watch as the other toys pull away in Bonnie's RV. Bo and her newly reunited deputy direct their gaze over the ever-expansive world they now share as home.

Lamp Life
After she was given away, she went to be the lamp of two little girls. Unlike what Mrs. Davis did with Andy, their mom wouldn't let them play with Bo or the sheep separately, so they played with her in secret until they outgrew her and gave her away. There, she had several interesting owners until she was just left outside on a street when she was found and placed in the Antique Store. One day, she overheard Harmony's mother talking about taking Harmony to a park, and desperate for a play, she snuck out and had a play. Eventually, she realized her calling was helping lost toys find owners, so she ditched her pink dress, replaced them with blue bloomers, and has been helping toys ever since.

Trivia
Bo Peep is a reference to the fairy tale The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen. This story was also about toys in a child's room coming to life when no one is looking.
Even though she belongs to Molly, Bo Peep has been considered to be one of Andy's toys - being played with by Andy and even being labeled as "Andy's Toys" on a bonus feature on the 2005 Toy Story 1 and 2 DVDs.
Bo Peep is a playable character on Toy Story Racer.
The original logic to Bo Peep never joining on adventures throughout the Toy Story franchise was due to her fragile porcelain nature, which put her at constant risk of being damaged or killed more so than the other, more durable toys. Ironically, by Toy Story 4, Bo has developed a more adventurous personality and constantly puts herself at risk through parkour and rescue missions for the good of others.
Despite being made of porcelain, Bo Peep is shown wearing a different outfit in the present day of Toy Story 4, which she is implied to have always had under her original dress. This suggests that while Bo herself is made of porcelain, her outfit was actual fabric.
By the present day, Bo has become visibly damaged. Her right arm is broken at the bicep, her left arm broken at the forearm, and her Shepherd's crook is broken towards the top and secured with the wiring. Bo keeps her broken body held together with bandages, which when attached securely allow her to maneuver her broken limbs. The tape does have a tendency to fail, in one such case causing Woody to inadvertently pull her arm off. While this horrified Woody, Bo simply laughed at the incident, claiming it "happens all the time."

She was named as Betty in the Latin American Spanish dubs of the first three films, though the dub of the fourth film she was named as her original name.
Even though she is Woody's love interest, many confuse Jessie to be Woody's girlfriend. So much so that there are couples costumes of Woody and Jessie that couples wear.
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (or PETA) asked Disney that they remove the shepherd's crook from Bo Peep for the fourth film as it indicates her dominance over animals. This request went unheeded. However, it was referenced by Marge Simpson when she dressed as Bo for a Disney+ promo.
Bo Peep appears in the show Once Upon a Time, but is portrayed as a villain rather than a hero.
