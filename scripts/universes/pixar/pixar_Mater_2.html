<html><p>During the credits' roll of Cars 2, Mater's passport scrolls past. His birth date is listed on it. It turns out to be the same as John Lasseter's: January 12, 1957.
This would mean Mater was 49 years old in the first movie.
This would mean Mater was 49 years old in the first movie.
During the last section of the World Grand Prix, Mater is described as the world's greatest backwards driver.
It is revealed in Time Travel Mater that he always cries at weddings. This is probably due to having a very emotional and sensitive personality.
Mater breaks the fourth wall in the first movie: During the closing song "Route 66", he can be seen in the crowd looking at the viewers while singing some verses of the soundtrack.
In the credits, it is shown that he is knighted on Tuesday, July 15, 2011. However, July 15, 2011, was not on Tuesday in real life, it was on Friday.
In the subtitles for the audio commentary on Cars 2, John Lasseter describes Mater with "two miniguns" but the subtitles say "two many guns".
Mater was the only resident of Raidator Springs who had no dislike of Lighting McQueen when he first arrived even outright saying that he liked him when he was in the impound lot.
Head of story and co-director Joe Ranft got the inspiration of Mater after seeing an old abandoned rusty tow truck during a research trip to Route 66. The character was named after and partly based on Douglas "Mater" Keever, a racing fan the Pixar team met during their research trips, and also draws inspiration from several other people the team encountered.
Mater's name has been changed in many other language dubs:
In Arabic, he is called "ماطم" (Matem).
In Spanish and Portuguese, he is called "Mate".
In French, he is called "Martin".
In Polish, Mater is called "Złomek" (z-wom-eh-k).
In German, he is called "Hook".
In Dutch, he is called "Takel".
In Italian, he is called "Carl Attrezzi", a pun on "carro attrezzi", which means "tow truck"; however, he is more often referred to with his nickname "Cricchetto", from the car tool "cric".
In Swedish, he is called "Bärgarn", which suits him since he is a tow truck.
In Japanese, he is called "メーター" (me-ta-).
In Mandarin (Taiwan), he is called "拖線".
In Mandarin (China), he is called "板牙".
In Cantonese, he is called "哨牙嘜".
In Danish, he is called "Bumle".
In Bulgarian, he is called Матю (Matthew).
In Hungarian, he is called Matuka.
In Russian, he is called "Мэтр" (metre).
In Finnish, he is called "Martti".
In Arabic, he is called "ماطم" (Matem).

In Finnish, he is called "Martti".
According to the Cars 2 DVD commentary, Lasseter wanted Mater to be the only one to know that Miles Axlerod was behind the conspiracy to sabotage the World Grand Prix so everyone could see him go from being to the dumbest guy in the world to the most brilliant guy in the world.
Mater's horn sounds different in the Disney Infinity series when it is compared to the sound made in the films. Additionally, in the sequels to the first game, some of his quotes are missing, including the sounds he makes when doing air tricks. To add to that, the third game has a few of the sounds that he makes when side-bashing absent, as well as the subtitles not covering any of his quotes. It is currently unknown if all of this will be fixed in an update patch of the game.
Mater is an American, but in reality, only people from the United Kingdom can get knighted. However, non-Britishers can receive honorary knighthoods, but that does not mean they can be referred to as "Sir".
When Mater was an 8 year old child (in the Our Town Cars flashback), all of his body was painted baby blue, today however, his doors are more like a light green pastel color instead of baby blue like the rest of his paint in his youth.
In Cars 3, Mater has a bunch of flaps that he collects. He has mud flaps, fishing flaps, church flaps, and going out to eat flaps.
Head of story and co-director Joe Ranftgot the inspiration of Mater after seeing an old abandoned rusty tow truck during a research trip to Route 66. The character was named after and partly based on Douglas "Mater" Keever, a racing fan the Pixar team met during their research trips, and also draws inspiration from several other people the team encountered.
Mater's license plate is A113, a recurring code in Pixar films.
If you listen to the way Mater talks real closely, you can see that he talks with a lisp to his voice (as he talks, the air kind of whistles through the gap between his buck teeth) and he doesn't say 'this', he usually says, "dis, dat" and among others along with a "z" at the end of a word like "carz" rather than saying "cars".
One thing to note throughout the series is that Mater's characteristics and loving nature are very similar to that of a domesticated dog.
It is noted by John Lasseter that Mater is way too innocent, pure and kind so he can never hurt or harm any soul. He can't even kill a bumblebee without mourning for its life (in fact, this was shown in the Cars teaser trailer).
Larry the Cable Guy mentioned that Mater isn't self-conscious about how others view him.
Mater is one of those sensitive guy types. He tends to act and behave more on the feminine side than a macho strong man.
Also, it is noted in the Cars books, like "Mater's Birthday Surprise" and in "Mater and the Easter Buggy", that his favorite colors are mostly, blue, green, orange, yellow, and most defiantly pink and purple (more of the lighter softer colors). He also likes the color red.
During the last section of the World Grand Prix, Mater is described as the World's greatest backwards driver.
Mater is one of the believers in Jesus because he has church flaps and he goes to church.
One of his catchphrases is "Git-R-Done!" his actor, Larry the Cable Guy's signature phrase.
Many fans speculate that Mater is somewhere on the autism spectrum. This is due to his tendency to self-stimulate, his encyclopedia-like knowledge, his sensory processing issues, his inability to socialize, and his blindness to sarcasm.
Many fans speculate that Mater's biological parents are Lizzie and Stanley. He behaves like both of them and he has the same big buck teeth and goofy droopy eyes as Stanley. His speech pattern is a mix between Stanley's southern accent and Lizzie's voice. He forgets easily and is really crazy like Lizzie. It all makes sense. He also says yes siree, oh apple sauce, and Dad-Gum like Stanley used to say. His horn is also mixed between Lizzie's long deep horn and Stanley's short loud horn. His kindhearted nature comes from both Lizzie's and Stanley's kindhearted natures. So, Tow Mater looks physically like his dad, Stanley and he acts and behaves more akin to his mom, Lizzie. Tow Mater has always been a mama's boy.
The country bumpkin tow truck Mater got his name from NASCAR superfan Douglas “Mater” Keever, whom the filmmakers met while on a research trip to North Carolina’s Lowe’s Motor Speedway (now called the Charlotte Motor Speedway). Keever has a voice cameo in the film, as the motor home who says “Well dip me in axle grease and call me slick” early in the film. (Keever improvised the line, which was originally “Well dip me in axle grease and call me lubrication.” Producer Darla Anderson opted to change it, Keveerspeculated, because “maybe she thought it sounded sexual, I don’t know.”)
His concept name was Tom.
His concept name was also Zeb.
His concept name was also Zeb.
