Season One


–Star-Burns, "Romantic Expressionism".
Star-Burns is first seen in Spanish class and is given his nickname by Chang. At the Halloween party, he mistakenly believes Pierce's daily medications are illegal drugs and trades one of his own drugs for two of them. It's revealed he is a member of the campus' "cool" study group and he considers Troy and Abed (along with Pierce's) application for membership into the elite circle. On Valentine's Day he shaves the sideburns to look like hearts making him "Heart-Burns". Star-Burns makes a creepy comment about Annie much to the disgust of Jeff and Britta. His son stops by Greendale for the "Family Day" event the school throws. He attends Boating class with Britta, Troy, Shirley and Pierce. His job was to man the "iron jenny" which meant driving the flat bed trailer the sail boat was attached to. Star-Burns popularity is revealed to be tied to his job as the cafeteria fry cook and his access to the most popular food item on the menu: Chicken Fingers. He teams up with Pierce in the episode "Modern Warfare" for the school's annual game of Paintball Assassin. When Pierce sees that Troy, Abed and Jeff have formed an alliance he eliminates Star-Burns to join them. At the end of the school year, he is at the "Tranny Dance" and witnesses the love triangle showdown for Jeff's affections between Michelle Slater and Britta.

He shoots Abed with a paintball weapon which teleports him to Evil Jeff's alternate reality. Abed finds himself in the Darkest Timelines version of Dean Pelton's office where he encounters the fake dean.

Relationships
Star-Burns appears to have a strained relationship with the study group. He and Jeff Winger in particular appear to have some kind of rivalry, both describing the other as a "douchebag", likely due to his ogling of Annie Edison. In Anthropology class, Star-Burns reminisces about the time in which the study group went on a rafting trip, and how nice it was to have a class not about them. The study group ousts him from his job as a chicken fry-cook during "Contemporary American Poultry." In spite of all this, he and Pierce appear to be friends, trading drugs in "Intro to Statistics" and teaming up together during "Modern Warfare".

Ben Chang loves to mock him, drawing constant attention to the time it must take him to carve stars into his sideburns. After Chang becomes a student, an unspecified incident causes him to owe Chang a small frozen pizza.

Star-Burns has one son, who despite his father's laid back appearance, appears to be a successful businessman. He was married to a woman named Magda, to whom he gave herpes. In his video will, he confirms this saying, "To my ex-wife, Magda, I leave herpes, but she knows that."



Class history


Trivia
His age is somewhat vague:
In Season Two, Abed and Troy presented his age on his information card as 46 years old (born in 1965), a supporter of legalization, of Cambodian ethnicity and with the DJ nickname, Sparkles ("Intro to Political Science").
When he faked his death in Season Three however, Abed made him a memorial video that stated he was born in 1972, making him 41-40 years old, instead of 46 ("Course Listing Unavailable").
In Season Six, Star-Burns himself says he is 50, which falls in line with Troy and Abed's information card about him from Season Two and contradicts the memorial video from Season Three ("Modern Espionage").

He is prone to stealing backpacks that are left unguarded ("Basic Lupine Urology").
He is an avid user of pills and marijuana.
He had somewhat of a friendly relationship with Pierce, to the point where he traded narcotics for Pierce's legitimate medication ("Introduction to Statistics").
He almost always wears the same vest, and uses "some kind of crystal instead of deodorant" according to Abed, which does not work, if Annie's reaction to the smell of his vest is any indication ("For A Few Paintballs More").
He is a huge fan of the band Styx ("Course Listing Unavailable").
The evolution of Star-Burn's appearance after his return in Season Five repeats the one from the beginning of the series: while in Season Five he no longer has the hat or the bearded dragon and mostly looks like he did in Season One ("Geothermal Escapism"), Season Six sees the return of his hat from Season Two ("Modern Espionage").
In Communication Studies, he is seen wearing glasses while in the background as Chang emasculates Troy and Pierce
