Piercinald Anastasia "Pierce" Hawthorne (portrayed by Chevy Chase) was a former moist towelette tycoon who was at one time the C.E.O of "Hawthorne Wipes". The company was founded by his father, Cornelius Hawthorne, and it afforded Pierce a leisurely lifestyle. In his younger years, he lived it up, marrying seven times and accumulating over thirty step-children. However, later in life, he found himself alone and unhappy. In an attempt to cure his malaise, he started several hobbies including traveling the world, moving to Canada during the Vietnam War, becoming a Toastmaster, performing magic, and playing the piano. In 1999 he returned to school to further expand his horizons and enrolled in  Greendale Community College. He stayed for over a decade before finally graduating in 2013. In his final years at school, he joined a Spanish study group and despite a few rocky moments they became his longest lasting friendships. With their help, he coped with the death of both his parents, discovered that his father's assistant Gilbert Lawson was his half-brother and dealt with being fired as Hawthorne Wipes C.E.O by the board of directors. During this time he became an entrepreneur and invested his money in various businesses. This included fellow study group member Shirley Bennet's  sandwich shop in which he became a co-owner. Pierce passed away not long after he and the study group officially graduated from school. Before his death he built a Gender Sensitivity and Sexual Potency museum on the Greendale campus. He also finalized his will leaving behind specific bequeathals to his friends in the study group which included a special complimentary gift.

Class history


Relationships
In the study group
Pierce's place within the study group was best described by Abed as being the scapegoat. Much like Britta, he was a common target for the group to make fun of. In Pierce's case this was due to advanced age and his offensive opinions on race, religion and sex. These made him the perfect lightning rod for criticism and also diverted attention away from any other study group being mocked. Pierce himself believed his role in the group was to be the person willing to say or do what the others won't. His somewhat antagonistic role caused him to often be excluded from a number of group activities.  

Other notable relationships
