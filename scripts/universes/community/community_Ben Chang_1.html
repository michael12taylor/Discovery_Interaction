Bio
Benjamin Franklin "Ben" Chang, (portrayed by actor Ken Jeong) is a long time employee of Greendale Community College who has worked at the school in various capacities. His known family includes a mother who refused to breast feed him as a child, a deceased twin sister named Connie whom he claimed to have eaten in utero and a brother known only as Rabbi Chang. He was also at one time happily married to woman named Alessandra. Chang started his nearly decade long association with Greendale as a Spanish teacher. This job came to an end after an anonymous source revealed to Dean Pelton that he faked his teaching credentials. Chang was immediately fired but was allowed to enroll at the school as a music student with hopes of also earning a legitimate teaching degree. However, his personal life took a turn for the worse when he and his wife got divorced. This was due to him having gotten roofied and having an affair with another student at a Halloween party. He was kicked out and after a brief stay at Jeff Wingers apartment, eventually took up residence in the Greendale ventilation system. Dean Pelton learned about his situation and hired him to be a campus security guard. Chang grew mentally unstable during this time and used his job to stage a coup d'état and took over the school. After his "regime" came to an end, he returned to the school months later claiming to have amnesia. He was gradually accepted back and Shirley even employed him at her sandwich shop. Ultimately, he eventually dropped the ruse, went to jail for his crimes, and was put in a work-release program employed at Greendale as a math teacher. His current position at school is unknown, but he is now officially a member of the "Save Greendale Committee". Chang's hobbies include paintball, playing keytar, riding his scooter, and snowboarding. He also used to swim regularly at the local YMCA.

Character history
Season One


–Ben Chang, "English as a Second Language".
During the 2009-2010 semester at Greendale, Chang first met the study group with whom he would have a strained relationship over the years. He also began a petty feud with Dr. Ian Duncan whom he felt had no respect for him. He had a brief separation from his wife which his student Jeff Winger helped bring to a happy resolution. Chang's poor relationship with his brother, Rabbi Chang, was revealed during the school's Family Day event. He later participated in the school's annual Paintball Assassin contest as a ringer sent in by Dean Pelton to prevent the students from winning the prize. As the year came to a close, Chang had concerns that his fraudulent qualifications as a Spanish teacher would be exposed and sought advice from Jeff about obtaining more faked credentials. Unbeknownst to him Annie would later learn about this due to her having left a Dictaphone behind which recorded their private conversation. Annie tipped off Dean Pelton and Chang's career as a Spanish teacher came to an end. He blamed Winger and went to the parking lot to wreck Jeff's Lexus with his keytar. Annie later came forward as the guilty party and managed to convince Chang to enroll at Greendale and earn a legit degree. After officially becoming a student, Chang went to see Ian Duncan and asked him to help him cheat his way through school. The professor laughed in his face and ruthlessly mocked Chang. The taunting continued when they both attended the end of the year school function called "The Tranny Dance". Chang had to restrain himself from physically assaulting Duncan lest he be expelled from school for hitting a teacher. It wasn't until after Duncan got himself suspended that Chang got a roll of quarters and punched Ian in the face.

Nunez to resign over the cover up. Chang was promoted to Nunez's position and recruited a group of preteens to be his campus security force called "The Changlourious Basterds".

Trivia
Sexuality
While he revealed that he was gay only in the closing scene of the series, there have been multiple hints about his non-heterosexuality:

In Spanish 101 and Advanced Criminal Law Chang displays an overt fondness for a student named "Toby" who sits in front. He brushes his cheek both times
In Environmental Science, as Chang cries, he nestles into Jeff's chest, saying, "Let me just rest on your pecs". He constantly fondles them for much of the scene.
In Communication Studies, he makes Troy and Pierce dress up in feminine pantsuits and dance with him. Chang is very clearly into it, even slapping Troy's ass while dancing. He then takes Pierce on his moped to get froyo, and seems upset that Troy couldn't join.
In Advanced Gay, he goes home with a drag queen, deriding Jeff for not having anyone for the night. Additionally, he is shown spending time with stripper policemen, asking them, "How long you guys been on the force?"
In Geothermal Escapism, he readily reveals that his same-sex celebrity crush is Nathon Fillon, without really saying much else
This is also meant as a meta joke since Nathan Fillon would later guest star
This is also meant as a meta joke since Nathan Fillon would later guest star
In Grifting 101, when Britta mentions "reverse pissing contest", Chang says, "Is that where you suck it back up in your ... sorry I've only ever done it the other way". Annie asks, "You mean peeing?" to which Chang responds, "No, I mean in the back."
Notes
Ben loves Latin culture and salsa - dancing and the dip, especially Colombian timba and spicy mango, respectively.("[]")
Ben uses his last name in place of regular words as a running gag; see the article "Changuage" for a complete list of puns.
Ben is afraid of hamsters as revealed in "Epidemiology", and in "The Science of Illusion", it's revealed that he also has a fear of frogs.
As revealed in Modern Warfare, Ben plays paintball three times a week and owns his own equipment, consisting of a full automatic with a tiger camo print and two golden pistols.
Ben is of Chinese heritage.
In Season One's "Investigative Journalism", it is shown that Ben is born in 1969 but in Season Three's "The First Chang Dynasty" it is said that he is 25 years of age. This of course is obviously false, as that would mean he was 16 or 17 years old when he began teaching at Greendale.
Ben has a different role at Greendale in each season.
Spanish teacher (Season One).
Greendale student (Season Two).
Security guard (Season Three).
Amnesiac (Season Four).
