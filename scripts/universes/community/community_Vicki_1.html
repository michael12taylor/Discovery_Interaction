During the 2010 semester of Greendale, Vice President Biden decided to visit Greendale on his tour of community colleges. A quick election was set up to determine the student body president and Vicki was accidentally selected to run. During a debate between the other candidates, Vicki was repeatedly insulted by Pierce until she dropped out of the race. Pierce revealed the only reason he ran was to get back at her for not lending him a pencil. She finally lent him a pencil by stabbing him in the face with one. 
Later, Vicki takes an acting class, but her attempts to stand out are ruined by Troy who steals her spotlight. She shyly flirted with Neil during an Anthropology class where Shirley later went into labor and gave birth to her son Ben. At the end of the 2011 school year, Vicki chooses not to participate in the paintball assassin organised by City College and took haven in the safe zone created by Pierce, entertaining the other refugees by table-dancing.

"A Fistful of Paintballs": Vicki is a citizen of Fort Hawthorne located in the cafeteria who is paid in vending machine Twinkies to entertain the refugees by table dancing. She becomes one of the few survivors when a City College-sponsored player eliminates most of the fort's denizens.

Vicki returned for another year at Greendale during the 2011 Fall semester. She enrolled in Biology 101 and Magnitude was made her partner for her first lab project. Thanks to his charisma, Doctor Kane praised their presentation, although Vicki would later run into problems with a solo assignment. This was a result of her relationship with Neil, which had developed into a romantic one. Neil was eager for them to spend the summer together and took extraordinary measures to ensure she passed Biology. A scandal ensued due to his actions which prevented this from happening, as everyone in class was forced to retake the course. Vicki also attended a memorial service in the cafeteria being held in honor of the recently departed Alex "Star-Burns" Osbourne. At the event the study group whipped the crowd into a frenzy an incited a riot. Vicki took part in the violence by helping to trash the new Subway restaurant.

"Basic Lupine Urology": Vicki finds herself at the center of the mystery surrounding the sabotage of the study group's Biology yam project. She briefly becomes a suspect when it's revealed by Jeff that all the other students' projects have been tampered with except for Vicki's. Her boyfriend Neil quickly confesses that he was the one responsible; he manipulated the experiments' results, so that the grade curve for the project would be lowered, and Vicki's yam would receive a passing grade. His main motivation, beyond her passing the course, was to prevent Vicki from having to take summer school to make up for the class, allowing her to spend that time with Neil in his parents' cabin.

"Course Listing Unavailable": She was next seen in the cafeteria at the Star-burns wake. Because of Marshall Kane's resignation, all the students taking his course received an incomplete and were obliged to retake the course in summer school.

For the 2012 Fall semester at Greendale, Vicki and Neil were set to take the class "History of Ice Cream" together.

At one point she and Neil teamed up for a tango contest but lost to Jeff and Dean Pelton.

Pierce noticed it and bluntly asked them, "Are you two going to fall in love with each other or something?". Vicki is revealed to be officially dating Neil in Basic Lupine Urology. Neil went so far as to sabotage the other classmates' yam projects just for Vicki's sake, declaring "God help me, I did it for love!".
