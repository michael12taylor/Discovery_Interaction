Troy Barnes is a graduate from both Riverside High School and Greendale Community College. A popular figure at Riverside, Troy was the star quarterback of the football team and also the prom king. His many admirers at school included his fellow classmate Annie Edison who would later join him at Greendale and eventually become his roommate. At the time, he had the interest of many elite universities but couldn't handle the pressure of other people's expectations. The night before a big game, which was attended by college recruiters, he intentionally injured himself (either by dislocating both of his shoulders or faking a knee injury as  accounts vary) while doing a keg flip at a party. With few options for a higher education, he considered Greendale after being handed a promotional flyer by Ben Chang while at the frozen yogurt place. Troy later admitted he chose the school because it was close to his house and because he saw a late night commercial for Greendale in which had a student giving a thumbs up sign in a "cool way." While at GCC he grew very close to a study group he joined, particularly Abed Nadir who became his best friend and Britta Perry whom he dated for a year. After graduating from college, he briefly re-enrolled some time later in order to discover who he was. When his fellow study group member Pierce Hawthorne passed away, Troy was offered a chance to win his fortune by completing a sailing trip around the world. Troy accepted the challenge and said goodbye to his friends before he left on the boat with his childhood idol LeVar Burton. A news report suggests that while on the trip Troy and LeVar Burton were taken hostage by pirates. His current whereabouts are unknown.
