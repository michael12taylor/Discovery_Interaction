Annie Edison (portrayed by Alison Brie) is a graduate of Greendale Community College. She is the daughter of a Jewish mother and an Episcopalian father. Her parents divorced and she, along with her brother Anthony, were raised by their mother. At a very young age, Annie's mother pushed her hard to succeed academically. In her teens, she attended Riverside High School along with her then crush Troy Barnes. She ended up losing her college scholarship (and her virginity) and dropped out of high school due to an addiction to Adderall. Her drug abuse led to a nervous breakdown that culminated in her jumping through a plate glass window and suffering severe injuries. Her mother wanted to ignore the incident, but Annie chose to confront the addiction and go to rehab. As a result, Annie became estranged from her family and eventually moved out. She began attending Greendale Community College at the age of 18, and it's hinted that one of the main reasons is because Troy was going there. During her time at college she became close friends with him and their Spanish study group. After four years, she graduated and ironically got a job with a pharmaceutical company. She unexpectedly reunited with her study group and decided to re-enroll to pursue a degree in Forensics. Along with her friends, she also joined a group formed to improve campus life called the "Save Greendale Committee". At the end of the 2015 Spring semester she left Greendale to participate in an internship she was offered with the F.B.I. over the summer break.

Relationships
In the the study group
