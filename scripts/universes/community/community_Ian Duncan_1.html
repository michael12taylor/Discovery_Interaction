Bio
Dr. Ian Duncan (portrayed by actor/comedian John Oliver) is a psychology professor at Greendale Community College. Ian was born in Birmingham, England and grew up on 52nd street in the Islington district of London (although this is actually a writing error as confirmed by Dan Harmon, as British streets are not numbered). His mother was a native of Lincolnshire, from a town called Scunthorpe where she worked as a whore at a Stansbury pub with her thumb-less sister. Duncan's father was absent for much of his childhood and it's alluded that he left England shortly after his parents divorced. He came to America with his grandfather when he was very young and eventually became a psychologist. He was hired by Greendale Community College and was made the head of its psychology department. Duncan started drinking heavily and his addiction caused him to run into some legal problems. At one point during driving drunk, he tried to order chalupas from an emergency call box on a highway. Jeff Winger was still a practicing attorney at the time and managed to get Ian off the hook. The two became drinking buddies, and, years later when Jeff enrolled at Greendale, he unsuccessfully tried to call upon the favor Ian owed him. Although Duncan was present during Jeff's first and second year at school, he took a leave of absence before his friend graduated. He spent that time back in England taking care of his mother who was ill. Duncan returned to his position at Greendale a few years later and reconnected with Jeff, who had since become a member of the faculty.

Personality
Character history
Season One


–Chang arguing to Duncan, "Advanced Criminal Law".
At the start of the Fall 2009 semester at Greendale, Ian reunited with his old friend Jeff Winger, who was also his lawyer several years ago. Jeff was now disbarred due to him faking his qualifications and had enrolled at Greendale and asked Duncan to help him cheat to earn a legitimate degree. Duncan refused, unwilling to let Jeff continue in his dishonest ways, and unsuccessfully tried to teach him a lesson. In class, Duncan attempted to validate his "Duncan Principle" theory during one of his psych labs. However, he found his efforts hindered by an unexpected participant, Abed Nadir. 

As part of the faculty he served on a tribunal made up of him, Dean Pelton, and Ben Chang to deal with Britta Perry who had cheated on her Spanish exam. The outcome had him volunteering to provide Britta free therapy to deal with her neuroses. Throughout the rest of the school year he had an antagonistic relationship with Ben Chang. By the end of the year Chang had been fired due to his teaching credentials having been faked. He was now a student at school and Duncan took great delight in taunting him. At the end of the year transfer dance Duncan found himself suspended by Dean Pelton when he made a drunk spectacle of himself. Since he was no longer officially on staff, Duncan got assaulted by Chang.



In 2009, Duncan was surprised to see his former lawyer and drinking buddy Jeff Winger enrolled at Greendale who had been disbarred until he earned a legitimate degree. Since Duncan owed Jeff for helping him get out of a D.U.I. charge years ago he asks that Ian get him every test answer that semester. Duncan balks at the request and tries to talk Jeff out of continuing his cycle of cheating to get ahead. After Jeff continued his demands Duncan made acquiesced but only on the condition that Jeff give him his Lexus. Ian also offered his own mini coup in exchange as part of the bargain so Jeff could have a vehicle. Jeff reluctantly agreed but afterwards discovered that Duncan just gives him an envelope of blank paper. Duncan was enjoying a glass of wine when a Jeff stormed into his office grabbed his car keys furious that Ian tried to teach him a lesson ("Pilot")

Duncan set up a psych lab and invited his top students to help prove his hypothesis, "The Duncan Principle." He posited that the longer a subject was left to wait for something the more dramatic the person's subsequent breakdown would be. Annie Edison managed to join Duncan's pupils in observing the experiment and recruited her friends Troy Barnes and Abed Nadir to participate. Duncan allowed her to start the lab once all the test subjects were gathered in one room. Ian was amused when one of the guinea pigs, Ben Chang, immediately went berserk and stormed out. As the hours passed the room emptied and only Abed remained which frustrated Duncan. Furious that Abed wouldn't leave, Duncan angrily criticized Annie for bringing him. His class then started to document his breakdown which made Duncan cancel the experiment and end the test lab ("Social Psychology").

Duncan served on a faculty tribunal alongside Dean Pelton and Ben Chang to deal with Britta Perry who cheated on a Spanish exam. The trial was being held in Borchert Hall at the edge of the swimming pool. Duncan and Chang's animosity towards each other reappeared as the two continually sniped at each other. During the recess they went off to clear the air between them. They argued all the way into the shower stalls in the men's locker rooms where Chang revealed he felt continually disrespected by Duncan. Their conversation was interrupted when they realized there was an overweight naked man showering in front of them. Back at the trial, Duncan and the rest of the tribunal were swayed by Jeff's argument that Britta should not be expelled for her actions. Duncan decided that she should instead be sentenced to a year's worth of therapy sessions conducted by him ("Advanced Criminal Law").

At the end of the school year Duncan was drunk again while attending the school's transfer formal. While at the dance he insulted the Dean which led to an immediate suspension. Chang at that point had been fired due to falsified credentials and enrolled himself at Greendale to earn a legitimate teaching degree. Duncan had mocked him earlier for his situation, but Chang couldn't retaliate physically or he could be kicked out of school. Once Ian was suspended, Chang took advantage of that fact to hit him in the face with a roll of quarters ("Pascal's Triangle Revisited").

Season Two


–Duncan, "The Psychology of Letting Go".
In the study group's second year at a Greendale, Duncan is reinstated and finds himself unexpectedly teaching Anthropology. He is forced to take over the class after the original teacher, Professor June Bauer, is  forced to go on sabbatical after attacking a student. Because he knows nothing about the subject, his teaching style was limited to showing the class various YouTube videos and assigning them dozens of dioramas to create. At Christmas time, Abed has a mental breakdown and Duncan is called in to try and therapize him.  During the semester, he exploits the restraining order he put on Ben Chang, played piano for the Study Group when they briefly replaced the Glee Club (who died in a bus accident), and watched a (European) football game at Jeff's apartment on Valentine's Day. For a brief time he was sober but quickly fell off the wagon by the end of the year.
