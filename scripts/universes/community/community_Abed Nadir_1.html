Abed Nadir is a graduate of Greendale Community College. Abed had a difficult life growing up due in part to his parents. There was cultural discord between them as Abed's father is a Palestinian from Gaza and his mother Polish America. Abed is heavily implied to be on the autism spectrum, and as a result often has a hard time relating to/communicating with others. His mother left his family when he was 6 years old and Abed assumed his father blamed him for it. This created distance between them and resulted in Abed alienating himself further by immersing himself in American pop-culture. His father allowed him to enroll at Greendale Community College only so he could take classes which would help Abed one day take over his dad's falafel restaurant. Eventually Abed convinced his father to let him study Film making instead. During this time he grew close to a study group he joined, particularly Troy Barnes who became his best friend and roommate. After four years at school he graduated with a film degree but was unable to find work as a filmmaker besides doing a commercial for Jeff's short lived law firm. After an unexpected reunion with his study group at Greendale, Abed decided to re-enroll in order to learn how to work better with people. He and his study group also joined a special "Save Greendale Committee" tasked with improving the school. After his sixth year at school he got a job in California working on a television show.

In the Season One episode "The Art of Discourse", Abed and Troy figure out their porn star names by putting the name of their grade school and favorite soda together. Abed's name is "Henry David Thoreau Diet Squirt".
Abed often does movie spoofs, though he prefers the term homage.
Abed has trumped two professors' research thesis: He was the exception to Ian Duncan's Duncan Principle, and he disproved Professor Sheffield's analysis of the TV show "Who's the Boss?". Though in reference to the Duncan Principle, Ian Duncan thinks Abed is the exception, but the Duncan Principle is still in effect - it's just that the scientists fell for it before Abed (the test subject) did.
In the Community College Chronicles, Abed is played by Alan Bruder.
His age has never been directly stated. It is suggested that he is at least 21, since he was seemingly able to enter The Ballroom and buy drinks for himself during Troy's birthday party with no trouble. This would place him somewhere in between Troy and Britta.
In the episode "Applied Anthropology and Culinary Arts", Abed mentions that he delivered a baby in the back of a car. In the episode "The Psychology of Letting Go", several scenes show Abed caring for a pregnant woman, fighting with her boyfriend, and finally delivering it in the back of a car.
Although he is never shown behind the wheel, it has been indicated in the series that Abed drives: Jeff asks Abed to park his car for him in Spanish 101, and in Pillow and Blankets Part 2, the narrator points out that Abed's parking fine goes unpaid.
Prominent TV blogger, Todd VanDerWerff of the The AV Club considers Abed "the most original character of the past decade."

The script for "Mixology Certification" has an unused scene where Abed declares he is 28 years old to Troy in 2010. Had this become canon he would have been born in 1982 and 33 by the end of the series.
Abed is present in every episode of the show, but does not appear onscreen in the penultimate episode "Wedding Videography".
Abed's character is at least partially based on actor and writer Abed Gheith, whom Dan Harmon worked with before Community.
