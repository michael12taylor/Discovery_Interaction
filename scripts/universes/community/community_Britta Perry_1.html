Britta Perry is a graduate of Greendale Community College. She was born in Riverside, Colorado to George and Deb Perry. Britta has two older brothers, one of whom works with children with some type of special disorder in a hospital. On her eleventh birthday, an eager-handed man in a dinosaur costume intruded in on her party at a restaurant; this event has haunted her into adulthood. She became estranged from her parents due to what she felt was bad parenting. Britta entered a rebellious phase and dropped out of high school because she thought it would impress Radiohead. She joined the Peace Corps, did some foot modeling, attended a world-trade rally where she was tear-gassed, and visited Africa. She also joined several activist groups but her memberships didn't last long. A billboard vandalizing team of radicals kicked her out for not being anarchistic enough despite her success at recruiting new members. She was with a feminist group called the "An-Her-Chists" but it disbanded because everyone involved no longer had the passion for their cause. This made Britta realize she needed to move on as well. After attempting to get a job at Yogurtsburgh, she was inspired by a flyer to enrol at Greendale to find some direction. During her time at Greendale, she became close friends with a Spanish study group she joined and even had romantic relationships with two of its members. She completed four years at school and left her friends and the academic world behind finding employment as a bartender. Sometime after graduating, she later unexpectedly reunited with her study group at Greendale. Britta ultimately decided to re-enroll to pursue her original goal of earning a Psychology degree. Along with her old study group buddies, Britta would later join a special organization dedicated to improving the school called the "Save Greendale Committee".
