Jeffrey Tobias "Jeff" Winger (played by Joel McHale) is a graduate of Greendale Community College and currently a Professor of Law at the school. He was born in Denver, Colorado to his parents William Winger and Doreen Winger née Fitzgerald. His father divorced his mother when he was very young and would go on to have another child named Willy Junior. As an adult, Jeff became a very successful defence attorney specializing in DUI/DWAI/DUID cases, traffic offences, and juvenile crimes for over six years. He worked for a law firm called Hamish, Hamish & Hamlin that was founded by Ted. At work, he was often partnered with another lawyer named Mark and the two were known as "Tango & Cash" respectively. A drunk driving case Jeff handled involved a Psychology Professor named Ian Duncan with whom he became good friends. At the height of his success at the firm, Jeff's fraudulent academic credentials were exposed by a colleague of his named Alan Conner. Jeff was disbarred with his license suspended until he earned a legitimate degree. For four years he went to Greendale Community College with this goal in mind. During this time, he became close friends with a study group he formed. After having earned an Associate's degree in Education, he briefly returned to practicing law and started his own law firm. It was unsuccessful and he returned to Greendale where he accepted an offer to teach Law. He was also reunited with his study group and joined a special "Save Greendale Committee" to improve campus life.

Character history
Season One


–Jeff, "Pilot".
After his law firm discovered that Jeff's bachelor's degree was falsified, Jeff was disbarred. He enrolled at Greendale Community College to earn a legitimate degree. He hoped to exploit his friendship with a professor who worked there, Ian Duncan, in order to secure an easy graduation. Another student named Britta Perry caught his eye and he pretended to be the head of a Spanish study group to impress her. Unexpectedly, a real study group is formed with other members of his class thanks to Abed Nadir. Jeff became the reluctant leader of the group and together they dealt with the unusual college life at Greendale. Jeff also had to contend with a few romantic troubles throughout the year. This included dating his Statistics professor Michelle Slater, an unexpected attraction, and his continuing flirtation with Britta. His relationship with Britta reached its climax at the annual Paintball Assassin game when they had sex. This resulted in a love triangle showdown at the Transfer Dance Formal at the end of the school year. Michelle and Britta both publicly declared their love for him and Jeff found himself unable to choose. Jeff left the dance without answering either of them only to complicate matters further. He ran into Annie outside the dance and after commiserating over their respective relationship troubles the two shared a moment and ended up kissing.









Sometime later, Jeff and Shirley unexpectedly bond over their love of gossip and making fun of their fellow students. He is also learned about Britta's new boyfriend, the campus hippie named Vaughn Miller. At Britta's insistence, Jeff put aside his jealousy and tried to be friends with him. When Britta showed Jeff a love poem Vaughn wrote to her, he shared it with Shirley and accidentally the rest of the study group. Vaughn found out and dumped Britta who was angry Jeff betrayed her confidence. Shirley and Jeff decided not to hang out anymore as all their gossiping and mocking wasn't good for either of them. She does tell Jeff he still has a chance with Britta who had a sex dream about him. Later, Jeff apologized to Britta who accepted as she came to understand the tough spot she put him in ("Social Psychology")

A disciplinary tribunal consisting of Dean Pelton, Duncan and Chang was held in Borchert Hall to deal with Britta who admitted to cheating on a Spanish test. Jeff volunteered to represent her but found his efforts hindered when she confessed her guilt. During recess, she accused Jeff of only wanting to help her so she would sleep with him. Jeff admitted it was part of the reason but his main focus was trying to help a friend not get expelled. Britta revealed getting caught was intentional as she was driven by her fears of inadequacy. Jeff used her damaged psyche as her new defence and got her sentenced reduced to one year's worth of mandated therapy sessions from Duncan. Afterwards, Britta begrudgingly thanked Jeff as they watched Pierce perform the new school song on the quad ("Advanced Criminal Law").

When Jeff refused to be a part of Greendale's promotional materials, he got blackmailed by Dean Pelton to recruit Troy for the football team. Annie was upset when he succeeded and Jeff pointed out that she just selfishly wants Troy all for herself. Annie countered that may be true but unlike Jeff, she genuinely cares for Troy. Later, Jeff went to the gym where the football pep rally was being held. Jeff confessed to Troy how he manipulated him into becoming a quarterback again. Troy didn't care as the team was so horrible it allowed him to play for the love of the game free of pressure. Outside the gym, Jeff ran into Annie who showed up to support Troy and apologized for his actions. They were interrupted by Pelton and Pierce who introduced the school's new mascot ("Football, Feminism and You").

Eventually, Jeff moved on from wooing Britta and set his sights on his Statistics professor Michelle Slater. She refused due to the impropriety of dating one of her students. Undeterred, Jeff convinced Chang to get him into a faculty Halloween party Slater was attending. This meant ditching a "Dias De Los Muertos" party Annie was hosting where he was to be the guest of honor. Jeff was rejected again by Slater mostly due to the study group crashing the party. Once he sent his friends away, he took advice from Chang and won Slater over. They were about to leave campus together when Jeff was told by Troy that Pierce needed his help. Jeff reluctantly ended his plans with Slater to see to the emergency. After it was resolved he stayed for Annie's party and danced with her to make up for his absence earlier ("Introduction to Statistics").


Jeff was thrown out of his condo after he failed to make payments on it. He was forced to live out of his Lexus which was discovered by Shirley and Britta. When his car was towed away, he accepted an offer from Abed to move temporarily into his dorm room. Unfortunately, his stay had a negative effect on him as he became too complacent and unfocused. Abed noticed his personality shift and asked Britta to help to get Jeff back to normal. Britta snuck into Jeff's condo and retrieved his expensive Italian faucet heads. She gave it back to Jeff to remind him of who he was and to snap him out of his funk. Jeff was motivated enough to clean up and find a place of his own. He caught up with Abed and Britta at a campus concert and thanked them for their help ("Home Economics").


Jeff was bribed with a faculty parking spot if he agreed to partner with Annie for an intercollegiate debate against City College. His poor performance almost lost them the match but Greendale got a reprieve due to a scheduling conflict. It wasn't until the opposing debater Jeremy Simmons bullied Annie that Jeff took the contest more seriously. He studied with Annie which caused an unexpected sexual tension between them to flare up. At the rescheduled second half of the debate, Team Greendale pulled a commanding lead. A desperate gambit by Jeremy caused Annie to counter with her own unorthodox response. She kissed Jeff to prove her point resulting in the judges declaring Greendale the winner. Afterwards, Jeff awkwardly congratulated Annie who suggested he just pat her before he left ("Debate 109").

He ended the school year participating in a second Paintball Assassin game where his issues with Pierce came to a head. During the contest, Pierce quit the study group just as the paintball contest itself escalated. Greendale's rival school City College interjected themselves into the competition which led to Jeff and Troy gathering the remaining players and forming an alliance against the interlopers. Under their leadership, a two-pronged assault was launched against the paintball invaders. Jeff was eliminated while leading a squad of students to take down the Paintball Gatling gun.

Relationships
In the study group
Jeff was considered the leader by default within the study group. As much as he made a show of lamenting this he inwardly embraced being in charge. Although at times he exploited his position more often than not he did right by the study group. In time he came to care greatly for them and even admitted they changed him for the better. When he became a teacher he became depressed at the thought of everyone leaving him behind while he stayed on as faculty. Eventually, he came to accept that they needed to go out and try to live in the real world away from the craziness of Greendale like he once did.

Trivia
Jeff's age
Jeff's age in the Season Five episode "G.I. Jeff" is revealed to be forty. This information contradicts established canon that his age at the start of the show around 33-34. It is possible he was lying the entire time, however this revelation conflicts with information in previous episodes as well as statements Community creator Dan Harmon himself had made early in the show's production. Below are several "Community" episodes which hint at Jeff's age.

"The Art of Discourse": in 2010 Jeff is called "35" by Mark Cahill and doesn't dispute it.
"Early 21st Century Romanticism": In 2011, Ben Chang steals Jeff's driver's license which clearly says "November 21, 1971" (this is actor Joel McHale's birthdate). On DVD commentaries for this episode and also in a tweet to a fan, Harmon dismissed this as a production error and suggested that Jeff was several years younger than him or Joel. At the time McHale was 40 and Harmon was 38.
"Intro to Political Science": In 2011, a videotape of Jeff's audition for "The Real World: Seattle" is shown. Jeff says he was "like 19" when he recorded that tape. The Real World: Seattle premiered on June 16, 1998, and if it followed the production schedule of other Real World shows, then it accepted audition tapes the previous year in 1997. This then suggests that Jeff was born around 1978. That puts Jeff's age at that time around 33-34. It should then make him 36-37 in Season Five.
"Foosball and Nocturnal Vigilantism": In 2012 Jeff claimed he was 10 years old when he met Shirley "Big Cheddar," who was 12 at the time. If Jeff was lying then he was 14-15 and looked small for his age in the flashback shown. This also means Shirley's age gets increased to 42. Incidentally, the child actor hired to play young Jeff (Jacob Bertrand) was 11 years old at the time.
"Cooperative Escapism in Familial Relations": in 2012, Jeff very specifically tells his father he faked an appendectomy in seventh grade "22 years ago." The average age of a seventh grader is between 11-13, older if Jeff had failed a grade and was held back or younger if he skipped a grade (unlikely as it would probably be something he'd brag about). This is consistent with previous episodes as it places his age at that time to be around 34-35 which would make him 36-37 in Season Five. Additionally, it's unlikely Jeff could get away with lying about his age to his own father.
After "G.I. Jeff" originally aired Community writer and executive producer Andy Bobrow had a discussion with several fans on his Twitter account about this discontinuity and responded with this tweet: 

“@Funkapus @SaraLinnLinn We try not to be sloppy. Try to make the characters as real as possible. Sometimes we screw up and everyone tells us.”

Other notes
