Actor
Saruman (Quenya; IPA: ['saruman]), also known as Saruman the White was the first of the order of Istar (wizard), who came to Middle-earth as Emissaries of the Valar in the Third Age. He also was the leader of the wizards and of the White Council that opposed Sauron. His extensive studies of dark magic, however, eventually led him to desire the One Ring. Thinking he could gain it for himself or become Sauron's servant alone, Saruman allied Isengard with Mordor in the War of the Ring, in which he was defeated.

He studied deeply the arts of Sauron, the better to initially oppose him, but he soon became enamored of the Dark Lord's devices, especially the One Ring. He betrayed his mission and came to view the future of Middle-earth under his or Sauron's dominion. While coveting the Ring, Saruman kept the pretense of allegiance to the Enemy. But his plans came to naught, and his power was broken in the Battle of the Hornburg and the Battle of Isengard.

Before his fall, he was the chief of both the wizards and of the White Council (a league of all those opposed to Sauron). His knowledge and skill, especially of Sauron's devices, was said to be great. However, his deep study of the Rings of Power and Sauron's other magic corrupted him, and his overweening lust for power led to his downfall. Though not truly faithful to his master, Saruman unintentionally fell deeper under Sauron's sway by delving into Ring-lore and betraying the Valar. He is one of the few characters in Middle-earth who is morally "grey" - being neither a genuine servant of evil nor an agent of good. He ultimately trusts only his own counsel and schemes for his own ends.

History
Third Age
Saruman as the Maia Curumo before leaving Valinor
Saruman was originally one of the powerful Maiar of Aulë the Smith named Curumo (later in Sindarin, Curunír). In Valinor, the land of the Valar, a council was called by Manwë, leader of the Valar, shortly after Sauron's defeat by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. Though Sauron was overthrown, it would later turn out that he had not been effectively vanquished and his shadow began to fall upon Middle-earth a second time. It was decided to send five emissaries to Middle-earth. These should be "mighty, peers of Sauron, yet forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh," as they were intended to help Men and Elves unite against Sauron, but the wizards were forbidden from matching the Dark Lord in power and fear.

Curumo was one of those who volunteered, whereas the last one, Olórin, (later known as "Gandalf") was commanded by Manwë to go too. It was from this point that Curumo began to be jealous of Olórin, due to Varda's decision to send Olórin not as the third Istari, but as the second. He also was charged to take Aiwendil (later called "Radagast") to please Yavanna, which Curumo did not wish to do, and this led to contempt for the latter Wizard. The others who were chosen were Alatar and Pallando (the Blue Wizards). Curumo then was appointed overall leader of the group.

Arrival in Middle-earth
The arrival of the Istari in Middle-earth
The five wizards arrived seaprately at the Grey Havens in the west of Eriador around the year TA 1000. Only the keeper of the havens, Círdan the Shipwright, knew Saruman's identity and origin. Saruman would later discover that Círdan had given Narya, the Red Ring, to Gandalf upon their first landing in Middle-earth. Even though Saruman was immediately considered the head of the order while Gandalf was not, Círdan had divined Gandalf as the wisest and greatest of the wizards. Saruman's jealousy of Gandalf grew from these events, perhaps because he feared that he would eventually supplant him as chief of wizards.

Saruman and the two Blue Wizards went into the east of Middle-earth. After one and a half millennia, he returned to the west, just as Sauron's power was growing again in Dol Guldur.

The White Council
When the White Council was formed at approximately year 2463 of the Third Age in order to counter Sauron, Saruman was appointed its leader, though Galadriel wanted Gandalf in this position. Saruman refused to step down due to his pride, while Gandalf had declined. At this point Saruman had begun to sense the resurgence of Sauron and to envy and desire his power, and especially the One Ring. This was also the same year that the One Ring was taken by the Halfling Sméagol (later called Gollum), who disappeared with it into the Misty Mountains for hundreds of years. It was during the meetings of the Council that Saruman first noted Gandalf's interest in Hobbits and The Shire, and believing that all his deeds related to some as yet undisclosed plan of his for self-enhancement, Saruman himself began keeping a greater watch on Gandalf and sent spies to The Shire. At first, he himself visited it secretly but stopped when he realized that its inhabitants had noticed him. Amongst the purposes of his visits was to procure some of the halflings' Pipe-weed, since in secret imitation of Gandalf (and for which he publicly disdained him) he had begun to smoke.

At Isengard
A new power is rising. Against it the old allies and policies will not avail us at all. There is no hope left in Elves or dying Numenor. This then is one choice before you, before us. We may join with that Power. It would be wise, Gandalf. There is hope that way. Its victory is at hand; and there will be rich reward for those that aided it.—Saruman, speaking to Gandalf - The Fellowship of the Ring, "The Council of Elrond"
Saruman the White, by 1oshuart
In the year TA 2759, Saruman settled in Isengard with the permission of the Steward of Gondor, Beren, although he settled only as Warden of the Tower and representative of the Steward (the stronghold had by then been abandoned by Gondor). There he became important in the informal alliance defending the west of Middle-earth. In the tower of Isengard, Orthanc, he also found one of the remaining Palantíri.

In TA 2850, Gandalf entered Dol Guldur and confirmed that the evil presence was indeed Sauron. On Saruman's advice, the White Council decided against attacking Dol Guldur. Gandalf would later remark that it was at this council meeting that he first began to suspect that Saruman desired to possess the One Ring. Saruman's real intention was to permit Sauron to build up his strength, so that the One Ring would reveal itself. He later found that Sauron had more knowledge of the possible location of the One Ring than he expected, and in TA 2941, Saruman finally agreed to attack Dol Guldur. The attack was successful, and by the devices of Saruman, Sauron was driven from the fortress.

Ten years after Sauron abandoned Dol Guldur, he returned to Mordor and declared himself openly. He established contact with Saruman through the palantír captured from Minas Ithil, which had since become known as Minas Morgul. The White Wizard lost the contest of wills with the Dark Lord and was enticed, becoming a servant of Sauron. He no longer opposed him, but desired his victory (though he retained his desire for the Ruling Ring). Taking Isengard for his own in TA 2953, Saruman began to trouble the borders of Rohan with Orc and Dunlending raids, whilst keeping hidden any evidence of his treachery. In preparation for the war, Saruman amassed a mighty army of Orcs, Uruk-hai, Half-orcs, wicked Men and Wolves within Isengard and kept up the façade of his allegiance to Sauron while searching for the Ring. Little did he know that his master was already aware of his plans, despite having failed to dominate him fully.  

When Gandalf presented Saruman with the discovery and the location of the One Ring, Saruman revealed his desire for it and that he was in thrall to Sauron. He had also shed the title of Saruman the White; Saruman no longer had any loyalty to the White Council, or the Ring-bearer. He tried unsuccessfully to gain Gandalf's aid. When Gandalf refused to join with either him or Sauron, Saruman held him captive in Isengard. Gandalf later escaped with help from Gwaihir the Windlord, one of Middle-earth's Great Eagles, and made Saruman's treachery known to the rest of the White Council.

The Beginning of the End
Saruman making a bomb in his tower, Orthanc
By one account, the Nazgûl came two days after Gandalf's escape and Saruman used his Voice to persuade the Lord of the Nazgûl that he did not know the Ring's location but that Gandalf did and they should seek him nearby. After the Nazgûl heard this they went back on the main road rode along and instead found Gríma Wormtongue (who was on his way to tell Saruman that Gandalf had been to Edoras) who revealed that Saruman was hiding his knowledge of the Shire from them, proving that the wizard's allegiance to Sauron was a sham. 

By another account, Saruman only discovered that Gandalf had escaped when the Nazgûl arrived. He had been, according to this account, about to beg Gandalf for forgiveness and help, only to find him gone. To evade the danger at hand and enticed by the thought of being Sauron's servant alone or gaining the Ring, he pretended that Gandalf was still there and that the latter had just been forced to tell the location of the Shire. The Nazgûl later learned that Saruman knew far more than he had revealed. On their way to the Shire, the Nazgûl met one of the wizard's informants in Eriador, from whom they got detailed maps of the Shire made by Saruman. They sent the spy back to the Shire after warning him that he was now in the service of Mordor (the Dunlending in the Inn of the Prancing Pony). 

Believing that he would find no pity from either quarter (a false assumption, since he was later offered pardon by Gandalf) and that he had lost chance of rising in Sauron's favour; Saruman now put all efforts into obtaining the One Ring for himself. Not all of these efforts ever became known, but they included sending spies to waylay Frodo Baggins on his flight from the Shire (Bill Ferny in Bree), attacking Rohan outright with Orcs and dispatching raiding parties of Uruk-hai accompanied by Orcs from the Misty Mountains on likely routes the Fellowship of the Ring might take through Rohan to go towards Gondor. One of those companies captured Pippin and Merry and shot Boromir "with many black-feathered arrows" when he tried to defend the Hobbits. This led Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli on a search which eventually led to the Battle of the Hornburg as well as the Destruction of Isengard by the Ents under Treebeard, leading to Sauron losing one of his most potent servants and the end of Saruman's reign of terror in the west.

Power destroyed
You have become a fool, Saruman, and yet pitiable. You might still have turned away from folly and evil, and have been of service. But you choose to stay and gnaw the ends of your old plots. Stay then! But I warn you, you will not easily come out again. Not unless the dark hands of the east stretch out to take you!—Gandalf the White
Saruman looks down upon Gandalf from the Pinnacle of Orthanc
Following the Ents' destruction of Isengard, Saruman found himself confined to Orthanc and his servants scattered or killed. After the arrival of Théoden, Gandalf, Aragorn, and the remaining members of the Fellowship, Saruman made one final unsuccessful attempt to turn Théoden and Gandalf over to evil. The latter then offered Saruman a chance for redemption, which involved surrendering his staff and the Keys of Orthanc as a pledge. Saruman had a moment of doubt but in the end pride, anger, envy, fear and hate won over and he refused the chance of redemption.

Saruman's staff broken by Gandalf
Gandalf, who had returned from death to supplant Saruman, as the White and the head of the Istari, expelled Saruman from the order and broke his staff. Saruman also lost the Palantír of Orthanc when Gríma Wormtongue threw it off a balcony of Orthanc, undecided about which he hated more, Saruman or Gandalf, and hitting neither.

Final fall
Left out of the final stages of the War of the Ring, Saruman eventually managed to persuade the Ents who kept him captive into letting him leave Isengard after he met the conditions of handing over the Keys of Orthanc. He then went to the Shire, which his ally Lotho Sackville-Baggins had brought under control. He spent his final days as a small-time criminal master in Hobbiton known as Sharkey (from the Orkish sharkû, meaning "old man"), until he was overthrown in the Battle of Bywater. In the aftermath of that battle Frodo confronted Saruman and exiled him from the Shire, but before he could leave, Gríma Wormtongue killed Saruman by slitting his throat with a dagger, on the very doorstep of Bag End.

Legacy
After his departure from Orthanc, King Elessar entered the tower with the intent of re-ordering it. Inside, Elessar's men found many treasures that Saruman had conned off of King Théoden. There was a secret closet that could only be found with the aid of Gimli; it contained the original Elendilmir, which had presumed to be lost forever when Isildur perished in the Gladden Fields, as well as a golden chain which was presumed to have once borne the One Ring.

Fate
Saruman, being a Maia, did not truly die. His spirit separated from his body much like his master Sauron's after the Downfall of Númenor. As an incorporeal spirit, he should have been called to the Halls of Mandos, but the tale implies that he was barred from returning. Tolkien indicated that his spirit was left naked, powerless and wandering, never to return to Middle-earth:

Whereas Curunir was cast down, and utterly humbled, and perished at last by the hand of an oppressed slave; and his spirit went whither-soever it was doomed to go, and to Middle-earth, whether naked or embodied, came never back.—Saruman's fate
Names
Curumo, the Quenya name for Saruman. Its Tengwar spelling is aU7Ut^, and its IPA pronunciation is [ˈkurumo]. Curumo means "Skilled Man" or "Cunning One".
Curunír, the Sindarin name for Saruman. It roughly translates "man of skill." Curunir was the original name given to Saruman as the leader of the Wizards. Around the time of the War of the Ring, this name was less known and rarely used save among the Elves, and even rarely used by them except for their leaders.
Saruman, as called by Gandalf, Men in Rohan, and Men in most other places.
Sharku, the name given to him by his Uruk-Hai, meaning in Black Speech "Old Man."
Sharkey, a form of the word is later used by the Ruffians at the Shire, from "Sharku."
Powers and abilities
Saruman's status as chief of the Wizards and head of the White Council (before Gandalf) gave him arsenal to a variety of powers. Though he would eventually be defeated by Gandalf the White, Saruman's powers and abilities were very mighty indeed at the peak of his power, and he managed to imprison Gandalf the Grey. Gandalf described Saruman as an individual of great knowledge, cunning, and skill. He was capably of breeding his own Uruk-hai, and had many spies, be they walking on two legs or birds, that escaped detection. He was extremely learned in Ringlore and mechanics, and his knowledge enabled him to create great forges and explosives that could breach the walls of Helm's Deep and burn an Ent to death. Unfortunately, it was Saruman's extensive knowledge of the Rings of Power that was one of the reason leading to his downfall, as he became enamored of the power of the rings, and particularly the One Ring.

He was well-versed in magic, one spell he displayed giving speed and strength to the Orcs who had kidnapped Merry and Pippin while obstructing Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. By far Saruman's greatest power (and the only one he was able to retain after the downfall of Isengard), however, is speech. He seems to have the ability to bend any but the absolute strongest minds to his will, simply by speaking to them. Even with Isengard broken and Saruman's treachery revealed, Gandalf had to be very careful, Saruman could ensnare almost anyone with the power of his voice, few can contend with his will. Gandalf was not drawn into this power when he confronted Saruman; in trying to enchant some in the company, he left others out of his designs, and thus could not ensnare everyone at once. However, even in this situation, it is said that only Gandalf himself remained totally unmoved. Aragorn stated during this time that few other than Gandalf, Elrond and Galadriel could resist his voice, even at this point. Saruman later used his persuasive power to escape Orthanc, convincing Treebeard to let him go.

Saruman falling to his death from Orthanc
In Peter Jackson's first film trilogy, Saruman is played by Sir Christopher Lee and is the secondary antagonist of The Fellowship of the Ring and primary antagonist of The Two Towers. Unlike in the novels, his allegiance to Sauron is genuine and he is portrayed plainly as a servant carrying out Sauron's will. He is referred to only as "the White," omitting his title of "Saruman of Many Colours." Lee is the only cast member to ever have met Tolkien.

By the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring, Saruman reveals that he has been utterly enslaved by the will of Sauron and by his own thirst for power. When Gandalf refuses to join Mordor, he imprisons him in Orthanc. Instructed by his master to build him "an army worthy of Mordor", Saruman gathers his Orcs and begins the preparations for war: constructing dams and wooden machinery, fortifying the ringed walls of Isengard, forging arms and breeding Uruk-hai. He confronts Gandalf once more atop Orthanc, trying to coerce him into submitting to Sauron, only for the Grey Pilgrim to flee. Saruman tracks the Fellowship using Crebain and summons massive snow avalanches and rock-slides to try and hinder the heroes at Caradhras. Uruk-hai in service to Saruman attack the Fellowship at the conclusion of the film, killing Boromir and capturing Merry and Pippin. Saruman's interactions with Gandalf also were toned down in the movie compared to in the books, where he was shown to interact with Gandalf in a genuinely friendly manner, as well as appearing to accept that Gandalf chose death over serving Sauron with some sadness, whereas even before his allegiance to Sauron was revealed, he barely hid his contempt for Gandalf with sarcastic barbs.

In The Two Towers, Saruman leads his master's conquest in the West of Middle-earth. He allies himself with the Dunlendings who join his Orc parties and burn the Westfold, then amasses an Uruk-hai army of 10,000 to destroy Rohan. He is aided by Gríma Wormtongue and is depicted as having outright possessed Théoden. At the climax of the film, Saruman's army is defeated at Helm's Deep and Isengard is overrun by Ents.

Saruman does not appear in the theatrical cut of The Return of the King; Treebeard only suggests that the fallen wizard's power is no more. In the extended edition, Gandalf, Aragorn, Théoden, Gimli, Merry and Pippin confront Saruman in Isengard at the beginning of the film. Gandalf wishes to interrogate Saruman, but Gríma stabs Saruman at the pinnacle of Orthanc. As Saruman falls to his death, he drops the Palantir.

The Scouring of the Shire, which is where Saruman meets his end in the novels, is entirely omitted from the film adaptations, although certain actions such as Saruman being killed by Grima before the latter was felled by an arrow did reference the event indirectly. Jackson considered the Scouring anticlimactic.

ToyBiz version of Saruman
Peter Jackson's trilogy explicitly shows Saruman influencing the weather to create the snowstorm on Caradhras that defeated the Fellowship's efforts to cross the mountains there, although the book didn't even suggest that. Though Boromir thought the storm and falling boulders might be caused by some evil, saying "there are fell voices on the air; and these stones are aimed at us," Aragorn and Gandalf believed it was just the forces of nature that might be expected on "Caradhras the Cruel." On a similar note, he also was shown in the films to display telepathy, as he taunted Gandalf about going through the mines and implying that Gandalf was already aware that the Dwarves had awoken a Balgrog; and in the film version of The Two Towers, Saruman uses telepathy to directly possess King Theoden, as Gandalf tries and succeeds in exorcising his influence.

In the films, Saruman's staff of power is a resemblance to his own tower, Orthanc, with a white crystal set between the spires. As a talisman of his authority, it is also used as a walking stick. He uses it to duel Gandalf the Grey. Gandalf the White destroys Saruman's staff effortlessly in The Return of the King extended edition shortly after Saruman's failed attempt at scorching Gandalf.

The Hobbit film trilogy
"Who is that odd little fellow?" - Sir Christopher Lee during the shooting of The Hobbit
Sir Christopher Lee reprised the role in Peter Jackson's live action The Hobbit trilogy. He originally expressed interest in voicing Smaug the dragon, but the role ended up going to Benedict Cumberbatch. Christopher Lee also managed to humour Peter Jackson by asking him "Am I still in the movie?" This refers to when Christopher Lee's (Saruman's) death scene was cut from the theatrical version of The Return of the King and he had a falling out with Peter Jackson all those years ago.

Saruman first appears in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. He arrives in Rivendell for a meeting of the White Council. Saruman expresses his disapproval of Gandalf's actions concerning the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain and dismisses Gandalf's reasons as 'looking for trouble where none exists'. He is skeptical of the information Gandalf provides on the Necromancer and he further dismisses the information when he learns it came from Radagast the Brown, who he believes is a fool and an embarrassment to the Istari due to his consumption of mushrooms. When presented with the Morgul blade, Saruman states there is no proof that it belonged to the Witch-king of Angmar. Saruman sums up all of Gandalf's concerns as nothing to worry about but states that he feels he cannot condone the quest of the Dwarves to reclaim Erebor. However, unbeknownst to Saruman, the Dwarves have already left Rivendell.

In The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, Saruman arrives at Dol Guldur along with Elrond, after being summoned there by Galadriel, to rescue Gandalf. Saruman appears as Galadriel and Gandalf are surrounded by the Nazgûl and asks if she needs assistance. At this, two of the Nazgûl turn towards him and both he and Elrond begin to battle with the Nine. Saruman duels several of the Ringwraiths, appearing to be able to handle up to two at a time. In the end, both he and Elrond overpower the Nine and they retreat momentarily. After Gandalf is taken away by Radagast, Sauron appears before the remainder of the White Council along with the returning Nazgûl. Saruman readies himself for further battle but appears to be paralyzed with awe of Sauron's power. Galadriel rises in a terrifying ethereal form and begins a battle of wills with Sauron. Saruman barely seems to notice this, still stunned in amazement of Sauron. Galadriel eventually gains the upper hand and banishes Sauron from Dol Guldur. After recovering from his shock, Saruman notes that while Galadriel has banished Sauron, it took nearly all of her power to do it and tells Elrond to take her back to Lothlórien, When Elrond argues that Sauron must be found and permanently destroyed, Saruman replies that without the One Ring, Sauron will never regain his full strength. He then tells them to go and 'leave Sauron to me.' This is most likely the point, where Saruman begins his fall into evil. Although he spoke of Sauron not regaining his full power, Saruman was clearly dumbfounded after witnessing his power first hand, foreshadowing his eventual loss of any hope of defeating him and his eventual service to Sauron. On a similar note, the movie depicts Saruman's allegiance to Gandalf and the others as genuine during the battle of Dol Guldur, while in the original Hobbit book, it is implied that he was already serving Sauron by that time and had deliberately ensured the Dark Lord's escape during the battle.

There is also a song called "The Voice of Saruman" created by the heavy metal band called "Lorien."

Ralph Bakshi version
Saruman of Many Colours in Ralph Bakshi's version of The Lord of the Rings.
In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film of The Lord of the Rings, Fraser Kerr provided the voice of Saruman. At one point in that film's development, film executives thought that the names "Saruman" and "Sauron" were too similar, and would confuse the audience, and decided that Saruman should be renamed "Aruman". This decision was eventually reversed, but some references to "Aruman" remained in the finished film. The dialogue of Bakshi's film retained Saruman's adoption of the title "Saruman of Many Colours", and the character was dressed in red. In Ralph Bakshi's animated film, Saruman sends a swirling stream of magical fire from Isengard to Helm's Deep to blow apart the ramparts and walls of Helms Deep.

Radio version
Peter Howell played Saruman in BBC Radio's 1981 serialisation of The Lord of the Rings.

The Battle for Middle Earth
Saruman in the BFME game-series
The evil campaign of BFME begins with Isengard's betrayal and early service to Sauron, and then continues with Saruman's conquest of Rohan signified by the fall of Helm's Deep and the deaths of Théoden and Éomer. In BFME II and its expansion ROTWK, Saruman does not take part in the campaign since BFME II shows the War in the North. While ROTWK is before Saruman's arrival in Middle Earth, in all games however, he does appear as the main hero for Isengard in skirmish battles. Saruman starts off with the standard wizard blast power which can destroy an entire battalion of infantry (Without armor upgrades)

His second ability was a fireball, very useful for blasting away heroes and flyers. His third power was called "Wormtounge" this ability allows Saruman to gain control of units with the power of his voice (Note: This power was temporary the units will return to their original faction after a minute or so. However if the player commands the controlled unit to attack and destroy an enemy building the unit remains in Saruman's possession)

His next power was Speechcraft. This allows friendly units to gain a major boost in experience. His final power was Lightning Blast, in which Saruman casts down a mighty lightning strike that can decimate infantry (With armor upgrades).

The Lord of the Rings: Conquest
In one of the early missions of the game, Isengard is attacked by the Ents and the Rohirrim soldiers. Once Isengard is captured, the Rohirrim and Ents are free to help reclaim Isengard for the forces of light and overthrow Saruman and his evil forces. Later in the mission, the player gets to take control of Gandalf, and is lead up through the stairs inside the tower of Orthanc to confront Saruman in a duel and the player must kill Saruman in order to be successful in the Good Campaign, the setting is the same as seen in "The Fellowship of the Ring", however this time Gandalf is on an equal level of power if not stronger than Saruman. Once the player succeeds in killing Saruman, then the player can move on.

Saruman charging towards the White Tree of Gondor to destroy it.
However in the evil campaign, Sauron regains the One Ring. His power stretches enough that he recalls his most potent servants (including Saruman and the Witch-king) and his allies. Later Saruman is sent with a large army to retake the frail city of Minas Tirith, Saruman is at the front line of the evil force breaking through the ranks of Gondor's soldiers as he reaches out to complete his objective of destroying (burning) the white tree and does so (fulfilling the vision Pippin had seen).

Later we see Saruman at Weathertop, where Aragorn with the aid of Gondor, the Ents and the eagles making a last stand against the forces of evil, standing in the way of Rivendell and The Shire. Saruman is sent to Kill Aragorn, who stands at the peak of Weathertop waiting. Saruman succeeds in killing Aragorn and the force moves out to destroy Rivendell.

In the game, Saruman's staff is the same as that of the Mouth of Sauron. Saruman's specialty in the game is the area attack, where he will strike the staff against the floor and punch the ground sending out two shock waves, much more powerful and causing more damage than the standard mage. His melee attack is also quick and swift, and his magic and glow of the staff is purple.

The Lord of the Rings Online
