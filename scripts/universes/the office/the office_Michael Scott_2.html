<html><p>The show often uses the joke "that's what she said", which was popularized by the Wayne's World sketch on Saturday Night Live. In the original BBC version of The Office, Ricky Gervais's character David Brent frequently used the similar phrase "as the actress said to the bishop" as an inappropriate joke. Michael inserts the phrase as a sexually suggestive double entendre even in the most inappropriate circumstances, including business meetings and legal depositions. Michael finds uttering the phrase so irresistible that in "Sexual Harassment" he is goaded into saying it just seconds after Jan Levinson and a lawyer from Corporate specifically ask him not to do so. The phrase has become so associated with the character that the television show 30 Rock in the episode "TGS Hates Women", there was a scene in which Liz Lemon became infuriated at another character's use of "TWSS" because "Steve Carell owns 'That's What She Said,' okay? He owns it!" In the episode "Goodbye, Michael", "that's what she said" was Steve Carell's final (inaudible) line as a series regular, and was his first line upon returning as a guest star in "Finale".

Comparison with David Brent
Although originally based on David Brent, Scott developed into a significantly different character than his British counterpart. Whereas Brent is shown to be irredeemably incompetent, Scott is portrayed as an outstanding salesman who is unwisely promoted to a management role to which he appears completely ill-suited. (In a scathing performance review during episode eight of season two, Jan Levinson suggests that Scott should be removed from his management role and return to sales). Scott is thus an apt example of the Peter principle which states that competent persons in a hierarchical organization will "rise to the level of their incompetence" after which they will not advance.

Despite his failings, Scott has been oddly successful as regional manager. This is attributed, in part, to his weakness of procrastination wherein he typically forfeits a bad choice by seeking the advice of his more competent subordinates (such as Jim, Oscar, or Darryl) and uses their recommendations. Scott's success is also partly attributed to his main strength: genuinely caring about the well-being of the office and treating his employees like family. When he took over the Scranton Branch he decreased costs by 17%, without firing any personnel. After the merger of the two branches, Scott does not lose a single client despite a great deal of employee turnover (much of which he was directly responsible for). He received a $3,000 bonus for firing Devon, most likely because his doing so saved the company around $50,000. Although it is suggested that Brent has had similar success, such claims only ever come from Brent himself, thus making them unreliable.

Scott's social immaturity and inability to cope with responsibility are balanced with a personality that is much more caring than Brent's, even if both make unwise comments in the heat of the moment. Unlike Brent, who pretends to be friendly with many of his employees purely for the benefit of the cameras, Scott seems to genuinely like his colleagues, with the exception of Human Resources Director Toby Flenderson. Scott's need to be liked by his staff and his belief that people see him as a genuine friend leads him to become very hurt when he realizes this is not the case. Most, if not all, of Scott's managerial blunders, can be directly correlated with the degree to which he desires to be liked by his employees or jealously seeks their approval.

The DVD commentary to the pilot episode suggests that Scott's character continues a process begun in the second UK series, in which Gervais and Merchant intentionally made Brent less nasty, and more of a buffoon. It is said in the commentary that Gervais and Merchant suggested that this be applied to Scott. This also reflects a general change in the US version's attitude, which is more sympathetic to the characters, and tones down the cruel humor of the original. The commentary also says that Steve Carell had not seen more than a few minutes of the original UK series when he was offered the role of Scott and has since made a conscious decision not to watch it in case it influences his own performance. During an interview on Marc Maron's podcast, Jenna Fischer said that, when initially developing the show, Gervais explained that it is much more common in the UK for people to spend many years working at jobs that they dislike or are unfit for than it is in the US, which is why Michael Scott is portrayed as being significantly more successful in the workplace than was Brent.

The show's writers have said that the 2005 hit movie The 40-Year-Old Virgin provided very useful guidance as they refined the character along with Steve Carell between the first and second seasons. Michael Scott wore a large amount of hair gel and dressed sloppily in Season 1, but by Season 2 he had a more conventional haircut and dressed much more neatly. Also, while Michael is often rude and nasty in Season 1, he is generally nicer and less hard-edged in subsequent seasons.

In the seventh-season episode "The Seminar", Michael in fact briefly meets David Brent in the lobby and they establish an immediate rapport, joking together and generally signalling that they would have been good friends.

Behind the scenes
U.S. Developer Greg Daniels envisioned Michael Scott behaving as if "I was hoping that the documentary about this would one day be seen by Jennifer Aniston, and I was just trying to impress her any way I possibly could." On the audio commentary for "Valentine's Day", Daniels notes that he included a meeting between Michael and two other branch managers in order to contrast Michael's level of competence with theirs: while Michael is not as dynamic as Josh Porter who would later be hired in a senior management position at Staples, his management skills are superior to those of the hopelessly inept Craig and could be regarded as an adequate but unexceptional branch manager who is, despite his antics, just competent enough to avoid being fired.
Writer B. J. Novak explains that Michael Scott drives a Sebring because it is the most ostentatious car he can afford, opting for a convertible despite the fact that the climate in Scranton is cool even in the summer.
After the airing of "Garage Sale," Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper issued a press release appointing Michael Scott to the position of Director of Paper Distribution in the Department of Natural Resources.
Until "The Inner Circle," the character Michael Scott had appeared in every episode.
Trivia
In the episode "Survivor Man" Michael mentions suffering from hemorrhoids

 The date is unknown because of these inconsistencies: In Michael's Last Dundies, it is revealed that Michael worked at Dunder Mifflin for 9,986,000 minutes, putting his start date at April 6, 1992. However, in The Negotiation, released on April 5, 2007, it is revealed that he worked at Dunder Mifflin for fourteen years, putting his start date in 1993. This is also backed in the  pilot, released in 2005, when Michael reveals that he has worked at Dunder Mifflin for twelve years, also putting his start date in 1993.
