Andrew Baines "Andy" Bernard (born Walter Baines Bernard Jr.; born January 24, 1973) is a fictional character from the NBC comedy television series The Office, portrayed by Ed Helms. He has no counterpart in the original British version of the series. He is introduced as the Regional Director in Charge of Sales at the Stamford branch of paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin in the third-season premiere when Jim Halpert transfers, ultimately merging with the Scranton branch in the episode "The Merger" later in the season. He becomes Regional Manager at the Scranton branch courtesy of Robert California in the eighth-season premiere following the departure of Michael Scott and Deangelo Vickers, although temporarily is fired and replaced by Nellie Bertram before his reinstatement by new CEO David Wallace. Although throughout the ninth season, Andy's relationship with Wallace deteriorates from Andy's lack of focus and professionalism, eventually culminating in Andy's voluntary resignation, to his reinstatement as a salesman to his eventual firing again, after Andy's vulgar actions cause David Wallace to fire him, which he uses to his advantage in order to pursue a singing career. This all happens over the course of one day in "Livin' the Dream".

Portrayed by


His character is insecure, seemingly due to a strained parental relationship, yet demonstrates self-centered and arrogant attitudes. Despite this, he has been shown to act very kindly to his co-workers on occasion, at times even acting as a brother. In Season 6 Episode 17, Andy reveals that his parents originally named him Walter Jr., but after his baby brother was born when he was 6, his parents felt that the brother better represented the Walter Jr. name. His parents then changed his name to Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book. He often references his education at Cornell University, where he was a part of an a cappella group, which contributed to his love for theatrical singing. Andy demonstrates a sycophantic attitude toward his superiors as well as severe anger management issues. He becomes involved in a long-term but failed relationship with accountant Angela Martin, but later finds a deeper connection with receptionist Erin Hannon. However, the relationship starts to sour throughout the ninth season and finally ends in "Couples Discount" when Erin gets fed up with Andy's neglect and selfishness.

Although Helms received praise for his performance, the character received a mixed reception. Andy was named one of the most annoying TV characters of 2011 by Vulture; in contrast, Nerve ranked him the second funniest character on the series, behind only Michael Scott.

The character is named after American economist Andrew Bernard, professor of international economics at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.

Biography
Andy claims to have been born and raised in Simsbury, Connecticut. His birth name was Walter Bernard Jr., but after his younger brother was born, his parents decided that the new baby better embodied that name and should be named after his father instead. Thus, the original Walter was renamed Andrew, a name taken from a book of baby names. He claims to have been an obese child, though he never talks about it. It can be assumed that Andy's family was considerably wealthy growing up, as he admits that whenever anybody wanted something they would write it on a list for the housekeeper to get.

Andy is a 1995 alumnus of Cornell University, which he will often brag about to his peers, and minored in History. In a talking-head interview, he brags that he graduated in four years, having never studied once, been drunk the whole time, and sung in the a cappella group "Here Comes Treble", which he mentions often. Andy is descended from a well-heeled line of WASPs, that he claims "goes all the way back to Moses", and his family purportedly gained their wealth by transporting slaves. Andy often refers to himself by his nickname, "the 'Nard Dog". Within "Here Comes Treble", his nickname is "Boner Champ," which he earned after engaging in coitus with a snowman to completion. He enjoys singing in a high falsetto voice, occasionally to the accompaniment of his banjo. He has experimented with the sitar, eventually learning to play "Deck the Halls". He also plays piano and guitar.

Andy has worked at Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, AIG, and Enron. It is also revealed that Andy suffers from irritable bowel syndrome.

Andy was the Regional Director in Charge of Sales at the Dunder Mifflin Stamford branch. Andy worked with fellow salesmen Jim and Karen, under the direction of Josh Porter. Upon the branch's closure, Andy transferred to the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch. Despite this, he repeatedly proves himself to be a poor salesman, being one of the two worst salesmen in the office along with Pam Halpert. After she becomes an office administrator, he is left the worst salesman, outsold even by the warehouse workers.

Andy is shown to enjoy inventing nicknames for his colleagues. He nicknamed Jim Halpert "Big Tuna", because he ate a tuna sandwich on his first day at the Stamford branch, and once called Ryan Howard "Big Turkey," presumably for a similar reason.

Prior to his anger management training, Andy had severe anger problems. Upon finding his calculator embedded in Jell-O, a trademark prank of Jim's, he screams and kicks a trash can across the office. After punching a hole in the wall of the office, in frustration over his hidden cell phone, Andy is sent to anger management training, which he claims is still "Management Training."

Andy regularly dresses in a distinctive, over-the-top Ivy League style, usually consisting of bright colored pants (some embroidered with animals and tennis rackets), D-ring belts, tattersall shirts, sweater vests, striped ties, a tie clip, or sometimes even a bow tie. In various episodes, Andy wears clothes of the style found at the stores Brooks Brothers, Vineyard Vines, and J. Crew. In various episodes, Andy is seen wearing a blue, thick woven bracelet on his right wrist, despite that it will, at times, clash with his overall appearance.

During the summer of 2011, Andy is promoted to Regional Manager of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch. However, when he returns to Scranton after a trip to Florida and discovers that Nellie Bertram has replaced him, he goes into a fit of rage. After the incident, he refuses to be demoted, which ultimately leads to Robert California firing him. However, after persuading David Wallace to re-purchase the company, Andy is reinstated as a manager. Andy later tells David Wallace that he is going to quit his job, and after having second thoughts almost immediately, gets temporarily rehired as a salesman. Then, he quits again to pursue his dream of being an entertainer.

After embarrassing himself at a singing competition show audition (which becomes an internet meme) Andy is offered a job in the admissions office at Cornell University and decides to return to his alma mater. In the series finale table read, Andy announces he has a fiancée and invites everyone in the office to his wedding. However, this was not included in the actual episode.

Fashion
Andy's fashion sense is generally preppy. He dresses in pastel colors with nautical-themed accessories, such as a braided wristband. These traits reflect his upper-class northeastern upbringing.

Relationships
Despite being considered irritating by some of his co-workers, Andy is well-intentioned and typically shows a rapport with his colleagues, as well as a desire to confirm that they are enjoying themselves.

Erin Hannon
In season 6, Andy takes an interest in receptionist Erin Hannon, who has mutual affections, but due to miscommunication, there was a long period where the two waited for the other to make a move. However, Andy eventually asks Erin out on a date, and she graciously accepts. A few months later, after Erin discovers, through Michael Scott, of Andy's former engagement to accountant Angela Martin, she throws cake in Andy's face and decides that they need to take a break from one another. Over a year later, Erin, after breaking up with Gabe Lewis, asks Andy out on a date, but he dismisses her advances, because of his lingering issues with her leaving him for Gabe. When Andy introduces his girlfriend Jessica to the Office at a Christmas party, Erin initially appears friendly to her, but she becomes drunk, and confesses to Andy that she wishes Jessica were dead. Greatly offended, Andy informs Erin that she needs to get over their break-up, and briskly leaves. Upon learning that Erin wishes to live in Tallahassee, Florida, Andy drives to Tallahassee to get back together with Erin. At first, he is unsuccessful, but ultimately gets her back, and they makeup and kiss in the middle of the street. When Andy discovers his job is stolen by Nellie when he and Erin return to the office, he is demoted to salesman again and holds back his anger. The day seems to get worse when their sex life becomes the subject of a staff meeting, embarrassing them. When Nellie makes another quip, Erin snaps and in turn, encourages Andy to finally let his anger loose on Nellie, which later helps Andy get his confidence back and improves their sex life. However, during season 9, their relationship starts to show cracks as Andy comes back from a training seminar that has made him more confident, but seemingly more selfish to Erin. When Andy takes his parents' boat to Bermuda for three weeks, he leaves Erin behind, who looks on disappointed. Erin later goes out with Pete, a new co-worker for drinks. Three weeks later becomes three months, which makes Erin increasingly unhappy after Andy neglects her by being unsociable. Erin later tries to dump Andy in "Couples Discount", until he convinces her that they can fake love each other as his parents did. Erin initially agrees to this until she talks to Pete, who only wants her to be happy. This prompts Erin to finally break up with Andy by citing both his neglect for her and that he was irresponsible for being gone for three months from work. During "Moving On", Andy's distraught behavior affects his professional relationship with Erin and the staff and has him confiding some of the staff, including Pete, whom Erin is dating in secrecy from Andy. When Andy learns of their relationship, he acts irrationally to where Erin and Pete lecture him that he needs to move on. Vengeful, Andy hires both Gabe and Alice (Collette Wolfe), who is Pete's ex-girlfriend and a marketing professional, with the intent of making Erin and Pete uncomfortable. The ploy works to the point where arguments break out between the parties in the conference room, as Erin and Pete's issues with the surface of their past relationships. Andy smugly says to the camera that making the new couple unhappy, has made him feel better. In the episode "Livin' the Dream", Andy and Erin are seen speaking pleasantly to each other and Erin even admits her concern for his well being saying she's worried he'll "be homeless or even starve." Later on during Andy's goodbye song, Erin can be seen watching Andy with a serious look of affection, making it unclear whether or not the two still have romantic feelings for each other. In the Finale Andy, Erin, and even Pete are all shown to be getting along well and spending time together during the after-party in the warehouse, indicating the tensions from earlier have vanished (though it is unclear if Erin and Pete are still a couple at that point, as the episode doesn't provide any evidence in either direction).

Michael Scott
In season 3, Andy transfers to the Scranton branch after Stamford closes. Andy has a strategy to become the number two of the branch by name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake first; Michael immediately likes him. In "A Benihana Christmas", Andy takes Michael to Benihana for lunch to help him get over Carol. Andy convinces Michael to ask out their waitress, Cindy. In "Traveling Salesmen", Andy picks Michael as his traveling salesman partner. During the car ride, Michael tells Andy about Dwight going behind his back and talking to Jan. When they go to do their joint sale pitch, Andy ruins the pitch. Michael is not happy with him. Andy finds the toll booth receipt that shows Dwight went to New York and suggests that he wanted to talk with Jan again. This results in Michael confronting Dwight about going to corporate behind his back and lying to him. As a result, Dwight quits Dunder Muffin. In "The Return", Michael starts to suspect Andy is crazy. When Michael is talking to Jim about Andy, Jim tells Michael that Andy is a yes man and he did the same thing with Josh Porter at the Stamford branch. After Angela tells Michael why Dwight went to New York, Michael decides to leave the office to get Dwight back. Andy tries to come with him and begins telling Michael about his weekend plans for the two of them. Finally, Michael tells him to stop; he realizes he made a mistake trying to replace Dwight with Andy, who “loved this place so much that he punched a hole in it.” Andy is forced to enter anger management, upon his return Michael gives him a second chance, naming him a team captain for the beach games competition and considering him as a potential replacement. For the remainder of the series, Michael is on good terms with Andy, often encouraging the lackluster salesman. In "Goodbye, Michael", Michael gifts Andy all of his Dunder Mifflin clients as a way of motivating him. Although he initially loses one of those clients, Andy's able to maintain a relationship with the others, which greatly boosts his confidence.

Angela Martin
In the fourth season, Andy begins a relationship with accountant Angela Martin, who half-heartedly began dating him on the rebound, after she had broken up with Dwight Schrute (whose relationship with her had been unknown to the majority of the staff). After dating for about seven months, Andy proposes to Angela, during Toby Flenderson's farewell party, and she solemnly accepts. However, during their engagement, she resumes her affair with Dwight. Andy endures tremendous effort in order to prepare Angela's dream wedding. Upon learning about the affair, both he and Dwight break up with her, and Andy is initially crushed. When Andy is leaving the office for good after he quits to seek fame, Angela tries to talk him out of it; Andy wrongly assumes she regrets ending their relationship, and says he does think about her often, but Angela is able to choke back her disgust and she and Andy part ways with a hug. 

Dwight Schrute
Since his arrival, Andy and Dwight had a competitive professional relationship; he and Dwight argued over which title, Assistant Regional Manager (Dwight) or Regional Director in Charge of Sales (Andy), was higher in command. Eventually, the two duel over Angela when it is found she is cheating on Andy with Dwight. After the fight, both relationships end, and Angela is left heartbroken and alone. A few months later, the two soon begin competing for the attention of Erin, but Dwight ultimately decides to cease pursuing her in order to maintain a good relationship with Andy. However, after Andy is hired as Regional Manager, Andy makes Dwight his "Enforcer", in order to stay on good terms, but Dwight later states, in a talking-head interview, that he will simply "wait for Andy's inevitable demise". During "Couples Discount", Dwight is unable to get Andy's sign off on prices with a major sale that Dwight landed, although when Andy suddenly reappears, he chastises Dwight over not having his approval on the prices. When Dwight informs him that Andy was on a boat and unreachable, Andy tries again to maintain his authority. But that backfires when Andy decides to renege on the prices with Dwight's client, thus voiding both a major sale for the company and wrecks Dwight's sales record. Dwight later tells false stories to Andy when the manager is in need of being caught up on his branch, in hopes of sabotaging Andy. When Dwight learns he's in line to become the permanent branch manager and Andy asks if his plan to quit and seek stardom is a good idea, Dwight kindly but firmly tells Andy that he would benefit greatly from Andy's departure but, having seen Andy perform, he thinks Andy should NOT quit his day job. Andy later returns to Scranton to attend Dwight's wedding to Angela. And in a deleted scene from the "Finale," Andy makes a toast to everyone commenting on how there is no one else better for Angela than Dwight Schrute, advising him to "be Dwight Schrute." 

Jim and Pam Halpert
Andy has been the subject of many pranks by Jim and Pam, some of which have caused his anger issues to unfold. Andy also had a romantic interest in Pam, but due to intentionally misleading advice given to him by Jim, it did not develop into a relationship. Although the two will, at times, act considerably mean to Andy, Jim and Pam are often pleasant to him, and even give him advice when he needs it. When Andy goes through a rough breakup, he gives Jim wildly bad advice when he suspects Pam of controlling him. However, Jim uses it as an opportunity to prank Andy throughout the day before he sees through the ruse, prompting Jim to comfort him about finding someone else. Jim is also supportive of both Andy and Darryl when they interview for the position of Regional Manager. After Jim is sent to Tallahassee along with Dwight, Cathy Simms, Erin, Stanley Hudson, and Ryan Howard, Pam and Andy are primarily seen hanging out with each other, with him defending her from a group of young girls leading him to a blackened eye and persistent mocking from the rest of the office.

Darryl Philbin
Initially, Darryl and Andy were foes. Darryl states that Andy once used him as a scapegoat, nearly getting him terminated from his job, for a mistake that Andy had made. Andy also attempts to order Darryl around when Sabre's "Sales is King" policy greatly affects the sales staff's egos. However, over time, the two develop a strong friendship. When Darryl confides in Andy that he wished he had remained a member of the warehouse staff, Andy convinces him to make the most of his position and continue rising in the company. When Darryl is depressed over not winning a lottery that the warehouse staff won and shared, he demands that Andy either terminate him or give him the Manager position. Andy is blunt, but kind, as he informs Darryl the truth about his shortcomings, and Darryl subsequently rededicates himself to his job. When he meets Andy's family, Darryl overhears Andy's father berates him over his status in life, and finally understands why Andy needs to please others, and later participates in cheering Andy up, along with the rest of the staff. Darryl is also one of the few people in the office, along with Jim, Pam, and Erin, who did not accept Nellie Bertram's attempt at usurping Andy's job. Darryl is not impressed with Andy's acting ability, to the point of bluntly saying Andy needs to have a job that will tolerate his inevitable and chronic mistakes (Andy cluelessly thinks Darryl is expressing strong covert support for Andy's dreams) and later avoiding him during the Finale's reunion and other events, but he is visibly impressed with Andy's speech at Cornell and gives him a hug.

Gabe Lewis
While initially having a neutral relationship with Corporate liaison Gabe Lewis, after he began dating Erin in the summer of 2010, Andy has since developed a dislike for him. In the episode, Nepotism, Andy imagines Gabe being eaten by a whale. Gabe becomes irritated with Andy because Andy holds a work meeting that is a thinly veiled attempt to learn whether Gabe and Erin are having sex or not. He bluntly tells Andy that he asked for his permission before pursuing Erin, and says that Andy needs to accept the situation and move on. After Erin breaks up with Gabe, a heartbroken and jealous Gabe begins to heavily resent Andy, and threatens him not to make any advances on Erin. When Andy interviews for the Regional Manager position, Gabe displays a negative, biased opinion of him. Later, he unsuccessfully attempts to convince the CEO of Sabre, Jo Bennett, not to hire Andy as Manager. For the next year (until Gabe is written out of the series), Andy and Gabe are generally rivals, often making snide remarks to one another.

Phyllis Lapin-Vance
In earlier interactions, Andy and Phyllis Lapin-Vance were shown to have a hostile relationship. After Jim hides Andy's cellphone from him, Andy attempts to search for it in Phyllis's desk drawer. She harshly closes it, and Andy loudly exclaims "I don't trust you, Phyllis!". When Andy finds himself attracted to potential client Julia, he questions Phyllis on who she is. Phyllis immediately answers that Julia is "Out of [Andy's] league". An offended Andy attempts to rebuff her opinion, stating that he has been with numerous beautiful women, leading Phyllis to knowingly ask "Sexually?", to which Andy abruptly ends the conversation. When Gabe and Jo are interviewing the staff to find the potential employee that leaked to the press that Sabre's printers catch on fire, Phyllis quietly tells Andy "Put your hand up, Norma Rae". Andy then tells her that if she says anything incriminating about him, he will "Break off the temples of [her] glasses and stick them in [her] eye sockets". Later, when Nick, the IT guy, reveals that Andy was, indeed, the whistleblower, Phyllis hides Andy's carry-on bag in the ceiling, coldly telling him "You deserve it". Throughout the seventh season, however, Andy and Phyllis grow closer, and it is shown that Phyllis truly cares for Andy, wanting the best for him. When Andy is upset about Gabe and Erin's possible sex life, Phyllis agrees to ask Erin leading questions to learn the truth.

Robert California
After becoming the new CEO of Sabre, Robert California appointed Andy as Regional Manager of the Scranton branch. Since then, Andy has developed an awkward relationship with Robert, who he is eager to impress, and highly intimidated by. Robert states that the reason he chose Andy for the Manager position, is because he is "All surface... Uncomplicated, what you see is what you get". Andy and Robert's contentious relationship climaxes when Robert allows Nellie Bertram to usurp Andy's Regional Manager position, and Andy is fired for refusing to accept Nellie as manager, only able to reclaim his managerial role by convincing David Wallace to purchase Dunder Mifflin away from Sabre and Robert.

Character history
Season 3
Andy is introduced in the season 3 premiere as the Regional Director in Charge of Sales at the Stamford branch, where Jim has transferred to. Early season episodes reveal his anger issues, displayed when he finds his calculator encased in Jell-O and when he performs poorly due to Jim's inexperience at Call of Duty.

After the closure of Stamford and merger with Scranton, Andy attempts to gain favor with manager Michael Scott through his quoted tactics of "name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake". There is rivalry with Dwight Schrute over whether his title is higher than that of Dwight's Assistant Regional Manager, fueling an intense power struggle. However, Michael becomes agitated at Andy's sycophantic attitude and poor salesmanship, as does the office at his obnoxious singing. Jim takes matters into his own hands and hides Andy's mobile phone that rings with Andy's rendition of "Rockin' Robin" in the ceiling, enraging him into punching a hole in the office wall. A producer's cut of the episode explains Andy's departure from subsequent episodes as due to being sent to anger management training.

Andy returns a few months later to a short-lived "three-year" shunning courtesy of Dwight. He accompanies Jim to meet with clients from a local high school following an obscene watermark being vandalized onto Dunder Mifflin paper. This unexpected trip leads Andy to the discovery that his girlfriend Jamie is a high school student.

In "Beach Games", Andy captains a team alongside Jim, Dwight and Stanley Hudson in a competition for Michael's selection of the next Regional Manager of the Scranton branch, as Michael believes he is a shoo-in for a position at corporate. However, he falls plight to the sabotage of Angela Martin, who favors Dwight, and ends up in a sumo wrestler costume drifting away into Lake Scranton.

In "The Job", When Dwight is appointed as the regional manager by Michael, Dwight holds tryouts for the Assistant to the Regional Manager position. Andy is the only person to sign up and takes place in several ridiculous interview tactics, such as arm wrestling and asking what kind of color is best. Eventually, since Andy is the only one who applied, he gets the position and spends time like a servant to Dwight before Michael reveals that he didn't get the corporate job and replaces a heartbroken Dwight.

Season 4
With the departure of Karen after Jim dumping her off-screen, Andy becomes the only salesman from Stamford aside from Jim to stay on at the Scranton branch. A preview clip for the fourth season features Andy taking up inner-tubing. The fourth-season premiere, "Fun Run", has Andy competitively participating in Michael's superfluously named run for rabies prevention through strategically drafting Kevin, although he falls prey to "nipple chafing."

Andy develops a friendship with Dwight in the third episode "Launch Party", in which he supports Dwight in beating the online sales of the company website Dunder Mifflin Infinity using a bear horn, much to the irritation of the office. He also develops for Angela Martin and confides his feelings for her to Dwight, unaware that they used to have a romance together. After hearing that Angela desperately needs one, he steals an elaborate ice sculpture for her launch party, and serenades her later in the same episode with a rendition of the ABBA song "Take a Chance on Me", receiving a rare, yet quickly suppressed smile in return. He moonwalks in "Money" by her desk to impress her, although it takes the gift of the cat Garbage (from the previous episode) and a sentimental note to finally win her. Angela and Andy continue to date into "Local Ad", in which Andy consults Dwight on how to pursue more intimacy with Angela. Andy discusses the exclamation of "Oh, D!" Angela exclaims during intimate moments, unaware that Angela may be referring to a nickname for Dwight and not him.

Andy and Kevin successfully team up in the season to recover lost parking spaces taken by renovators of another company in the business park in a meeting of the building tenants, called "The Five Families". He is rebuffed from clubbing in "Night Out" with Michael and Dwight in New York with the newly promoted Ryan by Dwight, who has a rekindled dislike for Andy considering his relationship with Angela. This is evidenced later in "Did I Stutter?" when Dwight uses pressuring negotiation tactics in order to buy Andy's Nissan Xterra at a reduced price, only to flip it for profit on eBay much to Andy's protest.

In "Job Fair", Andy is invited to accompany Jim on a major sales call. However, in a deleted scene, Jim reveals Andy was invited in order to benefit Jim, as Andy's pride for Cornell would push the client- a graduate of Dartmouth- toward him. The scheme plays out as intended when the client invites Kevin to play golf with him again but denies Andy's request to join them.

In "Goodbye, Toby", Andy proposes to Angela (unbeknownst to him, at the same moment Jim had been preparing to propose to Pam) with a ring that he has carried in his wallet for six years, because "You never know when you'll meet the right girl". Angela accepts his proposal with a somewhat irritated "Okay"; shortly thereafter, though, she rekindled her intimate relationship with her former lover, Dwight, which is witnessed by Phyllis and the camera crew, who walk in on them making love by her desk.

Season 5
Between season four and five, Andy plans his wedding with Angela, although his ideas are often rejected by her. Unbeknownst to him is the continual affairs between his fiancée and Dwight. It takes until "Customer Survey" to convince her on a wedding concept, although Angela has manipulated Andy into having the only option to satisfy her demands being Dwight's farm. However, Andy has already placed many non-refundable deposits on other wedding ideas and lost them to Angela's indecisiveness. The NBC/Office website contains a feature where Andy reveals all the details of his and Angela's wedding.

In "Business Trip", Andy and Oscar bond over Andy's failed attempt to set Oscar up, drunkenly calling Angela and asking why they haven't consummated their relationship. Andy does admit Angela makes him a "better man" during his talks with Oscar, although he fails to hear Dwight in the background of the call. In the morning, Angela pushes him back to first base, although Andy feels better from the closer relationship he's gained with Oscar. Angela and Andy later go on a tour of Schrute Farms in "The Surplus", unfortunately for Andy, who continually steps in manure on the grounds of the farm. During a tour of the wedding chapel, Andy portrays Angela's father and Dwight as Andy in a wedding rehearsal that Andy is oblivious to be a real wedding whose marriage license Angela later voids. This forward act by Dwight pushes Angela toward committing to Andy in the long run.



In "Moroccan Christmas", Andy takes up playing the sitar, and brings it to the office Christmas party. While he is in another room, Phyllis reveals that Dwight is having an affair with Angela. Andy then returns, unaware of what the rest of the staff know and decide not to reveal, and goes home with Angela.

In "The Duel", Michael informs him of Angela and Dwight's affair, and Andy responds to this by confronting Dwight and challenging him to a duel. They meet out in the parking lot, where Dwight realizes that Angela has had sex with Andy as well, despite telling Dwight that she had only been sleeping with him. Realizing that they have both been lied to, Andy cancels his wedding cake, and Dwight throws out the bobble head in his likeness, implying the men's relationships with Angela are now over. Andy refers to Angela on his registry as "The maid of DIS-honor".

In the beginning of "Stress Relief", the staff is trapped in the office while under the impression that it is on fire. Everyone panics, and Andy attempts to escape out one of the doors, but burns his hand, as Dwight had previously heated it with a propane torch. When Dwight sets off firecrackers, Andy believes that "The fire's shooting at [them]!". He then teams up with Jim, and they attempt to use the copier as a battering ram, against one of the locked doors. Later, at Michael's Roast, Andy writes a song about how unintelligent Michael is, aptly called "What I Hate About You".

In a deleted scene from "Lecture Circuit", Andy is shown to have a McCain-Palin bumper sticker on his car, which he scrapes off because he is romantically interested in Julia, an African-American, potential client, who he presumably assumes voted for Barack Obama (although, it is also possible that he only had the sticker to appease Angela, who is a Conservative). He later attempts to kiss Julia, and she politely, but firmly rebuffs him. Later, he miserably notes that Dunder Mifflin also lost the account.
In "Blood Drive", when Michael holds a meeting for the Lonely Hearts Club party, he inquires as to Andy's whereabouts, since he is nowhere to be seen. Oscar informs the other staff that Andy is attending one of his honeymoons, which puzzles Michael. Oscar then explains that when Andy was making plans for the wedding, he put down non-refundable deposits at multiple destinations, and ended up going to all of them, to fulfill the deposit. Andy is later called "that new jackass" by Bob Vance, when he and Phyllis are having lunch with Jim and Pam.

In "Golden Ticket", Andy gives Kevin romantic advice that appears to reflect his own experiences with Angela: he tells him to never give his date compliments, push for physical contact, or be assertive to the point of rudeness.
In a deleted scene, Andy refers to Angela as "Satan".

In "New Boss", he is one of the observers of Michael's immature antics when he starts repeating everything that the new boss, Charles Miner, says. With the rest of the staff, Andy insists that Michael stop before he makes things worse for himself and for everyone else.

In "Two Weeks", Andy gives Michael a bottle of wine as a farewell gift, and Michael indirectly insults him.

Andy continues to develop a friendship and an attraction to Erin, which began late in the fifth season. However, the pair are both too timid to reveal their feelings for one another.

Michael does smooth things over a bit with Erin, but Erin does not change her mind about breaking up with him, and Andy remains distraught.

During "The Cover-Up", one of his clients informs him that their Sabre printer catches fire, which worries Andy. When he decides to investigate the matter, he enlists Darryl to assist him. However, Darryl wants to get revenge on Andy for almost getting him fired a while back over mistaken shipments, and goes along with the ploy by playing up his fears. But when Andy video tapes the printer that catches on fire, it confirms his suspicions. This prompts Darryl to call off his prank, when he realizes it could get himself in trouble.

When Michael is revealed to be dating a married woman in "The Chump", Andy is furious because of his own cuckolding at Angela's hands, and is driven to make Michael realize the error of his ways.

In "Whistleblower", the press gets word of Sabre's printers catching fire, the company's CEO Jo Bennett (Kathy Bates) goes out of her way to find the culprit. Andy initially denies it, even though he is accused of this. But he eventually comes clean with the truth by admitting to submitting a letter to a news editor and the video he recorded of a printer catching fire. Andy admits this as he doesn't want to see the printer fire cause a catastrophe to a school or hospital, but finds himself harassed throughout the day by the sales staff when they all suspect he did it.

Erin ultimately is revealed to have been watching from the back, Cece in tow, to Andy's delight and to Jim and Pam's chagrin.

In "Sex Ed", he holds a sex education seminar for the office because people are insulting Meredith, but is really only doing so to find out if Erin and Gabe are sleeping together (the answer is "Yes").

Later Gabe bluntly tells Andy to never behave like that again, especially after Andy gave Gabe permission to ask Erin out over the previous summer, but Darryl cheers him up.

In "Ultimatum", Andy reveals that his New Year's resolution is to "learn how to cook for one", since his regular cooking leaves him with twice as much food as he needs.

In "PDA", Erin asks Andy to tag along on a romantic treasure hunt Gabe has made for her, despite the fact that Andy is now dating a friend of Darryl's named Rachel. Andy is at first reluctant but relents at Erin's friendly urging. The hunt starts with a puzzle picture, which leads to Gabe's stereo in Darryl's office, which leads to glow in the dark stars in Ryan's closet, leading to sparkling cider with Hank the security guard, and finally to a Valentine's cookie in the break room. When the cookie tells her to enjoy her Valentine's kiss, Erin thinks she's supposed to kiss Andy. Andy points out Gabe blowing a kiss through the window and leaves awkwardly.

When the staff gathers in the Conference Room to see the screening of Michael's movie "Threat Level Midnight" in the episode of the same name, Andy is shown playing a character with a New Jersey accent named Billy the Bartender. Jim starts laughing uncontrollably at a particular scene, causing everyone else to laugh with him. Michael angrily stops the movie and takes it away, to which everyone protests, including Andy, who says that some people are doing a superb job in the movie.

In "Todd Packer", when office administrator Pam gets a new computer for the receptionist's desk to replace the current, ancient one, Andy wants a new computer too. Pam states that if she were to get a new computer for one sales rep (Andy), she would have to get one for every sales rep, which leads the entire office into believing that new computers are being freely handed out. Since Pam refuses to give him a new computer, Andy switches his computer with Erin, a trade Erin seems to be fine with. Pam is angry with him, saying that the computer was not meant for Erin personally but for the receptionist's desk in general, and therefore it was not hers to switch. Pam tells Andy that the only way he can get a new computer is if his breaks, which leads to him accepting all cookies, intentionally opening pop-up ads, and placing food in the disc drive. Pam then buys Andy a new computer, which they scratch up so it figures into Pam's fake cover story (finding a spare model in the warehouse), and Pam later doles out some vacation days to Darryl to keep the whole lie nicely bottled up.

In "Garage Sale", Andy, Darryl, and Kevin play and bet on the Dallas board game. As the instruction booklet is not with the game, Andy and Darryl make up the rules as they go along, much to Kevin's objection.

As Darryl and Andy look at each other in confusion, Kevin reveals to the cameras that he has the money, stating, "And that... is Dallas", mocking Andy and Darryl's previous statement.

In "Training Day", new branch manager Deangelo Vickers designates Andy as the office "funny guy".

In "Michael's Last Dundies", after winning the "Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year" Dundie Award (since he tried Marijuana in College), Andy leads the employees in serenading the soon-to-depart Michael with "9,986,000 Minutes", an a cappella version of "Seasons of Love" with altered lyrics.

In "Goodbye, Michael", Andy is given Michael's client list as a going away present, and after losing one, requests the help of Deangelo to retain them. Deangelo nearly screws up a relationship with a client, but Andy gains enough confidence to salvage the sale.

In "The Inner Circle", Andy is shown to want in on Deangelo's "inner circle" of office workers, but changes his mind about Deangelo when the women say he's sexist. However, when Jim brings the rumor of Deangelo being sexist to his boss's attention, he replaces Jim with Andy, who eagerly accepts. While Andy says he's going to infiltrate and change from within the circle, as soon as he steps into Deangelo's office, he calls the meeting place "man cave" and barks like a dog before closing the door.
