<html><p>In "Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager" Gabe makes Andy promise not to date Erin (while crying) to which Andy agrees in order to get Gabe out of the room. When Dwight becomes the interim manager, Andy suffers temporary hearing loss when Dwight accidentally fires a gun near him. Erin runs to his side out of concern. Later, when Andy and Erin are talking, Gabe tells Erin what Andy said about them not dating, but Andy shuts Gabe up by pointing out Gabe's pathetic crying fit, and tells both of them that he's keeping his final view on whether he wants to date Erin or not "between me and my diary".

In "Search Committee" Andy interviews to replace Michael/Deangelo as the regional manager, which Gabe tries to sabotage. Also, Erin asks Andy out on a date and he eventually refuses, claiming that he has gotten over her. However, Andy later tells the camera that he does think Erin is great. Andy also remains a managerial candidate once Gabe's behavior gets him transferred out of Scranton, and tells the office he won't make any changes at all, but his status like everyone else's is left unclear as the episode ends.

Season 8
Robert California, selected by the search committee, declines to become Branch Manager and convinces Jo Bennett to give him her position as CEO, thus giving Robert the authority to appoint Andy as the new manager between the events of "Search Committee" and "The List". Upon discovering a list that divides the office into winners and losers and being moved into the loser division after questioning Robert about it, he retaliates by hosting a pizza party for the losers and publicly confronts Robert with the positive attributes of the losers. This act earns the respect of Robert and the office, in addition to an extended Columbus Day weekend.

In "The Incentive", Robert California urges the doubling of sales growth, which Andy attempts to fulfill with an incentive program. This program spirals out of control when Andy has one of the prizes of the program to be a tattoo on his posterior, worth 5,000 points. In comedic fashion, the office pools their points and succeeds in winning this prize, to which Andy bravely owns up to, only for the office to change the originally more-raunchy tattoo design ( A baby coming out of his behind) to one that honors Andy's nickname of "The Nard Dog." Robert, in an aside in the episode, reveals that Andy's selection as the Regional Manager was done because he's a simple underdog whom people will rally behind.

In "Lotto", after six warehouse workers win $950,000 in a lottery pool, and quit in a celebratory fashion of running through the office, Andy has a hard time finding any office workers who will step in for the day and make sure that the day's important orders shipped out. Darryl, depressed from the fact that he didn't win the lottery because he works in the office now, assembles a conference room meeting with several potential new hires, but utters several discouraging remarks about the job and exits, leaving Andy alone to take charge of the process. Andy doesn't know what he's doing and all of the workers simply leave. Darryl blames himself for the failure and asks Andy to fire him, but Andy refuses, thinking/hoping Darryl is speaking in code. Later, Andy finally manages to hire three warehouse workers. Andy steps up when Darryl tells him to give him the manager job, saying he deserves it and wants that or a pink slip, and bluntly tells Darryl he not only isn't going to do that, but Darryl was not the runner-up to Andy in the selection process; as he brings up Darryl's short temper, his hiring of the unqualified Glen, and his loss of interest in taking business education courses, Darryl finally snaps out of his funk and listens to him. Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him, and he simply stopped striving after that. He convinces Darryl to stay on board.

During "Garden Party", Andy throws a garden party to impress Robert with his parents Walter (Stephen Collins), Ellen (Dee Wallace) and younger brother Walter, Jr. (Josh Groban) in attendance. However, it's evident that Andy is also trying to prove himself to his parents, who were under the impression that he was CEO of the company until later. He goes to great lengths to try and impress them, even with a toast that gets progressively worse when Andy resents his father and brother performing a duet that Andy tried performing with his father. This indicates that Walter, Jr., who was given his father's name when the Bernards decided that it was better suited to him than soon-to-be-Andy, remains the clear favorite son. When Walter, Sr. later goes to speak with Andy, he insults his job and says Andy needs to stop seeking his approval like a little kid would. This conversation is overheard by Jim, Pam, Darryl, Oscar and Erin via Jim and Pam's baby monitor, prompting everyone to understand why Andy feels the need to get everyone to like him. After his family leaves, Andy feels dejected and plans to head home himself, but Darryl and Oscar cheer him up with food from their impromptu barbecue, and Andy finishes his day smiling as he enjoys good food and company.

In "Spooked", Andy dresses up as a construction worker. He assigns Erin to set up the Halloween party, as he wants to live up to the expectations set by Robert. When Robert arrives, he notices that the party is more tailored to kids than adults. Andy asks Angela and Phyllis to help take over and re-tailor the party and asks to speak with Erin at the end of the day. Andy and Robert later talk with Erin in his office regarding Erin accidentally ruining the Halloween party by putting on a disturbing movie of Gabe's creation. Erin says she got nervous when Andy asked to have a talk with her and that she thought he was about to fire her over the party. However, Andy tells her he's dating someone, and she is shocked to hear they've been out on 31 dates so far. Erin doesn't speak up and leaves dejectedly, however, at the end of the episode, Erin talks to Andy about her feelings.

In the cold open of "Doomsday", Andy, to commemorate and "bring closure" to the end of each work day, plays "Closing Time", much to the dismay of his visibly annoyed co-workers. Andy, frustrated that no one but him and Erin enjoy the tradition, starts to scold the workers until Stanley comes in happily singing the song alongside him. After it is discovered that an accounting error lead to a client getting a free order, Robert tells Andy to clamp down on the mistakes. In turn, Andy enlists Dwight to implement a system, nicknamed "The Doomsday Device", which can record five errors and generate an automatic email report to Robert, putting fear into the office. Realizing this could jeopardize his staff, Andy along with Erin, Pam and Kevin try to talk Dwight out of sending the email to Robert.

In "Pam's Replacement", Andy, Darryl and Kevin have another jam session in the warehouse where Robert joins them. But they're eventually phased out when Robert's more talented bandmates step in. The three end up having their own jam session outside by the dumpsters.

Andy takes much of the staff to "Gettysburg" as part of a motivational speech, but his attempt to galvanize the staff in relation to the historic war, does little. Fed up, Andy storms off and later argues with Jim, who tells Andy that the staff simply like him as a manager, and that he doesn't have to prove himself to them, putting Andy at comfort.

Andy meets "Mrs. California" and at Robert's hasty instruction, is not supposed to hire his wife Susan, for a job in the office. Although in front of his spouse, Robert contradicts his instruction quite well, leaving Andy and later Jim in a hard place when Andy is trying to not hire her. When Susan is hired and then later quits her job, Andy goes to speak with her and she asks him out on a date, leaving him in shock.

In "Christmas Wishes", Andy dresses up as Santa for the office's annual Christmas party as an effort to makes everyone's holiday wish comes true. He also introduces Jessica, his new girlfriend to the office, much to the confusion and later drunken chagrin of Erin, who resents her. Erin drunkenly tells Andy that her Christmas wish is for Jessica to die, offending and angering Andy. He tells Erin to get over the fact that he turned her down for a date and storms off. Although when he suspects Erin is getting unusually close to Robert when he drives her home, he tails them to her apartment as Meredith's designated driver. But to his relief, he sees Robert hug Erin goodbye with comforting words and instructs her to take care of her hangover.

Desperate to meet the company's sales quota to impress Robert, Andy tries numerous methods to reach the number such as buying up paper stock himself and asking Oscar to "fix" the sales quota number. However, Oscar informs him of a "Trivia" night he's attending in Philadelphia with a $2,000 cash prize. Andy gets the idea to bring the staff with him in an effort to win the prize, only to be surprised that they end up in a gay bar. To Oscar and his trivia team's chagrin, the staff splits off into teams and to Oscar and Andy's surprise, the underdog team of Kevin (whom Andy passive-aggressively rejected for his team), Erin, Kelly and Meredith win the cash prize for the office to meet their quota.

Seemingly despondent over his impending divorce, Robert hosts an impromptu "Pool Party" at his soon-to-be-sold mansion. The staff attends with Andy and his girlfriend, much to Erin's consternation. Andy carries around the engagement ring his parents had, which he claims that his parents fell head over heels in love with Jessica. Desperate for Andy's attention, Erin enlists Dwight and they engage in a series of competitive pool games with Andy and Jessica. Later on, Dwight asks Andy about his love life as he's trying to find out how Andy feels about Erin, which Andy deflects with weak answers, prompting Dwight to tell Andy "you're an idiot" before walking away in disgust. At one point during the night, Andy accidentally loses the ring and goes frantically searching for it but to no avail. However, Erin recovers the ring in the pool and gives it to Andy, knowing the history behind the ring. Andy confides to Erin that he's confused about his relationship with Jessica, which gives Erin hope.

In "Last Day in Florida", Andy learns that Erin isn't coming back to Scranton, and he realizes he still loves her. He decides to go to Florida to win her back and does so during "Get the Girl", later respectively breaking up with Jessica, saying he was gay to do so, but later returning and admitting to his lie, soon after returning with Erin. However, while he is in Florida, Nellie claims the manager position at Scranton and Andy is demoted to salesman. After one of his anger outbursts ("Angry Andy") he is fired from Dunder Mifflin.

In "Fundraiser", Andy sees David Wallace at the fundraiser and learns that the U.S. military bought the patent for his failed children's toy clean up device "Suck It" for 20 million dollars.

In "Turf War", Andy manages to win a major client and uses it as leverage to get David Wallace to purchase Dunder Mifflin. He also calls Robert and threatens to get him fired if David buys the company.

In "Free Family Portrait Studio", Andy returns to the office and pretends to be hopeless and jobless and begs Nellie for a job. Andy reveals he's faking this to the documentary crew and that David Wallace is going to buy back Dunder Mifflin, fire Nellie and Robert, and reinstate Andy as manager. While Andy is reinstated, Robert swindles his way into getting a million dollars from David and Andy hires Nellie out of guilt and sorrow.

Season 9
In "New Guys", it is revealed that Andy was sent to Outward Bound manager training by David Wallace, which caused him to revert to his cockier and meaner persona from season 3. He wants revenge on Nellie for what happened during the second half of season 8. In the episode, Andy aggressively pushes Nellie off of a slack-line that he set up in the parking lot.

In "Andy's Ancestry", Nellie pranks Andy into believing that he is related to Michelle Obama, which concerns the office and makes them wonder if his family owned slaves. Andy then phones his mother asking whether this is true. He then tells the office that his family did not own slaves, but they did transport them.

In "Work Bus", Andy continues to torment Nellie, especially when she needs an employer's signature to verify her employment to an adoption agency. He refuses in front of the entire office, which upsets her and Erin. Andy later finds Erin crying after this, which prompts him to sign the papers and add in a few kind words in the paper saying how good a mother Nellie could potentially be.

In "Here Comes Treble" and "The Boat", Andy discovers his father has abandoned their family, leaving them nearly penniless. He consults with Oscar and Darryl to sell enough family assets for his mother to live. He resists their urging that he sell off their family boat, which Andy had always wanted to drive, but finally relents to sell it to a dealer in the Bahamas. During this, Erin attempts to cheer him up, though Andy doesn't appear receptive until she suggests they drive up to Connecticut to see off the boat themselves. Once there, Andy discovers his brother Walter Jr., disheveled and hung over, in one of the cabins. Andy decides to sail the boat to the Bahamas himself, along with Walter Jr., leaving Erin behind. Though grateful to Erin for cheering him up, he doesn't notice how hurt she is at being left behind.

In "The Whale", Andy, still sailing to the Bahamas, communicates with Erin and several of his co-workers. After three days, he appears badly sunburned, dehydrated, and somewhat affected by the isolation. Their conversation is cut short when Andy's computer falls off the boat into the ocean.

Andy was not seen during the subsequent eight episodes, as Ed Helms was busy filming The Hangover Part III.

In "Dwight Christmas", Andy sends Erin a text message (off-screen) saying he and Walter Jr. have arrived in the Bahamas. Andy decides to stay there for several more weeks to find himself, something that upsets Erin greatly, and causes her to become closer to her friend and co-worker Pete Miller.

Andy returns in "Couples Discount" in a rapidly different appearance as a result of being away from three months in the Bahamas. He surprises the staff by returning a day early and immediately alienates everyone with stupid, tone-deaf behavior: ignorantly expecting the staff to take him seriously as if he never left, voiding a major sale that Dwight had with Jan Levinson, shamelessly collecting his paychecks plus the "merit bonus" he acquired for the staff excelling their sales quota. He holds a meeting with the staff in order to catch up on what he missed, so to meet with David Wallace, who has been under the impression that Andy has been at the office the entire time via phone calls and e-mails. The staff in turn, tell him false stories that he manages to spin when meeting with David and he manages to get through the meeting without repercussions. However Erin, after feeling 3 months of neglect from Andy, plans to break up with him until he convinces him that they can fake love each other like his parents. Although Erin later decides against this, and dumps Andy for mistreating her and for being irresponsible by skipping work, a conversation heard by David Wallace on speakerphone, who asks Andy "What was that about three months?"

Distraught over their breakup in "Moving On", Andy's professional relationship with Erin and the rest of the staff is bad. David Wallace chastises Andy in a closed door meeting but allows him to keep his job, thanking Andy for getting him the company, but warns him that he's on very thin ice for his antics. When he tries imposing his authority over Pam, Dwight and Angela when they leave mid-day, he finds himself subject to insults related to his three months away. Throughout the day, Andy avoids work-related matters such as client messages if they come from Erin. He confides in Clark and Pete, the latter whom is secretly dating Erin and Erin confides that keeping their relationship secret from Andy, has kept the relationship "hot". Andy is suspicious of Erin dating someone else, as he goes through her cell phone, and is later able to figure out that Pete is her new beau. Andy impulsively fires Pete, who turns to Toby, who tells Andy that he can't fire Pete over a personal grudge, even when Andy tries to crush up the relationship agreement form that Erin and Pete signed. Erin and Pete start lecturing Andy that he needs to move on, turning Andy vengeful. He decides to hire their exes such as Alice (Collette Wolfe), a marketing consultant and Gabe to the branch in a bid to make Erin and Pete uncomfortable. The ploy works to the point where arguments break out in the conference room between the parties, as Erin and Pete's past relationship issues surface. Andy smugly says to the camera that seeing Erin and Pete unhappy has made him feel better.

During "The Farm", Andy along with the rest of the staff falls victim to Todd Packer's revenge prank by eating drug-laden cupcakes that Todd gave to the staff. The documentary features footage of both Andy and Kevin engaging in strange antics as a result of hallucinating from drugs.

In '"Stairmageddon", as promos circulate for the documentary series about the branch, Andy comes to realize that he's disillusioned about his job. Inspired to follow his acting dreams, Andy makes a series of calls to talent agencies with no success. However, he ends up meeting real estate/talent agent Carla Fern (Roseanne Barr), who takes Andy on as a client. Andy pays her $5,000 to sign with her agency without headshots included.

Andy books his first job in an industrial film about a chemical lab in "Paper Airplane", where he plays a lab employee. Throughout the shoot, Andy ends up annoying the production crew with frequent suggestions. However, Andy gets cold feet when he has to perform a stunt by pouring cold water in his eyes as to re-enact a chemical burn scenario. Carla sternly warns Andy to get his act together or he won't book any more work. With Darryl's encouragement, Andy does the stunt and at his insistence, does it twice. Carla exclaims "The kid can act!"

Inspired to finally go for his dreams, Andy musters up the courage to quit his job in "Livin' the Dream". Although he was initially going to be fired by David Wallace as Andy's pursuit of his career came at the expense of his job such as auditioning during the work day for student films, buying an expensive photo printer with company money for his head shots and asking David to pay for facial cheek implants during a teleconference. However, Andy hands in his resignation before David can fire him, leaving David relieved. Although when Andy makes the announcement to the office, they all dismiss his dreams as being a giant mistake, which everyone repeatedly tells him throughout the day. Without life savings to support himself, Andy accepts Wallace's offer to stay on as a salesman under the new manager, Dwight. However, after Andy witnesses Dwight proudly proclaim himself as the new manager, he decides to quit again and pursue his dreams. Intending to burn his bridges with Dunder Mifflin, Andy takes drastic measures to get fired. After Toby refuses to enter falsified information into his record, Andy attempts to grope Toby, reveals to David that he out of spite to Dwight did lose a major client in the past and initiates an ugly argument with David Wallace. Initially irritated at his actions, David becomes enraged and fires Andy, who then defecates on his car. After packing up, Andy comes back to the office to say goodbye, by performing a moving rendition of Sarah McLachlan's song "I Will Remember You" with his acoustic guitar. Surprised by Andy's performance, everyone stands up and claps as they all embrace him and say goodbye. The staff is later convinced that Andy may just have some talent after all.

Andy's journey on the show ends in a wildly uneven manner. In "A.A.R.M.", he heads off to an audition for a reality TV show called "America's Next Great A Capella Star". The line to get into the show is so heavy that Andy is told when he's next to audition that they're sending him and everyone else home. Andy bursts into the audition room, demands that the hosts give him a chance, and proceeds to burst into a terrible off-key rendition that has them telling him he's simply not good. Andy then has a full-on crying breakdown that becomes fully evident in the series finale, where he glumly notes that the viral video of him losing it became a heavily viewed YouTube clip (with Andy as "Baby Wawa") that inspired successful parodies and even mocking on "Saturday Night Live". Darryl avoids him at the Scranton airport and his former co-workers awkwardly try to avoid embarrassing him. But Andy tells the guys at Dwight's bachelor party that after he was invited to give a commencement address at Cornell University as a joke, he did so well that he got hired to work in Cornell's Admissions Office. Andy's confidence and ease around everyone increases when he stunningly realizes that most of the crowd at the documentary reunion panel are not only there to see him but are genuine fans of his portrayal on the show, when they all collectively chant his signature catchphrase, "Roo-doo-doo-doo-doo." After the wedding when everyone has returned to the office, they watch Andy's Cornell speech and are unanimously impressed by it; Darryl gives his old friend a hug, and Andy reflects on his time at Dunder Mifflin, nearly breaks into tears as he tells the camera, "I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them."  

On the NBC website, it is revealed that Andy got married some point after the finale. He is auditioning for the current Here Comes Treble band.

Behind the scenes
Andy's trademark "Rid-dit-dit-di-doo" was something that some of Ed Helms's middle school classmates used. It was an expression of triumph after getting off a good zinger.
Former NBC executive Kevin Reilly, who was instrumental in keeping The Office on the air (and who cameoed in "The Return"), is involved with Cornell, and whenever he speaks at classes, someone asks if Andy Bernard is based on him.
