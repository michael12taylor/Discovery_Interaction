In "Goodbye, Michael", Michael tries to say his farewells to Kelly, but in seeing that she isn't listening, is annoyed by his presence and busy doing her makeup, Michael asks if the greatest gift he could give to her at the moment is for him to just leave her alone. She immediately tells him to stop talking in "that weird slow voice." 

In "The Inner Circle", Ryan lies to their new manager, Deangelo Vickers, about being Kelly's boss and asks that she play along. When Kelly asks why she should, Ryan says that he would lie for her, too, and Kelly immediately says, "Yeah, but you lie all the time. You lie for no reason. Ryan, you just like to lie." Ryan follows this up by saying "I'd die for you too." And gullibly enough, she falls for it asking if he really would. Kelly is soon after seen having a phone conversation with her mother, which implies she going to use this situation to blackmail Ryan into being a better boyfriend, when she says "he’s not going to stand us up like he did last time. He won’t ever stand us up again."

Kelly is present in the bullpen when Dwight accidently fires an antique Beaumont Adams gun. The rest of the office uses this as an opportunity to blackmail him, and Kelly demands that they get the day off tomorrow so she go to her American Idol audition, before proceeding to sing about how Dwight went on a "shooting spree," in her own words. 

In "Search Committee", and in the aftermath of Dwight being demoted from acting manager by Jo, Kelly interviews for the manager job, stating one her reasons as the fact that she's managed her department for years. Jim notes that her department is comprised of only herself, and Kelly responds by saying "Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage." Gabe, who doesn't take her interview too seriously, tries to rush the interviewing, noting that they have many more serious candidates. Kelly is angered by this and after Gabe asks her what her weaknesses are, she yells, "I don't have any, asshole!" 

Kelly then gets Gabe thrown off the Search Committee after explaining to Jo his former relationship with Erin and his vendetta against Andy, who is also applying for the manager job, with her calling Gabe "a crazy stalker psycho." Jo later agrees to this, and takes Gabe with her back to Tallahassee. Upon his departure, Kelly tries to hug him but is grossed out by how bony he is.

When Dwight is assigned by Andy to form a team to travel to Tallahassee, Florida for the launch of a chain of Sabre electronic stores, Ryan asks that he or Kelly be sent to Florida, but not at the same time, so that he can be away from her. Andy, being given this choice, decides to send Ryan ("Special Project").

Over the course of the Tallahassee story arc, Kelly is bored without Ryan and occasionally entertained by whatever new drama may happen in the office. Not long after Ryan returns, however, she is set up with Pam and Jim's pediatrician, Ravi, and breaks up with Ryan. 

For the entirety of the episode, "Angry Andy", Ryan attempts to win her back, admitting to Pam and Jim that he would rather she be alone than with someone else. She then admits in a talking head interview that while she feels Ravi actually cares about her, Ryan put her through so much drama, and that she would have to choose which one's more important to her. In the end, she decides to stay with Ravi. 

In "Free Family Portrait Studio", Kelly and Ravi are briefly seen together having their picture taken, with Ravi saying, "I do adore you."

Season 9
Kelly and Ravi eventually get engaged and Ravi accepts a job at Miami University. Kelly decides to move with him and tosses all her coats to the office staff on her last day of work. However, it is revealed that while Kelly believes it's in Florida, Miami University is actually in Ohio ("New Guys"). 

Kelly and Ravi attend Dwight and Angela's wedding and run into Ryan and his baby. She loves the baby's name, Drake, and believes he is named after the hip hop artist. She and Ryan look at each other during Dwight and Angela's wedding. Ryan later gives Drake to Ravi and tells him that he has a rash. Ravi takes Drake inside and Ryan reveals that he had let Drake suck on a strawberry to which he is allergic. While a normal person would be horrified that Ryan did so, Kelly finds it romantic and the two begin to kiss. Ryan and Kelly can later be seen running off into the sunset to start a new life together leaving Ravi and Drake behind ("Finale").
