<html><p>Chaos Magic Manipulation:      Maximoff displaying her Chaos Magic   Able to harness Chaos Magic, Maximoff was the realization of the myth of the Scarlet Witch, a being capable of spontaneous creation. She can shape and manipulate this magic for different effects, such as forming tangible constructs of energy or cast spells without incantation. Her magic is primarily composed of the same red energy as her psionic powers, but mixed with darker red and black hues. At first, Maximoff had no control over this power, however, upon studying the Darkhold, Maximoff gained more experience in the control of her magic.
Reality Manipulation: Maximoff can warp reality. She accomplishes this by manipulating molecular polarity, allowing her numerous other capabilities. Maximoff's reality warping abilities began initially on a small scale, however, as time progressed, her powers have grown exponentially. Maximoff can also create small zones where reality follows her wishes and rules. The areas are surrounded by a partially invisible force field and appear normal from the outside, as when she took control of Westview the town looked normal from the outside even though the reality had completely changed inside. When a person or object enters the area, it automatically becomes part of the reality. Using this ability, Maximoff was able to take control of Westview by placing a hexagonal force field around the town called the Hex, which emits a type of radiation known as CMBR, a remnant radiation from the Big Bang. Inside the Hex, Maximoff has absolute power and can change anything to suit her thinking, being able to create a perfect world based on classic sitcoms, as well as use her powers to rewrite reality and make any person and any object adapt to the time in which they were live in Westview, demonstrated when she had Rambeau's bulletproof vest changed to fit the clothing of her world of classic sitcoms. In fact, every rewritten object inside the Hex, when it exits Westview, remains the same as it was inside, containing the same microscopic elements of their original forms. Due to the authentic sitcom setting, certain abilities also took on different forms within the Hex, such as the lack of energy discharge in the early eras, or the appearance of red smoke rather than energy when imitating Harkness's teleportation. This extended to Vision as well, whose powers were symbolized by the appearance of sparkles during the 1950s. The Hex could alter almost all aspects of reality, including the behavior, thoughts, and memories of the people living inside it, as well as the entire flow of time, all to Maximoff's will. However, inadvertently, the spell was flawed, which caused the suppressed consciousnesses of the Westview residents to still be capable of basic sentience, but removing their willpower. Essentially, they were aware of what they were doing, but were not capable of controlling their own actions. Additionally, every resident ended up feeling the same grief and sorrow Wanda felt over Vision. This was so emotionally taxing on them that it led to some residents becoming suicidal. Although at first the Hex was only found around Westview, when Vision came out of the barrier and nearly died, Maximoff expanded the Hex to save him, also causing everything in his path to be rewritten, transforming the S.W.O.R.D. base into a circus and its agents into clowns. The Hex is able to do this even if Wanda is not aware of it, as the Hex began to immediately disassemble Vision's vibranium body after he left, but Wanda was unaware of it happening. Due to the nature of the Hex, Harkness described it as "magic on autopilot" because the Hex was capable of rewriting reality to fit Wanda's vision automatically without Wanda needing to say any incantations or even having to think about it. However, the magic of the Hex does not seem to work on people or objects that have not passed through its border first, as when Hayward's troops entered the Hex, they weren't affected by it because they never passed through the Hex itself. After gaining more control of her power by transforming into the Scarlet Witch, Maximoff was able to make the Hex disappear completely, reversing the changes it caused to everything and everyone that were still inside.
Conjuration: With a wave of her finger she was able to create wedding rings for herself and Vision. During the magic show on Westview, Maximoff was able to conjure a small crane to cover up Vision's flight. Later on she was able to create a dog collar for Sparky. It was later revealed this was how she was able to conjure a copy of her deceased lover, Vision, within Westview with Chaos Magic, as well as creating an entire house for them to live in.
Life Creation: Within the Hex, Maximoff could create living organisms, like her twin sons Billy and Tommy, though they would be destroyed if they left the Hex.
Time Manipulation: Within the Hex, Wanda could control the passage of time for all of Westview, notably causing the time period within the town to change overnight and even accelerating the day and night cycle to fit the length of her sitcom episodes. Maximoff reverted a whole chicken into its egg form and later reversed the entire flow of time inside her reality by saying "no" in response to a S.W.O.R.D. agent crawling out of a sewer. While expanding the Hex to save Vision, Maximoff caused time in Westview to completely stop.
Teleportation: During the talent show she instantly transported Geraldine from backstage into the magic box. In her battle with Harkness, Maximoff was also able to disappear and reappear behind her, leaving behind a trail of red smoke as she did, imitating Harkness's own teleportation.
Transmutation: Maximoff was able to change her dress, transformed a real piano into a fake cardboard cutout, turned her and Vision's beds into a single bed, brought color to Westview and also brought fake butterflies on a mobile to life without meaning to. Maximoff was able to make herself four months pregnant inadvertently, and also caused her to give birth at a logarithmic rate. When dealing with pain from her contractions Maximoff inadvertently changed her coat several times and also accidentally brought life to a stork from a painting, however, when Maximoff tried to get rid of the stork, she was unsuccessful, as the most she could do was cause a puff of red dust to erupt around it. As her mental stability deteriorated, she further lost control of her surroundings, and began to inadvertently change objects in her home into versions from previous sitcom eras. While battling Agatha Harkness, Wanda used this ability to appear as if her life force had been drained by Agatha, including masking and hiding her psionic energy while flying in order to trick Harkness into thinking she had lost, when in actuality, she was preparing runes around the Hex to strip Harkness of  her magic. Once the Hex was reversed by Wanda, everything and everyone changed by it, provided they were still inside it, reverted back to their original forms, including the clothing Wanda herself was initially wearing when she inadvertently created it. Maximoff also can transform herself from her civilian clothes to her Scarlet Witch uniform and back at will.
Electricity Manipulation: Maximoff turned a light on and off with her hand and later, while experiencing contractions, Maximoff caused a power surge that intensified the light from a ceiling light and caused a power outage that affected the whole block.
Weather Manipulation: When Maximoff's water broke she caused a rainstorm to erupt within the Vision Residence. After the rain stopped, she generated intense winds to pour in from outside in order to dry herself, Vision, and her house.
Fire Manipulation: While experiencing contractions, Maximoff ignited a fire within the fireplace and caused it to intensify before dying down.
Water Manipulation: While experiencing contractions, Maximoff caused a faucet to spew water and a washing machine to overflow with water.

Water Manipulation: While experiencing contractions, Maximoff caused a faucet to spew water and a washing machine to overflow with water.
Protection Spell: Learned from Harkness, Maximoff used a protection spell via magic runes on the walls of the Hex that neutralized Harkness's magic, and revitalized Maximoff's own magic, even after having been drained of it.
Energy Absorption: Maximoff displayed the ability to absorb Agatha Harkness' Dark Magic and transform it into Chaos Magic, amplifying her own magic to an even greater extent. Unlike Harkness, who also needs to absorb life force in order to absorb magic from others, Maximoff is capable of absorbing magic and energy without killing her target.
Astral Projection: Unlike traditional astral projection, Maximoff was able to project her astral form without losing consciousness of her physical self. She accomplished this by manifesting the Scarlet Witch outside of her own body, as demonstrated when she studied the Darkhold in her astral form, whilst also brewing a cup of tea in her physical form.
Abilities
Gifted Intellect: Maximoff was able to learn and replicate Agatha Harkness' Teleportation and Protection Spell Casting just by seeing it once.
Scarlet Witch fighting Thanos
Expert Combatant: Maximoff was originally a poor fighter, having no combat skills or formal training. However, with years of experience, she developed a fighting style in which she would infuse her psionic energy into her hands to greatly enhance her hand-to-hand combat skills and allow her to parry attacks from bladed weapons without suffering any harm due to her psionic energy protecting her hands from damage. Her combat instincts were also honed to the point she could react to and halt an explosion, parry attacks from Proxima Midnight, and catch Thanos' double-edged sword moments before it could strike her. By the time of the Infinity War, Maximoff had become skilled enough that she was able to engage Proxima Midnight, a combatant deadly enough to overpower Okoye and Black Widow, in close-quarters combat and defend herself adequately, although she was nearly killed several times. After being resurrected, Maximoff, now more powerful than ever and fueled by rage over Vision's death, was able to face Thanos directly in close range combat, managing to subdue and very nearly kill him, had it not been for his desperate air strike that knocked her back.
Spy: Given that she was on the run from the government like her teammates, Maximoff was taught strategies to hide in plain sight by Black Widow, such as masking her thick Eastern European accent with an American one.
Musician: Maximoff plays the acoustic guitar, as evidenced by the presence of one in her room at the New Avengers Facility. As evidenced by the ukulele in the Vision Residence, Maximoff also plays the ukulele.
Multilingualism: Maximoff is fluent in her native Sokovian and English. She initially spoke English with a heavy Sokovian accent, and although it had slightly faded by the time of the attack on the IFID Headquarters, Black Widow taught her how to speak with a convincing American accent by the time of the Attack on Vision. Despite years without speaking her native language or even English with a Sokovian accent, Maximoff was still able to sing a Sokovian lullaby to her twin sons. Her accent resurfaced when she confronted S.W.O.R.D. outside of Westview. Maximoff could also speak some Spanish.
Equipment
Uniform
Sokovia Uniform: After deciding to fight with the Avengers against Ultron in Sokovia, Maximoff wore her black dress, black leather wristers, and black boots, with knee-high torn stockings, along with her jewelry. She was also given Natasha Romanoff's red leather jacket by her brother to wear over her dress, not actually having an official uniform to wear.
Avengers Uniform: When Maximoff became an official member of the Avengers, she was provided her own uniform. This consisted of a black leather suit with a red corset and a red leather jacket over it that had two strips down the front. The uniform included elbow high black leather fingerless gloves, and tall, heeled boots with red piping on top of them. This uniform would soon be replaced.
Second Avengers Uniform: Not long after joining the Avengers, Maximoff would receive a new uniform, similar to her previous one. This version also contained a black leather suit with a red corset but had an open red leather coat over it instead. The uniform also included red leather fingerless gloves and flare-heeled boots. Maximoff would wear this uniform during the Avengers Civil War and then wear it again during the Infinity War and the Battle of Earth. Later, she wore the outfit during her confrontation with S.W.O.R.D. outside of Westview.
Scarlet Witch Uniform: Maximoff receives the red robes and regalia of the Scarlet Witch upon defeating Agatha Harkness and absorbing her magic. Unlike her other uniforms, she is able to transform it from her civilian clothes and back at will. This consists of a red chestplate with angular faulds extending into an ankle-length skirt, elbow-length red fingerless gloves, black trousers and thigh-high boots, and an intricate red crown. She can also manifest a red hood and cloak in addition to the rest of her uniform.
Other Equipment
Darkhold: Maximoff retrieved the Darkhold from Harkness after defeating her. The Darkhold also prophesized the Scarlet Witch to destroy the world and her being more powerful than the Sorcerer Supreme. After a period of studying it, she was able to refine her magic.
Vehicles
Quinjet: After being rescued by her teammates in Scotland, she was transported in a Quinjet back to the New Avengers Facility. Also, while traveling to Wakanda to try to take the Mind Stone from Vision, Maximoff was transported with her teammates in a Quinjet.
Maximoff exiting her car
Red Buick: In 2023, a few weeks after being restored to life, Maximoff drove her car to S.W.O.R.D. Headquarters and then drove to Westview, New Jersey to her empty house lot. When Maximoff released Chaos Magic making the Hex, her car was changed to fit the reality she chose. After the Hex was gone, Maximoff’s car was left at the empty house lot.
Facilities
HYDRA Research Base: The Maximoff Twins were experimented and housed at the Hydra Research Base, located in Sokovia. Maximoff also was exposed to the Mind Stone here, where she unlocked her latent abilities and saw a glimpse of the Scarlet Witch. Maximoff watched The Brady Bunch to comfort herself here.
Novi Grad Church: The Maximoffs visited the Novi Grad Church when Ultron proposed an alliance for them to defeat the Avengers. Days later, during the Battle of Sokovia, they defended the church alongside the Avengers to prevent Ultron and his sentries from turning the floating Sokovia into an asteroid that could destroy Earth.
Avengers Tower: Following the Battle of Seoul, Maximoff traveled to the Avengers Tower alongside Pietro to warn the Avengers about Ultron's plan. After witnessing the birth of Vision, Maximoff took a red jacket that was given to her by Pietro from the tower in order to prepare for their final battle against Ultron.
New Avengers Facility: The Facility was Maximoff’s first home in the United States of America. In 2015, Maximoff was given a room at the Facility after becoming an Avenger and she trained there. She also fell in love with Vision at the Facility. However in 2016, she was forced to leave the Facility after the Sokovia Accords. In 2018, she returned to the Facility briefly, and in 2023, she saw the ruins of the Facility, causing her to become angry at losing her only home.
Wakanda Medical Center: Maximoff stayed in the Wakanda Medical Center to guard and protect Shuri as she was trying to extract data from the Mind Stone, as instructed by Captain America.
Vision Residence:  Maximoff with her reality breaking, Chaos Magic, manifested a house on a property bought for her by the Vision in Westview, New Jersey. The Vision Residence hosted Vision, Wanda Maximoff, Tommy and Billy Maximoff and Sparky.
Cabin: After leaving Westview, Wanda isolated herself in a cabin situated on the plains next to the mountains, where she learned how to coexist in two forms. While brewing tea, her astral form studied the Darkhold and heard what seemed to be the cries of her children crying out for help.
Prisons
Raft: After the Clash of the Avengers ended, Sam Wilson, Maximoff, Clint Barton, and Scott Lang were captured by Tony Stark's team and imprisoned on the Raft for working outside of the law, Steve Rogers would later break them out.

Trivia
In the comics, Scarlet Witch was a founding member of the Brotherhood of Mutants, being initially identified as a mutant and the biological child of Golden Age superheroes Whizzer and Miss America. Later it was discovered that she was, in fact, the daughter of Magneto and his wife Magda Lehnsherr in Vision and the Scarlet Witch #4 (1983), 19 years after Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver's first appearance. In Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #7 (2014) and then Uncanny Avengers #4 (2015), it is confirmed not only are they not related to Magneto but they are also not mutants, as the High Evolutionary was the one that genetically altered them as infants, giving them their powers, before returning them to their parents, the Maximoffs, whom they briefly believed to be their real parents again. Later on, it was revealed in Scarlet Witch #4 (2016) that Wanda and Pietro were actually the children of Natalya Maximoff, the sister of Django, who was also a witch who went by the moniker of Scarlet Witch. Natalya and Django, in turn, are the children of a man called the Scarlet Warlock, and Django and Marya took in Natalya's twins after the deaths of their own, Ana and Mateo.
Although Maximoff's comic book moniker, Scarlet Witch, was never spoken by anyone during the course of the films, Iron Man did once disparagingly refer to her as a "witch." Elizabeth Olsen stated that WandaVision would explain why Maximoff is called that. In the episode Previously On, Agatha Harkness finally deemed her the Scarlet Witch after discovering that Maximoff is a mythical figure who has the power of chaos magic.
Maximoff's Halloween costume sported in All-New Halloween Spooktacular! is accurately based on her comic-book outfit.
Maximoff's stage name "Glamour" in Don't Touch That Dial is a reference to Glynis Zarkov, a Leonia resident with superpowers, that she hide under the guise of the stage magician "Glamor," alongside her husband Ilya.
In the comics, Wanda married Vision, and had twin sons, Billy and Tommy, with him before their marriage dissolved. Their sons erased from existence, but were reincarnated as Wiccan and Speed.
Wanda is 5'6".
Behind the Scenes
Elizabeth Olsen was uncredited for her appearance in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.
Both Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were originally going to appear in the post-credits scene for Guardians of the Galaxy.
Lindsay Lohan, Sasha Pieterse and Saoirse Ronan were considered for the role of Scarlet Witch before Elizabeth Olsen was cast.
Despite the rights to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch being formerly shared between 20th Century Fox and Marvel Studios, the former owned all rights to Marvel Comics mutants, hence why the MCU incarnations could not legally be identified as mutants until the acquisition of 20th Century Fox by Walt Disney Studios.
Wanda Maximoff speaks with a thick Eastern European accent in Avengers: Age of Ultron, which was toned down in Captain America: Civil War, but has an American accent in Avengers: Infinity War. Joe and Anthony Russo explained that this was a deliberate decision made by the character in-universe to make herself less recognizable and that she learned the skill from Natasha Romanoff.
Elizabeth Olsen and Joss Whedon coined the term "wiggly-woo" for the hand gestures Wanda employs to inflict her powers. Olsen had the assistance of choreographer Jennifer White to plan the movements that would appear on screen.
Olivia Jackson, Sarah Molasky, Jennifer White, C.C. Ice, Hayley Wright and Karin Justman were stunt doubles for Elizabeth Olsen in the role of Scarlet Witch.
Evie Wray, Ashley Lyn Blair and Delly Allen were stand-ins for Elizabeth Olsen in the role of Scarlet Witch.
Laura Waggott was a double for Elizabeth Olsen in the role of Scarlet Witch.
In a behind the scenes featurette of Captain America: Civil War that showcased Vision and Scarlet Witch's relationship, Vision stated that her powers were "to manipulate molecular polarity, allowing her to alter reality." This is a reference to Scarlet Witch's powers in the comics.
Elizabeth Olsen has stated that she does not like her corset due to it revealing too much cleavage, compared to other female characters being covered up.
In an interview with Comicbook.com, Kevin Feige stated that the Scarlet Witch's powers are, in fact, magic: "Her powers, she's never had any training, I'm talking about Scarlet Witch. She never had any training; she's figuring it out. Arguably, you could say that that's why her powers are much more chaotic and much more loose in the way that we showcased those light effects. In [Doctor Strange], some of what you might see today, even the cover of Entertainment Weekly, it's much tighter. It's all about focus. It's all about pulling energies from other dimensions in an organized and purposeful fashion, which is why they can do a lot more than she can in, at least, a much more precise way."
