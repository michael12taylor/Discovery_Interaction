<html><p>Back at the Law Office, Murdock and Foggy Nelson were visited by James Wesley, who asked them to represent his client John Healy, who had just brutally murdered Prohaszka. When Wesley left the office, having insulted Karen Page, Murdock followed him, tracking him by the tick of his watch. Murdock heard Wesley enter a limo, where he spoke to his employer, before being driven away. Murdock considered following him, but had felt a pain in his side and felt blood running from an open wound. Although he showed initial uncertainty towards the case, Murdock decided to take the case in an attempt to learn who was behind the criminal activity in Hell's Kitchen.

Defending John Healy

Meeting him at the 15th Precinct Police Station, Murdock and Foggy Nelson had cross-examined John Healy, who clearly was experienced in court proceedings. They began working out a strategy to get Healy off by claiming self-defense. During the trial, Murdock noticed a female juror's heart begin to beat faster when James Wesley entered. Murdock later found Oscar threatening her and forced him to leave her alone. Murdock later gave a speech during the trial claiming that there was not enough evidence to convict Healy. As the result was being read out, Murdock noticed that another juryman's heart raced as Wesley entered; the jury announced a hung jury, resulting in Healy's freedom.

John Healy's Suicide
Murdock asks John Healy about his employer
Murdock later tracked down and confronted John Healy. The pair began to fight, Healy using objects around him to attack Murdock. After an exhausting fight, Murdock came out as the victor and began questioning Healy on who his employer was. Eventually, Healy told him the name: Wilson Fisk. Healy told Murdock that now that he had revealed his name, he, his family and his friends would all become targets. Seeing no alternative, Healy called Murdock a coward for not killing him before he slammed his own face into an iron spike, killing him instantly. Murdock could only listen in horror.

Pursuing the Russians

Murdock later attacked Anatoly Ranskahov and his men. Although Anatoly escaped with only minor injuries, Murdock was able to throw one of his men out of a window and onto his car. After escaping, Murdock went to Claire Temple to treat his injuries. Later, he received a phone call from Temple just as she was being kidnapped by Russian Mafia. Murdock ran to her aid but was too late. He spoke to Santino who was able to reveal that she had been taken away in a taxi driven by the Russians.

Murdock searches for Claire Temple
Murdock arrived at the taxi's firm where he found Temple being beaten and tortured by the Russians. Murdock switched off the lights in the room and managed to fight off the Russians in the dark and rescued Temple. He took her back to his apartment and tried to comfort her. Temple asked him to feel her heart and tell her how she was feeling; Murdock knew then that she was terribly afraid for her life. However, Temple assured him that he could do something about that fear. Murdock then revealed to her his real first name.

Murdock tending Claire Temple's wound
Murdock tended to Temple's wounds and explained that his other senses, such as balance and direction, were enhanced, allowing him to detect micro-changes in air density, vibrations and temperature, which made his impressionistic radar/sonar-like sense. He asked her to stay at his apartment for her safety and they ended up sharing a kiss. The next night, Murdock followed a taxi carrying a blind man to a warehouse. Once there, he attacked the Russians guarding the man, although the blind man was killed after being shot in the cross-fire, Murdock was able to catch one of the gangsters, Piotr.

Murdock questions a Russian mobster
Now confronting Piotr and closely picked him up while he was on the ground, Murdock tried to learn the location of Vladimir Ranskahov, who Temple had heard about when she was captured, but Piotr begged him not to cut off his head. Confused on the remark of killing him, Murdock asked what Piotr meant for having his head decapitated and was told that everyone knows that the masked man had took the head of Anatoly. Before he could learn any more, Murdock threatens Piotr on the accusation of cutting heads before the police arrived, leading Murdock to make his escape and leaving Piotr to be arrested.

Murdock listening to Elena Cardenas' problem
Back at the office, Murdock began to ask Foggy Nelson and Karen Page whether they had heard about a Russian gangster having his head cut off before they were interrupted by the arrival of Elena Cardenas. Cardenas explained that she needed legal help as her landlord was attempting to kick her out of her property and demolish her home after failing to finish repair work to the property. They agreed to take the case and Murdock told Cardenas that Nelson would speak to her landlord's lawyer while he went to the NYPD. Nelson complained, knowing that the landlord was represented by their former employers Landman and Zack.

Murdock speaking to Brett Mahoney
Murdock arrived at the 15th Precinct Police Station and spoke to Brett Mahoney. Murdock explained the situation to Mahoney and asked to see the complaint files against Armand Tully, who owned Cardenas' home. Mahoney agreed and asked Murdock to wait. While he was waiting, Murdock overheard the questioning of Piotr, the mobster he had attacked the night before. Using his enhanced hearing, Murdock heard Piotr asking for a deal in exchange for information on his employer, Wilson Fisk. However, Christian Blake and Carl Hoffman turned out to be under Fisk's pay and pretended to be attacked by Piotr, killing him before Murdock could do anything.

Murdock speaks to Claire Temple
Knowing that the detectives were working for Fisk, Murdock tracked down and attacked Blake. Blake tried to stick to his story that Piotr had attacked his partner, until Murdock began breaking his arm. Murdock asked him why Fisk had Prohaszka murdered; he refused to answer, so Murdock knocked him out and stole his phone. Murdock later called Temple and had her help him look at the phone. Temple told Murdock the phone had a list of four locations which Murdock recognized the addresses as locations under the control of the Russian Mafia. Murdock went to go after the locations, but Temple told him that she could not fall in love with someone who puts his life in danger.

Final Days of the Russians
Murdock fighting against Vladimir Ranskahov
Murdock traveled to a location from the list on Blake's phone and found a pair of mobsters standing by the door. Murdock began fighting them. During the fight he overheard panic inside the building and knew a bomb was about to be set off. Murdock was shielded by his opponent as the door was blown off towards them as the building exploded, killing the Russians inside. When he awoke, Murdock caught Vladimir Ranskahov attempting to escape the wreckage. He attacked him and knocked him out, but before he could do anything, the police arrived and attempted to arrest him. Murdock was able to fight off the police, who mentioned killing them as they were "told" to leave "no witnesses," meaning that they were corrupt. He was unable to stop Ranskahov from being shot in the side, although he managed to escape with Ranskahov's unconscious body.

Murdock speaking with Vladimir Ranskahov
Murdock carried Ranskahov to an Abandoned Building and began questioning him. Ranskahov claimed that Murdock was responsible for the murder of his brother and that he had been working with Wilson Fisk. Murdock told him that he had been played by Fisk, who was responsible for Anatoly's murder and the destruction of his warehouses. Murdock offered to help him escape from Fisk's men, in exchange for information that would help him make Fisk pay for everything he had done, Ranskahov crudely refused before losing consciousness.

Murdock ready to burn Ranskahov's wound
Knowing that Ranskahov would die without medical attention, Murdock called Claire Temple for assistance. Murdock explained the situation to Temple and asked her to walk him through saving Ranskahov's life, but when he explained who it was they were helping, Temple was furious. Temple agreed to help and asked Murdock to tell her what tools he had available. Murdock used his heightened senses to detect a flare in the warehouse. Under Temple's instruction, Murdock lit the flare and used it to burn Ranskahov's open wound, sealing it. Ranskahov screamed in agony until he lost consciousness again.

Questioning Ranskahov
Murdock questioning Vladimir Ranskahov
Murdock heard Sullivan arriving in the warehouse, after hearing Ranskahov's screams. Murdock attacked him and began questioning him. Murdock realized that the officer was a new cop who had not been paid off by Fisk. Murdock ordered the man to call off backup, but instead, the officer told them that he had been taken hostage. Murdock was unable to knock him out in time to stop him. Murdock tied up the officer before pulling the officer's gun apart and throwing it away. Murdock began questioning Ranskahov again, who asked him about his morals on not killing people but being willing to let people die.

Murdock saves Vladimir Ranskahov's life
Murdock reminded Ranskahov that Fisk had taken down his operation and had enough police in his pocket to ensure that Ranskahov was killed before he could leak information. Ranskahov agreed and told the man about his first encounter with Fisk and how their operation first came about. Murdock learned that Fisk was working with the Chinese. Ranskahov told him there was one name he needed to know, the name of Fisk's money man. When Murdock leaned in to hear it, Ranskahov attacked him, causing them to fall through the floorboards.

Wilson Fisk's Threat
Murdock hears the sounds of a voice on radio
The pair survived the fall and Murdock told him that it was not a smart thing to do. Vladimir Ranskahov then lost consciousness again, and this time, he went into cardiac arrest, before Murdock performed CPR and saved his life. Afterwards Murdock began to look for a way out, finding a sewage manhole cover but finding it was too hard to lift alone. He was interrupted when Wilson Fisk used Sullivan's radio to contact them. Murdock picked up the radio and spoke to his enemy for the first time. Fisk told him that they had a lot in common, but Murdock assured him that they did not and would brought down.

Murdock speaks to Wilson Fisk on the radio
Fisk told Murdock that his part in the drama would end that night, as he would be blamed for the bombings. Fisk had then offered Murdock the chance to kill Ranskahov and go free, noting all of the crimes Ranskahov was guilty of. When Murdock refused, Fisk ordered his men to open fire at the New York City Police Department and release footage of Murdock attacking police. Fisk then hung up his radio contact, believing Murdock to be killed that night. Murdock called Claire Temple to say goodbye and began searching for a way out. However, Ranskahov helped Murdock to show him the way through the sewer.

Murdock leaves Vladimir Ranskahov behind
Once in the sewer, they were attacked by a small team of ESU officers, Murdock was able to beat them but found the wounded Ranskahov had taken one of their guns and was aiming it at him. Ranskahov told him that he planned on staying behind and fighting to the death, as his testimony would not lead to Fisk's arrest and only death would stop Fisk. Murdock insisted that he was not a killer. Ranskahov told him that Fisk would destroy his life and his family. He then told him that Fisk's money man's name was Leland Owlsley. Murdock then escaped as Ranskahov fought until his death.

Discussing the Masked Man
Murdock discusses the Masked Man's actions
In the offices of Nelson and Murdock, Murdock, Foggy Nelson and Karen Page discussed the recent events in Hell's Kitchen, including the footage of the masked man seemingly attacking the New York City Police Department and helping Vladimir Ranskahov during the Bombing of Hell's Kitchen. Nelson had become convinced that the masked man was a terrorist while Page insisted he was not and while Murdock claimed to not have much of an opinion on the matter, he noted that while he was angry about Nelson and Elena Cardenas being hurt, he did not wish to condemn the actions of vigilantes straight away, keeping quiet about his own secret identity.

Reunion with Stick
Murdock confronts Leland Owlsley
Murdock later tracked down and attacked Leland Owlsley who had just had a meeting with Nobu Yoshioka about transporting something secret that night. Murdock pinned Owlsley against his own car and demanded to know for whom he worked; when Owlsley lied and claimed he worked for Silver & Brent, Murdock punched him and explained that he knew he worked for Wilson Fisk and demanded to know what Fisk's upcoming plans were for New York City. Before he could get any more information from him, however, he was distracted by the sound of a man with a stick approaching; Owlsley used this moment to stun Murdock with a taser before escaping.

Murdock is reunited with his mentor Stick
As Murdock lay on the ground and recovered from the shock of the taser, the man with the walking stick revealed himself to be Murdock's own former mentor Stick, who arrived and berated him for being beaten by an old man despite all the training they had done when Murdock was a child. Murdock rose to his feet and questioned what Stick was doing in Hell's Kitchen to which he claimed that he was there to save Murdock and everyone else in New York City from a horrible death, although Murdock remained somewhat skeptical of his true motives for returning to the city and seeking him out.

Murdock speaks to Stick about the Black Sky
Murdock brought Stick back to his apartment, where Stick began to immediately insult his comfortable lifestyle. Murdock argued that Stick was just pissed off he had made something of his life without his help. Stick told him he should abandon his life and live as a warrior, but when he insulted Jack Murdock's legacy, Murdock attacked him but was only able to break his hold. Stick revealed he was there to continue his war by fighting the Japanese and wanted the weapon Nobu Yoshioka was transporting, known as the Black Sky. Murdock agreed to help if Stick promised not to kill anyone.

Attack on Black Sky
Murdock and Stick hunt down Nobu Yoshioka
The pair arrived at the dock that same night and soon discovered Yoshioka and his soldiers moving a Asano Robotics container from a cargo ship. Stick had Murdock identify how many soldiers were there and if they were armed with guns or not, which Murdock quickly confirmed that they were by listening and smelling all the senses around the area. Having worked out the situation, Stick sent Murdock down to the docks in order to silently subdue as many of Yoshioka's guards as he could as swiftly as he could while Stick remained on the rooftop and awaited his signal to move down and join him there.

Murdock fights against Nobu Yoshioka's men
Stick sent Murdock down to fight off Yoshioka's soldiers; he went down and silently knocked out a few of the guards without raising the alarm. When the container was opened, Murdock realized that Black Sky was, in fact, a young child. Sensing that Stick was preparing to shoot the child with an arrow, Murdock then leaped into action and deflected the arrow, alerting the guards to his presence. Yoshioka escaped with Black Sky and Murdock fought off the guards. When the guards were defeated, Murdock realized Stick was gone.

Confrontation with Stick
Murdock fights and eventually defeats Stick
Returning to his apartment, Murdock found Stick waiting for him there. Upon being confronted about lying about what was hidden inside the container, Stick revealed that he had hunted down and murdered the Black Sky. Furious at the realization, Murdock attacked his former mentor; during the fight, most of Murdock's apartment was damaged or destroyed. Stick was able to maintain the upper hand during the majority of their fight as he even began kicking Murdock as he lay wounded on the floor, but in the end, Murdock managed to defeat him. Murdock threw Stick's bag at him and demanded that he leave his home and never return to New York City again.

Murdock considers his relationship with Stick
As Stick collected his belongings and got to his feet, he mockingly claimed that there was hope for Murdock yet to join the Chaste and that it had been nice to catch up with him. Once Stick had gone, Murdock was cleaning up his apartment when he found the bracelet he had made for Stick as a child, which he believed Stick had destroyed when he had left him as a child during their training together. Upon finding his token of his love for his mentor, Murdock sat in silence and tried to consider what Stick's motive's were for tracking him down after so many years being apart.

Exposing Fisk
Meeting Ben Urich
Murdock argues with Foggy Nelson and Karen Page
The next morning, Murdock awoke in his wrecked apartment and went to work. Arriving, Murdock overheard Foggy Nelson and Karen Page discussing their secret investigation of Union Allied Construction. Murdock tried to convince them to leave it alone for their own good, but Page was insistent. They told him they were working with Ben Urich, who would break the story for them. Murdock agreed to help them, as long as they promised, they would bring down Union Allied through the legal system. While they investigated the case, Page told them Detective Christian Blake had just woken up in hospital after being shot.

Murdock speaking to Christian Blake
When Murdock arrived at Blake's hospital ward, he found Carl Hoffman injecting him with poison. Murdock put Hoffman in a chokehold and knocked him out before turning his attention to Blake. He locked the door and informed Blake the poison had already reached his heart; there was nothing anyone could do to save his life. The vigilante told Blake to tell him everything he knew about Wilson Fisk. Once Blake had given him the information he needed, Murdock escaped the room moments before the police kicked down the door and found Blake lying dead.

Murdock secretly encounters Ben Urich
Murdock tracked down Ben Urich, the journalist that Page had been speaking to. Murdock insisted he was not the one responsible for the explosions in Hell's Kitchen and wanted Urich to expose Fisk. Urich was initially unsure about this claim and pressed Murdock for proof, but was unable to provide any. However, Murdock did reveal to Urich the details of Fisk's operation, including Leland Owlsley's involvement and Fisk's part in the murder of Detective Blake. Urich ultimately agreed to write the article. However, Fisk made a public announcement which contradicted everything Urich would have said.

Questioning Morality
Murdock and Paul Lantom discuss the Devil
Considering the recent events, Murdock went to Paul Lantom for counsel and accepted his offer for a latte. Once Lantom had poured his coffee, Murdock asked him if he believed in the Devil and if it walked among them. Lantom told Murdock the tale of a holy man he had met while working overseas; Lantom had witnessed the man and his entire family murdered by a military commander. Lantom claimed that he had seen the Devil in the eyes of the man who had murdered his friend.

Murdock and Ben Urich discuss their case
Murdock arrived back at the offices of Nelson and Murdock to find Ben Urich was having a meeting with Karen Page and Foggy Nelson about what to do about bringing down Fisk. Murdock joined the debate, agreeing with most of Urich's points as they both wanted to keep everyone as safe as possible; they discussed tracking down Armand Tully who was responsible for moving tenants from their homes under Fisk's orders. When Page commented on how "bad ass" the man in the mask was, Murdock could not help but smile, despite Nelson still claiming that the man was a terrorist.

Murdock speaks with Elena Cardenas
As their leads proved more and more fruitless, they were visited by Elena Cardenas, who revealed that Wilson Fisk had doubled the offer to get the tenants to move from their homes. They agreed to refuse the offer and to continue to fight back. After she had gone, however, Murdock argued that it was too dangerous to fight Fisk this way as he was sure to win. He told them to continue digging as he believed they would find some lost document somewhere. Murdock then went out to look for the woman who appeared with Fisk at his press event; Page confirmed which art gallery she worked and Murdock left.

Meeting Wilson Fisk
Murdock and Vanessa Marianna discuss art
Murdock arrived at the Scene Contempo Gallery where he was soon approached by Vanessa Marianna. Murdock jokingly explained the reasons for a blind man looking to purchase art as he claimed his guests would often state his home was a bit stark and he wished to warm it up. Marianna began describing some of the pieces of artwork for Murdock to imagine. He then asked her if she was seeing anyone, claiming to wish to know what a man who won her heart appreciated in art.

Murdock meets Wilson Fisk at the art gallery
Just as they were speaking, Wilson Fisk then arrived in the building; although he had to control his anger, Murdock greeted him warmly. Fisk claimed that if he wished to purchase art, he should buy whatever Marianna suggested; Murdock, however, then reminded him that they should not be speaking as they were on opposing sides of a law case involving Elena Cardenas and Armand Tully. The pair then briefly discussed their own hopes for the future of New York City, with Fisk claiming that its future meant a great deal to him, until Murdock left claiming he needed to consider the cost of the art work.

Murdock seeks guidance from Paul Lantom
Seeking moral guidance, Murdock went to visit Paul Lantom again. Murdock told Lantom that he had been to visit someone close to the devil and had only learned that Fisk now had someone he loved, who loved him. Lantom tried to convince Murdock to leave the judgment to God, as he did not wish for Murdock to commit murder. Murdock and Lantom discussed if it was better to commit murder or allow someone to cause harm without being stopped. Lantom then posed the question if Murdock was struggling that he had to kill the Devil but did not want to, or that he did not have to but wanted to.

Losing Elena Cardenas
Murdock shares a joke with Foggy Nelson
Returning to the Nelson and Murdock Law Office the next morning, Murdock informed Karen Page that he had not gotten the information he had wanted from Marianna while Page revealed that they had identified Stewart Schmidt and Joseph Pike as her attackers from the other night. Foggy Nelson then arrived and changing the subject, presented Murdock with an official sign for Nelson and Murdock that they had designed years earlier when the firm was just a dream of theirs and they shared a laugh as they teased each other. While they were celebrating, however, Page received a call that Elena Cardenas had been murdered.

Murdock learns that Elena Cardenas is dead
They went together to identify the body and Brett Mahoney revealed that a junkie had stabbed Cardenas multiple times while stealing her purse outside her apartment door and she had died at the scene. As Mahoney noted that his mother who had been a friend of Cardenas' had informed him that her family were all dead, Murdock and Nelson promised that they would take charge of all funeral arrangements. While Nelson comforted the heartbroken Page, Murdock stood in silence and gripped his blind stick tighter as he planned his own revenge against those responsible for his friend's senseless murder.

Murdock drinks away his sorrow at Josie's
The group went to Josie's Bar to drown their sorrows with alcohol, with Josie giving them the drinks for free; there they discussed the idea that Cardenas' death was not a random act of violence but a planned assassination. While they were talking, Wilson Fisk appeared on the Television claiming to be mourning Cardenas' death. Murdock and Page then discussed religion where Murdock revealed his own Catholic beliefs and how they helped him cope with emotional pain. Murdock then claimed to have had enough and left the bar to head back home, promising Fisk would get what he deserved.

Hunting the Junkie
Murdock puts down his outfit to seek justice
Returning to his apartment, Murdock pulled out the box containing his black suit and prepared himself to go out into New York City in his search for justice. Pausing for a while to consider what he was willing to do and what it would mean for his own soul, Murdock decided this was the right thing for him to do and, putting on his black suit, Murdock hunted down the junkie who had murdered Elena Cardenas. Finding all those with the Steel Serpent heroin, Murdock demanded to know where the man was who had killed her was living, threatening to break a man's arm.

Murdock confronts Elena Cardenas's killer
Eventually, Murdock's interrogation skills paid off and he found the man who kills Cardenas high on drugs before he violently questioned him, throwing him into broken glass which cut both of his hands. As Junkie Jake claimed not to know the names of the men who hired him, stating he had been taken to Pier 81 Warehouse and given his orders by a man in a suit and that he did not want to commit the murder but he was sick from his need for drugs. Having gained the information he needed, Murdock then ordered the man to go and surrender himself to Brett Mahoney at the police station.

Duel at Pier 81
Murdock is confronted by Nobu Yoshioka
Arriving at the Pier 81 Warehouse, armed with his escrima sticks, Murdock was confronted by Nobu Yoshioka, who was wearing an all red ninja suit. Murdock complimented Yoshioka on his ability to slow his heartbeat and reduce his own body temperature to ensure the encounter was a surprise. Murdock noted he remembered Yoshioka from the sale of the Black Sky which he and Stick had stopped, although Murdock insisted he was not a part of the war between the Chaste and the Hand while Yoshioka noted his displeasure at what had occurred.

Murdock is nearly killed by Nobu Yoshioka
As the two fought a violent battle, Murdock was vastly outmatched and was cut and stabbed repeatedly by Yoshioka's Kyoketsu-Shoge. As it appeared that Murdock would not be able to fight anymore and was close to death, Yoshioka commented that Murdock was a worthy opponent and that he considered it to be an honor to claim his life. Eventually, Murdock, barely able to stand, managed to kick Yoshioka, which caused a damaged fuel tank to leak onto Yoshioka's feet, which got ignited and immolated him when Murdock deflected his blade into a lamp that showered sparks down upon Yoshioka.

Murdock threatens to kill Wilson Fisk
The sparks ignited causing Yoshioka to burst into flames and, despite still attempting to continue the fight, the ninja quickly died from his wounds, falling to the ground as his body continued to burn. However, before he could escape, Murdock was confronted by Wilson Fisk, who was accompanied by James Wesley and one of his guards. Fisk claimed he had used Murdock to murder Yoshioka, although he had wished that they had killed each other as he also wanted Yoshioka dead, and admitted to organizing the death of Elena Cardenas in order to draw him to this location for this final battle.

Murdock is attacked by Wilson Fisk
Murdock told him he would kill him for everything he had done and although his men threatened to shoot Murdock, Fisk confidently ordered them to stand down and invited him to take his shot. As the two began fighting, but the wounded Murdock was no match for Fisk and was brutally beaten. During the fight, he tried to cut Fisk using Yoshioka's Kyoketsu-shoge and learned he was wearing Melvin Potter's body armor within his suit which protected him. This close encounter only enraged Fisk further as he proceeded to violently beat Murdock into submission, smashing his body against a table.

Murdock manages to escape James Wesley
As Murdock lay wounded and the fight finally over as it appeared that the Masked Man had no more energy to defend himself, Fisk noted that he was disappointed at the fight's conclusion before he ordered both James Wesley and Francis to shoot him and put an end to his vigilante activities. Refusing to give up, however, Murdock threw one of his sticks to block Wesley's gun and then managed to dodge the bullets before he leapt from the window into the water and swim back to New York City and to safety before Fisk and his men could find him and finish the job of finally killing him as was planned.

Murdock is discovered by Foggy Nelson
Despite his many life threatening injuries, Murdock eventually made it back to his apartment where he crashed into several items which alerted Foggy Nelson who was at the door. Nelson managed to break inside the apartment to check on his close friend's well being and discovered Murdock stood in the suit before he collapsed from his wounds. As Murdock lay on the ground, he was unmasked by Nelson who first suspected that the Masked Man had kidnapped his friend but then was mortified to discover his friend was actually the vigilante of Hell's Kitchen the whole time without him knowing.

Nelson vs Murdock
Murdock recovers from his injures
Needing some help, Foggy Nelson called Claire Temple who arrived and treated all Murdock's injuries from Nobu Yoshioka's Kyoketsu-Shoge. When he regained consciousness, Murdock found Nelson still in his apartment, furious about having been lied to for all the years of their friendship. Nelson questioned if Murdock was the one responsible for the bombing and shooting police officers. Murdock told him that Fisk was responsible for everything. When Karen Page called Murdock's phone, Nelson turned the phone off. When Page called Nelson, he answered and told her that Murdock was in a car accident. He then demanded that Murdock tell him everything about his abilities and his history.

Murdock tells Foggy Nelson the truth
Murdock told him how he was trained by Stick and how he had been taught to use his blindness as an advantage. Later, Nelson received a call from Brett Mahoney informing him that the junkie who killed Elena Cardenas had seemingly committed suicide by jumping off a roof. Murdock told Nelson that he had never killed anyone but wanted to after Cardenas' death, telling him how he had gone to the warehouse with the intention of killing Wilson Fisk. Murdock then told Nelson how his abilities actually developed as he was a child and how he tried not to become a fighter to make his father proud, but was left with no choice when he heard about a little girl being abused by her father, leading him to attack the father, putting him on the path to wearing the mask. During their continued arguments, Nelson compared Murdock to Fisk and told him he would not have kept this a secret from him before storming out.

Mental and Physical Recovery
Seeking Friendship and Guidance
Murdock is given a balloon
Karen Page arrived the next morning to check on Murdock, believing him to have been in a car accident. Murdock opened a bottle of beer for himself and skirted around the questions Page threw at him. Page started to suspect there was not a car accident and Murdock had endangered himself, making an enemy of Wilson Fisk after meeting Vanessa Marianna. She asked him if someone had broken in and beaten him up and Murdock said nothing. Page then told him that they had discovered that Fisk's mother was still alive and living under the name Marlene Vistain and Fisk had murdered his father as a young boy. Murdock reminded skeptical as he did not believe it would make a difference. Page left after giving Murdock a balloon.

Claire Temple treats Murdock's wounds
When Murdock tried to move too much he pulled out his stitches, so he called Claire Temple, who returned to stitch up is wounds again. They spoke about how Murdock used meditation to help heal his wounds gained from Nobu Yoshioka's Kyoketsu-Shoge. Temple suggested that Murdock should invest in body armor to protect himself. He told her how he had sensed that Wilson Fisk wore a special light body armor. Temple then announced that she was planning on leaving the city for a few months. She told him that she believed he had been killed the night the Russian Mafia members were blown up and they knew that they could only be together if Murdock stopped wearing the mask, which he never would. She left after telling him she would always be there to patch him up and comparing him to a martyr.

Murdock speaks to Paul Lantom
With little confidence, Murdock returned to the church to seek guidance from Paul Lantom. Murdock told him that he did not kill the man he had told him about, but that he had wanted to.  He explained how Claire Temple had told him that if he continued what he was doing, he would end up bloody and alone. Lantom revealed that he knew that Murdock was indeed the man in the mask who was attacking criminals at night, although he did not know how he did it. Murdock asked why God had put the Devil within him and they discussed what the Devil actually represented.

Designing the Red Suit
Murdock meditates inside of his apartment
Murdock returned home and tried to meditate to calm his mind and recover his body, but he continued to suffer from the memories of his violent fights with Nobu Yoshioka and Wilson Fisk. Putting his suit back on, he tracked down and chased Turk Barrett and disarmed him. He threatened that if he went for any of his backup weapons, he would throw him off the roof. Murdock demanded to know where Fisk got his armored suits from. Barrett initially claimed to not know but quickly revealed that it was Melvin Potter when Murdock nearly threw him off the roof.

Murdock arrives in Melvin Potter's Workshop
Arriving at Melvin Potter's Workshop, Murdock explored the Workshop and noticed the designs and blueprints on the tables. Murdock was soon interrupted by the arrival of Melvin Potter, appeared as confused and frightened. Claiming that no one should be there, Potter then attacked Murdock with his brute strength and used various items around the workshop including chains and buzzsaws. Eventually, Murdock managed to overpower Potter with a strangle hold and spoke to him. Murdock quickly realized that Potter was a mentally unstable man who was being forced to work for Wilson Fisk under the threat that his caregiver Betsy Beatty would be killed. Murdock promised he would protect Potter and Beatty if he designed a suit for him.

Murdock silently encounters Foggy Nelson
Murdock arrived back at the Nelson and Murdock Law Office and found Foggy Nelson and Karen Page speaking to each other. After an awkward encounter with Nelson as he was leaving in which neither said a word, Murdock spoke to Page. Page told him that Nelson believed that he was responsible for the death of Elena Cardenas. Page tried to convince Murdock to repair his relationship with his friend. Murdock suspected that Page was hiding something. When he asked if something had happened, she told him that the world had fallen apart.

Bringing Down the Drug Trade
Murdock gets information from Ben Urich
Murdock met with Ben Urich outside his office and asked him for information regarding the heroin he had taken from the junkie who had killed Elena Cardenas. He told Urich that he believed since the Russians had been wiped out, Wilson Fisk would have likely taken over distribution of the heroin and he wanted to disrupt that trade to throw Fisk off balance. When Urich revealed he was working on something he believed could help, Murdock told him to keep his head down, using Anatoly Ranskahov's death as an example. Urich told him about the Chinese drug trade using blind people to deliver the heroin. Urich jokingly told Murdock he needed a new outfit and Murdock assured him he was working on it.

Murdock searches for the blind drug movers
Waiting on the street where Ben Urich told him he had seen the blind men delivering the drugs, Murdock used his heightened hearing. He waited to hear the taps of a cane. Murdock followed a blind woman until she was picked up by a car. Murdock followed the car using the classical music it was playing to keep track of its location, running and using acrobatics to move across rooftops until it stopped outside a warehouse. Murdock listened and memorized the secret knock to gain entry and returned home. While stitching up his wounds again he called Karen Page to tell her he would not be coming into the office as he claimed he was working on something that could help the case.

Murdock attacks the Chinese base
Murdock used the secret knock to gain entry into the Chinese drug den. Once inside, he took out the guards. He noticed that the workers did not take any notice of him, and he realized they all been blinded. He was spotted by the woman in charge, Madame Gao, who ordered the workers to attack him, resulting in them grouping up on him while he said he was trying to help them. Murdock survived the attack, however, and confronted Gao. Gao revealed that all her workers had blinded themselves rather than her blinding them because they had faith in her. When Murdock tried to ask her about Wilson Fisk, she pushed him to the floor and sent him sliding a few feet.

Murdock quickly apprehends Brett Mahoney
When he looked up, Murdock discovered that Gao was nowhere to be seen, much to his confusion. With the building burning down, Murdock ordered one of the guards to help the blind workers escape. Once the police had arrived, Murdock hid away from their observation and moved on from an alleyway. As Murdock was leaving he was confronted by Brett Mahoney who attempted to arrest him. Murdock knocked him down and told him that Christian Blake and Carl Hoffman were dirty cops before escaping.

Murdock opens up to Karen Page
Murdock returned to his office and found Karen Page had locked the door. Page asked him if the company had become three people who never speak to each other. In response Murdock quoted Stick's speech that he should push the people he cared about away, and told her that although he tried to ignore that advice, he clearly had listened to those words and taken them to heart. Murdock told Page that he had a terrible night in which he seen the worst of humanity and learned that he couldn't do what he did alone anymore. As Murdock broke down crying, Page hugged him, telling him that he was not alone and never was.

Personal Loss
Murdock attends to Ben Urich's funeral
After Ben Urich was found murdered in his home, Murdock and Karen Page attended his funeral, led by Father Paul Lantom. He listened as Page spoke to Ben's widow Doris Urich. Lantom approached Murdock to ask how he was holding up after the death of his friend. Murdock told him he felt that it was his fault that Urich had died, as he had not stopped Fisk. Back at the office, Page expressed her anger that Urich's former boss Mitchell Ellison had attended, as she believed he had been taking money from Wilson Fisk. They then discussed Foggy Nelson, who had failed to turn up to the funeral. Page told Murdock she was too afraid to return home in case Fisk ever found out she was with Urich when they spoke to his mother. Murdock swore to protect her.

Murdock speaks to Foggy Nelson
Murdock attempted to question Ben Urich's former boss Mitchell Ellison but failed. While training at Fogwell's Gym, Murdock was visited by Foggy Nelson. When Murdock asked how he had found him, Nelson told him he had always known about the gym but assumed it was something to do with Murdock's father so he had never questioned it. They spoke about Karen Page's reactions to Nelson not attending the funeral and their own relationship. Nelson revealed that he had been working with Marci Stahl, who had been copying files concerning Landman and Zack's dealings with Wilson Fisk and Leland Owlsley, Murdock told him to leave it alone as this is what killed Urich. Nelson desperately tried to convince him not to go after Fisk in the mask again, and to use the law instead. They agreed to work together again.

Defeating Wilson Fisk
Murdock and Nelson speak to Brett Mahoney
The pair met with Brett Mahoney who spoke about the warehouse fire at Madame Gao's base. He told them about his encounter with the masked man and how he was starting to believe that Wilson Fisk was the enemy, mentioning that there was not a single fingerprint at the scene of Ben Urich's death. During their conversation, Murdock overheard two officers talking about hunting down Carl Hoffman. They continued their research back at the Nelson and Murdock offices where Karen Page commented on how nice it was to be back together. They looked through the files given to them by Marci Stahl to try and find anything in the money movements that could lead them to where Leland Owlsley could be keeping Hoffman. Eventually Page worked out that there was a property missing from the record and there was no profit from selling it, meaning it was being hidden from the records.

Murdock finds and threatens Carl Hoffman
Murdock went down to the building and found a team of corrupt police officers had killed Owlsley's guards and were preparing to shoot  Hoffman. Murdock was able to save Hoffman and take out the corrupt officers. He sat opposite Hoffman and convinced him to give evidence against Fisk rather than sit and wait for someone to kill him. He told him to turn himself in to Brett Mahoney and use Nelson and Murdock as his lawyers. Murdock followed him to ensure he did as instructed and watched as Hoffman arrived at the 15th Precinct Police Station and gave himself up to Mahoney. Nelson and Murdock were hired as his lawyers and sat with him as he gave evidence against Fisk, exposing his entire operation and leading to the arrests of Turk Barrett, the corrupt cops, Senator Randolph Cherryh and Fisk himself.

Murdock, Nelson and Page celebrate
With Fisk being taken to prison, Murdock celebrated with Foggy Nelson and Page. They raised their glasses in tribute to everyone Fisk had hurt, including Elena Cardenas and Urich. However, during their celebrations, a news report came on the television showing that the armored van carrying Fisk was being hijacked.  They decided to get home quickly before they became endangered, but Murdock decided to leave them and get his own taxi. Nelson tried to convince him not to endanger himself, but Murdock convinced him that he knew what he was doing. He took a cab to Melvin Potter's Workshop where he collected his new armored suit. Standing on a rooftop, Murdock listened to the police sirens to try and locate Fisk.

Duel of Hell's Kitchen
Daredevil confronts Wilson Fisk
Finding the van transporting Wilson Fisk, Murdock threw one of his batons at the window, causing the driver to crash. Murdock then confronted Fisk and told him that not everyone deserved a happy ending. While Murdock fought his guards, Fisk attempted to escape on foot. After knocking out the guard with his batons, Murdock cornered his enemy. Fisk roared at Daredevil, telling him that he was going to kill him; Murdock repeated what Fisk had told him after his fight with Nobu Yoshioka and confidently told him to take his shot at killing him.

Daredevil almost defeated by Wilson Fisk
The pair engaged in a fierce and brutal fight, where Fisk's own brute strength and determination was equally matched with Murdock's speed and agility. Although Murdock's new armored suit offered extra protection, Fisk was still able to beat him nearly to death by throwing him at walls and hard onto the ground before beating him repeatedly with a metal pole, all the while ranting about how the city did not deserve heroes but deserved people like himself and his father and should be burned to the ground and rebuilt in his image as the people in it were scum who deserved to drown and die.

Daredevil finally knocks out Wilson Fisk
Determined to bring Fisk down once and for all, Murdock disarmed Fisk and used his own batons to beat him into submission, telling him that New York City was his home and he would not allow Fisk to destroy it. Barely able to stand due to the beating he had received, Fisk mocked Murdock's attempts to make a difference to the city all on his own while wearing what he had called a silly little costume. However, Murdock used these insults to fuel his rage and launched himself through the air and, with a final hard punch to the face, Daredevil knocked out Fisk and left him on the ground.

Daredevil helps Brett Mahoney arrest Fisk
However, before Murdock could leave the area without being caught, Brett Mahoney then arrived on the scene and even threatened him, confused by seeing a man in a red suit in the middle of a dark alleyway. Murdock, however, remained perfectly calm despite being threatened and explained the situation to Mahoney, who called the rest of the New York City Police Department to inform them that the fugitive had been found. While Mahoney arrested Fisk, he asked what he should now call Daredevil, who escaped by climbing up various fire escapes to the rooftop.

Daredevil
Protecting New York
Murdock and Karen Page discuss Daredevil
The next morning, Karen Page read the New York Bulletin article regarding Wilson Fisk's arrest at the hands of Daredevil and joked about the name and the costume. Foggy Nelson finished attaching a sign to the outside of the Nelson and Murdock offices. They discussed how long it could take for Fisk to go to trial. Murdock then spoke to Page alone, commenting that there was still something in her voice that told him she was still frightened; she told him that putting Fisk behind bars would not bring back Ben Urich or Elena Cardenas or erase the trauma they had been through. He told her all they could do was move forward.

Daredevil overlooking all of New York City
That same night, Murdock put on his new suit again, overlooking the city. Hearing the screams of a women in danger, Daredevil readied his batons and ran off the roof to save them. During the next few months, Daredevil continued fighting crime, tracking down and ambushed Turk Barrett who had now escaped Seagate Penitentiary. Daredevil also helped Zuly Almeida, a client of Nelson and Murdock, whose husband attempted to kill her. Daredevil brutally assaulted him, which resulted in Almeida sustaining two broken arms and waking up in Metro-General Hospital with a restraining ordered safety pinned to his chest by Murdock himself, ending the abuse.

Guardian Devil
Daredevil looking for a robber in a church
Daredevil chased down four robbers in New York City. He subdued the first one who was about to kill a police officer. The second one, he cornered and brutally beat in the kitchen of a restaurant; the third one, who was interrupted by a man who nearly drove him over and whose car he was about to steal, he knocked out and told the driver to call 9-1-1. The final one took a teenage girl hostage and held himself up in a church.

Daredevil watches criminals being arrested
Daredevil soon tracked the criminal down and cornered him where he threw his billy club in such a way that he managed to knock out all of the lights in the room, causing the criminal to panic. Daredevil then revealed himself in the darkness of the church and, after a brief stand off, he managed to subdue the robber and secure the girl's safety as officers arrived, while Daredevil took his position on the roof of the church where he could not be discovered. As he watched from above, more officers arrived to the scene, Daredevil smiled happily, having now fully immersed himself in his vigilante lifestyle.

The "Devil" Problem
Murdock and Foggy Nelson discuss quitting
The next morning, Murdock and Foggy Nelson walked towards the Nelson and Murdock Law Office together with Nelson telling him about his date the previous night. As the two joked, Nelson noticed blood coming from the back of Murdock's head from his latest outing as Daredevil. While Murdock insisted they didn't have to talk about it, Nelson insisted, and told Murdock that he was having a hard time making excuses for his injuries, and pointed out that he would be arrested, or at the very least, disbarred from practicing law, only for Murdock to claim that Nelson would just continue to run the firm without him if it came to it.
