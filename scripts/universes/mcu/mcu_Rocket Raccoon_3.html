<html><p>Enhanced Senses: Rocket can see, smell, and hear better than any raccoon possible. This potentially helps him detect approaching enemies, as he was able to hear Yondu Ravager Clan footsteps so that he could put on traps for them, as well as using his sense of smell to detect Brahl and another Ravager approaching him while hiding.
Abilities
Rocket aiming Vicki through a door
Expert Marksman: Rocket has a great skill in handling various weapons throughout the Galaxy, with the preference of high-powered artillery. Rocket also has excellent precision, enough to shoot Quill with a non-lethal electrical round with his cannon while the latter was running away. During the flight of Kyln, Rocket destroyed many Hoverbots with a weapon of a Nova Corps soldier. During the escape from the Sovereign's fire, Rocket destroyed many of the Sovereign's drones with the ship's turret. Rocket even shot a Ravager through a door from observing the surveillance screens of the Eclector.
Expert Combatant: Although Rocket may not look like it due to his small size, Rocket has been known to pack a punch. Able to shoot many security hoverbots at the Kyln and help take down the Abilisk using weapons he built, he can also fight with his bare paws. He was also able to easily stun two human-sized Ravagers while jumping onto them and attacking them and was able to knock out one of them by punching him repeatedly in the head.
Master Tactician: Rocket is a brilliant strategist. He is able to formulate strategies of advanced combat and escape, even with minimal resources, and to change them according to the needs of the situation. Rocket already said he fled from twenty two prisons. In the Kyln, Rocket quickly devised a plan to escape using only a power source and security band. On Berhert, he quickly laid out a series of traps for the Ravagers.
Master Engineer: Rocket is highly skilled in handling, modification, and construction of equipment and high-tech weaponry. Rocket was able to modify a power source and security band to break into the control tower of the Kyln, disable the security system, unlock doors, and hijack the security Hoverbots. Using scrap from the Milano, Rocket built several high-powered weapons, including the Hadron Enforcer. Rocket was also given the task of fixing the ship when they crash landed on Berhert. Rocket's engineering skills are comparable to the likes of Tony Stark and Bruce Banner when he helped them in forging a new Infinity Gauntlet, the Nano Gauntlet.
Rocket piloting an M-Ship during a battle
Master Pilot: Rocket is an excellent pilot of various starships. On Knowhere, he took down several Necropods using only the high durability of his industrial pod. During the Battle of Xandar, Rocket was responsible for leading the attack of the Ravagers and Nova Corps, in the Dark Aster, destroying many Necropods in the process. Rocket also proved capable of piloting improvised vehicles, like the Kyln's security tower. Rocket is even said to be a greater pilot than Peter Quill.
Bilingualism: Rocket can speak English and has the ability to understand what Groot is saying, though others; including Star-Lord's Translator Implant only hear "I am Groot."
Equipment
Weapons
Ion Cannon: Rocket's favorite weapon, until he was forced to sell it in The Hub in order to obtain some fast cash.
Gas Grenade: A small device that emits a sleeping gas.
Rocket taking aim with his Laser Cannon
Laser Cannon: Rocket's new weapon, described as "the juiciest killware seen in ages," and obtained in a confiscated weapons case in a customs station in the Hub. He shot at Peter Quill with it to prevent him from escaping in Xandar right before being apprehended by the Nova Corps, and threatened Drax with it in Knowhere. He incapacitated Gamora right before escaping from the destruction of Ego, to prevent her from sacrificing herself in an attempt to rescue Quill from there.
Nova Machine Gun: Rocket used this gun after Drax tossed it to him in order to destroy the Kyln Hoverbots during their breakout.
Hadron Enforcer: One of Rocket's own inventions, it is a large combustion cannon used for demolition purposes and stated to be able to destroy moons, and used by Rocket to destroy Ronan the Accuser's hammer.
Power Stone: During their final battle with Ronan the Accuser, Rocket and the other Guardians of the Galaxy used the Power Stone in tandem to direct the Stone's energy at Ronan, destroying his body and killing him.
Gatling Blaster: Rocket chose a heavy weapon to fight the Abilisk, firing against it while flying around the beast. Once Star-Lord realized the beast had a wound on the neck, both started to shoot him from above to give a chance to Gamora to kill it by attacking the wound.
Rocket with Katie and Vicki
Katie and Vicki: Rocket confiscated two blasters from the Eclector. He shot a Ravager through a door with Vicki, using a camera to aim, and continued to fire off shots with both Katie and Vicki.
Mini Bombs and Bubble Shield: As he was surrounded by Ego's energy tentacles, Rocket launched a small amount of Mini Bombs to the tentacles, and then activated the Bubble Shield, detonating the explosives and destroying the wave of constructs.
Collapsible Blaster Rifle: Rocket armed himself with this weapon in order to hold Ego off and buy some time for Groot to detonate a bomb in its core. His gun successfully destroyed many of Ego's energy tentacles until he was overwhelmed by them.
Twin Barrel Blaster: Rocket engaged the Outriders as soon as he arrived on Wakanda, shooting at many of them. When surrounder, he was picked up by Bucky Barnes and spun into a circle, firing his weapon at the same time as Barnes shot with his own, killing the wave of Outriders.
Rocket fighting alongside Barnes
Dual Blasters: Rocket carried his dual blasters in two holsters in his legs. He prepared one of them while riding War Machine to join the forces of the Avengers against Thanos and his army, but soon he went to the ground and duel-wielded his two guns. He fought alongside Bucky Barnes again, killing one of the Chitauri waves, and shot one last time to a fast approaching Leviathan, only for it to disintegrate before being hit.
Other Equipment
Aero-Rigs: Another invention of Rocket is jet-pack devices that are materialized onto the user and allow them to seamlessly fly through the air and potentially even reach space.
Anulax Batteries: Anulax Batteries are powerful energy sources that serve as the main provenance for the Sovereign and its people. Rocket stole several of these in his battle with an Abilisk. During the Battle on Ego's Planet, Rocket used the batteries to create a bomb to kill Ego.
Nanobot Welder: A highly-technological device that can create or repair space vessels using nanotechnology.
Advanced Tech Suit: This suit was designed in order to time travel through the Quantum Realm safely. It is a white, red and black suit that materialize around the wearer's regular clothes, managing to be summoned when time travel is required again, and disappear when no longer in use. It has size-shifting adaptability down to subatomic levels and a wrist gadget that allows for displacement through time and space.
Aether Extractor: A device capable to extract the Aether from its hosts.
Vehicles
Milano: When Rocket joined forces with Peter Quill to escape from the Kyln, Quill directed him to his ship and told him to fly it outside the prison. Then, when the Guardians of the Galaxy were formed, Rocket would co-pilot the ship with Quill, although they would often fight for control. This would eventually lead Rocket to crashing the Milano on Berhert.
Mining Pod: When the Guardians of the Galaxy were attacked by Ronan the Accuser on Knowhere, Rocket, along with Peter Quill and Gamora piloted Mining Pods to escape from them. They then started using them offensively to destroy some Necrocraft ships.
Eclector: The Guardians of the Galaxy were brought onboard Yondu's Ravager Clan's ship, where they created a plan to fight Ronan the Accuser and his forces. When Rocket and Groot were captured by Yondu's Ravager Clan, they were taken to their ship and locked up to be given to the Kree. However, Rocket teamed up with Yondu Udonta and escaped from, as well as destroying, the ship.
Quadrant: Rocket flew this ship after escaping from the Eclector to rescue his team on Ego. However, he made the ship do seven hundred jumps. The Guardians used this ship as their new ship temporarily afterwards.

Warbird: During the Battle of Xandar, Rocket used this ship to fight Ronan the Accuser and his forces. The ship got destroyed when Rocket flew the ship into the Dark Aster.
Dark Aster: To be added
Laser Drill: To rescue the Guardians of the Galaxy on Ego, Rocket and Yondu Udonta used this ship to cut through Ego's surface to his core. There, Rocket used the laser drill to destroy Ego's core, but the ship was damaged and then destroyed.
Benatar: After crashing the Milano, the Guardians of the Galaxy acquired a new ship, as their new base of operations and home. Rocket and Peter Quill were piloting the ship when they came across Thor. Rocket was reunited with the ship when Captain Marvel carried it to Earth, and she and Rocket piloted the ship to ambush Thanos. Rocket would continue to use the ship with Nebula when serving as a member of the Avengers. Rocket was eventually reunited with his team and returned to how things used to be, now with Thor joining the team.
Benatar's Space Pod: Rocket used the Benatar's space pod, while bringing Thor and Groot, to travel all the way to Nidavellir to make a weapon that would kill Thanos. While there, Rocket used the space pod to help Thor create Stormbreaker outside of Nidavellir.

Trivia
In Avengers: Endgame, Rocket wears a uniform that looks like his classic uniform from the comics.
Rocket is the only member of the Guardians of the Galaxy to have never died in some form at least once.
Rocket claims that his lifespan is the normal lifespan for a raccoon, i.e. at most 20 earthly years. However, this is inevitably incorrect, as even if he was abducted as a newborn, he has spent at least several years in captivity, later has been a criminal for at least several more years, and is one of the Guardians of the Galaxy for nearly a decade now, making him at least 20 earthly years old. Thus, his lifespan was likely enhanced as well by the experiment that "made" him.
In a deleted concept, a variant of Rocket Raccoon was supposed to make an appearance in the first episode of Loki.
Behind the Scenes
Before Bradley Cooper was cast as Rocket Raccoon, Adam Sandler, David Tennant, Sharlto Copley, Jim Carrey, Danny DeVito and H. Jon Benjamin were considered for the role.
Rocket Raccoon was not included in early drafts of the Guardians of the Galaxy script out of fear that he would be considered too cartoonish.
Bradley Cooper took inspiration from actor Joe Pesci in his portrayal of Rocket.
