<html><p>Sinara was a cold-hearted and driven killer. She was a woman of action, never saying more than absolutely needed, to which she almost never spoke and even then was always to the point. Like the rest of the Kree, she had little regard for feelings such as compassion, speaking the word in a tone of contempt when describing Jemma Simmons. She also tented to display sadistic traits, often grinning at the perspective of killing others or making them suffer. Sinara also proved to be quite perceptive, as she did not believe that Daisy Johnson and Simmons were the only S.H.I.E.L.D. agents from the past despite Ben's assurance and remained convinced that there were more, just like she perceived that Boshtok the Marauder should not be trusted by Kasius.

Sinara was shown to be very loyal and have romantic feelings for Kasius, becoming very close to him in the past after saving Kasius from two Kree generals, who in return saved her by concealing her crimes. However, she did seem to question her loyalties after Kasius ordered her to fight Quake to death. In order to prove Kasius' loyalty and feelings for her, she murdered Maston-Dar in cold blood, causing Faulnak to desire her as his new warrior in his place, in turn causing Kasius to murder his own brother to defend her.

Abilities
Expert Combatant: Sinara often used her Kree Spheres to defeat or subdue opponents. However, when deprived of them, she was able to attack combatants with hand-to-hand combat to great effect, as demonstrated when she engaged Quake in a death match. She was also able to defeat Melinda May, although it should be noted that the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent suffered from a heavy wound in the leg.

Equipment
Weapons
Kree Spheres:     Sinara arming herself with her Kree Spheres  Sinara was often armed with two silver spheres, which she was able to remotely control in the air and make them penetrate forcefully into her victims' bodies. She used them both in real combat, such as against Melinda May and Daisy Johnson, as well as to execute her victims, which was often under the direct command of Kasius, as she did with Reese, Ben and Maston-Dar. Since the deadly force of her weapons were known to her enemies, Sinara would often just hold the spheres in her hands, threatening to use them against anyone who went against Kasius' wishes.

Twin Kree Blades: During her duel against Daisy Johnson, Sinara wielded a Kree blade and attempted to stab Johnson, despite being ordered not to kill her, but she was stopped and briefly disarmed by Deke Shaw, with the use of the Grappling Claw.
Other Equipment
Silencing Implant: Sinara was given control over Jemma Simmons' implant, allowing her to have power over when Simmons could hear anything other than Kasius' voice. Sinara only turned off this implant when she and Tye needed Simmons to assist them with gaining control over Abby's Inhuman powers.
