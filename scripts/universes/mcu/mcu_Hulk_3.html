<html><p>Although Thor attempted to convince Hulk that everybody loved him since he was a member of the Avengers, Hulk insisted that Thor was only friends with Bruce Banner, which Thor denied by claiming that he did not even like Banner. Hulk still refused and Thor made his way out while insulting the room. However, Thor was electrified by the door and Hulk laughed hysterically at him.

Hulk goes to training with Valkyrie
Hulk puts back on his Sakaaran Battle Armor and tells Thor that he goes under training with Valkyrie for his next fight with the Contest of Champions. As Hulk reaches the door Valkyrie asked him how he was doing to which he replies that he has been winning the tournament. Once he was alone, Thor had meditated and attempted to come into contact with Heimdall back on Asgard.

Hulk prepares to throw weapons at Thor
At night, Thor attempted to rip out of his Obedience Disk out of his neck once again to which he had no luck as it had instead caused him considerable pain. Waking up in his bed and seeing this, Hulk noted how sad Thor looked, to which Thor simply told him to shut up as he sat alone and contemplating his next move. Hulk pushed him over and still continued teasing him, the annoyed Thor rebutted that he was furious to what had happened to his home, the death of father and losing his hammer before he had become imprisoned by the Grandmaster.

Hulk catches up and jokes around with Thor
Hulk decided to ignore and irritated with Thor's complaints, Thor furiously accused him of not listening and began kicking some stuff towards Hulk. Hulk furiously told Thor to stop kicking stuff, to which Thor responded by claiming that Hulk was known as the stupid member of the Avengers, as Hulk called Thor the tiny Avenger. As his temper rose, Hulk threw a shield at Thor which nearly decapitated him, resulting in Thor angrily claiming that everybody on the Earth hates Hulk. Eventually, they managed to reach a cordial ground and Thor convinced Hulk to call on his sparring partner, Valkyrie to his room.

Return to Banner
Hulk welcomes back Valkyrie into his room
The next day, Hulk did as Thor requested and had Valkyrie come up to his chamber, as together they playfully sparring with each other as Hulk played with the Sakaaran War Hammer while Valkyrie kicked him over. Thor then revealed himself in the room, awkwardly trying to look impressive before Valkyrie simply ignored him and prepared to leave the room, as she claimed that Thor was too thick headed to see she was in Sakaar only to hide away from her problems.

Hulk begs Thor to stay on Sakaar
As Valkyrie was about to leave, Hulk threw part of his bed to ensure she did not leave. Valkyrie agreed to listen to Thor, as the two conversed about the threat of Hela would bring to Asgard. Though unsuccessful in bringing Valkyrie over to his side, Thor managed to get the remote for his Obedience Disk and took the implant off. With that, Thor took a ball that Hulk was playing with and used it to crack the room's glass window, although this resulted in the ball bouncing back and striking Thor's face. Getting back onto his feet, Thor immediately made his escape toward the Quinjet. Hulk was distraught at leaving him behind and preceded to follow him.

Hulk transforms back into Bruce Banner
As soon as Thor could take off and escape from Sakaar, Hulk immediately tried to stop him from leaving, damaging the Quinjet in the process. During his attempt, Thor turned on Natasha Romanoff's recording back during the Battle of Sokovia. Seeing her, Banner was able to awaken and transform back into himself, despite Hulk's attempts to prevent it from happening. Confused by his surroundings, Banner was confronted by Thor and was told to calm down.

Hunted by the Grandmaster
Banner talks to Thor about his absence
Returning back to his senses, Banner found himself in the Quinjet and met with Thor. He quickly asked what happened to Ultron and Sokovia. Banner was shocked to be informed that while they won the fight, that event happened two years ago. With no memories of what happened in the past two years, it dawned to Banner that his relation with Hulk is starting to change; he compared it to previously both of them having a hand on the wheel, but this time it was like Hulk stuffed him in the trunk. Banner voiced his fear to Thor that if he ever transformed back to Hulk again, he might not be able to come back.

Banner angrily speaks to Thor about disguising
They did not have long to catch up. Soon they heard an announcement from the Grandmaster that they are hunting Thor, due to believing that Thor has captured Hulk. Much to Banner's annoyance, Thor forced him to wear the only available clothes in the Quinjet; they belonged to Tony Stark, which were a tight fit for Banner. The two former Avengers made their escape from the Quinjet and start making their way through the city.

Banner stranded on Sakaar
Though Thor attempted to keep Banner calm, he only succeeded in agitating Banner even further. The two discussed leaving Sakaar and fighting Hela; however, Banner made it very clear he was tired of fighting evil beings and only wanted to go back to Earth to be left in peace, and felt Thor was only using him to get to Hulk. However, Banner agrees to accompany Thor back to Asgard on the condition that he doesn't have to think about Hulk ever again.

Banner with Valkyrie and Thor
Eventually, amidst a Hulk parade, they encountered Valkyrie. She has decided to join Thor in his fight against Hela. She brought them to her apartment, where she has chained and captured Loki, much to Banner's surprise. Banner then reminded Loki of how they had last seen each other during the Chitauri Invasion, as Loki then calmly threatened him. Banner, Thor, and Valkyrie then discussed how to leave Sakaar and return back to Asgard. They decided to steal the Grandmaster's ship and escape through the biggest portal of Sakaar. Banner and Valkyrie remarked that they seemed familiar to one another. However, Thor dismissed this and hid Banner's link to Hulk from her in case she changed her mind about helping them to take Hulk back to the Grandmaster.

Escape from Sakaar
Banner pilots the Commodore
Banner stayed with Valkyrie while Thor and Loki went to steal the Commodore which belonged to the Grandmaster. During their escape, Thor forced Banner to steer the ship while he assisted Valkyrie with fighting off their pursuers. Banner unwittingly made Topaz crash into a rock when he turned on the ship's fireworks in his attempts to assist his allies. Banner handed the control to Valkyrie and traveled with his allies to Asgard.

Turning Back Into Hulk
Banner contemplates turning into Hulk
Banner, Thor, and Valkyrie arrived on Asgard, onboard the Commodore. Horrified by the destruction Hela and her resurrected Berserkers caused to the civilization, Banner commented that Asgard was not in good condition and would have looked nicer if it had not been in flames. Thor informed them that while he's dealing with Hela, he needs Banner and Valkyrie to help evacuate the Asgardians. When Banner asked how they were supposed to do that, Thor informed him that he already had someone on the ground protecting the Asgardians. Banner stayed with Valkyrie to prepare and assist the remaining Asgardians with the evacuation while Thor headed back to the throne room to confront Hela. They immediately went to the Rainbow Bridge to assist the Asgardians.

Banner lands on the Rainbow Bridge
When they arrived, they found Heimdall and the rest of the Asgardians trapped by Fenris, who was charging towards them. Valkyrie then proceeded to shoot at the gargantuan wolf, only for the creature to absorb the bullets. Having discerned that the bullets caused no harm to the wolf and witnessing Skurge and Hela's forces attacking them from behind, Banner decided to turn back into Hulk in order to prevent the Asgardians from getting slaughtered, despite knowing that he might not be able to turn back into himself. Banner then jumped off the ship, landing in front of Heimdall and the rest of the Asgardians and injuring himself at first. Fenris tries to sniff out Banner to see if he's alive.

Hulk returns to fight and confronts Fenris
Showing no signs of it, the wolf continued charging towards the Asgardians. As she lunges towards the Asgardians, preparing to attack, Banner transforms into Hulk and drags her back by her tail to prevent her from attacking. Hulk resumed control and confronted the wolf on the Rainbow Bridge. They then began to fight, with Fenris charging towards Hulk, attempting to devour him but it only succeeds in tossing them both into the river below, where they continued to battle.

Hulk continues battling against Fenris
Hulk continued to battle against Fenris until Loki arrived onboard the Statesman to help evacuate the remaining Asgardians before they could all be wiped out, during which he is seen keeping Fenris's massive jaws open as she tries to devour him again. Eventually, he is snatched in her jaws and throttled around like a chew toy as he is dunked into the water, where she bites painfully into his highly impervious skin, causing Hulk to bleed. However, Hulk manages to defeat Fenris by throwing the wolf off the edge of the sea and into the void.

Hulk attacks Surtur
Hulk then got back on the Rainbow Bridge and saw Surtur destroying Asgard. In an effort to stop him, Hulk immediately charged into battle and jumped onto Surtur's face, where he immediately began punching at the Fire Demon. Despite throwing punches at him, Hulk was thrown back onto the bridge. Before he could resume his battle, Thor shouted at Hulk to stop and don't smash, but Hulk wanted to fight Surtur. However, Valkyrie convinced Hulk to stand down as they wanted Surtur to destroy Asgard so that Hela could be killed. Hulk reluctantly agreed and carried Thor and Valkyrie onto the Statesman, which was being commandeered by Loki and Korg.

Joining Thor
Hulk joins Thor on his trip towards Earth
Hulk boarded up inside the Statesman with the rest of the Asgardians and alongside his allies. He then watched as Surtur fulfilled the prophecy and destroyed Asgard. In a brief coronation, Hulk, along with Loki, Heimdall, Valkyrie, Korg, and Miek, and the rest of the Asgardians, witness Thor officially becoming the new King of Asgard as he sits on his throne. Hulk then joined Thor on their trip after the Asgardian had decided to lead the remaining Asgardians to Earth. Hulk spent months onboard the ship while Banner was still inside Hulk's mind. On their way to Earth, they were intercepted by the Sanctuary II, a vessel commanded by the warlord Thanos.

Infinity War
Attack on the Statesman
Hulk confronts and fights Thanos
Thanos and the Black Order attacked the Statesman and killed half of the ship's population so they could take the Tesseract and the Space Stone within, while Valkyrie was able to lead the other half to the escape pods, along with Korg and Miek. Hulk, however, remained behind along with Thor, Loki, and Heimdall to fight the invaders. After they killed or otherwise subdued most of the Asgardians on board, Hulk remained in hiding while Thanos tortured Thor in order to make Loki give him the Tesseract.

Hulk getting beaten down by Thanos
However, instead of giving him the Tesseract, Loki revealed that he had a Hulk on their side. This remark signaled the Avenger to immediately spring from hiding and attack Thanos, tackling him to the ground before he could retrieve the Tesseract. However, once he had Thanos pinned into a wall, he soon found the Titan's strength to be superior to his own, and his grip on Thanos was quickly overcome and he was subsequently punched by Thanos in the face with enough force to briefly daze him.

Hulk is utterly beaten by Thanos
Hulk then attempted to strike back, but to his complete surprise, Thanos displayed a vast superiority and proceeded to block all of Hulk's blows and punches, leaving Hulk completely stunned about being so vastly overpowered. Finally, Hulk was punched in the face by Thanos’ knee which left him completely dazed before he was lifted into the air and thrown onto the ground by Thanos and was beaten within an inch of his life.

Hulk is saved by Heimdall
However, Hulk was then saved by a badly injured Heimdall, who used the last of his power to master enough dark magic to conjure a Bifrost Bridge, which sent Hulk away from the battle and to the New York Sanctum on Earth. Thanos killed Heimdall and Loki and destroyed the ship, seemingly killing the rest of those on board, including Thor.

Crashing to Earth
Banner warns the arrival of Thanos
Traveling to Earth, Hulk crashed through the roof of the New York Sanctum in New York City, creating a massive crater in the building's staircase. As Doctor Strange and Wong investigated, they found Hulk reverting to the form of Bruce Banner, warning them that Thanos was coming. Shocked, Strange asked Banner who Thanos was, but Banner insisted on contacting Tony Stark first. Doctor Strange summoned a portal to Stark, and Banner was reunited with Tony and Pepper Potts.

Banner tells Stark about Thanos
Back in the Sanctum, Wong and Strange explained the Infinity Stones to Stark and Banner. Upon Banner once again telling Thanos' name to Stark, he revealed that he is the mastermind of the Chitauri Invasion from some years ago, referring to the attack on New York as Thanos' doing instead of Loki's, due to coming to terms with the God of Mischief. Banner then informed Stark that Thanos has the Space and Power Stones.

Banner tells Tony Stark to call Steve Rogers
When Strange and Stark argued over what to do with Strange's Time Stone, Banner quickly stopped their bickering, stating that they must find Vision to protect his Mind Stone, only for Stark to reveal that he is off the grid. When Stark suggests that Steve Rogers could find him, Banner told Stark to call Rogers. However, Stark revealed that the Avengers had separated after a fight between Stark and Rogers. However, Banner convinced Stark to call Rogers by telling him that Thanos had killed their teammate Thor and told him that what happened during the Avengers Civil War is nothing compared to Thanos.

Attack on Greenwich Village
Banner confronts Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian
However, just before Stark could make the call, Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian arrived to secure the Time Stone from Doctor Strange. Leaving the Sanctum, to investigate, they found people fleeing and screaming in panic, as a Q-Ship sent by Thanos had arrived.

Banner tries to turn into Hulk
Outside the Sanctum, the Q-Ship was confronted by Bruce Banner, Tony Stark, Doctor Strange, and Wong. In the confrontation, Banner tried to turn into Hulk, which embarassed Stark in front of Strange and Wong. Hulk, however, refused to come out, forcing Stark to use his new armor which generated repulsors out of nothing to blast Obsidian. A shocked Banner asked where they came from, with Stark revealing the armor to be made of nanotechnology.

Banner continuously fails to turn into Hulk
While Iron Man went to fight Obsidian, Strange teleported Banner away to the nearby Washington Square Park for his own safety. When Stark himself ended up in the park Banner was sent to, he asked about the conflict, only for Stark to remark that it was getting worse. Stark then asked Banner if he could help, only for Banner to notify that he was trying but Hulk wouldn't come out.

Banner witnesses Wong severe Obsidian's left arm
While Stark continued to protect Banner by fighting Cull Obsidian, Banner then tried to call Hulk again, only for Hulk to directly refuse his orders, due to Hulk's trauma at his defeat at the hands of Thanos as well as anger over being feared and hated and used as a tool. Banner then watched as Stark and Spider-Man fought Obsidian as the battle continued. When Stark was about to be killed by Obsidian's hammer, he saved by Wong, who transported the alien to Antarctica.

Banner comes into contact with Steve Rogers
Before Obsidian could escape through the portal, Wong closed it, severing the former's left arm, causing Banner to kick it aside. Once Ebony Maw left with a captive Doctor Strange, Banner managed to find the discarded burned phone that was left for Stark by Steve Rogers. He then watched Wong leave to secure the New York Sanctum, before contacting Rogers to notify him of the coming threat on Vision's life.

Reunion with Avengers
Banner reunites with his Avengers teammates
Banner reunited with his former Avengers teammates at the New Avengers Facility, including an awkward greeting with Natasha Romanoff, who had returned from saving Vision and Scarlet Witch in Scotland. Now reunited with most of the Avengers, Banner asked where Hawkeye was, knowing that they must need all the help possible, only to be told that he is on house arrest along with Scott, whom Rogers revealed to be Ant-Man, which surprised Banner when he learned that there was an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man.

Banner speaks about what to do with Thanos
Upon resuming their conversation, the team would decide on what to do with Vision, who suggested to destroy the stone even if it would kill him. Unwilling to kill their friend, Banner proposed the difficult task of removing the Stone from Vision to safely destroy it without needlessly taking Vision's life. Rogers suggested taking Vision to Wakanda, the only nation on Earth with the resources capable of achieving this.

Battle of Wakanda
Banner wears a Hulkbuster armor for the Battle of Wakanda
The Avengers took Vision to the lab of Shuri, who worked with Banner to find a way to remove the Stone from Vision. The Black Order then arrives in Wakanda to get the stone. In order to stop them, the Avengers got the Hulkbuster armor for Banner, who managed to pilot it successfully until he hit a rock and nearly fell.

Banner runs into battle to fight multiple Outriders
Banner would help in the Hulkbuster armor by firing repulsor blasts at the Outriders. However, Banner noticed that the limited success of the direct forward assault caused the Outriders to begin to circle the barrier to flank the armies instead. He told Rogers that if the Outriders breach the barrier behind them, they had a clear path to the vulnerable Vision in Shuri's Lab.

Banner hails Thor's arrival
During the battle, Banner, Barnes, T'Challa and Rogers were mobbed and forced to the ground by sheer numbers of Outriders. However, they were suddenly wiped out when the Bifrost Bridge beamed down from the sky into the center of the battlefield. Thor, armed with Stormbreaker, Rocket Raccoon and Groot stepped out of the Bridge into the battlefield confronting the Outrider armies, with Banner happy to see that his friend survived the attack on the Statesman.

Banner fighting Cull Obsidian while inside the Hulkbuster
Later, Vision would get attacked by Corvus Glaive with Banner quickly arriving to assist against Cull Obsidian and Glaive. Banner engaged in a ferocious duel with Obsidian. Falling into a nearby waterfall, Banner called for reinforcements to stop Glaive as he fought. However, Obsidian began to gain the upper hand, severing the Hulkbuster's left arm. In response, Banner attempted to bring out Hulk to turn the tables, to no avail.

Thanos' Victory
Banner is trapped by Thanos
Frustrated, Banner resolved to handle Cull Obsidian himself, managing to trap the latter's arm in the severed Hulkbuster arm. Activating the arm's repulsor thrusters, Banner sent Obsidian flying into the Wakandan energy barrier, where he violently exploded. After the Black Order and the Outriders were defeated, Thanos arrived in Wakanda where Banner confirmed his identity. Thanos began slowly advancing towards Vision and Banner made the first strike, only for Thanos to phase Banner out of space using the Space Stone.

Banner distraught after the Snap
When Thanos snapped his fingers upon completing the Infinity Gauntlet, half of the universe was disintegrated into ash, leaving Banner as one of the survivors with Steve Rogers, James Rhodes, Natasha Romanoff, Thor, Rocket Raccoon, M'Baku, and Okoye, having his head exited out of the Hulkbuster Armor and bowing his head in despair over their defeat.

Meeting Captain Marvel
Banner observes the Transmitter Pager
Following the Battle of Wakanda, Banner, along with Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes, returned to the New Avengers Facility. Having discovered the Transmitter Pager Nick Fury had activated prior to his disappearance, Banner and Rhodes bypassed the pager's battery in order for it to continue to send out its signal. As Rogers and Romanoff were witnessing reports on the aftermath of the Snap, Rhodes, who was monitoring the pager, informed the pair and Banner that the pager had stopped transmitting the signal. 

Rogers requested that they reboot the pager and resend the signal, only for Banner to respond that they had no idea what the signal was for. As Romanoff explained that Fury knew whom the signal was for and that she wanted to know who it was as well, she came face to face with Captain Marvel herself, who demanded to know where Fury was.

Plan Discussion
Banner witnesses the return of Tony Stark
Some time later, Captain Marvel brought back Tony Stark and Nebula safely from outer space by carrying the Benatar to the New Avengers Facility. After reuniting with the rest of team, Rogers asked Stark about Thanos' location, angering Stark who began to rant at him, blaming him for rejecting Ultron and how that left them unable to prevent and stop cosmic level threats like Thanos. During the discussion, Stark collapsed and Banner gave him a sedative to put him out for a while so he can recover properly.

Banner discusses facing Thanos again
Returning to the topic of Thanos, Danvers decides to go to find Thanos herself until Nebula says she knows where he is. Rocket then informs the rest that two days ago, the same energy signature of the Snap was detected in a certain planet and they all conclude the Mad Titan is there. Danvers proposed to got after him and get the stones to reverse the Snap, but Banner was very concerned about their numbers and the high chances of failing again. However, Danvers convinced them that with her they were more than enough.

Ambush on Thanos
Banner arrives at the Garden
Excluding Iron Man, Banner, the remaining Avengers as well as Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain Marvel suited up and boarded the Benatar. Banner sat up front with Nebula while they headed to the Garden, the planet where Thanos resided. When they arrived, Captain Marvel did a recon. When she returned, she informed them that it was only Thanos on the planet, to which Nebula stated was enough.

Banner manages to hold down Thanos
They then ambushed the Titan at his own house, with Captain Marvel placing him in a headlock, Banner piloting the Hulkbuster quickly joined her by bursting out from the floor of Thanos' campfire and restraining the Titan's arm, with War Machine joining him by holding Thanos' other arm. Thor then arrived and chopped his Infinity Gauntlet arm off. The others then entered the hut, only to realize the Infinity Stones were gone. They then demanded Thanos to tell them where the stones were located, but they learned by word that he used the very stones to destroy the stones.

Banner pushes Thanos in anger
Banner then pushed him in anger and yelled at Thanos for murdering trillions of lives and shoved him onto the ground. Thanos stated that he should be grateful, but Banner punched him in the face. They initially believed Thanos to be lying, but Nebula stated that while Thanos was many things, he was not a liar. Banner could only watch in horror as Thor decapitated Thanos. Once they realized they could never use the stones again, the Avengers return to Earth in defeat.

Merging with Hulk
Eighteen Month Experiment
Between 2018 and 2023, Banner began to re-evaluate himself and Hulk. Tired of viewing Hulk as a problem in his life, Banner chose to see Hulk as "the cure" to the disease of his inner discontent, restarting his research into gamma radiation for an 18-month experiment. Banner's research allowed him to merge his intelligence with Hulk's physical appearance and powers into one being. Banner's self-image skyrocketed as he embraced his new form, becoming as beloved as the other Avengers after being feared as Hulk in the past. He coined the catchphrase "Hulk out" to capitalize on his newfound popularity.

Rejoining the Avengers
Banner meets Scott Lang
In 2023, Banner met with Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Scott Lang at a diner in order to discuss using the Quantum Realm to reverse the effects of the Snap. 

Banner talks about merging with the Hulk
At one point, Lang expressed his confusion surrounding Banner's new appearance. Banner responded by stating that they lived in confusing times and joked about how he was now wearing shirts. Lang, still overwhelmed by Banner looking like Hulk but speaking and eating like a human, required further explanation. Banner revealed his guilt about losing twice to Thanos; first as Hulk then as Banner, and because of that, they were defeated.

Banner posing with fans
Banner explained that his guilt and devastation over his failure to stop Thanos provoked him to see Hulk from a new perspective. Instead of the destruction-causing monster, Banner considered that Hulk may be able to help the newly fragile and desperate world. He explained to Lang that after eighteen months in a Gamma Lab, he was able to merge his mind with Hulk's body. At that moment, a group of children, including Lia, Augie, and Julian, asked to take a photo with 'Mr. Hulk', to which Banner gladly obliged. With Lang taking the photo, Hulk and the children said 'Green' in unison.

Banner discusses Scott Lang's theory
Scott asked the children if they wanted a photo with Ant-Man, which the kids rejected. Before the children left they shared a 'Hulk Out!' catchphrase with Banner. Rogers interrupted and reminded Banner about the plan they had pitched. Banner, growing serious, told his teammates that his expertise in the field of physics not being at the level of quantum physics like Stark, the chances of him being able to achieve time travel was not high, to which Natasha reminded him that merging himself with Hulk appeared impossible, too.

Testing Time Travel
Banner preparing to test Time Travel
The Avengers later returned to the New Avengers Facility where they decided to begin their experiences on time travel. They decided to use the Quantum Tunnel experiment with the time scale of bringing Scott Lang into the past and back into the present. Banner mentioned not wanting something to go wrong and have Lang stuck in the 1950s, Natasha Romanoff said he was joking, but Banner was unsure of that, due to the uncertainty of the experiment.

Banner conducts the test on Time Travel
Banner set the machine up to send Lang back a week and bring him back in ten seconds. Banner then attempted to send Lang through time, but instead ended up turning Lang into an old man, a baby, and a teenager, causing them to lose hope that the plan would work. Banner ordered Romanoff to kill the power in order to bring Lang back to his normal self. Romanoff did so and Banner was pleased with how they had just achieved time travel, to which Steve Rogers was not pleased with due to some difficulties sending Lang through time.

Banner shares his tacos with Scott Lang
Thankfully, just then, Tony Stark arrived with a change of heart, proposing a method of safely traversing the Quantum Realm and revealing that the EPR paradox is what caused the Avengers' initial attempt to fail in the first place. Later, Hulk offered his tacos to Lang after his were destroyed by the Benatar landing in the New Avengers Facility.

Finding an Old Friend
Banner and Rocket Raccoon at New Asgard
Hulk joined Rocket in recruiting Thor for the Time Heist. Having flown to Tønsberg, Norway, the pair travelled by a pickup truck for the remainder of the journey. Upon arrival, Rocket noted how New Asgard was a shadow of the gold and glory found in Asgard. Hulk implored Rocket to show some compassion as the Asgardians had lost their home, then half their people. The pair were interrupted by Valkyrie, who warned them that they should not have come. Unimpressed by Hulk's new form, Valkyrie noted that she preferred him either of the other ways.

Banner reunites with an overweight Thor
Banner and Rocket entered Thor's house and were immediately surprised by the stench and mess they encountered. To their shock, they found an overweight and alcoholic Thor, devastated by his failure to kill Thanos before the Snap occurred. Thor embraced his old friends and reintroduced his new housemates, former Contest of Champions Korg and Miek. Korg invited Banner and Rocket to use their free wifi and drink their beer. Hulk and Rocket felt a sense of embarrassment and pity for the demigod reduced to yelling at people through online video games.

Banner tries to comfort Thor to bring him back
Banner reached out Thor, suggesting that they may be able to undo Thanos' Snap. This was met with fear and grief from Thor, who was frightened at the mention of Thanos' name. Banner calmly asked Thor to let go of him, and forced the Asgardian to stop grabbing him. Banner sympathised with Thor's fear, which Thor rejected, reminding everyone that he killed the Mad Titan five years ago. Banner reminded Thor that when he was lost on Sakaar, frightened and confused by his new surroundings; that Thor helped him. Thor reflected on his failed leadership, pointing to half of the Asgardians that perished during the Snap. Banner optimistically noted that they may be able to resurrect them. Thor denied the possibility of hope until Rocket explained they had beer on the ship.

Testing the Advanced Tech Suit
Banner works on the Advanced Tech Suit
Banner and Nebula assisted Scott Lang in preparing for a test run using the Advanced Tech Suit. However, Lang was not ready for the test and accidentally triggered one of the few Pym Particles. Clint Barton appeared from across the lab and volunteered for the next test. As Barton's suit was being prepared, James Rhodes suggested that instead of collecting the Infinity Stones, the team should travel back in time and kill Thanos as a child.

Banner explains time travel
Disgusted, Banner immediately rejected Rhodes' idea; claiming it was immoral and scientifically impossible. Banner explained to Rhodes, Lang and Barton that changing the past does not change the future. Banner operated the Quantum Realm machine as Barton successfully traveled to his homestead prior to the Snap and back, demonstrating their plan had worked.

Locating the Infinity Stones
Banner learns about the Soul Stone
With the means of time travel accounted for, the Avengers brainstormed when and where they could retrieve the Infinity Stones from. Thor talked about the origins and location of the Aether, but was distracted by his emotions and past trauma. Rocket Raccoon informed the team about the Power Stone and how Peter Quill stole it from Morag. Nebula revealed the Soul Stone and how Thanos killed her sister on Vormir.

The Avengers complete their plan
Banner, Tony Stark and Natasha Romanoff discussed Doctor Strange, the Time Stone and the New York Sanctum. Romanoff pointed out that if the team selected the right date, they could acquire three stones in New York City. Banner was teamed up with Iron Man, Captain America and Ant-Man to travel to New York City on May 4, 2012 so they could easily obtain the Space, Mind and Time Stones at once.

Time Heist
Meeting the Ancient One
Banner prepares to enter the Quantum Realm
When Banner, Iron Man, Ant-Man, and Captain America traveled to the alternate 2012 timeline, they landed in New York City during the Battle of New York. The four witnessed 2012 Hulk brutally murdering a few Chitauri and smashing everything in his way, causing Banner to look away in embarrassment. Captain America suggested that Banner destroyed objects around him to make himself look like 2012 Hulk. Banner hesitantly agreed and took off his shirt, then proceeded to smash a nearby car, roaring weakly to sound like his old self. He jumped across tall buildings to reach the New York Sanctum where the Ancient One was fighting off Chitauri. He went to the roof and began looking for Doctor Strange and encountered the Ancient One.

Banner encounters the Ancient One in 2012
The Ancient One responded by saying that Strange was not with her and would not be with her for 5 years to come. Hulk then attempted to take the Time Stone only for his opponent to force out his astral form. At first, she refused because she claimed it would leave her timeline in disarray against future threats she would require the Time Stone to defend against. Though Banner reasoned they could return each Infinity Stone to its respective timeline at the moment it was taken and avert potential catastrophe, she declared she couldn't risk her reality on the off chance that he may or may not survive to return the stones and explained the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone with their life, leading Hulk to question why Strange gave it up to Thanos in the first place, much to the Ancient One's surprise.

Banner is given the Time Stone
The Ancient One then realized that if he had done this, it was for a good reason. She then restored Hulk to his body and handed him the stone and made sure he was confident that he would return with it. After receiving the stone, Hulk reunited with the rest of the Avengers in 2012 and went back to 2023 through the Quantum Realm.

Creating the Nano Gauntlet
Banner learns of Natasha Romanoff's death
The Avengers returned from the Time Heist and were shocked by its apparent success. The team's celebrations were cut short by Hawkeye, who fell to his knees. Hulk immediately asked Barton about Natasha Romanoff's whereabouts; to which Barton only looked on in devastation. Realizing that Romanoff was dead, Hulk fell to his knees and pounded the platform with his fist.

Banner mourns Natasha Romanoff's death
The remaining original Avengers gathered outside the New Avengers Facility to mourn Romanoff's sacrifice. Hulk spent the majority of the discussion staring mournfully across the lake. Thor encouraged the team to pull together and attempt to resurrect her with the Infinity Stones, which was met with renouncement and anger from Barton. Hulk suddenly vented his anger by throwing a piece of furniture across the lake. Proclaiming that Romanoff could not return, Hulk charged the team with making her sacrifice worthwhile.

Blip
Banner works on the Nano Gauntlet
Tony Stark, Hulk and Rocket finalized the creation of the Nano Gauntlet as they assembled all six Infinity Stones into their new creation. Rocket asked which member of the team would be the one to snap their fingers and revive half of all life. Thor immediately volunteered, to the skepticism of the team.

Banner listens to the Avengers argue
The God of Thunder reminded everyone that he was the strongest Avenger, so the responsibility fell upon him. Stark agreed, but noted that he was in no condition to perform the task. Across the room, Banner was deep in thought, considering their only option. Stark reminded Thor that the gauntlet had enough energy to power a continent, but Thor responded by stating that lightning ran in his veins.

Banner decides to wield the Nano Gauntlet
At this moment, Banner interjected, stating that Thor's lightning wouldn't help him. Instead, Banner announced that he had to be the one to undo the Snap. As he walked towards the gauntlet, he reminded the team that the Stones almost killed Thanos, and that none of them would survive. Rogers questioned if they knew Banner would survive, to which Hulk admitted he did not know. Banner believed he had the best chance, given that the Stones emmitted mostly gamma radiation. Banner noted the irony of the situation; that were he not exposed to the Gamma radiation all those years ago, he would not be able to save half of all life.

Hulk prepares to reverse the Snap
Before he wielded the gauntlet, Stark reminded Hulk to only bring back the victims of the Snap, and not kill anyone who had been born afterwards. Hulk understood Stark's instructions as F.R.I.D.A.Y. locked down the New Avengers Facility. As the gauntlet expanded onto Hulk's right hand, Banner reminded himself that everyone would come home, should he succeed. The gauntlet sent electricity through Hulk's arm, burning him from his hand to his shoulder.

Banner wielding the Nano Gauntlet
Initially unable to bear the pain of the Infinity Stones' combined energy, Hulk composed himself. Stark and Rogers asked if he was alright, to which Banner assured them that he was still okay. After a moment, Banner composed himself and began to scream as he found the strength to raise the guantlet and snap his fingers. After a flash of light, the emitted energy caused Hulk to pass out and drop the gauntlet.

Banner is overwhelmed by the Infinity Stones
Stark applied a cooling agent to Banner's right arm, which was horribly scared and disintegrated. Banner asked the team if the Snap worked and Thor assured him that they were not sure. At that moment, Barton recieved a call from his wife Laura, who had perished in the Snap. Ant-Man noticed birds outside the facility, and stated that they may have succeeded. However, their celebration was short-lived as Hulk, to his horror, saw 2014 Thanos' ship outside the New Avengers Facility, which opened fire on the Avengers mere seconds later.

Attack on the New Avengers Facility
Hulk holds up the rubble
After Thanos completely wiped out the New Avengers Facility, Hulk was trapped underground with War Machine and Rocket Raccoon. He protected his fellow Avengers by holding back the falling rubble. However, this would prove to be futile as water began rushing in from the nearby lake, threatening to drown all three of them.

Hulk joins the battle against Thanos
As Hulk continued to fight off the falling debris and War Machine and Rocket began to accept their fate, Ant-Man rushed towards them to save them by turning into a giant. The four Avengers were the last to join the battle, escaping the rubble after Ant-Man burst through the debris. Hulk smiled at the realization that he had succeeded at resurrecting the victims of the Snap, bringing half of all life in the universe back into existence.

Battle of Earth

After Captain America rallied the Avengers and their allies, Hulk joined the battle and charged towards Thanos' forces. Early in the battle, Hulk smashed a Chitauri Chariot, killing its occupants. Hulk fought alongside the Masters of the Mystic Arts, the Ravagers, Asgardians, and Wakandans.

Hulk during the Battle of Earth
During the battle, Hawkeye emerged from the underground with the Nano Gauntlet and asked Captain America what to do with it. Captain America ordered that the Infinity Stones be removed as far from the battle as possible. However, Hulk interjected, stating that the Stones had to be returned to their original locations, remembering the promise he made to the Ancient One.

Hulk being saved from attack by War Machine
Later in the battle, when Thanos ordered an airstrike from the Sanctuary II, Hulk was knocked back by one of the blasts but was saved by War Machine. The battle was ultimately concluded when Iron Man obtained the Infinity Stones and wiped out Thanos and his army. However, this action cost Iron Man his life due to the power of the Infinity Stones. Following Hawkeye, all the heroes show their respect for the fallen hero and kneeled before him.

Returning the Stones

Hulk later attended the funeral of Tony Stark along with the rest of the Avengers, standing next to Thor as they watched Pepper Potts and Morgan Stark place Stark's Arc Reactor in the lake.

Banner tells Steve Rogers about the mission
Later, he prepared the time machine so that Steve Rogers could return the time-displaced Infinity Stones and Mjølnir back to the periods they were found. He warned Rogers that if the Stones were not returned to their original positions, countless alternate realities would be opened, many of which would be dangerous. As he discussed the mission with Rogers, Hulk mourned Natasha Romanoff's death, stating he tried to bring her back with those killed in the Snap.

Banner notices Steve Rogers as an old man
Rogers parted ways with Hulk, Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson before traveling back in time to return the Infinity Stones and Mjølnir. Wilson asked Hulk how long the mission would take, to which Hulk contended it would only take five seconds in their time. Wilson interrogated Hulk after Rogers missed his timestamp, provoking Hulk to check the system's diagnostics. However, Barnes pointed to a man sitting on a bench before the lake. Hulk shared in Wilson's surprise that Rogers chose to remain in the past with Peggy Carter.

Reverting to Human
Meeting Shang-Chi
Sometime later, Banner transformed back to his human form. However, the injury he had sustained to his right arm while in Hulk's body remained, forcing him to continue to keep it in a sling. In 2024, after Shang-Chi used the Ten Rings, they sent out a beacon which was detected by the Masters of the Mystic Arts. Wong got in contact with Banner and Carol Danvers as well as Shang-Chi, who had become the new owner of the Rings, to better understand the mysterious items. Neither Danvers or Banner were familiar with the Rings, only knowing they had existed for thousands of years, and that they were sending out a message, but did not know to where.

Danvers was then abruptly called away, telling Shang-Chi that it was nice to meet him and that if he wished to speak to her further, he could get her number from Banner, and left the meeting. Banner then informed Shang-Chi that he did not have her number and that Danvers often disappeared for long stretches of time. Needing to attend to other matters, Banner bid Shang-Chi farewell after welcoming him to their world of heroes.

Personality
Bruce Banner is shown as a mild-mannered, mysterious, shy and analytical man of science. The incident at Culver University caused Banner to become somewhat mentally troubled and obsessed with finding a cure for his mutation. He is compassionate and afraid of hurting someone unintentionally, so he tries not to get close to something or someone that leaves him stressed.

In turn, Hulk is more primitive, with his senses amplified to such an extent that it is difficult for his brain to process it all. In Banner's own words, he describes the experience as "It's like someone poured a liter of acid into my brain." When Banner returns to his normal human form, he has little recollection of events aside from fragments and images. In his earliest transformations, Hulk appeared as a simple-minded savage with little to no ability to distinguish friend from foe. Because of this, he was responsible for the deaths of two scientists, an army officer, a police officer from Idaho, and two Canadian hunters when he was a fugitive. However, while extremely aggressive and destructive, Hulk primarily attacked when provoked as a form of self-defense and wanted to be alone, often fleeing and ending up in areas uninhabited by humans like caves or forests to calm himself. 

Ever since his first transformation Banner was terribly afraid of Hulk and the risk of him hurting those around him. He abandoned everyone and everything he cared about and became a fugitive for five years to prevent Hulk's power from falling into the wrong hands, while desperately searching for a cure and attempting to avoid transforming at all costs. On some occasions, he lost the hope of getting rid of his other persona and showed suicidal tendencies, attempting to kill himself once. The only times he was willing to let himself transform was during the Battle of New York, when attempting to intimidate Scarlet Witch, as he was angry with her for having set Hulk loose on Johannesburg, to the point where he threatened to kill her without even transforming, and when he tried to protect the Asgardians from Hela, her army of Berserkers and the Fenris. Despite this, he still dislikes having to transform into Hulk to battle, as it would require him to harm and kill others, which he expressed after the Attack on the HYDRA Research Base, as Thor commented on Hulk's kills and inadvertently made Banner feel ashamed and regretful.

Hulk keeps fragments of Banner's personality and gradually attained a better reasoning capacity over time, becoming able to show affection, demonstrating a capacity to work collaboratively with others once they've established a rapport with him, and evidencing he's capable of directing his savagery at foes instead of allies. Betty suggested that this is because Banner's mind is still within Hulk and can influence his behavior to a degree. Even in his early stages, the mostly taciturn Hulk has demonstrated being capable of crude, rudimentary speech, notably telling soldiers to leave him alone in Brazil and calling Loki a “puny god” after repeatedly hammering him into the floor of Stark Tower. Over time, he supplemented his scientific pursuit by learning meditation and breathing techniques, gaining a greater control over the transformations. Banner discovered that by focusing during the moment of transformation he can control Hulk's destructive behavior or at least "aim" it at a desired target, first seen during the Duel of Harlem. Notably, Banner's emotional bonds to those closest to him persisted even during his earliest transformation, as Hulk has always been able to recognize and been protective of Betty Ross. In the past, people whom Banner has had romantic feelings for in particular have acted as Hulk's handler, as they are able to soothe him into a calmer state. Hulk would check his aggression if Betty desired it and would be given a lullaby to lull him into his normal state by Black Widow.

After having shown some success in controlling the monster, he seemed to have abandoned the search for a cure and redeemed himself, helping sick people in poor areas of the world. Thus, he appeared to be more comfortable and sarcastic in various situations with fellow Avengers. He is no longer even afraid to get angry as it no longer triggers a transformation instantly. Tony Stark encouraged Banner to see Hulk as an ally rather than a destructive curse by pointing out that Hulk technically saved his life when the Gamma exposure accident occurred. Eventually Banner became confident enough to bring out Hulk voluntarily knowing he won't attack his allies. While initially compelled into conflict due to his aggressive survival instincts and Banner’s attempts to influence him, Hulk has also displayed being pleased when given the chance to channel his aggression, notably grinning after being told by Captain America to “smash” invading Chitauri. Similarly, Hulk was shown smiling after being unleashed from Banner by Natasha, who intentionally knocked him off a platform. This was seemingly due to both his and Bruce’s bond with Natasha, as well as being freed from Banner’s control. 

However, Banner is the Avenger his teammates are the most wary of despite their camaraderie and often don't call Hulk to a battle unless strictly necessary. Though Banner is able to suppress his transformations through emotional intelligence, he has been known to lose control or be manipulated into losing control. Should he be completely overwhelmed with rage or stress, he loses all reason and Hulk regresses back into a volatile, rampaging monster. Moreover, Hulk would also sometimes show reluctance to revert back into Banner and relinquish his control over their body, becoming more self-aware. In fact, Hulk would consistently become belligerent when being referred to as Banner, something Stark remembered being warned about after him making this very mistake sent a mind-controlled Hulk into a violent rage. Because of this, Banner had requested Stark to build the Hulkbuster armor. For example, he once attacked Black Widow on the Helicarrier, when they were blasted out of the lab and he transformed and attacked her, and when the Scarlet Witch used her mental manipulation powers on him in South Africa to force him to transform. As her influence faded, Hulk showed remorse at the destruction he caused the people caught in the crossfire of his rampage before being briefly provoked at the site of armed police approaching and knocked unconscious by Iron Man. After the War against Ultron, Hulk himself decided to abandon his Avengers friends and exile himself much like he did when he defeated Abomination.
