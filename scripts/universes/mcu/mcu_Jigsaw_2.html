<html><p>On the outskirts of New York City, Russo stood alone as he awaited the arrival of William Rawlins. When Rawlins finally arrived, Russo listened as he ranted about how the United States of America used to be built on industries like coal, iron and steel whereas it was now run by markets and bankers who they were beholden to. Rawlins noted that it was time for them to go after Frank Castle, despite Russo warning that they would get in the way of a Homeland Security investigation which would be a risk to them being discovered.

Russo and William Rawlins discuss Punisher
Rawlins insisted that they had to kill Castle before he was arrested and confessed everything that happened with Operation Cerberus, so Russo agreed provided that they did not use anyone from Anvil's payroll, as he deemed it too risky and he had now lost too many of his own men already when they had gone after Gunner Henderson. When Russo insisted on finding outside operators who would not be cheap Rawlins moaned about how it always came down to money, to which Russo noted that Rawlins had never even had to worry about money once in his life, which Rawlins merely scoffed at.

Russo gives William Rawlins a vague threat
As Russo questioned if Rawlins still thought he was better than him, Rawlins insulted him by claiming that Russo's pride was a weakness. Rawlins gave Russo the authorization to get his soldiers and wait for him to give him all the tactical plans from Homeland Security so that they could then allow the mission to go ahead. Rawlins then insulted Russo once again by questioning if he was now concerned about going against Dinah Madani, which Russo then denied as he stood over Rawlins and insisted that there was still nobody he was afraid of going against before Rawlins then walked away from him.

Recruiting Soldiers
Russo recruits former soldiers for a mission
With William Rawlins permission, Russo gathered together his team his outside operators for the mission, meeting them just outside New York City where they would not be bothered by anyone who could possibly be spying on them. As they arrived at the location, Spencer Geiger jokingly questioned if they were not welcome at Anvil Headquarters anymore to which Russo noted that it was best they not be seen together as last time they worked together he blamed them for shooting the wrong people in front of all the wrong people.

Russo tells Tom Weems about the payment
As the group complained about being unable to get work since the last time when they had shot civilians in Iraq, Tom Weems questioned what could do for them, to which Russo promised to get them a job which would be to hunt down and assassinate Frank Castle which would be top secret and completely deniable for them. When Weems questioned how that helped them with the people seeking to take them down, Russo promised them cheques of fifty thousand dollars in exchange for their work, which they all agreed to as Geiger noted that clearly somebody really needed Castle to be killed.

Abandoned Warehouse Ambush
Russo prepares for the warehouse ambush
With the intel gathered by William Rawlins, Russo's team waited in their van and prepared themselves for a firefight, with Russo packing extra knives along with his various guns. Russo observed his team and, once they were all ready to go, covered his face with a mask to protect his own identity as they all quietly stormed the Abandoned Warehouse and awaited Frank Castle's arrival so they could finally take him out once and for all, making their way up the stairs with their guns drawn and ready to immediately fire upon Castle.

Russo's own team is cornered by Homeland
As Russo and his team made their way into a large hallway however, they were then suddenly surrounded by Homeland Security who ordered them to drop their weapons and surrender. Russo ignored the order and fired upon one of the agents, which killed him instantly, resulting in a violent firefight breaking out. Russo's own team quickly found themselves outgunned and outmatched as the agents came at them from all sides, killing Jim Pruitt and Mike Bashille in the chaos. As Russo struggled to see a way out, he pushed Spencer Geiger into the line of fire as he then made a sudden run for freedom.

Russo decides to shoot and kill Tom Weems
Russo charged down the stairs followed by Tom Weems, who was then wounded by a shot to his legs, causing him to fall to the floor. As Weems begged for help, Russo ignored his cries and instead fired a single shot into Weems' skull, killing him instantly to ensure Weems could not give Homeland his name if he had been captured. As he fired several more warning shots behind him, Russo then made his own desperate run for freedom while he still could, followed closely by Dinah Madani as Russo made it back outside. As another agent almost saw him, Russo managed to kill him with a single bullet.

Russo brutally murdering Agent Sam Stein
Before Russo could get away however, Sam Stein appeared and held Russo at gunpoint, ordering him to drop his weapon and get down onto his knees. Russo did as instructed and allowed Stein, who was now confident that Russo was defenseless to get close to him. Once Stein removed Russo's main knife, he then removed Russo's face mask and briefly paused in surprise at seeing who was to blame. But Russo used his brief pause to his own advantage by using his hidden wrist blade to stab Stein multiple times into the throat before leaving him to bleed out as Russo proceeded to make his escape.

Caring for Madani
Russo washes the blood off Dinah Madani
Russo left Dinah Madani to find the dead agent and the dying Sam Stein as he made his escape, knowing that even if Stein survived long enough to be found by her, he would be unable to tell her Russo's deception due to choking on his own blood. Russo then returned to the scene of the crime to pick up the traumatized Madani as he took her back into the Madani Residence where he put her in the bath and softly cleaned all Stein's blood off her face, with Madani unaware that Russo was responsible.

Russo refuses Dinah Madani's offer for sex
Russo soon returned to the Madani Residence and questioned why Madani was not out dealing with all of the Bombings over New York City, to which Madani claimed that Homeland Security did not want her out there before kissing Russo and trying to remove his clothes. Russo argued that sex would not make all of the pain go away, much to her annoyance. Russo explained how he had been to seventeen funerals for friends and other men he had served with in the United States Armed Forces, to which Madani asked if any of these deaths were his fault, with Russo noting that maybe that was the case.

Russo discusses how Sam Stein had died
Russo then questioned if Stein himself had been to blame for his own death, noting that Stein had managed to get stabbed while he was still holding a gun to his killer. All of this still did not stir up Madani, despite Russo arguing that she needed to get back out there and seek out the terrorist who was attacking New York City, with Russo even suggesting that if she could not do this then she should then consider retiring from active duty with Homeland Security; however, Madani then just noted that her career was likely finished regardless of whether she got out of bed or not due to her previous actions.

Russo is forced to consider his own actions
Madani then confessed to Russo that the Ambush at the Abandoned Warehouse had been her attempt to kill the men hunting Frank Castle which had resulted in the deaths of several agents including Stein which she was directly responsible for. Russo argued that Madani had just been trying to do the right thing, although she insisted that nobody would care about her intentions but only the results of her actions. Russo noted that the people judging her had not been there and so did not understand, to which Madani noted that neither was he before walking away, as Russo considered his next move.

Anvil Protection Job
Russo personally greeting Senator Stan Ori
In the wake of the terrorist's threats, Russo and Anvil were hired by Senator Stan Ori as private security. Russo introduced himself to Ori in the Royal Hospitality who questioned Russo's own views on the terrorist, to which Russo had explained that he would be more than happy to kill him in the blink of an eye in the wake of the Bombings over New York City. Ori questioned if such violence only caused more violence, to which Russo noted that he made a living from violence, recommending Ori view Anvil's presence as his life insurance.

Russo agreeing to work for Senator Stan Ori
Ori noted that he was a key spokesman in the anti-gun debate which would make him hiring armed guards problematic, to which Russo questioned if his personal principles were worth dying for. Impressed by this, Ori hired Anvil as Russo promised to begin work immediately, leaving Isaac Lange and Simon to stand guard while Russo collected more agents and provided needed security measures. When Russo had joked about killing the terrorist in the most humane way possible, Ori laughed before shaking Russo's hand and welcoming onboard as Russo had then left Lange there while he got some more agents.

Russo and Stan Ori discuss his protection
With all of his guards in place, Russo then spoke with Ori about their upcoming interview with the New York Bulletin, with Ori insisting on doing the interview downstairs in public while Russo insisted that this would be a mistake. As Ori had claimed that hiding in his hotel room from the terrorist would send out the wrong message to their public, Russo claimed he was less concerned with Ori's image than he was over keeping Ori from being assassinated. Getting a call, Russo then quietly excused himself as he then stepped outside of the room and had answered the call to find Frank Castle was on the other line.

Russo is suddenly called by Frank Castle
Castle noted just how business with Anvil must be good due to their newest high value target, although Russo then noted that according to the news reports this was all down to Castle himself. Russo once again noted that his offer to get Castle out of New York City was still on the table if he wanted it to avoid being arrested. Castle noted that Wilson was already on his way to assassinate Ori to keep him from making his speech, explaining that Wilson had told him this directly. Castle suggested getting Ori safe while Castle could ambush and kill Wilson, telling Russo to keep all of the Anvil agents out of his way.

Russo introduces himself to Karen Page
As Castle hung up the call, Russo met Karen Page as she arrived to interview Ori, immediately noting that he was aware that Page carried a gun with her, promising she could get the gun returned once their interview was over. They discussed the irony of an anti-gun Senator choosing the military contractor as his new private security, to which Russo jokingly claimed Anvil was their best choice out there. When Page questioned where Russo studied to gain such good marketing skills, he answered that it had been in Afghanistan, before welcoming her into Ori's hotel suite in order to finally begin their interview.

Attack on Stan Ori
Russo goes to speak with Dinah Madani
While making his way throughout the hotel with a small team of Anvil agents, Russo encountered Dinah Madani who had been waiting for him, with Russo noting that he thought it was great to see her back at work in the wake of the recent incidents involving her. Russo noted that he could not really talk due to still protecting Stan Ori, to which Madani claimed she was there to talk about some of Anvil's agents, handing him the files of Tom Weems and the others on that team, with Madani noting that they had killed her agents and had also previously worked for Anvil.

Russo catches back up with Dinah Madani
Russo insisted that he did not have a personal connection to these men, claiming that although they had indeed previously worked for him several years ago, but they had also likely worked freelance for other organizations, claiming that Anvil had a strict policy on not to rehire men who had ever worked for criminal organizations. Russo questioned what Madani and Homeland Security had been involved with to cross paths with these men before questioning if he had become a suspect in Sam Stein's death, with Madani noting that the fifth man on the team had escaped without being identified.

Russo realizes that something is now wrong
Russo promised Madani that he was look into the case to find the fifth suspect, before then suggesting that he come into the Madani Residence later that night to then discuss it further, although Madani rejected this. Changing the subject, Madani noted that if the New York Bulletin was to be believed, then Russo was protecting Ori from both Lewis Wilson and Frank Castle, questioning if Russo was willing to kill his friend to which Russo claimed that if he had to he would. As they discussed Castle, Russo was suddenly alerted by an alarm and realized one of his agents was not answering his radio.

Russo taking careful aim at Frank Castle
While Wilson was causing chaos and Ori was being taken to safety, Russo eventually caught up with Madani and Castle in the hotel's stairway, with Russo attempting to kill Castle by shooting him in the head, missing his shot and wounding Castle. As Castle fell down the stairs, Madani aimed her gun at Russo who attempted to find his shot to finish off his target. As Madani demanded to know why he had fired, Russo claimed he thought that Castle was aiming for her and he was therefore just trying to protect her. Madani demanded that Russo lower his gun, but he refused and continued aiming.

Russo calmly allows himself to be arrested
Madani insisted that she was a federal agent ordering him to lower his weapon, but still Russo refused, before comparing his actions to war and claiming that the only crime in war would be to lose. Madani noted that she had realized that Russo had indeed killed Stein during the Ambush at the Abandoned Warehouse, as Russo then aimed his gun at Madani. Before Russo could execute Castle and Madani, he was suddenly found by the New York City Police Department who took Russo and Madani into custody while Castle was able to get away and later assisted in killing Wilson during the chaos.

Questioned by Brett Mahoney
Russo being questioned by Brett Mahoney
During the wake of the recent Attack on Stan Ori, Russo had soon sat down beside Detective Sergeant Brett Mahoney of the New York City Police Department to give his statement based on the incident. Mahoney began by asking Russo directly about Lewis Wilson and how Wilson had been offered a job at Anvil, with Russo noting the interview itself had been a favor for Curtis Hoyle and Wilson had soon been rejected for as to Wilson's poor mental health.

Russo discusses Lewis Wilson's ambush
Discussing how Wilson had been able to breach all Anvil's security, Mahoney explained that Wilson had killed Isaac Lange and taken his uniform, noting that this had made breaching their security so easy. Seeing that Mahoney was questioning his team's skills, Russo noting that Ori was still alive thanks to the work of Anvil, pointing out that four Anvil agents had just been killed and so they should not be accused of negligence now. Russo then turned the questions back on Mahoney, comparing the United States Armed Forces with the Police Department to insist they completed the mission.

Russo is directly asked about Frank Castle
Mahoney noted that it was a big coincidence involved with his case due to Russo almost recruiting Wilson and having served alongside Frank Castle who was now believed to have been working alongside Wilson to try to assassinate Ori. Tired of the questioning, Russo then insisted that either Mahoney arrest him or he would walk away. As Russo attempted to walk away, Mahoney demanded to know when had been the last time he had spoken with Castle, to which Russo claimed he had not spoken to him in two years, also claiming he had believed Castle was dead before then before walking away.

Making Statements
Russo makes a statement of WHiH News
In the wake of the Attack on Stan Ori, Russo decided to give a public statement on WHiH World News as he claimed that he had believed his friend Frank Castle had been dead but declared that the man Castle had become was a monster. On behalf of Anvil, Russo promised that his priority would be finding Castle, who was still on the run after Lewis Wilson's death, and vowed that Anvil would contribute in anyway they could, questioning what had happened to Castle.

Russo arrives back at Homeland Security
Russo then made a trip to the Homeland Security Headquarters upon being summoned to give a statement on the recent events, being accompanied by two armed guards. Russo arrived in the main room where agent Dinah Madani thanked him for coming, to which Russo joked that he had made his living from being around whenever the government called. Russo sat down for his interview, which Madani recorded as she presented him with pictures from the Ambush at the Abandoned Warehouse, including images of the men killed at their shootout, to which Russo questioned why he was there.

Russo makes a statement on recent events
Madani presented Russo with an image of Sam Stein's corpse and accused him of being a murderer who was soon going to pay. Russo, however, claimed that he had only been at that location to collect Madani before saying on camera that he had brought her back to the Madani Residence and noting that they had previously engaged in a sexual relationship within that residence. Madani then questioned if Russo and Castle had engaged in illegal actions while stationed they had both been stationed in Kandahar, to which Russo noted that his own file showed no record of him being stationed in Kandahar.

Russo is calmly threatened by Dinah Madani
Madani then turned off the camera before giving Russo the offer to give her everything on Operation Cerberus and his own dealings with William Rawlins, with the mention of Rawlins' name causing Russo to look up. While Madani issued him with threats, Russo claimed that Madani was merely haunted by the deaths of both Stein and Ahmad Zubair and was looking for someone to target, to which Madani then noted that she was looking for Castle who in turn was now aiming to kill Russo for his betrayal if Madani was not able to capture him first, causing Russo to then reconsider her offer for safety.

Desperate Measures
Kidnapping of the Liebermans
Russo and Rawlins kidnap the Liebermans
Using the CIA's surveillance equipment, William Rawlins was able to discover that Frank Castle had just recently been in contact with the family of the believed to be deceased David Lieberman when Zach Lieberman called a hotline in order to give up information on Castle's current whereabouts. Russo had agent Jack go into the Lieberman Residence where they proceeded to kidnap both Zach and Sarah Lieberman. Russo then had the pair tied up in an empty warehouse in the hope that Castle would seek them out, allowing Russo to assassinate him.

Russo questions William Rawlins' new plan
While looking at the utterly terrified Liebermans, Russo questioned if Rawlins had known that David Lieberman was alive, to which Rawlins noted that Carson Wolf had assured him that he had been murdered. Russo claimed that the entire situation was currently getting out of hand since he had killed Homeland Security agents and that Rawlins' name was somehow now known by Dinah Madani. Rawlins noted that he had gotten Marion James involved in the operation, meaning if they were caught then the CIA would come out looking bad, which James did not want to happen, meaning they were protected.

Russo insults William Rawlins' cowardliness
Russo, however, noted that none of them were safe now that Castle knew that he was involved, with Rawlins recommending that as they would all be in danger as long as he was alive, they go into Micro's Hideout where Castle had been tracked to using Sarah Lieberman's phone and finally assassinate him. Russo had refused to go himself, refusing to expose himself any more than he already had, instead sending in his Anvil agents. Russo suggested that Rawlins go in person, which he refused to do as he did not wish to get his hands dirty with their situation, which did not surprise Russo.

Ambush in Micro's Hideout
Russo getting an update from Agent Jack
While Russo watched over Sarah and Zach Lieberman, he sent a squad of well armed Anvil agents to Micro's Hideout in an attempt to find and kill Frank Castle once and for all. Shortly after they arrived, Russo was called by Jack who informed him that there seemed to be nobody at the Hideout anymore, but they had found footage of Cerberus Squad while they were torturing and killing Ahmad Zubair as well as a mysterious count down on the computer. When Russo learned that Castle's phone was still there, he realized that this was his trap and ordered them to get out.

Russo makes a new deal with the Punisher
Russo's conversation with Jack was cut short as the Punisher then caused an explosion as he ambushed the entire team. Having waited several minutes, Russo's phone rang again only for Castle to be on the other side accusing Russo of not having the balls to face him in person and sending in his men to do his dirty work. Castle vowed that sooner or later they would face off in which one would kill the other, which Russo denied as Castle was a wanted man and would likely be captured or killed by Homeland Security before they could ever face off against each other one final time.

Russo personally arrives in Micro's Hideout
Castle warned that if anything happened to either of the Liebermans, then Micro would release everything on Operation Cerberus, so they agreed to have an exchange for Micro and Punisher in exchange for the Liebermans, which Castle agreed to as he told Russo to contact him was everything was arranged before hanging up. Russo then traveled to hideout where he discovered all of the corpses Castle had left in his wake, alongside the footage of William Rawlins torturing Zubair and the countdown clock, causing Russo to then curse as he considered what his next actions would be.

Capture of Frank Castle
Russo closely watches the exchange begin
Russo arranged the trade of the Punisher and Micro in exchange for the Sarah and Zach Lieberman. Russo took position with his sniper rifle as he watched the exchange got underway, with the Liebermans under threat of being burned alive if anything went wrong. However, suddenly Homeland Security agents arrived on the scene, causing chaos as Castle was captured while Lieberman was seemingly killed during the crossfire. Russo cursed for Lieberman's death before shooting out Homeland Security's tires and making his escape.

Russo speaks with the captured Punisher
Taking Frank Castle back to Micro's Hideout, Russo awoke him as Castle noted that the Hideout was looking better since it was now covered in the blood of Anvil agents. Russo noted that while he was in Cerberus Squad he had never considered what it would be like to be in his victim's place, which Castle was now in. Russo questioned why Homeland Security had turned up, with Castle denying that he had any knowledge while questioning if Lieberman had called them, noting that he did not want to see Russo and William Rawlins under arrest, but he instead wanted to see both of them dead.

Russo laughs at all of the Punisher's threats
Russo, however, merely laughed at all Castle's threats, claiming that Castle stood no chance of ever winning and would not be able to kill him or Rawlins, just telling him that the last choice Castle would be allowed to make would be how he would die. Russo noted that the Liebermans were safe as Castle demanded to know where Micro was, to which Russo explained that Micro was dead and so Castle had to turn off the footage of Ahmad Zubair's death. Castle asked Russo if the Massacre at Central Park was unavoidable, questioning if Russo had killed Maria Castle and their children himself.

Russo admits the truth about the massacre
Sitting down, Russo told Castle he had not been at Central Park, also noting that if he was then he would not have missed the chance to kill Castle himself, claiming that he had told Ray Schoonover that he wanted no part in their deaths. As Castle cried upon learning his own friend had been aware that all his family would be slaughtered, Russo told him to look him in the eye while Russo insisted that he had never wanted any of this to happen. Russo offered Castle an easy or hard death, while he called Russo's bluff, telling Russo to kill him himself, knowing he could not until the countdown had stopped.

Frank Castle's Torture
Russo gets up close to Frank Castle's face
Russo continued mocking Frank Castle, even when Castle accused him of purely being obsessed with his own self image. Russo claimed that this were about who he saw when he looked in the mirror, telling Castle when he knew when he looked in the mirror Castle only saw some who lost his wife and his two children and would soon lose his life, to which Castle claimed that Russo had lost his honor every since he had accepted money to commit treason.

Russo stands by as William Rawlins arrives
Russo noted that they had both witnessed breaking while in these situations and demanded the passcode, just as William Rawlins then entered the room, promising that things would get considerably more painful if he did not comply. Castle questioned if Russo really trusted Rawlins, asking if Morty Bennett had also trusted him before he had been murdered, but Rawlins explained that he and Russo had mutual interests. Russo then watched on as Rawlins put on his heavy leather gloves and then began striking Castle across the face multiple times, eventually causing Castle to lose some teeth and spit out blood.

Russo cleans up all of Frank Castle's injuries
Several hours into the torture, Russo had begun cleaning up Castle's blood from his face as he began to question who and what Castle was protecting, as everyone he cared about was now dead, including Gunner Henderson and Micro, and they were all dead because of Castle's actions. Russo then suggested that Castle give up and allow Russo to give him a clean death, until finally Castle claimed that he was ready to die, begging Russo to be the one to kill him cleanly and not Rawlins, as he knew Rawlins would prefer to continue torturing him until his heart gave out through all of the agonizing pain.

Russo agreeing to kill Frank Castle himself
Russo agreed to Castle's wish to kill him as Castle confessed that the way to turn off the countdown was using a retinal scanner which was on Micro's desk and a passcode which he knew. Russo had his Anvil agents drag Castle's chair up onto the computer, ordering the hacker to move aside so Castle could enter the passcode which his fingerprints and use the retinal scanner to end the countdown. Both Russo and Rawlins watched while Castle entered the code and used the retinal scan, finally stopping the footage of Cerberus Squad while they tortured and killed Ahmad Zubair, much to their relief.

Russo watches Castle turning off the video
However, just as Rawlins began mocking Castle and claiming that he was disappointed in him, Castle drew a blade hidden under his chair and plunged it into Rawlins' chest before anybody could react fast enough to stop him. Russo desperately attempted to pull Rawlins away but Castle was still able to drag him over and bit into Rawlins' neck, causing the CIA agent to scream out in agony. As they wrestled on the floor, Russo then struck Castle with the butt of his gun, finally freeing Rawlins from his grip as Rawlins proceeded to kick Castle in the head out of anger and knocked him unconscious.

Betraying William Rawlins
Russo checking on his hacker's progress
Russo monitored the hacker as she deleted all of Micro's files he had left on the computer, while she commented on how they would have never gotten past all of his security. When the hacker noted that she would like to meet Micro, Russo told her he was dead and threatened to kill her if she ever revealed anything she had seen to the public. Russo then began watching as William Rawlins continued torturing Frank Castle, horrified at how deranged Rawlins was.

Russo demands that William Rawlins stop
Interrupting the torture, Russo told Rawlins that Castle had had enough and they should leave the hideout once everything had been wiped from the computers. When Russo noted that he would be killing Castle himself, Rawlins refused, noting that Castle had taken things from him and therefore would not be allowed to die easily, claiming that he did not care about the promise he had made to him. Having heard Rawlins' words, Russo began questioning if he had lost his position within the CIA, asking Rawlins directly what Castle had taken from him, which Rawlins still refused to answer.

Russo and William Rawlins have a face off
Tired on the unneeded pain being caused, Russo dragged Rawlins away from Castle and demanded that he stop, only for Rawlins to furiously claim that Russo still served his needs and should not be involved. Russo claimed he had gotten out of Afghanistan without being mentally damaged and because of Rawlins, he was now being dragged into the mud, with Rawlins claiming that he had pulled him out of the mud. Rawlins then went on to claim that Russo had dirtied himself by killing Homeland Security agents, noting it was because of Rawlins and his CIA influence that Russo had gotten this far.

Russo threatens to finally kill the Punisher
Disgusted, Russo claimed that he should have allowed Castle to kill Rawlins while back in Kandahar as Rawlins laughed in his face at the threat. Wishing to disrupt Rawlins' plans, Russo went behind Castle and placed his gun to the back of his head, with Rawlins ordering him to stop under the threat of then being handed over to Homeland Security. Desperate to be the one to kill Castle, Rawlins drew his gun and aimed it at Russo, noting that Castle owed him an eye. Seeing that Rawlins had become a serious threat to him due to his declining mental stability, Russo quietly cut Castle's ties and walked away.

Russo watches Castle killing William Rawlins
As the hacker informed Russo that she was done and was sent off with her money, Russo watched as Rawlins injected Castle with a burst of adrenaline to ensure he experienced all the pain. Russo kept his distance as he saw Rawlins' attempt to cut out Castle's eye being blocked when Castle broke himself out of his bounds and knocked Rawlins to the floor. Russo calmly took Rawlins' gun away and just watched closely as Castle proceeded to furiously throw Rawlins to the floor, stabbing him repeatedly before beating him senseless and finishing his revenge by plunging his thumbs into Rawlins' eyes.

Russo is forced to run away from Homeland
Russo smiled as Castle fell off Rawlins' bloodied corpse, struggling to breathe, with Russo commenting on how he always liked watching Castle killing somebody. As Russo made his way to the dying Castle, he questioned what he had meant as Castle claimed that he wished he could live long enough to see the look on Russo's face when he realized he was done and would now lose everything. Just as Castle noted he would use Rawlins' own gun to kill Castle, he heard Dinah Madani's Homeland team bursting inside, as Russo was shot in the shoulder and forced to escape before he could kill Castle.

Destruction of Anvil
Russo pulling a bullet out from his arm
Having escaped from inside Micro's Hideout just before he could be captured by any of Dinah Madani's agents and eventually managed to make it back to Anvil Headquarters. Russo focused on pulling out the bullet from his arm before pouring whiskey on the wound to clean it, despite this causing him considerable pain. Having patched up the wound, Russo then collected his weapons and cash and prepared to go on the run, only to then overhear some incoming agents who had managed to find his location and had come to capture and bring Russo to justice.

Russo kills all the agents hunting him down
Using his knowledge of the building's layout to his advantage, Russo managed to kill the two agents who had come inside his own office almost immediately, before taking their radios and making his way towards the exit. As the Homeland Security agents spoke to each other on the radio during their search for their target, Russo used this to learn their positions within the building's hallways in order to get ahead and quietly execute them all with his silenced pistol, with his training in the United States Armed Forces allowing him to kill them with perfect accuracy before they could even see him coming.

Russo calmly destroys Anvil Headquarters
Once Russo had eventually killed all of the Homeland Security agents who he could find within the building, he made his way outside and calmly set off a bomb within the Anvil Headquarters. Without looking back, Russo kept walking as Anvil, the company he had built from the ground up, was completely destroyed in a fireball. Knowing that he had become a high-value target for Homeland Security, and that he had lost everything William Rawlins and he had been building for years, Russo set about finding Frank Castle so that he could execute his revenge against his former friend for ruining his life.

Threatening Curtis Hoyle
Russo reveals himself to Curtis Hoyle
Seeking information, Russo went into Curtis Hoyle's Apartment and awaited his awakening, taking his hidden pistol from underneath the adjacent pillow. Once Curtis Hoyle awoke, Russo revealed himself as Hoyle noted that he had seen reports on the news about Russo being armed and dangerous. Russo questioned if it was Lewis Wilson who had given Hoyle all of the bruises on his face which he confirmed, as Russo noted he would have killed Wilson before he had even gotten a chance, before allowing Hoyle put his false leg on.

Russo questions Hoyle about Frank Castle
Russo questioned how long Hoyle knew Frank Castle was still alive, which he did not answer and instead tried to convince Russo that he needed help. Russo mocked this idea of going to Hoyle's therapy sessions and, when Hoyle questioned if he had really ever turned his life around since leaving the United States Armed Forces, Russo then admitted he did not. Hoyle then got to his feet and asked if he was allowed to make coffee, which Russo told him he could do as Hoyle explained that he had kept Castle's secrets because he was asked to, noting that Castle only ever wanted to protect Russo.

Russo threatening to torture Curtis Hoyle
Russo went on to suggest that Castle was, in fact, the one to blame for everything that had gone wrong before feeling the need to defend the actions of Operation Cerberus by noting the drugs would have gotten out of Afghanistan anyway so he and Ray Schoonover might as well have made the deals. As Hoyle opened all the curtains, he noted that Russo and Castle were very alike, except Castle would never betray a brother, but Russo noted that he was there to force Hoyle to betray Castle, threatening to shoot him in his good leg until he revealed the truth, asking once again where Castle was.

Russo furiously shooting at Curtis Hoyle
Hoyle offered Russo the coffee, taking a drink out of his own to show it was not poisoned. However, just as Russo went to take the coffee, he realized that he had been convinced to step into the center of the room with the windows now fully exposed. Sensing the trap, Russo dived to the floor just as Castle fired a shot from his sniper rifle, barely missing Russo. Furious, Russo dived for cover and shot Hoyle in the shoulder as he hid, with Russo continuing to fire at him. As the shooting stopped, Russo held a knife up to the window which Castle fired at, confirming that he was still aiming for him.

Russo speaks to the Punisher on the phone
As Russo complained that he was taking these betrayals personally, Hoyle's phone then began to ring so Russo allowed him to answer it. Hoyle then told Russo that Castle wanted to speak to him and threw him the phone, as Russo noted that they knew each other so well that they were able to predict each other's attacks. Castle ordered Russo to let Hoyle go to ensure nobody else got hurt but Russo still refused, telling Castle that he intended to hurt everybody Castle ever cared about in order to get to him, threatening to allow Hoyle to bled out, but Castle threatened to call Homeland Security if he did.

Russo arranges to battle the Punisher again
Russo only agreed to leave Hoyle alone, if Castle agreed to empty the rifle, as Russo listened to ensure this happened. Getting onto his feet, Russo made eye contact with Castle and suggested that they meet that night for a final showdown to end their hunt, telling Castle to meet him by the Central Park Carousel, knowing that returning to the sight of the Massacre at Central Park would likely put Castle off balance emotionally and give Russo the advantage. With this agreed upon, Russo gave Castle a military salute and walking out of Hoyle's apartment in order to get ready for the final showdown.

Duel at the Central Park Carousel
Russo takes Carl and Hayley hostage
In order to give himself the clear advantage, Russo decided to capture two young employees at the Central Park and use them as his hostages. Finding Carl and Hayley, who was closing up at the end of the day, Russo cornered them in the office and held them at gunpoint. Russo then proceeded to tie them both up to the carousel horses, with their arms raised, and gave them both heavy cuts on their arms, ensuring that they would bleed heavily unless their arms were lowered.

Russo mockingly calling out the Punisher
Knowing that the Punisher would be getting close, Russo turned on the carousel as Carl and Hayley cried out in pain and fear as they spun around and around. Russo then called Castle on the phone, ensuring that he could see the pair suffering before noting that two more children would soon die because him, reminding Castle of the deaths of Frank Castle, Jr. and Lisa Castle at that same spot during the Massacre at Central Park. However, to Russo's surprise, Castle used the tactic of firing grenades into the air, forcing Russo to have to take cover from all the large charges that were erupting.

Despite being distracting by the explosions, Russo caught sight of the Punisher charging towards him and began firing upon him. The two former friends continued firing upon each other, with Russo managing to shoot Castle in the leg while they both took cover and reloaded. Taking advantage of the fact that Castle needed to pause to bandage his leg, Russo charged across the park and ran just beside the Carousel to find cover. The pair both waited for a clear shot before they both got onboard the Carousel, using the horses as cover as they attempted to find the fatal shot to kill the other.

Knowing that Castle would be emotionally off balance owing to the location they were fighting in, Russo called out to him, claiming that they needed this kind of violence in their lives to feel whole and that this was all they were good for since leaving the United States Armed Forces. Russo claimed that neither of them was good people before they both caught a glimpse of each other and began shooting again and using the fake horses to maintain cover. During the next moment of quiet, Russo then questioned who would mourn them all once they were dead and claimed that they were, in fact, the same.

As they had spotted each other again, Russo fired towards Castle and managed to shoot him in the stomach, with Castle being saved by his vest. However, one of Castle's bullets managed to bounce of a steel pole and embedded itself within Russo's cheek as he screamed out in both pain and anger and the thought of now being permanently scarred on his face. Spitting out the bullet, Russo decided enough was enough, stopping the Carousel and furiously threatening to kill Hayley and Carl if Castle did not show himself, as Russo then ordered the terrified kids to beg for their lives.

Russo shooting at the Punisher in the chest
Punisher did as Russo instructed and came around the corner, telling Russo to let the kids go. Russo, however, demanded that he instead throw away both his gun and his knife, as he told Castle that all his attachments were a weakness and shot Castle in the chest, claiming that he never had anybody. While Castle struggled to stand, Russo shot him again, ignoring Castle's claims that Russo had a family with the Castles. However, before Russo to execute Castle, Dinah Madani suddenly appeared and Russo managed to spin around and shot her directly in the head before she could stop and arrest him.

Furious upon seeing Dinah Madani seemingly being killed by Russo's gunshot, Punisher got up and, using the distraction to his advantage, charged at Russo. Punisher managed to pull Russo's gun away from him and tried to shoot him in the face, barely missing all the shots before Russo was able to throw away the gun. As the pair began to fight, Russo managed to knock the Punisher to the floor and kicked him repeatedly.

The pair had begun furiously throwing one another to the ground, as Castle hit Russo in the face and refused to allow him to get back up. Eventually, Russo was able to dodge one of Castle's blows, causing him to punch the ground as Russo managed to get up and continued the fight. Seeking to gain an advantage, Russo was able to draw his knife and began furiously slashing at Castle, cutting at his vest while attempting to cut a vital artery. However, the enraged Castle had still continued beating Russo down and had eventually managed to take the knife away from him, putting Russo back on the defense.

Castle managed to pin Russo against one of the mirrors, cracking it, as he attempted to plunge Russo's own knife into his eye socket. Using on his strength to keep him at bay, Russo then simply smiled at Castle as he used his hidden wrist blade to stab straight through Castle's arm, causing him intense agony. Throwing Castle away from him, Russo retook his own knife and then began attacking him with both blades, cutting into his arms several times before Castle was able to land a hard kick against Russo and attempted to then regain the upper hand against his former friend during the brutal fight.

Before long their clash ended as Russo had plunged the blade into Castle's shoulder and threw him against the mirror, cracking it even further and causing some largely broken shards to fall onto the floor. Getting right into the Castle's face, Russo told him to look at himself before he called him pathetic. Russo then pulled the blade out of Castle's shoulder and attempted to plunge it into his throat to finish him off, however, he failed to see Castle had picked a large piece of the broken mirror which he had then stabbed straight into Russo's stomach, causing a lot blood to pour out from Russo's wound.

Pulling a piece of the broken mirror out of his gut, Russo desperately attempted to defend himself but was in far too much agony, allowing Castle to beat him mercilessly and punch him straight into another mirror, cracking it. Unable to defend himself, Russo was grabbed by Castle and, to his utter horror, was dragged face first across a broken mirror, brutally ripping the side of his face apart as he screamed in agony. Enraged by the damage caused to his face, Russo attempted to attack Castle only to once again to smashed face first into another mirror as Russo fell to the ground, unable to move from the pain.

Russo being tormented by the Punisher
Castle forced Russo to look into his reflection in the broken mirror, as Russo saw all the horrific damage done to his once handsome face. Horrified by the sight of himself, Russo begged Castle to kill him as he held the shard of mirror onto Russo's throat. However, to Russo's horror, Castle then dropped the shard and claimed that he would not be killing him now, telling him that death would be too easy for him as he then proceeded to kick Russo face first into the broken mirror. Promising Russo would now learn about pain and about loss, Castle then grabbed Russo's hair and smashed his face into the mirror.

Russo is finally defeated by Frank Castle
While Russo's face was torn to shreds by being repeatedly smashed into the cracked mirror, Castle got down to his level and explained how each morning he searched for his wife and his two children and would realize that they were all gone forever. Castle told him that he wanted Russo to feel the same pain while he looked at his mangled face in the mirror each morning and remembered what he lost and that he would remember Castle doing it to him. Castle then smashed Russo's face directly into the mirror one last time, causing permanent and horrific scarring to him as Russo finally lost consciousness.

Russo's horrific facial wounds being treated
Russo then soon arrested once the New York City Police Department arrived on the scene and took him straight to the hospital, along with Madani who miraculously survived Russo's gunshot. Under the close watch of Marion James and Rafael Hernandez, Russo was then put into surgery and underwent eleven hours of work, seemingly saving his life. However, Russo went into a coma due to all of the trauma he had sustained from the fight, with the doctors unsure if he would ever regain consciousness again or if he would regain any higher level of brain function or any memory of his past life what so ever.

Painful Recovery
Krista Dumont's Treatment
Russo struggling to complete 20 push-ups
Following six weeks of treatment and multiple surgeries, Russo awoke from his coma, now without memories of his previous actions involving William Rawlins and the Massacre at Central Park, as he became confused about how he gained his facial scars. For his treatment, Russo was also assigned Krista Dumont as his personal therapist and was given a plain white mask to hide his facial scarring which greatly upset him. During treatment, Russo would attempt to get some exercise but would become frustrated as he could only do minimal pushups before having to stop.

Russo is frustrated by his current situation
Having been watching him, Dumont questioned how many pushups Russo could do while with the Marine Corps, to which Russo told a story of his recruiter who pushed his potential soldier's limits during training with pushups. Wiping his sweat while keeping his scarred face hidden, Russo complained about how he could no longer walk across a room without beginning to sweat, although Dumont insisted that Russo had already achieved a considerable amount during his six months of recovery, although Russo had remained unimpressed by the comment due to his frustration about his situation.

Russo compares Krista Dumont's metaphor
As Dumont had told him that he was being too harsh on himself and recommended that he hang in there, Russo laughed out loud as he compared this concept to a kitten hanging on a branch, mockingly demonstrating this with his hands. As Russo recalled having this as a poster back at Ray of Hope, he began to get confused as his head continued pounding. Dumont then changed the subject and asked if Russo was still seeing the Skull imagery in his dreams, which Russo had confirmed he was although he begged Dumont to not talk about those dreams as Russo began to have another mini panic attack.

Russo is told to decorate his white mask
Dumont was able to calm Russo down as she promised that they would continue breaking down the things that were causing him such distress piece by piece. With Russo now relaxed, Dumont told him how her other patients often used their white masks to present the person they wanted to be seen as and suggested that Russo try this, although Russo was unimpressed by the concept of decorating his mask. Since Dumont was serious about her suggestion, Russo had compared this to a kindergarten activity similar to finger painting and initially refused, although Dumont convinced him to reconsider.
