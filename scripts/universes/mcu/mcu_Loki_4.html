<html><p>Asgardian Dungeons: As punishment for the devastation he had caused on Earth, Loki was imprisoned in the Asgardian Dungeons by Odin. Loki did not share his cell with any other prisoner and was supposed to remain in custody for the rest of his life. When a prison break was orchestrated by Kurse, Loki was not released and remained reading in his cell while the Einherjar fought the prisoners. However, Loki was informed that Frigga had died, causing him to lay waste on the furniture in his cell. Loki was freed by Thor who needed his assistance to go to Svartalfheim.

Trivia
Loki (and his 2012 counterpart) is the first bisexual title character of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
In the non-canon comic Captain America & Thor: Avengers!, Loki helps his friends to free Fandral who is captured by the Dark Elves led by Alflyse.
In a promotional file of the TVA, posted by Loki's official account, Loki is described as of fluid sex, 6'4" height, blue eye color, 525 weight, black hair, and unknown race/ethnicity, date of birthday and age. The file later appeared in the show, in the first episode and the credits sequence.
Behind the Scenes
Tom Hiddleston, the actor who portrays Loki, originally auditioned for the role of Thor.
Charlie Cox auditioned for the role of Loki.
Loki is the first Marvel Cinematic Universe villain to appear in multiple films in the franchise, not counting appearances through photographs and archive footage.
Loki's death in Thor: The Dark World was initially intended to be genuine and permanent, having been part of the initial pitch. However, during test screenings, the audience refused to believe that Loki had died and was sure he would somehow return, leading the filmmakers to reshoot the ending for one in which Loki survives.
Tom Hiddleston originally filmed scenes for Avengers: Age of Ultron, in which Loki's Scepter plays a pivotal role. However, Hiddleston's scenes ended up being cut when Joss Whedon felt that the movie would be overstuffed.
Tom Hiddleston stated that as the ruler of Asgard since the end of Thor: The Dark World, four years prior to the events of Thor: Ragnarok, that "Loki has devoted most of his efforts to narcissistic self-glorification. Not so much on good governance".
Paul Lacovara, Mark Musashi, Douglas Robson, Harley Durst and Adam Lytle were stunt doubles for Tom Hiddleston in the role of Loki.
Brent Reichert and Freddie Andrews were stand-ins for Tom Hiddleston in the role of Loki.
Gene Arnold was a photo double for Tom Hiddleston in the role of Loki.
