<html><p>Mysterio's actions in the film are similar to his origins in the comics. In the comics, Mysterio is a former special effects man for movies, who wanted to ruin Spider-Man's reputation by framing him for crimes and then defeat him as a new superhero. In the film, Mysterio is a former employee of Tony Stark, who wants to replace the fallen hero as "the next Iron Man", using his illusions of the Elementals to stage his debut. Screenwriters Erik Sommers and Chris McKenna thus had to deal with the challenge of updating Mysterio for the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the post-Avengers: Endgame era.
Matt Damon reportedly turned down the role of Quentin Beck before Jake Gyllenhaal was cast. Damon previously portrayed an actor playing Loki in Thor: Ragnarok.
Matt Smith, Andrew Scott, and Colin Farrell were also considered for the role of Mysterio.
Gyllenhall himself had previously been considered for the role of Doctor Strange.
Early versions of the story of Spider-Man: Far From Home had Mysterio's status as a villain revealed from the beginning, being an out-and-out villain that Spider-Man and Nick Fury would chase around all Europe as he pulled off the Elementals threat. However, as Mysterio dealt so much in deception, Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers accepted that it was sort of natural that Mysterio's ruse would lead to a story structure where his entire identity was completely misleading. Another early idea involved Mysterio actually being a Skrull, but it was dropped.
When asked if Mysterio died at the end of Spider-Man: Far From Home, Jon Watts didn't rule out the possibility of Mysterio surviving by responding "It's Mysterio, so who knows?" yet commenting that for him, Mysterio seemed pretty dead. Producer Amy Pascal, when asked the same question, responded "You don't know". Jake Gyllenhaal also commented that for him, Mysterio is "a dead man".
James Cox, James Harris, Corbett McAllister and Timothy Eulich were stunt doubles for Jake Gyllenhaal in the role of Mysterio.
James Payton was a stand-in for Jake Gyllenhaal in the role of Mysterio.
