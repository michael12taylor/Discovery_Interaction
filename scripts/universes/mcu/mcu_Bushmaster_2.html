<html><p>Now knowing the news about Anansi's death, Bushmaster went to Gwen's and broke into the area where the massacre had occurred. Bushmaster looked over towards the blood puddles that were on the floor and was left upset from all that it took place. Bushmaster was then asked by Sheldon of what to do with Johnson and told him to let her go. As Johnson witnessed the aftermath of the massacre, Bushmaster expressed his gratitude over her, letting her leave after an apology. Looking down on the floor, Bushmaster picked up Anansi's piece of his belt buckle, mourning his death.

Bushmaster paying respect for Anansi's body
Showing up at the morgue, Bushmaster arrived inside to see Anansi's corpse and mourn his death, apologizing for what he had caused. When his aunt and Luke Cage arrived at the morgue, Bushmaster was going to fight Cage only to be stopped by Ingrid. Bushmaster then waited for his aunt out near a window shield and looked at her closely. With Cage by his side, Bushmaster thanked him for protecting his aunt, being told that it was the right thing to do. Bushmaster dismissed Cage's morals and told him that the world is a complicated place. Cage told Bushmaster to stop his quest to kill Dillard as he would be there to stop him.

Bushmaster thanking Luke Cage for his aunt
Expressing that his whole life was a pain, Bushmaster faced Cage and was told about being stopped to kill Dillard and one he turned around he was displeased that he could have taken Cage as his brethren. Respecting his opponent's conviction, Bushmaster simply replied to Cage that he did not look forward to killing him. After being told by Cage that he should be ready to run with his aunt, Bushmaster walked over to his aunt and hugged her, comforting her as they mourn the death of Anansi.

Battle at Yangsi Gonshi Warehouse
Bushmaster furiously confronts Hai-Qing Yang
As Hai-Qing Yang and Mariah Dillard left the Calderwood Auction House for a secret meeting, Yang calmly told Dillard that his security had believed that Bushmaster will be watching them. Once he spotted Yang out in the auction, Bushmaster followed Yang and hid in front of the Yangsi Gonshi Warehouse. Once he was hidden, Bushmaster personally confronted him as he was inspecting the heroin that was tainting his name. Furious with this revelation, Bushmaster told Yang that he was putting the poisonous heroin on the Harlem streets to make the people believe that it was him doing it.

Bushmaster joining up forces with Luke Cage
With him now exposed, Bushmaster noticed Yang's men were being suspicions with there movements and as Yang had provoked him, the members of the Yangsi Gonshi surrounded him, grabbing their guns as they prepared to gun him down. However, just before he was being fired at, Bushmaster was assisted by Luke Cage and handed him a car door to protect himself while using his unbreakable skin to deflect the gunshots. Entering inside of the warehouse, Bushmaster and Cage were followed by Yang's men and while they prepared, Bushmaster agreed with Cage to team up on the condition that if he kills anyone then he will be on his own.

Bushmaster fights against the Yangsi Gonshi
Bushmaster began fighting against Triad members and battled their way with their attempt to kill them with hatchets. Apprehending one of them, Bushmaster attempted to kill one the men only to hit Cage in the back, much to his irritation. As the battle continued, Bushmaster defeated Triad members above the warehouse's shelves and began to fight them on the ground. As their team-up had ended up destroying the Heroin's packages, Bushmaster and Cage defeated all of Triad members as they agreed upon always protecting their name.

Bushmaster furiously arguing with Luke Cage
As his anger grew, Bushmaster swore to revenge the Triad members who made the heroin and kill Dillard, angering Cage. As Cage questioned him for his murders, Bushmaster told him as long as they get in the way and equipped him Hammer Industries Explosive Charge, telling him he'll destroy the warehouse and that Cage won't have a choice. Bushmaster then defeated Cage and handed him the explosive, mush to his surprised. As the explosion started, Bushmaster escaped the warehouse as the evidence was intact.

Preparing for Revenge
Bushmaster visiting Tilda Johnson in the room
Being called by Tilda Johnson, Bushmaster entered a dislocated environment and greeted her accordingly. Bushmaster teased Johnson as if she misses him, having a chuckle as his friend Sheldon told him about an announcement. As Johnson told him about the confirmation of Mariah Dillard being the one who killed Anansi by setting him up on fire and shooting him dead, Bushmaster became furious with her for telling him this and was told that she needed to be taken down. Bushmaster listened on about how Dillard can't be quarantined so there must be another way and it is to confront her head-on.

Bushmaster being given a dose of Nightshade
Liking the prospect of killing Dillard, Bushmaster didn't want to attract attention from the guards to which Johnson decided to let him enter inside a backdoor room that leads to Harlem's Paradise. Once Johnson proposed the idea, Bushmaster was offered a dose of liquid Nightshade from a syringe that can be used in small amounts and was warned that it could destroy his mind and body if he takes it all at once. Just as Sheldon was worried for him, Bushmaster decided to take the risk for it for his mother, father, Anansi, and anyone close to him, taking the Nightshade and going through the plan to kill Dillard.

Bushmaster talking to Sheldon about the plan
Inside of his home with Sheldon, Bushmaster prepared himself for the upcoming plan, looking at the portraits of his family and picked out the one with his mother and him in it. As looked at the picture of his mother and mourning her death, Bushmaster put down the portrait and was given a jacket from Sheldon. Sheldon then asked Bushmaster about what he'll do without back up when there are too many guards. Bushmaster told him that if the guards at the club won't be a problem and will bring justice to his mother once the plan will go through.

Infiltration into Harlem's Paradise
Bushmaster meeting with Tilda Johnson

Bushmaster entered Dillard's secret basement and reached the security door, furiously starting to pound on it.

Bushmaster breaking down a steel door
As Bushmaster's anger and enhanced strength then allowed him to damage the door, Shades was given the Stokes' Revolver and Dillard had hidden behind him, as each blow was damaging the steel door. After angrily beating down the door with his fist, Bushmaster finally broke into the room with a charging kick and began confronting Dillard. As the bullet was shot, Bushmaster avoided Shades' attempt to kill him before disarming and throwing him across the room. Before Bushmaster could assassinate Dillard, he was attacked by Cage and Knight and began battling with them simultaneously.

As he was killing Dillard, Bushmaster was hit in the head by Knight's Prosthetic Arm and swiftly kicked her off across the room for her interference. Bushmaster was then caught off guard by Cage as he began to punch him hard enough to knock him out and put him in a chokehold.

Seeing how urgent it getting for Bushmaster, Tilda Johnson gave medicine for Bushmaster to drink to help him with his memory, drinking the cup in full.

Bushmaster grabbed Johnson's arm and told her that Dillard must burn, saying that it was the only way before left the shop to rest. Once they left the shop, Bushmaster and his had been handed Anansi's body and ordered a coffin back at home for his proper burial.

At night at the open view of a dislocated street, Bushmaster was in aid with his aunt and Sheldon. When their van stopped by to meet with Tilda Johnson, Bushmaster began to be carried out from outside and taken into another van. As they were ready to bury Anansi from the back of the van, Bushmaster looked at Sheldon who was staying in New York City to stay put and let him leave Jamaica. Bushmaster send a farewell with his aunt and returned home and bury his uncle out of respect for his death, succeeding his expectations for being at the top of the hill.

Personality
After witnessing the death of his mother and barely surviving an attempt on his own life, John McIver became heavily fixated on revenge against the Stokes Crime Family. His vendetta against the Stokes, Mariah Dillard in particular, was so strong he frequently insisted on referring to her by her maiden name whenever mentioned. Despite his obsession with revenge and brutal methods, he had a great deal of respect for his close friends and remaining family, namely his aunt Ingrid and uncle Anansi.

McIver was also very proud of his Jamaican heritage, being particular defensive of Usain Bolt after it was commented that Luke Cage was faster than Bolt. He even implied that he had attacked Cage purely to prove his inferiority for the comment.

Regardless of his rage and ruthless demeanor, McIver showed both an envious side and a respectful side in regards to Cage. McIver disliked his reputation in Harlem, stating he wanted to win Harlem's heart which Cage has. However, he was not unwilling to cooperate with Cage, even stating they could've been friends, pointing out parallels between them and even having a mutual understanding over wanting to stop gangs using their names as branding for street drugs.

Despite this, McIver was shown to be willing to use underhand tactics to beat Cage such as paralyzing him with a drug and despite his apparent willingness to not kill any Yangsi Gonshi members due to teaming up with Cage, he did attempt a lethal blow on one but was blocked by Cage. He also showed gratitude towards Cage for saving Ingrid Mackintosh and towards Tilda Johnson for saving him. In fact, Sheldon and he once considered killing Johnson upon discovering her relation to the Stokes family, but their mutual hatred of Dillard had created a friendship between the two where McIver thanked her for her help and requested that she waits for him when he attempts to assassinate her mother for the greater good.

Powers and Abilities
Powers

After taking an enhanced strain of nightshade, Bushmaster was able to effectively overpower Luke, as well as break down a steel door with multiple blows that damaged it severely from the outside.
Superhuman Durability: After inhaling his first nightshade, McIver's skin was hardened, making him far more resilient than a normal human.
