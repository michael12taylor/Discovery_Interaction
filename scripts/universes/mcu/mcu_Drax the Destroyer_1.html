Drax is a former Kylosian intergalactic criminal and a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. He sought revenge on Ronan the Accuser for killing his wife and daughter, and went on a rampage across the galaxy, ending with him being imprisoned by the Nova Corps in the Kyln. There, Drax became uneasy allies with Star-Lord, Gamora, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot. Together, they broke out of the Kyln and became embroiled in the Quest for the Orb. After the Battle of Xandar, in which he finally exacted his vengeance on Ronan, Drax left Xandar with the other Guardians but not before declaring Thanos as his next target.

Following the Guardians, Drax assisted in killing the Abilisk for the Sovereign people, only for Rocket Raccoon to betray them. Drax followed the Guardians as they encountered Ego, the long lost father of Star-Lord. Along the way, he developed a close bond with Mantis, who soon revealed that Ego's true plan was to destroy and rebuild the entire universe. Drax and his fellow Guardians defeated Ego, saving the galaxy once more but at the cost of Yondu Udonta's self-sacrifice.

Four years later, the Guardians of the Galaxy joined up with Thor and the Avengers in trying to stop Thanos from obtaining the Infinity Stones. When Thanos gathered all of the stones, he used them to eradicate half the universe's population, including Drax and the Guardians, except Rocket Raccoon and Nebula. Five years after the Snap, the remaining Avengers successfully gathered the Infinity Stones from different points in the past and Hulk resurrected the victims of the Snap, restoring Drax back to life. He then participated and survived the Battle of Earth, attended Tony Stark's funeral, and rejoined the Guardians of the Galaxy.

Biography
Early Life
Forming a Family
Drax comes from the Kylosian people, a race of primitives who are considered naive and hopelessly underdeveloped by the more advanced galactic groups. As a result, Drax is extremely unaware of basic concepts such as metaphors and customs. They are, however, a fierce and capable warrior race who follow a tribal-like culture.

During his youth, Drax's father would tell the story of the night he had impregnated Drax's mother with him, something Drax found beautiful. While attending a war rally with his people, Drax met a woman named Ovette, falling in love with her due to her lack of joy at the festivities, and together had a daughter named Kamaria.

Quest for Vengeance
Hunting Ronan the Accuser
Drax the Destroyer is imprisoned in the Kyln
Under the order of the warlord Thanos, Ronan the Accuser subjected Kylos to the same treatment as Zen-Whoberi: the population was randomly divided into two parts, and one of them was slaughtered. Drax was put on the side which survived, but Ovette and Kamaria were murdered with the rest. Drax was driven into a path of vengeance and went on a bloody rampage across the galaxy in search of the murderous Kree, gaining a reputation as one of the most dangerous beings in the galaxy and earning the nickname, The Destroyer. After over twenty-two counts of murder and five counts of grievous bodily harm, he was arrested by the Nova Corps and brought to the Kyln.

Meeting the Guardians
Drax learns Gamora has arrived at the Kyln
As Drax served his sentence in the Kyln, he witnessed the arrival of Gamora, the adopted daughter of Thanos and who had been working for Ronan the Accuser. As Gamora was threatened by the other inmates, many of whom had lost their own families to Ronan's wars, Drax sat quietly and waited for the right moment to gain his revenge and kill Gamora in order to hurt Ronan.

Drax discovers both Moloka Dar and Gamora
That night, Drax found Moloka Dar dragging Gamora into the shower rooms with some other inmates with the intention of cutting her throat. Drax, however, appeared and warned them all to stop what they were doing, making it clear how Ronan had murdered both Ovette and Kamaria and therefore he felt he was the one who had to kill Gamora. Dar was clearly terrified of Drax and willingly handed over his own knife to the destroyer to then kill Gamora.

Drax attempts to execute Gamora
Drax explained that as Ronan had killed his family, he intended to kill one of Ronan's daughters. Gamora, however, disarmed Drax and Dar, killing the other inmate and threatening them both while noting that she was no daughter of either Thanos or Ronan and in fact was the only hope of stopping them. Drax ignored Gamora's claims and gripped her by the throat, insisting that this changed nothing as he prepared to violently kill her to gain some satisfaction.

Drax reluctantly accepting Star-Lord's idea
Before Drax could have his revenge, he was interrupted by Star-Lord and Rocket Raccoon, who insisted that Drax keep Gamora alive in order to draw Ronan to the Kyln where he could destroy the man who killed his family. Despite some miscommunication, Drax eventually agreed that this was the best plan and reluctantly freed Gamora from his grasp. Before he departed to return to his cell, Drax informed Dar he was now keeping the knife for himself.

Prison Break
Drax witnesses the prison riot breaking out
The next day, Drax witnessed Groot stealing a Quardrix battery from the middle of the Kyln, which almost immediately caused the entire prison to go straight into emergency mode and the guards to rush in to pacify the inmates. As Drax stood by and watched, Groot grew to an incredible size and battled against the security hoverbots, with Rocket Raccoon on his back, while chastising him over his foolish actions. When Drax saw the guards preparing to shoot at Rocket Raccoon and Groot, Drax had then made the split second decision that he would assist them so he could also escape from the Kyln.

Drax during the sudden escape from the Kyln
Drax fought a number of guards and easily knocked all of them out, laughing hysterically as he did as he had enjoyed the sense of battle. Once the guards were defeated, Drax threw a machine gun to Rocket who used it to shoot at the hoverbots. Drax later assisted Peter Quill by ripping a security drone apart with his bare hands, before he called out Quill for his story of sleeping with an A'askavariian while he climbed up the side of Groot to finally escape from the prison.

Drax awaits Rocket Raccoon's escape plan
The five prisoners locked themselves in the security watchtower, leading to a confrontation between Drax and Gamora, who was horrified that Drax was with them while Rocket mocked their new teammate for his lack of understanding of metaphors. Rocket then initiated his plan. He switched off the prison's artificial gravity, took control of the hoverbots, and used them to propel the watchtower room out of the cell block to make their escape.

Drax watching Star-Lord flying through space
Once they reclaimed their belongings, the group was ordered to wait in Star-Lord's spaceship while he completed one final task. As they waited in the Milano for Quill, Gamora realized that he had taken the Orb with him and therefore they could not leave without him. While Rocket panicked that soon the Nova Corps would arrive and shoot them out of the sky, Drax looked out of the window and was the first to see Quill coming towards them, using his helmet to keep him alive as he jetted through space with his boots and rejoined the others.

Drax rudely calling Star-Lord an imbecile
Drax was greatly impressed by Quill's bravery in successfully fighting off the Nova Corps guards and having returned to the ship in such spectacular style, complimenting his new ally as he pulled him onto the ship. Drax questioned what had made Quill depart on his brief mission, but was horrified when he discovered that Quill was simply retrieving his Walkman Headset, looking up at Quill and calling him an imbecile for risking his life for something so minor.

Joining the Team
Drax, Gamora and Peter Quill discuss the Orb
While traveling in the Milano, the team discussed their next move and who they intended to sell the Orb to. Drax suggested that if it was a weapon they should use it to kill Ronan the Accuser which led to an argument between him and Gamora. Before they could begin fighting, Peter Quill broke them apart and suggested that they concentrate on getting paid, to which Drax claimed to have no interest in money as it did not help him in his goal to kill Ronan.

Drax overlooks Knowhere as they arrive
Drax and the rest of the group traveled to Knowhere to deliver the Orb to Taneleer Tivan, to whom Gamora had agreed to sell the Orb. As they approached the city, Drax was amazed by the incredible structure, which Gamora explained had been built out of the severed head of an ancient celestial being and warning that the people there were not to be trusted. While walking about, Drax and Quill discussed Earth, with Drax noting he would like to visit.

Drax gets drunk and bets on Orloni fights
While they waited for Tivan; Drax, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot went to the nearby Boot of Jemiah, where both Drax and Rocket ended up getting drunk and betting on some Orloni fights. For a while, Drax and Rocket appeared to get along and even shared laughs together. Taking a break from the drinking and laughing, Drax explained the stories behind his many markings on his skin, however, this eventually led to the pair beginning an argument about mourning.

Drax and Rocket Raccoon attack each other
Their argument soon led to Drax and Rocket getting into a fight after Drax insulted Rocket's rodent-like appearance. Groot tried to help Rocket, but Drax attacked him and pinned him down where he proceeded hit him repeatedly, prompting Rocket to draw a Laser Cannon and prepare to shoot Drax with it. Luckily, Quill came and stopped the drunken Rocket, convincing him to let it slide until they had gotten their money. In a rage, Drax left the bar. After he left, the rest of the group was finally summoned by Tivan.

Drax decides to contact Ronan the Accuser
While stalking through Knowhere in frustration at his team's inability to work together for his goal of destroying Ronan the Accuser, Drax looked down the street and came across the Knowhere Dispatcher at the Tivan Dispatch Center. Sneaking up on the dispatcher while he was ordering supplies, Drax threatened to cut off his head with twin blades and forced him to call Ronan and bring him to Knowhere so that he could kill him and finally avenge his family.

Showdown with Ronan
Skirmish on Knowhere
Drax challenges Ronan the Accuser
While the rest of the group discovered that inside the Orb was one of the Infinity Stones powerful enough to destroy a planet, Drax got his knives ready as Ronan the Accuser arrived, prepared to destroy his enemy. While Drax confronted Ronan about the murder of his wife and daughter and his desire for revenge, he intended to gain by killing Ronan.

Drax battles against Ronan the Accuser
Although Ronan attempted to just walk away, not seeing Drax as a worthy opponent, Drax refused to allow his enemy to get away and charged at him, with Ronan very casually dodging Drax's blows while he continued giving his orders to Nebula to reclaim the Orb from Drax's allies who were attempting to escape. Despite all of Drax's attempts to kill the far stronger Kree soldier, Ronan the Accuser was able to overpower Drax, throwing him around with ease.

Drax is defeated by Ronan the Accuser
Despite all of Drax's efforts as he pounded at Ronan's Kree Armor, he was unable to do any notable damage to his foe, who was able to finally overpower and defeat Drax, choking him and throwing his body to the ground with minimal effort. Ronan dismissed Drax's claims of murdering his family, claiming he did not remember them and would not remember killing him either, with Drax now too beaten and weak to even stand and defend his family's honor.

Drax is saved from drowning by Groot
Once Drax had been easily subdued by Ronan with little effort, he was dragged across the street by his foot before being thrown into a tank full of spinal fluid from the Celestial and left to die, all while Ronan calmly returned to a Necrocraft which took him back to the Dark Aster as Nebula had reclaimed the Orb from Gamora. Drax nearly drowned in the tank, but Groot pulled him out just in time and resuscitated him by stabbing Drax in the chest.

Drax agrees to save Star-Lord and Gamora
Outside of Knowhere, Gamora was nearly killed by Nebula, and the Orb was retaken by Ronan. Peter Quill summoned the Yondu Ravager Clan to assist, and they ended up capturing him and Gamora. Drax was blamed by Rocket Raccoon for Quill and Gamora's kidnapping, and Drax realized that he used anger just to hide his pain. However, he got no sympathy from Rocket, who intended to escape to the other side of the galaxy to avoid Ronan's wrath. Drax, however, stood by Groot and chose to rescue Quill and Gamora.

Rescuing Peter Quill
Drax using the Hadron Enforcer
Hoping to save Star-Lord and Gamora, the three flew to the Eclector in the Milano, planning to destroy the Ravagers' ship with the Hadron Enforcer if they did not hand over Quill and Gamora in five seconds. Right before they were going to destroy the ship, Quill used the Ravagers' communication system to tell Rocket Raccoon that he had managed to come up with a deal for Yondu Udonta.

Drax discusses the next move to get the Orb
With Quill and Gamora back on the ship, they began discussing what their next move would be in order to get the Orb back. When Drax attempted to make a comment, Gamora told him not to speak after the disaster he caused on Knowhere by calling Ronan the Accuser in order to try and battle him. When Drax argued he should get credit for saving Quill, he was reminded that his attempt to save him had involved threatening to blow up the ship he was on.

Drax agrees to join Peter Quill into battle
Eventually, Quill pitched his plan to attack the Dark Aster, kill Ronan the Accuser and take back the Orb, although the plan seemed like a suicide mission, Drax stood by Quill and vowed to fight with him, noting that once the battle was over and they had all been killed, he would be reunited with his wife and daughter, leading to all the other Guardians of the Galaxy standing with him and agreeing to fight in order to save Xandar and defeat Ronan once and for all.

Drax joins Yondu Udonta's Ravagers
It didn't take long for the rest of the team to agree to help as well and they went back to the Ravagers' ship to discuss the details of the plan with Udonta and his men. When Kraglin Obfonteri noted that there would be hundreds of Sakaarans onboard the ship willing to fight for Ronan, Drax noted that he viewed the Sakaarans as nothing more than paper people, this pleased Obfonteri who punched Drax in the shoulder, which caused Drax to look at him in rage.

Drax prepares for the upcoming battle
With the plan ready to go into action, Drax put on his new uniform and readied his knives to go into battle with his friends in order to save Xandar from almost certain destruction at the hands of Ronan and his army, with Drax joining Quill, Gamora and Groot onboard the Milano which would board the Dark Aster in order to confront Ronan while Rocket had his own ship and led the Ravagers in the upcoming aerial battle against the army of Sakaaran soldiers.

Battle of Xandar
Drax flies into the battle with his new allies
The next day, Star-Lord's team and the Ravagers put the plan into action and Quill warned Rhomann Dey so that he could tell the rest of the Nova Corps. As the battle began, Drax rode with Quill, Gamora and Groot towards the Dark Aster. However, they were quickly attacked by swarms of Necrocraft sent by Ronan the Accuser, who overwhelmed them, even managing to shoot Yondu Udonta's battleship out of the sky.

Drax celebrates as he flies into battle
Just before they could all be destroyed, however, the Nova Corps arrived, led by Garthan Saal under the orders of Irani Rael. While Saal and Rocket Raccoon kept Ronan's entire army at bay with the aid of the Ravagers, Star-Lord flew the Milano onto the Dark Aster through a hole blasted in by Rocket. As they crash landed into the ship, Drax could not hold back his glee and cheered with delight as Quill used the ships' guns to kill dozens of the Sakaarans inside.

Drax apologizes for his more recent mistakes
Once they landed and left the crashed ship, they discovered that the Dark Aster was too dark for them to see so Groot used his powers to create a strange light across the ship to show them the way, when Drax questioned how he could do it, Star-Lord noted the answer would likely be "I am Groot." As they made their way across the ship, Drax apologized to the group for his past mistakes and expressed his gratitude at having their new found friendship.

Drax shoots Nebula for dishonoring his allies
They were suddenly stopped by Nebula who attempted to kill the Guardians of the Galaxy, as she cursed at Gamora for betraying Ronan and Thanos, Drax shot her with his rocket launcher, claiming no one should speak to his friends like that. With the threat of Nebula seemingly dealt with the team, they split up: With Gamora going to unlock the security doors while Drax, Star-Lord and Groot made their way through the Sakaaran army towards Ronan's location.

Skirmish with Korath
Drax battles Sakaaran soldiers
As they battled their way towards Ronan the Accuser, killing several Sakaarans who got in their way, they were eventually confronted by a team led by Korath the Pursuer, who attempted to kill Star-Lord in order to prevent any of them from getting close to Ronan. While Drax battled the small army of Sakaaran soldiers, using both of his knives to rip them apart, Star-Lord was forced to battle the far stronger Korath, who easily overpowered the human despite his best efforts to keep fighting.

Drax brutally kills Korath the Pursuer
Once he had killed the soldiers, Drax then came to Quill's aid and personally engaged in a fierce battle against the strong Kree soldier. Eventually, Drax managed to pin his new enemy against a wall and proceeded to slay Korath by ripping out one of his cranial implants, electrocuting him to death before making a comment to Quill about whether or not he had successfully said a metaphor by remarking that a finger to the throat was the symbol of death.

Drax watches Groot slaughter their enemies
Just as Star-Lord considered correcting Drax on the meaning of a metaphor, they were attacked by another large team of Sakaarans sent by Ronan. Before they could engage in another battle against the soldier, Drax and Star-Lord then witnessed Groot massacre the entire team of Sakaarans with minimal effort as he extended his arm and impaled the soldiers. As Groot smashed the soldiers from wall to wall, Drax could not contain his glee at the slaughter.

Drax mistakenly thinks Ronan is dead
As they continued toward, they discovered that the door was still locked due to Gamora being busy battling against Nebula. Before long, however, the door was opened and the team charged inside to confront the Kree warmonger. Finding Ronan, the group attempted to kill him with the Hadron Enforcer, which caused a massive explosion, much to Drax's delight. Ronan, however, survived and used his own hammer, the Cosmi-Rod to knock back the team.

Drax is choked by Ronan the Accuser
Still unwilling to allow Ronan to win, Drax charged forward to attack him, only for the powerful Kree to grab him by the throat and hold him high in the air, once again mocking Drax by noting how pitiful he found his wife and daughter's screams to be. Before Ronan could finish the group, Rocket Raccoon suddenly crashed his ship through the Dark Aster and into both Ronan and Drax, causing both vehicles critical damage and almost killing Drax in the process.

Drax is saved from an explosion by Groot
Drax was knocked unconscious in the crash and it clearly became clear that the Dark Aster had lost all power and was crashing. In order to save his allies from certain death, Groot created a dome of wood out of his body, which would protect the team when the Dark Aster crashed into Xandar. Despite Rocket's insistence that Groot try and save himself when the ship crashed, the team were all saved, but Groot's body was pulverized into pieces.

Destroying Ronan
Drax shoots Ronan with the Hadron Enforcer
Just the team recovered from the crash landing, it was discovered that Ronan the Accuser had also survived the crash as he prepared to destroy Xandar with the Infinity Stone. In a final desperate attempt to stop him, Star-Lord distracted Ronan while Rocket Raccoon and Drax then used the Hadron Enforcer to blast Ronan's Cosmi-Rod, exposing the Power Stone contained inside.

Drax absorbs some of the Orb's power
Quill quickly grabbed the stone but was nearly killed by its power. Gamora helped him by taking his hand and spreading the burden between the two of them. Drax did the same by grabbing onto Quill's shoulder, with Rocket Raccoon following suite by gripping Drax's finger. Stabilizing the stone's power long enough to direct it towards Ronan, the four obliterated him and then resealed the stone back into a new orb-like device, freeing them from its power.

Drax comforts Rocket after Groot's "death"
With Ronan now dead and Quill having given a fake Orb to Yondu Udonta and his Ravagers so they could give the true Orb to the Nova Corps for safe-keeping, Drax walked over to Rocket Raccoon, who was mourning the death of his dear friend Groot. Seeing no other way to comfort his new friend, Drax simply sat next to him and stroked his fur, which seems to relax him as they sat in the wreckage of Xandar while the people looked on in amazement.

Guardian of the Galaxy
Joining the Team
Drax vows he will destroy Thanos next
After the battle, the stone was given to the Nova Corps and Drax realized that Ronan the Accuser was sent by Thanos to kill his family, and vowed to kill Thanos next, informing Gamora of his intentions had also learned from Irani Rael new information about Star-Lord's father who was not from Earth as Star-Lord had long believed.

Drax speaks to Denarian Rhomann Dey
As they stepped outside, Rhomann Dey presented Star-Lord and the rest of the team the now newly restored Milano as a thank you from saving their lives during the Battle of Xandar. Dey warned the team that while their criminal records had been deleted, they still could not commit any crimes. Drax questioned this concept by asking if he could rip out a man's spine if he annoys him, to which Dey reminded him that murder was illegal and he would not be allowed.

Drax prepares for his next adventure
Having boarded the Milano with the rest of his new teammates and friends, Drax traveled around the universe with Quill's team, which became known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, with Drax nodding to Rocket Raccoon who was holding a twig from Groot's body which he had planted to regrow his greatest friend. As they prepared to leave Xandar, Quill questioned if they should next do something good or bad before deciding they should do a bit of both.

Drax cleans his knives while Groot dances
The twig that Rocket had managed to save from Groot's body soon allowed Groot to grow into a new body, although slowly as he began tidy as he slowly grew back. Once in the Milano, after Groot had grown a little bit bigger, he began to dance to "I Want You Back" by The Jackson 5 behind Drax as he cleaned and sharpened his knives. Whenever Drax would look in Groot's direction, he would freeze until Drax looked away, leaving Drax still none the wiser to the silliness that was currently occurring just behind his back.

Battle on Sovereign
Drax awaits the arrival of the Abilisk
After the Battle of Xandar, the Guardians of the Galaxy became well known across the galaxy. The Sovereign hired the Guardians to take down the Abilisk that was eating the Anulax Batteries. When the Guardians arrived on the planet, Gamora questioned Drax as of why he wasn't wearing one of Rocket's Aero-Rigs, which he told her it made his nipples hurt. Quill asked Rocket what he was setting up. When Drax heard that Rocket was setting up a speaker system, he told Rocket that he thought it was a terrible idea.

Drax allows himself to be eaten by the Abilisk
The Abilisk arrived and Drax leaped into battle with the rest of his team as Groot began dancing to music, when Drax was knocked back landed next to Groot, Groot froze to Drax's confusion, the latter of whom simply got to his feet and returned to the battle. As the fighting resumed, Drax found that the Abilisk's skin was too strong to be penetrated before he was knocked back a second time, with him landing on the speakers, angering Groot, who began attempting to hit Drax for stopping the music.

Drax breaks out of the Abilisk's stomach
Drax then informed Gamora that the Abilisk must be cut on the inside as its hide was too thick to penetrate. While Gamora tried to explain to him not to do that because it would not work, Drax grabbed his twin knives and jumped inside its mouth and began hacking away at its organs. When the Guardians finally killed the creature, Drax fell out of its wound, laughing that he had killed the beast, with the rest of the Guardians giving him angry looks for taking the credit.

Escape from the Sovereign Fleet
Drax and the Guardians meet Ayesha
Drax joined the other Guardians of the Galaxy in greeting Ayesha in the wake of their victory over the Abilisk, as Ayesha gave them their prize for defeating the beast, handing over Nebula whom they intended to hand over to the Nova Corps. As they were leaving, Rocket Raccoon mocked Ayesha before revealing to Drax that he had stolen the Anulax Batteries, causing Drax to laugh out loud.

Drax offers Star-Lord some romance advice
Back onboard the Milano, Drax witnessed Peter Quill attempting to flirt with Gamora and failing, so he decided to offer his own opinions. Drax told Quill that he should not pursue Gamora, noting that there were only two types of beings in the universe, those who danced and those who did not, explaining this was why they should not be together. Drax then went on to tell the story of how he first met Ovette and how he fell in love with her as she refused to dance to even the most enjoyable song just like he would.

Drax and the team are attacked by Sovereign
During the flight, however, they were suddenly attacked from behind and realized it was the Sovereign, seeking revenge for the Guardians having stolen the Batteries from them, which Drax then inadvertently revealed to the others, much to Rocket's great annoyance. As Quill attempted to fly away from the incoming horde of Omnicrafts, he and Rocket got into an argument about who should fly the ship while Drax protected Groot from being sucked out of the ship. As the chase continued through an asteroid field, the outnumbered Guardians were aided by Ego who quickly destroyed hundreds Omnicrafts with a single powerful attack.

Drax attempts to shoot Zylak's spaceship
Despite Ego destroying the majority of the fleet, Drax soon realized that Zylak was still shooting at them. Taking one of the Holographic Space Suits, Drax stepped out of the Milano in mid-flight with a gun and attempted to shoot Zylak's Omnicraft out of the sky himself, eventually succeeding although he then found he could not get back into the Milano to safety as it quickly began losing control and crash landing.

Drax celebrates surviving the crashlanding
As the Milano fell towards Berhert, Drax remained trapped outside as Gamora desperately tried to pull him to safety. Eventually, the ship hit the ground and was torn apart by the impact, with Drax being flung away and hitting the ground hard. However, Drax's own super-human strength allowed him to survive the impact as he got onto his knees and celebrated the victory, yelling out insults to the Sovereign as he laughed and cheered about the victory. He then regrouped with the other Guardians who were arguing about the crash.

Meeting Ego
Drax watches Gamora and Star-Lord argue
Having crash landed, Drax watched as Gamora had begun confronting both Rocket Raccoon and Star-Lord over all their own involvement in the crash, blaming them for causing it by challenging each other. During the argument, Drax interrupted by attempting to correct Star-Lord's pronunciation of Anulax Batteries although Star-Lord still insisted that he was incorrect. When Star-Lord called Rocket a trash panda, Rocket asked Drax what it meant while Drax admitted he did not know while Star-Lord hinted it was.

Drax witnesses the sudden arrival of Ego
While Gamora was still furious at the entire situation, they discussed how it was possible that Ayesha's entire army of Sovereign ships were suddenly destroyed by another person's ship which Rocket described as three inches tall. Before they could discuss this further, the group were interrupted by the sudden arrival of Ego's Ship, with Drax questioning if this was the man Rocket had mentioned. Arming himself, Drax watched as Ego left the ship before introducing himself as Star-Lord's long lost father, much to their surprise.

Drax teaches Mantis the concept of jokes
As they sat around the fire and listened to Ego explaining how he had been searching for Star-Lord, ever since Yondu Udonta had failed to bring him back to him as required. Drax questioned his belief that Udonta had been Star-Lord's father, noting that they looked identical despite Udonta's blue skin. Mantis then spoke with Drax, attempting to smile before Drax then taught her the concept of jokes by letting her pet Rocket who then bit her, much to Drax's amusement.

Drax was then invited to come to Ego's Planet to discuss the matter more along with Star-Lord and Gamora, leaving Nebula behind with Rocket and Groot while Rocket was attempting to repair all of the damage done to the Milano during their crash landing. Drax chose to pack several large bags with his belongings, telling Star-Lord that he did not trust Rocket and Groot to be alone with his stuff. They then left the planet of Berhert onboard Ego's own Ship.

Drax and Star-Lord speak with Mantis
While flying through space towards his planet, Drax watched as Ego was put to sleep by Mantis. Drax later sat down with Star-Lord and Mantis as they discussed a bet they had made in regards to Mantis' antennas and their purpose which Drax now believed they were for protecting her from low leveled doors. Mantis explained that she is an Empath and can read people's feelings, meaning Drax had lost his bet to Star-Lord, much to his own great disappointment.

Drax and Mantis laugh at Star-Lord's expense
Mantis demonstrated this power to them both by using her abilities to sense that Star-Lord felt a strong sexual love for Gamora, causing Drax to burst out laughing out loud at his own friend's expense, with Mantis touching Drax's skin to also feel Drax's remarkable joy at the situation. Although Gamora still refused to get involved with the discussion and did not allow Mantis to touch her skin, they went on to discuss how Mantis could use her powers to help Ego to sleep for long journeys like this, using this power on Drax who instantly fell backward, sound asleep while snoring loudly.

Exploring Ego's Planet
Drax exploring Ego's Planet
Drax arrived on Ego's Planet with Peter Quill, Gamora and Mantis and was instantly captivated. He immediately noted the world's humility, believing it be a personal trait of his. Upon touching the bubbles that surrounded the vessel, Drax burst into laughter; again illustrating one of his more childish sides. 

Ego explains his origins to the Guardians
Ego discussed his history to the Guardians of the Galaxy as a Celestial, highlighting how his power left him desiring to mean; requiring him to create human avatars. Drax questioned if Ego made himself a penis, to the disgust of Quill and Gamora. Appearing genuinely dismayed, Drax queried how a planet could have intercourse with a human woman. With no delicacy, Drax revealed that his father would recount the story of his own conception every winter solstice. He concluded this debate with Quill by suggesting that he was too troubled about discussing reproducing.

Bonding with Mantis
Drax discusses his own family with Mantis
During his stay on Ego's Planet, Drax spent time with Mantis. Mantis revealed that she was an orphan when Ego found her and chose to raise her by hand. Ever inquisitive, Drax asked if she was instead a pet; and was confused as to why Ego would choose a hideous pet. Drax assured Mantis that looking horrifying was a good thing, as she would be loved for who she is. Drax noted that the pools on Ego's planet reminded him of those found on his homeworld, and the times he spent with his daughter there. He compared his daughter to Mantis, stating that they shared the same innocence.

Drax grieves over his family
Mantis then used her abilities to feel Drax's emotions and was overwhelmed by the grief and sadness that she found. Drax remained unmoved. Troubled with guilt, Mantis said that she had something to tell Drax, but was interrupted by Gamora. Drax and Gamora were shown to their quarters by Mantis, who insisted that she had nothing to say to Drax before Gamora interrupted her. Drax and Gamora shared suspicion about Mantis' claim.

Mantis' Confession
Drax listens to Mantis' warning
Drax was suddenly woken up by Mantis, who could bear her guilt no longer. Thinking that Mantis was sexually interested in him, Drax apologized for not being attracted to her. He stated that he preferred a woman with 'meat on her bones'. Drax almost threw up at the thought of having intimate relations with her. Offended, Mantis stated that she wasn't attracted to Drax's species; a suggestion he found offensive. Having had enough of his bickering, Mantis exclaimed that Drax and his friends were in danger.

Drax declares that the Guardians are a family
The pair left Drax's quarters and began speaking in the corridor, only to be interrupted by Gamora once again. Gamora's suspicions turned violent as she attacked Mantis, demanding to know what Ego really wanted. Drax retaliated by demanding that Gamora release her from her grasp. Drax then revealed to Gamora that Mantis had already told him everything. Upon Nebula's suggestion that they abandon Peter Quill to his fate, Drax announced that they were family; and would leave no one behind.

Battle on Ego's Planet
Drax arrives in order to save Star-Lord
Drax and his fellow Guardians of the Galaxy rushed to the palace to save Peter Quill from being used as a battery as a part of Ego's Expansion. Drax kicked the palace doors down just as Yondu Udonta and Rocket Raccoon's industrial craft collided straight into Ego, releasing Quill from Ego's grip. The Guardians boarded Udonta's craft and decided that in order to prevent Ego's conquest of the universe, they would have to destroy him. Quill and Udonta piloted the craft to the center of the planet in an effort to destroy Ego's brain.

Meanwhile, the Sovereign's fleet entered Ego's orbit to eliminate the Guardians of the Galaxy. In their attack, the fleet managed to knock Drax, Gamora, and Mantis out of the craft and onto the surface of Ego's core. As Ego grew more powerful, Drax suggested that Mantis put her former master back to sleep. Mantis rejected Drax, stating that Ego was too powerful for her abilities, as the light cracks through the surface of the planet.

Drax motivates Mantis for her bravery
Seeing that her lack of confidence, Drax proclaimed that Mantis didn't need faith in herself on stopping Ego from attacking because he believed in her. As Ego began to face them and attack, Mantis listened to Drax and places her hand on the ground, successfully commanded Ego to sleep. Relieved at her accomplishment, Drax admitted toward Gamora that he didn't believe she could do it, given how weak and skinny she was.

Drax and the Guardians of the Galaxy unite
The Guardians regrouped on the surface of Ego's core where Mantis was knocked unconscious by debris, which Drax told her to look before she was conscious. After Ego was released from his temporary sleep, Drax picked up Mantis as the planet began collapsing around them and given Star-Lord's Aero-Rigs to fly to the extraction point, taking Mantis with him. Kraglin Obfonteri met Drax and Mantis at the extraction point in the Quadrant, which was quickly overpowered by Ego. As Ego's power returned, Drax sank into the planet, fighting to stay above the ground, keeping Mantis above the rising dirt. 

Drax asking Rocket where Peter Quill is
As Quill used his abilities to fight against his father, Ego's hold on the Guardians ceased, and the dirt consuming Drax plummeted. Finally, Drax carried the unconscious Mantis into the Ravager ship and to safety. Rocket commanded Obfonteri to take off, to the objection of Drax who repeatedly demanded to know where Quill was. As the Guardians flew into orbit, Udonta gave Quill his Space Suit and aero-rig, sacrificing himself and dying in the vacuum of space.

During which, Drax and Rocket Raccoon shared a confused look when Quill mentioned David Hasselhoff. Noticing out in space, Drax watched as the remaining Ravagers gave Udonta a traditional Ravager funeral for his final farewell. Groot yawned in Gamora's arms and sought the comfort of Drax, who patted him to sleep. Mantis stood in awe of the funeral, admiring its beauty. Drax added that she was beautiful too, on the inside.

Drax gets stabbed by a Yaka Arrow
When Drax was sitting in a room alone, Kraglin Obfonteri experimented with the Yaka Arrow Controller, trying to take control of it with a whistle. Once he succeeds in using the arrow with him by constantly whistling, Obfonteri accidentally fired Udonta's Yaka Arrow into Drax's chest, causing him severe pain, with Obfonteri making a hasty escape before Drax could learn he was to blame.

Infinity War
Meeting Thor
Drax asleep during the ride to the distress call
The Guardians of the Galaxy responded to a distress call from the Statesman, although Drax was asleep in his seat for much of the journey. After discovering the wreckage of the ship and bringing an unconscious Thor onboard, Drax commented that Star-Lord was merely a "dude," while Thor was a man.

Drax is introduced to Thor for the first time
Learning that Thanos was seeking to unite all six of the Infinity Stones, the decision was made to split the Guardians. While Rocket Raccoon and Groot accompanied Thor to Nidavellir, Drax went to Knowhere with Star-Lord, Gamora, and Mantis in an effort to stop Thanos from obtaining the Reality Stone.

Ambush in Knowhere
Drax watching over Peter Quill and Gamora
On the way to Knowhere, Drax watched as Gamora made Peter Quill promise to kill her if she gets captured by Thanos, due to her knowing something that could be dangerous if Thanos obtained the information from her. They shared a sweet moment that was interrupted by Drax. Asked how long he had been standing there, Drax appeared to believe that he could become invisible if he stood completely still, demonstrating this by remaining still and then moving very slowly, completely unaware that he was still visible to Quill and Gamora. Drax was very disappointed when Mantis walked in and greeted him, proving his theory wrong.

Drax watching Gamora seemingly kill Thanos
Arriving on Knowhere, they found Thanos trying to force the Collector to give him the Reality Stone. Eager to avenge his wife and daughter, Drax tried to attack Thanos before the Guardians of the Galaxy were ready. Star-Lord tried to restrain him, but Mantis intervened and used her abilities to make him sleep. While he was out, Gamora attacked and seemingly killed Thanos.

Drax recovers from Thanos' reality powers
However, it was all an illusion created by Thanos who had already obtained the Reality Stone. As Thanos took Gamora captive, Drax woke and angrily yelled at Thanos and tried to help, but Thanos, remaining calm, simply smirked at him and effortlessly incapacitated him with the Reality Stone, turning him to pieces. With Gamora in hand, Thanos used the Space Stone to teleport away from Knowhere, and Drax resumed his normal form.

Battle of Titan
Drax argues with Peter Quill
The Guardians returned to the Benatar where Quill played New York Groove on repeat to try and build back his "groove." Drax eventually became annoyed with this and stopped the music. The two then began to argue and blame each other for losing Gamora, Drax feeling that Quill stopped him from "seizing the moment" and killing Thanos. They were then alerted by Mantis of several messages that had been sent to them from Nebula.

Drax prepares to fight the Avengers
Quill then became frustrated at Drax as it was his job to watch the coded message channel, for which he did, but mixed Quill's rule for flushing with the blinking light. The message informed them that Gamora was alive and that they need to head to Titan. The Guardians headed to the planet and ambushed Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Doctor Strange, believing that they were in league with Thanos. After the misunderstanding was sorted out, the Guardians joined forces with them as Thanos was expected to come to them to obtain the Time Stone from Doctor Strange.

Drax yawns during Iron Man's speech
When Thanos arrived, Drax, as well as the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Avengers and Strange worked in concert in an effort to stop him. Drax and Strange first engaged Thanos in combat using their weapons and were able to hold their own, but Thanos' skills and strength was too much and Drax was the first overpowered and incapacitated with a powerful punch that sent him through stones.

Drax holds Thanos' leg so he can't escape
Drax quickly recovered, however, and he played a role in restraining Thanos by grabbing his leg. They were close to removing the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos after restraining him and getting Mantis to subdue his mind, but after Star-Lord discovered that Thanos had killed Gamora, he flew into a rage and allowed Thanos to escape the trap. Eventually, Thanos obtained the Time Stone and transported to Earth to claim the Mind Stone.

Thanos' Victory
Drax being turned into dust by Thanos
As the heroes recovered in the aftermath of the Battle of Titan, Thanos united the Infinity Stones and killed half of the universe with a snap of his fingers. On Titan, Drax watched on as Mantis was the first to disintegrate into dust. Drax then disintegrated afterwards, failing to exact his revenge on Thanos and avenge his family.

Battle of Earth
Drax returning to fight against Thanos' forces
In 2023, the surviving Avengers performed a Time Heist through the Quantum Realm to gather all the Infinity Stones. Hulk then used the Nano Gauntlet to snap his fingers and restore the victims. As the Battle of Earth between the Avengers against an alternate Thanos and his army seemed unwinnable, Drax turned up alongside Star-Lord, Mantis, Spider-Man and Doctor Strange through a portal created by the latter at the New Avengers Facility to aid the Avengers and their allies against Thanos' forces.

Drax repeatedly stabbing at Cull Obsidian
During the battle, Drax saved Korg from Cull Obsidian by attacking the giant from behind with his knives and allowing Korg to strike Obsidian. Drax ultimately survived the battle, which ended when Tony Stark snapped his fingers to decimate Thanos and his allies at the cost of his own life. All the heroes including Drax then gathered around the fallen hero and knelt before him, out of respect for his sacrifice.

Guardians Reunited
Drax attending the funeral of Tony Stark
After the Battle of Earth, Drax joined the Guardians of the Galaxy and their allies as they mourned the loss of Tony Stark by the Stark Eco-Compound. Although content that Thanos was no more, Drax possibly still felt a bit unsatisfied that he was not the one who killed him; however, he honored Stark's sacrifice anyway.

Drax suggesting Peter Quill and Thor duel
After the funeral, the Guardians decided to depart from Earth, taking on a new member, Thor. Once they were all onboard, there was a light interaction between Peter Quill and Thor in regards to who was in charge. Soon, the rest of the Guardians joined in, with Drax suggesting that they should fight to decide who should be the leader of group, which the two shut down, but still left who was the leader unanswered.

Personality
Underneath Drax's brutish appearance, serious demeanor, and seemingly unquenchable murderous rage, due to his quest to avenge his family, belies a sense of honor and a calm mind capable of strategy and refined eloquence. He was capable of elaborated speech filled with vocabulary few would expect someone like him to know when calm, enough to prompt Peter Quill to call him a thesaurus, which he disliked as he did not understand that it was a metaphor. As such, Drax demonstrated many times a severe lack of understanding for metaphors and symbolism, noted to be a trait of his people by Rocket Raccoon.
