<html><p>Rogers joined them inside the Benatar, having been asked by Rocket if one of them had ever been to space, before traveling to space through a jump point. Once they arrived, Captain Marvel flew over to the planet to check for recons, while Rogers began to look over to his compass with a picture of Peggy Carter. Once he was finished, Rogers was told by Romanoff that his plan will work, as he further noted that he knows it will just by not knowing what to do if it doesn't.

Rogers arriving inside of Thanos' Farm
Once they were informed that Thanos had no defenses to protect himself, they began to arrive at the spot in which he was inhabiting. Upon arriving on the Garden, Rogers and his team ambushed the Mad Titan. Sending his allies in, they managed to easily subdue Thanos, and Thor cut off the Titan's arm with the Infinity Gauntlet to keep him from using the Infinity Stones. Rogers and Romanoff walked over to confront Thanos and looked over to the Stones, realizing they were gone.

Rogers observes Thanos being killed by Thor
Rogers asked Thanos where were the Infinity Stones, being noted that the Stones served no purpose accept for anyone's temptation. Once they further interrogated him, Thanos told them he destroyed the Infinity Stones. Despite initially not believing him, Nebula reluctantly backed her father's claim as being serious. Rogers then watched Thor killing Thanos' head. Knowing they couldn't restore anyone back to life, Rogers and his allies return to Earth in defeat.

Return of Scott Lang
Rogers attending his support group for victims
Five years after the Snap, Rogers remained with the Avengers, while also working at the Brooklyn Support Group for those who have lost their loved ones following the disaster. Despite the destruction caused by Thanos, the world was slowly recovering and Rogers urged his support group to talk about their lives.

Rogers happily talking with his support group
While someone at the support group was talking about their date and how they were effected by the Snap, Rogers accepted on letting his sadness sympathize with others. Rogers noted to the rest of the group that they must take baby steps in trying to find purpose, leading an example of having himself being stuck under ice in 1945 and then pulled back seventy years later. Rogers concluded that they must move on, as the world is on their hands.

Rogers privately talks with Natasha Romanoff
Returning to the compound after his meeting, Rogers met up with Romanoff who handled the reports from their allies on Earth and Space. Rogers offered to cook dinner for Romanoff but chose not to due to her misery. As he sat down for a talk, Rogers admitted to Romanoff one thing; while he had been telling everyone to move on, he couldn't move on from the past himself. After Romanoff had told Rogers that she had nothing before joining the Avengers and was better because of it, Rogers said that they need to get a better life.

Rogers talks to Scott Lang about Time Travel
While they conversed, they were alerted to a new arrival; Scott Lang, who was assumed dead from the Snap. Letting Lang in, they learned that he has been trapped in the Quantum Realm during the five years; however, from his perspective, it has only been five hours. Lang reasoned that by using quantum physics to their advantage, they might be able to take place before Thanos. Knowing they could talk about this, Rogers and Romanoff headed off to find Tony Stark.

Asking For Assistance
Rogers arrives to meet Tony Stark again
During those five years, Stark married Pepper Potts and had a daughter, Morgan Stark, living at a secluded location. While Stark and his daughter were about to enter back into the cabin, Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Scott Lang approached him with the possibility of bringing everyone back through time travel.

Rogers meets Tony Stark by his porch
After telling Stark about the act of time traveling, they listened to his argument against the idea of time travel, fearing that they'll never be coming back. Once Lang told Stark that he came back from the present, he told Lang that his case was a billion in one chances of a cosmic fluke thus it could not happened. Despite of the group taking a stand to fix what had happened to everyone, Stark reluctantly refuses to join the Time Heist before Morgan saved him.

Rogers abruptly leaves Tony Stark's home
While Stark was happy to see them and invited them for lunch if they wanted to stay, Rogers told Stark that he was very glad on what he had built for himself but the Time Heist was their second chance, but Stark told him that he already has a second chance and can't risk going back. Despite their best attempts, they couldn't convince Stark to help them and left the cabin before wanting to do something right, heading to Bruce Banner the next day for some help.

Rogers reunites with the newly reformed Hulk
Meeting Banner over at a diner, the group learned that, during the five years, Banner has gained newfound control over Hulk. Now with the combination of both personalities, Banner was permanently in Hulk form, but maintained his scientific mind and identity. After Hulk was taking photos with kids, Rogers told him to focus about what they were talking about going back in time. With his knowledge of quantum physics, Hulk doubted that it could be done, but agreed to test with them.

Planning a Heist
Rogers observes Scott Lang's experiment
The Avengers used the Quantum Tunnel experiment with the time scale of bringing Scott Lang back to the present after he visits the past. Rogers observed away from the situation and told Lang that they'll see him afterwards. Unfortunately their attempts were disastrous as while they could manipulate time, they were aging or de-aging Lang in the process.

Rogers witnesses Hulk's surprised reaction
After witnessing Lang being aged and de-aged with each time they pull him to the present, Rogers told Banner to turn the machine off, leading Banner to kill the power switch. Once Natasha Romanoff turned the machine off, Lang reverted into himself in the present. While Banner boasted about his discovery of Time Travel, Rogers turned to becoming aimless and began to move out from the New Avengers Facility for a break. However, Tony Stark arrived at the facility, much to the surprise of Rogers.

Rogers meets up with Tony Stark again
Once Stark had parked his car in front of Rogers, he rightly guessed that the Avengers' first attempt to time travel was a failure. When Rogers asked Stark why he arrived in the Compound, Stark gets out of his car and tells him that the EPR paradox had affected Lang by letting time go pass through him. Rogers guessed that Stark had solved time travel, to which he admitted on inventing a Time-Space GPS. After having a change of heart, Stark informed Rogers that while he wants to bring everyone back, he also doesn't want to lose what he currently has, namely his family.

Rogers receives his shield from Tony Stark
The two finally reconcile with each other, with Stark admitting that resentment is corrosive, leading Rogers to agree with him as well. Knowing he has a special gift for him, Stark took out Rogers' old shield from the trunk of his car and gave it back to him, signifying that their old alliance and friendship has been reforged (while also saying that he had to get it out of the garage before Morgan finds it). With Stark back on the team, Rogers begin rallying the rest of his allies, with Banner and Rocket Raccoon retrieving Thor, and Romanoff searching for Clint Barton.

Rogers listens on where to find the Stones
Once the remaining team members arrived at the New Avengers Facility, the Avengers tested the process with Hawkeye going back and returning. With this successful test, they regrouped in a room and gathered information on the history and previous whereabouts of the Infinity Stones, including their former owners and their past interactions with each of the Avengers. As Rogers asked Thor about the Aether, he gave a vague story of its history, revealing to them that his grandfather, Bor, defeated the Dark Elves during a war, and proceeded to note how his former girlfriend, Jane Foster, had been possessed by the Aether.

Rogers further listens on finding the Stones
As they continue to brainstorm their next move, Rogers and the Avengers continued to discuss the Infinity Stones, eventually learning that the Power Stone was stolen by Star-Lord on Morag during dinner with Rocket who explained the process of it. They then learned that the Soul Stone was on Vormir, and that the Time Stone, Mind Stone, and Space Stone were present in New York during the Chitauri Invasion.

The Avengers complete the Time Heist plan
With each brainstorming session coming to a close, the team's decisions had been concluded through their hologram display, setting at different locations on where to find the Stones; being New York City in 2012, Asgard in 2013, and Vormir and Morag in 2014.Rogers rallied up the team and told them that they only have three teams to go over these timelines and only one shot to make it count.

Time Heist
Infiltration into Stark Tower
Rogers prepares to time travel back to 2012
With their plans ready, the Avengers proceeded on with the Time Heist, donning themselves with the Advanced Tech Suits and went into the time machine and headed to their positions. As the team had gathered around, Rogers gave a speech about how they lost friends, family, a part of themselves but now they have a chance to get them back for whatever it takes.

Rogers arrives in New York City back in 2012
Arriving in New York City in 2012, during the Battle of New York, the group had traveled through time inside the loop of the appropriate place, taking off their Advanced Suits. Rogers informed the group that they'll all have to know their positions on where the Infinity Stones are and keep an eye on each other so they could get out as quickly as possibly. After Hulk from 2012 had smashed a Chitauri soldier through some wreckage, Rogers ordered Banner to smash a few things before finding the Time Stone.

Rogers finds the Scepter with HYDRA's hands
While Rogers focused primarily on getting the Scepter, Iron Man and Ant-Man went to Stark Tower to retrieve the Tesseract. While Stark and Lang learned where to find the Tesseract, Stark told Rogers to get inside Stark Tower, noting they're almost wrapped up on capturing Loki. Rogers infiltrated Stark Tower and managed to know the location of the Scepter after knowing where each Stone was taken around the location and who possesses them.

Rogers successfully steals back the Scepter
Finding it under the possession of Jasper Sitwell and Brock Rumlow, Rogers met them at the elevator. Knowing them to be HYDRA operatives, Rogers looked around them and felt the tension being so high once the agents questioned Rogers' intent. Rogers asked Sitwell to hand over the Scepter so that he can protect it, only for Sitwell to warn him from Nick Fury. Rogers told Sitwell to not call Fury and whispered "Hail HYDRA," before escalating the situation. Much to their shock, Rogers was handed the Scepter and began to make his exit.

Fighting Himself
Rogers tries to contact the rest of the group
While attempting to head out of Stark Tower, Rogers grew suspicious and asked the group if they retrieved the Tesseract. As he looked up after questioning his team, Rogers found himself confronting his 2012 self, much to his absolute shock. Rogers' past self believed that Rogers was Loki, but Rogers tried to tell him that he isn't and doesn't want to hurt him.

Rogers fighting against himself from the past
The two Captain Americas then fought a fierce battle in the tower, clashing each other's shields. Rogers fights his past self only to be kicked away and being told that he could do this all day, leading to himself to be gradually annoyed. Rogers threw his shield at his past self. leading to them being thrown away and exchange blows until they grappled each other in order for them to stop attacking. They would suddenly kick away the case with the Scepter inside, falling on the ground.

Rogers tries to stop fighting his past self
Rogers tried to grab onto his past self only for them to slip up from the edge, leading them to fall off the platform and land on a flight of stairs and then on multiple ledges. Once they had landed on the ground in pain, Rogers' past self looked at his future self's compass with Peggy Carter on it, getting up from the ground and asked his future self about where he got it. Rogers attempted to grab the Scepter on the ground only to be grappled by his past self.

Rogers escapes the building with the Scepter
While being pinned down on the ground in a choke hold, Rogers rolled around gasping of air and began to think of something to remove himself from the fight. Rogers distracted his past self by revealing Bucky Barnes' survival. Using the distraction, Rogers got out of his counterpart's grip and punched him in the face, using the Scepter to knock him unconscious, all while confirming a comment Stark and Scott said to him about his buttocks. Managing to escape Stark Tower, Rogers regrouped with Iron Man and Ant-Man in an alley.

Rogers listens to Tony Stark's backup plan
Rogers noticed Stark and Lang once they admitted on their failure of retrieving the Tesseract. Having less Pym Particles, Lang lectured the group that they'll won't be coming home. Rogers told the team that if they'll won't try than nobody will go home. Once Stark had an idea of taking the Tesseract, Rogers listened to him about going into a military installation. Rogers asked for a date but Stark admitted that he doesn't know the exact date but knows where to go.

Rogers and Tony Stark go back to 1970s
Knowing that they have to improvise, Rogers gave Lang the Scepter and told him to get it back into the New Avengers Facility. They begin to set up a date as April 7, 1970 before Lang told them if they failed their mission, then they won't be coming back home. Once they settled their trust, Rogers and Stark equipped their Advanced Tech Suits traveled back in time again, leaving Lang behind to return to the present with the Scepter.

Infiltration into Camp Lehigh
Rogers leads Tony Stark into a nearby bunker
Arriving at Camp Lehigh, New Jersey on April 7th in an alternate 1970, Rogers and Stark proceed to look for the Tesseract and extra Pym Particles. Using his knowledge from his 2014 visit to the base, Rogers informed Stark that the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility's secret entrance was disguised as an ammunition bunker.

Rogers briefly talks to Agent Phyllis Jenkins
Rogers and Stark then entered the bunker and took an elevator down while Phyllis Jenkins, an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., looked over to them suspiciously. Once Stark told Rogers good luck once he arrived on the floor that he tracked down, he talked to Jenkins once he was asked if he was new there, responding to her that he wasn't exactly new. While Stark headed off to find the Tesseract, Rogers went over to find Pym Particles from Hank Pym.

Rogers finds a few extra Pym Particles
Calling Pym on the phone, Rogers managed to lure him out of his lab, by fooling him into believing that staff members have opened a package meant for him. With Pym out of his lab, Rogers looked around the lab and managed to find a few Pym Particles to steal and began looking for Stark. As Rogers made his way out, he noticed that Jenkins had informed military personnel on the base to find him and Stark, as she had found them suspicious. After Rogers hid inside an office, he discovered a picture of himself.

Rogers finds Peggy Carter in the past
Looking behind the door after his suspicions grew stronger, Rogers found out that he walked into Peggy Carter's office by mistake and had suddenly heard the noise coming through the walls of the office. Spotting his old love through her office window, Rogers mournfully watched her as Carter continued her day, unaware of his presence. Leaving Carter's office, Rogers managed to find his way out of the facility and waited for Stark's arrival.

Rogers signals Tony Stark about the Tesseract
Rogers spotted Stark, who managed to get the Tesseract, but also encountered his father, Howard. As Stark finished his conversation with his father, Rogers signaled that if he had retrieved the Tesseract, having his suspicions being quickly confirmed. Once Stark reconcile with his father, they were ready to leave the camp with the tools they need and gathered up quickly to return to the present inside the New Avengers Facility.

Death of Black Widow
Rogers learns of Natasha Romanoff's death
Returning to 2023, the entire team of Avengers have now escape from the past and had retrieve each individual Infinity Stones. Once Rogers had arrived back from 1970, Hulk made a brief statement on making sure if anybody had all of the stones. Upon arriving in the present, however, Rogers and Banner learned that Natasha Romanoff sacrificed herself on Vormir so that Hawkeye could obtain the Soul Stone.

Rogers mourns over Black Widow's death
As the Avengers mourned Romanoff's death, Rogers told Tony Stark that they were her family and silently cried over the death of his friend. Despite of the team's assurance, Thor was in denial that Romanoff was truly gone. Rogers witnessed Thor ranting about getting her back by using the Infinity Stones; however, Barton argued against him considering that the sacrifice can not be undone. Once Hulk claimed that they must not let Romanoff's sacrifice be in vain, Rogers became determined to let the sacrifice be worth it.

The Blip
Captain America tells Thor to listen to them
With all the Infinity Stones collected, Iron Man, Hulk, and Rocket Raccoon proceed to build the Nano Gauntlet in the lab. Once the Gauntlet had been finished, the Avengers must figure out who will be able wear it and resurrect the lives claimed by Thanos' Snap. When Thor volunteered to do it, Rogers and the team hold him back until they discuss who should be able to snap their fingers with the Nano Gauntlet.

Captain America prepares for Hulk's Snap
Despite Thor's justification to use the Nano Gauntlet, they proceeded to not let him do it for his survivability sake. After Thor pleaded to use the Gauntlet, Banner volunteered to use the it, telling the team that he was the only one strong enough to withstand the resulting burst of cosmic energy and the Gamma Radiation that powers it. Once the team had settled on the decision, Rogers prepared for the burst of energy that Banner would suffer from the Infinity Stones.

Captain America witnesses Hulk's suffrage
As Hulk finally equipped the Nano Guantlet and channeled the energy of the Infinity Stones, Rogers witnessed him in pain from the energy flowing through his body, leading Rogers to ask him if he was well condition. Once Hulk told the team that he was good enough to get through it, Hulk snapped his fingers and resurrected all the other half of life in the universe; however, they were unaware that the 2014 Thanos and his warship had arrived in the present through the time travel machine by 2014 Nebula.

Attack on the Avengers Facility
Captain America wakes from the destruction
Just as the Avengers realized that the Nano Gauntlet had worked, Thanos' warship unleashed a hailstorm of missiles from the sky, reducing the New Avengers Facility to a smoldering crater. While War Machine, Hulk, Hawkeye, and Ant-Man were trapped below the facility, Rogers was left unconscious underneath the rubble on top of the rubble. Once Iron Man got up to find Captain America on the ground, he was quickly woken up and given back his shield.

Captain America decides to confront Thanos
After the Snap was undone, Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor discovered Thanos from the year 2014, who was fully aware of his plan's success and his fate, has arrived on Earth. Captain America asked Iron Man where the Infinity Stones are, as he noted that they were underneath the rubble. Knowing Thanos has been doing nothing outside, Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man eventually emerge from the rubble. After acknowledging that it was a trap and they do not care, the trio resolve to keep the stones away from him.

Captain America confronts Thanos outside
After Thor summoned his armor and wielded both Stormbreaker and Mjølnir, the group confronted Thanos. The Titan began to lecture them about how they could not live with their failure and realized that there are those that remember what was, who are unable to accept what can be. Thanos now believed that the universe would be ungrateful for him "correcting" it, and decided on a new plan to decimate the entire universe and create a new one.

Captain America fighting against Thanos
Captain America noted to Thanos that his new universe will be born out of blood before Thanos threatened to kill him and the team. The trio swiftly attacked Thanos, and were overwhelmed by Thanos' imposing speed and power, and his immense skill with his large Double-Edged Sword. Thanos eventually knocked out Iron Man from the battle after Thor tried to attack Mjølnir with it. Captain America then kicked Thanos in the face until he was knocked away from the field.

Captain America begins to attack with Mjølnir
Before Thanos pinned down Thor on the ground and attempted to can kill him with Stormbreaker, Captain America picked up Mjølnir and threw it at him, as he was taken a hard hit, knocking him off his feet. The hammer flew back into Captain America's hand, realizing he had no other choice but to reveal he had been deemed worthy by the mystical hammer years earlier. Using his new weapon in combination with his shield, Captain America attacked Thanos by overwhelming him with blow to the face.

Captain America persisting against Thanos
Captain America fought Thanos by using Mjølnir and his shield. Captain America then summoned lightning, dragging it all over the Mad Titan so he could be pinned to the ground. Captain America then summoned lighting again and blasted Thanos on the ground before attempting to hit him again, only for him to grappled and slammed onto the ground. Feeling exhausted from the fight, Captain America dodged Thanos' attacks only to be injured, as his arm and leg were swiftly harmed from with the Double-Edged Sword.

Captain America shield is broken by Thanos
Upon losing Mjølnir, Rogers raised his shield to protect himself, but the sword sliced right through it. While Thanos violently swings the sword down repeatedly, breaking more and more pieces off of the shield, Captain America was then pinned down to the ground and knocked away from the field. While lying on the ground, Captain America listened to Thanos about how it was never personal but noted the pleasure he would take unleashing his wrath on Earth.

Captain America ready to fight Thanos' armies
As Thanos summoned his immense army from the Sanctuary II, an outnumbered, bloody, and battered Rogers rose up from the ground, re-tightens the strap on his broken shield to his wounded forearm, and stood ready to face Thanos and his entire army alone, when he suddenly receives a radio communication from Falcon, who told him to look on his left. Immediately afterwards, a Portal opened from behind Rogers, from which Black Panther, Okoye and Shuri emerged, following by Falcon.

Battle of Earth
Captain America assembles the Avengers
After seeing his now resurrected allies, Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and various other heroes who were disintegrated in the Snap emerge from numerous portals opened up by Doctor Strange and Wong, along with the combined armies of Wakanda, the Ravagers, the Asgardians, and the Masters of the Mystic Arts. After everyone forms up to face Thanos and his forces, Captain America, reunited with his previously deceased allies, assembled his team to charge against Thanos' forces.

Captain America fights alongside with Thor
The entire team and other forces began to charge with fury attentions, running towards Thanos forces as he sends his Black Order, Chitauri army, Sakaaran army, and the Outriders to kill them all. Captain America ran across the battlefield with his allies and, during the initial clash, cast Mjølnir at Cull Obsidian. Captain America then teamed up with Thor, who was using Mjølnir to kill surrounding Sakaarans, and accidentally summoned Stormbreaker to his hand, resulting in them exchange weapons afterwards.

Captain America asks the team about a van
Captain America was then informed by Hawkeye about the Nano Gauntlet, and told him to get it away from the battlefield as far as possible, only for Hulk tell him that they need to get the Infinity Stones back where they came from. Despite Thanos destroying the Quantum Tunnel, Ant-Man turned on Luis' van as another time machine, leading Captain America to ask where the van is. Being told where is parked by Valkyrie, Captain America ordered Ant-Man to get it started.

Captain America attempts to kill off Thanos
Shortly after the Sanctuary II rained fire on the battlefield, Captain America heard Spider-Man calling for aid. Captain America threw Mjølnir in his direction, which Spider-Man caught before he was overwhelmed by Thanos' forces. Relief soon came in the form of Captain Marvel, who destroyed the Sanctuary II, much to Captain America's surprise from afar. Captain America then ordered Danvers to assist them in getting the Stones away from Thanos and his army. When Thanos shoved his Double-Edged Sword into the Quantum Tunnel and came close to wielding the Nano Gauntlet, Captain America threw himself at Thanos to prevent him from using it, as Thor wrestled with Thanos into impaling him with Stormbreaker.

Captain America realizes they won the battle
After Captain America managed to briefly tip the balance by pulling the blade towards Thanos' throat, he was once again able to break free from their grasp; flipping Captain America over his shoulder and punching him hard in the face, leaving him unable to stop the Mad Titan from seizing the Gauntlet. Iron Man then stole the Infinity Stones back from Thanos, forming another Nano Gauntlet within his Armor, and then snapped his fingers; causing Thanos and his army to disintegrate.

Captain America witnesses Iron Man's death
Captain America witnessed Thanos' army disintegrating in front of his eyes, along with Thanos' shock in horror from all the death surrounding him. Captain America took a long look at Thanos' failure before he crumbled into ash. Along with War Machine, Spider-Man, Pepper Potts, and Thor, Captain America tearfully stood by Stark as he died from his injuries caused by the resulting energy surge.

Last Mission
Returning the Stones
Rogers and the Avengers mourning Tony Stark
Rogers attended the funeral for his friend and fellow Avenger, Tony Stark, along with all of their allies. Rogers, along with Stark's family, Happy Hogan, James Rhodes and the remaining original Avengers, gathered inside Stark's home, where they watched a recorded message Stark left before the Time Heist. They all then stood outside as Stark's Arc Reactor was sent adrift in the lake. At some point before or after the funeral, Rogers confided in Bucky Barnes that he was planning to live out the rest of his life in the past after completing his final mission and that he would return to the present at an old age to give a new version of his shield to Sam Wilson.

Rogers and Sam Wilson discuss the mission
After the funeral, the Avengers prepared to return the Infinity Stones and Mjølnir to whence they were taken to prevent devastating branches in those timelines. Rogers volunteered for this mission and met up with Hulk, Barnes, and Wilson in the forest outside the destroyed New Avengers Facility, where Banner had constructed a new time machine. Banner then told Rogers that when he reversed the Snap, he tried to bring Black Widow back, but couldn't, and that he misses her, leading Rogers to share his grief.

Rogers prepares to return the Infinity Stones
As he walked to the time machine, Wilson offered to go with him as backup, but Rogers reassured him that he can do it alone. He then says goodbye to Barnes, puts on his Advanced Tech Suit, and travels back in time along with the Infinity Stones and Mjølnir. Rogers then proceeded to return the mythical objects to their proper places in the timeline, including returning the Soul Stone to Vormir, where he encountered the Red Skull for the first time since World War II.

A Normal Life
Rogers and Peggy Carter finally have a dance
Once his job was completed, Rogers chose to travel to 1949 in order to live out the rest of his life with Peggy Carter instead of returning to 2023 as planned, thus creating an altered timeline. Reunited with Carter, he finally gives her the dance he promised her, and the two eventually got married. After his marriage, Rogers retired his "Captain America" moniker, but would continue to help out when he was needed in his new timeline.

Passing on the Shield
Rogers returns to 2023 as an older man
Enjoying his long retirement, Rogers stayed with Peggy Carter until her death in 2016. Afterward, he traveled back to his original timeline, to the same time in 2023 when he left to return the Infinity Stones, and waited on a nearby bench until Bucky Barnes noticed him and alerted Sam Wilson to his presence.

Rogers greeting Sam Wilson once he returns
When Wilson questioned a now elderly Rogers, he told him that after he returned the stones to their timelines, he decided to live the normal life that Tony Stark suggested. When Wilson asked how it worked out, Rogers said that it was beautiful, and Wilson said that he was truly happy for him, although upset that he would have to live in a world without Captain America. Rogers then opened a circular case that rested next to him and took out his shield, giving it to Wilson, who then put it on. Rogers asked Wilson how it felt, and when Wilson responded that it felt like it was someone else's, Rogers assured him it wasn't, officially passing the title of Captain America to him.

Rogers passes on the shield to Falcon
Wilson then promised Rogers that he would do his best to protect the world, and Rogers noted that that's why he chose him. Noticing a ring on Rogers' finger while they shook hands, Wilson asked if he wanted to tell him about his wife, but Rogers politely declined, smiling at a memory that he recalled from a dance he had with Carter that he promised to her all those years ago, and proceeded to kiss her.

Time Heist
Fighting A Familiar Enemy
Captain America comes across "Loki"
In an alternate 2012, after defeating Loki in the Battle of New York, Captain America left the Avengers to coordinate search and rescue. However, while Captain America was still in Stark Tower, he was notified of Loki escaping their custody. Shortly after, Captain America came across who he thought to be Loki with the Scepter disguised as him, but was actually an alternate version of himself from 2023.

Captain America fights future Captain America
Captain America reported that he had found Loki, but the other Captain America tried to explain he wasn't Loki. Refusing to believe what he was saying, Captain America then attack him, and the two began to fight, soon losing both of their shields. They then fought hand to hand, which was fairly even, until they both slipped, falling fourteen floors. As they got up, Captain America noticed his compass drop from "Loki," so he asked where he got it, but he attempted to grab the Scepter, so they continued fighting.

Captain America is affected by the Scepter
Due to his focus being on retrieving the Scepter, Captain America was able to overpower him and get him in a headlock. However, the other Captain America told him that Bucky Barnes is alive, causing him to become distracted, and letting go of his grip. The other Captain America then took this chance to grab the Scepter and use it on him, causing him to become unconscious and have his memory of this wiped. He later commented about himself saying "That is America's ass" before walking away with the scepter.

Personality
Considered by many as the world's first and greatest superhero, Steve Rogers has been defined by his courage, patriotism, and righteousness. Rogers has always had a noble and honest spirit, intolerant towards injustice and abuses of power. Since he grew up weak and small, he learned on his own that true strength is having the courage to fight against abuse, no matter one's power, and having compassion for the innocent. Despite being transformed into a perfect human by the Super Soldier Serum, he maintained his original values and character. Since his reawakening, Rogers was saddened by losing so much of his time, but still retains the same values he had since the 1940s. Due to his famed past exploits and his continued works to save the world, Rogers is generally respected by many; even if he doesn't seek acknowledgment for his deeds. He was also very empathetic; being able to understand and relate to both Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver before meeting them and understanding Tony Stark's motivation during the Avengers Civil War, despite Iron Man being on the opposing side. He also conceded that Tony had very good reasons not to join the Time Heist and openly said he was happy that his friend had finally found the peace that he'd so desperately wanted.

What separates Steve Rogers from the other Avengers is two things: his humanity and morality. Steve Rogers is an extremely dedicated person. Despite originally being physically weak and small, and rejected many times due to his frail health, he still tried to enlist in the Army during World War II. Steve tried to be of service in whatever way he was allowed; even when his talents were wasted when he was ordered to inspire the American soldiers and support the  war effort by starring in U.S. propaganda. When he heard that the 107th battalion, including Bucky, was captured in a nearby HYDRA facility, Rogers disobeyed his superior's orders and went behind enemy lines in an apparent suicide mission and rescued them. Rogers finds the courage to defend the weak and innocent, and does not hesitate to stand up to corrupt politicians, hypocritical authority figures, powerful beings like Loki, or even the nearly omnipotent Thanos. His determination also aids him, giving him a boost in physical power to allow him to hold off beings of much greater strength, with this even allowing him to survive against Thanos. A true hero, Rogers is more than willing to sacrifice himself to protect others and does not care if he is considered the villain in his heroic job, as his desire to protect the innocent remained as strong as ever, even after he was deemed a criminal. Though he refused to give up in the immediate aftermath of the Snap, following the disastrous Ambush on Thanos, even Rogers conceded defeat. When Scott Lang returned however, Rogers quickly got his fighting spirit back, being the first to support Scott's plan. The true extent of his determination and selfless heroism was fully exemplified when he finally proved himself worthy to wield Mjølnir. Amusingly however, when facing off with his past self, Rogers actually seemed annoyed by his own sheer determination.

Rogers is not afraid to do what's right for the greater good and make the tough choices, even if it might be costly to him personally. As both a soldier and an Avenger, Rogers knows full well that war has its casualties and some of his dearest friends, or even himself, may need to make the ultimate sacrifice. He was willing to justify violence and killing to defend others and to preserve peace and freedom, even when Nick Fury called him out on various war crimes he and the American army committed during World War II. Rogers once had to tell Natasha Romanoff to close the Chitauri portal, despite Stark not being out yet. Rogers was also willing to fight his best friend Bucky Barnes when the latter was preventing Steve from saving over twenty million innocent lives. Nevertheless, Captain America will always prioritize civilian lives. For example, Rogers would not abandon Novi Grad until all of its citizens were evacuated; even when Ultron was planning on smashing the city to the ground to create more damage to Earth. His heroism and determination to what he believes is morally right, no matter the personal cost, even allowed him to move Mjølnir slightly when he attempted to lift it following the retrieval of the Scepter, much to the surprise and discomfort of Thor. He also does not approve of sacrificing others to achieve victory should other options remain available; he refused to let Vision sacrifice himself, instead looking for a way to separate him from the Mind Stone.

Captain America's uncompromising sense of morality and selflessness often puts him at odds with Tony Stark, who is more comfortable with a grey morality to protect people. This has led to several moments of bickering, arguments, and almost physical fights over the direction of the Avengers in how to protect people. Despite their differences, however, they both respect each other, work well together, and have even formed a close friendship. This difference in attitude, reached a head in the Avengers Civil War, where Tony sought to compromise with governments who were increasingly intolerant with collateral damage, while Rogers refused to do so, believing it would inhibit the Avengers' response time, eventually causing him to become a fugitive. Rogers nevertheless still cared for Tony and did not desire for them to fight, as he pleaded with Tony to stop attacking Bucky, as the latter did it without having control and did not kill him after beating him, even going as far as to send him a letter to apologize and a phone so Stark can contact him. He was visibly ashamed when Tony demanded him to tell the truth of his parents' death, and felt enough sympathy and remorse for keeping the truth hidden that he relinquished his shield and returned it to the Stark family. Two years later, after much of the anger between the two factions of Avengers had died down, Rogers outright referred to Iron Man as Earth's "best defender," even joking that he himself was a poor substitute emphasizing the respect he maintained for Tony.

While Captain America's sense of duty exceeds his personal feelings, his sense of loyalty is difficult to surpass. After realizing the Winter Soldier was his long thought to be a dead best friend, he only fought him to disable HYDRA's Helicarriers. However, once the Helicarriers were destroyed, he immediately stopped fighting the Winter Soldier in an attempt to reason with him and help him remember their friendship. This reached its apex in the Avengers Civil War, where Steve steadfastly refused to give up on Bucky, which caused the Avengers to fracture along with more than half their number to become fugitives.

Since being defrosted by S.H.I.E.L.D., Steve was lost in a world he no longer knew. America had changed; though technology had greatly advanced, humane morals were constantly being compromised in favor of political expediency. To make matters worse, most of the people he loved from his past were gone, or greatly aged. Even while working with S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers, Steve still had no real life outside of being a soldier. Steve did not know how to belong and strives to uphold his code of honor in this new complicated world. Although he eventually reunited with both Peggy and Bucky, Steve was still a "man out of time." However, after the battle against Ultron, Steve finally realized that he was no longer the man he was before he was frozen. Hence, Steve decided to focus his life on just helping people, taking a permanent role as the leader of the second incarnation of the Avengers.

He is very protective of his friends from his past, especially Bucky Barnes, and is willing to go to great lengths to save them, being susceptible to emotional and violent acts to fulfill his goal. He seems to have developed a trust and attraction towards Sharon Carter. During his time with the new team of Avengers, he developed a trust and bond with Black Widow. He also embraces links to his own time, often seeing much of Howard Stark in Tony. He is also very selfless and is willing to risk his life for his teammates, such as when he jumped in to save Black Widow from Proxima Midnight, without knowing he would be strong enough to hold back her spear.

He does have a darker side, however, with Ultron noting that Rogers had been a soldier for so long, he subconsciously craved conflict and battles to avoid a civilian life and being forced to confront all he lost. Indeed, his worst nightmare, caused by Wanda Maximoff, was shown to be the end of the war, with people not needing him anymore, leaving him with one hollow realization: everyone whom he had ever loved was gone, and he was alone. Overall, Rogers is a selfless person but one with a notable blind spot: his childhood friend Bucky Barnes. The last living link to his time, Rogers was willing to do everything to protect him, going so far as to abandon his role as leader of the Avengers and a team player. When Tony called Rogers out on failing the role of Captain America, at the end of their fight during the Avengers Civil War, Rogers abandoned his shield and with it, the identity of "Captain America," heeding Tony's point. Even years later, he had made no efforts to reclaim the moniker allowing his uniform to darken and removing the American stars that had once adorned it.

Rogers has a strong dislike for agencies or groups that express control over the individual, due to having fought vigorously for his nations' freedom and losing the world he knew for that very reason. This dislike extends to groups of any ideology be they HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D., or even America's own government. Rogers himself admits that the Howling Commandos committed less than moral actions during World War II, but it was for the basis that people could be free, whereas Project Insight was using fear to dissuade a national security risk before it happens, eliminating the need for a soldier like himself and taking away the American people's freedom. The desire for free will heavily influenced Rogers' opinion on the Sokovia Accords. He strongly believed that the extravagant politics involved would restrict (or at least hinder) the Avengers' efforts to protect innocent people, putting him at odds with the very pragmatic Tony Stark on the issue. His opinion on such groups lessened, when the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre locked up Barnes in a cage. In the end, such was his dislike that he cut all ties with them and became a fugitive after the Avengers Civil War. While he still retains his desire to protect the innocent, he has no desire to be re-acknowledged as a superhero and does not care about the opinions of government bodies, as he coldly told Thaddeus Ross that he did not care if the latter disapproves of him and even went as far as to say he would not hesitate to fight him if he got in his way.

The Snap had a profound effect on Rogers' optimism, with their failure to stop Thanos causing him to take on a darker, yet somewhat grim persona, even non-verbally conceding that Tony's intentions behind Ultron's creation had been noble and would aid in Infinity War, if the AI had not gone rogue. When Thanos was revealed to had destroyed the Infinity Stones, Rogers stopped his fight for the next five years, instead choosing to become a grief counselor, before Scott Lang returned with a plan. After Tony had sacrificed himself to win the Battle of Earth, Rogers honored his friend by finally retiring and enjoying the life he'd never thought he'd have.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Artificially Enhanced Physiology: The Super Soldier Serum enhanced all of Rogers' bodily functions, such as his strength, durability, speed, agility, stamina, reflexes, senses, healing, and lifespan to superhuman levels. He is very muscular, athletic and physically capable. The Super Soldier Serum also healed all of his ailments, physical and genetic imperfections instantly, giving him a perfect body better than that of a man in his physical prime. It also prevents him from getting intoxicated by alcohol, meaning he cannot get drunk. The Super Soldier Serum permanently transformed him from a frail young man into the "perfect" specimen of human development and conditioning.

Enhanced Intelligence: Rogers' mental performance has been greatly enhanced to operate in the most efficient and rapid manner possible. Some manifestations of this are his exceptionally perfect charisma, eloquence, leadership skills, deductive skills, analytical skills, and tactical genius. Rogers has demonstrated the ability to quickly process multiple information streams and rapidly respond to any changing tactical situations by creating perfect winning strategies rapidly. Rogers possesses perfect memory as demonstrated when he was able to perfectly replicate the locations of all HYDRA bases on a map, despite "only getting a glance," as well as retain obscure details of his youth with Bucky Barnes even the latter could not. He also remembered what Barnes said to him after his mother's funeral 78 years earlier and repeated it to overcome the latter's brainwashing. It took him less than a minute to realize that his "recovery room" was a lie because he remembered the baseball game being broadcasted on the radio. Rogers is able to learn anything, such as memorize, understand and recall all kinds of information and skills within short period of time much faster than normal humans. He was able to quickly master WWII-era armed force disciplines including intelligence gathering, espionage, escape arts, demolitions, survival, swimming, mountaineering, march or drill skills, cartography, map reading, communications, and army vehicle skills. Moreover, even though he was unconscious, Rogers was able to recall the conversation S.H.I.E.L.D. agents had while they were defrosting him. Further evidence of his mental capacity enhancement is that he is able to anticipate the angle of deflection when his shield is thrown, when it deflects off of his target which can change from hard metal surfaces to yielding human bodies and still ensure that the shield returns to his hand. Even with his limited knowledge of modern technology, Rogers was still able to help Tony Stark repair a Helicarrier to prevent it from crashing, and help Hulk to set up their time travel apparatus, or when he quickly gave the Avengers and the first responders an efficient plan to minimize and contain damage to New York City from the Chitauri invasion. Rogers also quickly assimilated to modern culture through extensive reading and the Internet. Since the Super Soldier Serum amplifies personality aspects as well, Rogers' brain chemistry is also altered. Though Rogers was brave, determined, and compassionate before, the SSS has also amplified those character traits. Rogers can learn much faster than an ordinary human. For instance, he became highly proficient in using weapons such as Proxima Midnight's spear, Corvus Glaive's glaive, Loki's Scepter, Mjølnir, and Stormbreaker by quickly learning to use them within short period of time. Indeed, Rogers was the only Avenger who was able and worthy to lift Mjølnir, despite Thor's claims to the Guardians of the Galaxy that any attempts to lift a weapon of a similar type by one who is not worthy would result in their bodies crumbling and their minds simultaneously collapsing into madness.
