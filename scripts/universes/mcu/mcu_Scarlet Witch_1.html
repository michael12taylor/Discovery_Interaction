Wanda Maximoff, also known as Scarlet Witch, is a native of Sokovia who grew up with her fraternal twin brother, Pietro. Born with the latent mythical ability to harness Chaos Magic, she developed a hatred against Tony Stark and rallied anti-American protests after the Novi Grad Bombings killed her parents. Years later, in an effort to help purge their country of strife, the twins joined HYDRA and agreed to undergo experiments with the Scepter under the supervision of Wolfgang von Strucker, with the Mind Stone awakening and amplifying Wanda's powers. While her brother developed super-speed, she attained various psionic abilities. When HYDRA fell, the twins joined Ultron to get their revenge on Stark, but abandoned him when they discovered his true intentions to eradicate humanity. Wanda and Pietro joined the Avengers during the Battle of Sokovia to stop Ultron; Pietro was killed during the battle but Wanda survived, and shortly after relocated to the New Avengers Facility in the United States.

During the Avengers Civil War, she sided with Captain America and was briefly imprisoned on the Raft before Rogers freed her alongside his teammates. Over the next two years, Maximoff reunited and reconciled with Vision, and together the two started living off the grid in Europe, forming a romantic relationship. However, the two soon came under threat from Thanos and the Black Order, who sought the Mind Stone. After being ambushed by the Black Order, they sought refuge in Wakanda with the remaining Avengers. Maximoff took part in the city's defense when the Black Order invaded the city, and died in the Snap after Thanos completed the Infinity Gauntlet. After the victims of the Snap were resurrected in 2023, Maximoff was among the many heroes who fought during the Battle of Earth, defeating Thanos and his armies.

Soon after, Maximoff became overwhelmed by immense grief from her recent personal losses, unwittingly unleashing her powers to create an alternate idyllic paradise of classical sitcom tropes within the town of Westview. She enthralled its inhabitants as cast members, and cut the town off from the outside world through an energy field. With a recreated Vision as her husband, Maximoff lived her ideal life, even producing twin sons, Tommy and Billy. Further complicating the crisis was Agatha Harkness, a fellow witch who sought to understand the nature of Maximoff's new reality, and S.W.O.R.D., an organization led by Tyler Hayward who wished to eliminate her. After defeating Harkness and the S.W.O.R.D. agents, Maximoff dispelled her reality, erasing her family in the process. Realizing the amount of damage she had done to Westview, Maximoff fled into isolation, and began studying the Darkhold.

Biography
Early Life
A Love for Sitcoms
Wanda Maximoff was born in 1989 in Sokovia to Oleg and Iryna Maximoff along with her twin brother, Pietro. Unknown to any of them, Maximoff was born with the latent magical ability to harness Chaos Magic, making her the legendary Scarlet Witch. Her power was too weak, however, and was doomed only to diminish over time. Growing up, her family would watch American by-products such as television series and sitcoms to practice their English. Maximoff became incredibly fond of the sitcoms, in particular, The Dick Van Dyke Show, enjoying and desiring the idyllic lives they depicted.

Novi Grad Bombings
Maximoff watching sitcoms with her family
At the age of 10, during the violent bombings in Sokovia, when her father got home, Maximoff chose for her family to watch The Dick Van Dyke Show for TV night, as it was her favorite. Suddenly, a mortar shell hit their apartment building, instantly killing Maximoff's parents.

The Maximoff twins survive the bombing
Trapped inside the crumbling building, Pietro Maximoff moved himself and his sister under the bed, where they witnessed a second shell land three feet in front of them. Maximoff noticed the TV still playing, so she used it to comfort herself. For the next two days, the twins stared at the shell, reading the name Stark Industries on it, fearing it would detonate at any moment, but it did not, and they were rescued. Maximoff and Pietro were subsequently admitted into a Sokovian orphanage. While there, they lived and interacted with a child who had a skin condition, which was particularly memorable for Maximoff.

Protesting Against Heroes
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff attend a protest
This horrifically traumatic experience gave the twins a deep enmity towards Tony Stark, and later, the Avengers, whom they aimed to take down. The Maximoffs dedicated much of their lives to this goal, including organizing protests against both Stark Industries and the Avengers, whom they blamed for their parents' deaths. Their constant political activity put Wanda and Pietro on S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA's radar as potential threats and allies, respectively.

Avengers Conflict
Joining HYDRA
Maximoff displaying her powers
By the time the twins reached adulthood, Sokovia had become a war zone, with foreign forces led by the United States of America invading their streets frequently. Maximoff and her brother took part in various riots to drive the Americans out of their home. What the twins did not realize was that the riots were orchestrated by HYDRA, who had taken up residence in the country and were using its upheavals to cover up their experiments. During one such riot, the Maximoffs were among the protesters approached by List, who offered them a way to achieve the power needed to end war in Sokovia.

Maximoff in Wolfgang von Strucker's base
Maximoff was initially skeptical, but ultimately convinced by Pietro to agree to the experiments to gain new powers. Along with other volunteers from the town, Maximoff and Pietro underwent a series of tests conducted by List and Wolfgang von Strucker, where they were exposed to energy from the Scepter, which had fatal effects on all the other volunteers. The Maximoff twins, however, survived and experienced exceedingly different side-effects. The power of the scepter then unlocked latent supernatural powers within the pair; Pietro achieved superhuman speed, while Maximoff attained a number of psionic powers. Unknown to her at the time, this event unlocked and amplified the latent Chaos Magic within her, fulfilling the myth of the Scarlet Witch.

Attack on the Research Base
The Maximoffs preparing to fight the Avengers
The Avengers arrived in Sokovia and raided HYDRA Research Base, stealing the Scepter and arresting Wolfgang von Strucker. In the confusion, Maximoff twins escaped from their holding cells and, though inexperienced, were able to use their powers to evade the Avengers and escape. 

Maximoff attacks Captain America
While Pietro went outside and engaged Hawkeye, Maximoff stayed inside and defended Strucker. When Strucker became cornered by Captain America, he attempted to surrender. However, Maximoff snuck up behind Rogers and used her powers to throw him down the stairs. In the confusion, Maximoff escaped through a doorway. Rogers reported to the rest of the Avengers of the second enhanced individual on HYDRA's side before knocking out Strucker and taking him into custody.

Maximoff uses her powers against Tony Stark
Maximoff used her powers to briefly distract Tony Stark, tricking him into believing that a dead Leviathan specimen that Strucker had been studying was still alive, and showing him a dark vision where the Avengers were dead and the Chitauri invaded Earth from a Wormhole. Upon seeing Stark's true fear of leading humanity down the path to global destruction, Maximoff allowed Stark and the Avengers to make off with the Scepter, despite Pietro's protests, with hopes that Stark's tampering with the alien weapon would lead to his own self-destruction.

Joining Ultron
The Maximoffs hide out in Sokovia
With the HYDRA Research Base and Wolfgang von Strucker captured, the Maximoffs returned to Sokovia, where Pietro provided for them by becoming a thief. One night, Maximoff found Pietro handing out items he had stolen, including an expensive Parisian dress to Zrinka. She mocked her brother's attempts to flirt with all the women in Sokovia and warned him he would get shot if he kept stealing. As Pietro began to question Maximoff's decision to let Tony Stark go free, Costel approached the pair and told them that "Iron Man" was waiting in a nearby church for them.

The Maximoffs meet Ultron
The twins went to the church and found a mysterious man waiting for them wearing a red cloak who spoke about how much he enjoyed the church. When Maximoff grew wary and questioned why she could not read his mind, the man revealed himself to be Ultron, an A.I. accidentally created by Tony Stark who subsequently went rogue and began a murderous vendetta against the Avengers. Ultron then led the Maximoffs from the church and back to the HYDRA Research Base.

Maximoff is recruited by Ultron
Ultron revealed that he had taken over the base and was using it to create an army of Ultron Sentries. They discussed the reasons for killing the Avengers and Pietro told Ultron how they had lost their parents due to a Stark Industries missile; Maximoff noted that she and Pietro nearly died at Stark's hand as well. Although they were initially unsure, Ultron assured the twins that they would use their powers to kill the Avengers, noting that while he and Pietro could hurt them, Maximoff would be able to tear them apart from the inside.

Battle at the Salvage Yard
Maximoff threatening Ulysses Klaue's mind
Agreeing to the alliance, Maximoff twins accompanied Ultron in acquiring Ulysses Klaue's supply of vibranium. The Maximoffs entered the Salvage Yard first and shut off the lights before disarming Klaue and confronting him. Klaue remained unimpressed by the Maximoffs. Having heard of them already, he noted that he was saddened to hear of Wolfgang von Strucker's death then mocked the pair for their reaction to learning of their mentor's murder.

Maximoff subdues Ulysses Klaue's henchman
Eventually, Klaue told the pair that he would have no respect for them if Maximoff used her powers to make him see what he feared, a cuttlefish, and he wished to speak to the man in charge. In response Ultron threw Klaue through a window and introduced himself. Ultron forced Klaue to sell him his stockpile of vibranium and paid him billions of dollars. However, when Klaue offended Ultron, the robot responded by cutting off Klaue's arm and kicking him down some stairs while Maximoff used her powers to keep Klaue's men from defending themselves.

Maximoff and Ultron fighting all the Avengers
When the Avengers arrived in an attempt to stop them, Ultron and the Maximoffs mocked their efforts, ignoring Captain America's attempts to convince the Maximoffs that they still had a chance to walk away. Ultron responded by attacking the team and the Maximoffs joined the fight. During the chaos of the battle, Maximoff managed to knock Captain America back with her powers and began "hexing" the minds of Thor, Black Widow, and Captain America. She attempted to enthrall Hawkeye but was subdued when he pushed a taser arrow onto her forehead.

Maximoff catches sight of Bruce Banner
Pietro saved her in the nick of time, throwing Hawkeye through a window and taking her outside Klaue's base to recover. Although she suffered great pain from the taser arrow, Maximoff wished to complete their plan. She caught sight of Bruce Banner and managed to "hex" him as well, forcing him to transform into the Hulk and go on a rampage through Johannesburg, resulting in Iron Man being forced to battle his friend. In the confusion, the twins managed to escape with Ultron and the vibranium, and made their way to Seoul.

Ultron's Intentions Revealed
Maximoff learns of Ultron's true intentions
When the trio arrived in Seoul, Ultron used the Scepter to indoctrinate Helen Cho, forcing her to use the vibranium in synchrony with the Regeneration Cradle to build a new, more powerful body for Ultron. As Ultron's consciousness was being uploaded into the body, Maximoff curiously took the opportunity to explore Ultron's mind and was horrified to learn of Ultron's true plans, which involved the genocide of humanity in its entirety. Maximoff freed Cho from the mind control to halt the creation of Ultron's body. With Pietro, she then abandoned Ultron and fled the facility, much to the automaton's rage.

Battle of Seoul
The Maximoffs decide to assist the Avengers
The twins attempted to escape Seoul, but as they made their way through the city, they spotted a news report showing that the Avengers were battling Ultron and his army in the middle of the city, endangering thousands of lives. Refusing to allow the people of Seoul to be put in danger, the Maximoffs decided to join the Avengers.

Maximoff saves Captain America from Ultron
They eventually caught up and assisted Captain America in fighting off Ultron on a moving passenger train. Maximoff used her powers to put a defensive barrier between Ultron and Rogers by twisting the metal bars inside the train while Pietro knocked him down. Upon seeing that he was betrayed and outnumbered by his former teammates, Ultron responded by destroying the controls of the train before flying out the side door and escaping, leaving the Maximoffs and Rogers on the train going full speed as it headed to the end of the tracks.

Maximoff using her abilities to stop the train
With the train now completely out of control and heading to the middle of the city, Rogers ordered Maximoff to stop it, while Pietro moved any civilians out of its path. Mustering up all of her power and strength, Maximoff lifted the train's wheels off the ground and applied the breaks as hard as she could. Although the train was slowing down, it still crashed through buildings. Pietro was able to save the lives of the people in the way until the train was finally stopped in its tracks.

Maximoff warns Steve Rogers of Tony Stark
With the train now stopped, Maximoff ran to her brother's aid, as he could barely stand after running so fast for so long. When Rogers revealed that the Regeneration Cradle and Ultron's would-be body had been sent to Tony Stark for analysis, Maximoff was disturbed, aware that Stark would attempt to utilize the body rather than destroy it in order to correct his own folly. Although Rogers was reluctant to accept this as a possibility, noting that Stark was not crazy, Maximoff compared Stark and Ultron and made key comparisons with their mindsets.

Changing Sides
The Birth of Vision
Maximoff prepares to attack Tony Stark
The Maximoff twins then accompanied Captain America back to the Avengers Tower and found Maximoff's fear to be accurate; Tony Stark and Bruce Banner were trying to upload the consciousness of J.A.R.V.I.S. into the body. After a brief scuffle, Maximoff was held back by Banner but she managed to escape his hold, only to witness Thor bringing the body to life.

Maximoff speaks to Vision
She watched in fear as the being initially attacked Thor before looking over New York City and calming down. The being introduced himself to them, calling itself Vision. The Maximoffs and the Avengers continued to be wary of Vision, with Maximoff noting that she had seen the destruction of the world in its head. Eventually, Vision convinced the team that he was on their side and proved his worthiness by picking up Mjølnir and handing it to Thor.

Maximoff joins the Avengers
She and Pietro then agreed to join the Avengers stopping Ultron and saving Sokovia, where he would be enacting his final plan. The Maximoffs took new uniforms and joined the Avengers on the Quinjet as Rogers gave a speech where he informed the team that their priority was getting the innocent people of Sokovia out of harm's way before Ultron could destroy their homes and lives. Wishing to save the lives of her friends from her home city, Maximoff sided with her former enemies, although she was unsure of trusting the Avengers in the long term.

Battle of Sokovia
Maximoff and Quicksilver arriving in Sokovia
Upon arriving in Sokovia, Maximoff played a significant part in evacuating civilians from Novi Grad, using her powers of mind control on dozens of innocents and leading them safely from the war zone. When the army of Ultron Sentries began their attack, Maximoff took up a defensive position on a bridge, shielding innocent civilians from enemy fire with her powers as they ran to safety, however, the firepower of the Sentries proved too strong and knocked her back.

Maximoff watches Novi Grad rising
Eventually, Ultron, using a device forged from the remaining vibranium samples, forced a large part of the city of Novi Grad to levitate so that once it reached a certain height, it would cause an extinction level event once it made an impact with the Earth. As Ultron gave a speech to the people of Sokovia while flying outside the city, Wanda and the rest of the Avengers could only look on in horror as Ultron unleashed his seemingly unstoppable plan.

Rescued by Hawkeye
Maximoff listens to Hawkeye's speech
This, along with the carnage that was falling upon the city, overwhelmed Maximoff. Hawkeye managed to lead her into a vacant building for safety from the Ultron Sentries. Maximoff struggled with terror and guilt over causing such a disaster in her own home, perceiving it as being her fault and beginning to lose morale.

Maximoff is inspired by Hawkeye's words
However, Hawkeye brushed aside Maximoff's guilt for the time being and simply responded that she needed to make a choice: either stay hidden and wait for her brother to take her somewhere safe or continue the battle. Hawkeye assured Maximoff that if she continued to fight to the end with them, then her past would not matter because she would become an Avenger. As Hawkeye then went back outside to battle Ultron, Maximoff was left to think over what he told her.

Becoming an Avenger
Maximoff fights back against Ultron
Her confidence restored by Hawkeye's words, Maximoff stepped outside and saved the overwhelmed Hawkeye from a small squad of Ultron Sentries, using her powers to pull them apart and throw them across Novi Grad.

Maximoff and Hawkeye clear the Sentries
Once the Sentries were destroyed, the pair reported to Captain America and prepared for their next mission. As they began to walk through the city, Quicksilver ran in and picked up his sister, running across the city with her while leaving Barton to jog behind.

The Maximoffs fight against Ultron's army
Maximoff and Quicksilver ran into the middle of the city and teamed up to assist in the battle by protecting civilians still trapped in the city, running ahead of Sokovian Police Department officers who were pinned down by the Ultron Sentries. While Maximoff fired energy blasts at the robots, Quicksilver ran into the battle but was accidentally grazed in the arm by a police officer despite the chief calling for the police to stop firing.

Maximoff discusses the plan
Rogers informed the Avengers that they are leading the civilians to the town hall. He met up with Maximoff and Black Widow, who asked why Maximoff was wearing her jacket. Captain America told her that Maximoff was with them now. Hawkeye then caught up with them and warned that if they got any higher, people would start dropping. Captain America ordered Maximoff to get the civilians out from hiding, and for Hawkeye to watch her back.

Maximoff evacuates the people of Sokovia
Soon after, a Helicarrier commanded by Nick Fury and Maria Hill came to the Avengers' aide, sending out Lifeboats to evacuate the civilians still trapped at the city. Once the transports landed, Maximoff assisted in escorting civilians to the Lifeboats that ferried them aboard the flying aircraft carrier, keeping the women and children back until it was safe and ushering them on board alongside Hawkeye. Meanwhile, Fury sent War Machine to protect the Lifeboats from any Sentries attacking them mid-air.

Protecting the Key
The Maximoffs challenge Ultron
Maximoff, Quicksilver and the rest of the Avengers regrouped at the church in the center of Novi Grad where Ultron had set up the key to the device that would cause the city to drop. Captain America explained that Ultron must not be allowed to activate the key as it would destroy the city and the planet. As they stood around the key, Ultron hovered outside the church. When Thor challenged him, Ultron showed off his army of hundreds of Ultron Sentries.

Maximoff fights the Ultron Sentries
When Ultron unleashed his army upon them, Maximoff and the Avengers put all their might into battling the seemingly endless horde of Ultron Sentries, with Maximoff using her gifts to pull them out of the air and rip them apart from the inside. Eventually the team managed to wipe out the majority of Ultron's drones and Ultron himself was almost destroyed by the combined might of Vision, Thor, Iron Man, and the Hulk, who destroyed his armor and sent him across the city.

Maximoff agrees to protect the key
With the battle almost won, Captain America ordered the team to evacuate the city before Iron Man and Thor destroyed the key and Novi Grad itself. As the key needed to be guarded against Ultron in the meantime, Maximoff volunteered to stay behind, telling Hawkeye that it was her job to protect it. The team agreed but Quicksilver insisted that he would not leave her behind, but she ordered him to continue getting the people to the boats and only come back for her at the last minute, insisting she could handle the responsibility.

Quicksilver's Sacrifice
Maximoff senses Quicksilver's death
While keeping the Ultron Sentries away from the key, Maximoff sensed a terrible thing, as her brother attempted to save Hawkeye and a young boy from Ultron, who had obtained a Quinjet, he was shot and killed by the robot. Sensing this, Maximoff dropped to her knees and cried out in pure anguish, obliterating the sentries she had been fighting with a single massive blast of energy.

Maximoff gets her revenge on Ultron
Overcome with rage and emotion, Maximoff left her post to avenge her brother, tracking down Ultron, who had been ripped out of the Quinjet by the Hulk and had crash-landed inside a bus. Maximoff knelt beside her former ally, who pleaded with her to escape before she was killed in the approaching explosion, Maximoff told the robot that she had already died due to heartbreak and to demonstrate this, she telekinetically ripped his core processor from his body.

Maximoff is saved by Vision
Her action inadvertently allowed a single Ultron drone to activate the device, sending Novi Grad plummeting towards Earth with her still trapped inside. Maximoff accepted her fate as she plummeted towards the ground, being the only person left in the city; however, she was rescued at the last minute by Vision. Seconds after their escape, Iron Man and Thor averted the cataclysm by combining their abilities to vaporize the city, saving billions of lives.

New Avengers
Moving to the United States
Maximoff arriving at the Avengers Facility
The ordeal with Ultron having finally passed, Maximoff was recruited into the Avengers' roster along with James Rhodes, Vision and Sam Wilson as a permanent member of the team. Maximoff was also provided with a new uniform to wear as an Avenger.

Maximoff officially joins the Avengers
They arrived at the New Avengers Facility and began their training under the leadership of Captain America and Black Widow. HYDRA collected many of the parts of the destroyed Ultron Sentries and took them to an undisclosed location in Eastern Europe, where they used the parts to create a giant robot called Ultimo. HYDRA then used the Ultimo to attack a small village. Maximoff joined the Avengers in an attack on the giant robot and together they managed to destroy Ultimo.

Bonding with Vision
Maximoff watching sitcoms to comfort her
Still grieving the loss of her brother, Maximoff, who was all alone in a new place, would watch sitcoms in her bedroom to comfort herself. When she sensed Vision on the other side of the wall, he entered, apologizing for intruding, but she asked him to sit next to her and watch TV.

Maximoff and Vision starting to fall in love
As they watched the TV, Vision expressed a desire to learn about Maximoff's sadness, if that would bring her comfort, but she didn't think it would, only wanting her brother back. However, Maximoff decided to open up to Vision, explaining the overwhelming sorrow she was feeling, but he believed that it wouldn't always be that way, and that he saw it as love persevering, despite his lack of experiencing loss, noting he has never had a loved one. This cheered Maximoff up, and caused her to develop strong feelings for Vision, as they continued to watch TV, enjoying it together.

Lagos Catastrophe
Maximoff undercover at a café
Approximately a year after the Ultron Offensive, Maximoff joined her fellow Avengers in tracking down Crossbones and his mercenaries to Lagos, Nigeria. Maximoff positioned herself at a café, where she described the police station in the area, trying to uncover Crossbones' plan as part of her training from Black Widow, who was teaching her spy techniques.

Maximoff battles all Crossbones' soldiers
They soon learned that Crossbones was planning to instead attack the Institute for Infectious Diseases and steal a biochemical weapon. Captain America then ordered them to make their way to the IFID to stop the attack. The Avengers immediately rushed towards the IFID, with Captain America arriving first on the scene, followed by Falcon and Maximoff, and took out the outside mercenaries. Maximoff lifted Captain America onto the third floor to subdue Crossbones and used her powers to vent the anaesthetic gas out into the open air.

Maximoff clears the gas from the building
Falcon and Black Widow managed to neutralize the mercenaries and secure the biochemical weapon that Crossbones had obtained while they tried to escape through a busy marketplace. Captain America and Crossbones fought intensely before Captain America managed to disarm and subdue Crossbones. Crossbones taunted Captain America and claimed that the Winter Soldier had hired him to steal the biochemical weapon, once again under HYDRA's mind control.

Maximoff accidentally blows up a building
Maximoff arrived at the scene when suddenly, Crossbones pulled the cord on his suicide vest in an effort to kill both him and Captain America. She managed to temporarily contain the explosion around Crossbones and tried to move its impact away by propelling him into the air. However, Maximoff inadvertently destroyed a nearby building with the blast, killing many of its occupants, much to her horror. As she teared up in the streets, Black Widow arrived to comfort her.

Feeling the Guilt
Maximoff watching the news report about her
The Avengers returned to the New Avengers Facility, where a month later, Maximoff still struggled with guilt over the deaths caused by the explosion. She watched a news report on the aftermath of the attack in Lagos questioning her ability to even operate in Nigeria.

Maximoff is comforted by Steve Rogers
Steve Rogers tried to assure the young woman that it was not her fault, saying he should have taken apart Crossbones' suicide vest before it went off. Not totally convinced, Maximoff stated they were both at fault then, to which Rogers reminded her that despite the casualties, they were able to stop Crossbones from killing more. The two were interrupted by Vision, whom Maximoff scolded for once again phasing through the wall to get into her room instead of using the door. Vision apologized and informed Rogers that Tony Stark had arrived with Thaddeus Ross at the Facility.

Avengers Civil War
Sokovia Accords
Maximoff learns of the Sokovia Accords
Maximoff, along with the rest of the Avengers, met up with Thaddeus Ross and Tony Stark who introduced them to the Sokovia Accords, a set of internationally ratified legal documents that provides regulation and a framework for the military/law enforcement deployment of enhanced individuals which included Maximoff.

Maximoff is shown footage of the recent fight
Ross showed footage from battles that the Avengers fought in, showing the destruction and death that followed. When Ross showed them footage from the aftermath of their fight with Crossbones in Lagos, Nigeria, Maximoff felt the guilt seeing the damage that she blamed herself for.

The Avengers discuss the Sokovia Accords
As the Avengers privately discussed the Accords, Maximoff was unsure at the time whether she should sign or not but stayed mostly silent during the discussion. When Stark told them about Charlie Spencer, a victim from the Battle of Sokovia, Maximoff once again felt uneasy due to her tragic past with Sokovia. When she brought up the fact that she would be hunted if they didn't sign, Vision assured her that they would protect her.

Maximoff displays her abilities towards Vision
While the other Avengers left to deal with Winter Soldier and attend the meeting in Vienna, Maximoff stayed at the facility under the watch of Vision. Vision tried to cook her something to lift her spirits, though his inexperience with food left it wanting. The two Avengers had a heart-to-heart about their powers and how they are feared by others, but when Maximoff tried to leave the facility, Vision stopped her, telling her that Stark had asked him to ensure she did not leave the compound until the debate with the Accords were over.

Rescued by Hawkeye
Maximoff and Hawkeye are stopped by Vision
Later, Steve Rogers sent Clint Barton to retrieve Maximoff from the Avengers Facility where she was being supervised by Vision. Barton created an explosion outside to distract Vision. As Maximoff watched Vision, she sensed a presence behind her and launched a knife at the intruder, stopping her attack when she realized it was Barton. Barton told her that they need to go as Captain America needed their help to fight against the Sokovia Accords; as they were leaving, Vision returned and stopped them.

Scarlet Witch is forced to subdue Vision
Approaching the two, the trap that Barton had set up went off, paralyzing Vision with electricity. Barton began to leave again, but Maximoff hesitated because she believed that she had caused enough damage. Barton tries to convince her to leave when Vision breaks free and he and Barton begin to fight. Vision easily overpowers Barton, but Barton looks to Maximoff for help.

Scarlet Witch manages to subdue Vision
Maximoff tells Vision to release Barton and that she is leaving; Vision tells her he can not allow her to. Using her powers to control the Mind Stone to force him to phase and release Barton. Vision warns Maximoff that if she leaves that she will be feared by everyone but Maximoff tells Vision that she can only control her own fear and then blasts Vision many meters beneath the facility. With Vision subdued, Maximoff finally left with Barton en route to Germany to retrieve Scott Lang.

Recruiting Scott Lang
Maximoff regroups with Steve Rogers in Berlin
After incapacitating Vision, Maximoff and Clint Barton went to go retrieve Scott Lang who had been recommended by Sam Wilson. The three were waiting in a van in Berlin when Rogers arrived. He thanked Maximoff for having his back and Maximoff replied that she needed to get off her ass, reflecting what Barton told her earlier.

Maximoff brings Scott Lang to Steve Rogers

When they introduced Lang to Rogers, Maximoff watched as Lang awkwardly talked with Rogers, then praised her as well. Later, an announcement was made saying the airport was being evacuated due to Tony Stark. The group all suited up and made their way to the Leipzig-Halle Airport where they would depart to Siberia.
Clash of the Avengers
Maximoff and Hawkeye inside of the airport
Captain America and his team headed to the Leipzig-Halle Airport where a helicopter was waiting to take them to Siberia. However, anticipating an ambush, from Iron Man, they split up--Maximoff with Hawkeye. They positioned themselves inside the airport, and watched as Captain America was immediately surrounded. After Hawkeye freed Captain America, breaking the webs with an arrow, the two made their way to stay away from the conflict.

Maximoff successfully subduing Iron Man
However, they were spotted by Iron Man, who pursued them as they tried to escape, firing several missiles near them. Iron Man then confronted them and told Maximoff that she hurt Vision's feelings, and they argued about why she had been locked up. While Hawkeye was distracting Iron Man, Maximoff used her powers to launch several vehicles as projectiles in the parking garage behind him, finally burying him and buying them time to escape.

Maximoff runs with Captain America's team
Maximoff and Hawkeye managed to make their way to Captain America and his team, so they could get to the Quinjet that would take them to Siberia. As they made their way to the Quinjet, they were stopped by Vision, who fired a laser beam in front of them. He then warned them to stop, as the rest of Iron Man's team regrouped. The two teams stood on opposite sides of each other as they prepared to fight.

Fighting Former Teammates
Maximoff fights against Spider-Man
The battle between the Avengers then begun with the two teams charging at each other. Maximoff launched herself into the air towards Iron Man's team where she targeted Spider-Man by hurtling asphalt from the ground and nearby objects directly towards him, which he was able to evade.

Maximoff manages to save Hawkeye
Due to her abilities, and not being a physical fighter, Maximoff focused on protecting her allies whenever they would be subdued. As Black Widow and Hawkeye fought, Maximoff interfered with Widow's blow by pinioning her limb and then throwing her away from Hawkeye. Before moving on, she told Hawkeye to stop pulling his punches and proceeded to her next fight.

Maximoff saves Bucky Barnes' life

When Black Panther and Bucky Barnes engaged in a fight, which Black Panther had the intent on killing him, Maximoff managed to narrowly stop him by blocking his claws from tearing out Barnes' throat. Having halted Black Panther's attacks, Maximoff then tossed him away from Barnes, keeping him safe.
Winning a Losing Battle
Maximoff fighting against War Machine
As Iron Man's team pressed on, Falcon realized they could not win the battle and get everyone to Siberia. So, Hawkeye confirmed that only Captain America and Bucky Barnes could get to Siberia while the rest of the team stayed behind. To distract Iron Man's team, Ant-Man transformed into "Giant-Man," focusing the opposition on defeating him rather than stopping Captain America and Barnes from reaching the Quinjet.

Maximoff getting attacked by War Machine
However, War Machine managed to evade Giant-Man and pursued the two until Maximoff started hurling large objects at him, keeping him from reaching the hangar. Vision destroyed a traffic control tower so Captain America and Barnes could not escape but Maximoff used her powers to hold back the debris for them to pass. Seeing this, War Machine used a Stark Sonic Cannon to knock her out, causing the tower to fall.

Maximoff being comforted by Vision
After the battle, Vision went to check on Maximoff, and they apologized to each other. As Vision comforted Maximoff, War Machine requested Vision's back up in disabling Falcon's wing thrusters. Distracted, Vision accidentally grazed War Machine's arc reactor, disabling the suit and causing him to fall from the sky, paralyzing him upon impact, therefore letting Captain America and Barnes fly away to Siberia.

Imprisoned in the Raft
Maximoff in the Raft
After their defeat, Maximoff, Clint Barton, Sam Wilson, and Scott Lang were arrested by Thaddeus Ross and imprisoned in the Raft. Maximoff was the only one outfitted with a shock collar and put in a strait-jacket to prevent her using her powers. When Tony Stark visited the prison, he was disturbed to see Maximoff's condition.

Maximoff imprisoned in the Raft
Steve Rogers eventually infiltrated the Raft and freed Maximoff, Barton, Wilson, and Lang from their cells. Following her liberation, Maximoff opted to leave Rogers, Wilson, and Natasha Romanoff and stay in hiding in Scotland. There she reunited with Vision. When Vision stayed with her, he would take a human form and turn off any trackers, so the two could be with each other.

Infinity War
Attack on Vision
Maximoff and Vision spend time together
One night in 2018, Vision began to feel an alert from the Mind Stone in his forehead, asking Maximoff to use her powers to feel it. She claimed that all she felt was him and the two embraced each other. They then went outside where Maximoff informed Vision of train times so that he could return to the Avengers Compound. Vision began suggesting that they form their own life together, which she was unsure about due to the promises they had made to their respective teams.

Maximoff battling Proxima Midnight
Before she could give her official answer, she noticed a SBN news report about an alien attack in New York City and the report of Tony Stark being missing. Vision prepared to leave, intending to join the fight, but Maximoff was reluctant to let him leave because she knew his life would be put at significant risk. Moments before he was about to reply to her, Vision was attacked by Corvus Glaive and Maximoff was thrown away into a store by an energy blast from Proxima Midnight.

Maximoff attempts to protect Vision
They then began to forcefully remove the Stone from Vision's forehead, but Maximoff was able to fight them off. Maximoff attempted to escape with Vision and temporarily hid from Midnight and Glaive before they were found. Maximoff faced Midnight and barely managed to hold her own while Vision unsuccessfully fought Glaive on top of a church. When Vision again became subdued, Maximoff rescued him from Glaive and attempted to escape with Vision again by flight, but the two were blasted out of the air by Midnight and cornered in an empty train station.

Maximoff notices Steve Rogers' arrival
Maximoff prepared to be the final line of defense for Vision, until Steve Rogers arrived, joined by Sam Wilson and Natasha Romanoff, who, with relative ease, managed to defeat Midnight and Glaive, but they escaped. Rogers decided that they had to return to the Avengers Compound in hopes of developing a plan to help Vision and gaining more information about their extraterrestrial attackers and Maximoff helped Vision into the Quinjet.

Trying to Save Vision
Maximoff returns to the New Avengers Facility
Maximoff, Vision, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson arrived at the New Avengers Facility and reunited with James Rhodes and Bruce Banner. They then discussed the rising threat. Vision came to the conclusion that the only way to make sure that the Stone wouldn’t be taken was if it was destroyed by Maximoff.

Maximoff disagrees with Vision's proposal
However, she rejected this idea, knowing it would kill him in the process. Despite Vision's persistence, Banner produced an alternative idea that entailed removing the Stone, keeping Vision alive through the other components of his creation. However, this could not be done by Banner, so Rogers suggested that they go to Wakanda.

Maximoff listening to Shuri
Maximoff flew via Quinjet with the team to Wakanda. Once there, they sought the aid of Shuri, the sister of T'Challa. As Vision was scanned by Shuri, Maximoff asked if she would be able to remove the Stone. She told her that she could, but it would be difficult due to the two trillions neurons that needed to be dealt with carefully.

Maximoff contemplates joining in the battle
Suddenly, a swarm of Outrider Dropships landed outside the dome, causing everyone to go outside to defend Vision. Rogers ordered Maximoff to destroy the Stone as soon as it was removed from Vision, tasking her to stay there. Maximoff stood by Vision as he underwent the removal of the Stone. However, after witnessing the arrival of Threshers, she realized she had to be out there.

Battle of Wakanda
Maximoff joining the battle in Wakanda
Maximoff then left and flew out to the battlefield, where she saved Black Widow and Okoye by stopping the incoming Threshers and threw them on top of the Outriders. However, her presence of the battlefield allowed Proxima Midnight to notify Corvus Glaive that Vision was left unguarded by her. When Falcon pointed out Vision being in danger, Maximoff went to help him, but was struck in the head by Midnight, causing her to fall into a ditch.

Maximoff lifts and kills Proxima Midnight
Midnight then taunted Maximoff as she prepared to kill her, but was stopped when Black Widow and Okoye intervened. The two fought off the alien, as Maximoff recovered from the powerful blow she received. As the fight continued, the two found themselves overwhelmed by Midnight, who came close to killing Black Widow. However, Maximoff was able to step in and use her powers to stop Midnight by launching her into an incoming Thresher, ultimately killing her. Following this, she quickly returned to Vision's side to protect him.

Thanos' Victory
Maximoff being told to destroy the stone
Vision then sensed Thanos' arrival, causing everyone to be prepared, as they witnessed him appear through a portal. Maximoff was about to join the fight, but Vision told her that she had to destroy the stone. She continued to refuse to do so, but he begged her to, knowing it was the only way to thwart Thanos' plans. Vision then comforted her as she understood what had to be done, still greatly upset about doing it. He reassured her, stating that she could never hurt him and repeating her earlier words, "I just feel you."

Maximoff keeping Thanos away
In tears, Maximoff reluctantly unleashed a stream of psionic energy into the Stone while the other Avengers made futile attempts to stop Thanos. After easily defeating the Avengers, Thanos began to approach Maximoff and Vision. She then struck him with a separate stream of energy to stall him further, slowing him down significantly, before managing to destroy the Stone just as he was about to reach them. The Mind Stone shattered, releasing a huge blast of energy that knocked Maximoff to the ground and destroyed Vision's body.

Maximoff watches the restoration of Vision
As Maximoff laid on the ground, heartbroken, Thanos empathized with her pain, understanding the sacrifice of what she most loved. She bitterly stated that he knew nothing. She then watched in horror as Thanos used the Time Stone to restore Vision with the clear intent to rip the Mind Stone from his head. Maximoff attempted to stop him, but Thanos swatted her aside with little effort and ripped the Stone from Vision's head, killing him a second time. Now equipped with the final Mind Stone, the Infinity Gauntlet was complete.
