Wilson Grant Fisk is a powerful businessman with interests in the future of New York City by controlling the crime waves which brought him into conflict with some of his partners who betrayed him, as well as fighting the new vigilante Daredevil. His attempt to destroy and rebuild Hell's Kitchen was ruined when his criminal activities were leaked to the FBI, leading to his arrest. Fisk's own criminal career did not end at his arrest. Within Ryker's Island, Fisk began building up a loyal band of criminals and came to run the prison. Seeking to destroy the crime competition in New York by the time he got free, Fisk then assisted with the Punisher's escape, as he had desired to eliminate competing criminal empires as the new Kingpin. This soon put Fisk in a conflict with Nelson and Murdock who incarcerated him.

Desiring his freedom, Fisk then set about a plan to exploit the FBI by leaking criminals in New York City, in order to then be placed in the Presidential Hotel where Fisk could continue with all of his criminal activities, while focusing most of his efforts on exposing Matt Murdock as Daredevil. From a new position of strength, Fisk then began to blackmail and to manipulate multiple agents, including Benjamin Poindexter to aid him with framing Daredevil as the terrorist, while he also ensured that his name was cleared within the eyes of the law to ensure that Vanessa Marianna could return to him. However, Fisk's schemes were finally thwarted by the posthumous testimony of Ray Nadeem, while Poindexter learnt about Fisk's manipulation of him, as Daredevil and Poindexter fought and had eventually defeated Fisk, resulting in him and Marianna then being returned back into prison.

Biography
Early Life
Raised through Abuse
Wilson Fisk was born in New York City to a caring mother and an ambitious but cruel father. Fisk remained fairly immature, never staying up past midnight, catching the subway on his own or going anywhere outside from New York. From that young age, Fisk was taught about an abusive form of respect, where his own father demanded his respect but abused his mother for stepping out of line in his view. Fisk constantly had this strong view of his father, always seeing him as the prime figurehead of their family, in spite of his mother still trying to maintain their financial situation and his father's dealings with Don Rigoletto in an attempt to make ends meet for them.

Lessons in Violence
Fisk being given advice from his father
When Fisk was young, his father Bill Fisk had run for the New York City Council, believing it would make him and his family rich having seen this happen for other people around them in New York City. Wilson, at the age of twelve, was tasked with helping out his father with putting signs together to promote his campaign while his mother dealt with the finance. One day while making signs, Fisk's father allowed him to take a drink of whiskey to prove he was a man, but when Fisk choked he was mocked by his father who laughed in his face.

Fisk is comforted by his mother after a fight
Despite the work that their family put in, the campaign was soon a complete failure, with Bill Fisk losing out to his rival and coming out feeling both angry and humiliated as well as looking for someone to take out this anger upon. Wilson had soon became ridiculed by his neighbor Bernie Walker, who began kicking down all of the signs for Fisk's campaign before hitting Fisk in the jaw for fighting back and attempting to defend his father's work during his political campaign. The upset Fisk quickly returned to his home where his mother cared for his cut lip and gave him food to make him feel better.

Fisk witnesses his father's violent nature
When his father found out about this assault, he then took the young Wilson to confront Walker in person. Fisk watched closely as his own father cornered and confronted the overconfident Walker until he became angry. Bill Fisk then assaulted Walker and managed to beat him to the ground by hitting him repeatedly with a baseball bat. Fisk was then ordered by his father to kick the defenseless Walker repeatedly, telling him that he had to prove that he was a man and willing to fight back. Fisk did as he was instructed and assaulted Walker repeatedly, as his father ordered him to continue kicking Walker.

Murdering His Father
Fisk getting harassed by his drunken father
Having lost his campaign, Bill Fisk's drinking habit got more out of hand as the pressure of owing money to local mobsters, including Don Rigoletto, got to him, and he began beating his wife, blaming her for everything that was wrong with his life. During these beatings, he would order Wilson to sit and stare at a blank wall and listen to his own mother scream in fear and pain as she was beaten repeatedly. The young Wilson remained fearful of his father, but hearing his mother's pain caused him to despise his father.

Fisk after brutally murdering his own father
During one of these beatings, Wilson decided to put an end to his beloved mother's suffering.  He grabbed a nearby hammer and repeatedly hit his father over the head with it, killing him and crushing his skull with hit after hit. His mother comforted Fisk and promised to protect him, deciding to then cut up the body. They began dumping it in the river every night for the next week, knowing that most people who knew them would blame Rigoletto for his disappearance. As a gift, Fisk was given his father's cufflinks, which he kept and wore for years afterward to remind himself of his father's true nature.

Criminal Enterprise
Away from Hell's Kitchen
In the wake of Fisk murdering his father, his mother sent him to live on a farm with relatives. Fisk later moved to Asia where he would spend most of his time abroad, something reflected in his behavior and clothing.

Many years later, Fisk returned to New York City and became a powerful criminal businessman, developing a plan to pull Hell's Kitchen apart and rebuild it. He took control over Don Rigoletto's criminal activities and recruited Leland Owlsley, the Russian Mafia, Nobu Yoshioka, and Madame Gao into his organization. He also developed a rivalry with the Kitchen Irish led by Nesbitt.

Meeting Vanessa Marianna
Fisk being introduced to Vanessa Marianna
Fisk visited Scene Contempo Gallery as he stared at a white painting, one which resembled the white wall that his father would force him to stare at as a child. While he had silently stared into the painting, Fisk was approached by Vanessa Marianna, one of the gallery's art dealers and the pair discussed the painting and what the meaning behind it was. When Marianna asked him how the painting made him feel, Fisk simply told her it made him feel alone. Fisk then agreed to purchase the painting and hung it in his Penthouse bedroom.

Fisk discusses Anatoly Ranskahov's actions
Fisk continued to think of Marianna and built up the courage to ask her out on a date. While outside the gallery in his limo, Fisk was briefly updated by James Wesley about their plans to buy out Veles Taxi, with Wesley noting that Anatoly Ranskahov seemed more open to the idea than his brother. They then briefly discussed the Man in the Mask, who had been causing them issues, and Fisk promised to find a way to kill him. As he prepared to step outside, Fisk ordered Wesley to stay with the car so he could deal with this alone as it was a more personal matter.

Fisk asking Vanessa Marianna out for dinner
Fisk returned alone to the Scene Contempo Gallery and soon found Vanessa Marianna, who was still working. They discussed what Fisk had done with the painting she had sold him, with Fisk explaining that it was up in his Penthouse bedroom so that it would be the last thing he saw every night and the first thing he saw in the morning. Fisk built up the courage to ask her to join him for dinner. Marianna told him that she was working all night but implored him to continue trying to convince her. Despite his shyness, Marianna happily agreed to join him for the dinner, provided that it was Italian food. She and Fisk then properly introduced themselves to each other.

Interrupted Date
Fisk has dinner with Vanessa Marianna
While enjoying their dinner together, the pair discussed their past. At one point, Vanessa Marianna mentioned Fisk's cufflinks, which he would often touch while speaking; Fisk told her that they were had previously belonged to his father's and he wore them to remember him. When Marianna noted that she had never known of this restaurant, this led to a discussion about the future of New York City's development, with Fisk explaining his own youth in the city before his mother had sent him away. Fisk went on to claim that the city was a part of him and he now wanted to make it a better place.

Fisk and Marianna discussing New York City
As the dinner wore on, the pair enjoyed each others' company more and more as Fisk recommended the Zuppa Inglese for Marianna to enjoy, which she accepted. However, as Fisk was being asked what sort of person he was to which he claimed to be just a man, they were suddenly interrupted when Anatoly Ranskahov charged into the restaurant, saying that he and his brother had accepted Fisk's offer to take over Russian Mafia. Desperate for Marianna not to learn of all his own criminal undertakings, Fisk then told her to leave with him and ordered James Wesley to put Ranskahov into the car.

Fisk says goodnight to Vanessa Marianna
Fisk walked Marianna back home and apologized for the interruption. Fisk asked if he would ever see her again. Marianna told Fisk that she usually does not date her customers, but she made an exception for him, not because of his money but because she felt that there was something different about him, which she now regretted. Fisk tried to apologize for the failure of the evening and asked if she had enjoyed her time with him; she told him that she did not know how she felt and went inside her apartment, leaving Fisk standing there heartbroken and alone before walking away in silence.

Murder of Anatoly Ranskahov
Fisk beating Anatoly Ranskahov to death
Furious to have been embarrassed, Fisk traveled to James Wesley's location and called him to ensure that he could ambush his target correctly. Fisk proceeded to drag Anatoly Ranskahov from the car and throw him into the mud. Fisk continued to brutally beat down Ranskahov in revenge for the embarrassment with Vanessa Marianna, eventually putting his head between the car door and hitting it repeatedly in a psychotic rage until Ranskahov's head was completely crushed.

Fisk prepares for war with the Russian Mafia
As Fisk stepped away from the corpse of his victim, Wesley handed him a handkerchief which he used to wipe the blood from his face. Looking down Fisk noticed that his suit had been damaged in the fight when Ranskahov had tried to fight back with a knife, so he told Wesley to contact Melvin Potter at his Workshop for a new one. As Wesley questioned what to do with Ranskahov's corpse, Fisk told him to send it to Vladimir Ranskahov. When Wesley mentioned that this killing would start a war with the Russian Mafia who would seek their revenge, Fisk told him that he was now counting on that.

War with the Russians
Fisk and Wesley meet with all their partners
While his car was being cleaned of all Anatoly Ranskahov's blood and brains, Fisk and James Wesley had a meeting with the remaining members of his organization, with Fisk apologizing for being absent for so long. Fisk explained to the group that the Russian Mafia was no longer a part of their organization since he had just removed his head with his own car door, and as a direct response to this, Vladimir Ranskahov would be seeking revenge. The group all showed horror and anger at the news, demanding to know why they were not consulted on the matter before this action was taken.

Fisk is calmly threatened by Nobu Yoshioka
With everyone furious at Fisk, Madame Gao asked what this meant in the movement of her Steel Serpent heroin without the Ranskahovs; however, Fisk told her to continue dealing with the Veles Taxi operation until he could completely take over their distribution from them, promising that he would split the profits between them all. Despite Leland Owlsley strongly questioning the arrangement, the group begrudgingly accepted the proposal. Nobu Yoshioka told Fisk on his way not to forget the promises he had made to him and all his known superiors in the Hand whom he represented.

Fisk privately speaking with Madame Gao
As the group left, with Owlsley complaining that with the Russian Mafia's rebellion and the Masked Man running around, he felt the need to get his stun gun back out from storage before driving away out of the garage with Yoshioka following closely behind him. Left alone, Fisk then approached Gao and offered her his arm as he walked her back to her car. Gao, however, believed he still wanted something from her, to which Fisk then insisted that he only wanted to put this situation behind them all as quickly as possible. She only smiled at this as they walked back to her car arm in arm.

Second Date
Fisk getting advice from James Wesley
Fisk invited Vanessa Marianna for a second dinner to make up for the disastrous first; beforehand, Fisk spoke to James Wesley about their recent events involving Piotr who attempted to rat out Fisk to the New York City Police Department an encounter with the Man in the Mask, but had been murdered by Christian Blake and Carl Hoffman who were busy ensuring that the rest of the NYPD did not learn of the connection between Russian Mafia and Fisk. As Fisk had prepared to leave, Wesley recommended a wine for Fisk to order inside the restaurant for his date with Marianna.

Fisk dines again with Vanessa Marianna
While Fisk sat alone and overlooked New York City, he waited, hoping that Marianna would give him a second chance. Eventually, Marianna did show up and was brought to Fisk by Marcel, although she still admitted that she had considered not coming at all, although she was impressed that Fisk had hired the entire restaurant to ensure they were not disturbed. Fisk assured her that, however, she wished the evening to go would be the way it would happen. He admitted that although he was a shy man who did not like being questioned or being in public; he would always be honest with Marianna.

Fisk takes Vanessa Marianna's handgun
The pair sat down for dinner and spoke about their own lives, with Marianna telling Fisk of a prince she had once been seduced by as she worked at the Scene Contempo Gallery, which clearly made Fisk uncomfortable to discuss. They briefly talked about why a man like Fisk felt alone, which Fisk blamed on the nature of his own business, which he claimed was rebuilding Hell's Kitchen. Fisk asked Marianna what was the model of the gun in her purse, asking her if she felt she would have needed it, with Marianna claiming that by not confessing what he really did he was then insulting her intelligence.

Fisk explains his vision for New York City
Marianna made it clear she knew he was involved in some criminal activities, so to win back her trust in him Fisk told her that he planned to change the city for the better with force, believing that it would not happen on its own. Fisk confessed to having hurt people and even admitted that he would hurt more soon, although he insisted that he took no pleasure in being cruel like his father had been. Fisk told her that the city needed to die, so it could finally be reborn into something better. Marianna then gave Fisk her gun, knowing that she was safe next to him as Fisk put the gun into his jacket.

Fisk and Marianna look over the burning city
During their dinner, Fisk's men detonated bombs in the warehouses of the Russians, killing most of them in the multiple blasts to ensure that Vladimir Ranskahov would fail in his attempt to destroy Fisk's organization to avenge Anatoly Ranskahov. As the city burned and the police sirens could be heard, Fisk and Marianna watched the fires from the window. To reassure her, Fisk told Marianna about the boy who had been kidnapped and rescued by the Masked Man, telling her that the kidnappers were now burning in the flames. On the way out, Fisk tipped Marcel and thanked him for the evening.

Speaking to the Masked Man
Fisk learns Vladimir Ranskahov has survived
After his date, Fisk joined James Wesley into their limousine; Wesley had received a call informing him that, although the Russian Mafia's strongholds had been destroyed, Vladimir Ranskahov had escaped with the help of the man in black. Fisk became nervous, knowing that Madame Gao would be disappointed that the situation had not yet been resolved, as he had promised it would. Fisk was later informed by Christian Blake that the man in the mask had seemingly taken Sullivan hostage into an Abandoned Warehouse with Ranskahov.

Fisk finally speaks with the Man in the Mask
Fisk ordered Blake to take down the man but was told this was more complicated since Ben Urich, who was now also on the scene, could expose the schemes. Fisk had ordered Urich to be shot in front of the cities' media. Fisk was given a police radio and used it to contact the man in black after Blake and Carl Hoffman had ensured that all other officers had changed channels. The man took the radio and the pair began speaking; Fisk told him they had a lot in common but the man simply insisted that they were nothing alike, and vowed that one day he would bring both him and his entire criminal empire to justice.

Fisk chooses to leave the Masked Man to die
Fisk told the man that his part in their drama would end that night, as the man would be blamed for these Bombings of Hell's Kitchen. Fisk offered him the chance to kill Ranskahov and go free, noting all of the crimes Ranskahov was guilty of. Fisk had then claimed he respected the man's convictions, but he would ensure that their city would turn on him; Fisk then ordered his men to shoot Urich and release footage of that man attacking police officers. Fisk had then told the man they would not speak again and hung up. He later learned that Ranskahov had been killed in the firefight, and the Masked Man escaped.

Difficult Choices
Experiencing Sleepless Nights
Fisk wakes up from yet another nightmare
Throughout his sleep inside his Penthouse, Fisk often found himself being haunted by nightmares of the night of his father's murder. Once awake and sitting on his bed in a cold sweat, Fisk would stare at the Rabbit in a Snowstorm he had bought from Vanessa Marianna at the Scene Contempo Gallery. Ignoring the visions, Fisk instead chose to focus on his work while also continuing to adhere with his own strict daily routine.

Fisk looks at his own reflection in the mirror
Once he had gotten out of bed, Fisk would then immediately begin his daily routine, starting by making himself the same breakfast which he made every morning, eating it alone while overlooking his view of the New York City skyline. Once he had eaten, Fisk then begins putting on a similar black suit with his father's cufflinks. Often as he would look in the mirror, he would see his reflection as his younger self, covered in his dead father's blood. Starring at this vision in his reflection, Fisk chose to ignore the horrific image and instead shut off the light before leaving his Penthouse to return to his work.

Fisk has a new meeting with Nobu Yoshioka
Arriving at the Pier 81 Warehouse, both Fisk and James Wesley had a private meeting with Nobu Yoshioka, who had become furious that his transportation of Black Sky had been ruined by an encounter with the man in the mask and another man. Yoshioka insulted Fisk's own organization as he felt Fisk had not come through with his promises; Fisk, however, insisted that although the Black Sky was dead, Fisk had, in fact, fulfilled his part of their arrangement by keeping the police away. When Yoshioka suggested that they should renegotiate the terms of their arrangement, Fisk apologized for any offense.

Fisk insists that he will not battle the Hand
Yoshioka instead threatened Fisk before storming out of the pier. Wesley told Fisk that he believed Yoshioka needed to be taught respect as he did not like the way that he had spoken to Fisk. Fearing Yoshioka's influence over the Hand with whom he did not wish to go to war with, Fisk instead told Wesley to leave the situation alone. Wesley argued that the Hand did not contribute enough for their organization in the same criminal way that Leland Owlsley and also Madame Gao did, but Fisk insisted that they were a necessary evil for their organization to continue with their plans.

Assassination of Christian Blake
Fisk on the phone with Vanessa Marianna
While inside his Penthouse, Fisk spoke to Vanessa Marianna about her life as well as his many trips to Asia when he was interrupted by a call from James Wesley. Apologizing to Marianna, Fisk answered Wesley who explained that Christian Blake had just awoken in the hospital after Fisk's sniper shot him. Fisk suggested they use Carl Hoffman to assassinate him as they agreed that Blake would seek revenge, therefore Fisk knew he had to kill Blake before he exposed his entire operation.

Fisk bribing and threatening Carl Hoffman
Fisk had a meeting with Hoffman in which he tried to convince him to kill his friend and partner. Although Hoffman was initially unwilling to betray his friend of 35 years, Fisk was able to change his mind by pointing out Blake's flaws, claiming Blake had been responsible for the masked man gaining information from Vladimir Ranskahov. Fisk began giving subtle threats when Hoffman asked how long it would be until he was also in Fisk's firing line; finally, Fisk allowed Hoffman to choose his own payment for the assassination. Hoffman chose a price and agreed to murder his own close friend for Fisk.

Fisk sits down in Melvin Potter's Workshop
Fisk took Leland Owlsley to Melvin Potter's Workshop to be fitted with a kevlar suit in the wake of his own encounter with the masked man, as Fisk told him that he would keep Owsley safe with an armed guard to ensure it did not happen again. Owlsley stated that if the masked man dropped him off a roof then a lot of money would fall with him; Fisk asked if that was a threat but Owlsley insisted he was just stating the obvious. Once he had finished measuring Owsley for his newest suit, Melvin Potter asked if Fisk needed him for anything else, which Fisk assured him that he did not before defending Potter when Owlsley had rudely accused him of being half an idiot.

Fisk learns of Christian Blake's murder
They were interrupted when James Wesley arrived in the workshop and informed them that while Blake had been successfully assassinated by Hoffman, the incident had now become even more complicated as the man in the mask had gotten into the hospital and got information from Blake before his death. Although Owlsley was mortified by the failure, Wesley assured Fisk that Hoffman had been able to convince the New York City Police Department that the Man in the Mask had assaulted him and then murdered Blake, although Owlsley made it clear he was already losing faith in Fisk.

Madame Gao's Warning
Fisk learning Madame Gao wants to meet
The next day, Fisk was once again awoken in the night by nightmares of his past, causing him to get up and stare long and hard at his new painting. As usual, Fisk began his morning routine by making his own breakfast and putting on his suit, only to be interrupted by James Wesley calling him on the phone. Answering, Fisk was informed that Madame Gao was currently on her way to his Penthouse to discuss recent events, so Fisk requested that Wesley arrive first.

Fisk holds the meeting with Madame Gao
Upon her arrival, Fisk poured her tea which he had bought during his last trip to China while Wesley stood by and translated for them both. Although Gao said she approved of the tea, it was not the reason she was there. She began speaking English and told Fisk that she was aware that he did not need Wesley to translate anymore as Fisk was able to speak Chinese fluently due to all his time in Asia, much to the annoyance of Wesley. Gao questioned if Nobu Yoshioka had guessed that Fisk also spoke Japanese, but Fisk believed Yoshioka had not figured it out, much to the amusement of Gao who claimed that Fisk had been playing the fool to make them underestimate him.

Fisk is given an ultimatum by Madame Gao
Fisk and Gao began speaking to each other in Chinese and asked Wesley to wait outside as there was no need for him any longer. They discussed how neither Yoshioka nor Leland Owlsley were happy with Fisk's handling of the recent events and although Fisk attempted to assure her that things were now under control, Gao did not accept this, thinking back to how Fisk handled the situation involving the deaths of both Anatoly and Vladimir Ranskahov and how that had so negatively affected the organization moving onward, something that Fisk had struggled to defend as a poor emotional decision.

Fisk furiously flips his table over in rage
Gao went on and then called Fisk sloppy and emotional since he had first met Vanessa Marianna, pointing out that she had been able to locate his Penthouse, something he had tried to keep secret, due to his recent lack of preparation. Ignoring Fisk's attempts to defend all of his actions, Gao got to her feet and said if he did not restore his business to order, she would cut him out of their organization and deal with Yoshioka and Owlsley directly. After she left his home, Fisk threw the dining room table over in a furious burst of anger and then aggressively ordered Wesley to immediately leave his home.

Vanessa Marianna's Return
Fisk overlooks New York for several hours
Fisk remained in the same spot in his Penthouse and looked out over the New York City skyline for hours. When James Wesley returned, Fisk ordered him to leave, claiming that if he needed him he would have asked, which Wesley disagreed with. Wesley, however, revealed he had brought Vanessa Marianna with him and left them alone. Fisk, still emotional, asked Marianna to leave; she instead commented on how Wesley was worried about him, but Fisk insisted he should not be, leading to Marianna asking him to tell her the truth.

Fisk explains his past to Vanessa Marianna
Fisk confessed that he was afraid of how Marianna would look at him if he was to tell her the truth about him, but she invited him to speak regardless. Fisk then revealed the story of how he had murdered his own father and he and his mother had covered it up by cutting up his body and dumping it in the river, blaming it on Don Rigoletto. He told her his plans for New York City and how so many people were trying to bring him down and destroy everything he was trying to achieve for the city he loved. Marianna then coldly questioned if Fisk would let them defeat him, but Fisk vowed that he would not.

Coming into the Light
Fisk has breakfast with Vanessa Marianna
Despite the revelation about his past, Vanessa Marianna still spent the night with Fisk in his Penthouse. As usual, Fisk awoke from a nightmare in a cold sweat, but rather than stare at the painting which gave him comfort, Fisk instead moved over to Marianna and embraced her. In the morning Fisk and Marianna enjoyed breakfast together, another change in Fisk's usual morning routine which he happily welcomed.

Due to Marianna's recommendation, Fisk had agreed to hold a press conference for WHiH World News in order to reveal his work to the people of New York City in order to gain support for everything that he was attempting to accomplish for the city. As Fisk went to get his usual black suits to wear, Marianna helped him pick out a new suit, and even made him choose different cufflinks rather than his usual choice of wearing his father's. Marianna continued to help him enter a new stage in his life as he looked at himself in the mirror, approving of the changes which Marianna was now making to his life.

Wilson Fisk makes his first public statement
Fisk then made his public statement to the people of Hell's Kitchen outside the New York State Supreme Court Building with Marianna as well as James Wesley standing close by. Fisk made it clear that he did not usually like speaking in public before he condemned the so-called vigilante justice of the Man in the Mask. Fisk used the recent attack on Leland Owlsley as an example of how this Masked Man was tormenting the good people of New York, calling Owlsley a close friend and a pillar within the financial community who had just been brutally attacked by the Masked Man for seemingly no reason.

Fisk gains the support of the ctiy's people
Fisk told the people that he had attempted to do his work from the shadows in order to not endanger the lives of his friends, claiming the masked man was trying to destroy the work he was doing to save his city, pointing to the Bombing of Hell's Kitchen which was being blamed on the Masked Man. Fisk vowed that he would be stepping out of the shadows, unafraid of those trying to stop him. Fisk asked the people of Hell's Kitchen to stand together before announcing his name to the media. The speech came with support as the viewers cheered for Fisk, believing every word that he had said.

Nobu Yoshioka's Demands
Fisk and Wesley discuss Carl Hoffman
Fisk and James Wesley discussed Fisk's new attention by the media, noting how the new donations were coming in as his approval rating continued to rise. Wesley informed Fisk that Randolph Cherryh wished to have a meeting with Fisk, to which he suggested that they reject whatever restaurant Cherryh suggested first. They discussed the hunt for Carl Hoffman, who since murdering Christian Blake had now suddenly disappeared.

Fisk and Nobu Yoshioka discuss their plans
They were interrupted by the arrival of Nobu Yoshioka, who stormed in and tried to break the hand of Francis, Fisk's own security guard. Although Wesley began translating for Yoshioka, he threatened that if he continued to misquote him, Yoshioka would cut out his tongue. Yoshioka revealed he was furious that Fisk had not delivered the city block that he had been promised; Fisk tried to offer another as the original was proving difficult to clear but Yoshioka insisted on getting the one he and the Hand wanted. Fisk then asked Yoshioka to assist him with finding the man in the mask and then killing him.

Meeting Matt Murdock
Fisk getting introduced to Matt Murdock
Fisk arrived into the Scene Contempo Gallery to meet with Vanessa Marianna, followed closely by his personal security team. Once Fisk arrived there, he was introduced to Matt Murdock who was looking to purchase some art for his apartment. When Fisk was asked his advice on what Murdock should purchase, he had simply told him to buy whatever Marianna recommended for him to buy as the group laughed together.

Fisk tells Murdock his vision for New York
Despite them all sharing the laugh together, Murdock, however, then reminded Fisk that they should not be seen to be talking together as they were both currently on opposing sides of a law case. Fisk then explained to Marianna about how he had just recently bought all of the apartment properties from Armand Tully which was where Elena Cardenas was living, before he had then began to explain his plans on improving New York City but Marianna stopped him, noting that Murdock was a customer of the gallery who was just looking to buy some artworks and was not a donor for his political campaign.

Fisk watches as Matt Murdock goes to leave
While Fisk apologized for talking about his campaign too much, both Fisk and Murdock then expressed their mutual desire to watch Hell's Kitchen reach its fullest potential, claiming this to mean a great deal to him personally. Despite seemingly agreeing with Fisk's statements, Murdock then decided to leave the art gallery, saying that he needed to consider the cost of all these artworks before purchasing them. As Murdock thanked Marianna all of her help, Fisk then watched him as he left the gallery, suspicious if Murdock had another motive in going inside their art gallery, and speaking with Marianna and himself.

Fisk makes a statement on Elena Cardenas
Seeking to speed up all his plans and appease Nobu Yoshioka, Fisk then ordered the assassination of Cardenas, one of the tenants from the building which the Hand desired, as Fisk's men provided Junkie Jake with some Steel Serpent, in exchange for him fatally stabbing Cardenas multiple times, making it appears to be a robbery that had gone wrong, resulting with Cardenas' death. In the wake of this, Fisk was approached by WHiH World News about her death and claimed that he was mourning her murder, and even called it a tragedy, while using Cardenas' death to strengthen his own political standing.

Showdown with Masked Man
Fisk witnesses Nobu Yoshioka's fiery demise
Having baited him with the sudden death of Elena Cardenas, Fisk later arrived inside the warehouse where Nobu Yoshioka had fought the man in the mask until Yoshioka's unexpected fiery death. With the masked man alive but terribly wounded from attacks from Yoshioka's Kyoketsu-Shoge, Fisk confronted him with James Wesley and Francis by his side, thanking him for killing Yoshioka for him and admitted to organizing Cardenas' death to create the trap.

Fisk almost beats the Masked Man to death
The masked man claimed he would kill Fisk, while Fisk was unafraid and dared him to try, resulting in them fighting. Fisk was able to easily overpower the wounded man and beat him mercilessly, taking advantage of the wounds that Yoshioka had already inflicted upon the man with his Kyoketsu-shoge. At one point, the masked man desperately tried to cut him with one of Yoshioka's weapons, but Fisk was saved by Melvin Potter's armored suit, so Fisk responded by chocking the man before slamming his body through a table, finally ending the fight in Fisk's favor as Fisk calmed himself.

Fisk watches the Masked Man escaping
With the masked man lying wounded on the ground and struggling to get back onto his feet, Fisk wiped the blood of his own face while watching the man moan and crawl away. Telling the man that he was disappointed in the poor fight, Fisk then decided to end things once and for all and calmly ordered James Wesley to shoot him, but the masked man was able to disarm Wesley, leaping from a window, and escaped. Fisk told Francis to tell his men to execute the man as soon as they saw him. When Wesley asked what to do about Yoshioka's body, Fisk told him to do nothing and let him burn.

Campaign Gone Wrong
Saviour or Oppressor
Fisk privately meets with Madame Gao
Fisk had yet another meeting with Madame Gao, this time within the open air, looking out over the New York City skyline. Gao commented on the absence of James Wesley, who was now no longer needed to translate as they both spoke to each other in Chinese. Gao told Fisk her metaphorical tale of the snake that died after mistaking an elephant for its prey, explaining that the snake was killed by its own ambitions. Fisk had asked Gao if he was the over-ambitious snake or the unkillable elephant within the metaphor which made her smile.

Fisk and Madame Gao discuss their future
When Gao expressed her disappointment at Nobu Yoshioka's death, Fisk claimed he did not expect Nobu to go against the masked man himself. Gao warned Fisk that the Hand were preparing for retaliation after their Yoshioka's death, and she asked him if his ambition would turn to her, but Fisk assured her that she had his respect so he would not harm her. She told him his mind was distracted by his heart.  She spoke in English to tell him to chose if he was the savior or oppressor of the city, before allowing Fisk to now consider her words and make a decision before someone took advantage of his weaknesses.

Reassuring Leland Owlsley
Fisk prepares to attend his next fundraiser
While preparing for a fundraiser, Fisk spoke to Leland Owlsley and informed him of Nobu Yoshioka's violent death by being burned alive during his fight against the Masked Man, much to the horror and disgust of Owlsley. Ignoring his dismay, Fisk then ordered Owlsley to speak to Madame Gao and assure her that everything was perfectly operational with their organization in the wake of Yoshioka's recent violent death.

Fisk and Leland Owlsley discuss moving on
Owlsley claimed that saying all this would mean lying to Gao's face which Fisk did not deny. Fisk then told James Wesley to bring the car around to then go to the benefit and also prepare to collect Vanessa Marianna. When Owlsley made a comment about Fisk's relationship with Marianna and how things had gotten out of hand ever since he met her, Fisk spoke to him about what it means to be in love with somebody, comparing the love he currently had for Marianna to the love that Owlsley must have at least once had for Lee Owlsley's own mother, which made Owlsley visibly uncomfortable.

Fisk demands Leland Owlsley remain loyal
Owlsley responded by telling him that Gao was right in thinking that Fisk had indeed changed, to which Fisk responded by claiming that change was inevitable for him and for New York City to continue to move forward. Owlsley agreed to speak to Gao in an attempt to keep the organization running. When Fisk thanked Owlsley for supporting him with this matter, Owlsley commented that everyone who was still alive was in this together, making reference to Anatoly and Vladimir Ranskahov's recent murders as well as Yoshioka's. As Owlsley left, Fisk looked out of his Penthouse window at New York.

Poisoning of Vanessa Marianna
Fisk giving a speech at the fundraiser
Fisk attended his fundraiser at the Van Lunt Building and gave his speech to all the attendants in which he noted that he had already been questioned as to why he had come out of the shadows and put forward the question of who would not want to stand up and make New York City a better place to live in, which was greatly supported as they clapped for Fisk. Once he had completed his speech, Fisk began walking through the room greeting some of the people and thanking others for all of their personal donations to his campaign.

Fisk spending time with Vanessa Marianna
Fisk and James Wesley then spoke to Leland Owlsley who assured him that the business with Madame Gao was taken care of which Fisk personally thanked him for. Owlsley then offered them a drink of champagne which Vanessa Marianna gratefully accepted while Fisk instead focused on networking at the event. Fisk was taken away to speak to Randolph Cherryh in private about the zoning plans he had pitched, leaving Marianna alone with Wesley and Owlsley as they went on to discuss Cornelius van Lunt while a bored Marianna sipped at her champagne while Owlsley continued talking.

Fisk watches Vanessa Marianna passing out
While he was speaking to Cherryh, Fisk suddenly noticed that many of the attendants began to collapse after drinking the champagne, including Marianna. Already too late to stop her from drinking the champagne, Fisk ran to Marianna's aid and caught her just as she collapsed into his arms and had even begun foaming at the mouth. Horrified at what he was witnessing, Fisk desperately begged her to stay with him and ordered Wesley to call for an ambulance and take her to Metro-General Hospital in order to save her life while Owlsley quietly dropped his own full glass of the champagne.

Caring for Vanessa
Fisk brings Vanessa Marianna to a hospital
Fisk stormed into Metro-General Hospital carrying Vanessa Marianna in his arms, seeking medical assistance from all the doctors. As the group around Fisk explained what just happened to Murray, James Wesley reassured Fisk that Rosenberg had been contacted and was on his way in a private jet while Fisk looked down at his beloved and silently begged her to make it through this ordeal. As Marianna was being taken into surgery, Fisk demanded to be allowed to stay beside her but was sent away by Schwab.

Fisk waits for Vanessa Marianna's recovery
Fisk waited in silence for news outside the hospital doors, awaiting news on his beloved's condition, while Rosenberg and Murray treated her and tried desperately to save her life. As Fisk sat in the same spot without saying a word and ignored everything around him while awaiting news on Marianna's recovery, Wesley and Leland Owlsley watched over him and discussed Fisk's mental state under times of such incredible emotional stress. As they were speaking, Wesley was informed by Francis that three of the others who had also been poisoned had passed away from the attack.

Fisk and Wesley discuss Vanessa Marianna
Fisk continued to wait in silence until Wesley brought him a cup of coffee, which he refused. They discussed who could be responsible for the attack; Wesley told him that Leland Owlsley believed the Hand was responsible and they noted that Madame Gao could also be involved. Fisk ordered Wesley to bring him the person responsible so he could look into their eyes as he killed them; he then explained he wanted her sent away for her own protection as he felt responsible for her current condition. He then proceeded to awkwardly thank Wesley personally for his help in the matter.

Fisk stays beside Vanessa Marianna's bed
Doctor Rosenberg quietly stepped out of surgery while Fisk was still speaking to Wesley and informed him that Marianna had survived her operation and was currently recovering from her bed, although he did warn Fisk that there may be complications to her recovery after such intense surgery. Fisk shook Rosenberg's hand and thanked him for his work before stepping into Marianna's bedroom to await the end of her sleep so that he would be the first person whom she saw. Fisk sat beside Marianna's bed, ignoring all phone calls and kissed Marianna on the lips as she peacefully slept in her bed.
