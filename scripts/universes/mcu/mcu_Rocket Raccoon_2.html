<html><p>Rocket then used the time for the Ravagers' attention and told them there must be some kind of peaceful resolution to their disagreement, only to backtrack his idea and suggest that he stands away from the conflict. Before any violence had been put into display, Nebula, who was released by Groot, knocked out Udonta by shooting off his Yaka Arrow Controller with a blaster and then shot Rocket, leaving him knocked out from his inevitable imprisonment.

Taserface's Mutiny
Rocket hysterically laughs at Taserface's name
After getting knocked from being shocked by a electrical blaster, Rocket, Groot, and Yondu Udonta were taken to the Eclector where Ravagers who sided with Udonta were being executed. Once Rocket recollect his conscious while being tied up, he witnessed Tullk and Oblo, who were forcefully sent into space and Taserface declares his leadership, much to his laughter.

Rocket happily makes fun of Taserface's name
When Taserface noticed Rocket was laughing out loud at the declaration of the new leadership of their Ravager clan, Rocket questioned Taserface about his name, learning he only chose it because he thought it sounded intimidating; only to be further questioned, resulting on having Taserface's allies started to lose amount laughter and replace it with some confusion. While Taserface tried to torture Udonta, Rocket still snickered at Taserface's name, much to irritation.

Rocket is further threatened by Taserface
Taserface then questioned Rocket on what he was laughing at, to which Rocket responded that he thinks Taserface made up his name in order to sound cool. Further angering Taserface, Rocket guessed Taserface's second choice of his name by calling him scrotum hat, making the entire crew laugh. Now threatened by Taserface, Rocket makes fun of him, calling Taserface a moronic shitbag who thinks his name was cool, before Nebula tells them enough.

Rocket continues to insult Taserface's name
As Nebula insisted to hand the group over to the Kree, who would be wanting retribution for Ronan the Accuser's death, the Ravagers decided to leave Rocket and Udonta inside of a cell where Rocket continued to insult Taserface for his name. Speaking out against Udonta's employees, Rocket sat down had a talk with Udonta, resulting into having them share stories of their past. Rocket listened to Udonta about he was Kree battle slave and Stakar Ogord took him in as part of his Ravager Clan but was too young and greedy that he departed from them.

Rocket talks to Yondu Udonta about escaping
Udonta then informed Rocket of the reason for his exile due to child trafficking, but despite of sharing their feelings, Rocket tells him that they need to find a way to get out of the ship. When Udonta asked of Star-Lord's whereabouts, Rocket noted that Quill was with Ego; before he insulted Udonta's teeth. Rocket then questioned Udonta for why he didn't give Quill to Ego, to which he responded that he was skinny and used him for thieving, leading into an escape plan.

Saving His Friends
Escape from the Eclector
Rocket is approached by a depressed Groot
When Groot walked past the two in the cell after getting beaten and drenched by the remaining Ravagers, Yondu Udonta called him over and instructed him to retrieve his Yaka Arrow Controller, instructing him to find in one of his drawers. Groot, happily excited to escape with his allies, went off to do was he thought Udonta wanted, much to Rocket's doubt.

Rocket tells Groot to find Yondu Udonta's Fin
Groot went to retrieve Udonta's underwear and showed them to the pair. Udonta again told Groot to find his prototype fin but still misunderstood him by bringing in an Orloni. With Udonta asking Rocket to instruct Groot, he attempted to explain where to get the item but Groot brought Vorker's eye, making him laugh at the prospect of leaving out the eye. As they tell Groot where to find the fin, he begins to bring incorrect items, such as a desk and a thumb.

Rocket translates Groot's explanation
When Udonta gave him a Ravagers badge to help him locate the controller, Groot mistook it for Udonta wanting him to wear it as a hat, which Rocket translated to him that Groot was relieved to not where it as hat since he hates hats because he sometimes mistakes that they are part of someone's head, much to his surprise. With Udonta having bring them into focus, they told Groot where to find the prototype fin, only to be brought by Kraglin Obfonteri who felt sorry for Udonta and wanted help him for the murder of his friends.

Rocket attaches the Fin to Yondu Udonta
Once Obfonteri brought the controller to the two and went to go disconnect the third Quadrant, Rocket told Obfonteri to turn on some of Star-Lord's music to alert the other Ravagers. When Obfonteri turned the music on, the two Ravagers were suddenly curious and approached the cell where Rocket was attaching the Yaka Arrow Controller onto Udonta's head. Udonta killed the two Ravagers but as they proceeded to exit the cell, Rocket took the two Ravagers weapons, much to his satisfaction.

Rocket escapes the Eclector with his allies
The three proceeded to get out of the cell through hall of the Eclector where Udonta eliminated all of the Ravagers with his Yaka Arrow before they could react to shooting at their prisoners. When the three make their way to the big station where the Ravagers were alerted, Udonta used his Yaka Arrow to kill the rest of them one by one, as they drop all the way to ground. Groot then attacked Retch and dropped him to the ground. Rocket then met Groot on his shoulder once he killed Retch with no remorse.

Rocket fires at all the attacking Ravagers
They eventually made their way to the control room where Udonta noticed security camera footage of where to find incoming Ravagers and began to kill them one by one. Rocket then began to look up one of camera footage and noticed one of the Ravagers and shot him through the doorway. Having fun with killing the rest of the Ravagers, Rocket shot at the walls with Udonta, as they laugh together at this moment. While Rocket continued firing at the Ravagers, Udonta spotted Taserface and summoned his Yaka Arrow and ignite it at him.

Rocket notices the Eclector being damaged
Once Taserface spotted the Yaka Arrow and dodged it, causing it to hit the ship and blow up some of the surface, Rocket called Udonta a maniac believing that he had doomed their chances of escape, but Udonta told him that Obfonteri will release the Quadrant for their escape. Udonta then led them to the Quadrant which Obfonteri was detaching from the rest of the Eclector. The three then joined Obfonteri in the Quadrant and departed from the Eclector as it blew up.

Rocket sets up a jump point to Ego's planet
As they flew away, unaware of Taserface's short survival and informing the Sovereign of their location, Rocket told Obfonteri that he'll set the Quadrant to make the jump to Ego; however, Udonta told him that shouldn't have done that. Unaware that it required seven hundred jumps, Rocket was told by Udonta that he can't jump into another location for less than fifty jumps at a time, despite of Rocket knowing that.

Confronted by Yondu
Rocket's face disfigures during the jumps
Despite of Yondu Udonta's warnings of going further many jump points for health reasons, the group began to suffer some disfigurements with each orifices of their bodies are starting come apart. Rocket and Groot started to scream loudly as they go to many jump points to reach over to Ego.

Rocket sorely tells Yondu Udonta to shut up
After recovering from their disfigurement, Udonta questioned what was Rocket doing, to which he told Udonta that Ego was bad news and needed to rescue Peter Quill. With Udonta questioning his motives for trying to save Quill, Rocket told him that it wasn't for love and only wanted to save Quill to tell that he is better than him, much to Udonta's laughter at Rocket's true feelings. After Udonta laughed at Rocket's face, he expressed that he knows who Rocket really is.

Rocket is confronted by Yondu Udonta
Rocket then told Udonta that he doesn't know anything about him but Udonta went further into explaining that he knew why Rocket was so defensive toward his feelings. Udonta revealed that he knew who Rocket was knowing that a little bit of love would let him know how empty his heart is. As Rocket kept telling Udonta to shut up, he was told that he was similar to Udonta, resulting into him know their circumstances. Rocket was then informed that they were going to fight a planet, which made him hesitate from not understanding that planet was Ego.

Rescuing Peter Quill
Rocket and Yondu Udonta prepare to attack Ego
Now understanding that Ego is a planet and now has to fight against him to save his allies, Rocket walked over to a Laser Drill with Yondu Udonta, getting ready to battle along with this task. Gamora then contacted Rocket where he was, telling her where he was located and keep themselves closely at bay.

Rocket is finally reunited with the Guardians
Rocket, along with Udonta and Groot, took the Laser Drill and flew down to Ego where they crashed right into his own palace, crushing his human form and saving Peter Quill. Once Rocket's team had finally united inside the Laser Drill, he expressed his sarcastic gratitude when Drax the Destroyer told them they could have been nearly killed them all. Despite of Drax telling Rocket about having the situation under control, Mantis told the group that Ego will return.

Rocket operates the Laser Drill's systems
After learning that Nebula was accompanying them only to hitch a ride off-world, Rocket told everyone how she attempted to murder him, to which she insisted that she saved his life, calling him a fox. Groot, in an attempt to correct her, called Rocket a "raboon," before changing it to the raccoon. The Guardians of the Galaxy proceeded to fly straight towards Ego's core to destroy it before Ego's Expansion could destroy the universe as they know it.

Rocket drills through Ego's surface
As they flew down to Ego's core, Rocket activated the ship's laser system to drill through the surface so they could make their way inside. Rocket then asked if they were saving the galaxy again, thinking they could raise their prices if they're two-time galaxy savers. Quill was annoyed by Rocket's greed, to which he defended was a random thought, claiming to care about the planets and buildings and animals on them; Quill pointed out he left out the people who live on them as well, much to Rocket's indifference.

Destroying Ego
Rocket makes a bomb with Anulax Batteries
When they Guardians arrived at the core of Ego's center, they began to drill into it until Yondu Udonta was contacted by Kraglin Obfonteri about Ayesha's arrival, only to be bombarded by a Sovereign fleet causing them to redirect their fire to the fleet. While the Laser Drill was flying away from the Sovereign, Rocket noticed that the generator was damaged.

Rocket, Star-Lord, and Groot fly to Ego's core
With the generator damaged by the Sovereign, Rocket retrieved a detonator to use for a bomb and tells the team that he can build it with the Anulax Batteries he stole to blow up the core. Once Rocket was done explaining how to plant the bomb and setting the timer for it, he flew out of the ship with Star-Lord and Groot as they move towards the core where they noticed that they couldn't get to the center as it was too small for them. They then realized that only Groot could fit through and plant the bomb, despite of Rocket's belief on being a terrible idea.

Rocket teaches Groot on activating the bomb
Being charge with Groot, Rocket explained to him how to activate the bomb and which button to push. When Rocket tells Groot to repeat what he said, he observed Groot's thinking of pushing the button that instantly blew the bomb up. Rocket then tells Groot what button to press and repeat back what he said, only to get it wrong again. Angry at Groot's learning capabilities, Rocket tells which button is supposed to press but Groot still got it wrong.

Rocket argues with Star-Lord about his task
When Quill came to check on them, Rocket asked him if anybody had any tape so that he could put it over the death button. After Quill asked the team from various locations on if they had any tape, Rocket was then told that nobody had any tape, leading into an argument with Quill about having to do everything making him, unaware of Groot taking the bomb and running off with it, much to his dismay.

Battle on Ego's Planet
Rocket and the Guardians reunite inside Ego
Rocket then joined the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy as they all assembled together after destroying all of the Sovereign fleets. While Drax the Destroyer took Mantis back to the Quadrant after being knocked out, the rest of the Guardians stayed on the planet and fought off Ego's attacks while Groot planted the bomb.

Rocket fights off Ego's attempted attacks
The Guardians were separated leaving Rocket, Star-Lord, and Yondu Udonta to be confronted by Ego, attacking them with his energy tentacles. While the group began to fight against Ego's tentacles, Rocket used a few of his weapons to destroy all of Ego's tentacles including a bunch of mini explosives when he was surrounded and then using a bubble shield to protect himself. Once Rocket detonates Ego's arms, he then equipped himself with a blaster rifle with a satisfying smile, only to be swept up by one of Ego's incoming attacks.

Rocket tells Groot to hurry up on the bomb
Eventually, Ego apprehended all of the Guardians, including Rocket who was trapped under some rubble, before he began firing at the many energy tentacles. With Quill's urged to use his heart to access the powers within him to fight Ego, Rocket and the Guardians was released from Ego's grasp. While Quill fought Ego, Rocket went to retrieve Groot and tell him to get off of the planet before Groot successfully activated the bomb.

Leaving Friends Behind
Rocket saying his goodbyes to Yondu Udonta
As they were about to depart Ego's Planet with just moments left to spare, Rocket noticed Yondu Udonta, who was still on the planet. Rocket flew towards him and told him that he has to get off the planet but Udonta told the to get to the Quadrant, before Rocket told Udonta that they'll not go without him. With someone needing to stay behind and rescue Peter Quill, Udonta told Rocket that he did not believe he had done anything good in his life.

Rocket talks to Groot about his language
Udonta then told Rocket to let him stay, much to Rocket's emotional toll. Rocket gave Udonta an Aero-Rig and a Holographic Space Suit, which he only had one of each. As he was about to leave, Rocket attempted to say something to Udonta until Groot spoke. Rocket translated to Udonta about welcoming him to the team. Rocket and Groot flew off of the planet and onto the Quadrant before he tells Groot to discuss his language.

Rocket prepares to leave Ego's planet
Seeing Rocket return without Quill, Gamora asked where he was, but Rocket was unable to acknowledge being personally affected by Udonta's sacrifice. Gamora then prepared to rescue Quill but was stopped by Rocket who knocked her out with his Laser Cannon as he could not afford to lose another friend. Rocket then ordered Kraglin Obfonteri to leave the planet. Eventually, they found Quill and a deceased Udonta in space and helped them up onboard.

Yondu Udonta's Funeral
Rocket and Groot at Yondu Udonta's funeral
After the Guardians retrieved Quill, they held a funeral for Yondu Udonta who sacrificed himself for him. Quill gave Udonta a eulogy comparing him to David Hasselhoff, saying his peace with Udonta and how he became his pretty cool father all along. As the funeral went silent, Rocket listened to Groot recalling his memory of being called a twig by Udonta, much to his agreement.

Rocket sadly watches the Ravager funeral
When the funeral was over Rocket sent out a message to the other Ravagers, telling them of Udonta's actions and then repaired his Yaka Arrow, which he found broken back on Ego. Rocket then witnessed the Ravagers arrived to give Udonta a funeral. As the Guardians watched the ships salute Udonta in traditional fashion, Rocket realized that Udonta didn't chase them away or stole batteries, which Quill realized he was talking about himself.

Infinity War
Distress Call
Rocket questions the team's decision to help
Several years after they destroyed Ego, Rocket and the Guardians of the Galaxy traveled in space for the insurgency of a distress call sent out by the Asgardians. Rocket asked the team why are they're answering the signal, in which Gamora told him that someone needs saving.

Rocket yells at Groot for his attitude
As Mantis had called the team that they're about to arrive at their signal and Star-Lord told them to be prepare and put on their mean faces, Groot loudly plays Defender on his handheld gaming console, causing a disturbance of the group. After Groot swore at Star-Lord for telling to put away his gaming device, Rocket started to yell at him for being rude and warned if he doesn't put away his console he'll smash into pieces.

Rocket tells the Guardians to get rid of Thor
Upon their arrival, the team noticed that half the Asgardian's ship had been destroyed, leaving the rest of them to die in space. As the team looked around in horror, Rocket commented on the likelihood of any survivors that'll get them paid for their rescue. When Thor suddenly smashed onto their front window of their ship, Rocket loudly complained and called for wipers before realizing that the Asgardian was still alive.

Rocket alongside Mantis stand over Thor
Once the Guardians of the Galaxy took Thor onboard the Benatar, the team tried to figure out how he was still alive, while Drax the Destroyer commented on his looks. Upon having Drax and Rocket talk about Star-Lord's weight, the team discovered that Thor had feelings of anger and tremendous loss. Star-Lord then ordered Mantis to wake Thor up, as he rushed out of the table and heavily took a deep breathe. Rocket and the Guardians quickly prepared for an attack, only for Thor to calmly asked who they are.

Rocket notices Peter Quill's imitation of Thor
Having Thor settled down and eat soup, Gamora told him about Thanos' goal of wiping out half the universe's population with the Infinity Stones. As the tensions rise and came to a close, Thor attempted to take one of the Benatar's Space Pod, only for Star-Lord to tell him to not take their pod, much to Rocket's confusion on Quill's deep voice. As the team keeps commenting on Quill's deep voice as an imitation of Thor, Gamora broke off their attention for Thanos.

Rocket tells Thor he wants to go to Nidavellir
Thor then informed the Guardians about where the Reality Stone is and how Thanos had both the Power Stone and Space Stone to slaughter half his people, further telling them other stones to be on Earth with the Avengers. As Thor tells them they should travel to Nidavellir, Rocket was in disbelief on how the place was real all along, very much liking to go. Thor told the team that Rocket was correct and smartest person, before calling him a rabbit. Rocket was confused by what Thor called him. 

Rocket settles the team to split up into groups
After Thor informed the Guardians that Eitri the dwarf could create a powerful weapons he needs, Rocket was offered to go with him, complementing him on being a noble leader. Rocket happily accepted Thor's offer and prepared to travel to Nidavellir. As Rocket took Star-Lord's backpack, they were stopped by him and asked what kind of weapon Thor was talking, to which he explained that it was one capable of killing Thanos. After a dispute telling them to not have any destructive weaponry, Rocket was more thrilled to be on their quest.

Rocket prepares to travel to Nidavellir
Once Rocket settled their dispute on splitting up into groups, he was told by Star-Lord that he knows he is going to a place where Thanos isn't, much to his mockery of being a captain. Rocket told Groot to travel to Nidavellir with him while Groot was playing his game. As Rocket settle inside the Space Pod, Thor bids the other Guardians a farewell on Knowhere before they departed.

Traveling to Nidavellir
Rocket traveling to Nidavellir in the Space Pod
Making their way to Nidavellir inside the Benatar's Space Pod, Rocket tried to tell Groot where to go to the bathroom in the cup but was nervous to show where he would, leading to Thor tell Groot pour anything out of the cup then go in it again. To Rocket's disbelief, he asked Thor if he spoke Groot, listening to his joke about learning as an elective.

Rocket talks to Thor about the mission
Thor told the group that Nidavellir was the birth place of Mjølnir, and that he intended to make a weapon that is equally powerful. After a short conversation, Rocket turned to see Thor sitting sadly beside the window and started to talk to him about his family members, who are deceased. Rocket asked if Thor was prepared and listened to Thor having rage against Thanos, despite being beaten from his first encounter. Listening to Thor about killing his enemies more than his age number but none had succeeded and is only live by fate, Rocket asked if Thor would be wrong, getting response of loss hope.

Rocket gives Thor a new Prosthetic Eye
Feeling that he could give up something to help Thor on his quest, Rocket gave him a Prosthetic Eye, noting that he got it from a man back in Contraxia. With Thor questioning Rocket about the eye, he told Thor that he got a hundred credits from the bet and then snuck into the man's room to steal his eye. Being thanked by Thor, Rocket then looked at Thor putting the Prosthetic Eye in his socket, telling that he should've washed it first before getting a signal.

Rocket, Thor and Groot arrive at Nidavellir
After getting a signal of the Space Pod, Rocket had observed Nidavellir as a dark metallic star, as he and the group headed over to the station where they settle inside its room. Now inside the room of Nidavellir, Rocket realized that the place was filled with a pile of junk and later discovered a prototype of an Infinity Gauntlet, leading Thor to tell the group to get back to the pod. However, despite the Dwarves being absent, Eitri remained alive and attacked both Rocket and Groot until Eitri was calmed down by Thor.

Rocket and Groot meet Eitri for the first time
As Eitri settled down and explained that he was forced by Thanos to forge the Infinity Gauntlet to harness the power of the Infinity Stones, before being crippled and forced to watch his people executed, Rocket and the group found the Uru mold that can be used to make a King's weapon in which he explained that it could even summon the Bifrost. Together, Rocket, Thor and Eitri worked to repair and restart Nidavellir, in order to forge a powerful weapon called Stormbreaker.

Rocket helps Thor construct Stormbreaker
While inside the Space Pod, Rocket was told by Thor that he needed him to start the engines, much to his doubt. Thor then threw the pod with a string and told Rocket to start the engine, starting the mechanism of Nidavellir's iris. As the iris had finally brightened Nidavellir's mechanisms, Thor told Rocket that is what the star really looked like. Rocket was greatly amazed by it until it was shortly combusted and stopped working, Rocket then drove the pod near the iris and let him open up the gears, leading Eitri to forge the weapon.

Rocket notices Groot forging Stormbreaker
As Thor collapsed from the heat of the star, Rocket rushed to his side and proclaimed that Thor was dying. With Eitri knowing that the axe had no handle, he frantically searched for it so he could revive Thor back to health, calling for Groot to help. Groot saw the opportunity to help Thor and stepped up to use his own wooden arm as a handle to complete Stormbreaker. Once the weapon was completed, Thor used Stormbreaker to travel to Earth with Rocket and Groot.

Battle of Wakanda
Rocket, Groot, and Thor join the battle
As a battle had the Avengers in trouble with the Outriders that were commanded by the Black Order, Rocket and Groot were transported to Earth alongside with Thor into the midst of the battlefield of Wakanda and immediately engaged Thanos' forces.

Rocket shooting at multiple Outriders
During the heat of the fight, Rocket encountered Bucky Barnes while being surrounded by many Outriders. As he fired at many of his enemies while calling them space dogs, Rocket was picked up by Barnes from one of the attacking creatures and was spun in a circle, with both firing their weapons. Rocket perfectly aimed at the many incoming Outriders, shouting at them while firing each round of his blaster rifle.

Rocket asks for the cost of Bucky Barnes' arm
After defeating the Outriders, Rocket was dropped onto the ground, leading to him asking Barnes on the price of his firearm although Barnes replied that it was not for sale. Becoming even more curious, Rocket then proceeded to ask about how much of Barnes' prosthetic arm is worth. Barnes was offended by Rocket's offer and walked off, and Rocket muttered to himself that he would still get that arm.

Thanos' Victory
Rocket witnesses Groot's inevitable death
Once the Mad Titan Thanos had arrived on Earth, he managed to defeat everyone that stood in his way and successfully extracted the Mind Stone from Vision to complete the Infinity Gauntlet. As the Mad Titan basked in his victory, Thor unleashed a devastating attack with Stormbreaker.

Rocket sat down and mourn the loss of Groot
Before Thor could kill Thanos, the latter enacted his plan to kill half the universe with a  snap of his fingers.  With Thanos completed his mission and teleported through a portal, Rocket was forced to watch in horror as Groot disintegrated into dust before his eyes, with Rocket unable to do anything to help his friend. Afterwards, Rocket mourned after Groot along with the other survivors.

Failure
Rocket and Nebula comforting each other
Rocket was among the remaining Avengers who stayed at the New Avengers Facility after the events leading up to the Snap. He was also among those who awaited the arrival of Tony Stark and Nebula after they were rescued from deep space by Captain Marvel. Rocket, in particular, approached Nebula and held her hand in quiet mourning for the loss of their friends in the Guardians of the Galaxy.

Rocket discusses their recent failure
They all then gathered inside where they informed Stark of the Snap's effects on the world. When Stark asked what was wrong with Thor, who was sitting silently alone, Rocket told him that he felt guilty about failing, which was shared by all of them. Rocket's presence shocked Stark as he thought that he was just a Build-A-Bear, although Rocket barely corrected him, not caring about other's calling him other names.

Ambush on Thanos
Rocket reports on a massive power surge
When Nebula revealed she knew where Thanos was, Rocket showed them a planet that had just experienced the same power surge that Earth did when the Snap occurred. The group discussed what they should do, ultimately decided to go after Thanos. They all then boarded the Benatar, with Rocket flying and Captain Marvel co-piloting, and departed Earth.

Rocket and Captain Marvel pilot the Benatar
As they went into space, Rocket asked the Avengers who had never been to space, followed by instructing them not to throw up. They then traveled to the Garden where Captain Marvel left the ship to do recon. When she returned, she informed them that it was only Thanos down there. They then went down to the surface of the planet where Captain Marvel, Bruce Banner, War Machine and Thor ambushed Thanos.

Rocket discovers the Infinity Stones are gone
The others then entered, and Rocket went to collect the Infinity Gauntlet, which Thor had chopped off Thanos' arm. However, when he turned the gauntlet over, Rocket discovered the Infinity Stones were gone, much to everyone's shock. They all then interrogated Thanos, who revealed that he had destroyed the stones. Thor then aggressively sliced Thanos' head off, which Rocket questioned what he had done. The group then returned to Earth, having lost once again.

Member of the Avengers
A New Team
Rocket as a member of the Avengers
With the only family he ever knew gone, Rocket decided to stay with his newly found allies and became a member of the Avengers under Natasha Romanoff's leadership. Rocket would mostly operate with Nebula from the Benatar, reporting back in with the rest of the team from time to time.

Rocket reporting on the ship they boarded
In 2023, Rocket was messaged by Captain Marvel about a highly-suspect warship, so he and Nebula went to check it out as they were closer. However, the ship turned out to be an infectious garbage scow, causing them to smell like garbage. The Avengers then had a meeting, where Rocket reported about the recent mission, which he openly complained to Danvers about. When she said that she wasn't going to be seen for a while, Rocket teased if it was to get another haircut, but she corrected him about the workload she has to cover beyond Earth.

Bringing in Thor
Rocket and Bruce Banner at New Asgard
When the Avengers discovered a way to potentially reverse the Snap, Rocket and Nebula were called in to return to Earth so the whole team was together. When they landed, Rocket asked Scott Lang where Bruce Banner was, as they were tasked with bringing in Thor. 

Rocket searches for Thor in his house
When Banner joined him, they flew to Norway, where they were driven in the back of a pickup truck for the remainder of their journey. When they arrived, Rocket commented how New Asgard was not as nice as a golden palace. Hulk implored Rocket to show some compassion since the Asgardians had lost their home then half their people. 

They then came across Valkyrie, who told them that they shouldn't have come. Rocket then introduced himself to the Asgardian warrior, who exchanged glances with him. Valkyrie told them that Thor would not see them and that he is only seen once a month when he comes in for "supplies." They still went to Thor's house, and when they entered, they discovered that Thor had gained a lot of weight, much to their surprise. Excited to see them, Thor hugged them both, much to Rocket's discomfort. Rocket and Banner were then introduced to former Contest of Champions Korg and Miek, who invited them to use their free wifi and drink their beer. They then watched as they saw their friend yelling at someone through an online video game, which they felt embarrassed by.

Rocket and Bruce Banner try to recruit Thor
They then informed Thor of the chance they had to fix everything, but Thor declined, as he had fallen into a deep state of depression and did not believe he was worth any help to them. However, Rocket was able to convince him by revealing that there was beer on the Benatar. He then went with them and they returned to the New Avengers Facility.

Locating the Infinity Stones
Rocket works on building a Quantum Tunnel
With all the Avengers at the New Avengers Facility, they all began working the means of travel safely through the Quantum Realm. Rocket and Tony Stark worked on a bigger Quantum Tunnel inside the hangar. When Stark called him the wrong name, Rocket corrected him and then reminded him that he was only a genius on Earth. After they did a test run with Clint Barton, they were successful in achieving and harnessing Time Travel.

Rocket explains the Power Stone's history
They then focused on locating the Infinity Stones throughout time, due to them appearing in the past for nearly all of the Avengers. They started with the Aether, which they had Thor explain its history. However, Thor soon started to get off track due to it bringing up past trauma he never got over. The next day, they moved to the Power Stone, Rocket explained to them how Peter Quill stole it from Morag, and then Rocket started to tease Scott Lang due to him getting excited about space.

The Avengers complete their brainstorm
Next, Nebula informed them about the Soul Stone and Vormir, where Thanos murdered her sister to get the stone. By the third day, the Avengers had finalized their brainstorm and planned when and where they would travel to, to get all six stones Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner and Lang going to 2012 to get the Space Stone, Mind Stone and Time Stone, Thor and Rocket to 2013 to get the Reality Stone, and Barton, Natasha Romanoff, Nebula and James Rhodes to 2014 to get the Power Stone and Soul Stone.

Time Heist
Theft of the Reality Stone
Rocket preparing to travel back to 2013
They all then suited up in their new Advanced Tech Suits, and made their way to the Quantum Tunnel. When Captain America gave a motivational speech, Rocket commented on how good he was at that. He then gave Hawkeye a shrunken Benatar for him to travel to Vormir in, which he made him promise to return in good condition.

Rocket and Thor arrive in Asgard in 2013
Rocket and Thor then traveled to 2013, to retrieve the Reality Stone from Asgard, which was infused in Jane Foster. Once they arrived, they followed Foster to her room, and Rocket layer out the plan for Thor to distract her as he extracted the stone from her body using a device they built for the mission. However, Thor started to get distracted, wanting to raid the wine cellar.

Rocket attempts to motivate Thor
They then spotted Thor's mother walk by, which reminded Thor that she died that day. This made Thor become incredibly stressed and start to have a panic attack. Rocket then slapped him to get him focused, reminding him that he has lost people, too, and unlike Frigga, they can get them back, so long as Thor sticks to the mission. They then went to Foster's room, but as Rocket turned around, he discovered Thor had disappeared, so he went in solo.

Rocket extracting the Aether from Jane Foster
Rocket then entered Foster's room, where she was asleep, so he snuck up behind her. When she woke up, Foster got up and Rocket followed her from behind, and then used the device to extract the Aether from her body. This caused his presence to be alerted to the Einherjar, who pursued him through the palace. Rocket rushed through the palace, looking for Thor and trying to lose the soldiers chasing him.

Rocket successfully completes his mission
He soon came across Thor, who was with his mother. Rocket told him they had to go, so Thor hugged his mother goodbye. But, before they left, Thor reached out his hand, to Rocket's confusion, in which Mjølnir came to him, making him happy that he was still worthy, although Rocket was not that interested. They then traveled back to the present, having successfully completed their mission.

Reversing the Snap
Rocket works on creating the Nano Gauntlet
Once they all returned to the present, they noticed Natasha Romanoff was not there, as she had sacrificed herself for the Soul Stone. After they mourned her, Rocket, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner started working on creating a Nano Gauntlet, capable of possessing the Infinity Stones. When they inserted the stones, Rocket made a loud noise to startle the other two, who were tense, much to his delight.

Rocket completes the Nano Gauntlet
When Rocket completed the gauntlet, he then asked who was going to be the one to wield it, which Thor immediately volunteered, but it was Banner who told them all that he had to be the one to do it, due to the levels of Gamma Radiation. They all then suited up as they stood around Banner, preparing for him to snap his fingers. Rocket stood behind Thor for protection against anything that could happen when he put the gauntlet on. Banner then put on the gauntlet, and they watched as it hurt him, but he was able to snap his fingers.

Attack on the New Avengers Facility
Rocket trapped under some rubble
As they checked on Bruce Banner, the facility was suddenly attacked by an air strike, destroying the facility. Rocket, James Rhodes and Banner fell through the floor and became trapped under the rubble. Banner was able to hold up the building, but Rocket found himself trapped and struggling to breathe. Rhodes then made his way to Rocket and tried to lift the rubble off of him.

Rocket and James Rhodes nearly drowning
Rhodes was able to free Rocket, but they were not able to go anywhere. Suddenly, water rushed through, taking them under as it filled up the area. They tried to call out for help but the comms weren't working and couldn't get any responses. As the water rises up to their necks, Rhodes farewelled his ally, believing this to be their final moments, much to Rocket's fear. However, they were saved by Ant-Man, who got them away from the flooded area and to safety.

Battle of Earth
Rocket and War Machine rejoining the battle
Ant-Man then grew to giant size and carried Rocket, War Machine and Hulk out, joining in with the rest of the assembled heroes preparing to face off against Thanos and his army. Rocket jumped on War Machine's back and cocked his gun as Captain America led the epic lineup.

Rocket fighting alongside the Bucky Barnes
They then charged at Thanos' forces, with Rocket riding on War Machine as he flew towards the opposing army, protecting him from the fast paced and chaotic battle. Rocket eventually joined the battle on the ground, picking off incoming enemies side by side again with Bucky Barnes, much like during the Battle of Wakanda. Rocket later reunited with Groot, and the two fought together.

Rocket witnesses Captain Marvel's arrival
When Thanos ordered an airstrike, Rocket attempted to shield Groot from the attack. However, the strike suddenly stopped, and when Rocket looked up, he discovered Captain Marvel arrive at the battlefield. She then destroyed the Sanctuary II, much to Rocket's enjoyment, seeing his ally severely impact Thanos' forces.

Rocket is almost killed by a Leviathan
Rocket eventually found himself facing off against an approaching Leviathan, which was about to eat him, until it suddenly turned to dust. This was because Iron Man obtained the Infinity Stones and used them to snap all of Thanos' forces out of existence. However, this action came at the cost of his life, due to the power of the stones.

Guardians Reassembled
Departing Earth
Rocket attends Tony Stark's funeral
After the Battle of Earth, Rocket, long with the rest of the reunited Guardians of the Galaxy, attended the funeral held for the fallen hero, Tony Stark. Rocket stood alongside the team as they watched Stark being memorialized, by his family. Although only knowing Stark for not that long, Rocket was very upset by his passing, as hated losing more people close to him.

Rocket waits for Thor to board the Benatar
Before the Guardians of the Galaxy departed from Earth, they decided to let Thor join them, as he was now without a path, much like all of them. They waited for Thor on New Asgard to say his goodbyes to Valkyrie, but Rocket hurried him up as he stood outside the Benatar.

Rocket offering Peter Quill and Thor blasters
When Thor boarded the Benatar, he and Peter Quill had a small conflict over leadership, which the others joined in on. When Drax the Destroyer suggested they fight each other for the role of leader, Rocket revealed that he had blasters they could use, unless they wanted knives, much to Mantis' excitement. The conflict was brushed aside, but the position of leader was still left uncertain.

Personality
Due to the inhumane experiments done to him, Rocket became bitterly, even bitingly sarcastic, foul-mouthed and cynical, as well as generally misanthropic, but in recent years seems to have adopted a more calm and temperamental demeanor. He is also easily enraged and extremely aggressive, which, in turn, makes him exceedingly trigger-happy with an innate desire for violence. Despite his toughness, he also possesses a cruel and slightly morbid sense of humor.

Rocket has an obsession with prosthetic limbs, finding it humorous to steal them - especially without the possessor knowing as shown when he asked Peter Quill to get a guy's prosthetic leg to bust them out of jail, lying about the leg to see if Quill would do it and asking him whether the guy was hopping around on one leg, laughing all the while. He later tries pulling a similar stunt with Vorker, one of the Ravagers, saying that he needed the cybernetic eye off for his plan, although he is stopped by Quill. When Groot actually did steal the eye, Rocket burst out laughing into tears. In the Battle of Wakanda, after being assisted by Bucky Barnes in killing a horde of Outriders, he inquired if he can purchase his custom-made machine gun. When he declines the offer, he then offers to purchase Barnes' new vibranium arm, which is also declined. He chuckles to himself as he leaves the offer to buy it on the table.

He appears to pride himself on his abilities and professionalism, which is indicated by when he spoke harshly to Groot when Groot childishly drank out of a fountain then smiled about it. A true criminal, Rocket has a higher sense of self-preservation and interests than the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy. In the conflict against Thanos he volunteered himself and Groot to go with Thor to Nidavellir as opposed to going with his fellow Guardians to confront Thanos directly, and Star-Lord points this out. He will cave into pessimism and panic in a situation that is out of his depth as he was the first to consider simply giving the Infinity Stone to Ronan the Accuser after realizing its destructive purposes and instead of fighting the Accuser after coming into the possession of the Stone, planned to run away to "the furthest corners of the galaxy" with Groot.

Though he displays a somewhat heroic personality, such as defending Xandar from the kamikaze Necrocrafts, Rocket still has a distorted view of the logical and ethical boundaries of the law as he believes if he wants a possession more than the current possessor of such an item, it was acceptable to steal it from him. Rocket was driven by money before he joined the Guardians of the Galaxy and that trait still remains with him, but he has shown himself to be more compassionate and less greedy as time goes on. Although he does not resort to stealing as like he used to and opts for more acceptable methods by noting if they saved the galaxy twice, they could increase the fee for their services.

Rocket is also stunningly intelligent, as he is much more intelligent than a normal raccoon. He is able to conceive very complexly, intricate plans in a very short period of time, such as his plan to escape the Kyln. However, his genius is occasionally superseded by his emotions which appear to be exceedingly strong such as his anger over Quill going back to get Awesome Mix Vol. 1 and his sadness over Groot's apparent demise.

However, deep down, Rocket is incredibly lonely and carries overwhelming pain over the experimentation that was performed on him before he was a Mercenary. He covers his insecurities well, but once he is drunk, he becomes very emotional and if possible, even more violent, speaking of how he did not 'ask' to be made into what he believed was a "little monster," implying that the experiments done to him were torturous. It is perhaps because of this loneliness and pain that he despises being derided as a rodent or vermin, going so far as to attack Gamora and Drax the Destroyer over the slight.

Despite Rocket's apparent dislike of people, he is exceedingly attached to Groot, and is the first known individual who was able to understand Groot when he spoke, even while everyone else only heard 'I am Groot.' He is obviously exceedingly attached to Groot, as seen when he started crying when Groot was apparently killed and pleading with Groot to not save them because he knew that Groot would die if he did so. His grief over Groot's apparent death lead him to angrily charge at Ronan, who was armed with his Cosmi-Rod and the Power Stone, while completely unarmed. It was also in this moment of vulnerability that he was comforted by Drax the Destroyer, which he initially flinched at before accepting the caring gesture, showing that he was not used to such gentleness or kindness. He also became very protective of Groot’s offspring, caring for him in a fatherly manner and collapsed to his knees sobbing when he was erased from existence by the Infinity Gauntlet.

As he got to know his fellow Guardians better, he became much more protective of them. An example of this was when he, Groot and Yondu Udonta escaped the Eclector and were going to save Quill. He initially insisted that he wanted to save Quill strictly because he wanted to prove that he was "better than him." Udonta managed to break through to the core of what Rocket is truly like on the inside, saying that they are the same type of person in the sense that, while they genuinely care about the people around them, they refuse to show it out of fear and insecurity.

Quill's taste in music seems to have rubbed off on Rocket as he seems to enjoy listening to songs from Star-Lord's era, especially while working such as making sure the Guardians had music to listen to whilst battling the Abilisk, when the Ravagers attacked him on Berhert and escaping the Ravagers with Udonta, the former even Quill found to be distracting.

While captive with Yondu Udonta, Rocket quickly bonded with him due to their similar backgrounds and the fact that they love people without saying it. A great example of his newfound bond with Yondu is when he refused to leave Ego's Planet without him, even though it would mean his death since the planet was about to explode. His bond with Yondu also caused him to call the rest of the Ravagers during Udonta's funeral. While watching his funeral, Rocket stated the his previous team never abandoned him even if "he yelled at them, and was always mean, and he stole batteries he didn't need" clearly comparing himself to Udonta.

Four years after the Battle on Ego's Planet, Rocket has become slightly more empathetic, showing a growing level of maturity, as seen when he consoled Thor over his multiple losses and became concerned for him after he nearly died activating the damaged neutron star, though he still has his money-driven personality, as seen when he stated they could ask for financial compensation when traveling to respond the Statesman distress call.

After the events of the Snap, Rocket has grown more affectionate to those he considers family, sitting beside Nebula and holding her hand upon reuniting. He has also grown wiser and more selfless, trying to console Thor after everything he has been through but also reminding him of their duty to the people they could still save.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Rocket's cybernetic enhancements
Artificially Enhanced Physiology: Rocket, as a Halfworlder, is a cybernetically engineered creature. His enhancements include a cybernetic skeletal structure, enhanced phalange, and metacarpal bones, and a genetically augmented cerebral cortex. He can walk and talk like a humanoid creature while remaining (what appears to be) a raccoon.

Enhanced Intelligence: Rocket's cerebral cortex was genetically enhanced meaning that unlike other members of his species he has a cognitive and intellectual equivalent or superior ability to the most sensitive species in the galaxy. He can talk and communicate with other species, as well as perform extremely complex tasks. Even though he has only known him for a short time, Thor claimed that Rocket is the most intelligent member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Rocket has an affinity for using and forging galactic artillery, piloting spacecrafts, and quickly devising strategies.
Enhanced Strength: Due to his augmentations, Rocket is able to use weapons that are designed to be wielded by normal sized humanoids with ease. He was also able to swiftly tackle Gamora to the ground when she attempted to assassinate Star-Lord to get the Orb and easily stun many human-sized Ravagers using his strength.
Enhanced Durability: Due to his cybernetic implants, such as a cybernetic skeletal structure, Rocket is capable of surviving damage that would normally be sufficient to kill an animal of his size, as well as injure a normal sized human. He has been attacked with enough force to knock him back several meters and only suffered minimal injury, as well as withstood being thrown by Gamora and blasted by the Cosmi-Rod. Even more impressively, he survived being pinned under an enormous amount of debris when Thanos attacked the Avengers' headquarters, albeit he had trouble breathing.
Enhanced Agility: Rocket's entire skeletal structure is cybernetic, allowing him to move more like a human and still be as agile as a raccoon. He narrowly avoided rapid gunfire during the Escape from the Kyln and escaped the Einherjar after extracting the Aether from Jane Foster.
Enhanced Reflexes: Rocket is able to quickly respond to high-intensity situations, such as piloting the Milano through a Quantum Asteroid Field.</p></html>
