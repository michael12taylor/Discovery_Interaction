<html><p>Superhuman Durability: Cage has extremely durable skin, and his bulletproof resilience is enough to withstand using his strength to easily break stone and metal without injury. He is impervious to nearly most forms of physical harm, injury or pain. He has nigh-indestructible and impenetrable anatomy, with a tensile strength greater than 2 gigapascals. The durability of his cells can be likened to those found on abalone shells, due to their structure and superelasticity. Cage demonstrates this durability to Jessica Jones by using a circular saw against his own stomach, and he survived both being stabbed in the neck and being shot with a shotgun, neither of which could break his skin. A doctor's drill began to smoke when drilling against his skin. Cage's skin is also fire resistant, as demonstrated by his being able to withstand a point-blank explosion in his bar and not feel a thing when he emerged while on fire. He was also able to withstand a point-blank explosion from an M67 grenade in both of his hands, remaining unharmed. Shots from handguns and machine guns at point-blank range caused Luke minor discomfort at times, which only managed to anger him while in combat. However, he has managed to tolerate the bullets as of late. Luke has been shot point-blank with multiple high-caliber machine guns, with the bullets simply ricocheting off of his skin. He even had an entire building fall on top of him, fell from a height of over 30 feet and cracked the ground upon landing and had a car crash right into him, all of which left him unscathed. Having been shot at countless times, Luke has learned how to take advantage of the ricocheting bullets off his skin as a means of offense, to hit people with their own bullet. The only known thing that was able to pierce Cage's skin is the Judas Bullet, and though the bullet would have exploded a normal human, Cage managed to barely survive two of them. However, due to a second treatment, Judas Bullets can no longer penetrate Cage's skin. Also, Claire Temple was able to stick a needle behind his eye, along his optic nerve and into his cranium to drain out cerebral spinal fluid in his head, meaning the tissues deeper into his skin can be more vulnerable. She and Noah Burstein also stuck a syringe down Luke's throat to puncture his mucous membrane and get a blood sample for testing. In addition, individuals with superhuman strength, such as Diamondback (with powered armor) Bushmaster, and Danny Rand can injure him. However, he is still susceptible to drowning, starvation, suffocation, and dehydration.
Enhanced Speed: Cage can run at speeds exceeding that of the finest human athlete. He was able to complete the 40-yard dash in 3.72 seconds (21.51 mph), which is faster than Usain Bolt's record (4.22 seconds/18.96 mph) and Jessica Jones' mile time of under four minutes (over 15 mph). He was also shown capable of running fast enough to intercept a speeding vehicle to save Claire and Scarfe. Todd Bowles referred to Cage's performance as one of the best workouts he had ever seen, with Chase Brunski describing Cage's speed as "world-class," which made him a great candidate for playing football, as he "could blow through an offensive line like a pile of leaves."
Superhuman Stamina: Cage was able to swim from Seagate Prison to shore without stopping, a task deemed impossible for any man. Cage was also able to attack multiple safe houses and engage in multiple fights in the span of a few hours, without showing any signs of tiredness. However, strenuous activity and extended use of his powers do seem to cause Luke to be hungry, as he is seen eating large amounts of food afterward. His stamina allows him to easily outlast his opponents, especially when they are in great number, meaning that even if they manage to overpower him, he could still manage to get the upper hand.
Regenerative Healing Factor: The original procedure Cage went under was designed to accelerate tissue regrowth in its subjects; as a result, Cage's body heals at an accelerated rate. During the experiment, all of the injuries and physical damages that he had were healed to perfect condition, leaving his body without scars, within moments. Cage also healed from two gunshot wounds inflicted by the Judas Bullet without retaining scars in a matter of hours, though he needed the shrapnel from the bullets removed beforehand. In a few hours, he completely recovered from brain hemorrhage and cerebral edema, caused by a shotgun blast against his chin that Jessica Jones used to knock him out, while Claire Temple had to drain cerebrospinal fluid from his eye while he had a seizure and noted that moving him could kill him to Jessica Jones. Although he needed the help of Tilda Johnson, Cage was able to heal his internal injuries after getting knocked down by Bushmaster, a man of great superhuman strength and fighting ability.
Abilities
Gifted Intellect: Cage is a highly intelligent individual. He is cultured, well-read, familiar with legal and civil rights, as well as a skilled public speaker.
Expert Investigator: Due to his time as a police officer, Cage has expert detective skills. He was able to track down Chico Diaz in four hours, a task neither the NYPD or Stokes Crime Family could accomplish. While trying to undermine Cottonmouth's operations, he began taking jobs from the people who Cornell had brought trouble for. Many of these jobs included having to track down missing items.
Cage fighting against a Seagate prisoner
Expert Combatant: Due to training with Willis Stryker in boxing at a very young age, receiving combat training in the military and the police force, and further honing his skills in an underground fighting ring at Seagate Penitentiary, Luke Cage became a highly skilled combatant, able to easily get the upper hand on unarmed opponents. This allowed him to defeat Comanche and Shades when they attacked him in his sleep, though they were not trying to kill him and were unarmed. When forced to fight for Albert Rackham, he defeated several skilled and athletic fighters and was one of the best fighters in Rackham's secret fights. He has training in hand-to-hand combat, bare-knuckle boxing, boxing and street fighting. Since the experiment that physically enhanced him, Cage resorts to using his strength while fighting, but he is nevertheless a skilled combatant, using brawling and street fighting techniques, especially when he does not want to injure his opponents. He can render people unconscious with simple slaps, throw his opponents, and has demonstrated using joint locks on people he does not want to hurt. His skills have also allowed him to defeat trained fighters such as Sowande and Bushmaster, two highly trained martial artists in their own rights.
Facilities
Mount Olivet Baptist Church: Growing up in Georgia, Lucas was raised by his father, James Lucas in their church, where Lucas was often referred to as the miracle child due to his unexpected birth, which he always resented. Here Lucas also met and became close friends with Willis Stryker who Lucas' father had also seemed to dislike.
Luke Cage working at his bar
Luke's: With the help of Connors, Cage got himself a bar named after himself which he continued to run following Connors' death, hiring Roy Healy as a bartender and flirting with many of the customers which also included Gina who he had sex with upstairs. Here Cage had first met Jessica Jones who he started a relationship with. However, when Cage was put under the control of Kilgrave, he was forced to blow up the bar with himself still inside, right in front of Jones' horrified eyes.
Luke Cage's Apartment: Located directly above the bar where he had worked, Cage's own apartment is where he had brought Gina and Jessica Jones to have sex with. Cage also kept his photograph of Reva Connors in his bathroom there, still in mourning over her sudden death.
Alias Investigations Office: To be added
Cage at the Barbershop
Pop's Barber Shop: Upon moving to Harlem, Cage was hired by his friend Pop to work for him, cleaning up hair and polishing the windows, however, when Pop was killed by Tone, Cage and Bobby Fish worked together to ensure that the Barber Shop was kept open in honor of their friend. As Cage's notoriety as a hero grew, the Barber Shop soon became both a positive and negative target, as Diamondback attacked it while Dave Griffith used Cage's fame to sell t-shirts. During his breakup with Claire Temple, Cage was then forced to briefly move onto the sofa at the Barber Shop as he was kicked out of her own apartment. When Cage was given ownership of Harlem's Paradise by the late Mariah Dillard, Griffith then requested that the ownership of the Barber Shop be handed over to him instead, which Cage accepted.
Genghis Connie's: During his move to Harlem, Cage rented a room from Connie Lin, although he often struggled to pay the rent despite working two jobs. When Cottonmouth attempted to assassinate Cage by shooting the building with a rocket launcher, Cage protected Lin and pulled her out of the rubble.
Soledad Temple's Apartment: As Cage and Claire Temple began their relationship, he had moved into the apartment which was owned by Temple's mother. However, during a fierce argument, Cage punched a hole in the wall which caused Temple to break up with him.
Harlem's Paradise: Cage initially worked at the club as a dishwasher under the close watch of Nate, but Cage quit the job upon falling into conflict with its owner Cottonmouth. During his continuing conflict with Cottonmouth, Cage would often return back to the club to threaten his former employee, before then learning that Diamondback had taken over following Cottonmouth's murder, resulting in a hostage situation as Cage attempted to save innocent lives from his half brother. When Mariah Dillard took over the club, Cage continued visiting to offer her warnings, while also saving her from Bushmaster's attacks. Following Dillard's death, however, she revealed that she had left Harlem's Paradise to Cage in her will, which Cage accepted so he could watch over the crime in Harlem.
Prisons
Cage being taken out of Seagate Penitentiary
Seagate Penitentiary: When Lucas was accused of a crime he did not commit, he was sent to Seagate under the watchful eye of Albert Rackham, who often abused Lucas. Here, Lucas was beaten by Shades and Comanche before he was blackmailed into participating with illegal fight clubs for Rackham's profits. When Lucas chose to betray Rackham and expose his crimes, Lucas had tried to go to Reva Connors for aid but he was first attacked by Shades and Comanche. Slowly dying from all his injuries, Lucas was treated by Noah Burstein who experienced on Lucas, giving him enhanced strength and unbreakable skin, allowing Lucas to break free and go on the run with the assistance of Connors, renaming himself Luke Cage. Upon revealing his identity, Cage was arrested by United States Marshals Service and brought back into the Seagate because of his previous unlawful escape. Later, lawyer Foggy Nelson helped free Cage.

Luke Cage is XXL and 6'3."
Behind the Scenes
Quentin Tarantino was once set to direct a film based on Luke Cage after the release of Reservoir Dogs. Tarantino wanted Laurence Fishburne for the role, but abandoned the film due to studio insistence that Wesley Snipes be chosen instead.
Idris Elba expressed interest in portraying Luke Cage before Mike Colter was cast.
Eric Thomas Wilson, who portrayed HYDRA Guard in the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episode Bouncing Back, campaigned to portray Luke Cage in 2011 with a video pitch.
Cage wearing a hoodie in his own television series was intended by showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker as a tribute to Trayvon Martin, emphasizing "the idea that a black man in a hoodie isn't necessarily a threat."
Guy Fernandez and Haaron Hines were stunt doubles for Mike Colter in the role of Luke Cage.
Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely considered having Luke Cage and Daredevil appear in Avengers: Infinity War. Cage was later considered by them to appear during the Battle of Earth sequence in Avengers: Endgame, too, but his inclusion was dropped again to not make it a "character orgy."
