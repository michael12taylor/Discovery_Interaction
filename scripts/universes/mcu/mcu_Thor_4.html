<html><p>While Thor and Korg discussed how Sakaar was a place that did not make sense, Thor then questioned if anybody had ever fought Grandmaster's ultimate champion, to which Korg pointed out that only Doug had, and Doug was dead. Korg then questioned if Thor intended to fight Grandmaster's champion, to which he insisted he would and he would win, as Korg noted that Doug used to say the same thing before being killed, calling Thor the new Doug.

Thor prays for Odin's journey towards Valhalla
While still locked within the cell, Thor sat alone a prayed for Odin to have a safe journey to Valhalla. During his prayers, Thor was visited by Loki, who had commented that he understood how much it hurt to discover that your own family had been lying to you your entire life, ever since Loki discovered he was actually a Frost Giant. Thor's only response to seeing Loki was to throw stones at him, unsurprised to discover that Loki had sent down another projection of himself.

Thor is visited inside his prison cell by Loki
Loki suggested to Thor that they win Grandmaster's trust until they killed him and ruled over Sakaar together, although Thor clearly did not approve. Seeing that Thor had other plans, Loki reminded him of how Hela had destroyed Mjølnir with ease and proved herself to be vastly more powerful than both of them, only for Thor to accuse Loki of killing their father and allowing Hela to take power. Loki then left, with Korg and Miek telling him to piss off once he left.

Fight Preparation
Thor and Korg choosing weapons for battles
While Thor was preparing himself to fight ultimate champion of Grandmaster, he set about choosing his weapons to take into the battle. Korg offered to help pick a weapon, as Thor told him about Mjølnir, although Korg misunderstood how it had allowed Thor to fly. Korg summarized that Thor had a special relationship with Mjølnir and that its destruction was similar to losing a loved one.

Thor attempting to speak with Valkyrie
Still struggling to pick a weapon, as he attempted to throw a hammer and was disappointed when it did not return to his hand, Thor then spotted the drunk woman who had captured him. Speaking to Korg about her, Korg revealed that she was actually Asgardian, much to Thor's great surprise. Thor then attempted to speak to her, as she threatened to reactivated his Obedience Disk, which had just made Thor considerably more nervous about speaking with her.

Thor is forcibly dragged away before his battle
While she attempted to ignore him, Thor discovered that the woman was actually a member of the Valkyries. While Thor gushed about his admiration of the Valkyrie and how he had always wanted to join them before learning they were only women, Thor had then informed Valkyrie of the threat of Hela to Asgard and had requested her help in stopping her. When she was unsympathetic to the plight of Asgard, he called her a coward before being forced to go out and fight.

Thor's hair is forcibly cut off before his battle
Having once again been incapacitated from the Obedience Disks, Thor underwent final preparations for his final battle against the champion. Moments before going out to fight the champion, Thor then had his hair cut by someone strangely familiar, who ignored Thor's desperate pleas for his beloved hair not to be cut off. Thor was then given Doug's mace and shield, a pair of retractable swords as well as a collapsible helmet for his battle the champion.

Duel with Hulk
Thor stepping into the arena for his battle
Stepping inside the Contest of Champions' arena, Thor had prepared himself to fight in order to return to Asgard. While the audience continued cheering, Grandmaster introduced Thor as the Lord of Thunder while his champion prepared to arrive. Thor put on his helmet and got ready for his fight, armed with Doug's Mace and Shield as his weapons against the champion.

Thor realizes that Hulk is his opponent
However, to Thor's complete surprise, when the champion emerged, it was revealed to be Hulk. Thor became completely overjoyed at seeing his former Avengers teammate, calling out to both Loki and Grandmaster as he called Hulk a friend from work. Thor had then attempted to talk with Hulk, explaining Mjølnir's destruction and Loki being alive and tried to negotiate with Hulk, but Thor made the mistake of calling him Bruce Banner which angered Hulk.

Thor is forced to battle against Hulk
To Thor's great surprise, Hulk insisted that there was no Banner but only Hulk and furiously attacked Thor. He then quickly defended himself and the two fought inside the arena, with Hulk smashing Thor with his Sakaaran War Hammer, sending Thor flying backwards as he lost his Mace. Annoyed at being attacked, Thor drew his swords and attempted to get through to Banner, insisting that they were friends, but Hulk refused to listen to him and attacked.

Thor is smashed through the wall by Hulk
Hulk soon managed to gain the upper hand in their clash as he broke Thor's swords and kicked him across the arena, smashing Thor into a wall, much to the delight of Grandmaster. Thor was just able to free himself as Hulk then launched one of his massive hammers towards him, before charging towards Thor armed with his axe. Thor, however, responded by ripping the hammer from the wall and striking Hulk with it at full force, sending him flying back.

Thor attempting to calm down Hulk
While everybody in the arena watching the fight froze in shock at the blow, including Korg and Miek, Thor calmly made his way towards the now injured and surprised Hulk. Seeking to end the fight without any more conflict, Thor then tried to use Black Widow's calming technique which Romanoff had often used during their time in the Avengers, in a final attempt to turn Hulk back into Bruce Banner and end their fight before anybody could be seriously hurt.

Thor is smashed into the ground by Hulk
Despite Thor insisting that he would not hurt Hulk anymore, the plan had failed to work, and Hulk smashed Thor into the arena's ground repeatedly, before launching Thor across the arena, much to Loki's considerable joy since Hulk attacked him similarly during the Battle of New York. While Hulk celebrated and enjoyed the cheers from the crowds of Sakaarans who were supporting him, Thor got back to his feet and prepared to keep fighting.

Thor gaining upper hand against Hulk
Annoyed all his attempts were having no effect, Thor decided he had had enough and, armed with the Sakaaran War Hammer, proceeded to fight back against Hulk, with his Asgardian strength combined with his long history of fighting, allowed him to gain the upper hand over Hulk's pure rage. As they continued fighting, Thor managed to destroy Hulk's Sakaaran Battle Axe and attempted to beat him down until he could force Hulk to transform back in Banner.

Thor becomes overpowered by Hulk
While Thor expressed his embarrassment that Hulk was fighting him even after Thor claimed they were friends, they briefly engaged in some hand to hand combat, with Thor still proving himself to be the superior fighter as he put Hulk into a headlock. However, as Thor regained the War Hammer and attempted to launch another attack, Hulk grabbed the hammer before Thor could strike him with it. Thor was caught off-guard as Hulk punched him clear across the arena.

Thor's body surges with his powerful lightning
While Thor was lying on his back, Hulk proceeded to leap on top of him and began to beat him into submission, much to the delight of everybody watching, including Grandmaster. As Thor's protection, his helmet, was knocked off, he was almost beaten to death but was given a vision of Odin, which allowed Thor to tap into a previously unknown source of power as his entire body surged with lightning. As Hulk paused, unsure of what to make of this, Thor struck him with a lightning-charged punch, knocking the brute flat on his back.

Thor battles against Hulk
The powerful strike damaged Hulk's Sakaaran Battle Armor and gave Thor the support of the Sakaarans who began chanting Thor's name. Charged up with his new found powers, Thor ran towards Hulk, who was furious that he was losing the support of the people. As both combatants simultaneously launched at one another, Thor delivered another blow, more powerful than the last, creating a visible shockwave and flooring Hulk.

Thor being incapacitated by Grandmaster
As the fight had finally begun to reach its conclusion, Thor was still winning against Hulk, to the shock of Korg and all the gladiators of the Contest of Champions as well as the spectators, while Valkyrie watched from Warsong. However, Grandmaster, unwilling to see Hulk lose since he was a fan favorite, cheated and "fixed" the fight by activating his Obedience Disk. As Thor lay defenseless, Hulk took advantage and then landed the final blow against Thor.

Trapped on Sakaar
Thor wakes up inside Hulk's luxurious room
In the wake of the Duel in the Grand Arena, the bruised Thor had eventually awoken inside some luxurious quarters with a team of nurses tending to his injuries. Getting to his feet, Thor put his Asgardian armor back on before exploring the room, discovering that Hulk was also there, and was taking a bath at that moment, as Thor first confirmed that Hulk would not attempt to attack him again.

Thor begins asking Hulk about Sakaar
Thor began questioning Hulk about exactly how he had managed to get into Sakaar, becoming frustrated as Hulk struggled to answer his questions. When Hulk claimed he had gotten where he was by winning at the Contest of Champions, Thor insisted that he had won by cheating since Grandmaster had activated his Obedience Disk. Hulk finally revealed that he arrived in the Quinjet, then showing where it was in a scrapyard, walking by Thor while naked.

Thor tries to convince Hulk to come to Asgard
Reclaiming his possessions, Thor asked Hulk to come to Asgard with him and ensure that Hela did not cause Ragnarök. However, Hulk refused to leave Sakaar and return to the Earth, explaining that he still believed he was utterly hated back on the Earth ever since the events of the Duel of Johannesburg where Hulk had inadvertently endangered the lives of innocent people and therefore, he would not leave Sakaar where he was adored by thousands of his fans.

Thor learns he cannot leave Hulk's room
Although Thor attempted to convince Hulk that everybody loved him since he was a member of the Avengers, Hulk insisted that Thor was only friends with Bruce Banner, which Thor denied by claiming that he did not even like Banner. Hulk, however, had still refused to go with Thor to Asgard to confront Hela, as the annoyed Thor made his way out while insulting the room. However, Thor discovered the door was electrified and he was unable to leave without being shocked.

Communicating with Heimdall
Thor communicates with Heimdall
Trapped in their room, Thor watched while Hulk had put back on his Sakaaran Battle Armor and went training with Valkyrie for his next fight with the Contest of Champions. Once he was alone, Thor had meditated and attempted to come into contact with Heimdall back on Asgard in order to learn what was happening while he was still trapped on Sakaar and unable to return home to aid Heimdall.

Thor and Heimdall speaking to each other
Managing to get through to Heimdall, Thor was immediately shown that Asgard was currently in an utterly dire situation as Heimdall was being forced to evacuate the Asgardians before Hela to imprison or execute them, having already slaughtered the Warriors Three while Thor had been gone. Thor expressed his desire to return to Asgard and stop Hela and keep the people safe, confessing that he did not actually know where he was currently was within the universe.

Thor asks Heimdall how to return to Asgard
As Heimdall explained Hela was planning to use her newly regained power to consume all the Nine Realms, he then suggested that Thor could possibly be able to get out of Sakaar by going through many of the wormholes that littered the sky. As Heimdall drew Hofund due to being attacked by Hela's Berserkers, Thor questioned which one of the wormholes to use to escape and Heimdall suggested that he use the biggest one before their communication had then ended.

Catching up with Hulk
Thor attempts to rip out his Obedience Disk
Still determined to get out of Sakaar and return to Asgard in order to help his people in their battle against Hela, Thor attempted to rip out of his Obedience Disk out of his neck once again to which he had no luck as it had instead caused him considerable pain. Seeing this, Hulk noted how sad Thor looked, to which Thor simply told him to shut up as he sat alone and contemplating his next move.

Thor and Hulk have a furious argument
While Hulk pushed him over and still continued teasing him, the annoyed Thor rebutted that he was furious to what had happened to his home, the death of Odin and the destruction of Mjølnir before he had become imprisoned by Grandmaster. When Hulk had appeared to ignore all of Thor's complaints, Thor accused him of not listening and began kicking some stuff towards Hulk and accusing him of currently being a really bad friend.

Thor accusing Hulk of almost killing him
As their childish argument continued, Hulk told Thor to stop kicking stuff, to which Thor responded by claiming that Hulk was known as the stupid member of the Avengers, as Hulk called Thor the tiny Avenger. As his temper rose, Hulk threw a shield at Thor which nearly decapitated him, resulting in Thor angrily claiming that everybody on the Earth did hate Hulk, which Thor soon realized had greatly upset Hulk who sat down on his bed and sulked.

Thor calmly catches back up with Hulk
Seeing that he had genuinely upset him, Thor decided to apologize and Hulk accepted, noting that nobody actually called Hulk the stupid Avenger. As they sat together, Thor claimed they were very alike, with Hulk comparing himself to raging fire and Thor to either water or a smoldering fire. Once he got Hulk to calm down, Thor told him to do something of his favor, asking him to bring Valkyrie to his room so he could convince her to help him to escape.

Tricking Valkyrie
Thor tricking Valkyrie into meeting with him
The next day, Hulk did as Thor requested and had Valkyrie come up to his room, as together they playfully sparring with each other as Hulk played with the Sakaaran War Hammer while Valkyrie kicked him over. Thor then revealed himself in the room, awkwardly trying to look impressive before Valkyrie simply ignored him and prepared to leave the room, as she claimed that Thor was too thick headed to see she was in Sakaar only to hide away from her problems.

Thor attempts to recruit Valkyrie's assistance
As Hulk threw part of his bed to ensure she did not leave, Valkyrie agreed to listen for as long as it took her to drink a large bottle of alcohol. Thor began explaining how Asgard was currently in danger and he needed her help to return there. However, he soon discovered that Valkyrie was a faster drinker than he expected as he soon was out of time. Thor then explained that Odin was dead and Hela had invaded Asgard, which caused Valkyrie to stop in her tracks.

Thor explains everything about Hela's return
Thor had then insisted that he currently planned on stopping Hela by putting together a team which he wanted both Hulk and Valkyrie to be a part of, although both refused to help him. When Thor tried to reach her by calling out the legend of the Valkyries, she explained to him how she had witnessed Odin lose control of Hela, resulting in the horrifying Massacre of the Valkyrie in Hel, which is what had led her to not wanting anything more to do with Asgard and Odin's family.

Thor manages to successfully deceive Valkyrie
Valkyrie explained the problem with the Asgardian Royal Family while Thor tried to explain that he agreed with her, while Valkyrie held her knives to his throat as a warning to not get too familiar with her. Thor told her that these issues were the reasons he had turned down the throne, noting that this was not about the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf or even the two of them, but the Asgardians themselves who were in danger, but still, Valkyrie refused to be involved in the fight against Hela.

Thor beginning his own escape from Sakaar
Thor, however, revealed that he had gotten closer to Valkyrie simply to steal the control to his Obedience Disk, allowing himself to finally be free of Grandmaster's control. With that, Thor took a ball while Hulk had been playing with and used it to crack the room's glass window, although this resulted with the ball bouncing back and striking Thor directly into the face. Jumping back up as if nothing happened, Thor said this was what heroes did before leaping out of the window.

Saving Asgard
Escaping Grandmaster
Thor attempts to unlock the Quinjet's access
Thor attempted to get back to the Quinjet that brought Hulk into Sakaar in the first place, avoiding the Sakaarans as he made his way towards it. Activating the Quinjet, Thor had announced himself by his name, but this was rejected. Having tried several other names including the God of Thunder and the Strongest Avenger, Thor finally cursed Tony Stark as he used the codename Point Break which Stark had previously given him, and was given clearance.

Thor watches Hulk destroying the Quinjet
However, before Thor could take off and escape from Sakaar, Hulk suddenly appeared and pushed his way onboard, destroying almost everything in his path while he demanded that Thor stay on Sakaar with the Contest of Champions. It was only when Thor accidentally activated a recording of Black Widow's attempts to get Hulk to turn the Quinjet around following the Battle of Sokovia that Hulk pacified and transformed into Bruce Banner, despite some resistance.

Thor attempting to calm Bruce Banner down
Thor approached Banner who was confused by his surroundings, as he questioned what had happened about Ultron. Eventually, Thor had realized that Banner had been in Hulk form since Sokovia and, as a result, Hulk had completely taken over. Because of this, Banner was powerless and does not remember anything that has happened for the past two years since, questioning what happened with Ultron, where he currently was and what had happened to Thor's hair.

Thor and Banner see Grandmaster's warning
While Thor tried to explain everything, Banner checked the Quinjet's records and saw footage of Hulk being sucked through a wormhole. Grandmaster then appeared in a massive projection above the city, explaining that his beloved champion had been kidnapped by Thor and ordering the Sakaarans to find them. Thor told Banner that he had been there for some time, noting that he was champion and they had just had a battle which Thor had claimed to have won before they then made their escape.

Helping Bruce Banner
Thor attempts to accompany Bruce Banner
Thor and a highly nervous Bruce Banner made their way through the streets of Sakaar, as Thor attempted to keep his friend calm by repeating Natasha Romanoff's calming words to him. As Banner struggled to remain calm, he explained how he had experienced Hulk taking full control for the first time ever, an experience which had clearly shaken Banner as he refused to turn back into Hulk.

Thor learns Banner will not turn into Hulk
The pair then discussed how they planned to leave Sakaar and get back to Asgard, as Thor explained how he required Hulk's help in his attempts to stop Hela from taking over the Nine Realms. However, Banner, already highly agitated despite Thor's attempts to keep him calm, insisted all he wanted to do is go to Earth and be left in peace, not wishing to get involved with his family issue or fight any more evil beings, as he felt that Thor was just using him to get to Hulk.

Thor and Banner make their escape together
The pair got into a debate about if Banner would be useful in battling Hela's armies of Berserkers even without turning into Hulk, with Banner insisting that his seven PhDs made him useful, which Thor was unconvinced by. Finally, Banner agreed to accompany Thor to Asgard on the condition that he doesn't have to think about Hulk ever again before they both made their way through the streets, with Banner complaining that Tony Stark's clothing was too tight.

Thor is eventually reunited back with Valkyrie
Just as Thor promised Banner he would not have to think of Hulk anymore, they were separated in a Contest of Champions party. As the pair were briefly threatened by Biff only for Valkyrie to appear and use Biff's Obedience Disk to subdue him. While Thor had still insisted he could have subdued Biff himself, Valkyrie questioned who Banner was, failing to recognize Banner as Hulk, before taking them away for a private conversation while Thor awkwardly flirted with her.

Forming the Revengers
Thor is offered the assistance of Valkyrie
As Thor followed behind Valkyrie back into Sakaar, she explained to him how she had first come to the planet as a means of escaping her past having witnessed the Valkyries falling at Hela's hands millennia ago when she was the only survivor which caused her to turn to drink in misery on Sakaar. Valkyrie then agreed to help Thor in his mission to rescue the Asgardians, hoping that their mission could also involve the defeat of Hela which she had wanted for thousands of years. Thor accepted her help, explaining their team would be called the Revengers as he claimed they were all looking for revenge.

Thor is brought to the chained up Loki.
Valkyrie then showed her peace offering, a chained up Loki, as Thor confirmed this was not merely another illusion by throwing a bottle at Loki's head. While Loki spoke with Bruce Banner, Thor had explored Valkyrie's room and found her Dragonfang which Thor then admired. Valkyrie then discussed the best route to Asgard, suggested going through a wormhole to Xandar where they could quickly refuel until they had eventually made it back to Asgard in eighteen months.

Thor and Bruce Banner discussing their plan
Remembering what Heimdall had said to him, however, Thor then suggested they travel through the largest wormhole, which Valkyrie informed him was named the Devil's Anus, much to both Thor and Banner's surprise. Looking at the Anus, Valkyrie noted that they would need another ship as the Anus would tear her Warsong into pieces if they had attempted to use that, as Thor and Banner then discussed what they would need to survive the journey.

Thor telling stories of Loki's murderous tricks
While they discussed which ship to use, Loki then interrupted them, explaining that he no longer wanted to be stuck on Sakaar since he had fallen out of favor with Grandmaster. Although Loki told Thor he had Grandmaster's security codes which give him control over his systems, Banner expressed his distrust of Loki in the wake of the last Chitauri Invasion of Earth, while Thor retold a story of when Loki had turned into a snake and stabbed him when they were children.

Thor, Valkyrie, and Bruce Banner listen to Loki
While Loki suggested that they set Hulk free and allowing him to help them escape, Thor claimed he was lying as Valkyrie got excited. Thor then suggested that they start a revolution to help distract Grandmaster's guards while they stole Grandmaster's personal ship to escape. As they planned, Korg and Miek were broken out of their cell with the other Contest of Champions gladiators so they can begin their revolt as a distraction while the plan went underway.

Farewell to Loki
Thor prepares to fight again alongside Loki
As they went to find a ship, Thor and Loki had joined forces for the fight once again, with Loki refusing to discuss recent events with his brother, noting that communication was never the Asgardian Royal Family's strongest point. The brothers then armed themselves with Sakaaran Laser Rifles and proceeded to fire upon the small army of Sakaaran Guards who were standing in their way.

Thor fights against Grandmaster's guards
While taking cover, Loki noted that Odin had brought them together when he had taken Loki from Jotunheim, claiming that it was almost poetic that his death them break them apart for good. Thor continued firing while Loki unlocked the doorways, while still claiming that they might as well become strangers, before being threatened by another Sakaaran Guard who Thor dispatched by forcing him to fire into the ground which shot him into the air as they entered the elevator.

Thor and Loki discussing their futures apart
Once they got inside the elevator, Loki suggested that he should actually stay in Sakaar, which Thor immediately agreed with as he claimed it fit his brother's lawless and chaotic personality perfectly, much to Loki's surprise. Thor went on to admit that he had always thought the world of Loki and hoped they would always fight together. However, he had come to the conclusion that this would never happen due to their differences and they were better off going their separate ways, which resonated with Loki, who seemingly agreed.

Thor and Loki use their "Get Help" strategy
Knowing that they would soon encounter more of Grandmaster's guards, Thor suggested that they utilize their "Get Help" strategy, much to Loki's horror. Although he tried to object, Thor still managed to convince Loki as they ran out with Thor pretending Loki needed some medical assistance before throwing his brother at the Sakaaran Guards, knocking him out. Thor delighted in the successful strategy while Loki continued moaning about how humiliating it was.

Thor manages to deceive and subdue Loki
While they went to steal the Commodore from Grandmaster, Loki, inevitably, betrayed them as they are escaping, attempting to alert Grandmaster. However, Thor placed the Obedience Disk on his back, leaving him being shocked on the floor. Thor told his brother that he knew Loki will always be the God of Mischief, but had hoped that he would have shown some capacity for growth before leaving, with Loki still being shocked and the remote just out of reach.

Escape from Sakaar
Thor piloting the Commodore through Sakaar
Having taken control of the Commodore, Thor had then piloted the ship high over Sakaar while Grandmaster alerted his followers of the situation and ordered them to find and capture Thor, noting that he had also kidnapped Hulk. Thor was soon targeted by Grandmaster's Sakaaran ships until Valkyrie then flew by while onboard her own Warsong and then assisted Thor by shooting the other ships out of the sky.

Thor manages to regroup with Bruce Banner
While Bruce Banner was launched up inside the Commodore from Warsong, Thor soon found himself being shot at by Topaz. As they looked for weapons, Thor discovered that it was merely the leisure vehicle which Grandmaster used for orgies, much to the shared disgust of Thor and Banner. The pair then watched as Topaz destroyed Valkyrie's Warsong, only for Valkyrie to survive and launch herself onto the Commodore. When Thor told her to get inside, Valkyrie refused and then attacked the other ships.

Thor fights alongside Valkyrie
While Banner was left in complete control of the Commodore, Thor and Valkyrie proceeded to use their own Asgardian strength to rip Grandmaster's ships apart with their bare hands, with Valkyrie also using her Dragonfang to tear through the ship's armor plating. While Banner was able to cause Topaz to crash using Grandmaster's birthday firework display, Thor and Valkyrie destroyed the final ship before then leaping back onboard the Commodore together.

Thor prepares to fly through the Devil's Anus
Having taken out all of Grandmaster's defenses and finally gotten away from Sakaar, Thor and the Revengers had prepared themselves to fly through the Devil's Anus and head back towards Asgard so that they could stop Hela from completing her plans to take over the Nine Realms. As they avoided the debris that was flying through the Anus, they made their way to the gateway, expressing heavy friction which knocked them out just as they traveled through the wormhole.

Duel in the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf
Thor calls upon Hela to face against him
Thor, Valkyrie and Bruce Banner arrived on Asgard, as a result Hela began an assault on the fortress where Heimdall was hiding the Asgardians called her back to the throne room to fight. After a talk about Odin, Thor and Hela fought. Although Thor used Gungnir to attack Hela, he quickly found Hela to be the more skilled and powerful one out of the two.

Thor pinned down by Hela
Although he managed to hit her twice, Hela quickly recovered and blocked all his attack before sarcastically stating that she expected much more from Thor and then counter-attacking, lifting Thor off his feet and disarming him of Gungnir before choking him and saying he is worth nothing. Thor tried to fight back desperately using a pair of blades, but Hela easily outmatches and stabs Thor multiple times with her Necrosword. Hela struck him across the face, cutting out his eye.

Thor focuses on his power in his vision
Hela was too much for Thor and once again he had a vision of his father in Norway. Thor stated that Asgard has fallen. However, Odin told him that Asgard is not a place, it was a people. Thor stated he cannot defeat Hela without Mjølnir, but Odin reminded Thor that he is not a god of hammers, but the god of thunder; Mjølnir was only ever a focus for his powers and they are greater than Odin's.

Battle of the Rainbow Bridge
Thor regains all of his former lightning powers
Hela slammed Thor to the ground and taunted him, questioning what is he the god of. In response, Thor summoned a massive bolt of lightning and blasted away Hela, temporarily incapacitating her. Thor leaped onto the Rainbow Bridge to assist Loki's forces. This prompted smiles from his allies.

Thor executes his powers at full force
With his powers in full force, Thor carved through her army of Berserkers with ease. Thor manages to get through to Loki and Valkyrie after battling against the Berserkers. As the remaining Revengers assembled, Thor makes an obligation to Valkyrie to disband the team after all is done. Thor looked over to Hela and gets ready to a fight, as Loki suggested to hit her with a lighting blast but argues that he already hit with one of all his might and didn't work.

Thor continues to battle against Hela
Thor realized that as long as Asgard stands, Hela would hunt them down without stopping. Looking over the Statesman, Thor suggested that Asgard is not a place, it's a people. He and Loki agreed that as long as Asgard existed, Hela would grow more powerful. Thor stated that they should ensure Ragnarök, not stop it. Despite Thor's boldness, Loki ran off to go inside the vault. Thor looked over to Valkyrie and suggested to fight against Hela.

Thor acknowledges Surtur to Hela
While Loki flew the Commodore and went into the vault to revive Surtur, Thor and Valkyrie fought off Hela using their skills to harm her. Despite Thor having his powers in full force, Hela still managed to overpower him. Hela knocked Thor down and stated that he could not defeat her. However, at that moment, Loki unleashed Surtur who emerged from the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf. Valkyrie took the chance to knock down Hela, and Thor blasted Hela off from the Rainbow Bridge.

Destruction of Asgard
Thor witnesses the destruction of Asgard
The now much more powerful Surtur began laying waste to Asgard and even Hela was unable to stop him. Thor and Valkyrie were ready to stay in Asgard, hating the prophecy for it, until Hulk attacked Surtur, but Thor called him off. Hulk carried Thor and Valkyrie aboard the Statesman, which escapes as Asgard is utterly destroyed, leaving only asteroids behind.

Thor ponders his missing eye
As Thor put on his new eyepatch on, Loki walked into his room and remarked his new look as reminiscent to their father's. Thor, believing his brother had already left the ship, jokingly remarked if he was here, he would give him a hug. Thor threw an object towards Loki, but caught it quickly. Loki reassured him that he's really here. The two made their way towards the deck.

Heading Towards Earth
Thor is crowned as the King of Asgard
Thor, while wearing the eye patch, was then crowned King of the Asgardians and sat on a throne at the side of the Statesman. Heimdall requested on where to go now, to which Thor was unsure of. After trying to get any suggestions on where to go, he decided that they should set course for Earth to rebuild Asgard, perhaps in Norway as Odin suggested.

Infinity War
Encountering Thanos
Thor prepares to return to Earth with Loki
Spending months in space en route to Earth, Loki visited Thor and asked if it was a good idea to return to Earth, to which he said it was since everyone loves him there. Loki then declared, saying that he was talking about himself. Thor then assured to Loki that everything will be fine, only to watch a larger ship approaching them, to Thor and Loki's shock and horror.

Attack on the Statesman
Thor is utterly defeated by Thanos
The Statesman was soon boarded by Thanos and the Black Order. Though Valkyrie led half the people to escape pods, Thor remained behind and led the defense against the invaders only to be personally confronted and easily beaten to submission by Thanos.

Thor being vigorously tortured by Thanos
In his weakened state, Thor was taken hostage by Thanos in order to force Loki to surrender the Tesseract, something Thor believed had been destroyed with the rest of Asgard. Thanos then began torturing Thor with the Power Stone, leading to Loki revealing the Tesseract, prompting Thor to bitterly insult his brother and call him the worst. However, Loki soon revealed that he had merely been stalling for time so that Hulk could ambush Thanos and he proceeded to tackle Thor to safety. Though the gamma-beast initially gave a good account of himself, Thanos quickly triumphed over the Avenger.

Thor desperately attempts to attack Thanos
In his rage, Thor attempted to once again attack Thanos only to be swatted aside with ease and restrained in metal by Ebony Maw's telekinetic powers. Heimdall then used the last of his strength to summon the Bifrost and send Hulk to Earth so that he could warn the planet of Thanos, an act for which Thanos claimed his life much to Thor's rage who swore to kill the Titan in retaliation. Unamused, Ebony Maw simply gagged Thor.

Thor is tightly constricted by Ebony Maw
After Thanos had claimed the Space Stone within the Tesseract, he directed the Black Order to Earth for the Time and Mind Stones, allowing Thor to deduce Thanos himself was going after the Reality Stone. Loki then stepped forward and offered to renew his allegiance to Thanos, sparing a glance at Thor to try and inform him of his true intentions. Unfortunately, Thanos easily anticipated Loki's attack and betrayal and choked him to death, mocking Thor that his brother would not be "resurrected" this time.

Thor sadly mourns over Loki's corpse
With having his stone secured onto the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos used the Power Stone to destroy the remains of the Statesman before teleporting away. Freed from Maw's influence, Thor broke his restraints and fell to the ground, crawling over to Loki's corpse, openly grieving for his brother by his name only to get no response, as the Statesman exploded around them, Thor remained as the only survivor.

Rescued in Space
Thor meeting the Guardians of the Galaxy
Left for dead in the vastness of space, Thor's barely conscious body was found by the Guardians of the Galaxy who brought him aboard the Benatar. After Mantis probed his surface thoughts and emotions, she woke him at Star-Lord's command. Thor awoke abruptly before questioning his now armed saviors who they were. Given food and a blanket, Thor calmed down and told the Guardians that Thanos was on the warpath and that he had destroyed half of Xandar for the Power Stone. One of the Guardians, Gamora, was a defected member of the Black Order who informed Thor that Thanos' endgame was to use all the Infinity Stones to wipe out half of all life in the universe.

Thor explains the stones to the Guardians
Seeking revenge on the Titan, Thor attempted to commandeer the Benatar’s space pod to fly to Nidavellir and acquire a new weapon while directing the Guardians to Knowhere so they could secure the Reality Stone from the Collector, knowing it was the only possible objective Thanos would have. When questioned as to why, Thor revealed the Mind Stone and Time Stone were on Earth, and protected by the Avengers.

Thor bids farewell to the remaining Guardians
Once explaining who the Avengers are, Thor explained that he needed a new weapon to kill Thanos by going to Nidavellir. As Rocket Raccoon expressed interest in joining the mission, Thor allowed him and Groot to tag along, thinking Rocket as a rabbit who seemed like a noble leader. After Rocket proposed the idea of going with the mission, Thor bid the "morons" farewell, wishing them luck getting the Reality Stone.

Traveling to Nidavellir
Thor arrives and observes Nidavellir
Thor, Rocket Raccoon and Groot made for the Dwarven star forge of Nidavellir to forge a weapon powerful enough to kill Thanos. As Rocket comforted him over the loss of his family and people, Thor assured him that his pain has given him the focus needed for avenging them. However, upon arrival, they found the Realm devastated, the forge extinguished, and the Dwarves massacred.

Thor notices the Infinity Gauntlet's mold
Thor and Guardians aboard to the realm to go inside where they noticed the mold for the Infinity Gauntlet only for the Dwarf King, Eitri, to attack them in a fit of rage. Thor tries to calm down Eitri by telling it was him to which Eitri recognized him and stopped attacking. Eitri angrily told that Asgard was supposed to protect the Dwarves but Thor explained that it was destroyed.

Thor motivates Eitri to build a new weapon
Calmly sitting down, Eitri told Thor what he had done by being forced by Thanos to forge the Infinity Gauntlet to harness the power of the Infinity Stones, before being crippled and forced to watch his people executed. Understanding what Eitri has been gone through, Thor motivates him to build a new weapon by telling his mind was all important to building any arsenal, knowing that it feels like all hope has lost, declares that he and Eitri can kill Thanos.

Forging the Axe
Thor assists on creating Stormbreaker
Together with Eitri, Thor, Rocket, and Groot went to the ring and observed a mold that served as a powerful substance for a King's weapon. Since the ring had been frozen, Thor had the idea of using the pod to work around the gears to repair and restart Nidavellir's forge, in order to complete Stormbreaker, a powerful axe capable of killing Thanos and summon the Bifrost. However, the iris mechanism focusing the star's energy, required to heat the Uru metal ingots for the weapon, was crippled.

Thor unconscious and heavily wounded
Volunteering to physically hold the iris doors open, Thor opened the full brunt of the star's power to light the forge and allow Eitri to heat the metal and pour it into the mold. However, Thor fell unconscious partway through the process, shutting the iris and leaving the weapon without a handle. With Stormbreaker being the only thing that could heal Thor, Eitri searched for the handle to no avail. Having an idea, Groot used his own arm to create a handle, completing Stormbreaker.

Battle of Wakanda
Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive in Wakanda
As he recovered from his wounds with his new profound weapon, the trio had decided to leave Nidavellir and head to Earth. Summoning the Bifrost, Thor touched down into the land of Wakanda as the heroes in battle were in danger of being overrun by the Outriders, Thor's power quickly turning the tide of the battle and bringing hope to the humans.

Thor unleashing an attack on the Outriders
During the numerous attack on his allies, Thor threw Stormbreaker at the many Outriders that were hurdling away from them as well as the many that were attacking the rest of his teammates. Once Stormbreaker returned to his hand, closing the Bifrost, Thor proceeded to look over at the crowd of Outriders and began to run up to them while yelling at them about confronting Thanos, before attacking the abundance of them with one swing.

Thor introduces Groot to Steve Rogers
As the battle on Wakanda continues, Thor spent most of the battle on the ground and kill as many of Outriders as he can with multiple swings that proved fatal with each attack. Being noticed by Steve Rogers in the battle for his haircut, Thor quickly recognized his beard as he assumed that he copied his beard, following up, he introduces his new ally, Groot to Rogers, as he was killing a row of Outriders with one arm.

Thor attacks the remaining Outrider Dropships
As the battle was on the brink of winning, Thor flies over a hoard of Outriders that were leaving and heading towards the dropships to escape but were quickly executed with a swing in the air while summoning lighting. In the air, Thor flew upwards to get a view on his enemies and began to attack the numerous active dropships by slaughtering every single one of them as the battle had begun to end, with the Wakandan army celebrating their victory.

Arrival of the Titan
Thor violently attacks Thanos with lightning
When Thanos arrived, he managed to defeat everyone that stood in his way and successfully extracted the Mind Stone from Vision to complete the Infinity Gauntlet. As the Titan basked in his victory, Thor unleashed a devastating attack with Stormbreaker, knocking his foe back and prompting him to retaliate with an energy beam from the completed Gauntlet. Undeterred, Thor charged his axe with all his power and threw it with all his might, but chose to strike Thanos directly in the chest, so that he could taunt the Mad Titan to his face.

Thor plunges Stormbreaker into Thanos
With the axe overpowering him, Thor savored his revenge by reminding Thanos of his earlier promise to kill him for attacking his people, inflicting further pain on Thanos. Unfortunately, Thor underestimated Thanos' resilience and was mocked in the face for not having struck him in the head for an instant kill, catching him completely off-guard and before Thor could further injure Thanos, the Titan managed to muster the strength to snap his fingers as Thor yelled in horror, as the Gauntlet was activated and the energy that surged from it covered the battlefield with light and caused an ominous rumbling throughout the whole universe.

Thanos' Victory
Thor shocked at the damaged Infinity Gauntlet
Thor was left shocked by the Gauntlet's use by Thanos, and questioned what Thanos had done but he was ignored by the Mad Titan, who simply gave him a mocking smirk and activated the heavily damaged Infinity Gauntlet in front of him and disappeared with a portal conjured by the Space Stone, leaving Stormbreaker on the ground.

Thor realizes what Thanos had done
While recalling Gamora's words, Thor was stunned on how he failed to murder Thanos when he had the chance and that had caused Thanos to succeed in his goals. Unable to answer when Steve Rogers asked where Thanos had gone, Thor could only watch in horror as many of his allies and the rest of life on the universe had been disintegrated into dust, realizing the extent of his folly.

Life of Guilt
Arrival of Captain Marvel
Thor feeling the guilt following the Snap
Following the Snap, Thor and the remaining Avengers, along with Rocket Raccoon, returned to the New Avengers Facility. Feeling a great deal of guilt, seeing the Snap as his own personal failure, Thor became silent and separated from everyone else for the next few days. When they encountered Captain Marvel, she went out to rescuing Tony Stark from space.

Thor tests Carol Danvers with Stormbreaker
Captain Marvel eventually returned, landing the Benatar outside, but Thor did not come out, and even when they were all together inside, Thor sat in the other room. When Nebula revealed the location of Thanos, Thor stayed silent as the Avengers discussed their next move. When Captain Marvel suggested just going to Thanos and taking the Infinity Stones, Thor finally joined in, testing the new arrival by summoning Stormbreaker, which she did not flinch from. He then expressed his reverence for her and they all prepared for the mission.

Ambush on Thanos
Thor realizing the Infinity Stones are gone
They all then suited up and boarded the Benatar, where they began their journey to the Garden. Once they arrived, Captain Marvel did recon on the planet, detecting only Thanos to be there. After Captain Marvel's first move, War Machine and Bruce Banner entered the hut and restrained him, allowing Thor to burst in and slice of Thanos' left hand, separating him from the Infinity Gauntlet.

Thor cuts off Thanos' head
However, when Rocket Raccoon turned over the Gauntlet, they discovered that the Infinity Stones were gone. They began to desperately demand Thanos to reveal where the stones were, but he told them that he had destroyed them due to his plan being fulfilled and them having no other use. While everyone tried to think that Thanos was lying, Thor just stood in the realization that he had failed once again.

Thor leaving the Garden after killing Thanos
After Nebula confirmed that Thanos was telling the truth, Thor cut off his head in a rage, fulfilling his revenge and calling back to what Thanos had told him previously about going for the head. However, this was no victory for Thor, but just an emotional impulse coming from his own inability to handle failure, for which he felt even more now. With no other purpose of staying, a shaken Thor then storms out of the hut and returned to the Benatar.

New Asgard
Thor in his deep state of depression
Even though the Ambush on Thanos failed, there were still some Asgardians who had survived Thanos' attack, so Thor brought them to Earth, where he transformed Tønsberg to be the New Asgard, of which Thor would resume his rule as King. Thor, following the words of Korg after the Destruction of Asgard, allowed the survivors of the Sakaaran Rebellion to also inhabit the land.

However, over the next five years, Thor would fall into a deep state of depression, which he would deny with stories that depict his killing of Thanos as epic rather than the actual tragic reality. He also suppressed his grief through alcoholism, causing him to gain serious weight, coming at the cost of most of his strength, leaving him sufficiently weaker than he was before. Thor's isolation would be at the detriment of his people and Valkyrie's disappointment, as despite his attempts to assure himself he is fine, he knew he was struggling.

Returning to the Avengers
Thor reunites with Bruce Banner
In 2023, Rocket Raccoon and Bruce Banner visited New Asgard to recruit Thor back to the Avengers to help retrieve the Infinity Stones from the past to reverse the Snap. As the two Avengers entered his home, Thor initially believed them to be the repair people for the cable. But, as he retrieved another drink, he saw that it was his friends, for which he was happily surprised by. He enthusiastically hugged them both, as they were surprised after seeing Thor in his different state.

Thor threatens NoobMaster69
Their reunion was interrupted by Korg, who notified Thor of an abusive Fortnite player called NoobMaster69, who was insulting him and Miek. Infuriated, Thor threatened NoobMaster and promised to hurt him if he continued with the insults. As he returned to his drinking, Banner asked how he was going, to which Thor claimed that he was fine. Thor then asked about what they were up to, which Banner revealed that they came to get his help to reverse the Snap.

Thor becomes emotional from Thanos' name
However, when Banner mentioned Thanos' name, Thor immediately broke down and threatened Banner to not say that name. Banner then tried to comfort his friend, but Thor continued his denial, trying to use the fact that he killed Thanos as a proud achievement. Banner, understanding the struggle Thor was going through, reminded his friends of how he helped him through his own struggles, reminding him that he helped him get out of his predicament on Sakaar.

Thor accepts the offer to rejoin the Avengers
But Thor refused to join them, addressing how he viewed himself as a lousy King to his people, at least the ones that were left. Thor then tried to relieve his friends worries by assuring them that he was truly fine and then rejected their request. However, he soon changed his mind once Rocket informed him that there was beer on the Benatar.
