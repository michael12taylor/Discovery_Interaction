Scott Edward Harris Lang is a former convicted thief who was struggling to pay child support to his estranged wife for visitation rights to his daughter, Cassie Lang. With the promise of money, he was convinced by Hank Pym to take on the mantle of Ant-Man: a superhero with an advanced suit designed to shrink its wearer to a tiny size while increasing one's toughness, agility, and physical strength. Trained under both Hank and his daughter Hope van Dyne, Lang was to help foil Hank's former protege Darren Cross, who was intending to sell his Yellowjacket Suit design and his copy of the Pym Particles formula to HYDRA and the Ten Rings. However, their plan was discovered by Cross, culminating in a final fight between Cross and Ant-Man. To defeat Cross, Lang had to shrink small enough to enter Cross' Yellowjacket suit and destroy it, sending Lang to the Quantum Realm, but Lang was able to escape. Lang's heroism helped restore his relationship with Cassie and his ex-wife, as well as find a new romantic one with Hope. Lang soon learned that the Avengers were seeking to recruit him.

Against Hank and Hope's wishes, Lang joined Captain America's side during the Avengers Civil War, having been recommended by the Falcon following their previous encounter at the New Avengers Facility, and being informed of Helmut Zemo's plan to awaken the Winter Soldiers. Ant-Man fought against Iron Man and his allies, demonstrating his suit's new ability to enlarge his body to a gigantic size, and allowing Captain America and Winter Soldier to escape and find Zemo. Ant-Man and several of his new allies were then arrested by Thaddeus Ross, who had them imprisoned in the Raft for breaking the Sokovia Accords. When Captain America arrived to free them, Ant-Man and Hawkeye chose not to escape, instead making a deal with the FBI to be put under house arrest so that they could still spend time with their own families.

Three days before Lang could finish his sentence, he had a strange vision of Janet van Dyne, who had remained trapped inside the Quantum Realm, and with whom Lang became psychically entangled with when he was there. This resulted in Lang being kidnapped by Hank and Hope, who had built a Quantum Tunnel machine and intended to use it and Lang to rescue Janet. These plans went awry when Lang and Hope (who had become the new "Wasp") were confronted by both Ghost and Sonny Burch, who wanted to steal the Quantum Tunnel machine for their own selfish reasons. Lang, Hope, and Hank eventually succeeded in rescuing Janet from the Quantum Realm, and Lang was able to return home to finish his house arrest, narrowly avoiding an extended prison sentence.

However, during a trip to the Quantum Realm to gather quantum particles for Ghost, Lang became trapped as Hank Pym's entire family was turned to dust by Thanos following the Snap, along with half of all life in the universe. Lang was unable to escape until 2023, where he regrouped with the Avengers and suggested that they use the Quantum Realm as a means of time travel to the past. Ant-Man then officially joined the Avengers and participated in the Time Heist, where they successfully managed to acquire the six Infinity Stones from alternate pasts and brought them to their timeline, using the Stones to resurrect the victims of Thanos' Snap. However, an alternate version of Thanos had managed to follow the Avengers through time, and Ant-Man would fight in the resulting Battle of Earth. Thanos and his army were eventually destroyed, after which Lang celebrated the victory with Hope and Cassie, and attended Tony Stark's funeral.

Biography
Early Life
Raising a Family
Scott Lang had earned a master's degree in electrical engineering. With his skills, he would often steal from criminals and give back to those they had stolen from. Lang married a woman named Maggie sometime before 2007. Maggie was very supportive of Lang, but disliked his robberies, albeit from criminals. The couple later had a daughter whom they named Cassandra "Cassie" Lang. Wishing to support his own family, Lang promised his wife that he would stop stealing after Cassie's birth and took up a job at the security company Vistacorp.

The VistaCorp Job
Lang breaking inside Geoff Zorick's Mansion
Lang discovered that Vistacorp was overcharging its customers. At first, he thought it was simply a coding error and changed it. He then realized the company was intentionally doing this to their customers for financial gain when Geoff Zorick, ordered Lang to revert his many corrections before firing him. Angered by VistaCorp's larceny, Lang broke into the Vistacorp Headquarters to hack their systems and pay back the money to Vistacorp's customers. He then broke into Geoff Zorick's Mansion and stole a few items before he got carried away and drove Zorick's car into the mansion's pool.

Prison Sentence and Divorce
Lang is arrested for his crimes and sent to jail
Lang was arrested and given a three-year sentence in San Quentin State Prison. The Langs divorced following his incarceration, and Maggie eventually became engaged to Jim Paxton. Lang became very close to his cellmate, Luis, who was released the year before Lang was set to be. During his time in prison, Lang vowed to never get involved in crime again and focus his attention on helping to raise Cassie.

A Biased Interview
Lang being interviewed by Christine Everhart
A day before his release from San Quentin State Prison, Lang was interviewed by Christine Everhart at WHiH World News. They talked about the reason behind his heist at Vistacorp; however, Lang felt that the news station was being unfair, due to Vistacorp being their parent company.

Lang being subdued by one of the guards
His animosity towards the remarks made by the seemingly biased news anchor, caused him to slam his hand onto the desk in frustration, resulting in him getting tased by police guard.

Release from San Quentin
Job Search
Lang undergoes the prison's goodbye rituals.
On July 17, 2015, Lang was released for proper conduct during his stay in the San Quentin State Prison. Before being pardoned, Lang underwent a traditional good-bye ritual where he fought an inmate called Peachy. Lang allowed Peachy to hit him hard across the jaw and successfully stayed on his feet, he then retaliated by hitting his friend in the stomach, which Peachy did not react to. Lang then attempted to distract Peachy and punched him, still failing to knock him down before he and the prisoners embraced.

Lang is released from prison at long last
Having said his goodbyes, Lang was finally escorted out of prison, having been freed in the wake of robbing Vistacorp and allowed to have his freedom at last. Being taken outside by two armed guards, Lang was then picked up by Luis. The pair happily embraced before Luis questioned how Lang had gained a cut across his eye, with Lang explaining it had come from Peachy while Luis recalled gaining his own scar from his goodbye punch from Peachy and boasting that he was the only one to ever knock him out with a single punch while they both got into his van to leave.

Lang catches up with Luis while driving
As they drove towards San Francisco, Lang thanked his friend for coming all that way out to pick him up before asking how Luis' own relationship with his girlfriend was going, only for Luis to tell him that she had left him. Luis then informed Lang that much of his own life had gone bad, Luis' mother died and his father had gotten deported, all while Lang had been in prison, although Luis still looked on the positive side; at least he gained his parents' van, which Lang complimented was very nice, much to Luis' utter delight while they continued to make their way to the city to restart Lang's life.

Lang finally returns back to San Francisco
On the way to The Milgrom Hotel where Lang had been offered a sofa to sleep on for at least his first few weeks of being out of prison and back in the real world, Luis informed Lang of a place they could rob, claiming that he had recruited some highly skilled people who could assist them. However, Lang flat out rejected the idea and claimed that he would not be sent back to prison due to having a daughter he had vowed to focus his efforts on. As Lang was remaining confident that he would be able to find a job, as he still had a Master's Degree in electronics, Luis however, warned that ex-convicts usually struggled to get employment, although Lang insisted he would be fine.

Lang gets a terrible job at Baskin-Robbins
Lang obtained a job at Baskin-Robbins, going by the name of Jack; despite his degree in electronics, his criminal record would prevent him from getting a job as most potential employers would think he would revert back to crime, so going by an alias was the best choice. One day, he got a dimwitted teenager as a customer, who kept asking for things that an ice cream shop did not sell. Despite all Lang's polite encouragement to realize he was in the wrong place for those orders, Dale, his manager, called for him allowing Lang to ask a fellow employee to handle the dimwit while he was gone.

Lang is soon fired from Baskin-Robbins
Inside Dale's office, Lang learned that Baskin-Robbins had found out about his past as the well-known criminal who was responsible for robbing Geoff Zorick and returning all of their money to his former customers and being sent to San Quentin State Prison. Though a fan of his work against the corrupt Vistacorp, Dale was forced to fire Lang due to him lying on his application. Though as some consolation, Dale allowed Lang to take a free smoothie with him when he left and despite him being mortified by Dale's attitude to the situation, Lang took the free smoothie regardless and made his way back home.

Lang is introduced to Dave and Kurt Goreshter
Arriving at the residence, Lang explained how he had just been fired before being introduced to Kurt Goreshter and Dave, whom Luis had rounded up in hopes of helping in his planned heist if Lang agreed. Luis excitedly explained that Kurt had just gotten out of Folsom Prison and went into great detail about Lang's criminal career. He quickly realized what was happening and once again insisted that he would not be going back to stealing as he intended to support his daughter, despite Luis' insistence that the billionaire they would be targeting would be the perfect victim. Lang still refused.

Unwelcome Family Reunion
Lang is reunited with his daughter Cassie
On the very same day was Cassie Lang's birthday party, which was being held at Jim Paxton's house. Although he was not invited to the party she was having, Lang turned up at Paxton's home. Cassie was delighted to see him and hugged her father tightly; he managed to give his gift to Cassie despite the cold treatment Paxton gave him. Ignoring Paxton's comments about him not being invited to the party, Lang handed his daughter her birthday present, an ugly rabbit toy which she instantly adored.

Lang has an argument with his ex-wife
Cassie then went to inform her mother of Lang's sudden arrival, much to Lang's dismay at being left with Paxton who berated him for failing to pay child support. When his ex-wife Maggie appeared, she asked to speak to Lang outside of their house. From there, they discussed a little bit of what Lang must do before he can visit Cassie again, with Lang insisting that he had a job and was not going back to crime before Maggie demanded that he leave their home and come back once he had gotten himself a job and was able to begin finally paying child support he currently owed to them.

Lang agrees to take the job with Luis' crew
Lang was left depressed by this turn of events, as by the time he had saved enough money to pay child support to his ex-wife, he would have missed another two years of Cassie's life. This forced him to listen to Luis' proposal about a crime, to make quick cash. It turned out that the target was the safe belonging to a retired mogul whose money would be protected by insurance so nobody would really be hurt, the kind of target perfect for Lang's morals. With Lang now officially on board, they quickly began planning with Kurt Goreshter and Dave as Lang took charge of the planning of the heist.

Breaking Into Pym's Residence
Lang breaks into the Pym Residence
With the help of his newly-found heist team, Lang was able to break into the Pym Residence easily, with Luis staying nearby and offering support from inside his van. Lang was soon slowed down, however, when he discovered the basement door had a fingerprint scanner he had not planned for. Rather than giving up, Lang recreated a fingerprint using a ring, tape, glue, and some heat from the stove, unlocking the door and making his way downstairs.

Lang discovers the second vault doorway
Lang found the vault, which was made of the same 1910s material as the RMS Titanic and sparked a brief conversation between Dave and Kurt Goreshter about the 1997 Titanic movie. Thinking on his feet, Lang promptly created a freezing agent and poured it into the door, Lang explained to his confused friends over the radio that "ice expands, metal doesn't"; in a few minutes, the ice with burst the door open. He set up a blanket to catch the screws flying out and a mattress to soften the door's fall, and therefore keep any loud noises from alerting the nearby neighbors.

Lang finds and steals the Ant-Man Suit
As soon as the door was blown open, Lang immediately scanned the room for cash and other valuables, only to find nothing but a few hanging blueprints, some colored liquid contained in test tubes, and a suit with a helmet that seemed to be as a pair of motorcycling attire, informing Luis and the other two of the failure to find anything clearly worth any money. Disappointed that all the security was just for an old outfit, Lang decided to take it anyway for his troubles; he likely planned to sell it at a later point to make a profit off this venture. Unknown to Lang, Hank Pym had been watching everything he did, with a camera mounted on the back of an ant.

Trials of the Suit
Lang carefully examines the Pym Particles
The following day back at The Milgrom Hotel, Lang was alone in the apartment and looking himself in the mirror, considering what he should do next. Taking some time to look at what he stole, Lang studied the Pym Particles, unaware of their power before examining the Ant-Man Suit and there was a helmet, still assuming them to just be motorcycle gear.

Lang tries on the suit for the first time
Seeing that the suit was about his size, Lang then checked the suit and tried it on, standing in the bath to get a better look as he began admiring himself in the mirror. Looking over the suit's design, Lang saw buttons on each glove and began experimenting with them, while nothing happened when he pushed the one on the left glove, he pushed the one on the right, suddenly shrinking to a minuscule size, with even the plug hole of the bath appearing much larger than he was. He promptly fell a great distance into the tub, frightened by his new perspective as he tried to figure out what had just happened and how this could be possible.

Lang runs from the water flow
While Lang continued to panic, Hank Pym used this chance to get through the suit and communicate with Lang, mocking him for his confusion about what was happening and explaining that this would be a trial by fire. During their conversation, Luis arrived and stepped into the bathroom for a bath, causing Lang to have to run for his life as Luis turned on the tap, flooding the bath. The water caught up to Lang who was thrown from the bath and soon fell through a gap in the floor to the apartment below where he landed on a record player and held on as he was spun around uncontrollably.

Lang continues to suffer as the Ant-Man
Lang continued to be thrown across the room without being noticed due to his small size, suffering from landing inside a vacuum cleaner and being attacked by a rat. As Lang desperately ran away from the rat, he crashed into a mouse trap which launched him high into the air and out of a window, where he fell to the street below and landed on a car roof. While lying on the rooftop, Lang finally figured out how to grow back to normal size and freaked out about what he had just witnessed, wanting nothing more to do with the suit and its power.

Lang is arrested outside the Pym Residence
Lang broke back into the Pym Residence again to return the suit to the safe. However, on his way out, he was caught by police officers called by Hope van Dyne who were waiting outside. Without thinking, Lang attempted to defend himself by claiming that he was not stealing anything but was instead returning something that he had stolen. This tactic failed, as he should have left out the part about being the one who had robbed the house in the first place, and Lang was handcuffed and taken straight back to jail.

Prison Break
Lang is judged by Jim Paxton in his cell
Jim Paxton expressed his disappointment to find Lang back in jail again when they thought he had turned for the good and had believed it ever since he had left San Quentin State Prison. Lang was more than annoyed, as Paxton was married to his ex-wife. Paxton's partner Gale came and told him he had a visitor. When Lang asked who it was, the officer simply said that it was his lawyer and then brought him into the visiting room.

Lang is finally introduced to Hank Pym
Lang was greeted by Hank Pym, who was keeping his visit secret by using Ants to block the camera. Pym revealed to Lang that he was behind the heist by getting the information to Luis in order to pass it to Lang. Pym explained that he did all this to test if he got the right man to succeed as the Ant-Man. Lang then wanted to tell that he'd take no part in it anymore, but Pym persuaded him by helping him with Cassie if he agreed to become the Ant-Man. Pym told Lang he should take this second chance and, having given Lang the option, Pym left using the ants to mask his departure.

Lang uses the Ant-Man Suit to escape
Not long after Pym departed, a few ants visited Lang's cell with the Ant-Man Suit, which was promptly re-enlarged with the Pym Particles for him to wear. They formed the number ten and began counting down, which told Lang that he only had a few seconds to don the suit and shrink out of the cell. Lang did so and was congratulated by Pym over the radio for finally listening to what he had told him. Following Pym's instructions, Lang escaped the cell by running below the bars just as Gale arrived and alerted the other police officers of Lang's mysterious disappearance.

Lang gets a lift from Hank Pym's ant army
Making his way outside, Lang made his escape by running out the door and being greeted by a team of ants, one of whom had a camera which Pym used to watch his movements. Lang jumped on the back of a carpenter ant and flew to safety high over the streets of San Francisco while the police department desperately searched for him. As they flew over the city and hitched a ride on the side of a police car, Lang asked Pym questions about the ants until he eventually fell unconscious due to feeling lightheaded from the shock of everything he had been through with this new technology.

Hank Pym's Mission
Lang is greeted by Hope van Dyne
The next day, Lang woke up in a bed only to find Hope van Dyne standing at the end of the bed watching him. Van Dyne explained that she had been watching him all night because the last time Lang was at the Pym Residence he had robbed them. Lang was then invited down to breakfast, having to dodge the fire Ants that littered the floor around him.

Lang listens to Hank Pym's explanation
Lang joined Van Dyne and Hank Pym downstairs at their coffee table. Pym then revealed that it was Van Dyne who had Lang arrested for stealing the Ant-Man Suit and explained that she did not think Lang was needed for their upcoming heist. Pym explained he had been watching Lang ever since the Vistacorp robbery as he felt his skills would be useful for them, while Lang was distracted by the ants moving across the table and obeying all of Pym's commands. He eventually decided to question everything that was happening and why he was there in the first place.

Lang and Pym discuss the Yellowjacket Suit
As they both went downstairs, Pym explained that while he had been working with S.H.I.E.L.D. he had created the Pym Particles, only to decide they were too dangerous and hid them from the world, building Pym Technologies. Pym took on a young protege called Darren Cross who went on to betray him trying to recreate the Pym Particles. Pym told Lang that Cross had almost completed the Yellowjacket Suit which had the potential to destroy the world. Lang agreed to help, claiming his days of being a thief were over, except Pym explained that he needed Lang to be a thief and steal the Yellowjacket suit before Cross could sell it.

Lang agrees to assist in Hank Pym's mission
As Pym explained that Mitchell Carson was planning on buying the Yellowjacket, Lang suggested calling the Avengers but Pym refused; explaining that he had spent years keeping the technology away from Howard Stark and noting how Tony Stark misused technology to create Ultron. Lang questioned why Pym was not going and he explained that he was unable to use the suit anymore due to a toll it took on his body. Van Dyne also questioned if Lang was right for the job, leading to a brief argument until Lang agreed to steal the suit from Cross. In exchange, Pym would have Lang employed so that Lang could pay child support in order to retain visitation rights for his daughter.

Becoming Ant-Man
Beginning Training
Lang begins his training with the Ant-Man Suit
To begin their training, Hank Pym then gave Lang the task of running towards a closed door and jumping through the keyhole while tiny, then use the Pym Particles to return back to normal size; this was the first test of mastering how to alter size with the Ant-Man Suit at the right time. While Lang remained confident, he failed time after time again, much to the annoyance of both Hope van Dyne and Pym. Hope was secretly amused by Lang's failings, as she believed that she would have done better than all of his failed attempts.

Lang carefully studies the Ant-Man Suit
Having struggled with the tests he was given by both Pym and Van Dyne as he was still unable to leap through the keyhole correctly without crashing into the door and injuring himself, Lang decided to take it upon himself to try and use his own engineering skills to improve the design of the Ant-Man Suit, seeking a way to redesign the Ant-Man Suit in order to get the advantage over Darren Cross before they would steal the Yellowjacket Suit from him. With this in his mind, Lang took the suit into the Pym Residence basement and began taking it apart to understand exactly how it worked.

Lang is warned about the Quantum Realm
While Lang was pulling the suit apart and studying the different pieces of technology, he was found and confronted by Pym. Lang explained that he intended to rework the regulator on the suit, but was told that if he did, then he would risk going subatomic. Lang questioned what Pym meant by this and was told he would enter the Quantum Realm where he would then become trapped for all time in the dark section of the Multiverse, with Pym hinting that he knew someone this had happened to. Now aware of the dangers, Lang agreed not to mess with the regulator.

Combat Training
Lang is combat trained by Hope van Dyne
For all the physical parts of stealing the Yellowjacket Suit, Lang had to prepare himself for knocking out the guards as he made his way to the suit. He was then trained by Hope van Dyne. She explained to Lang that the wearer of the Ant-Man Suit must control their strength or they could kill. Hope said she would teach him how to punch but Lang scoffed at this, noting he was in San Quentin State Prison for three years for robbing Vistacorp so he knew how to punch, having hit Peachy.

Lang is soon subdued by Hope van Dyne
Lang invited van Dyne to show him how to punch, lifting up his hand for her, but she responded by punching him in the face and knocking him to the ground. They were joined by Hank Pym who noted with great amusement that van Dyne had been looking forward to fighting Lang, explaining she had been trained in Muay Thai since a young age. It was noted by van Dyne that she had begun training when her own mother had died, saying that Pym had never told her the truth about her mother's death. As Pym left, Lang got up and questioned if van Dyne had aimed her punch for his hand or his face.

Lang tends to all of his many new injuries
They trained together and neither one held back with their fighting styles, with Lang quickly learning that van Dyne was not a woman to be underestimated as she was a superior fighter compared to him. As Lang's fighting skills improved under van Dyne's training, he became cocky, mocking van Dyne when he landed a strike on her, only to be quickly silenced when van Dyne would pin him to the ground and twist his arm back, forcing him to yield. Lang soon found himself covered with bruises and cuts, which he patched up, being watched by van Dyne as he tended to all of his injuries.

Lang and Hank Pym use Pym Particles Disks
Lang was informed by van Dyne that Pym wanted to see him outside of the Pym Residence in order to train with target practice. Pym then showed Lang his new Pym Particles Disks, noting that because the Ant-Man Suit did not have any actual weapons, he had decided to design and make these, which would use the Pym Particles to either strike or enlarge items without killing. Pym demonstrated this to Lang by throwing the discs at his garden gnomes which tripled in size upon contact with the disks before Lang and Pym practiced throwing the disks at their targets to master the skill for the mission.

Meeting the Ants
Ant-Man is sent to meet his new ant allies
Being taken into the basement, Hank Pym told Lang that while he was still learning how to control the Ant-Man Suit, it was also time that he met and mastered controlling his most important allies for their mission, the Ants themselves. Donning the Ant-Man suit, Lang was sent into the Pym Residence garden to explore the tunnels created by the ants while Hope van Dyne and Pym watched him from the sidelines.

Ant-Man first encounters the crazy ants
While inside the tunnels, Lang first encountered the small crazy ant, which could be used to conduct electricity and also carry cameras and other devices into Pym Technologies Headquarters to help him fry the security systems before Lang would be able to attempt to then steal the Yellowjacket Suit. Lang at first viewed it as cute and allowed it to climb on top of him. However, when the rest of the small army of ants charged in and surrounded Lang, he freaked out and returned to normal size, slightly embarrassed as Lang burst through the ground while Pym and van Dyne were still watching all his actions.

Ant-Man befriends and feeds Ant-thony
The next stage of Lang's training involved meeting the army of flying carpenter ants which would assist Lang to his missions by flying him inside. There, he was reintroduced to the ant that flew him out of San Quentin State Prison. Lang almost immediately developed a strong connection to the ant, feeding him some water and even renaming him Ant-thony, which Pym approved of as he told Lang that he would soon need to master communicating with all of the ants ready for the mission by using the EMP Communication Device, tasking him with telling some of the ants to put some sugar in a mug of tea.

Ant-Man runs alongside his teams of ants
Lang was introduced to a group of bullet ants, which he remembered as the kind that had covered the bedroom floor when he had awoken in the Pym Residence. When the ants charged at Lang, he yet again freaked out and used the Pym Particles to regrow to normal size. Finally, Pym showed Lang all of the fire ants which could be used as natural architects and transport Lang throughout tight corners and difficult to move locations by creating long structures, like rafts and bridges. Lang tested out his skills of communication with the Ants as he ran down the tunnels with them all as his tiny army.

Mission Planning
Lang is briefed on their new mission plans
While still attempting to master all of the skills he would need for the mission, Lang was also briefed by Hank Pym on exactly how they planned to infiltrate the Pym Technologies Headquarters in order to finally steal the Yellowjacket Suit. Lang was informed that the headquarters had guards by the security systems, explaining that they would need to take out the guard in order to turn off the security and then retrieve the Yellowjacket Suit without being caught.

Lang becomes concerned about the mission
Lang listened closely as Hope van Dyne explained to him how the Yellowjacket Suit was currently secured within a pod which was hermetically sealed and the only access point is a tube that they had estimated to be about five millimeters in diameter. Lang noted he was getting sick to his stomach as van Dyne explained he would have to get the Ants to shut off the power to the laser grid so he could collect the suit and get out within fifteen seconds when the backup power would come on, all before Darren Cross could even discover their deception, a plan which worried Lang.

Hank Pym's Confession
Lang attempts to communicate with the Ants
Despite all of his work in trying to master his new abilities, Lang still found it almost impossible to successfully communicate with all of the Ants, much to the continued frustration of Hank Pym. Believing that their chances of successfully completing their mission with Lang as the Ant-Man were now nearly impossible, Hope van Dyne once again proved that she was the better choice for the mission by demonstrating how she could easily communicate with the ants.

Lang makes a connection with Hope van Dyne
Eventually, Pym ordered van Dyne to stop, causing her to get in her father's face and tell him that she did not understand why she ever thought he could help stop Darren Cross in the first place before storming out of the Pym Residence in frustration. Pym then told Lang that they could complete the plan without van Dyne's assistance so Lang followed van Dyne out and listened as van Dyne explained how her relationship with Pym had fallen apart ever since her mother, Janet van Dyne had died, noting that Pym had never explained how she had died and sent her to boarding school as a result.

Lang finally communicates with the Ants
When van Dyne claimed Pym chose Lang to be the Ant-Man as he did not trust her, Lang corrected her by noting that it was because he did not want to lose her like he had lost his wife, noting that Pym had clearly viewed him as expendable. Van Dyne then apologized for having Lang arrested by Jim Paxton, noting that she did not know he had a daughter at the time. Feeling a closer connection to Lang now, van Dyne gave him back the EMP Communication Device before she then assisted him in mastering communication with the ants, as Lang successfully made the ants spin a coin with his mind.

Lang ruins Pym and van Dyne's own moment
As Lang and van Dyne returned to the Pym Residence, they were greeted by Hank Pym, who told van Dyne that her mother worked with him at S.H.I.E.L.D. under the codename of the Wasp and had been become trapped within the Quantum Realm when she saved the United States of America from a Soviet missile attack. Having learned the truth, van Dyne finally forgave her father and the two embraced. The emotional and intimate moment between Pym and his daughter ended when Lang commented on the beauty of the moment, unintentionally ruining it before quickly leaving.

Ant-Man rides on the back of Ant-thony
With new confidence in his team, Lang excelled at the other forms of his training to prepare to break into Pym Technologies and soon steal the Yellowjacket Suit. Much to his delight, Lang perfected leaping through a keyhole in the Ant-Man Suit and communicating with the ants to form a tiny army ready to be used for infiltration. Lang even bonded with one ant which he named Ant-thony. Meanwhile, Pym continued to work with the Pym Particles while Lang helped load tiny cameras onto the backs on the ants to allow Pym and van Dyne a way to watch the mission unfold in real time.

Duel at the New Avengers Facility
Ant-Man rides Ant-thony towards his mission
Confident that his training was going well, Hank Pym sent Lang on a mission retrieve a Signal Decoy which was being held inside of an old building that was used by Howard Stark, citing that this device would later assist Lang when it came time to steal the Yellowjacket Suit from Darren Cross. However, it had turned out Pym's intel was long-outdated, as this "storage facility" had since been converted into the New Avengers Facility, much to Lang's utter horror.

Ant-Man attempts to reason with the Falcon
Pym told Lang to return to San Francisco. Instead, Lang still decided to go to the facility and landed on the roof leading to an encounter with Falcon, who was guarding the facility. Despite believing his small size would keep him undetected, Lang found that Falcon's goggles were able to zoom in on him. Lang attempted to explain his situation to Falcon, being polite and introducing himself while also noting that he was a big fan of the Avengers. Falcon did not believe his claims and attempted to arrest Lang, forcing Lang to shrink in size.

Ant-Man attempts to avoid Falcon's attacks
While the confused Falcon attempted to figure out where the now tiny Lang had disappeared to, Ant-Man then launched up and hit him in the face, resulting in Falcon activating his EXO-7 Falcon which had knocked Ant-Man off the roof with a gust of wind. Although he tried to escape, Ant-Man was quickly spotted by Falcon who then tried to shoot at him, with Ant-Man hiding beside the gun barrel and then defending himself. During the fight, Lang used the Ant-Man Suit and his new fighting skills to keep up with Falcon, although he continually apologized for being forced to hit him during their skirmish.

Ant-Man is forced to battle against Falcon
Despite Lang using his size to his advantage, Falcon was eventually able to land a hard punch on his, causing the Pym Particles to revert Lang to his normal size. While Hank Pym furiously ordered Lang to stop what he was doing, Lang continued fighting as the Falcon hit him repeatedly and flew him high up into the air. However, Lang still remained determined to complete his current mission as he had been instructed to do and managed to use his suit's shrinking abilities and the Falcon's own technology to his advantage, dragging the Falcon across the ground before launching him through the air.

Ant-Man tries to disable the EXO-7 Falcon
Eventually, seeing that Falcon would still be able to spot him in the grass, Lang called Ant-thony to assist him by quickly flying him inside the facility where he soon stole the device. Having taken the device as Pym and Hope van Dyne had ordered him to do, Ant-Man managed to hide from the Falcon as Lang prepared to try and new tactic to defeat him and then make his escape. As the Falcon again attempted to stop him from getting away, Ant-Man shrunk down and entered inside of the EXO-7 Falcon Suit and attempted to disable it by ripped out all of the wires from within the suit itself.

Ant-Man manages to escape from Falcon
As a result, the Falcon's wings began to malfunction, causing him to crash through the doors and back outside as Lang still continued to apologize for doing any harm to a member of the Avengers. Despite Falcon spinning around to attempt and throw Ant-Man out of his suit, Falcon eventually crash landed and was unable to find Ant-Man, with Lang escaping the facility with the help of Ant-thony, while the Falcon insisted that Captain America never learn of the incident. This brief skirmish between them greatly impressed Falcon, who was on a lookout for some new and talented people to join the Avengers.

Complicating the Plan
Lang learns Darren Cross is in the house
As the group discussed the heist, Darren Cross arrived at the Pym Residence, planning to kill Hank Pym, but he chose against it. Not wanting Cross to see the plans, Lang had ants roll them up. Cross eventually left but he called Hope van Dyne to tell her that he was beefing up security. At this point, Cross knew Hank was the previous Ant-Man and worried that he might try to steal the Yellowjacket Suit, so he ensured that security measures were taken that could detect even the tiniest living beings, including a person the size of an ant.

Lang shows off the Ant-Man Suit
Knowing that they would need help with getting past the extra security, Lang, despite Pym's misgivings, sought the aid of Luis, Kurt Goreshter, and Dave. He showed them how the suit worked managing to scare them into thinking it was magic briefly. After being briefed on the plan, Scott let Hope drug them with Xanax while Hank bored them by explaining the suit's science; as a result, the three got to spend some quiet time on the rest of the plan.

Stealing the Yellowjacket
Lang commands Ant-thony during the heist
Despite the logistical setbacks imposed by Cross, the team still managed to infiltrate the facility while Cross was holding an important event. Luis, posing as a security guard, gained access to the building's water main and shut it off long enough for Lang and his army of ants to gain access. Lang managed to make it into the hermetically sealed chamber that contained the Yellowjacket Suit, but at the last moment, Cross revealed his awareness of their plan and trapped Lang inside the chamber after removing the Yellowjacket suit.

Lang facing off against Darren Cross
Momentarily having the upper hand, Darren Cross' security held Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne at gunpoint while he chastised Pym for his failures as a mentor and a scientist. Cross introduced Mitchell Carson from HYDRA who intended to purchase the Yellowjacket Suit. Cross then took a gun and aimed it at Pym, intending to execute his former mentor. A scuffle broke out in which Lang was able to escape the chamber by smashing through the glass and assisted Pym and van Dyne fighting Cross' guards. Pym fought Cross but was shot in the abdomen; Lang and van Dyne ran to Pym's aid but he insisted that Lang go after Cross before he escaped.

Stopping Darren Cross
Lang holding on Cross' helicopter
Darren Cross attempted to evacuate the Pym Technologies Headquarters via private helicopter, taking hostages with him. Ant-Man pursued him and while distracted, Cross donned the Yellowjacket Suit. The two fought at both normal and shrunken sizes, with Yellowjacket's energy weapons disabling the pilots of the helicopter and sending it crashing to the ground. Lang and Cross fell from the helicopter as it was crashing, landing in an unsuspecting family's backyard pool while shrunk, only for the two of them to return to normal size and continue fighting, terrifying the family. Lang momentarily won the battle when he used a ping-pong paddle to swat Cross into a bug zapper, electrocuting him and rendering him unconscious.

Lang is escorted by Jim Paxton
Jim Paxton arrived due to the disturbance and despite Lang's attempts to explain, he was tasered by Paxton to shut him up and arrest him. Waking up in the back of the squad car, Lang attempted to explain again, but Paxton believed that Lang was simply delusional (given the Ant-Man suit made Scott look like he lost his mind and was playing dress up). At that moment, a dispatch call announced that there was a hostage situation at the address of Maggie Lang's House. Lang knew that Darren Cross had woken up and was using his daughter to get to him.

Duel at Maggie Lang's House
Lang fights Yellowjacket
Despite Jim Paxton's refusal to listen to him, Lang managed to get his helmet back on and shrink out of his handcuffs. Lang arrived and the battle between Scott and Cross continued, proving at this point to the rival father figure that he was morally sound. Lang used some of the devices that Pym gave him, often missing Cross and either shrinking or enlarging random items, such as enlarging an ant to the size of a dog, or a Thomas the Tank Engine toy to the size of a real locomotive.

Lang kills Yellowjacket
Eventually, Lang had the same revelation that Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne had decades earlier when he failed to access the internals of Cross' suit, which Cross defiantly gloats is due to its titanium construction. Lang accepted that his fate would be like Janet's and disabled the regulator on his suit, shrinking small enough to pass through the atomic structure of the titanium and into Cross' suit. Lang then permanently disabled the Yellowjacket and caused Cross to vanish into thin air.

Quantum Realm
Lang becomes trapped in the Quantum Realm
While he had succeeded in disabling the Yellowjacket Suit and also stopping Darren Cross' plans, Ant-Man discovered that he continued to shrink at various intervals, just as Hank Pym had hypothesized. Shrinking well into the subatomic world, witnessing an existence that was perceptually very strange from our own. As he traveled deeper and deeper inside the Quantum Realm where all time and space was eternal seemingly inescapable, Ant-Man began desperately searching for a way to return home rather than be trapped within there forever.

Lang is reunited with Cassie Lang
A terrified Cassie cried out for him, with her voicing booming in the Quantum Realm. Being shaken back to his senses by this, Lang quickly thought of a way to return; he placed one of the Pym Particles Disks into the regulator of his Ant-Man Suit. Activating the growth function, Lang instantly returned to the normal world and reunited with his Cassie, with Jim Paxton expressing his own gratitude for saving them both. Knowing that he would be arrested if discovered, Lang promptly shrunk out of sight when the police then showed up, using a lamp to enlarge his shadow, Lang saluted goodbye to her and headed off to return to Hank Pym.

Heist Aftermath
Lang and Pym discuss the Quantum Realm
Following the events, Jim Paxton dropped the case against Lang. When questioned by Hank Pym about his experience in the Quantum Realm, Lang could not recall anything. Pym guessed that the human mind can only handle so much out of the normal. Hope van Dyne escorted him outside Pym's sitting room, leaving him to briefly contemplate that Janet van Dyne may still be alive.
