<html><p>Davos was able to grab Rand by the throat and pushed him against the railings, furiously telling Rand that he had always been weak and insisting that without Kung's help, Rand would have never won the Duel of K'un-Lun. While Rand insisted that this was not true, Davos noted that once Rand got the power of the Iron Fist, he had run away to his money in New York, commenting that when he had come to take him home, Davos had also witnessed Rand's cowardice during the Duel at Bethesda Terrace when Rand had refused to land the final killing blow against the mortally wounded and defeated Bakuto.

Davos has a brief fight against Danny Rand
As Davos then compared Wing to a Hand whore, Rand refused to allow him to continue speaking as he pushed Davos away from him and proved himself to be the superior fighter as he swiftly subdued Davos and threw him down to the ground, warning Davos that if he dared to speak about Wing like that ever again, then he would break him while the irritated Davos had got back onto his feet. Davos then questioned if Rand would change what had happened if he could, to which Rand had insisted that there was no going back since he won the right to fight Shou-Lao and now the Iron Fist was his to wield.

Davos making his final offer to Danny Rand
When Davos commented that his victory was still debatable, Rand pointed to the Mark of Shou-Lao, however, Davos hinted that there was a way to give all the power of the Iron Fist back over to him, and questioned if Rand would be willing to hand it over to him. Although Rand insisted that the Iron Fist gave him a purpose in life, Davos had noted that he did not actually know what it was or how to use it, but still, Rand refused to hand it over to Davos. Rand invited Davos to ask his questions, but Davos had simply noted that Rand had already answered everything he wanted to ask and then he walked away.

Hatred Intensifies
Davos returning to Joy Meachum's Apartment
Angered by the failed meeting with his former friend, Davos had then met with Joy Meachum back at her Apartment where he sat down and then informed her that he had just gone to speak with Danny Rand. Meachum was initially worried that Davos had gone too far but he noted that despite having the opportunity to break his neck, he had still allowed Rand to live while Meachum had then questioned why Davos would risk everything they had been working for in order to speak with Rand face to face.

Davos telling Joy Meachum what happened
Davos explained that he had wanted to give Rand the opportunity to hand over the Iron Fist to him of his own free will, only to be rejected as Davos claimed that this was done out of mercy. Davos also noted how Meachum had given herself the chance to speak with Rand face to face along with Ward Meachum, as Davos noted that he felt he needed to speak with Rand himself, claiming that Rand's pompous and conciliatory tone had made Davos remember how much Rand had twisted their shared history together to create his own narrative where he destroyed the Hand and seemingly became a hero.

Davos expressing his hatred of Danny Rand
Agreeing with what was being said to her, Meachum then compared Davos' experiences to Rand as well as her own brother having lied to her about Harold Meachum's survival, where they had both lied and manipulated her for decades. Meachum noted that the moment Rand had returned to New York City and come back into her life, he had destroyed everything she had held dear, from her family to her work within Rand Enterprises. Meachum told Davos that she wanted Rand to experience what this was like, as Davos then promised her that he would learn as Davos would personally teach him his suffering.

Finding the Singing Bowl
Davos attending a party with Joy Meachum
In their attempt to locate a Tibetan Singing Bowl which they would need for their ritual to transfer all the power of the Iron Fist away from Danny Rand and into Davos, Joy Meachum held her party with an antique collected, Mika Prada in which Davos attended. Not enjoying parties, Davos had chosen not to join Meachum while she spoke with Prada, ignoring offers of champagne as the party continued while being aware that he had become the topic of Meachum and Prada's current conversation as Prada had taken a sexual interest in the mysterious Davos.

Davos is first introduced to Ward Meachum
Although Prada had attempted to make flirtatious small talk with him, Davos noticed that Ward Meachum was speaking with his sister and went over to make sure that everything was okay. While Ward was still considerably angry about all information which Meachum had learned from Mary Walker about him, Meachum told him to be nice and greet Davos, which Ward did mockingly and claiming that he gave their relationship no more than a week. Davos then informed Meachum that Prada was ready to show them the bowl and he and Meachum then walked away from Ward who remained annoyed.

Davos being shown the bowl by Mika Prada
Prada then had shown Davos and Meachum all the items from the collection of Ernst Erskine, including the bowl which they required. When Davos tried to take the bowl, Prada insisted that he could not touch it as it was too valuable. Davos then demanded the bowl as it was, to which Prada claimed that it was yet to be priced but insisted that it was outside his price range. Meachum then asked if she would be able to afford to buy the bowl herself, claiming that it spoke to her, to which Prada claimed that she could speak to her partners about selling it as it would be coming up for auction within three months, to which Davos had simply insisted that he needed it immediately.

Davos demanding the Tibetan Singing Bowl
With Prada still refusing to hand over the bowl to them, Davos had briefly considered using a nearby blade to kill her, but Meachum had demanded that he not. Davos, however, insisted that their plan to take all Rand's power away from him would not work if they did not have the bowl, to which Meachum had promised she would handle Prada and ensure they got the bowl by the end of the night. When Prada asked what they would like to see next, Meachum suggested that they return to the party and continue drinking, while Davos had remained sober and waited for Meachum to make her move.

Sexual Sacrifice
Davos staying sober while the women drink
Eventually, Davos joined Joy Meachum and Mika Prada as they had then returned into Meachum's Apartment, where both of the women continued drinking while Davos remained sober and uninterested in joining them as Davos sat away from the women despite being invited to sit closer to them. While Prada got up to get more alcohol, Meachum explained to Davos that Prada had recently married a congressman and would do anything to prevent a scandal from breaking out and then suggested Davos should have sex with Prada.

Davos sits with Joy Meachum and Mika Prada
Davos complained that this tactic of blackmailing Prada through sex was distasteful, to which Meachum argued that if Davos had wanted the bowl, then his code of honor had to be put aside in favor of his mission, claiming that it was only sex and not torture. Before long, Prada returned with more drinks as she questioned if Davos really hated the experience of being with them so much, as Meachum had then softly touched Davos' leg of claimed that this was not the case, before stepping outside in order to leave Davos and Prada alone as Prada gently touched Davos' skin in her attempt to seduce him.

Davos having dangerous sex with Mika Prada
Although Davos had attempted to stop Prada from touching him, she persisted, much to Davos' discomfort as he recalled the vows of the Order of the Crane Mother which he had made back in K'un-Lun to swear off women and all other pleasures of life. Although wanting to resist, Davos allowed Prada to remove his jacket and bite on his ear before unbuttoning and removing his shirt while teasing each other with a kiss. Stressed over breaking his vows, Davos grabbed Prada around the throat before they got on the couch and made passionate sex together, all while Meachum had secretly filmed everything.

Solving Problems
Assassination of Hai-Qing Yang
Davos is called to meet with Hai-Qing Yang
The next day, Davos was asked to come to Red Hook Pier where he had met with Hai-Qing Yang who had first thanked him for coming at such short notice. Questioning if his shipment from Orson Randall had arrived early which Davos hoped was the reason why he had been called there, Davos was instead given back all of the money which he had previously paid to Yang for the shipment, much to Davos' great confusion as he had then demanded an explanation.

Davos and Hai-Qing Yang discuss their deal
Yang explained that he was meeting with the Golden Tigers and his power over the Pier would be in question, and as a result, he would not be able to deliver Davos' shipment as he had promised. Deeply annoyed, Davos warned Yang that this was not the day to test him as he had just made many sacrifices, including breaking his vow to the Order of the Crane Mother by sleeping with Mika Prada the night before; however, Yang had simply argued that he was making this plan change in order to prevent the Triad War from continuing and putting any more innocent lives into harms way as a result.

Davos uses the Devil's Claw on Hai-Qing Yang
Davos questioned if all this was in order to make peace, which Yang confirmed it was. Seemingly calming down, Davos stepped towards Yang, which the Yangsi Gonshi had allowed since he did not appear threatening, and even claimed that it was an honor to know Yang. However, when Davos softly pulled Yang to him for a hug, he quietly performed Devil's Claw, a move which he had learned back in K'un-Lun and then landed three deadly blows to the pressure points on Yang's neck. With this, Davos wished Yang a good day and left, as Yang then had a stroke as a result of Davos' silent attack.

Danny Rand's Invitation
Davos returns into Joy Meachum's Apartment
As Davos returned to Joy Meachum's Apartment, Davos had passed by Sofia Rios just as she was leaving, who Meachum claimed she was looking to go into a business partnership with. Davos had then commented that while he was at K'un-Lun he had studied the tactics of Sun Tzu, Hammurabi and Khalid ibn al-Walid, making the comparison with the teachings and Meachum's way of doing business which he respected.

Davos compliments Joy Meachum's strategy
Meachum told Davos that she had plans in place for her future once their business with Danny Rand was dealt with, noting that this was actually why she had asked Davos to come over to her apartment. Meachum then explained that Rand had called her and invited her and Davos to come for dinner at Chikara Dojo with them, explaining that Rand had learned of their relationship having spoken to Ward Meachum who would have told him about how he had encountered them both while at Bailey's Auction House, as Meachum told Davos that they had to go as Rand was clearly suspicious of them.

Davos discussing dinner with Danny Rand
Although Davos expressed a desire not to go as he noted that they would soon be done with Rand for good, Meachum noted that while she had not gone to any war schools, she did still know a lot about assessing risk, claiming that it would benefit them both if they could convince Rand that they were still his friends. Davos, however, told Meachum that Rand would not suspect a thing about their secret plans for him, noting that this dinner could simply be an invitation to dinner and nothing more, although Meachum had still insisted that a dinner invitation was never actually as simple as just dinner.

Dinner at the Chikara
Davos and Meachum arrive at Chikara Dojo
Despite his objections, Davos joined Joy Meachum in traveling over to Chikara Dojo to accept the invitation to join their enemies for some dinner where they were greeted by Colleen Wing who greeted them with great enthusiasm, despite there still being clear tension between her and Davos, who shook Danny Rand's hand upon being invited in. With the mood beginning as highly tense between the three of them, Meachum had attempted to lighten the mood as she thanked Rand for the invitation and was invited to take off her coat.

Davos discuss their own strategies for dinner
While Davos helped Meachum remove her coat, he commented that it was going well, as Meachum noted the image of a strong-willed woman dating an arrogant prick was not difficult to convince them of. Meachum then commented to Wing that she remembered Chikara being a karate school when she was last there, complimenting them on the improvements and the neighborhood of Chinatown. Rand had questioned how Davos and Meachum knew each other, as Meachum explained how they had met in Paris, where Davos claimed he went on his way back from Tibet and they had struck a conversation.

Davos and Meachum tell tales of their meeting
Davos noted that he had heard a waiter call out the name Meachum and he recalled her from Harold Meachum's Penthouse where they discussed Bakuto. Meachum went on to claim that while they had grown up being world's apart, they had found that they had several common interests which had drawn them together. While Wing then awkwardly smiled and commented on what a strange universe it was to bring them together, she offered Davos and Meachum a glass of wine each before Rand asked Davos to come up onto the roof with him to help with a grill he was doing, which Davos accepted.

Davos and Danny Rand having their catch up
While they were onto the roof together, Rand commented on the last time they had seen each other, as Davos admitted that he still had a temper which was likely why their encounter had quickly resulted in the brief fight between them. Rand then recalled how Lei Kung would teach them that the best way to deal with anger was to break rocks with their bare hands, as Davos had recalled breaking his wrist while doing this to control his own anger. The pair then commented on all their shared experiences of K'un-Lun, as Rand commented that Wing often told him to put on his jacket, not realizing how much Rand had gotten used to all the cold weather due to his time at K'un-Lun.

Davos and Rand discuss the cold of K'un-Lun
As Davos noted that nobody could understand K'un-Lun without also living there themselves, Rand had also commented that Davos was now the only other person in New York City who had also previously experienced K'un-Lun and could also understand what that had been like being there, with Davos noting that in this way they were similar. Changing their subject, Davos asked what they were cooking on the grill, to which Rand explained that they were meatballs for the pasta, as Davos had questioned if this was really how these were prepared, while Rand smiled, noting that this was how he prepared them.

Tensions Boil Over
Davos and the others sitting down for dinner
As they sat down to eat dinner together, Danny Rand commented on how nice it was to have them both over as they rose a glass to their reunion. Colleen Wing then turned to Davos and asked about how his adjustment to moving to New York City from K'un-Lun had been, to which Davos claimed that he looked at any adversity as a welcome challenge, with Rand also questioning what Davos had been doing with his spare time, as Davos claimed he was exploring opportunities as they arose.

Davos is questioned on his return to New York
As the tension on the table remained highly awkward, Wing had then turned to Joy Meachum and had asked what she had been up to, to which Meachum refused to talk about her recent dealings in front of the man who ran Rand Enterprises, which did not help the awkward tension. Breaking all the silence, Meachum looked around the newly decorated Chikara Dojo and then questioned if turning the Dojo into an apartment meant Wing was no longer teaching martial arts, which she confirmed while Davos commented that maybe she was for the best, as Wing questioned what Davos meant by this comment.

Davos insultingly comments on Colleen Wing
Having been confronted, Davos commented that a teacher should lead by example, as he pointed to Wing's Katana and recalled how she had been given a moment of truth when she had stood over the wounded Bakuto and refused to kill him, as Davos claimed this was Wing walking away from that test of her character. Clearly annoyed, Wing attempted to confront Davos as Rand interrupted and tried to explain how Wing was working at Bayard Community Center, which only annoyed Wing more as she questioned what their real intentions were in coming, as Meachum questioned what she meant.

Davos attempting to calm himself back down
With Wing continuing to confront everyone on refusing to admit what they were really thinking, Davos became annoyed at her insults as he picked up his fork and considering attacking Wing with it. As Wing noted how important Davos and Meachum were to Rand, she told them to finally talk honestly and get their frustrations out once and for all. Wing noted how Davos believed Rand stole the Iron Fist from him while Rand believed that he won it fairly by defeating Davos at the Duel of K'un-Lun, but Davos refused to have this discussion and instead stepped into the bathroom to cool down his temper.

Davos finds all of Mary Walker's photographes
While Davos was in the bathroom and looking over his reflection into the mirror, Meachum was invited to speak her mind as she explained she had an issue with everything that had happened to her life since Rand had returned to New York City from K'un-Lun, pointing to how Rand and Ward Meachum and secretly known that Harold Meachum was still alive and kept that secret from her. Once Davos had calmed himself down, he stepped over to the desk and saw the photographs that Mary Walker had taken of Rand, which he had gotten his hands on, which Davos feared put their plans at his of being exposed.

Davos and Joy Meachum leave Chikara Dojo
Having seen that Rand and Wing were now in possession of all the photographs they had paid Walker to take for them, Davos returned to the dinner table and then informed Meachum that they should go immediately. Although Rand tried to convince them to stay by noting that it was him and Ward who had decided to have them both over for dinner, although Ward had failed to turn up which only angered Meachum further as she agreed to then leave the Dojo with Davos, furious that Rand had continued to lie to her. Once they were on the streets of Chinatown, Davos explained how he had found Walker's photographs as they left to investigate how this happened.

Confronting Mary Walker
Davos and Joy Meachum finding Mary Walker
Arriving at Mary Walker's Apartment, Davos had immediately entered alongside Joy Meachum, where they found Walker sat on her desk while listening to white noise. As Walker removed her headphones and engaged them, Davos then explained how they had found the photographs of Danny Rand and Colleen Wing which she had taken in the possession of Rand himself, as they questioned how this happened, with Meachum noting this likely meant that Walker's cover had been blown.

Davos' life being threatened by Mary Walker
Although Walker had assured them that everything would be alright, Davos remained unconvinced by her promises and they demanded answers, although Walker had requested that instead, they leave her apartment. When Davos threatened Walker by noting that he would make her tell him the truth, she drew her Twin Machetes and held them to Davos' throat, much to Meachum's horror who attempted to calm the situation. Davos, however, had still remained unintimidated by Walker's threats, once again questioning how Rand had gotten his hands on the photographs, smashing his fist down on the table until Walker had finally agreed to tell them everything she knew.

Davos demanding answers from Mary Walker
Over the next few hours, Davos and Meachum continued questioning Walker over how Rand had gotten the photographs, as Walker still assured them both that she did not give Rand the photographs but promised that it was not something they had to worry about, which Davos claimed was both a paradox and a contradiction. Becoming considerably annoyed by all Walker's statements, Davos got into her face and demanded the truth, but Walker threatened that if Davos touched her, then he would lose his hand. Meachum then threatened to not pay Walker her money if she did not tell them the truth.

Davos leaves Joy Meachum with Mary Walker
With Davos demanding to know who gave Rand those photographs, Walker explained how she was asking them to put blind trust in her, before commenting on how she had spent months tracking Rand, to the point that she knew how he ate, slept, fought and how not many people could handle his Iron Fist. Getting up, Davos told Meachum he had to go collect the Tibetan Singing Bowl and recruit the Crane Sisters, leaving Meachum to deal with Walker as Davos reminded her of how dangerous Walker was, while Meachum noted how if Walker wanted a fight then she and Davos would already be fighting.

Collecting the Corpse
Davos making his return into Red Hook Pier
With limited time to complete his plans, Davos returned to Red Hook Pier where the container which Davos had previously arranged to have delivered by Hai-Qing Yang was being kept. Entering into the building, Davos had soon discovered that it had been taken over by the Golden Tigers who were now standing guard and stealing from all the containers, which had forced Davos to hide as best he could to avoid raising the alarm.

Davos killing a guard without raising the alarm
Sneaking up behind one of the guards, Davos silently got behind him and put him in a chock hold before calmly breaking his neck. Making his way through the containers, Davos kept out of sight of the guards while using the training of the Order of the Crane Mother to ensure he remained calm and prepared for battle. Coming across three more members of the Golden Tigers, Davos stepped out and claimed that he had come for what was his, as the men drew their knives and told him that he could not there, also explaining that everything there now belonged to the Golden Tigers and demanded that he leave.

Davos brutally slaughtering the Golden Tigers
Remaining calm, Davos had allowed the first member of the Golden Tigers to get close to him while threatening him with a blade, before Davos was able to disarm him and used his own blade to cut the man's throat. Before the other guards could even react to what had happened in front of them, Davos furiously threw the blade directly into another's stomach before charging forward to disable the other man with a punch to the throat as he proceeded to rip the blade out of the second man's stomach and had finally stabbed the third man directly into the heart, killing all three in a matter of seconds.

Davos collects the corpse of a former Iron Fist
With all the guards now dead, Davos calmly threw one of the blades away before stepping to his container from Hancock Transport, as he stepped inside and had found a large crate inside waiting for him, as Davos then cut it free of ropes and finally opened up the crate which contained the corpse of a previous Iron Fist. Overlooking the body of the past warrior of K'un-Lun, Davos still paid his respects to his fallen brother before opening his shirt to see the Mark of Shou-Lao on the corpse's chest, as Davos proceeded to cut the Mark off his chest as he departed the building with it, leaving the corpse behind.

Immortal Iron Fist
Stealing Iron Fist's Power
Davos prepares for the transference ceremony
Having finally gained everything that he had required to complete his long-held desire for power, Davos meditated while the Crane Sisters had prepared for the upcoming ceremony behind him. As they handed Davos a hot drink to calm his mind and body, the Crane Sisters had then laid Davos down flat on his stomach, awaiting the next step to become the Iron Fist and prove himself as a warrior who was worthy of K'un-Lun, which Davos had always desired to become.

Davos being tattooed by the Crane Sisters
Completing Davos' plan, Mary Walker also managed to successfully capture Danny Rand who was tied up in Eden Towers, having been drugged during his encounter with Walker. Rand was then handed over to Davos to then finally take all his power away from him, which Davos believed Rand was unworthy of. Davos had the Crane Sisters slice Rand down his side, causing Rand great pain before using his blood mixed up with the melted down Mark of Shou-Lao which was gained from the previous Iron Fist, to make a Steel Serpent tattoo on Davos' back, using Ceremonial Needles to complete the tattoo.

Davos stealing the power from Danny Rand
Having made the tattoo using the Tibetan Singing Bowl to mix all the contents together, as the combination of this being printed onto his skin would soon allow Davos to complete the ceremony, Davos had remained still, ignoring the pain of the tattoo being stabbed into his skin, making the traditional mark from K'un-Lun of the Steel Serpent. With the tattoo now finally completed, Davos stepped to the drugged Rand and told him that now Rand would give him what had always been his. Davos had then performed the ceremony, placing his hand to Rand's forehead and violently ripping the Iron Fist directly out from his body, which had then left Rand completely powerless.

Davos obtaining the power of the Iron Fist
While Walker was tasked with removing the injured Rand and taking him back to New York City, Davos had put on a traditional face mask from K'un-Lun and proved their ceremony was a success, punching at a concrete wall using the power of Chi, completely obliterating it with his red Iron Fist, roaring at the top of his voice as he landed the impossibly powerful strike. Taking a moment to consider his success, Davos removed his mask and remembered K'un-Lun, thinking back to his former friendship with Rand when they had been children, both with their own ambitions to become the Immortal Iron Fist.

Davos saving a man from the Golden Tigers
While honored that he had completed his mission, Davos had also thought of Priya, wishing that his mother had been alive to see him become the Iron Fist as she had been disappointed that he had lost the Duel of K'un-Lun. However, as Davos was celebrating his victory, he overheard several members of the Golden Tigers threatening a factory owner nearby, as they shot at the man and threatening to break his bones. Seeking to use his newly gained power to do some good, Davos went to the factory owner's aid, furiously attacking the Golden Tigers and killing them and saving the factory owner.

Davos explaining he is the Immortal Iron Fist
With those members of the Golden Tigers dead, the factory owner begged for his life by promising that he would not tell anybody what had happened, although Davos insisted that the man had nothing to fear from him, claiming that he had come to protect him. Once Davos had confirmed who the men were, he questioned where he could find more members of the Golden Tigers, as the factory owner explained about the Nightclub where Ho and other members could be found. As he left to slaughter his enemies, Davos was asked who he was, to which he simply answered that he was the Immortal Iron Fist.

Attack on Golden Tigers
Davos arrives into a Nightclub to confront Ho
Arriving at the Golden Tigers' Nightclub, Davos made his way past all of those in attendance, ignoring all of the extremely loud music that was playing and instead focusing only on his mission to destroy members of the Triads. When Davos' path was being blocked by one guard, he simply broke the man's wrist and then subdued him before continuing to make his way towards his target, subduing one other guard before he had stopped to overlook the Nightclub and had then found exactly who he was looking for.

Davos fighting against all Ho's bodyguards
Taking out several more guards who he threw into tables and down the stairs, Davos walked over to Ho, who was enjoying the company of several women who ran for safety along with the other guests to get away from Davos. Ho mistakenly thought Davos' public fight was his audition to become part of the Golden Tigers, telling him that he was impressed and offered him a drink, only for Davos to explain that he had come there to tell him that the Triad War was now over as he would personally end it, which Ho just merely scoffed at, as he had calmly called over more of his guards to take out Davos.

Davos murdering Ho with his powerful punch
As Ho's men then drew their blades and attempted to cut him down, Davos calmly defended himself and slaughtered all the men without breaking a sweat, causing Ho to finish his drink and step up to Davos personally. With his blade still in his belt, Ho had then confidently prepared himself to fight Davos himself; however, just as Ho drew his blade, Davos used his Chi power to light up and Iron Fist and strike Ho directly in the chest. The force of the blow from the Iron Fist had caused Ho to be launched across the Nightclub as his lifeless body smashed into the wall as the impact fatally crushed his ribcage.

Davos recruits the assistance of Chen Wu
With Ho now lying dead at his feet, Davos had then stepped over to the last remaining man, Chen Wu, who instead of attempting to fight against Davos, promised that if he wanted to destroy the Triads, then he could help him by showing Davos where they could all be found, promising he would take Davos there himself. As Davos explained he wanted to destroy all criminals in New York City, he then got a text message from Joy Meachum, asking him to meet her. Preparing to meet Meachum, Davos told Wu to meet him with a list of targets and warned Wu against even considering going against him.

Grasping his Destiny
Davos waiting to speak with Joy Meachum
Davos arrived at Joy Meachum's Apartment before she did, greeting Meachum upon her arrival, while the clearly annoyed Meachum then commented on how Davos had already made himself at home in her apartment. Meachum explained that Mary Walker had come by and shown her the video of Danny Rand being tortured and then thrown out onto the streets of New York City once his power had been taken away and given to Davos, with Davos questioning if the video was everything that Meachum had hoped that it would be.

Davos and Meachum discuss their next move
Meachum had noted that now their mission together was completed, they should discuss the next part of their plan as Meachum claimed that they should no longer be seen together, requesting that Davos give her back her key. Davos, however, had noted that while they had completed what they had agreed to go back in Paris by taking away everything that had made Rand feel alive, however he had noted that while Meachum might feel that she was done with everything, he had only just begun, questioning if Meachum had believed that taking the Iron Fist would be the end for them, which Meachum confirmed.

Davos gives Joy Meachum one final warning
Davos told Meachum that he had not simply taken the Iron Fist away from Rand, but he had become the very thing that Rand never had the strength to be, allowing him to finally fulfill his destiny. Although Meachum tried to dismiss Davos' claims of grandeur by commenting that it simply made his fist light up, Davos told her that the Iron Fist was not a weapon to merely be held, but it was to be used against his enemies and the enemies of K'un-Lun, vowing to do what Rand had always been unable to do, and end the Triad War once and for all by slaughtering all those involved, which had scared Meachum.

Davos thinking back to him leaving K'un-Lun
As Meachum insisted that whatever Davos was planning could not be linked to her, Davos told her that she could not pretend that nothing had ever happened. Davos told Meachum that he was now the Iron Fist, explaining how important this was to the Order of the Crane Mother, offering for her to join him. As Meachum hesitated at this, Davos warned that every decision would have consequences before walking out. On his way out the building, Davos recalled his final conversation with Priya before leaving for New York City, where his mother had failed to even say her final goodbye to him.

Slaughtering the Triads
Davos goes onto his missions with Chen Wu
As requested, Chen Wu had met with Davos with his long list of the locations of various Triad members across New York City. Davos had Wu personally drive him to all of these locations where Davos would go inside and slaughter the Triad members inside with the power of the Iron Fist. As Davos stepped out of another building, wiping the blood from his fists, Wu tried to find out how it had gone, only for Davos to ignore him and instead simply walked to the car and asked where they were going next.

Davos and Chen Wu discussing their targets
Wu suggested that they should go get some food together, as Davos informed him that he did not eat meat and insisted that they instead travel to their next target, which had annoyed Wu. Davos was driven to a garage where he saw several men playing cards, as Wu claimed it was connected with the Yangsi Gonshi, explaining how they would steal cars and sold them for parts. As Wu noted that the men inside also sold Oxycontin, he had questioned if Davos even knew anything about their ongoing Opioid Epidemic, only for Davos to insist that he did not care about details, only that these men were criminals.

Davos sees Ryhno's Gang as they watch him
Stepping out of the car, Davos had prepared to slaughter the Yangsi Gonshi, only to catch sight of Ryhno's Gang watching him from the side. Davos, however, chose to ignore Ryhno and his people, instead stepping inside of the Yangsi Gonshi's hideout and attacking that inside, as Wu turned up his car radio and watched while Davos used the Iron Fist to kill everyone inside before calmly walking out, wiping the blood from his fist. As Wu drove him away from the crime scene, Davos saw BB and Hex then taking advantage of the newly created situation to run inside the hideout and steal whatever money and or supplies that they could find there, which Davos chose to allow.

Davos is taken into Eden Towers by Chen Wu
Following an entire evening of driving around New York City and then killing members of the Golden Tigers and Yangsi Gonshi, Davos was driven back to Eden Towers by Wu. While looking over the building, Wu suggested that he could take Davos to a nice hotel but Davos refused, insisting that the Towers suited him just fine, claiming that it reminding him of K'un-Lun, although he still refused to tell Wu about it. Stepping out of the car, Davos told Wu to meet him back there the next day, explaining that this was merely the first day and there was much that still needed to be done to complete his mission.

Davos and Chen Wu discuss Ryhno's Gang
However, before Davos stepped inside the Towers, he had returned to Wu's car and tapped on the window. Davos questioned Wu about Ryhno's Gang who he had seen outside the Yangsi Gonshi, as Wu claimed that those kids were just vultures looking to steal whatever they could, noting that he knew where their Hideout could be found. As Davos confirmed that they did not have families, Wu questioned if he wanted them to be added to the list, however Davos told him not to, wishing to see if they all had potential to join him instead of being slaughtered by him like the Golden Tigers and Yangsi Gonshi.

Attacked by Rand and Walker
Davos discovers Danny Rand waiting for him
As Davos had stepped inside Eden Towers, he was greeted by Danny Rand who Davos calmly called his brother and noted that he had not expected to find him there. Rand questioned what Davos had been doing, to which Davos had then claimed that he had simply been doing the work of the Iron Fist in defeating his enemies and bringing peace to innocent lives in need, although Rand had pointed out that Davos still had some dried blood on his face, noting how Davos had been going all around New York City and murdering people.

Davos discusses all Danny Rand's mistakes
Davos however simply defended his actions, comparing his killings to putting a feral dog to sleep or curing a virus of a body, claiming that what he had been doing to the Yangsi Gonshi and Golden Tigers was not murder but justice. Davos went on to claim that Rand should be thanking him for freeing him of the responsibility of being the Iron Fist, which he had believed had become a burden for Rand. However Rand claimed that Davos spat in the face of tradition by not earning the power by winning the Duel of K'un-Lun and then defeating Shou-Lao, but by kidnapping him and stealing the power from him.

Davos defending all of his own recent murders
Angered by this, Davos noted that in abandoning K'un-Lun Rand had lost any right to speak about any other traditions. Davos then calmly walked around Rand, noting how due to his own wealthy upbringing within Rand Enterprises, he had grown up selfish, without a culture to honor and protect as Davos had. Rand, however, interrupted Davos and told him to stop justifying all his actions, noting that while Davos still believed he knew what he was doing, the New York City Police Department would not understand and would not hesitate and shoot him down, then offering Davos the chance to hand himself in.

Davos however merely scoffed at Rand's suggestion, telling him that he knew what the risks were and claimed that this was simply what commitment to a cause looked like. Davos claimed that while Rand had said he was protecting New York, he had never had the strength of character to walk the hard line. Davos insisted that he had ended the Triad War in a single day, but Rand told him he had just become another faction, claiming Davos had disgraced what Lei Kung had taught them, to which Davos claimed that Kung had misled them and even vowed that he was willing to crush his own father's heart.

Davos' Iron Fist is caught by Mary Walker
Davos told Rand that he was not angry and that he wanted Rand by his side in the upcoming conflict, admitting that he knew that Rand would not forgive him soon but noting he was willing to wait until he came around, claiming he was a paragon of virtue with a righteous cause. Before Davos could continue, Mary Walker then stepped out of the shadows and attacked him, furiously striking Davos across the face before tying up his hand with her trick wire. When Davos lit up the Iron Fist and strike back, Walker avoided the blow and flipped up over him, before injecting him in the back with a tranquilizer.

Davos furiously using his second Iron Fist
Although Davos had been pinned down and was unable to use his right arm, he instead lit up his other Iron Fist, much to the horror of Rand who had always been unable to do this. Before Rand or Walker could do anything to stop him, Davos then roared out and just all his might and smash his fist onto the ground, creating a shockwave that threw both Rand and Walker away from him. Davos then ripped the tranquilizer out of his back, only for Rand to attack him and push it back into his chest, while Davos still managed to defend himself and proceeded to punch Rand hard in the chest to knock him away.

Davos strikes and breaks Danny Rand's knee
Fueled by rage, Davos was able to subdue Walker before grabbing Rand and telling him that he had crossed a line, before throwing him down on his back. Although Davos was victorious and stood over his injured enemies, the effects from Walker's tranquilizer began to take hold, as Davos began struggling to walk or even remain on his feet. Stepping over to Rand, Davos knew he had to ensure that Rand did not try and ambush him again, lighting up the Iron Fist and striking Rand directly on the kneecap, shattering the bone and causing Rand considerable pain. With this done, Davos finally collapsed.

Recruiting Ryhno's Gang
Davos watches Chen Wu fight Ryhno's Gang
Continuing their mission, Davos and Chen Wu together then traveled to the Hideout of Ryhno's Gang, where Davos had begun using the power of the Iron Fist to punch holes through all the walls. Eventually, they were interrupted by the arrival of the gang themselves, who demanded to know what was going on, as Wu told them to back off. As Davos watched on from the side, Wiz and other members of the gang attempted to subdue Wu, only to be swiftly defeated.

Davos demonstrates the power of the Iron Fist
Although Wu came out on top as the superior fighter, Ryhno himself then pulled his shotgun and threatened to execute Wu. Seeing this, Davos then made his presence known as he used the Iron Fist and completely obliterate the doorway, causing Ryhno to drop his gun in shock at Davos' display of power. Davos informed Ryhno and all his gang that he was not there to hurt them, but to free them as BB then asked Davos how he had gained such a powerful hit, as Davos had explained that he had trained his entire life at K'un-Lun to gain those abilities, questioning if they had ever had such a strong ambition.

Davos personally greeting all Ryhno's Gang
Davos noted how while he had been slaughtering the Golden Tigers and Yangsi Gonshi, Ryhno and his gang had been there to scavenge the remains, questioning if this was really how they wanted the world to see them. As Davos told the gang that he was offering them an opportunity, noting how New York City had failed them, BB mocked the idea. Davos then stepped up to BB and had noted how the gang lived on the fringes of society, suggesting that all the effort it took to survive could be directed onto a noble purpose, as Davos told them that he could then train them all to be warriors, promising that if they came into Eden Towers he would teach them to fight with him.

Davos makes his suggestion to Ryhno's Gang
Having now gotten all their attention, Davos promised Ryhno's Gang that with his help, they could turn their own lives around and do good for New York by joining him. Ryhno questioned if Davos was being serious, which he had promised that he was, telling them to come to Eden Towers where they would be given food and a place to stay while Davos trained them in martial arts. Davos told the group that he would work them hard, but he would ensure that they were better for the hardship, asking them to trust him before he walked away, as BB had then commented on what a strange dude Davos was.

Confronting Street Thugs
Davos brutally strangles yet another criminal
Davos then continued his mission to end the Triad War, finding more criminals who he furiously killed, putting one man into his headlock, breaking his leg, smashing his head hard into the wall until he had chocked him to death, punching him in the skull for extra measure. Stepping outside, Davos was given a cloth from Chen Wu to wipe his bloody fists, as Wu asked when he wanted to attack the Yangsi Gonshi's massage parlor, as Davos insisted they would target that the following day.

Davos and Chen Wu discuss their missions
Davos had told Wu that they would need to prepare for the upcoming arrival of Ryhno's Gang at Eden Towers where he would begin their training, although Wu then expressed his distaste for the gang and compared them to street rats who were not worthy of training under them. Davos, however, noted that Danny Rand would likely attack him again, claiming that anybody who ever held the Iron Fist would stop at nothing to get it back and so he needed warriors beside him. Wu noted that he could fight, to which Davos said that Wu was just one man, as Wu suggested Ryhno's Gang were all expendable.

Davos murdering Nines Hat with the Iron Fist
Just as Davos was commenting on his need for more warriors as he claimed New York City was cancer that he still could not burn out alone, he overheard some thugs attempting to steal a car down the street. Confronting the thugs, Davos then smashed one man's head against the door before Nines Hat stepped up to him and tried to threaten Davos. Seeing that he would not move, Davos struck him with the Iron Fist, launching him backward and killing him instantly, before turning to Leather Coat, who desperately tried to reason with Davos, who claimed the thug was a poison much like the city.

Davos crushing the throat of Leather Coat
As Davos furiously threw Leather Coat onto the hood of the car, Wu stepped in and tried to argue that these men were merely low-level criminals and not members of the Golden Tigers or Yangsi Gonshi or any other Triad, to which Davos threatened to kill Wu as well if he had dared speak against him. Striking the thug across the face, Davos pressed his foot onto the thug's throat, pressing down as he looked at Wu and informed him that he was simply speeding up the process of cleaning New York of criminal scum who lived there, before finally crushing the thug's throat, much to the utter disgust of Wu.

Reunion with Meachum
Davos being interrupted by Joy Meachum
While he was training in Eden Towers, Davos was then visited by Joy Meachum who commented that this was exactly how she imagined him living, while Davos claimed that he needed nothing but the bare essentials. Davos expressed his great surprise at seeing Meachum again, noting that he had been disappointed by their last meeting, as Meachum discussed what her plans were before claiming that while nothing about her plans was real, what they had done to Danny Rand was real and that it had meant something important.

Davos and Meachum discussing their actions
Meachum explained how she had changed the locks on her door as she had been afraid of what Davos could be capable of, although Davos insisted that he did not want to hurt her, reminding her of the potential that he had always seen in her. Meachum, however, claimed that she was more afraid of letting go than she was of Davos, noting that she would no longer ignore the fact that fate had brought them together for a reason, claiming that what they did to Rand might not have been enough. Meachum noted that she heard how Davos broke Rand's leg, as Davos had insisted that he was left with no choice.

Davos vowing to keep Joy Meachum safe
Davos told Meachum how his plans went far beyond revenge, but building a future society which he could be proud of, as Meachum came onboard and noted that first Davos should focus on improving himself. Davos expressed his delight at Meachum's return, noting how he had missed her company and admitting that while he could be overly serious, he promised that Meachum had nothing to fear from him, promising to be her protector and her friend. While Davos tried to show Meachum around, she mentioned Mika Prada and had asked about the Tibetan Singing Bowl, questioning where it was.

Davos personally welcoming Ryhno's Gang
While Davos would only say that the bowl was being kept close by, he was interrupted by the arrival of Ryhno's Gang who he welcomed. Upon arriving, Ryhno asked how Davos used the Iron Fist, which he claimed could not be explained quickly, while he also told the group that his new focus was not on bring destruction with the Iron Fist, but instead with bringing about change for good, which Ryhno accepted. BB asked Davos what his name was, as Davos introduced himself as the Immortal Iron Fist, while also insisting that BB and the Gang refer to him as Shifu, which BB and the rest of the Gang accepted.

Davos teaching Ryhno's Gang how to fight
Over the next few weeks, Davos trained up Ryhno's Gang to become warriors, using the skills he had learned with the Order of the Crane Mother to teach all his students how to strike with deadly precision against their enemies in battle, reciting the lessons that he had been taught by Lei Kung back at K'un-Lun. During the lessons, Davos had shown off his own skills by putting his students in chock holds that they then could not escape from, before ordering them to continue with their practicing, all to prepare them for the day that Rand would return and attempted to steal the Iron Fist back from Davos.

Losing Control
Attack on Sherry Yang
Davos is driven into Sherry Yang's location
Seeking to continue his mission to destroy the Yangsi Gonshi, Davos was driven to the apartment of James Wong where they had learned that Sherry Yang had been hiding out. While they were both still sat waiting just outside the building Chen Wu asked for the opportunity to assist in killing Yang, to which Davos then noted that while Wu had helped him to destroy dozens of his enemies within the Yangsi Gonshi, he had also betrayed dozens of his former allies with the Golden Tigers, as Davos claimed that he would never trust Wu.
