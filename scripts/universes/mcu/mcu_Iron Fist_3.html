<html><p>As they looked around the Penthouse which Jeri Hogarth provided for him, Rand compared it to his room at K'un-Lun, describing his room back there and how he was only provided with a small pot to urinate in, which disgusted Joy. Rand explained how he spent every moment of his life in K'un-Lun training and fighting while under the leadership of Lei Kung in order to become the Iron Fist. Joy claimed that the training ritual and beatings sounded like abuse, but Rand dismissed this with simply a smile. While Rand went to make another drink, Joy went to open the door when someone had knocked.

Rand saves Joy Meachum from Triad thugs
While he was preparing to make up the drink for Joy, Rand was then suddenly alerted when he heard Joy screaming out for help and had immediately run out to help, as out in the hallway of his apartment, Rand saw Joy being dragged away by thugs wielding hatchets. Rand immediately subdued two attackers who charged at him with great ease, before one of the attackers hit Joy in the face while the others drew their hatchets and prepared to kill Rand. Preparing himself for the fight, Rand calmed his Chi and got into a fighting pose, eyeing up his new enemies as he prepared to take them all on himself.

Rand fights the Triad Thugs inside the elevator
Using his fighting skills, Rand took on all four of his initial attackers who furiously slashed at him with their hatchets, as Rand was able to dodge the deadly blows while landing strong counter strikes against them, only taking one single kick to the chest while he subdued the attackers with considerable ease. With the men unable to react fast enough to Rand's fighting styles, Rand soon came out as the victor, however, the elevator finally opened, allowing Joy's kidnappers to drag her inside, while another man threw his hatchet at Rand, which he dodged before subduing him with a kick to the kneecap.

Rand pulling Joy Meachum away to safety
Determined not to allow the men to get away, Rand managed to stop the elevator doors closing, only to be forced to summon the Iron Fist on one occasion to break a hatchet against his skin when one of the men tried to strike his hand. The broken hatchet damaged the lights as Rand stepped inside the elevator and had managed to defeat all of the thugs with ease without injury to himself or Joy. He managed to rescue Joy as he drove the attackers away. Rand had overheard the thugs speaking in Mandarin about retreating back to the Golden Sands before they had then desperately fled away from Rand, who had then put his focus back on ensuring Meachum's safety.

Rand returns to Colleen Wing's dojo for help
Having gotten away from criminals, Rand had then headed straight over to Chikara Dojo with Joy where he found that the door was locked, as Rand asked Colleen Wing for her help with keeping the still shaken Joy safe from harm, while Wing reluctantly opened the door for him. Rand also soon noticed Wing's hand and asked what happened; however, Wing responded with the same question, noting how last time she checked Rand had been stalking Joy, joking that being a millionaire must have changed that, as Rand corrected her by noting he was now actually a billionaire.

Rand looks over the Yangsi Gonshi's hideout
Rand asked Wing to look after Joy and for information on where the Golden Sand was, which Wing claimed that she did not know until learning that the thugs wielded hatchets. Having heard this Wing had recognized them as Yangsi Gonshi, who was also the Triad criminal organization who were currently based within New York City and told Rand where to find them. Wishing to end the situation before either of the Meachums were put in danger again Rand then headed off to confront the Yangsi Gonshi personally, leaving Joy under Wing's own protection until he got back from meeting the criminals.

Meeting Yangsi Gonshi
Rand finds the Golden Sands Restaurant
Finding the Golden Sands, where Rand then went inside in order to look for the Triads. When a receptionist questioned Rand's presence as she informed him that they were currently closed, Rand explained that he was looking for Yangsi Gonshi which caused the receptionist and all the kitchen staff to freeze in place. Rand had insisted that he was not there to cause trouble as the receptionist then signaled the kitchen staff to retreat from the restaurant.

Rand making his deal with Hai-Qing Yang
With Rand now alone in the room, Hai-Qing Yang then entered the room with his goons as one of the goons told his boss that Rand was the one who bested them all. Yang and Rand introduced themselves, with Yang explaining he was the head of the Yangshi Gonshi as Rand told him he was the head of Rand Enterprises. Rand then demanded to know why Yang's men had tried to kidnap Joy Meachum. to which Yang returned the question by asking why Rand Enterprises had also stolen the Red Hook Pier away from them. Yang explained that his gang had a deal with the previous tenant and that Meachum's action broke the deal and they just wanted to have a word with her.

Rand tells Hai-Qing Yang about the Hand
Rand retorted that they wanted to force her to make a new deal, to which Yang threaten that perhaps they should use Rand to broker a new deal and had questioned if that was Rand's intent to come to his restaurant. Rand had answered that he came to warn them not to get near Joy again while Yang questioned why Rand wanted to keep the pier, as Rand answered by saying The Hand. This answer frightened Yang and he hurriedly urged Rand to send their deepest apologies to Joy. When Rand attempted to get more answers, Yang left and spoke in mandarin that he wanted them all out of Rand Enterprise.

Rand fixes Colleen Wing's dislocated finger
When Rand returned back into the Chikara Dojo, he found Joy being taught how to punch by Colleen Wing. Greeting them, Rand calmly reassured Joy that the Triads would not be a problem anymore, and when Joy questioned exactly how he managed to accomplish that, Rand explained that he simply went to talk to them. Wing asked if he meant fighting them, Rand had maintained that he simply came to an agreement with them. Rand went over help Wing fix her dislocated finger, explaining his master used to fix him back in K'un-Lun, telling her to count to three, only for Rand to fix it on the first count.

Rand promises Colleen Wing about the rent
Rand revealed that he knew about Wing's illegal fighting and that he was not judging her, revealing that he used to fight in the illegal fight clubs on his journey back to New York City. Rand told Wing that he was more than willing to fulfill his promise to Wing about paying her rent for six months, however, Wing still maintained her stance and refused to accept his money, but thanked Rand all the same for the offer. With that said, Rand and Joy left the dojo and agreed that they would not tell Ward Meachum about the encounter with the Triads as they were still unsure about how he would react to this news.

Iron Fist training in order to restore his Chi
The next day, Rand had continued to meditate and trained himself while in his Penthouse, attempting to restore his Chi so the Iron Fist would be available for his next battle. However, Rand was interrupted when someone had knocked on his front door and, when Rand went and opened the door, he found that no one was there except for a small red box. Rand look into the content, he found a message from Yang and a clue in a small paper of heroin on where he should start looking for the Hand. Rand recognized the Mark on the drug as the symbol of Shou-Lao the Undying, much to his great surprise.

Hunting the Hand
Investigating Steel Serpent
Rand learning from the heroin's properties
Rand started investigating the content of the heroin provided to him by Hai-Qing Yang of the Yangsi Gonshi, wishing to learn more about how it was being made. He then learned from a Rand scientist, Sandi Ann, that the heroin was not opium-based as Ann explained to him that every test she had gone through revealed that the content was chemical and that there was no need to harvest opium from foreign countries which in turn had made it easier to manufacture. Ann further explained that the most amazing accomplishment that nothing about the drug was actually illegal.

Rand thanking Sandi Ann for her assistance
Rand deduced that anyone can make it in a real lab, while Ann then also noted that whoever had designed the heroin, had ensured that there was no limit to how much could be made and then sold on the streets. While Ann warned him that this new heroin arriving on the streets of New York City could cause a major epidemic in the city and put many innocent lives in serious danger, to which Rand reassured her that he would deal with it personally and thanked Ann for her assistance, offering Ann a formal bow before sitting at his desk and considering how he would handle this current situation.

Rand showing Ward Meachum the new heroin
Heading straight into Ward Meachum's office, Rand then placed the heroin on Meachum's desk as Rand explained that the drugs was being shipped from Red Hook Pier. Meachum was furious that Rand had been foolish enough to bring drugs into his office while Rand explained that he needed to find out what they were dealing with and how Rand Enterprises were still inadvertently assisting them while Meachum retorted what made him think this had anything to do with them. Rand explained how he got the heroin from Hai-Qing Yang of the Yangsi Gonshi, explaining that he had dealt with them but their situation had since escalated and needed to be dealt with.

Rand explains the heroin's connection to him
Rand pointed to the symbol of Shou-Lao on the bag of heroin, telling Meachum how this connected with K'un-Lun and the Dragon which turned him into the Iron Fist. Despite Rand's explanation and the fact that the Hand was using their company to smuggle synthetic heroin into the city, Meachum refused to believe or help Rand, insisting that he still had real business in the real world which he had to deal with rather than what he assumed was all Rand's fantasy. Disappointed, Rand then left Meachum's office, while also leaving the heroin behind on his desk, much to the considerable annoyance of Meachum.

Rand asking when is the next shipment arrives
Rand went to talk to Megan as he asked her questions about her job, questioning if her job meant she was his apprentice which Megan corrected for him. Getting back to what he actually needed, Rand asked if she could tell him when the next shipment arrives to Red Hook Pier, to which Megan explained that while she could not, she instead guided Rand to the Sarah Galvin who had the information he was looking for, as Rand thanked Megan for all of her help before he then went downstairs to meet with Galvin, leaving the origami flower which he had made during their conversation on Megan's desk.

Rand promising Regina Fitzgerald for help
Outside of the Rand Enterprises Building, as Rand was reading the information that he had been given by Galvin, he was approached by Regina Fitzgerald who had said that she had heard about his recent action of lowering the drug price. She showed him a photo of her son as Rand was stunted and inquired before Fitzgerald explained that her son got cancer from the Rand Chemical Plant near where they lived. Rand was sympathetic to the mother's plight as he apologized and promised to make it right. Unknown to Rand, he was filmed by the mother's lawyer nearby to help with their legal case.

Recruiting Colleen Wing
Rand greets Claire Temple inside the dojo
Later during the day, Rand went back to Chikara Dojo where he had found Colleen Wing as she trained her student, Claire Temple. Rand greeted them and Temple recognized Rand from the news, jokingly calling his story the riches to rags to riches story as Rand noted that it had been pretty crazy for him, with Temple claiming that living in New York City for long enough can get you to the point where nothing else could surprise you anymore. Wing approached and asked if Rand needed something as Rand had then answered that he just wanted to have a talk with her.

Rand orders takeout for Colleen Wing
Wing told Rand that whatever he wanted would have to wait until she was done with her class with Temple, to which Rand awkwardly replied that he had ordered take-out much to Wing's bewilderment and Temple's amusement. Temple questioned how Rand and Temple knew each other, to which Rand noted that Wing had given him two dollars while he was living in Central Park having just arrived back in New York. After a brief talk and a formal introduction with Temple, several men walked into the dojo with tables and chairs which were all from Wendell Rand's former favorite place to eat take out.

Rand invites Claire Temple for takeout
Wing nervously asked Rand if what he was provided was actually his attempt at a date, Rand was quick to deny that it was a date, unless Wing wanted it to be, to which she denied as well as they awkwardly agreed that it was not a date. Rand explained that he needed Wing's help with something, to which Wing questioned if what he needed from her really required candlelight, which Rand struggled to answer. As their lesson had now been interrupted by Rand's delivery of food, Wing then asked Temple to join them for dinner, wanting somebody else with them to ensure that the dinner was not too awkward.

Rand sits with Colleen Wing and Claire Temple
Once the tables were set with their food, Rand spoke a brief pray to Buddha before eating with Wing and Temple. As they began eating, Temple asked about Rand's life in K'un-Lun and what they could get to eat there as Rand spoke about how he and Davos used to sneak out to eat donkey, before discussing his training and all his vows to the Order of the Crane Mother, explaining that in the wake of all the terrible horrors of his deadly Plane Crash he had simply focused on his training, putting aside all his material attachments and romantic entanglements, much to the considerable surprise of Wing.

Rand awkwardly asking for privacy
Temple asked why he waited this long to return to home from K'un-Lun, to which Rand had then explained that the way back had been closed for all those years and that he had to wait until the passage open again so he could arrive into China and begin making his way back to the United States of America. Wing had noted that Rand had mentioned that he wanted to speak to her about something, as Rand awkwardly hinted that it was something he wanted to speak to Wing alone about, as Temple eventually took the hint and left the pair alone to speak in private, taking some boxes of the takeouts with her.

Rand tells Colleen Wing about the heroin
Now alone, Wing asked why Rand had come as Rand explained that criminals were using Rand Enterprises to ship the Steel Serpent into the city. When Wing asked why Rand did not call the New York City Police Department, Rand explained that his company would then be held responsible and the criminals would just simply find another way to get their drugs in. Wing asked what he could do, Rand answered that if he could prove to Ward Meachum that it was happening, Ward will be forced to help him shut it down. Rand had explained that with the shipment coming in tonight, he could find his evidence there.

Rand asking for Colleen Wing's assistance
Rand asked for Wing's assistance, much to her disbelief as Rand kept insisting that Wing wanted this as just like him, she had trained his entire life for a threat that never arrived. Rand reasoned that if they didn't stop the shipment at Red Hook Pier then people will get hurt which includes Wing's students. When Wing asserted that she will be forced to cancel her class, Rand assured her that she would not have to worry about rent, revealing that he brought the entire building and he was now her new landlord, so Wing had then finally agreed to help and told Rand to fix the leak under her sink.

Rand observing Colleen Wing's fighting skills
As they prepared themselves for their mission, Rand had soon found Wing's own Katana as he began practicing with it until Wing arrived and insulted his style. Wing demonstrated her own style by slashing at Rand, as he commented that she had great skill with the sword. Both Rand and Wing had then enthusiastically demonstrated their own skills with Nunchaku as Rand happily commented that Wing was amazing. As Rand checked his phone, he realized that the company had recently been calling him for several hours, but he still chose to focus on the mission rather than calling the company back.

Saving the Chemist
Rand and Colleen Wing reached to the pier
The pair eventually reached the Red Hook Pier at night and infiltrated it, as Rand asked Colleen Wing if it bothered her that now everybody knew who he was, but she insisted that it did not. While they looked around the area, Wing noticed that all of the Hand guards were armed with machine guns, as Rand noted that they did not know how to fight. As Wing expressed her nervousness, Rand promoted her back into the fight by claiming the alternative was going back to Cage Fighting, before he had noted the world had not been kind to them throughout their own lives.

Rand quietly speaking with Colleen Wing
Rand told Wing to follow his lead, promising that if she did then the guards would never see them coming, as Rand used his quiet steps and the large shadows to his advantage as he and Wing continued moving forward. When they were almost caught a guard, Rand and Wing took shelter between to containers, as Rand expressed his own gratitude for Wing coming onto this mission with him, expressing his delight at having somebody who he could count on, although Wing insisted he still had Ward and Joy Meachum, to which Rand asked if Wing had somebody who she had felt she could always rely on.

Rand moves along as the container arrives
As they continued moving forward towards the container, Rand had apologized if he had been to forward with his questioning of Wing, to which she told him that she simply was not good at talking, as Rand noted that he often did not know what he was doing or saying at any given time. Wing then apologized if she also at all misread Rand's intentions with the takeout dinner, to which Rand quoted Tuan back at K'un-Lun about not knowing one's own intentions. Having made up for all previous awkwardness, Rand and Wing agreed they needed to get closer as they continued moving to the main container.

Rand and Colleen Wing looking for shipments
Reaching the top of a container, Rand and Wing watched closely as the guards had opened the Rand Enterprises shipments, with Rand filming everything on his phone for evidence. However, to his horror, none of the containers appeared to be carrying anything illegal as they had expected, but Rand refused to accept this, pointing to the guards armed with guns and instead rashly headed down to enter one, leaving Wing to keep watch. Once inside the container, Rand began searching for anything that could link back to the Hand, only for the guards to close up the container, trapping Rand inside.

Rand investigating inside the container
As the truck pulled away, Rand had found himself now without an exit, hoping that Wing would be following, but decided to continue investigating while he was there. Rand went further inside and found a small decorated make-shift living room. Inside he found Radovan Bernivig watching television as Rand had questioned who he was, to which Bernivig revealed himself to be a chemist of the heroin. Before they could talk further, King rose from the couch and saw Rand had broken into the container to take Bernivig away. Without a word, King immediately started shooting at Rand and a fight ensured.

Iron Fist furiously fighting against King
Rand managed to avoid King's gunshots and disarmed him with a kick to the arm before finding the highly trained King was actually a formidable opponent, as his superior strength allowed him to pin Rand against the wall and punch him repeatedly. The moving truck, however, allowed Rand to get free as he started using his speed to gain an advantage, hitting King repeatedly in his pressure points to cause considerable pain. During the fight, King grabbed to blades from the nearby kitchen and had furiously slashed at Rand, however, due to the moving vehicle they were in, King had then inadvertently stabbed Bernivig through the chest, mortally wounding him.

Rand uses the Iron Fist to make his escape
Having finally defeated King with a kick to the head and had left him unconscious on the floor, Rand then grabbed Bernivig who was now bleeding heavily from his wound and prepared to make his escape with him. Finding that the door to the container was still locked, Rand summoned his Iron Fist with his Chi to punch open the backside of the container. He found Wing had stolen a vehicle and followed him. Rand and Bernivig jumped onto the car. Once they then got Bernivig inside, they immediately called for Claire Temple's assistance due to Bernivig's wanted status made a hospital visit too dangerous.

Rand asking for Claire Temple about the Hand
Having made it back at the Chikara Dojo, Temple did medical aid on Bernivig and managed to maintain his life by ensuring that he did not suffocate from a collapsed lung. As he had regained consciousness, Bernivig insisted that they have to take him back, explaining that they had his daughter, Sabina Bernivig. As Rand had asked who were the kidnappers, Bernivig clarified that it was the Hand much to Temple's horror. Rand asked about Temple's knowledge as she warned Rand started a conflict by taking Bernivig. She explained to her colleague had been murdered by them and that they tried to kill her as well.

Rand listens to Radovan Bernivig's demand
Rand asked why the Hand wanted Bernivig, as he explained that he invented the formula to the Steel Serpent heroin and was thus the source. Bernivig pleaded for Rand to save his daughter and Rand reassured him that he would, as Temple explained that this was a usual tactic of the Hand, to take children away from their parents in order to force them to obey their many demands, and that she had seen this before. As Rand had agreed to take on the Hand himself, Temple was highly doubtful that a 'rich kid' would be able to handle this matter and that it required the people with special skills.

Rand accepts the duty of being the Iron Fist
Rand agreed as he then explained that he had been preparing for this his entire life while he had been at K'un-Lun and trained as a warrior by the Order of the Crane Mother, noting that while he may not have been a particularly good businessman and could not be the CEO that his father had been, he knew that this was the one thing he could do better than anybody else. Temple had then realized that Rand was just like the other special people she encountered before, as she had asserted that it was foolish to go against the Hand completely alone. Wing assured that Rand was not alone as she was with him.

Recruiting Ward Meachum
Rand attempts to meditate to find his peace
The next day, Rand returned back into his Office where he had then meditated to consider what his next actions would be now that the wounded Radovan Bernivig was recovering back at Chikara Dojo. As he had meditated, Rand remembered Lei Kung's teaching as his master had told him that due to who he was, there would be forces who rise up against him. Kung explained that this is why he would not tolerate any questioning, as doubt would lead to death.

Rand researching locations of the warehouses
Rand looked at all locations of the warehouses that the Hand might be located as he was assisted by Megan, insisting that Megan start calling him just by simply his first name. Rand and Megan were then interrupted when Ward Meachum entered his office and told Megan that he needed to talk to Rand. Once alone, Rand had explained his situation how how he had found Bernivig who made the heroin and noted how the Hand had kidnapped Sabina Bernivig to ensure that Bernivig did as instructed; however, Meachum interrupted Rand and insisted that there were bigger issues at hand to deal with first.

Rand is given paperwork for the next meeting
Meachum then asked if Rand had now seen the video where he had apologized to Regina Fitzgerald, which was at over six million views, although Rand confirmed that he did and did not understand why it was a problem. Meachum asked why he did not follow the path that he laid out for him as he then explained that corporate leaders for a company like Rand Enterprises must not admit culpability in order to ensure that they were not sued. Meachum also further told Rand that there will be a meeting and they wanted Rand to be there, giving him paperwork to overlook before their meeting took place.

Rand prepares to leave with Ward Meachum
Rand insisted he did not have time for a meeting when someone's life was in danger, telling Meachum to handle the situation himself. Dismissing what he was being told, Rand told Meachum that they would be back in time for the meeting if they went to investigate the warehouses together. With no option, Meachum reluctantly followed Rand, promising to ensure that he would be back for the meeting, comparing him to Harold Meachum. As they got to his car, Meachum was surprised to see Rand had an Aston Martin, while Rand jokingly noted that back in K'un-Lun he had the fastest donkey cart, which had clearly failed to actually impress Meachum before they left.

Rand still angrily lecturing Ward Meachum
Having already visited three of the warehouses and found absolutely no evidence to support his stories, Rand and Meachum headed for the fourth warehouse where Meachum was becoming increasingly more annoyed and angered by what he considered to be a waste of his time, he frustratingly asked Rand to now return back to the Rand Enterprises Building for their meeting, insisting that they would not find any heroin or the kidnapped girl as he believed none of it actually existed. Rand had retorted that he could wait in the car, insisting that regardless of Meachum's feelings he would not stop looking.

Rand discovering King's decapitated head
Entering into the warehouse, Rand and Meachum found a container inside the building, with the back doors still damaged from when Rand had struck them with the Iron Fist. When they entered inside of the container, to the horror of Meachum they found a decapitated head on a spike. While Meachum questioned if they should call the New York City Police Department or not, Rand had recognized the head as King who had he fought the night before while trying to get Bernivig free from the Hand. Rand had then found a message written in Chinese and realized that it was an invitation to a challenge.

Preparing for the Challenge
Rand talks about the challenge from the Hand
Returning into Chikara Dojo to check on Radovan Bernivig's current status, Rand was told by Claire Temple Bernivig was dying from the stab wound inflicted by King. Rand told his friends that the Hand had challenged him to a Da Jue Zhan, as he explained that he would be challenged by the Hand's greatest warriors and, if he managed to defeat all of them, the Hand must finally meet his demands.

Rand rejects Colleen Wing's participation
Rand explained that he had experienced the same kind of challenge back in K'un-Lun, but had never been challenged by the Hand, as Temple insisted the concept was crazy, but Rand noted that it would be the only way to rescue Sabina Bernivig from the Hand before it was too late. Temple had suggested that they call the New York City Police Department, but Rand insisted that this would be too risky as they did not have long to accept the challenge, as Temple called the entire situation completely crazy. Although Colleen Wing offered to go with him, Rand insisted that it was only a challenge for him.

Rand explains that he must face the Hand
Rand explained how the Hand had been told to him as the fairy tale and not something he ever thought he would actually face, as Temple questioned if she actually had more experience in fighting the Hand than Rand could think, which he reluctantly accepted was true. Rand then told the pair about his title as the Iron Fist, although Temple remained confused by what this meant. Wing asked why he was doing this as Rand told that ever since he came back to New York City, it was not what he thought it was, but he knew the Hand was in New York City, he now felt certain that this was what he was meant to be doing.

Rand training for the upcoming challenge
Later during that day, Rand had prepared himself for the upcoming challenge as he meditated and practiced within the dojo. During his practice, Wing had approached and stated that she knew Rand was scared, a statement was Rand disagreed with. Wing expressed her desire to help him with the challenge, but Rand told her to stay and watch over Bernivig, while expressed her worries for Rand's well-being to which Rand promised he will get Sabina Bernivig back and he would not get hurt, as Rand claimed that he was focused on total victory and was certain that he would soon win the challenge.

Rand reassured Colleen Wing to not worry
Wing then approached him and stated that this was not just another tournament, as Rand losing would mean his death, but once again, Rand reassured Wing that would not happen. Wing asked why he was so confident as Rand recited Lei Kung's lesson that doubting would lead to death. Wing left Rand alone to continue his meditation. To calm himself and give him courage, Rand recalled and emulated the time when he asked Thunderer about the Legend of a child who fell from the sky who was destined to be their greatest warrior. Soon after, Rand then left the dojo to go and face his challengers.

Da Jue Zhan
Iron Fist being greeted by Madame Gao
Rand went to the location where the challenge took place, finding the doors opened as he came close. Entering the Hand's sanctum, Rand had then accepted the challenge as the Iron Fist on the behalf of the Holy City of K'un-Lun. He stated his terms. If he wins, the Hand would then release Sabina Bernivig from their custody and then finally depart from Rand Enterprises, never to return. Out of the shadows, Madame Gao then emerged to welcome the Iron Fist on behalf of her master. Gao accepted his terms and then she stated her own: if Iron Fist lost but survived, he must remove himself from all of their dealing, a term that Iron Fist accepted.

Iron Fist arriving to fight his opponents
As per the custom of their culture, both Iron Fist and Gao washed their hands before he followed Gao to the first of his challengers. Iron Fist entered inside the fighting area where he was then challenged by the two twins, Andrei and Grigori Veznikov who were waiting for him. Iron Fist introduced himself and the twins thought it was a joke as they noted how Rand was on the cover of Forbes Magazine and asked if Iron Fist knew that this challenge was a fight to the death. The two brothers then went on to further question why Iron Fist was not protecting the gates of K'un-Lun as both twins were eager to defeat and kill Iron Fist.

Iron Fist preparing to fight the Veznikov twins
Iron Fist then noted that the Veznikov brothers were doing a lot of bragging considering they were tag-teaming against him, to which the brothers claimed that they were not two fighters, but one. The pair then each drew a blade and sliced their own palms, creating a ring by dripping blood on the floor, stating that if Iron Fist fell out of the ring he would lose, and if he was to die, then he would also lose. With the rules set and the warriors ready to fight, Gao started the challenge as Rand got into his fighting pose and readied himself for the fight with the Veznikov brothers armed and also ready.

Iron Fist fighting both the Veznikov brothers
Initially struggling against the Twins' dual assault as they gained an advantage and kicked him down onto the floor, Iron Fist recalled his lessons from Lei Kung and then got back onto his feet, with Kung's instructions to be a double-edged sword ringing in his mind. Iron Fist then quickly gained the advantage by adopting a style that allowed him to hit both twins at once. Briefly pausing the fight, the Veznikov twins continued mocking Rand by noting that the Iron Fist should never leave his post, claiming that Rand himself did not know why he was in New York City and was merely chasing little girls, which had angered Rand as he once again attacked the Veznikov twins.

Iron Fist fighting against Andrei Veznikov
Rand once again fought the Veznikov twins, however, his danger at being mocked caused him to lose his focus as the twins gained an advantage, as Rand barely avoided by slashed with their blades or falling out of the blood circulation which would have caused him to lose the challenge. However, upon once again remembering his master's teaching of focus, Iron Fist continued fighting, as he knocked out Grigori by kicking him against the wall, leaving only Andrei left to try and kill him and gain victory of the Veznikov twins during their duel, as Andrei drew a hidden blade and had then cut Rand's arm.

Iron Fist defeats the Veznikov brothers
Finally, Rand was able to land several hard finishing blows against Andrei, breaking his arm before knocking him to the floor as Andrei was unable to continue fighting or even pick up his blade, as he crawled out of the blood ring and yielded the fight. With both of the Veznikov twins now defeated as Grigori was still unconscious, the Iron Fist stood victorious over them with only a minor cut to his arm, as Gao confirmed that the first battle had been won as she then led Iron Fist further inside for his next challenge, with Rand just briefly pausing to tear off his sleeve to make a bandage.

Fists vs Poison
Rand is surprised by the Bride of Nine Spiders
With Andrei and Grigori Veznikov now finally defeated during the first round of the challenge, Rand was then led by Madame Gao to the next Da Jue Zhan challenger. Entering the next challenge area, Iron Fist found the room filled with smoke with sheets hanging from the ceiling before he was greeted by the Bride of Nine Spiders, as Rand then expressed his surprise that his next challenger was a woman, although he insisted that it did not make him uneasy, despite the Bride claiming that she could sense Rand's fear, while Iron Fist said that she did not as he claimed that he feared nothing.

Rand is seduced by the Bride of Nine Spiders
The Bride then began seducing and distracting Iron Fist, as she then started questioning about Iron Fist's intention and if he hid behind the mask of Danny Rand or if that identity had gone long ago during the fateful Plane Crash. Iron Fist insisted that he was Danny Rand and attempted to ignore what the Bride was saying to him, but the questioning confused and distracted him while he questioned when they were finally going to begin their fight, however, the Bride instead pinned Rand against the wall and had suggested that he could kiss her instead, which greatly confused and unnerved Rand who would be breaking all his vows to give into his own natural urges.

Rand is poisoned by the Bride of Nine Spiders
Amidst her seduction, the Bride stuck a poison needle on Iron Fist's neck. Realizing that his vision was disoriented, Iron Fist had started fighting the woman; however, the Bride was able to take advantage of his disorientation as she easily pushed him away and vanished into the darkness and smoke. The Bride continued evading and dodging his attacks as she continued to stick him with needles, mocking Iron Fist as she claimed that all he wanted was to lose control while also telling him that the more he fought against it and the more his heart raised, the faster the poison would work across his body.

Rand attempts to continue the challenge
As Rand attempted to regain control by taking his deep breath and trying to restore all his Chi, the Bride simply took advantage of his momentary pause and kicked him in the head. As Rand continued trying and failing to land a single strike on the Bride, she continued sticking him with needles, telling him that the rage he was feeling was what all the Order of the Crane Mother back at K'un-Lun were trying to keep away, and she would allow Rand to finally be the real him. When Rand denied this and tried to kick the Bridge, the stuck him again before then throwing him hard against the wall.

Rand is attacked by Bride of Nine Spiders
Losing control of the fight against the Bridge, Rand had yet another vision of Lei Kung, recalling how Kung had told Rand that his crying over the lost of his mother and father was a weakness which Rand had needed to banish in order to move forward. While Rand recalled his lessons with Kung, the Bridge took advantage once again and kicked him to the ground, before seductively straddling his lap before attempting to stab Rand which a dagger. However, Rand was just able to snap back to his senses long enough to block the attack with the dagger before he then kicked the Bride away from him.

Iron Fist overcomes the Bride of Nine Spiders
Encouraged and remembering Thunderer's teaching many teachings to him about overcoming pain, fear and doubt, Iron Fist managed to regain his Chi as he furiously punched the wall behind him, causing sparks to fly down all around him. Regaining his focus at last, Iron Fist witnessed the Bride charging at him armed with the dagger, as he was able to gain one moment of clarity and defeated his opponent with a strong kick to the head which had knocked her unconscious. With the Bride defeated, Gao worriedly announced that the second challenge was won and led him to the third and final challenge.

Rand insists on continuing the challenge
As they walked, Gao asked if Iron Fist was hurt but he insisted that he was not as Gao tried to persuade Iron Fist to withdrawn and Iron Fist made it clear that he would still not be leaving without Sabina Bernivig. Weak from the poison, Iron Fist continued to follow Gao as he remembered Kung's repeating teaching to him. He remembered the time when Kung told him about his decision to enter the cave and face Shou-Lao, warning him that if he survived, his former self will be destroyed before Kung asked if Iron Fist was willing to kill his identity as Danny Rand so that the Iron Fist could then be born.

Final Showdown
Rand introduces himself to the Scythe
While still struggling to walk following his fight with the Bride of Nine Spiders, Iron Fist entered through the door into his final challenge of the Da Jue Zhan as Madame Gao then closed the door behind him. Inside, Iron Fist found his final challenger, Scythe, waiting for him. Scythe asked who he was and he mockingly questioned when the real warrior was coming. Frustrated by the childish questions from his opponents, Iron Fist mocked him as Scythe asked him to choose a weapon, to which Iron Fist affirmed that he was the weapon.

Iron Fist furiously battles against the Scythe
Scythe noted how a weapon should not feel pain and should be used to serve its master, questioning who Rand's master was, as Rand answered that he served only himself, to which Scythe told him that he would disappoint his master. The gruelling battle then took place between the two warriors with Scythe first using a Naginata to keep the Iron Fist on the edge, with the Iron Fist armed only with his own body and his fighting skills. Iron Fist maintained his focus and kept dodging and evaded Scythe's deadly attacks while landing a few counter strikes as he did. Upon breaking Scythe's first weapon, Iron Fist had then questioned which master Scythe had served.

Iron Fist avoiding all of the Scythe's attacks
Scythe explained that he served the Hand without question, with a desire only to serve until his own death, before he had then grabbed a second weapon and furiously attacked the Iron Fist with it. As the fight continued, Iron Fist took the battle to a room filled with metal bars as he took advantage of the small space to force Scythe to furiously swing wildly at him and constantly get his blades caught in between the metal bars, which allowed Iron Fist to break Scythe's weapon in half as he began to gain the advantage. Scythe restored to throwing the blades at Iron Fist, which he managed to avoid.

Iron Fist strikes and defeats the Scythe
Eventually, it led to another room where Madame Gao was waiting and watching the fight take place. Iron Fist gained more focus and encouragement as he remembered Lei Kung's words when he had ordered him to bury his mother and father to submit to the Order of the Crane Mother and become Iron Fist. Having achieved a single-minded focus on the fight, Iron Fist fought Scythe with an extraordinary concentration that time seemed to slow down. Using his Chi powers, Iron Fist broke the Scythe's weapons with ease and struck him down the ground with a single powerful punch with his Iron Fist.

Iron Fist being conflicted on what to choose
Before Iron Fist could finish the fight, Gao warned him not to strike Scythe down, revealing she was holding Sabina Bernivig hostage and at knifepoint, warning Rand that he struck Scythe down, Gao would murder Bernivig. Gao stated that Iron Fist withdrawn from the duel and the young girl will be spared, as Iron Fist denounced Gao's action as dishonorable only for Gao to scoff as she questioned why she should care for the honor. Imagining Kung's lecturing and telling him that his purpose was to destroy the Hand and therefore the girl's life was unimportant, Rand found himself conflicted on what to do.

Rand listens to Madame Gao's monologue
Tormented, Iron Fist continued to remember Kung's words that Rand should finish it but ultimately, Rand withdrew from the duel, unable to sacrifice an innocent person's life, allowing Scythe to go free. Gao kept her promise and released Bernivig as she then stated that she never believed that she would meet another Iron Fist in her lifetime. Gao then asked why Rand left K'un-Lun for New York City as it was obvious that he did not come to destroy the Hand. Rand asked who she was and Gao introduced herself properly, revealing she had been to K'un-Lun by describing the Katsura Tree within its center.

Gao claimed she was interested in how Rand's mind had worked and wondered if K'un-Lun really changed that much as Rand claimed that they still taught honor. When Gao spoke his father's name, Rand demanded to know how she knew his own father, questioning if she had a connection to Rand Enterprises. However, Gao responded by calmly raising her hand up in the air and used Chi to send Rand flying against a wall as Gao left. As Rand left the Wai-Go Industries Warehouse, he looked back and imagined his own master, the Thunderer looking at him with utter disappointment before then turning his back on Rand.

Rescuing Harold Meachum
Rand noticing Harold Meachum in hostage
Following their final conclusion of the Da Jue Zhan, and having also ensured that Sabina Bernivig was safe, Rand had then gone to meet with Harold Meachum at his Penthouse. However, as Rand arrived, he found Alexi and Vando were questioning what Meachum's relationship was with Rand, threatening to cut off his finger if he failed to answer. As Rand had arrived, Meachum, Alexi, and Vando turned around, shocked to see Rand unexpectedly enter the Penthouse.

Iron Fist fights against both Alexi and Vando
Taking advantage of Rand's arrival, Meachum quickly grabbed the nearest knife and stabbed Alexi in the chest, while Vando attempted to shoot at Rand. Reacting swiftly to the new situation, Rand went to Meachum's assistance as he used his speed to avoid Vando's bullets and disarmed him while Meachum still continued brutally stabbing Alexi to death. Although Vando was considerably stronger than Rand, he managed to gain the upper hand with his speed and fighting skills before Meachum got behind Vando and had cut his throat, with Rand dismayed when Meachum had used such brutality to kill them.

Rand tells Meachum about Madame Gao
Meachum insisted that he had no choice as they would have killed him before questioning why Rand did not summon up the Iron Fist during the fight, however, Rand had explained that he could not as he used up all his Chi in the Tournament. Rand further explained that he almost won the Da Jue Zhan, but Madame Gao had then changed the rules when he defeated Scythe, which then forced him to withdraw, although Meachum explained that it did not matter now as the Hand was on to them. Rand asked about Gao, as Meachum explained that she was the one who he had made his original deal with.

Rand then told that Gao knew about his father, to which Meachum claimed that Wendell Rand never told him. Rand informed Meachum that following this revelation he wanted to know what she knew and her connection with Rand Enterprises. However, Meachum warned Rand not to play into her manipulation. Rand asked what they need to do with Alexi and Vando's bodies, to which Meachum said that he would take care of them, but first, he needed to act and made sure that the attacker's original task was accomplished, as Rand had then watched in complete horror as Meachum cut off his finger.

New Love, New Target
Blossoming Relationship
Rand is treated by Colleen Wing
Rand returned back into Chikara Dojo to get the wound given to him by Andrei Veznikov was then treated Colleen Wing while Rand had then informed her about what happened during the Da Jue Zhan. As Wing helped stitch up Rand's wounds, he wondered if he should go to Metro-General Hospital instead and claim that he had been mugged; however, Wing had told him that it was not safe to go into the hospital due to Radovan Bernivig having already been taken away when her and Claire Temple went to the hospital in an attempt to save his life before he had bled to death.

Rand tells Colleen Wing about the challenge
After the wounds are stitched, Wing then checked for more injuries, finding bruises caused by Scythe and all his other opponents. Rand lamented on how he had lost the fight, although Wing suggested that the tournament may have been rigged from the start. Rand noted that he had been given the chance to win, but he was forced to withdraw as Sabina Bernivig's life had been on the line. Rand told her that he intended to learn what Madame Gao knew about his father, although Wing had suggested that Gao may have been lying and that she was just attempting to then make Rand confused and distracted.

Rand receives a message from Claire Temple
As Wing finished cleaning up his wounds, Rand received a message from Claire Temple that Bernivig has been taken to safety. Having put alcohol on his wound to keep it clean, Rand and Wing then sat down together to have a drink, as Rand had reminisced about a time when Brother Kuo would harvest plums every summer to make wine. He told Wing the story when he and Davos went to sneak in at night to drink Brother Kuo's wine. Wing asked for another story about K'un-Lun, Rand sadly replied that there were not many great memories to tell, thinking back to the training and beatings he underwent.

Rand explaining his Mark of Shou-Lao
Wing then asked about the tattoo on his chest, as Rand explained that it was not a tattoo, but the mark of the Iron Fist, although Wing noted that she still did not understand what this meant. Rand tried explaining that it was a unique force that was used to protect K'un-Lun and that it was passed down from generation to generation. As Wing asked why Rand was chosen to Receive the Power, Rand had answered that he was not chosen but that he earned it. Wing asked more about his powers and Rand then explained that it allowed him to harness his Chi, giving him enhanced strength and focus.

Rand affirms Colleen Wing to keep on fighting
Wing asked if he could show it, Rand replied that he could not have recently used it against Scythe, as she wondered if Rand believed that she could not handle the sight and if she was too weak, to which Rand had gently praised that she was the strongest person he had ever met. However, Wing had sadly lamented that she had not been strong enough to protect Radovan Bernivig from being taken by Gao, although Rand did not blame or fault her for that. Wing asked if Rand would keep fighting the Hand, to which Rand had then affirmed that he could not quit now following what he had recently learned.
