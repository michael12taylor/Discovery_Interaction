<html><p>As Rand rose up to leave, Wing had insisted that he should stay at the dojo for the night, although Rand had attempted to decline as he would need to head to the Rand Enterprises Building tomorrow. Then Wing grabbed his hand as Wing tenderly replied that she wanted him to stay. Looking at one another in the eyes, having developed feelings for one another, Rand and Wing shared a kiss. Although Rand briefly paused, thinking of his vows he made at K'un-Lun, he soon removed his shirt and had allowed Wing to softly run her hands over the Mark of Shou-Lao as he and Wing then spent the night together.

Rand tells Colleen Wing about being together
The next morning, Rand had woken up first to watch and listen to the stillness of New York City, as Wing woke up and went to stand with him. Rand tenderly told Wing that he enjoyed the night that he spent together with her, while Wing had also agreed as well, although Rand had then noted that during his time in K'un-Lun he had never before experienced certain things like intimacy before. Wing told Rand that he did not need to hide behind his mask of bravery and bravado as she assured Rand that he could always be honest with her. Smiling, Rand shared a kiss with her, as the new relationship ignited.

Gao's Unexpected Visit
Rand is about his father's files from Megan
Rand returned back to Rand Enterprises Building where he straight away asked Megan to find any old files about his father mentioned the name Madame Gao, as Megan explained that these files were in storage and she would have them brought up. Fearing this was too specific, Rand asked for every single one of the files, no matter how many there were, jokingly noting that his office was big enough.

Rand reading about the company's chemicals
As he was speaking to Megan, Joy Meachum approached Rand and had wanted him to come with her. Inside the board meeting room, Meachum informed Rand that she has written him a statement for his recent action in him apologizing to Regina Fitzgerald over the Rand Enterprises Chemical Plant situation. As Rand read the document, he noted it sounded like an apology, although Meachum insisted it is the first step to restore Rand Enterprises's image. Rand questioned what will happen to the plant itself as the result of this, although Meachum had seemed completely indifferent about Rand's question.

Rand is informed about the company's cases
Rand stated that it might make people sick as Meachum replied that the EPA cleared them. Rand asserted that all fifteen cases of cancer were not a coincidence as the frustrated Meachum professed that she cared about what was happening to these people, but she also cared about the company. Meachum informed Rand that she had no idea where Ward Meachum was. She further criticized Rand's action of not showing up at meetings and when he did, he was beaten up following the Da Jue Zhan. Meachum reminded Rand fought hard to get into the company and now it was the time to start working.

Rand notices Madame Gao inside the building
At the same time, Gao entered the floor from their elevator much to Rand's shock, as Rand excused himself from Meachum and went into his office to find Gao placing a plant on his furniture. Gao chided Rand that he needed to take better care of himself as she had disliked his office and the lack of harmony, noting how the poisoned arrows had weakened the soul, referring to his clash with the Bride of Nine Spiders. Rand asked how she got in as Gao simply smiled and explained that she had been in Rand Enterprises far longer than he had and she did not have any intention to leave anytime soon.

Rand approaching Madame Gao in his office
When Rand approached closer, Gao quickly raised her hand to stop him as she cautioned Rand about attacking an old woman in his own office and in front of his employees. Rand insisted that he passed her test and she knew what he was capable of. Maintaining her calm posture, Gao was not threatened by Rand's words as she had seen another carried the title of the Iron Fist as she further explained that the other Iron Fists were fierce and would never have backed down from a Da Jue Zhan just to save an innocent girl from being killed, as Gao believed this showed considerable weakness in Rand.

Rand listening to Madame Gao's explanations
Rand then questioned why Gao used a symbol from K'un-Lun on her packets of heroin, before he then questioned how she had known his father. Gao, however, simply continued her monologue as she claimed that she had been alive long enough to see the entire world change in many ways, but she noted that this present change felt significant, mentioning Daredevil and Luke Cage and now an Immortal Weapon who had suddenly left K'un-Lun for New York City and had therefore abandoned his duty. Gao had then openly wondered in the current of change if they could be something other than mortal enemies.

Rand asks Madame Gao about his father
Gao deduced that Rand did not leave K'un-Lun to hunt the Hand, but he left as he wanted to be Danny Rand. Gao stated that she needed his company, but all the spoils would be Rand's to enjoy, suggesting Rand to buy a yacht or enjoy time with his friends, Colleen Wing and Claire Temple as Gao warned that New York was no place for the Iron Fist. Gao approached closer and placed a hand on Rand's cheek as she chillingly told Rand that this was the best offer she would give. When Rand tried to ask about his father, Gao simply chuckled before walking out, while also reminding Rand to water his plant.

Investigating Madame Gao
Rand prepares to follow Madame Gao
Rand watched while Madame Gao left his office and then headed for the elevator, as Rand noted that Gao used a Rand Enterprises card. Determined to get his answers, Rand had opened the elevator doors with pure strength, seeing that the elevator with Gao inside was currently going down as Rand had wanted to know what Gao's true intentions were, for himself as well as his company. Summoning his Chi, Rand gave a prayer to Buddha before he had used the Iron Fist to grab the elevator cable and follow.

Rand following Madame Gao on the next floor
He managed to land on the elevator undetected and, once Gao and her guards were out, Rand entered into the elevator from the ceiling. Noticing he was on the 13th floor, which had seemingly been unused for quite some time. Rand began sneaking further inside the floor as he looked for Gao, finding her having a meeting with Sophia who was explaining how the Hand would use Rand Enterprises to transport all their shipments of Heroin which Gao was producing, along with the assistance of both the Russian Mafia as well as the Dogs of Hell who would be tasked with driving the Rand trucks with the heroin.

Rand listening to Madame Gao's conversation
Gao then noted that quantity of heroin would not be a problem as Rand had then learned that Radovan Bernivig was almost ready to give up the formula and that they would start mass-producing soon, allowing them to continue selling Gao's own supply of the deadly heroin across New York City with the assistance of Rand's company, which had greatly angered him. When Sophia noted that Hai-Qing Yang was still a problem for them, Rand further heard that Gao would dispatch the Yangsi Gonshi. Gao concluded their meeting, while she commented on how she wanted to change the look of the office.

Rand interrogates Sophia for answers
Once Gao and her guards left, Rand had quietly stepped out of sight before he then went to interrogate Sophia in order to gain answers. After a brief struggle, Rand managed to subdue her as Rand calmed down when he realized that the woman was scared and she did not had a choice in following the Hand. Rand warned that she could not go back to Gao as she killed King, who was the last person who tried to defeat him, telling her to instead run and never return. Rand then managed to convince the woman to help him by giving the password to the tablet she was using so he could defeat the Hand first.

Company Decision
Rand is given his father's files from Megan
Returning back to the office floor, as Megan informed Rand that his meeting with the Rand Enterprises board would be starting soon and insisted he could not appear with his dirty suit, which had been messed up as he slide down the elevator shaft. As Rand changed dress, Megan revealed that she only found one box of his father's documents and inside there was only an envelope that had contained Wendell's member card and nothing else, while Megan noted that over the fifteen years many of the files would have been moved around from room to room and eventually lost.

Rand ask about Regina Fitzgerald
Looking at his father's member card, Rand then asked Megan if she thought this was a good company, as she noted that to work for it was, despite commenting that she had recently lost her dental plan. Rand then led the question over to the Rand Enterprises Chemical Plants, questioning what Megan's feelings were over that video of Rand apologizing to Regina Fitzgerald over her situation. After some persisting, Megan simply revealed that her mother lived within Staten Island where Fitzgerald's son had also become sick, to which Rand declared that he would then be making a few phone calls.

Rand tells the board about his recent decisions
Rand entered the Board meeting as Joy Meachum handed Rand the statement for him to read and commented that he had once again arrived late. Rand told the board that he was aware that some were not happy with him and his recent decisions, but stood firm that until they could be absolutely sure, they will be shutting the plants within Staten Island. He also said that they should keep everyone on payroll so no one lost their job when the power plant had closed. Lawrence Wilkins told Rand that this isn't how business was done and not how his father would have wanted.

Rand reveals his story to the New York Bulletin
Rand retorted that his father was gone and had believed in fighting for what's right. Maria Rodriguez reminded Rand that he may have a voice but it was just a courtesy as Wilkins further reminded that he should not expect anyone to listen to someone who got their MBA from K'un-Lun as Meachum went to Rand's defense. Rand revealed that he already called Karen Page who had already written the New York Bulletin article for the front page tomorrow. With that said, Rand excused himself from the board. Trapped, the Board could now only comply with Rand's demands much to their frustrations.

Harold Meachum's Advice
Rand asks Harold Meachum about secrets
Later, Rand went back to Harold Meachum and gave him the tablet as together they found numbers and shipments of the Steel Serpent, although Rand seemed distracted throughout the conversation. Rand asked Meachum if he knew about the thirteenth floor, to which Meachum jokingly replied that had he known, he would have had Ward Meachum charged rent. As Rand had pressed him, Meachum simply maintained that he had always been honest with Rand.

Rand seeing the Hand's illegal actions
Rand expressed his disbelief that all this time, the Hand were using his company for their illegal actions as Meachum assured that was why they were doing this to make Rand honest again. Looking through the files, they deduced that Madame Gao needed to use their own company for all of her current criminal operation of selling the heroin to continue to work smoothly, before they learned that there was a Warehouse in Brooklyn where the Hand could be manufacturing their drugs as Rand was certain that Radovan Bernivig was there and wanted to save him.

Rand is told to first face Madame Gao
While Rand explained who Bernivig was and how he was connected to the creation of Gao's heroin, Meachum had advised Rand not to go to his rescue, insisting that he would then be one man facing off against Gao's army of Hand soldiers and that he needed an army himself in order to take her down. While Rand noted that he could not bear to leave Bernivig behind to be killed by Gao, Meachum instead had further suggested that he should focus on defeating Gao and not save Bernivig, believing Gao to be the more important target for them, which Rand's conscience struggled to accept.

Alliance with the Hatchet Men
Rand observes Darryl's graduation in the dojo
Following his meeting with Harold Meachum, Rand had gone straight over to Chikara Dojo and found the graduation of Darryl. Rand waited in the doorway until Colleen Wing was finished with her students and wishing Darryl good luck as he prepared to go to University to take an Elite Training Program. Rand had listened smiling while Wing gave her congratulations to Darryl before she then gave a speech to the rest of her students who were still in the dojo, then telling them that together as warriors, they would always be a stronger unit.

Rand informing Colleen Wing about the Hand
Once they were alone, Rand then informed Wing about the Hand's knowledge of her whereabouts and her connection with him as well as Claire Temple, putting them both in serious danger. Although Wing still reassured that she could handle herself, Rand remained nervous as Wing then asked about Radovan Bernivig, as Rand told her that he knew where Bernivig was being kept and that he had a plan to get him free, but a risky one. Wing maintained that she will help him as he said they need to go immediately. When Wing questioned where they were heading, Rand said they would get their allies.

Rand talks to Hai-Qing Yang about the Hand
Later, Rand and Wing went to had a talk with Hai-Qing Yang and his gang at the Golden Sands, as they tried to convince them that they could fight together and end the Hand's Heroin operation. Yang had doubted that they would be able to succeed and questioned why he should attack now, to which Rand had then explained that he had overheard about Madame Gao's intention to wipe the Yangsi Gonshi out, as Rand also further pressed that the Hand had feared him as he was the Iron Fist and joining forces to switch to his own side against them, the Hand would eventually fear the Yangsi Gonshi as well.

Rand listens to Radovan Bernivig's information
With the alliance formed, the Hatchet Men had gone and assaulted the warehouse, providing a distraction for Rand and Wing to sneak further inside. They found Bernivig, sitting on a chair and dying from his wounds, as Bernivig asked for Sabina Bernivig as Rand assured him that she was fine and safe. Rand asked for Gao, while Bernivig asked for forgiveness, revealing that he told her about how to make the Heroin. Before dying, he revealed that Gao was in Anzhou, much to Rand's complete horror, as Anzhou had been the location that he and his parents went on the flight that claimed their lives.

Grim Discovery
Rand receiving a phone call from Temple
Following the attack against the Hand's Warehouse Rand had then headed back to Harold Meachum's Penthouse to discuss the recent events. On the way, Rand tried to call and warn Claire Temple about the danger, unknown to him that she was off taking a shower and there was already someone there. He left a voice message to a warning of the danger of Madame Gao's men. When he entered the apartment, he didn't find Meachum except for a pool of blood in his office which completely horrified Rand.

Rand noticing Harold Meachum was killed
Expecting the worst had happened, Rand heard someone entering the Penthouse; however, when he went to face the intruder, it turned out to be Ward Meachum, who pushed Rand away and questioned what he was doing in his father's Penthouse, to which Rand claimed that he thought Ward could have been an assassin from the Hand. Following some initial scolding from him, Rand told Ward to sit down before explaining that something terrible had happened to his father, which Ward merely scoffed at. However, Ward then saw the pool of blood and had reacted in a state of both horror and shock.

Rand blames himself for facing the Hand
With Ward looking like he was ready to throw up, Rand took him to sit down before Ward then asked why it happened, as Rand blamed himself because it was his actions in challenging the Hand as well as destroying Gao's Heroin Supply that had seemingly led to Harold's death, claiming that he had thought that attacking Gao's criminal empire would finally end this conflict. Ward then furiously berated Rand for not thinking things through and his action led to his father's death, claiming that he could not bring down a criminal conspiracy by destroying a few buildings that were owned by the Hand.

Rand agrees to stay away from Joy and Ward
Rand apologized for his actions and their consequences, Ward then furiously mocked Rand and had called him cancer, noting how as a result of Rand's foolish actions, Ward would have to mourn the death of his father for a second time. Remorseful over his mistakes, Rand vowed to go to Anzhou and locate and capture Gao once and for all, although Ward claimed that he did not care what Rand did next, as long as he stayed far away from him and Joy Meachum, which Rand sadly agreed to. Determined to go avenge his beloved father figure's death, Rand then left Penthouse, taking the tablet with him.

Capturing Madame Gao
Reckless Plan of Attack
Rand declares the Hand's next operation
Regrouping with Colleen Wing and Claire Temple, Rand declared his intention to go to China as soon as was possible, as he explained how he had learned there was a Hand factory within Anzhou and Rand was convinced that this was not a coincidence that he and his parents were heading there and it led to their fatal Plane Crash. Rand explained that his father never visited foreign areas and therefore a possible explanation was that he must have suspected something to go there and investigate himself.

Rand insist on where to find the Hand
Wing asked if Madame Gao was producing her Heroin there as Rand noted that it was possible that Gao had learned that his father was investigating and so Gao then caused the plane crash, as Rand was only certain that Gao would punish anyone who crossed her. Temple warned that his plan was reckless and it could be a trap and that Gao could simply be lying about everything, claiming that the plan completely sucked which Rand took great offense to. Rand insisted if there was even a small chance that he could get the answer to his questions over the accident, then he must take it.

Rand plans to track down Madame Gao
Rand made his decision to go to Anzhou alone; however, Wing said she would go with him and when Rand protested, as Wing reminded him that the last time he went alone to the Da Jue Zhan, he returned bruised and beaten. Temple also stated that she would join them, as she was tired of running and being helpless following the Attack on Metro-General Hospital and the death of Louisa Delgado. Temple asked what Rand's plan was and he could only think of tracking her down and take her captive. When Temple questioned that plan, Rand made an outburst. Realizing his disrespect, he apologized.

Flying into China
Rand calms himself during a wind collision
Their group got onto Rand's Private Jet together and had all headed over to China. Along the way, Rand had continued checking over the tablet until the plane started shaking, which had caused his trauma from the Plane Crash to kick in. Rand had managed to get calm as Claire Temple had approached, looking at his iPod, noting Rand's taste for old school music. Temple had inquired about Rand's relationship with Colleen Wing, as Rand was puzzled and blushed by her question, but Temple still quickly deduced the nature of their relationship and then lightly teased him.

Rand ask Claire Temple about relationships
Rand asked Temple if she had her boyfriend but Temple denied this, although Rand said that he had seen her read the letter several times and the writing was distinctly not feminine. Temple explained that he presently was not available. Temple asked Rand if he soon found out that Madame Gao did indeed kill her parents if he was going to do anything foolish but Rand tried to hide it by explaining that he had trained fifteen years at K'un-Lun to control his emotions, but Rand still claimed that if he really did kill her, then he would only be fulfilling his duty as Iron Fist which had made Temple uncomfortable.

Rand listens to Claire Temple about killing
Temple questioned if that justified murder as Rand argued that he swore to protect the people of K'un-Lun from the Hand, as Temple made it clear that killing was wrong no matter what. Nearby, Wing had then calmly questioned if Temple would feel the same way if someone had killed her mother and father. Temple claimed that an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind although Temple still acknowledged that she was not special, she had seen enough people die to understand the value of life, to which Wing countered by noting how many lives Gao destroyed through her actions.

Rand again calms himself with Colleen Wing
The discussion stopped as the plane started shaking again as Rand became stress. Temple tried to reassure him that turbulence was not dangerous, but Rand retorted that his mother told her the same thing before she was ripped out of the plane. Seeing him panicking, Temple helped Rand to relax by asking him to tell them how he was feeling and ignore the facts, as Rand told them about the accident, he watched his parents die and he lost unconsciousness from there. He recalled finding his father's corpse and the monks taking him in. After some struggle, Rand had eventually calmed back down.

Pursuing Madame Gao
Rand waits for Madame Gao to finally appear
Upon arriving in Anzhou, the group then headed for the Facility that the Hand was seemingly located and began to wait for their target to show herself as they continued considering what their plan of attack needed to be. While they waited for an opening, Rand overlooked the facility with a pair of binoculars, as Colleen Wing questioned if Rand was nervous of Madame Gao failing to turn up there, although Rand had instead claimed that it was just the long waiting for something to happen that made him nervous.

Rand agrees with Colleen Wing about death
As Rand sat on the car next to her, Wing shared a bit about her past with Rand by telling him that she had watched her own mother die in front of her as well when she had died of an illness while Wing was still young and confused, noting how her own father had never really spoken about what was happening and just sent her to Japan to live with her grandfather. Rand and Wing both agreed that they had felt a sense of being abandoned following the deaths of their family, while Rand noted that no matter how much he was loved elsewhere, it was never quite the same feeling before they shared a tender kiss.

Rand tells Claire Temple about waiting
However they were interrupted as Claire Temple awoke from inside the car and asked for an update, as Rand noted that they still had not seen anything significant, although they had deduced in which building Gao's Heroin was being produced in. Eventually, Rand had become annoyed by all the waiting and decided to beat up a guard for information, however, Wing had instead suggested another way to get information. Wing then spoke to a Blind Beggar and convinced him to give her information on the facility. Based on this information, they learned that the guards and slaves left in the evening.

Rand suggests go inside the warehouse
As the group had discussed how Gao was keeping slaves within the facility, Rand suggested that they wait for the workers to leave for their evening meal, before they sneak in and burn the place to the ground. Temple, however, questioned the plan, asking if was a good idea to burn down the only place where they knew there was at least a chance that Gao may turn up, however, Rand had simply replied that this was a way to force Gao out of her hiding by disrupting her business. Once the workforce left, Rand and Wing sneaked inside while Temple had stayed behind with their car to stay safe.

Rand hides away from Madame Gao's guard
Ready to go make their move, Rand put his hood up while Wing had armed herself with her Katana as together they made their way inside the facility, silently climbing over a large gate while remaining out of sight. Having successfully dispatched the guard, they went inside the drug lab. Wing had noted that the symbol on the heroin resembled Rand's chest tattoo while he explained that it was the same symbol from K'un-Lun but made in mocking by stamping it on heroin. Rand started pouring flammable substance on the lab as Wing questioned if Rand really planned to capture Gao as he had claimed.

Rand finding the Hand's lab and their heroin
Rand reasoned that this was not the time to talk about it, however, Wing had still said that Gao was going to keep destroying people's lives if she stayed alive. Rand answered that he was not sure what will happen, but if Gao was responsible for his Plane Crash, he would likely kill her, although he confessed to Wing that the prospect scared him. She related that she also felt out of control when she fought in the fighting ring and she had always been in control as Rand asked what changed and Wing answered that she met him. Rand asked if it was his fault, as Wing teased that everything was his fault.

Rand and Colleen Wing plan to split up
While they were still preparing to burn down the laboratory, however, Rand and Wing then heard Temple loudly honking on the car horn to alert them of incoming danger. The quickly hid as Gao had entered the laboratory with three of her bodyguards, while they speculated on who was making all of the noise. Having stayed out of sight while Gao explored the building, Rand then told Wing to go and find Temple to ensure she was still safe, while Rand went after Gao himself. Although Wing noted that Gao was waiting for him, Rand still insisted that he would be fine and told her to find Temple.

Iron Fist vs Drunken Fist
Rand observes Zhou Cheng near a door
Meanwhile, Rand followed Madame Gao and her guards while they headed to another building in the area, with Rand watching from a distance as Gao then demanded that Zhou Cheng, who guarded the entrance door, awake from his drunken sleep to let them all inside, before Cheng then laid back down and went back to sleep. Rand approached and woke Cheng up in his drunken stupor, believing him to be another beggar, Rand attempted to bride Cheng to sleep elsewhere Rand could then get inside.

Rand bribes Zhou Cheng to gain entrance
Annoyed, Cheng told Rand that he was comfortable here as he had advised him not to force him to move, as Rand reasoned that he did not want to fight him. Chuckling, Cheng had introduced himself as a disciple of Ch'i-Lin and sworn defender of the Hand. Rand asked if his master insisted him to drink this much while Cheng got to his feet and explained Ch'i-Lin had demanded his drinking, noting that while others chased the dragon, he would need to keep his sedated since bad things would happen if he did not. Cheng then cheerfully said that since they were going to fight, they might as get started.

Rand is challenged by Zhou Cheng to fight
With no other option, Rand accepted the challenge as both fighters bowed as they immediately started their duel. Cheng, however, had proved himself to actually be a surprisingly formidable opponent, as his drunken fist style made his movement chaotic and unpredictable for Rand, even as he continued drinking throughout their fight. Cheng taunted Rand, noting how he had thought the Iron Fist was meant to be a great warrior of K'un-Lun and compared his style as a child who was simply throwing a tantrum. Angered, Rand then retaliated that a man only fought with his mouth when his fists are lacking.

Iron Fist attempts to fight against Zhou Cheng
Resuming a different stance, they resumed their fight as Cheng was again had gained the advantage by using head butts and strange kicks to surprise Rand, briefly lying on the floor smiling to himself as Rand recovered. As they kept fighting, Cheng continued mocking and taunting Rand by telling him that the only regard in which Rand was superior to him was in his haircut which Cheng complimented. Eventually, Rand lost patience as he smashed Cheng's wine bottle, which only succeeded in angering Cheng as the drunken fighter had landed several hard hits which made Rand spit out blood.

Rand declares to stop the Hand for his people
Changing into a more aggressive style, Rand succeed in landing a few hits on Cheng and kicking him against the floor. As he got to his feet, Cheng then grabbed a new bottle of wine while he continued taunting Rand, noting that just like him, Rand had sworn a vow, but unlike Rand, Cheng had always remained true to it. Rand snapped back that he was trying to end the greatest threat to his people to which Cheng then retorted that his intention was to punish and not protect. Cheng told Iron Fist that he was only wearing his oath like a mask and asked the Iron Fist where was the honor in that.

Rand defeats Zhou Cheng with multiple blows
When Cheng threw his bottle at him, however, the Iron Fist was then immediately able to grab the bottle out of the air and smashed it over his opponent's head. With an opening finally clear, the Iron Fist then landed several strong strikes against Cheng's body before he finally managed to punch Cheng through the entrance door. In his fury, Iron Fist began savagely punched his opponent to a bloody pulp. He had finally stopped when Claire Temple and Colleen Wing had appeared and urged him to stop before he was able to continue beating Cheng to death, as Rand looked at his actions in complete horror.

Confronting Madame Gao
Rand insists to not harm Madame Gao
Following their duel, Rand was dismayed and remorseful for nearly killing Zhou Cheng in his rage, stepped away as Claire Temple went to check on him. Rand worriedly asked if Cheng was okay, only for Temple to ask Rand if he had looked okay as Rand saw Cheng was covered in blood from being repeatedly hit in the face. Temple then reminded Rand that he said that he had it under control as Rand, shaken and alarmed, only responded that he thought he had.

Rand ask for what happened to his parents
They were interrupted when Madame Gao appeared to greet Rand, as she had advised that anger was a gift if he knew how to control it and claimed that it would be her privilege to teach him. Rand insisted that he did not want to hurt Gao, but that he simply wanted to know what happened between his father and her as Gao inquired if that's what driven him to this state. Rand theorized that his father tried to shut the Laboratory down and she killed him, but Gao chided that a shot in the dark rarely found its target. Rand asked if she denied this, only for Gao to responded if he would believe her if she did.

Iron Fist fighting all of Madame Gao's soldiers
When Rand tried to approach closer, Gao raised her hand and had warned Rand not to take another step closer to her, as Gao promised that if he submitted to her, she would ensure that Colleen Wing and Temple were granted a merciful death. Rand stated that he would die before he let her touch them as Gao only responded that she could not allow Rand to do that before she had ordered her men to attack Temple and Wing. The brief fight ensued, with Wing armed with her own Katana while Temple had put on a pair of Tekko-Kagi, as Rand continued fighting against the men with just his bare hands.

Rand realizes the poison on the soldiers
The fight against Gao's men turned out to only be brief, as, despite the men's superior strength and strong weapons, Rand and his allies worked together as a team and managed to cause one man to even impale his ally with his own weapon before Wing knocked him out. As they looked over the defeated Hand soldiers, Temple noticed that the guards' weapons were poisoned when they started reacting to it. Rand recognized the poisoned veins on the guards resembled how the deceased pilots looked following the Plane Crash, as Rand then realized that Gao was indeed responsible for the accident.

Rand almost kills Madame Gao with his chi
Becoming absolutely furious at finally discovering that Gao had been the one who was responsible for deaths of his mother and father, Rand harnessed his Chi as the Iron Fist had burned brightly. Despite Temple attempting to get him to stop, Iron Fist then charged toward the panicked woman and threw a powerful punch at her; however, ultimately, Iron Fist spared Gao's life, as Rand had used his anger to completely obliterate the door behind Gao. As the Iron Fist had faded away, Rand then took Gao captive, as Rand told his friends that they were finally leaving China with Gao now as their own prisoner.

Looking for Answers
Rand watching the captured Madame Gao
Having taken Madame Gao captive, they brought her back into New York City and tied to a chair in Chikara Dojo. While his companions questioned Rand's decision to bring Gao back to the dojo, Rand had noted that they must not allow their enemy to chose the battlefield, although Gao had asked why they should be enemies. He told his friends that he would not be turning Gao over to the New York City Police Department until he found out what she knew despite Claire Temple's suggestion that they should take her over to the police.

Rand personally questioning Madame Gao
Gao had asked if they truly believed that a prison cell was where she would actually end up if she was delivered. Rand pressed Gao to tell him what the connection between his father and the Hand, although Gao had instead questioned why he was still asking for things that happened fifteen years ago when he had more pressing concerns. In anger, Rand demanded answers before he nearly punched Gao, who remained completely unintimidated by him as she did not even flinch at his clenched fist, before Colleen Wing then told Rand to stop and brought him into her room to then talk about their situation, all while Gao still remained extremely calm about her current situation.

Rand chooses to question Madame Gao
Rand was forced to defend his actions as Temple questioned what they were doing, as Temple asked if Rand was close to torturing Gao simply to try to get the answers he wanted which Gao may well still lie about. Rand reasoned that he had needed to know why his father and Rand Enterprises had something to do with the Hand, although Wing questioned the motive since it would not change his feelings towards his father. Wing said that Rand already knew that Gao was responsible for their Plane Crash and asked why this was not enough and why he felt the need to continue personally questioning Gao.

Rand agrees to not torture Madame Gao
Seeing that both Wing and Temple were against his current plan of questioning Gao, Rand had then asked why they were imposing him, as Wing replied that they didn't want him to do something he would regret like torturing and killing Gao for unreliable answers. Knowing that they simply needed to know if Gao was telling the truth, Temple got an idea that they take Truth Serum from Laboratory at the Rand Enterprises Building and use it to get their answers that they needed from Gao as Rand and Wing both agreed, while Wing had also noted that this plan would at least be better than torturing Gao.

Taking Truth Serum
Rand listens to Joy Meachum's lecture
Seeking to begin the plan, Rand left Chikara Dojo and had made his way through New York City in order to get the truth serum ready to begin the questioning, only to bump into Joy Meachum along the way. Although Rand tried to move along past Meachum, she had then informed him that both she and Ward Meachum had just been successfully pushed out of Rand Enterprises by Lawrence Wilkins, much to the complete shock of Rand himself, as Meachum noted that Rand himself had been stripped of all his titles and powers with the exception of his shares in the company.

Rand is further questioned by Joy Meachum
When Rand had questioned how this could have possibly happened, Meachum blamed him, noting that ever since he had turned up out of the blue from K'un-Lun, everything had changed for the worse, and his filmed apology to Regina Fitzgerald and taking hard stances on both the Leishmaniasis Cure and the Chemical Plants had eventually forced the board's decision to push them out. As Rand apologized, Meachum noted that her brother had vanished, noting Ward took her to the Penthouse before freaking out, although Rand denied knowing anything before walking away, with Meachum not believing him.

Rand looking for hallucinogenic drugs
Having now been banned from entering it following his firing, Rand returned the to Rand Enterprises Building and was forced to break inside the lab to look for the Sodium thiopental, finding the door to the lab itself was locked as Rand proceeded to break the window on the door window to open it from the outside. As he looked all around for what Claire Temple had told him they would need for Madame Gao's questioning, Rand was eventually discovered looking all around in the laboratory by Sandi Ann who awkwardly told him that he was not allowed there anymore, which Rand could not deny was true.

Rand is helped by Sandi Ann to find the drug
Believing that he could trust her, Rand told Ann how he was looking for just one thing and that he needed her help to find it, as she had eventually agreed, although reluctantly, noting how she loved and needed her job and requested that if Rand was caught by anybody then he would deny ever seeing her there, which Rand agreed to. As Rand told Ann what he wanted, she questioned what he would be needing it for, before changing her mind and telling him that she did not actually want to know, before Ann did as she was instructed and found the Truth Serum for Rand, allowing him to then leave.

Questioning Madame Gao
Rand finds Colleen Wing being poisoned
Eventually, Rand returned back to the Chikara Dojo where he had found Colleen Wing lying in her bed, while clearly sick, although Wing insisted that she was simply having the flu from their journeys to China and back to New York City, as Wing urged Rand to focus on interrogating Madame Gao in order to get the answers he needed as she claimed they did not have much time, although Rand was still highly unsure and nervous about Wing's current condition as she had suddenly gotten so incredibly sick.

Rand injects Madame Gao with Truth Serum
As Rand confirmed that he got everything, Claire Temple immediately went to prepare a dose of the Sodium thiopental. Rand went over to Gao and asked if she was afraid of needles, while Gao had simply replied confidently that Rand was about to face something that he was still completely unprepared for, to which Rand had tauntingly questioned if she got something scarier than a Dragon in a Cave which Rand had previously experienced himself, while Gao simply smiled and replied that she did, throwing off Rand's confidence with the situation while Temple confirmed the serum was ready to be used on Gao.

Rand listens to Madame Gao's motivation
Once they injected her with the dose, Gao initially laughed if that was all they gave her; however, then the serum had seemingly started to work. Rand then started asking his questions about how she knew his father, although Gao answered that she knew Heather Rand and she introduced Gao to Wendell. She talked about how Heather was so easy to manipulate, but Wendell did not want to make a deal with the Hand. Then she went over to Harold Meachum while noting how Meachum had been a lot more willing to make a deal with them, but before Rand could question Gao any further, she fell asleep.

Rand takes attention to Colleen Wing
Rand still insisted that the drugs had failed to work, as he insisted that Gao could not have had a relationship with his mother, although Temple noted that Gao might not have the answers that Rand was looking for. However, before Rand and Temple could then discuss it further, Wing stumbled out of her room as she immediately fell to the floor in agony. Rand and Temple went straight over to her side as they immediately found out that she had been poisoned from a cut injury she had gained fighting back in Anzhou, as Temple noted that was not able to help her when she did not know the poison.

Rand leaving a message for Bakuto
Then Gao had revealed that she had been faking asleep and lying the whole time as the truth serum did not work on her. She chided them and asked if they really thought the drug would work on her, boasting that she spent most of the 17th Century being interrogated in similar manners. Rand pressed for what poison her Hand soldiers had used, but Gao refused to answer. Wing urged Rand to call up her Sensei for aid, as Rand had then immediately called only for no one to pick up, while Rand could only leave a voice message to the Sensei informing them of the serious situation which Wing was currently in.

Siege of the Chikara Dojo
Rand reassures Colleen Wing will survive
Later as they waited for the Sersei to arrive and offer his assistance, Rand tried to reassure Colleen Wing that they would get out of there and that they were going to be okay, while Wing's poisoned wound continued to cause her considerable pain as it slowly killed her. When he overheard them, Madame Gao mocked both Rand and Wing as she called them as children, but Rand simply ignored Gao's mockery and continued to promise Wing that they would make it out.

Rand prepares to fight Madame Gao's men
However eventually, the lights throughout Chikara Dojo were then cut out as they realized that someone was approaching, while Gao had taunted Rand that his time was over and he was going to watch his friends die because of him. While Claire Temple armed herself with her Tekko-Kagi, Rand had told Wing and Temple to stay calm as their eyes would get adjusted to the dark, as Wing noticed a small camera filming them. Gao's men threw a smoke bomb into the Chikara Dojo and broke the ceiling to enter as Rand summoned his Chi and gained the Iron Fist to give himself an advantage during the fight.

Rand battles against Madame Gao's men
The armed men entered and a fight ensued, with Rand using the Iron Fist to destroy their weapons with a single strike, while he and his allies protected Gao from being taken away and kept all the attacking men at bay. While Wing used her Bo Staff, despite all of her previous injuries, Rand used his superior fighting skills alongside Temple to gain the advantage over the attackers. They eventually succeed in defeating the guards, as Rand knocked out the final man with a hard kick to the head, before checking that all of his allies were okay and had not received any fatal injuries during the skirmish.

Rand checks upon Madame Gao's men
While Rand insisted that they had to tie up all of the unconscious men before they awoke, Temple had noticed they were not Hand ninjas but military men. With her escape attempt having failed, Gao pointed to the now considerably weaker Wing and then made Rand an offer, if Rand escorted Gao to safety she would make sure that Temple had clear passage to Metro-General Hospital and was given the antidote to cure Wing before he poison was able to finally claim her life, noting that Wing did not have long left to live; however, Rand was urged not to listen to her from Wing as Gao was likely still lying to him.

Saving Colleen Wing
Rand struggles to fix Colleen Wing
With Colleen Wing's condition worsening further was the time had ticked over, Rand and Claire Temple had struggled to find the way to help Wing, but they were perplexed and continued to ignore the mockery of Madame Gao who had insisted that it would not be long until the poison had reached into Wing's brain and finally killed her. With seemingly no way for them to help Wing in her current state other than trying to offer her some comfort, Rand then warned Gao that if Wing died, then he would kill Gao.

Rand introduces himself to Bakuto
While this was happening, Wing's Sensei then knocked on the door, as Wing urged them to open the door. While he had kept Wing calm, Rand had approached and asked how he got in when the soldiers were everywhere, to which the Sensei had calmly claimed that he had taken care of Gao's men, as he then proceeded to show them proof when a soldier who he had already dispatched dropped down from the window. Gao was distressed seeing the Sensei and said he had no business there and told him to leave, however, Rand knew he was the only hope for Wing and opened the door for the Sensei.

Rand follows Bakuto's lessons on healing
As he knelt down beside the dying Wing, the Sensei had introduced himself as Bakuto. He urged Rand to use his Chi to heal her with the Iron Fist, while Gao had still claimed that Rand was about to fall into a trap that he would not be able to escape from. Rand noted that he did not understand what Bakuto wanted him to do as Bakuto realized that Rand had not been taught this in K'un-Lun, he then told Rand to summon his powers into the Iron Fist. Guided by Bakuto, Rand had finally managed to use the Iron Fist to burn out the poison as Rand had succeeded in managing to save Wing's life just in time.

Rand successfully cures Colleen Wing
Although he was successful in saving Wing's life, the technique had completely drained him of his energy, as Rand discovered that he could barely stand and, although he had claimed to be fine, Rand eventually collapsed on the ground. With Rand now out of action, Bakuto's men entered and took Rand and Gao away from Chikara Dojo, intending to take them back to their Compound to be treated and recharge his Chi. While Rand got brought into their vehicle and driven away with Bakuto and Wing, Another Man still observed the situation and calmly followed while Temple was turned away.

Bakuto's Deception
Recharging Chi Energy
Rand wakes up in bed with Colleen Wing
Having been taken away from Chikara Dojo, Rand eventually woke up and had found that he was now in a bed in a calm and peaceful room, although he did not know where he currently was. Turning around, Rand found Colleen Wing sleeping beside him, as he woke her up by affectionately caressing her. Rand had asked Wing where they were, as Wing reassured him that they were in a Safe Location and her home. After exchanging a few tender words and while checking that Rand was okay following him using up all his energy while saving her life, they softly kissed.

Rand and Colleen Wing explore Bakuto's base
Rand and Wing went out to explore the Compound, Wing explained that she came there when she had returned to the United States of America from living in Japan with her Grandfather. Rand asked if this place was a monastery or school, Wing replied that it was something of both while Wing explained that it was a safe place for people who needed a home, noting that they had taken her in and helped her to get settled. She then explained that Bakuto was the sensei not just for her but for everyone in the compound. She told Rand that Bakuto and his students were her family, noting that she was glad that Rand was there with her while she had affectionally touched his arm.

Rand recharges his Chi alongside Bakuto
Bakuto, who was training his students, went to greet Rand personally as he asked how Rand was feeling and Rand assured he was okay. He thanked Bakuto for showing how to heal Wing as Bakuto asked if he was ready to recharge his Chi, although Rand was confused and explained that his own training back at K'un-Lun had gone sideways when he had returned to New York City. Bakuto then taught Rand a different meditation technique, which allowed Rand to recharge his Chi, while Bakuto told him to release the negative energy holding him back, as Rand finally commented that he was feeling hungry.

Rand has a private conversation with Bakuto
With their training now done, Bakuto and Rand had started heading towards the office to have a private talk. Rand asked Bakuto about his Organization and why Wing had never spoken about Bakuto, to which Bakuto had answered that she was simply protective. Bakuto answered that their organization takes people in who need help in life. As they talked, their conversation led to Madame Gao as Bakuto told him that Gao was currently in solidarity until they are certain it was safe to hand her over to the authorities. As they headed towards the office, Rand noticed a compound with armed guards.
