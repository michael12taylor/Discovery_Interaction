<html><p>Taking cover by a car, Spider-Man attempts to contact Hogan again to ensure if he is safe, being told that he and his friends are fine. Spider-Man told Hogan that he's trying to get to Mysterio but can't avoid the many Combat Drones, all while using his webs to shoot above and use the car in front of him to cling onto and swung up to push the car onto the drones, destroying them completely. Landing on top of the bridge, Spider-Man saw the drones using flames against him.

Spider-Man swiftly riding on a Combat Drone
As he avoided the flames by swinging away from the built in flamethrowers, Spider-Man was then caught in the flames and tried to shake them away from his suit. With his upgraded suit, Spider-Man handled the drones and confined them to the side of the bridge with his webbing, sticking onto them until they explode on impact. Spider-Man swung under the bridge and used the water to put out the flames on his suit and then using one of the drones for a ride around the bridge.

Spider-Man trapping many Combat Drones
After drone that he was riding had been destroyed, Spider-Man shot his webbing at one the drones and swung up around to destroy the many upcoming drones in front of him. Now above the two bridges, Spider-Man used his webbing to set a trap between them and swung up into the string of webbing to enclose them with his webs and bring them down, destroying the surrounding drones that were all around him. As the big explosion had settled Spider-Man away from him in the air, he landed on his feet in satisfaction that handled them all.

Spider-Man seeing the illusion forming again
After the coast was seemingly cleared, Spider-Man was then pushed back by one of the Combat Drones and was slammed by one of the cars that were piled on, causing him fall onto the water. Swimming back up and managing to get up from the shoreline, Spider-Man saw the drones lining up to prepare the illusion. Jumping over to the bridge again, Spider-Man realized his out of web fluid and looked over to see if he can reach above to get to Mysterio.

Spider-Man prepares for an incoming attack
Upon sighting a downed drone with a concussion wave being blasted continuously, Spider-Man found a toy and threw it at its sonic cannon, which projected the toy into the air and the drones overhead attacked it. Based on this, Spider-Man then devised a plan by using the battery of a broken drone, paired with the broken off sign of the Tower Bridge. After getting his supplies, Spider-Man prepared to charge forward and attack the drones from above.

Spider-Man apprehends Mysterio in the air
As the drones saw him running, Spider-Man used the sign as a shield and threw the battery at the drones, leading them to destroy it. As the drones had exploded next to each other, Spider-Man used the sign to hoist himself up to one of the upper walkways, breaking the glass floor below it. Hanging upside down, Spider-Man apprehended Mysterio and broke his interface dome helmet, which disengaged the remaining drones piercing the vault of the Jewel House, and deactivated upon reaching Hogan and Parker's friends.

Duel with Mysterio
Spider-Man declares to give back the glasses
Atop Tower Bridge's upper walkway, Spider-Man had hold Mysterio up in the air after breaking his dome helmet. Spider-Man told Mysterio that his lies are over but was told that he had contingencies and was shot down by one of the summon Combat Drones that Mysterio had called upon through E.D.I.T.H.'s network. Being shot at and send several feet away from Mysterio, Spider-Man got up on his feet and told Mysterio to give up the glasses.

Spider-Man prepares to use his Spider-Sense
Once Mysterio asked Spider-Man if its the glasses he was holding are the ones he wants, he witnessed a number of Mysterio's Combat Drones disappearing as well as himself, transforming the rest of the room into dark void with green gas clouding all over the ground. Being noted that he has get the glasses back, Spider-Man took a breathe to focus on the goal and prepared to use his sixth sense to avoid the Combat Drones. With his eyes close, Spider-Man ran towards the hall once he was ready to fight.

Spider-Man fighting against Combat Drones
Spider-Man then jumped up to the side of the wall and punched down an incoming drone from down under. Spider-Man continues to attack the numerous drones by using his superhuman agility and strength to dodge away any incoming fire or drone charging at him. Using the pipes on the ceiling for more leverage, Spider-Man kicked down a drone and stopped one of them with his bare hands. Spider-Man grabbed another drone and split it to two pieces, stabbing any incoming drone that gets in front of him.

Spider-Man confronts Mysterio for his actions
As the dark illusion had fallen apart, Spider-Man used drone as a shield to protect himself from fire until he broke free and pushed a drone back. Once Mysterio was shot down by drone that was pushed, Spider-Man wrestled with a drone until it blow him back against the ceiling, causing him to knock down incoming drones away and destroy the final drone. Once Spider-Man destroyed the last drone in the walkway, he stood over Mysterio and asked him if he had a reason to do all this.

Spider-Man stops Mysterio from shooting him
After Mysterio told Spider-Man that he agreed on his behavior and how he deserved the glasses the whole time, Spider-Man sensed his surroundings again while Mysterio was about to pass the glasses down to him. Spider-Man then grabbed Mysterio's wrist without looking and turned over to him, noting that he can't be tricked by his illusions anymore. As the illusion fell apart, Spider-Man took the glasses away from Mysterio and told E.D.I.T.H. to turn off the drones.

Spider-Man calls off all of the Combat Drones
As the biometric scan was completed once Spider-Man had put on the glasses, he was asked if he wants to execute all cancellation protocol's for the remaining Combat Drones, answering yes to execute all the drones. Once E.D.I.T.H. confirmed to execute the drones, Spider-Man witnessed the drones flying away from the Tower Bridge, as they return back into the Stark Industries Satellite that is hanging above in space.

Spider-Man checking if Mysterio is really dead
Happy to see all the drones gone, Spider-Man took the glasses off and turned back over to Mysterio, as he dropped to the floor from his injuries. Spider-Man asked Mysterio how he could do all of this, being told that people need to believe and that now in days people will believe anything before Mysterio had succumb to his wounds and died. Putting on the glasses, Spider-Man asked E.D.I.T.H. to confirm if Mysterio's death was an illusion, being told that all illusions are down.

Parker being reunited with Michelle Jones
With the crisis averted, Parker then exited the walkway and into the Tower Bridge, where Michelle Jones discovered him, hugging each other for comfort. Asking if anyone else is fine, Parker listened on as Jones confirmed that his friends survived. After Jones noted to Parker that the drones were attacking her and suddenly stopped, he told her that it him that stopped them. Jones further noted that she brought a mace in case Parker needed some help.

Parker passionately kissing Michelle Jones
When Jones brought up that Happy Hogan gave her a Black Dhalia necklace, Parker was disappointed that it broke and told her about his whole plan to give it to her in Paris, but was then kissed by her. As Parker was confused, he was told that she had difficulty getting attached to people and wasn't just looking at him because he's Spider-Man. As they expressed their feelings to each other, Parker and Jones passionately share a kiss before returning to the trip.

Return to New York
Leaving Europe
Parker and Michelle Jones rests on the plane
With the Midtown high school European Tour trip concluded, Parker managed to get back into his group and onto the airplane for a ride home. Parker took a nap on the flight with Michelle Jones, as they slump over for resting too deeply, chuckling at their mishaps and continued resting for whole ride home.

Parker happily talking to Michelle Jones
Once the fight ended upon landing back into Newark, New Jersey where they were about to greet by their respective families, Parker and Jones walked together in the airport, holding hands to signify their new relationship. While the rest of the group were meeting their families, Parker asked Jones if anyone has figured out his secret identity, being noted that no one has since nobody really pays attention to him, except for her; thanking her for the compliment.

Parker reunites with his aunt at the airport
As Jones left the airport, Parker was told by Betty Brant they look cute together, leading him to offer her and Ned Leeds to go on a double date. Parker was told by the two of them that they broke up, being told that when men and women grow apart their journey will always be with them. When Parker exited the airport to find his aunt, he found her as she was about get a ticket, hugging her in relief and noted to her that he felt fine before she asked him about his bags until she remembered that they were blown up.

Date with MJ
Parker asks May if she's dating Happy Hogan
A week after returning from Europe, Parker went on a monologue in his home about how he kept his identity very guarded for the last couple of years and faced a lot of deception. Parker was tired of the lies and had an intervention with his Aunt May and friend Happy Hogan about them becoming a couple. When Parker asked his aunt of the question, May told him they weren't dating at all, much to the confusion of Hogan.

Parker awkwardly leaves his room for his date
As Parker was confused from their unclear dynamic, he continued listening to May and Hogan argue about their status, with May feeling unsure where Hogan was taking their brief romance and Hogan rationalizing that they might have a relationship which can grow. Once the conversation grew awkward as it was revealed that Hogan is stuck at being friends with May, Parker excused that he has go out for a date with Michelle Jones, departing as fast he could.

Spider-Man taking a selfie while web-swinging
After Spider-Man made his awkward exit, he started swinging over to Jones and got his phone to take a picture of himself web-swinging. Spider-Man continued to swing over high distances and ran on walls of a building, apologizing to the employees who were inside of it. As Spider-Man kept on web-slinging around New York City, he received a text from Jones, saying he shouldn't text and swing before almost hitting himself against a bus. After swiftly dodging it, Spider-Man ran on top of the bus and continued on web-swinging.

Spider-Man swiftly continues to web-swing
Going up on a building to gain some momentum, Spider-Man shot his webbing at the top and ran on the side of rooftop, giving him edge to jump off it and dive straight into the air. As he neared the location he intended, Spider-Man activated his equipped web-wings and glided through a new opening in the former Avengers Tower to the Grand Central monument. He then landed on a street pole to break his momentum, and spun down to plant his feet to meet Jones.

Spider-Man web-swinging with Michelle Jones
Now on the ground, Spider-Man met with Jones on the sidewalk and apologized to her about being late. As Jones told him it was fine, Spider-Man asked her if she's ready, as she accepted before telling her that she's going to love it. Starting their date, Spider-Man swung with Jones across New York, which placed her in a state of heightened fear given the speed. Spider-Man continued on over City Hall where Jones screamed in terror as they were in the air holding hands.

Spider-Man drops off Michelle Jones in the city
After sometime passed, Spider-Man was told by Michelle Jones that he could put her down now, leading him to stop at Madison Square Garden. Spider-Man asked her if she was fine, as Jones assured him that she was indeed but admitted to not enjoying the ride with him. Once the two mutually agreed to never do that again, Spider-Man parted ways with Jones and perched atop a light post, waving bye as she left.

Identity Exposed
Spider-Man watching the news in public
Taking notice of the breaking news broadcast from the NY1 station, Spider-Man turned around to watch the outer television monitor of the stadium. As news anchor Pat Kiernan reported on the attack in London, Spider-Man listened closely about an anonymous source that provided video of Mysterio's final moments before his death. As Mysterio talked over in the video, Spider-Man was accused for killing him and staging a crisis to try and become the "next Iron Man."

Spider-Man sees his identity being exposed
When Kiernan went on about having the footage being cited from the controversial online news site, The Daily Bugle, the online tabloid's host, J. Jonah Jameson, accused Spider-Man to be responsible of the murder of Mysterio, who would go down in history as the greatest superhero of all time. As Jameson went on, the broadcast showed more footage, displaying Mysterio revealing Spider-Man's civilian identity, horrifying Parker as he swore in public.

Identity Crisis
To be added

Personality
Outside of his Spider-Man alter ego, Parker lives the life of a normal high school student, being a very intelligent science enthusiast, capable of inventing and building his own Web-Shooters, as well as homemade computers. Parker is also an avid Stars Wars and science-fiction fan, making frequent pop-culture references to it in battle. He collects both science and comic books in his room, where he also keeps his Spider-Man suit. Parker is a friendly but shy and awkward individual; he is happy to talk but often stumbles on his own words in a conversation. Parker deeply cares about his and friends and Aunt May, his only family.

As opposed to Iron Man or Captain America, Parker makes it a point to keep his identity secret since if such knowledge was made public, his aunt would be worried sick and he would have major trouble with the law on the grounds of vigilantism. Parker even restrained Tony Stark with webbing when Stark implied telling his aunt his secret identity. Parker, however, had no hesitation in revealing his identity to people he associates with through his allies, such as when he met Doctor Strange, Captain Marvel, and Mysterio. As such, when Beck revealed his identity to the world, Parker was shown to be utterly horrified and devastated.

Parker is also highly impressionable towards figures of authority, which is likely due to his young age and inexperience. An example of this was towards Captain America; when asked about why he was fighting, Parker stated that it was because Stark claimed Rogers was in the wrong, while he had no opinion of his own on the matter. Parker was also very excited to be in a fight with other superheroes, to the point where people on both Captain America and Iron Man's teams were asking how old he was, due to his child-like behavior during the Clash of the Avengers. As such, he was also the least experienced fighter at the airport battle.

A neophyte to being a superhero, Parker idolizes Iron Man and sees him as a role model. He also admires and has great respect for Tony Stark, even when the latter contemplated telling May his identity, which he was strongly against. Through his first official mission as Spider-Man, Parker showed a strong desire to impress the other superheroes and prove his worth, especially towards Iron Man. As Spider-Man, Parker is courageous and capable, being able to come up with clever strategies due to his scientific expertise. His bravery even led him to secretly board a Q-Ship in an attempt to help Iron Man against the universal threat of Thanos, despite knowing that Parker could lose his life in the conflict to come. He frequently annoys his enemies with fast-talking humor and quipping, prompting members of both Captain America's faction and Iron Man's to ask how old he was during the Clash of the Avengers. Parker and Tony became close to the point where when Parker learned of his impending death at Thanos’ hands he clutched to Stark terrified and weeping over dying and apologizing to Stark before he faded. After Parker was resurrected and fought in the Battle of Earth, he was visibly distraught at the sight of his dying mentor, apologizing once again before breaking down and crying as Iron Man died.

During his fledgling career as a superhero, Parker was shown to be stressing over his jokes and trying to make a lasting impression on people. At first, Parker was overly-excited about being Spider-Man and constantly called Happy Hogan asking about "a new mission with the Avengers," unknowingly irritating him. He was very displeased about having to stick with minor jobs like stopping a bike theft or helping an elderly woman.

Parker gets frustrated when other superheroes do not take him seriously due to his young age. Above anything, Parker wanted to prove himself and the other superheroes that he can handle being the Spider-Man despite being a teenager, but he tends to try too hard which results in him doing reckless actions and annoying others. Parker was particularly angered when he found out Stark was limiting many of his suit's functions with the Training Wheels Protocol and demanded Ned Leeds to hack into the suit to disable it. His lack of familiarity with the suit's full capabilities initially put him at a disadvantage, though he managed to hone his skill with it through the help of Karen.

His overzealous nature even caused him to get make various mistakes, such as losing his backpack and civilian clothing by leaving them an alleyway where people could take them or restraining a man attempting to get into his car, thinking he was a car thief. His immaturity often causes him to make mistakes while in dangerous situations, especially in combat. He is notably prone to distract himself by making conversation with his opponents, making less effort than necessary to actually defeat them and end their threat, which leaves him open to attack. His loss of focus often times has him lose awareness of his surroundings, which allowed Captain America to trap Parker underneath a jet bridge, caused him to accidentally knock himself out when he jumped against a ceiling he thought was still rendered intangible by a Matter Phase Shifter and allowed Vulture to trap him underneath a gas station. In rare instances, Parker's recklessness has threatened the lives of innocents, as his battle with robbers destroyed Delmar's Deli-Grocery, nearly killing the people in the store, as well as his skirmish on the Staten Island Ferry resulting in it being split in half by Parker failing to contain a weapon used by Vulture, who himself mocked Parker for attempting to handle things he did not understand. These situations would come to partially humble Parker, who became more aware of his flaws and more determined to rise above them.

Multiple encounters with Vulture and getting crushed under a gas station caused Parker to better understand the dangers of being a superhero, becoming more serious and determined to capture Vulture on his own while wanting to prove to both himself and Stark that the Spider-Man Suit is not what makes him strong. He does value life, ordering Karen to not make him kill anyone when he activated his 'advanced combat mode'. Parker even tried to stop Vulture from overloading his wings and when it happened, he risked his life to save Vulture from the explosion and resulting fire, despite Vulture attempting to kill him and knowing his secret identity. However, he was shown to use a strategy that would threaten the lives of his enemies, as his plan to have Iron Man breach the hull of the Q-Ship they were in resulted in the death of Ebony Maw, who was sucked into the vacuum of space.

Successfully capturing Vulture led Parker to show signs of becoming a more mature and responsible superhero. When he was finally given the chance to become an official Avenger, he turned it down feeling he still was not ready yet, a decision which Stark himself applauded. When Parker was anointed as an official Avenger, he was shown to be both honored and exhilarated.

Eight months after Stark's sacrifice and death, Parker was shown to still be reeling from the loss of his beloved mentor. When he spotted a tribute of Iron Man in the form of a graffiti on a wall, Parker promptly turned his head away, clearly feeling anguished as he broke into tears soon after. Parker also began to feel mounting pressure to succeed Stark as the world's next Iron Man, as seen when he fled from the crowd of reporters who were hounding him with questions about the topic. Parker's reluctance to replace Iron Man may be due to the fact that Parker views himself as unable and unfit to fill in his mentor's shoes and continue his vast legacy. In contrast to when he initially wanted to do more and become an Avenger, he now wanted less and would rather keep being a street crime-fighting hero and enjoy a vacation.

After encountering Mysterio and gradually familiarizing himself with the "hero," Parker soon came to see the former as a close comrade and a role model akin to Stark, feeling comfortable enough to discuss his personal life with Beck and confessing his relief at the prospect of being able to disclose his woes and troubles with a fellow superhero. Parker's respect and admiration for Beck were so great (more so after witnessing the former being more than willing to "sacrifice" himself fighting an Elemental) that he went so far as to bequeath the immensely formidable E.D.I.T.H. to him, entrusting the latter to continue Stark's legacy and succeed him as the next Iron Man. After discovering Mysterio's true nature and subsequently defeating him, Parker shed tears over the former's death but nevertheless resolved to continue Stark's heroic legacy after a rousing talk with Happy Hogan.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Artificially Enhanced Physiology: After Peter Parker was bitten by a spider, he gained the proportionate physical capabilities of a spider. With his newfound heightened abilities, Parker deliberately holds back from participating in sports to avoid being suspicious, such as football due to having a superhuman advantage. Despite his restrictions, Parker is still shown to be athletic and even received commendation from Coach Andre Wilson for his participation in Captain America's Fitness Challenge.
Superhuman Strength: Spider-Man possesses considerable superhuman strength, due to it being the proportional strength of a spider. Although he is relatively untrained, his strength alone is sufficient enough to catch a 1.5-ton car that was moving at 40 miles an hour when it was just inches away from hitting a bus, and he claimed to Ned Leeds to be able to move a bus with his bare hands. He was also able to casually overpower the Winter Soldier and his cybernetic arm, pushed Captain America to his limits for a prolonged period of time, breakthrough a bulletproof glass window with only a few blows, lift up rows of school lockers, slightly topple a gigantic Ant-Man, as well as to support the weight of a jet bridge, and was even able to lift a considerable portion of concrete roof that Vulture had collapsed on top of him, though both feats visibly strained him. During the Black Order's arrival in New York, Parker was able to catch Cull Obsidian's hammer moments before it struck Iron Man, and swing a car at Cull Obsidian. His strength is sufficient enough to stagger Thanos, though he was outmatched and subdued swiftly when facing the Mad Titan on his own. Parker's strength helped him overcome Mysterio's Drones. He was able to punch and kick through them with ease while simultaneously dismembering mechanical components to use them to his advantage in a sophisticated fashion. He was able to hold and slightly pull together a Ferry cruise boat before Iron Man come to assist him. During the Ambush in Berlin, he punched a depression into a concrete wall. Peter can also easily hold the case containing his suit with one arm, whereas a grown man like Happy Hogan struggled to lift it up with both arms. His incredible strength also allowed him to knock out Flash Thompson with only a slap even though he was completely unintentional. Spider-Man's physical strength also extends into his legs, enabling him the ability to jump and leap to a height of several stories in a single bound. As a result of the spider's bite, Spider-Man can leap much higher than a normal human, easily capable of jumping and leaping from one building over a street to the next.
Superhuman Durability: Spider-Man's body is inhumanly resistant towards impact forces and blunt force trauma, as he has taken a punch from Winter Soldier and a spinning air kick from Captain America without any serious injuries. Additionally, Spider-Man easily endured a collision with a metal beam while being dragged by Falcon's Redwing flying at full force and a strike from Captain America's Shield, as well as being backhanded by a gigantic Ant-Man, falling unharmed from several stories in the process. Parker only sustained a black eye from the entire Clash of the Avengers and was able to pass it off as a result of bullies at school while telling his Aunt May. Moreover, Spider-Man survived being dragged from a speeding van and endured hits from garbage bins and stacks of bricks, withstand multiple blows from the Shocker's Gauntlet unharmed, as well as Vulture collapsing a considerable portion of a concrete roof on top of him, with only minor injuries. Parker was even able to withstand a blow from the tremendously strong Thanos while wearing the Iron Spider Armor. However, according to Karen, even Spider-Man would most likely not survive a fall from the top of the Washington Monument. He later survived a plane crash and a fall from the inside of an elevator shaft while only being incapacitated, which he recovered from faster than a human would. While Spider-Man followed Ebony Maw's chase for Doctor Strange and the Time Stone, Parker was unfazed by the various objects flung at him by Maw, even shaking off a direct collision with a billboard, resuming his pursuit. Parker could endure a car being blasted at him from a combat drone as well as a missile with mild discomfort. Parker was also able to survive a high speed train heading towards him, and manage to survive with only minor injuries and mildly nauseated, though he did require some of his injuries be stitched up by Happy Hogan. Despite this, he was able to function at full capacity, enough to battle a multitude of Mysterio's drones with his great agility and strength.
Superhuman Speed: Spider-Man can run and move much faster than an ordinary human and is adept at dodging quickly. Spider-Man was also quick enough to catch up to a speeding vehicle on foot. His speed has allowed him to casually catch the Winter Soldier's bionic arm before it could even punch him. During the Avengers Civil War, Spider-Man was able to easily outrun both Black Widow and Black Panther (the latter being able to run as fast as a zebra) and avoid Scarlet Witch's telekinetic attacks, as well as dodge many of the blasts fired at him by Star-Lord when he fought him on Titan and dodge rapid gunfire from Mysterio's horde of combat drones.
Superhuman Agility:     Parker leaping high above his school's fence   After Spider-Man gained his powers, he became as agile as a spider, being able to make movements that would be extremely difficult for a normal human with great facility, capable of swinging around on thin spider-webbing and jumping great distances and heights without difficulty. His bones, muscles, and joints have more elastic strength and durability, allowing him to perform gymnastic and contortionist maneuvers without damaging his bone structure. He used his agility to outmaneuver and beat both Winter Soldier and Falcon, dodge most of Vulture's attacks and even dodge the many cars that Scarlet Witch telekinetically hurled at him. Spider-Man's mobility was proven to be beneficial for going up against opponents such as Cull Obsidian and Thanos. It was also extremely favorable during Parker's swift movement to prevent a large amount of debris from falling upon civilians during Hydro-Man's attack on Venice, as well as his graceful traversal around the city to meet up with his love interest, Michelle Jones.
Superhuman Stamina: Spider-Man's advanced musculature produces fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair him.
Superhuman Reflexes: On several occasions it has been shown that Spider-Man possesses reflexes far beyond the capabilities of normal humans. In conjunction with his Spider-Sense, Parker is able to easily dodge full auto gunfire in point blank range from numerous invisible drones with his eyes closed during his battle with Mysterio. Spider-Man also possesses a heightened sense of equilibrium which greatly enhances his balance and coordination. Parker is able to adjust his position by instinct.
Enhanced Senses: Spider-Man's senses are greatly enhanced, with him describing them as being "dialed to eleven". Hence, Parker is able to sense potentially dangerous things shortly before they occur. For example, if an object is being thrown at Spider-Man, he will usually be aware of it, even if it is hurled from far away and he is facing the opposite direction.
Enhanced Vision: Spider-Man's sense of sight is superhuman, to the point that he is forced to wear dark goggles to prevent it from handicapping him in a battle, as there is "too much input."
Spider-Sense:      Parker sensing nearby danger   Attributed as an extrasensory ability, Spider-Man's brain intakes and responses to stimuli at an accelerated rate, acting as a precognitive ability to sense potential or immediate danger, a kind of "sixth sense" ascribed to Spider-Man. This awareness thus implies some kind of intelligence, capable of parsing Spider-Man's surroundings, identifying and critically evaluating a potential threat at a subconscious level, thus alerting Spider-Man of dangers he cannot readily notice at first, allowing him to effectively dodge and counter incoming attacks in combat, including projectiles aimed at him even from a blind spot. Provided with his extraordinary speed and wall-crawling, the spider-sense is sufficiently well-linked to his superhuman kinesthetics and reflexes, and it permits Spider-Man to evade all manner of spontaneous dangers by an evidently instinctual exercise of some uncanny reflex. It also gives him omnipresent detection to his surroundings, which is how he web swings without looking where he shoots his webs with ease. This was also demonstrated when Parker was able to catch the small cartridge of web fluid tossed to him by Tony Stark, even though he was facing away from him. This ability also doesn't seem to work on individuals Parker doesn't subconsciously consider threats, like his Aunt May. During the Clash of the Avengers, he sensed the bench that Winter Soldier had hurled at him while he fought Falcon. During the Ambush at the Staten Island Ferry, he sensed someone coming his way and, without looking, incapacitated him with a web grenade. Later, he was also able to dodge Vulture's Exo-Suit at full speed, effectively maneuvering in close quarters at a high rate of speed. However, as his enhanced reflexes directly correspond to his sensory input, he can be rendered vulnerable to attacks if his senses are overloaded, such as during his final fight with Vulture. Spider-Man also, despite his incredible reflexes, can be caught by surprise should he allow himself to get distracted, as seen when he was ensnared by Redwing's grapple line due to his excitement during the Clash of the Avengers. While on a bus during a field trip, Parker was able to sense Ebony Maw's Q-Ship descending on New York City, despite being miles away from the site. He is also susceptible to attacks if he does not have sufficient time to elude the attack. After crash-landing the Q-Ship on Titan, Spider-Man was able to sense a threat was going to happen before warning Iron Man and Doctor Strange. His senses had also warned him of his impending demise at the hands of Thanos moments before he began to fade away. When Parker was attempting to explain that Mysterio is a fraud, he sensed the presence of imminent danger, before it physically appeared. Furthermore, Parker's spider-sense outwardly possesses a directional component and can guide him to or away from concealed danger and disguised enemies, such as using his senses to elegantly dodge and attack the invisible Stark Industries Combat Drones that were heading towards him. After Spider-Man defeated all of the drones, when Mysterio gestured the glasses to him, his senses warned him of the real Mysterio cloaked beside him with a gun to his head, allowing him to anticipate Beck's murder attempt, and countered immediately.
Regenerative Healing Factor: Spider-Man's increased metabolism allows him to rapidly heal and regenerate from harm faster and more extensively than normal humans can recover from. He was able to rapidly heal from a black eye from Giant-Man after nearly a day had passed. After suffering multiple wounds from his fight with Vulture, Parker's scars were fully healed in a matter of hours. He similarly recovered in mere hours from many bruises and cuts he gained during the Battle of Earth, after Sanctuary II opened fire on the battlefield and then during Mysterio's ambush on him, in which he was repeatedly attacked by Stark Industries Combat Drones disguised with holographic illusions and then being struck at full force by a speeding train after being lured into its path by the illusions.
Wall-crawling: Spider-Man can adhere to walls, ceilings, and other surfaces in order to scale them and has stated that he does not use any adhesive gloves or fabrics to do it. This ability allows him to stick to almost any surface when willing himself to, as physical contact with said surfaces creates a locking connection necessary to support his body, even when he is inverted above the ground. Alternatively, Parker could make individual portions of his body adhesive, which allowed him to stick his foot onto the chest of a bank robber to fling him into a wall. He was able to have a car stick onto his hand and easily lifting as well without required strong grip when fighting against armies of drones lead by Mysterio.
Superhuman Strength: Spider-Man possesses considerable superhuman strength, due to it being the proportional strength of a spider. Although he is relatively untrained, his strength alone is sufficient enough to catch a 1.5-ton car that was moving at 40 miles an hour when it was just inches away from hitting a bus, and he claimed to Ned Leeds to be able to move a bus with his bare hands. He was also able to casually overpower the Winter Soldier and his cybernetic arm, pushed Captain America to his limits for a prolonged period of time, breakthrough a bulletproof glass window with only a few blows, lift up rows of school lockers, slightly topple a gigantic Ant-Man, as well as to support the weight of a jet bridge, and was even able to lift a considerable portion of concrete roof that Vulture had collapsed on top of him, though both feats visibly strained him. During the Black Order's arrival in New York, Parker was able to catch Cull Obsidian's hammer moments before it struck Iron Man, and swing a car at Cull Obsidian. His strength is sufficient enough to stagger Thanos, though he was outmatched and subdued swiftly when facing the Mad Titan on his own. Parker's strength helped him overcome Mysterio's Drones. He was able to punch and kick through them with ease while simultaneously dismembering mechanical components to use them to his advantage in a sophisticated fashion. He was able to hold and slightly pull together a Ferry cruise boat before Iron Man come to assist him. During the Ambush in Berlin, he punched a depression into a concrete wall. Peter can also easily hold the case containing his suit with one arm, whereas a grown man like Happy Hogan struggled to lift it up with both arms. His incredible strength also allowed him to knock out Flash Thompson with only a slap even though he was completely unintentional.

Parker was even able to withstand a blow from the tremendously strong Thanos while wearing the Iron Spider Armor. However, according to Karen, even Spider-Man would most likely not survive a fall from the top of the Washington Monument. He later survived a plane crash and a fall from the inside of an elevator shaft while only being incapacitated, which he recovered from faster than a human would. While Spider-Man followed Ebony Maw's chase for Doctor Strange and the Time Stone, Parker was unfazed by the various objects flung at him by Maw, even shaking off a direct collision with a billboard, resuming his pursuit. Parker could endure a car being blasted at him from a combat drone as well as a missile with mild discomfort. Parker was also able to survive a high speed train heading towards him, and manage to survive with only minor injuries and mildly nauseated, though he did require some of his injuries be stitched up by Happy Hogan. Despite this, he was able to function at full capacity, enough to battle a multitude of Mysterio's drones with his great agility and strength.
Superhuman Speed: Spider-Man can run and move much faster than an ordinary human and is adept at dodging quickly. Spider-Man was also quick enough to catch up to a speeding vehicle on foot. His speed has allowed him to casually catch the Winter Soldier's bionic arm before it could even punch him. During the Avengers Civil War, Spider-Man was able to easily outrun both Black Widow and Black Panther (the latter being able to run as fast as a zebra) and avoid Scarlet Witch's telekinetic attacks, as well as dodge many of the blasts fired at him by Star-Lord when he fought him on Titan and dodge rapid gunfire from Mysterio's horde of combat drones.
Superhuman Agility:     Parker leaping high above his school's fence   After Spider-Man gained his powers, he became as agile as a spider, being able to make movements that would be extremely difficult for a normal human with great facility, capable of swinging around on thin spider-webbing and jumping great distances and heights without difficulty. His bones, muscles, and joints have more elastic strength and durability, allowing him to perform gymnastic and contortionist maneuvers without damaging his bone structure. He used his agility to outmaneuver and beat both Winter Soldier and Falcon, dodge most of Vulture's attacks and even dodge the many cars that Scarlet Witch telekinetically hurled at him. Spider-Man's mobility was proven to be beneficial for going up against opponents such as Cull Obsidian and Thanos. It was also extremely favorable during Parker's swift movement to prevent a large amount of debris from falling upon civilians during Hydro-Man's attack on Venice, as well as his graceful traversal around the city to meet up with his love interest, Michelle Jones.

Superhuman Stamina: Spider-Man's advanced musculature produces fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair him.
Superhuman Reflexes: On several occasions it has been shown that Spider-Man possesses reflexes far beyond the capabilities of normal humans. In conjunction with his Spider-Sense, Parker is able to easily dodge full auto gunfire in point blank range from numerous invisible drones with his eyes closed during his battle with Mysterio. Spider-Man also possesses a heightened sense of equilibrium which greatly enhances his balance and coordination. Parker is able to adjust his position by instinct.
Enhanced Senses: Spider-Man's senses are greatly enhanced, with him describing them as being "dialed to eleven". Hence, Parker is able to sense potentially dangerous things shortly before they occur. For example, if an object is being thrown at Spider-Man, he will usually be aware of it, even if it is hurled from far away and he is facing the opposite direction.
Enhanced Vision: Spider-Man's sense of sight is superhuman, to the point that he is forced to wear dark goggles to prevent it from handicapping him in a battle, as there is "too much input."
Spider-Sense:      Parker sensing nearby danger   Attributed as an extrasensory ability, Spider-Man's brain intakes and responses to stimuli at an accelerated rate, acting as a precognitive ability to sense potential or immediate danger, a kind of "sixth sense" ascribed to Spider-Man. This awareness thus implies some kind of intelligence, capable of parsing Spider-Man's surroundings, identifying and critically evaluating a potential threat at a subconscious level, thus alerting Spider-Man of dangers he cannot readily notice at first, allowing him to effectively dodge and counter incoming attacks in combat, including projectiles aimed at him even from a blind spot. Provided with his extraordinary speed and wall-crawling, the spider-sense is sufficiently well-linked to his superhuman kinesthetics and reflexes, and it permits Spider-Man to evade all manner of spontaneous dangers by an evidently instinctual exercise of some uncanny reflex. It also gives him omnipresent detection to his surroundings, which is how he web swings without looking where he shoots his webs with ease. This was also demonstrated when Parker was able to catch the small cartridge of web fluid tossed to him by Tony Stark, even though he was facing away from him. This ability also doesn't seem to work on individuals Parker doesn't subconsciously consider threats, like his Aunt May. During the Clash of the Avengers, he sensed the bench that Winter Soldier had hurled at him while he fought Falcon. During the Ambush at the Staten Island Ferry, he sensed someone coming his way and, without looking, incapacitated him with a web grenade. Later, he was also able to dodge Vulture's Exo-Suit at full speed, effectively maneuvering in close quarters at a high rate of speed. However, as his enhanced reflexes directly correspond to his sensory input, he can be rendered vulnerable to attacks if his senses are overloaded, such as during his final fight with Vulture. Spider-Man also, despite his incredible reflexes, can be caught by surprise should he allow himself to get distracted, as seen when he was ensnared by Redwing's grapple line due to his excitement during the Clash of the Avengers. While on a bus during a field trip, Parker was able to sense Ebony Maw's Q-Ship descending on New York City, despite being miles away from the site. He is also susceptible to attacks if he does not have sufficient time to elude the attack. After crash-landing the Q-Ship on Titan, Spider-Man was able to sense a threat was going to happen before warning Iron Man and Doctor Strange. His senses had also warned him of his impending demise at the hands of Thanos moments before he began to fade away. When Parker was attempting to explain that Mysterio is a fraud, he sensed the presence of imminent danger, before it physically appeared. Furthermore, Parker's spider-sense outwardly possesses a directional component and can guide him to or away from concealed danger and disguised enemies, such as using his senses to elegantly dodge and attack the invisible Stark Industries Combat Drones that were heading towards him. After Spider-Man defeated all of the drones, when Mysterio gestured the glasses to him, his senses warned him of the real Mysterio cloaked beside him with a gun to his head, allowing him to anticipate Beck's murder attempt, and countered immediately.
