<html><p>Jessica and Trish go to Jessica's apartment with Inez Green in the backseat. Jessica gets out of the car to find the police outside her building. Malcolm tells her to run, as they think she killed him, but the police see her and arrest her for the murder of Cheng's friend.

Family Reunion
Arrested
Jessica making her call to Malcolm Ducasse
Following her arrest, Jones had paced back and forth inside her cell, punching the wall in anger. She is taken into an interrogation room, where she receives counsel from Jeri Hogarth. The police suspect that she’s keeping something from them and have decided to hold her. She later learns from Malcolm Ducasse that all her files have been taken. Ducasse believed that Pryce Cheng must have been casing Jones' apartment when he came to recruit him. She then asks that Ducasse find out everything that Inez Green knows about her former employers and her co-worker who suddenly left the company. Jones had then lastly leaves Ducasse in charge of Alias Investigations while she was away.

Jones and Jeri Hogarth make their statement
Jones and Hogarth agreed to make a statement, but she requires her phone. On it is a photo of Nick Spanos and Whizzer's actual killer. Jones went on to explain that the woman has abilities that far surpass her own. They were both patients at an off-the-grid experimental program called IGH. They tried to heal people using genetic editing, but there were side effects. After giving her statement, Jones and Hogarth remained in the interrogation room as the detectives process what they had just learned. Detectives Eddy Costa and Ruth Sunday returned after running the photo of this mystery woman, though they did not turn up anything. Fortunately, Costa believed her after finding a couple stills that were taken from a network of security cameras in the surrounding area. They were taken just before Spanos’ death. Given her cooperation, Jones was released. Detective Costa then proposed an alliance of sorts as he and several others still remember what Kilgrave had done in the precinct and were grateful to Jones for taking him out.

Stopping Pryce
Jones subdues Pryce Cheng
While talking with her mother in her apartment, Jones was shot by Pryce Cheng from across the street in a neighboring building, though she was not the intended target. It was in fact Alisa that Pryce was after. After failing to kill Alisa, Pryce made a run for it, but he is cut off in the stairwell by Alisa and Jones. Alisa caught up to him on the steps, disarmed him, and threw him up against the wall. Jones exclaimed "mom," to gain her mother's attention and keep her from killing Pryce, who then reached for his gun. However, before he could use it, Jones injected him with a syringe filled with tranquilizer, that rendered Pryce unconscious.

Jones calls the police on her mother
After capturing Pryce, Jones put him in her bathtub and taped his hands and feet. She then took his phone and broke it. The following night, when Pryce finally woke, Jones asked if he remembered trying to kill them. He replied that he was only trying to kill Alisa. Jones then cut him free and took him into a room. She informed him that he could go away for attempted murder. Or they could overlook her kidnapping him and go their separate ways. Once she reminded him that he also shot her, he agreed to her terms. However, he can't look the other way in Alisa's case, as she's a dangerous killer. Pryce convinced Jones that her mother had to be stopped. And so, Jones called detective Costa and reported her mother. Unbeknownst to Jones, Alisa had been listening in. She broke the door down, knocking Jones to the ground and attacked Pryce. Jones held her mom back long enough for Pyrce to make it out the apartment, though physically, she was outmatched. She was beaten to the ground and was only spared when she reminded Alisa of who she was. Alisa then continued her purist of Pryce, however, by the time she made it outside, he was long gone, and NYPD were locked on her, guns drawn.

Finding Vido
Jones agrees to help find Vido
Jones learned from Arocho that Sonia took Vido. When Sonia didn't pick up her phone, Arocho stopped by her place, where her neighbor informed him that Sonia and Vido left with big suitcases. She'd been wanting to take Vido to Peru. Arocho said no, thinking he'd never see his son again. And now, it seemed as if she did just that, so Arocho looked to Jones to find them.

Alisa Jones and Jones search Sonia's apartment
Jones and Alisa met Arocho at Sonia's place. Jones broke the door knob and forced her way into the apartment. She looked for Sonia and Vido's passports, but couldn't find them, which suggested Sonia intended to leave the country. With a custody hearing just a couple weeks off, Arocho blamed himself for not seeing this coming as Sonia's afraid she might lose. Jones discovered that all of Sonia's notices are past due, which meant it might've been difficult for her to get plane tickets. Jones asked if Arocho and Sonia still shared a credit card, which they did. So, he decided to check recent transactions and learned that she just bought two bus tickets.

Jones, Oscar Arocho, and Alisa arrive at the bus station
They arrived at the bus station and realized that she must be taking the nus to Montreal in order to escape the country. Jones ran up and grabbed a kid who she mistook for Vido, apologizing to the parent and child immediately after making the mistake. Jones then had to pull Alisa off of an employee who got smart with Alisa when she asked for directions to the bus to Montreal. Jones and Alisa chased after the bus as it pulled off. Jones grabbed the moving bus by its bumper, an unsuccessful attempt to try and stop it. However, with help from Alisa, between the two of them, they managed to bring the bus to a halt. Arocho reunited with Vido and Jones advised Sonia to be a responsible mother to Vido.

Holiday's Holiday
Jones kills Dale Holiday
Jones began looking into the background of correction captain Dale Holiday after learning that he had been torturing her mother. She started with former co-workers, herself posing as a board member for the New York Board of Prisons. She claimed that they were giving a career achievement award to Holiday and wanted a few colorful anecdotes for their tribute. She learned that Holiday was fired for suspicions of his possible connection to prisoner suicides. As she continued this discussion, Holiday boarded a bus, which Jones followed. She tracked Holiday back to his home. She broke in through the window once he left again. Hidden within a bear's head mounted on the wall, Jones found the patches belonging to the prisoners who allegedly committed suicide. She is then maced by Holiday and beat by a baton. Jones managed to gain control of the situation, grabbing the baton and bashing Holiday on the head, killing him with a single blow.

Encountering Kilgrave
Jones throws Dale Holiday off the roof
After killing Dale Holiday in self-defense, Jones found herself haunted by visions of Kilgrave. In her head, she even heard his voice telling her to stage Dale’s death as a suicide. After cleaning up the mess, Jones staged the scene, writing a suicide note and tossing Holiday's body off the rood. Afterward, Kilgrave appeared and applauded Jones for her actions. He appeared again in the shower with Jones to express his pleasure, caressing her shoulders as she bathed.

Kilgrave continued to harass Jones, bringing up her past of extortion and forgery. And now adding murder to the list of her crimes. Jones attempted to make him go away, but to no avail, as he knew all the quaint side streets of Jessica’s mind. He assured her that not even in her dreams could she escape him and that he’s inside her forever.

Jones goes through Karl Malus' room
He followed Jessica to Karl Malus’ hotel room, where he remarked killing Karl would’ve been much more effective as he laid spread across the bed. He claimed him being there is to simply ease Jessica’s mind. Knowing that Kilgrave was simply a figment of her imagination, she turned her attention back towards finding Karl, to which Kilgrave loan a hand in. He pointed out that the bed was still made, meaning Karl hadn’t slept there and that his coat was still in the closet. They then found Karl’s journal, detailing his plans to make more enhanced individuals. Kilgrave questioned if Jones would kill Malus once she found him.

Jones and Kilgrave have a conversation
Kilgrave rejoined with Jones outside the prison following her visit her with her mother. He agreed that Trish had been acting strange lately, which Jones attributed to drugs. Jones returned home to find Kilgrave in her chair. He antagonized Jones, stating that Karl is safer with Trish considering that she’s not a killer. It’s not in her DNA, but it is in Jones and Kilgrave wanted her to embrace it. Dale Holiday deserved it. Admittedly, so did Kilgrave. Jones opened her laptop to find Malus, only to discover that someone’s been using it. She kicked in Malcolm Ducasse's door to find his apartment empty. In his bed, she finds a pair of sunglasses. Kilgrave remarks that Ducasse and Trish are together. Romantically. He noted that it reminded him of his and Jones’ time together. Jones then opens Ducasse's laptop and a dating app pops up. He sarcastically recommended that Jones sign up.

Jones is upset with Malcolm Ducasse
After finding Ducasse but failing to stop Trish, Malcolm proposed that he and Jones work together to find Trish, but neither knew where she was headed. Kilgrave told Jones that Ducasse should’ve been left in the streets, where Kilgrave put him with a needle in his arm as he’s useless. Kilgrave added that Trish doesn’t want to be saved and that she’s a terrible friend. A second Kilgrave appeared and the two spoke to Jones simultaneously. The delusions only dispersed when Ducasse yelled out to her. Kilgrave then started to belittle Jones, stating that with powers, Trish would be a better hero than she ever was, though he didn’t stop there. He continued to push Jones to embrace her inner killer. She then found herself surrounded by several Kilgraves, all pushing her to become a killer.

Jones does eventually find Trish, but Karl Malus has already began the process to giving her powers, though the process seemed to leave Trish more damaged than anything, to which Kilgrave encouraged Jones to make Malus pay. He told her over and over to do it, but Jones refused.

Jones tells Kilgrave that she is more powerful
Jones sat in the hospital waiting room, where she reminded Kilgrave that she won. Not that he cared, as Malus was dead either way. Nevertheless, he didn’t believe her mother would forgive her for allowing it to happen. However, Jones argued that she’s all her mother needed. Kilgrave continued anger Jones, referring to her once more as a killer and insisting that she’ll kill again. He felt her shutter when she almost killed Malus and it terrified her. Jones admitted that this is true. Because she’s not a killer and she can control herself, meaning she’s more powerful than Kilgrave ever was. He then disappeared. 

Protecting Trish
Jones pleads with her mother to stop
Jones is forced to protect a wounded and unconscious Trish Walker from her mother, who blamed Walker for Karl Malus’ death. Jones entered Walker’s hospital room just as her mother climbed through the window. Alisa looked over to Walker, blaming her for having taken everything from her, though Jones insisted that this was false. She attempted to convince Alisa that this was merely a story she made up in her head, all the while, Jones pulled out a syringe, hoping to subdue her mother. Jones failed to inject her mother with the drugs. Instead, Alisa overpowered her and used Jones’ own body to suffocate Walker. Jones managed to keep Alisa at bay, first punching her then pushing her away. Finally, Jones managed to get through to her mother after pleading with her to stop. Detectives Eddy Costa and Ruth Sunday then barged into the room, guns draw. Alisa attempted to make a break for the window, but is shot in the leg. When Sunday approached to arrest her, Alisa grabbed her and pulled Sunday out the multiple story high window along with her, though Detective Sunday alone hit the ground, as Alisa is nowhere to be seen.

On the Run
Jones is kidnapped by her mother
Jones woke up in Alisa’s camper, parked in the middle of the woods. She recalled her mother attacking her, to which Alisa reasoned was heat of the moment, as she couldn’t allow Jones to turn her in again. Alias then told Jones that they’re in transit to wherever Jones would like to go. Jones wanted to go to The Raft, but Alisa refused, having already wasted much of her life locked up. Alisa then revealed that when she attacked Jones, she showed restrained and controlled it. Alisa wanted to run away with her daughter, though Jones was reluctant. As people approached from the nearby path, Jones told her mother to wait in the vehicle as she wished to protect people from her. As a car approached, Jones begged Alisa to get back inside as she's a wanted woman, and so she did.

Jones is reluctant to join her mother
Jones and Alisa have taken to the road. Alisa found a route out of town via side roads, which would lead them to the boarder. The entire time, Jones eyed the keys in the ignition, which didn’t go unnoticed. Jones realized that Alisa intentionally put her in a bind, where she can neither run nor call the police, leaving Jones without many options. Alisa pointed out that Jones had tried everything but joining her. Alisa wanted to come together with Jones in her mission to find meaning and purpose. Jones exclaimed that she wouldn’t leave Trish Walker, though as Alisa explained, Walker is destroying herself because of Jones. People will always either resent them or idolize them, which included Karl, Alisa added.

Jones saving several civilians
Alisa continued to pitch her idea of her and Jones becoming a team, however, Jones remained reluctant given her mother's murderous past. They suddenly stopped. There had been a car crash ahead of them, in the road, involving a family of three and a truck transporting flammable tanks. Alisa grabbed the young girl out the road while Jones rescued the father, who was stuck in the driver's side. Jones and Alias then lifted the trailer off the mother and carried her to safety. However, the truck driver remained to be rescued. Jones took the mother to the RV while Alisa went to save the man still stuck in his truck. As Jones ran back over to assist, the truck blew up, the explosion knocking Jones off her feet. She got back on her feet and found her mother and the truck driver alive and laying in the grass a few feet away. Jones then hugged her mother closely.

Jones escapes police persecution
Jones and Alisa immediately got back on track. They need to get to the boarder as fast as possible as the cops will be on their trail once the family they saved identifies them. They stop at a restaurant, where Jones met with Oscar to ask for false document papers and to say goodbye, but she is forced to make a run for it after realizing that Oscar was followed by the authorities. Jones returned to her mother and the two headed north. Just eight hours out from Montreal, Jones and Alisa planned their next move, though they aren’t quite sure what that is. They decided to make a detour as they neared a roadblock. They then discovered that the little girl they had previously refused left her phone in the camper and that Detective Eddy Costa was calling from it. Jones called him back. He knew that she was helping her mother and didn’t want to see her get caught up in the crossfire. He informed Jones that she still had a chance to get out, but she didn’t want to hear it, crushing the phone in her hand.

Jones lays on the seat of the ride with her mother's body
That night, Jones and Alisa pulled into a vacant amusement park. Jones found a sailboat at the peer that she wanted to use to escape, but Alisa had another idea in mind. Alisa broke into the amusement park and told Jones to leave without her as she didn't wish to be the cause of Jones' death. Alisa then turned on the ride, the lights of which would attract the cops. Jones and Alisa road the ride to the top, during which time, Alisa revealed to Jones that she no longer wanted to run. As she said her goodbye to Jones, Alisa is shot in the head and killed by Walker. Jones, angered and distraught, jumped off the ride and attacked Walker. She then took Walker’s gun and contemplated killing her, but as the police sirens in the background approached, she let Walker go. Jones returned to the ride, joining her mother, crying alongside her lifeless body. Costa arrived moments later with the NYPD and reassured Jones that she did the right thing, having come to the conclusion that it was her who killed Alisa.

Estrangement
Jones disowns Trish Walker
Some time had passed since her mother’s death, but Jones had not yet gotten over her passing. She had been ignoring Trish's calls and texts, until she returned home one day to find Trish waiting at her door. She explains to Jessica that she didn't want the situation to go down the way it did at the amusement park, but it had to be done. Jessica argued the opposite. Trish believed that she had to kill Alisa because Jones wouldn’t, blinded by the fact that she was her mother. Walker again reminded Jones that they’re sisters. Jessica believes she lost the only bits of family she had, again, only seeing Trish as the person who killed her mother. She then shut the door in her face.

Business as Usual
For the next few months, Jones returned to a normal life at Alias Investigations. During this time, she saved a woman from her abusive spouse at a furniture factory and hired Gillian as her new secretary. Walker tried to get back in touch with her while beginning her own career as a vigilante, with little success.

A Free Trip to Mexico
Not long after, Jones was contacted by Eddy Costa, who offered her a case in the form of an Amber Alert, stating that Mitch Yasdan had kidnapped his daughter Cassie and taken her to Mexico. Jones traveled there and confronted Yasdan, who had lost custody. He insisted that he had a terrible lawyer and needed to get Cassie away from her mother as she was toxic. Cassie also wished to stay with her dad, but Jones ignored this, pointing out that he had still broken the law. When Yasdan argued that they were no longer under US jurisdiction, Jones replied that they were about to be. Not aware of her powers, Yasdan threatened to get physical. Seconds later, Jones threw him across the beach. This was caught on camera and went viral.

Jones returned Cassie to Mrs. Yasdan, who thanked her. Mrs. Yasdan then expressed her anger at Mitch and resolved to have him put in prison and deny him visitation rights. Jones suggested she let the matter slide for Cassie. Mrs. Yasdan immediately took offense to this, demanding to know if Jones thought she was unfair to her daughter. Jones clarified that she was talking about the situation, but her client was unconvinced. She proceeded to accuse Jones of exploiting her for a free trip to Mexico, displaying signs of victim mentality. She also refused to hire Jones for any future cases after that.

Jeri's Dilemma
Jones got a call from Hogarth, who was in need of her assistance. When Jones arrived at Hogarth's apartment, she shared with Jones her plan for the future. In her hand, she held the pill bottle from her night stand. Everyday, she asked herself if today was the day she would finally take them. The answer had been no, until that morning, when she felt the first significant symptoms of the ALS, though the symptoms did pass. However, it made her realize that when the day came for her to finally take them, she wouldn't have it in her to do it herself. So she would need someone to slip her the pills without her knowing, and she wanted that to be Jones. However, Jones was reluctant.

Stakeout at the Hotel Nouvet
Jones began an investigation after being hired by Dorothy Walker to find Trish Walker. She tracked her down to Nouvet Hotel, where Walker had been staking out the building next door. While waiting for Walker to return, Jones remained in her hotel room. As night approached, Jones spotted Walker on the street below, following a man into his apartment. Jones watched from the hotel room as Walker began to attack him. Just as he gained the upper hand, Jones came to save her, crashing through the man's window as he pulled out a gun and began firing. Jones disarmed the man and retreated into the bedroom with Walker, who exhibited impressive reflexes and agility before returning to the main room, only to discover that the man and the sculpture that Walker was after, was gone. Walker then jumped out the window and returned to her hotel room, with Jones not far behind.

Jones confronted Walker, referring to her as a cat burglar, but Walker was simply trying to get justice. Jones realized that what she saw Walker doing earlier must've meant that Karl Malus' procedure worked. Because of Jones, the man got away. The sculpture in his safe would've linked him to an assault. Walker had been tracking him for weeks. She was just trying to be the hero she always wanted to be, and Jones mocked her for it. Jones questioned if it was all worth it to Walker considering that she got what she always wanted. Walker countered that she freed Jones from her responsibilities of helping people, because she can do that now. Before leaving, Jones told Walker that her mother was looking for her.

Meeting Erik Gelden
Jones met a guy at a bar, one with whom she made a bet with, though she lost, costing her $10. The man joked he had an instinct for idiocy. It was people like the idiots at the bar that he had never cared for, though Jones couldn’t say the same. According to her mother, she cared. He could tell from the look on Jones' face that her mother was dead, to which he offered his condolences. The man continued to share his view of the world with Jones, how everything was terrible and optimism was a lie. He accepted reality and proceeded accordingly. The two of them toasted to having low expectations. Jones then received her burger she ordered, which the man would not allow her to eat as it was waste. Jones read him as a con artist, but he claimed to be a motivational speaker. He was very much aware of who Jones was and what she was capable of, yet he continued, even offering to make her a burger of his own, that he bet $50 she would enjoy. Jones decided to take him up on the offer.

They stopped by the store and then headed upstairs to her place, where he introduced himself as Erik as they kissed. They were interrupted by a knock at the door. Jones suspected it was Vido Arocho, but as she opened the door, she was stabbed by someone wearing a black ski mask. Jones, bleeding and wounded, shoved her assailant down the hall. She fell to the ground, and her attacker escaped. Fortunately, Malcolm Ducasse came out his apartment and tended to Jones as he called the police.

Hospitalized
Jones laid in the hospital bed, pale and weak. Walker looked over her and asked how she was feeling. Jones had just gotten out of surgery, but wanted the name of her attacker. More specifically, of the man Walker was after, as Jones suspected that her attack was directly connected to Brandt, Walker’s suspect, who must’ve recognized Jones when she came crashing through his window. It was then that Walker realized Jones had only called her down to get the name of her attacker, and so she left.

Jones, all alone in the room, examined her wound, discovering that her spleen was removed. The doctor informed her that if she was a normal human then her injuries would’ve been fatal. Jones had her sights set on Brandt and didn’t care much for what the doctor had to say. She attempted to stand as she wanted to be discharged, but she found herself too weak to move, and was helped back onto the bed by the doctor.

Jones awakened from her sleep. Startled by her nightmare, she kicked detective Eddy Costa as he approached, unaware of who he was initially. He was there to take her statement, though Jones wouldn’t offer up much and refused to look at herself or even be treated as a victim. Later, Jones was discharged against medical advice. Still weak and wounded from her attack, Jones limped and wobbled her way home.

Finding Andrew Brandt
Jones ordered Gillian to find out everything she could about Andrew Brandt, but she was off the clock. Before leaving, she informed Jones that Vido Arocho stopped by to give her a gift and she then gave Jones her medication. In her refrigerator, Jones found the burger that Erik Gelden had made for her. Unbeknownst to the two of them, Jones and Trish Walker were simultaneously studying the same case, looking into Brandt. Jones fell asleep at her desk. She only woke when Malcolm Ducasse knocked at the door. She thanked him for calling the ambulance and he gave her the knife that she was stabbed with. He swiped it before police arrived. He called in a favor and ran the prints. The knife was clean and too common to trace. He figured Jones would say that she didn’t need any favors, so he billed her to his services.

Jones is met by Trish Walker in the apartment
Jones broke into Brandt's apartment and looked through his home for any clues. Walker was there as well, though she didn’t come up with any leads. Brandt was her target first, and she wanted to be the one to bring him in, though Jones wanted vengeance after he stabbed her. Walker was concerned that Jones would take this from her. She advised Jones to go home and take care of herself, and to allow her to handle Brandt. Before Jones’ intervention, Walker intended to take Brandt to the police, but Jones knew this was not Walker's goal.

Jones scolds Walker's views of being a hero
Jones made a series of calls regarding potential auctions for the stolen sculpture, but each call led nowhere. However, she did get the names of galleries to survey from Hogarth. The following day, Jones broke into the Cassaro Gallery auction. She walked around the building to the back alley and jumped up onto the roof and found the sculpture inside. Unfortunately, Walker was at the auction as well, posing as a buyer. She hacked into their computer and took a photo of their sellers’ contact information. Outside, Jones waited for Walker. Jones wanted Brandt’s contact info and Walker wanted the sculpture. Jones took Walker down and called Brandt from Walker’s phone, posing as an assistant for the gallery. She informed him that his lot had sold and asked where he’d like the check delivered.

Jones broke into Brandt’s hideout and took his gun. He was visibly afraid, telling her to take whatever she wanted, though Jones wasn’t interested. She pinned Brandt to the wall with a car. He suspected that Jones was hired by his sister, however, Jones informed him that she couldn’t care less about the sculpture. She was angry that he hired someone to stab him. Brandt claimed that he did no such thing. He’d been hiding out ever since she and Walker broke into his apartment. On top of that, he didn’t have anyone to hire as no one would risk pissing off a couple of supers. Realizing that he was telling the truth, Jones pulled the car off of him. She then called Walker and told her that Brandt wasn’t her attacker and gave the location to find him.

Team up with Trish
Jones called into Style by Trish. She claimed that she was calling about the sweater that Walker had previously tried to sell her. Jones had changed her mind and wanted to buy it. The clingy, smothering, and tenacious sweater. The one that wouldn't quit even when she asked it to. Lastly, Jones said that she needed Walker’s help to stop Gregory Sallinger, to which Walker was more than happy to.

Jones and Walker began their joint investigation into Sallinger at Jones' apartment, starting with the bag full of bloody money Sallinger left behind. There was $8,000 in the bag total. Walker was certain they’d catch him, but Jones knew just how smart he was. They didn’t have any kind of evidence to support their claim that Sallinger was a murderer. So, they planned a stakeout. Jones wanted to get him the right way, without the risk of losing the case to coercion, as suggested by Walker who wanted to dangle him off a roof. Walker was their one advantage as Sallinger wasn’t yet aware of her.

Jones and Walker staged their stakeout on top of the neighboring building to Sallinger’s apartment. Jones explained to Walker that Sallinger was a wrestling coach at the community center and his brother died in an accident. Sallinger had been living off of that ever since. Walker remained on top of the building to cover the front while Jones headed around to cover the back.

Walker called Jones to alert her of Sallinger’s arrival. She watched through binoculars as he pulled out his bag what appeared to be photos. He then pulled a bureau away from the wall and added the photo to a hidden album. Jones suspected it could be a trophy. Walker wanted to break in and get it, but Jones already had an established plan. Sallinger exited the building, providing Walker with a window of time to get in, get the album, and get out. During which time, Jones would follow Sallinger. The power went out in Sallinger’s building moments before Walker broke in. She pulled the bureau away from the wall and found the hidden album. She took photos on her phone of the album and put it back.

Meeting Berry
Jones followed Sallinger. He stopped by a park bench, where he read a newspaper. Across the street from Sallinger, an altercation ensued between Gor, a pimp, and one of his hookers, Berry. Not long after, Gelden arrived. He and Sallinger had a brief exchange of words, before Gelden approached Gor and handed him some money. Gelden then took Berry inside a nearby hotel, which Jones followed them into. Jones entered the hotel room to the sight of Berry fighting Gelden, who explained that Brianna, or as she preferred to be called, Berry, was his sister. Jones accused Gelden of being in cahoots with Sallinger, however, he explained that this wasn’t the case. He was trying to get Brianna some place safe and Sallinger got to her first. What Jones saw was Sallinger questioning how Gelden found him. Gelden stated that Sallinger slipped up, but it was he who left broken pieces for Sallinger to find, and now he was threatening Gelden’s sister. That’s why Gelden was out there. Sallinger was the first person to ever make him. Normally, he’d give Brianna as much space as she needed, but not with Sallinger knowing who he was. As Brianna tried to leave, he attempted to explain that she wasn’t safe out there.

Jones returned home to find Walker and Gillian researching together. They found something, but Jones didn’t stick around to find out what it was. Instead, she approached Ducasse with a job. To house and protect Brianna. Initially reluctant, Ducasse eventually agreed. He deduced that they wanted to keep Brianna close by because she was Erik’s sister. Ducasse then asked for the specifics, such as who he’d be protecting her from. Erik revealed to Jones that Ducasse was giving him a headache. A three on a scale from 1-10. Jones, however, decided to trust her gut over Erik’s head.

The Trainyard Trap
Jones joined Walker up on the rooftop, where Walker informed her that Sallinger was sleeping. Jones showed Walker the photo she had taken of Sallinger’s closet and the photo that Walker had taken. In one photo, the handsaw hanging in his closet was missing, but it was back in place in the later photo. That connected with something Walker had been thinking about; the vacuum seal bags she found in his apartment. He must've used them to store body parts. Jones had an idea on how to find them, but she needed Walker to get in contact with Maury at the morgue. They would need to borrow something. They lured Sallinger out of his home by throwing a severed hand through his window. Sallinger would in turn return what he believed to be the hand of one of his victim's back to his burial site.

Jones met up with Walker near the train tracks, where she had tracked Sallinger. They caught up to Sallinger who had opened the lid to one of the tanks. They suspected that was where he kept the bodies, but Jones wanted proof. She would investigate while Walker followed Sallinger. Jones climbed on top and entered the tank. Once inside, she found dozens of body parts. However, the tank was booby trapped. Jones tripped the line, which caused the door to lock and the tank to fill with some type of poisonous gas. Jones punched the tank until her hands bled, but she was too weak to break through. Jones, unfortunately, was running out of time. She could barely stand, using the ladder to hold herself up. Luckily, Walker came back for her. She pried the door open and rescued Jones. When asked if she lost Sallinger, Walker replied that she chose Jones.

Jones, still coughing from the attack, thanked Walker for saving her. Walker then admitted that she wished she didn’t kill Alisa. Jones said she wished her mother wasn’t a mass murderer. The police were approaching as Jones had reported her discovery of the bodies. However, Walker had to leave as they needed her anonymity.

Rescuing Erik
Jones and Trish Walker began their search for Erik Gelden, who had been taken by Gregory Sallinger. Sallinger wanted to know from Jones how they found him. Jones offered to come and explain every mistake Sallinger made if he gave up his location. However, he did no such thing.

Jones rushed over to Sallinger’s apartment, where police were all over the scene. So, she circled around back. However, Costa caught her before she could climb up the fire escape. They had an APB out on Sallinger, his phone was being tracked, his neighbors were being canvassed, and the feds were coming in. Still, Jones had to take action and needed to know what Costa had so far, but they didn’t have much of anything. He asked Jones about the photos behind the bureau. It was full of landscape photos, meaning Sallinger cleaned it out. Initially, it had photos of his eight victims. Costa corrected Jones and told her there were only seven victims according to the coroner. And they’d identified them all. Jones offered to trade Costa the copies of the photos from the album for the list of victim’s names. If she knew which photo wasn’t on the list, she could find the eighth victim. As there was another officer present, Costa said no to the trade, but as he was walking off, he intentionally dropped the list for Jones.

Jones reconvened with Walker and together they discussed how to find Gelden. When she called his phone, Jones recalled him yelling out that he was in a commercial something, before Sallinger cut him off. Whatever it was, it would have to be abandoned for Sallinger to do his work.

After finding her eighth man, Jones just needed a name, so she broke into Ducasse's apartment as she assumed that he had facial recognition software considering his current employment, which he did. They got a hit. A 96% match. Caspar Marx. He was a well-known chef, who was apparently still alive. As Jones was headed out to follow the lead, she met Berry Gelden at the door, who asked if they had found Erik yet. They hadn’t, but she assured Berry they would.

Jones questioned Marx and from him learned that Sallinger was holding Gelden at Marx's old restaurant, which had since been closed down. Jones and Walker arrived just in time to save Gelden. After kicking Sallinger over the counter, Jones tended to Gelden. In that time, Sallinger got to his feet and took cover, though Walker was looking for him. Sallinger circled around and charged at Jones with a knife. She knocked him back. Then Walker disarmed him and the two of them knocked him out. Walker disposed of the photos Sallinger took of Gelden and then took him back to Alias. Jones stayed behind to make sure the police got Sallinger. Unfortunately, Jones would later learn that the charges wouldn't stick and that Sallinger would walk free.

Road to Wappinger Falls
Gregory Sallinger’s press conference was gaining a lot of attention and the phones were going off the hook at Alias Investigations, with people asking about the second vigilante. Jones looked into Sallinger’s past to see if he may have slipped up. She looked into his brother’s death, which was allegedly a tractor accident. Jones suspected that this may not have been an accident at all and that Donny Sallinger was Sallinger’s first kill, so she and Trish Walker decided to drive out to his home town.

Jones and Walker drove to Wappinger Falls to uncover the truth behind Donny Sallinger’s death. Jones entered the police precinct and requested the report. Chief Ronnie Velasco confirmed that Donny was rolled over by the tractor and that Gregory was on a school trip. When Jones questioned why Velasco wouldn’t show her the report, she called Jones out, as she was aware of who Jones was. Velasco denied that Sallinger had any involvement in the death of his brother or the seven victims in the train yard. With Velasco refusing to show her the report, Jones went into the restroom, where she texted Walker and told her to cause a distraction, which she did by making her car alarm sound off. Once the officers were outside looking to help Walker, Jones hopped the counter and stole Donny’s report.

Jones and Walker spent the night in a nearby motel. With no foul play detected, Walker began to worry that they were wrong about Donny being Sallinger's first kill. After briefly thinking over her role as a cover, Walker recalled when it came out that she as a drug addict, four-time rehab failure. It was a moment of relief for her. She could finally breathe and be herself. Moving back to the case, they wondered if Donny wasn’t the first kill, then who was.

Meeting the Silvas
The following morning, Trish Walker presented Jones with a lead. Nathan Silva was on the high school wrestling team. Silva and Sallinger were friends up until senior year when he went missing.

Jones and Trish Walker arrive at the Silva Residence
Jones and Walker arrived at the Silva Residence. Their son had been missing for fifteen years, and Jones was about to rip that wound open. Inside the Silva home, Manuel Silva told Jones that Nathan and Sallinger had one falling out when Nathan started getting recruiting offers. Sallinger was envious as wresting came easy to Nathan. Jones noticed a card with a photo of Nathan on the stand. It read "Nathan will always be with you." Sallinger sent it the Christmas after Nathan went missing. The photo was taken in the backyard, where a gazebo sat. It was built the day Nathan disappeared. The whole team helped out. Manuel thought that Nathan had just skipped out on the work. Ana Silva, Nathan’s mother, was done answering questions as it brought too much pain.

Jones discovers Nathan Silva's body
Jones, looking outside to the gazebo, asked if Sallinger helped build it. He did. He stayed the entire day, Manuel said. Chief Velasco entered the home after getting a call from Ana. Velasco told Jones to leave, instead, Jones headed out back. Jones flipped the gazebo and started digging into the dirt. Velasco drew her weapon and demanded Jones stop digging or else she would shoot. Walker came around back and started filming Velasco. Just as Jones suspected, she found Nathan’s body buried beneath the dirt.

Jones and Walker depart the Silva Residence
As Nathan’s body was taken away, Jones called Costa and told him that Silva was Salliger's first kill. There’d have to be DNA all over it. And so, Costa would have to file for jurisdiction over the body. Velasco approached and asked for her files back. She then thanked Jones.

Queen of the Ring
Malcolm Ducasse stalked Gregory Sallinger all the way to the community center. He watched from outside the gym as Sallinger taught a wrestling class. Jones arrived soon thereafter, after tracing Ducasse’s phone. Jones informed Ducasse that they found what they needed upstate to get Sallinger. Although, they couldn't bring him in quite yet. Sallinger noticed Jones watching him from outside the door and invited her in, though Ducasse remained hidden. Jones wanted him away from the kids he was teaching, but he refused. Sallinger told Jones that she had no discipline and couldn’t control herself. Jones realized that he was baiting her to attack him in front of cameras. Instead, she got on the mat and told him to school her.

After Sallinger explained the ground rules to Jones, the match began and Sallinger slammed Jones to the mat. As he laid on top of her, she mentioned Silva, which got a reaction from Sallinger, who she proceeded to toss several feet back. Sallinger charged for her, but she dodged the attack. Sallinger charged again and Jones slammed him. Jones then went on the offense and slammed him again, before leaving. The crowd cheered as Jones exited.

Sending a Message
After Trish Walker failed to answer her calls, Jones stopped by the studio to talk to her in person. Jones showed Dorothy the photo from the Bulletin of Walker in her disguise, on the bridge. Dorothy was upset that Walker went down this path without her. Both she and Jones could use her support, Dorothy believed. Jones then got a video message from Sallinger from a cafe, where he stated that by 7:00 pm, a life would end because of Jones and everyone would see that she was a fraud. While Sallinger was supposed to be under police surveillance, he must’ve slipped them. Jones made Walker aware of this. The camera from the video was focused on a table, where two men and a woman sat. Given that all his past victims were male, Walker concluded that his next victim must be one of the two men at the table. The video then seemed to erase itself. Dorothy explained that it was an InstaYap video, which only allowed two viewings.

Costa pulled up as Jones reached Sallinger’s apartment. He warned her to walk away as Sallinger hadn’t gone anywhere, but Jones had her doubts. Jones and Costa knocked on the door to find that Sallinger was gone. He hired Joby, who informed them that he answered a job posting. $200 to sit and watch tv on Sallinger’s couch. Jones revealed to Costa that this was the result of her rubbing in his face that she found out about Nathan Silva. Jones told Costa to leave while she stayed behind to force Sallinger to communicate with her. Jones sent Sallinger a video of her in his apartment, mocking him and destroying his trophies and degrees.

Jones and Walker told Gillian to pull up a satellite view of Hudson Street Market. Jones got a response video from Sallinger of him following one of the guys from the cafe. He called Jones a fraud and claimed by 7:00 that night, everyone would know it. Knowing that the video would disappear after playing it a second time, Jones recorded the video with another phone. While he may have still been in Manhattan, Walker and Jones didn’t see either of the men from Hudson Market. However, Jones noticed the women who was from the first video. He was changing his MO to a proxy for Jones.

Jones called Dorothy over as she wished to have an interview. Walker narrowed the location from the second video to a couple streets in Tribeca. Jones recalled what Sallinger said to her, that her "hero charade will end where it began." However, that was nowhere near Tribeca. There were also no cobblestone streets near Jones’ childhood home, the Jersey Turnpike or the old IGH building. Before heading out to begin the interview, Dorothy briefly coached Jones.

Jones’ live interview with Thembi Wallace started. Walker watched on her laptop from the bedroom. Jones insisted that she wasn’t a super hero, even if she had squared off with super powered people like Kilgrave and the female serial murderer last year. And now, she was after Sallinger, regardless of powers. Jones revealed that she only agreed to hold the interview to spread the word of Sallinger hunting a woman. The same killer who chopped up seven victims. Jones showed a screenshot of the woman from the video to warn her. She then showed Sallinger’s photo. Wallace accused Jones of provoking the killer, along with teaming up with the masked vigilante, who was wanted for questioning. Jones replied in typical fashion, causing Dorothy to cut the interview short. She and Jones then returned to the bedroom with Walker, where Dorothy assured them that the interview was a success as they would be playing that clip all day long, on every platform.

Jones and Walker hit the streets of Tribeca, showing around the photo of the mystery woman. By night fall, they had no leads. With 7:00 approaching, they grew more and more concerned. Jones noticed a GT Agrochemical building. Her family crashed into their delivery truck, which began Jones "hero charade." Jones and Walker rushed towards the building as this must’ve been where Sallinger was leading them. Meanwhile, Sallinger, put on his ski mask and prepared to make his move.

Jones and Walker entered the building and asked the man at the front desk if he had seen the woman in the photo. He thought he recognized her, mentioning the name Mona Lee. Pavel led them into the garage, where they were attacked by three guards, who Jones and Walker disposed of rather quickly. When the guards recognized them, Jones and Walker decided to let them go. They heard a clattering sound in the distance. They followed it to Mona Lee, who revealed that it was indeed her in the photo. They told Lee that there was a serial killer after her and that they were there to protect her.

However, Jones discovered that Lee wasn't a target after all. Jones returned to her apartment and rewatched the video Sallinger sent her. Sallinger said something about Jones’ hero charade ending where it began. Jones got her powers in the accident that killed her family. Walker was the only family she had left. Jones then came to a realization.

Assassination of Dorothy Walker
Walker arrived at her mother's home to find the door open and her mother bleeding and tied to a chair. Walker screamed for help as she untied her mother only to find that she was dead. The phone rang. It was Jones calling to warn Dorothy. Walker answered and told Jones that her mother was dead. Jones and Ducasse then headed over to Dorothy’s, calling the cops as they left. Walker demanded that Sallinger pay. Knowing that she intended to go after Sallinger, Jones ran over to his apartment, where she found two officers wounded just outside the building. Jones climbed up the fire escape and entered the apartment, where she found Walker attacking a beaten and bloody Sallinger. Walker, with a knife in hand, was moments away from slicing Sallinger’s throat. Jones, hoping to stop her from making this mistake, rushed her.

Sallinger's Deal
Jones got a message from Sallinger. An image of Walker holding a blade to his throat. However, Jones chose to keep this from her.

Jones, dressed in scrubs, took possession of Sallinger as he laid wounded in his hospital bed. Sallinger told Jones that it was supposed to be her that came after him. He was trying to capture her true nature. Sallinger wanted to stay out of prison, for which he would need Jones’ help. He could tell that Jones was terrified of losing Walker, as she was all Jones had left. He wanted her to destroy any evidence on Nathan Silva’s body that could be traced back to him or else that picture of Walker attacking him would be released. Jones reluctantly agreed, but not without threatening Sallinger should he not follow through on his end.

Jones and Erik Gelden stood in the darkened corner near the grocery store waiting for officer Carl Nussbaumer. He stopped there every night at the start of his beat. He served 20 decorated years on the force, but he was also a murderer. Gelden found three uncleared homicides on Nussbaumer’s watch. All drug dealers, all chalked up to street crimes. He stole their product and cash afterward. Some of which he used to pay Gelden $10,000 in blackmail money. Jones approached the officer and confronted him about his murderous behavior. He turned off his body cam and called Jones out, as he recognized her from the news. All Jones wanted from him was access to the crime lab in Jamaica, Queens. A clear path of entry, in and out, without a trace. Gelden roughed officer Nussbaumer up against the fence after he threatened Jones. She forced Nussbaumer to find her a way in or else she would expose him. Nussbaumer’s shift ended at 2:00 am. He told Jones to be at the lab’s loading dock at 2:45. As he left, Gelden explained to Jones that it was worse than before. Nussbaumer was still at it.
