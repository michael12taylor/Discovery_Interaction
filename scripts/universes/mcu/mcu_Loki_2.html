<html><p>With the Avengers and Thor now considering themselves to be allies in the war, they took Loki together into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody aboard the Helicarrier. As armed guards marched Loki down the hallways and past Bruce Banner's laboratory, Loki smiled at the scientist, making Banner uneasy and raising suspicion all round. Loki was placed in a confinement capsule which had been designed, without Banner's knowledge, to hold a rogue Hulk. If Loki tried to escape or break through the cell, it would drop him 30,000 feet straight downward, which would hopefully be fatal to him.

Loki is personally interrogated by Nick Fury
Loki taunted Nick Fury about his failed attempts to understand and control the Tesseract and his gathering of misfits to defend Earth. However, Fury remained confident and told the God of Mischief that he had made him very desperate and he might live to regret this. Loki went on to tell Fury that he had finally seen what real power was and Fury took this as a cue to leave. Loki's mere presence and self-confidence was enough to provide a disruptive element that would fragment the only group of heroes that had any hope of stopping him.

Tricked by Black Widow
Loki speaking with and testing Black Widow
As Loki paced in his cell, he was greeted by Black Widow who came to apparently offer a deal in exchange for Clint Barton's freedom. Loki subjected her to a play of wits where he asked her questions about her past and her relationship with Barton. Eventually, Loki ferreted out her deeper misgivings and explained that Barton had told him all about her murders and terrible crimes she had committed while a part of the Red Room before she joined S.H.I.E.L.D., making a reference to Antonia Dreykov, the daughter of General Dreykov who Black Widow and Barton had killed in an attempt to assassinate the General.

Loki threatening Black Widow from in his cell
Loki vowed that he would force Barton to torture and kill Romanoff in order to break his heart before he broke his skull, taking considerable pleasure at the horror this put in Romanoff. However, she tricked the trickster into revealing that there was already a monster among them and that it was not him. From this, she concluded that the monster was Banner and that Loki planned to use Hulk to destroy the Helicarrier and the heroes as well. Once she left to warn them, Loki's smile indicated that was part of his plan: to turn Hulk against the Avengers by first turning the Avengers against Hulk.

Attack on the Helicarrier
Loki smiles, while he hears Hulk's rampage
However, Loki's plan to use Hulk was only one aspect of his real intentions. More of his full scheme became clear as another jet carrying Hawkeye and the rogue agents came to his aid, following a signal from the Scepter. Hawkeye caused a massive explosion which separated the Avengers. The wounded Banner transformed into Hulk and went on a rampage, destroying much of the Helicarrier while Loki remained in his cell and smiled to himself at the destruction.

Loki tricking and entrapping his brother Thor
Before long one of Loki's controlled agents freed him from the cell. Loki then used illusions of himself to trick Thor into entering the cell, trapped him in there, and mocked his brother for falling for the same trick yet again. Before Loki could drop the cell from the Helicarrier in order to kill his brother, Agent Phil Coulson confronted him with the Destroyer Armor Prototype Gun and politely ordered him to move away from the controls and surrender, noting that he was not sure exactly how powerful the gun really was.

Loki prepares to drop Thor out from the sky
Loki used his illusions to get behind the brave S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and stabbed him straight through the heart with his Scepter. Thor watched in horror as Coulson fell to the ground dying. Loki looked his brother straight in the eye as he returned to the control pad, and ejected Thor - in the cell Fury made for disposing of a dangerous Hulk - to fall thousands of feet from the Helicarrier to his eventual death.

Loki mocks a mortally wounded Phil Coulson
As Coulson lay on the ground bleeding to death, he summoned the strength to tell Loki that he stood no chance of winning this war. Loki claimed he had no disadvantage as the Avengers had been destroyed, only for Coulson to fire the Destroyer Gun at him, sending him flying through a wall. Though he retrieved his Scepter, Black Widow released Hawkeye from the mind control, and Loki got on-board a Quinjet and headed to New York City, where Erik Selvig waited with the Tesseract at Stark Tower where they intended to complete their experiments.

Battle of New York
Tony Stark's Challenge
Loki watches as Iron Man locates him
While Erik Selvig continued his work on the roof of the skyscraper, Loki prepared to welcome his army of Chitauri and begin his glorious, but brief, war on the Earth. Iron Man, having survived the Attack on the Helicarrier and having figured out his plans, caught up with him at Stark Tower. Loki watched confidently as Stark landed on the Tower's landing pad and abandoned his wrecked Iron Man suit, stepping inside the building in order to confront and threaten the God of Mischief personally.

Loki is threatened by Tony Stark
Stark offered Loki a drink while he claimed that once the Chitauri arrived nothing could stop him. He asked Stark what he had to fear: Stark told him that he should fear the Avengers as together the team would be a strong force against him. Loki mocked the claim, noting that in their first bout he had already driven them apart, but Stark insisted he had just pissed them off and that if they couldn't protect the Earth, they would Avenge its destruction at Loki's hand. He also promised that Hulk was stronger than Loki and his entire army combined, much to Loki's great annoyance.

Loki tries and fails to brainwash Tony Stark
When Loki grew weary of the threats noted that the Avengers would soon be too busy fighting Stark to challenge him as he attempted to subjugate Stark with the Scepter, only to be physically blocked by the Arc Reactor in Stark's chest, leading to Stark mock him even further for the awkward failure. Annoyed at the insults, Loki threw the inventor out of a window and was surprised when a freshly built Iron Man armor rocketed after him. Loki found himself under attack when the fully suited Iron Man rocketed back up to retaliate and, avenging Agent Phil Coulson, knocked him back with an energy blast.

Loki looks at the Battle of New York
Before they could continue the fight, the Tesseract opened the portal in the sky, finally allowing Loki's entire Chitauri army to come pouring through beginning the Chitauri Invasion of Earth. As Iron Man left Loki to begin battling the oncoming army as he shot them out of the sky singlehandedly, Loki recovered himself and took a moment to enjoy the moment. With his triumph near at hand, Loki stepped out onto the observation tower on Stark Tower, regained his full armor and watched as New York City burned around him, lifting his arms up and smiling at all of the devastation he had now caused.

Showdown with Thor
Loki furiously jumps forward to attack Thor
Loki was confronted by Thor who had survived his fall from the Helicarrier and demanded that he deactivate the Tesseract or the God of Thunder would destroy it. Loki refused, claiming that nothing could stop his war. The brothers fought for a second time, Loki's Scepter matching Thor's hammer. Blasts from the gem almost completely destroyed the Stark Tower logo on the side of the balcony, blasting some of the giant letters and debris off the side.

Loki fighting Thor on top of Stark Tower
The two continued to battle as Loki shot down a Quinjet carrying the other Avengers. When the confrontation came to stalemate with them grappling each others' necks, Thor urged Loki to look around him at the destruction he had caused and asked if he truly believed it would all end with his rule. Loki was unsure of himself; he claimed it was too late to stop the madness, but briefly considered Thor's appeal to working together to end it all and redeem himself.

Thor tries and fails to convince Loki to stop
The will of the Tesseract over his mind was stronger than his guilt, however, and Loki instead stabbed Thor in the stomach with a throwing knife, preparing to strike him down with the Scepter as he knelt before him and laughing in amusement at Thor's sentiment. This did little more than enrage Thor, who disarmed Loki of his staff before hitting him repeatedly in the face, soon beating Loki into submission before picking him up over his head and slamming him down hard onto the ruined balcony.

Loki rides a Chitauri Chariot into battle
Not allowing himself to be defeated and captured so early into the Chitauri Invasion, Loki threw himself off the building and landed on one of the Chitauri Chariots. From there, Loki took command of the attack on the New York City, shooting down at the humans, destroying many cars and killing dozens of innocent people in massive explosions. The Avengers meanwhile put all their might into attempting to stop him and protect the lives of the people trapped in the city.

Humiliating Defeat
Loki amused by the effort to kill him
When Hulk destroyed the first of the Chitauri's massive Leviathans, Loki commanded the Chitauri on the other side of the still-open portal to send the rest of their massive armada, releasing dozens of Leviathans and hundreds more Chitauri soldiers, overwhelming New York City's defenses. An aerial chase in which Loki chased down Black Widow left his craft destroyed when Loki confidently caught one of Hawkeye's arrows, which then exploded, causing him to crash land back on Stark Tower.

Loki is brutally attacked by Hulk
Just as Loki got to his feet ready to return to the fight, Hulk confronted him and punched him through a wall into the main room. Loki leaped to his feet and demanded that he stop, claiming that as an Asgardian God, he was vastly superior and would not be bullied by him. Loki's frustrated rant only goaded Hulk into simply picking him up and repeatedly slamming him into the ground, catching him entirely off-balance. Loki, too stunned to fight or threaten any longer, just lay on the ground, more wounded physically than he had ever been before.

Aftermath
Loki is finally defeated by the Avengers
Barely able to move from the beating he had received from Hulk, Loki eventually summoned the strength to crawl only to find himself face to face with the Avengers, who had defeated the Chitauri army and closed the Tesseract's portal. As Black Widow held the Scepter and Hawkeye aimed an arrow directly at his face, Loki accepted his defeat and quietly requested the drink that Tony Stark had offered before. The Avengers ignored his request and took him into custody.

Loki waves to Hulk
While he was being bound in handcuffs, Loki mockingly transformed into Captain America, only to be silenced by Thor who placed a metal muzzle on his mouth, as Loki's Scepter was taken into STRIKE's possession. When Hulk wasn't allowed to board the elevator due to its weight capacity and was told to use the stairs, Loki smugly waved farewell at the enraged Hulk.

Loki is taken into custody by the Avengers
As the Avengers were escorting Loki out of the Stark Tower, they were stopped by Alexander Pierce and a group of HYDRA operatives that were disguised as S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Pierce had attempted to negotiate the custody of Loki for his crimes against humanity, and the Tesseract. Pierce's interference led to a heated discussion with Thor and Stark, while Loki merely watched the events unfold in front of him.

Loki about to be transported back to Asgard
However, Nick Fury ultimately allowed Thor to take Loki and the Tesseract back to Asgard, knowing that both would be better there than on Earth. Thus, Loki was led to an open area in Central Park with his brother. From there, Thor said goodbye to the Avengers and used the power of the Tesseract to transport both of them back home to Asgard, where he would face Asgardian justice at the hands of Odin.

Imprisoned
Loki is eventually reunited back with Frigga
Following the failure of the Chitauri, Loki was now in the custody of Thor who proceeded to bring him back to Asgard where Loki was forced in chains to face Odin's justice for his many crimes. Upon arriving for his trial, Loki then greeted Frigga and asked if he had finally made her proud, as Frigga begged Loki not to make the situation any worse, although Loki joked that it could not get worse.

Loki being brought before Odin in chains
Odin, however, demanded they stop speaking and had ordered Loki to step forward, as Loki still continued making light of the situation, banging his chains together and claiming that he did not see what all the fuss was about. Loki then tried to justify his actions on Earth by claiming it wanted to rule over the Humans as a god, comparing this to what Odin and all the other Asgardians had done for thousands of years, Odin shut this down by noting that they were not gods.

Loki being sentenced to eternal imprisonment
Loki's intentions were mocked by Odin, who noted that Loki's only birthright was to die on Jotunheim when he had been abandoned by Laufey, as Odin claimed that if they had not taken him in, he would not be alive to hate them. Odin told him that he will spare his life only because of Frigga's love for him. Odin condemned Loki to an eternal imprisonment, and called him by the name, Loki Laufeyson. Loki was put in the Asgardian Dungeons deep beneath the Palace.

Return of the Dark Elves
Solitude in Prison
Loki locked within the Asgardian Dungeon
Having been condemned to eternal imprisonment, Loki was locked in a cell within the Asgardian Dungeons deep beneath the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf. With centuries to be spent alone by himself, Loki's only source of amusement was to watch as new prisoners arrived in the Dungeons and to read the many books that Frigga would send him. However, the longer he spent in his cell, the more bitter and resentful Loki became towards Odin for his lies and what Loki considered a cruel prison sentence.

Loki watches as the Marauders arrive in prison
A year after the Battle of New York, Loki still remained in his cell. Unknown to him, a war raged across the Nine Realms as a result of the Duel at the Rainbow Bridge having destroyed many of the ways across the Realms. A group of space pirates called the Marauders used this to their advantage and attacked Vanaheim. After their defeat at the hands of Thor, Lady Sif and the Warriors Three, they were locked in cells next to Loki's.

Loki is visited by Frigga's illusion
Despite his solitude, Frigga alone continued to communicate with Loki despite the commands of Odin, and did so via a projection of herself to his cell. She also continued to supply him with books to help pass the time. During one visit, Frigga attempted to make Loki consider his actions during the Chitauri Invasion and accept his crimes, but Loki only argued that she and Odin were not his true family and therefore had no right to judge his actions.

Sacking of Asgard
Loki overhearing the prison riot breaking out
While he sat alone inside of his cell in the Asgardian Dungeons, Loki had amused himself by throwing and catching ornaments to pass the time. As he attempted to relax, however, Loki suddenly overheard the sounds of horrific screams from another part of the Dungeons as the members of the Einherjar were alerted and had gone to investigate. As Loki looked out, he saw a Marauder had magically transformed himself into a monstrous Kurse with a Kurse Stone and broken out of his own cell.

Loki confronts and offers advice to Kurse.
As the monstrous Kurse had revealed himself as a Dark Elf who was looking to destroy Asgard and its leadership, Loki watched with great amusement as Kurse slaughtered the Asgardians who had attempted to stop him while also breaking over Marauders free from their cells. Although Kurse looked at Loki, he did not see Loki as a warrior and did not set him free; however, Loki, grasping another opportunity to harass Odin, advised the Dark Elf where to find the exit.

Loki completely ignores the ongoing battle
Loki remained in his cell as a battle broke out between the guards and the escaped prisoners. Ignoring all the chaos, Loki had calmly continued to read one of his books even when Thor and the Warriors Three joined the battle, violently throwing prisoners into his cell wall. Loki eventually stopped to observe the ongoing battle as the room shook as a Dark Elf Harrow crash-landed into the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf and the entire army of Dark Elves had then attacked the Palace.

Loki is informed that Frigga has been killed
Eventually, the battle subsided and appeared to have been won by the forces of Asgard, as Malekith had failed with his goal to reclaim the greatest weapon of the Dark Elves, the Aether. Not long after all the sounds of battle had died away and peace had seemingly been restored to Asgard, a guard had come to visit Loki and informed him that Frigga had been killed by the Dark Elves, who attacked Asgard at the same time as the prison riot also broken out.

Loki grieves Frigga by destroying his own cell
Loki thanked the guard for informing him of this and then stood in silence, processing the news. Although he had appeared calm, this knowledge that the one person who had ever believed and cared for him was gone had sent Loki into a fit of rage and he unleashed a seismic blast of his mystical aura, trashing his cell. Loki completely destroyed every piece of comfort which Frigga had ever given him, clawed at the walls and cut his feet in his painful grief.

Liberation
Loki being offered up his freedom by Thor
With his cell in ruins and his only comfort gone, Loki briefly used an illusion to hide his disheveled appearance when he is visited by Thor, who saw through Loki's illusion. Thor told Loki that he planned to confront Malekith on Svartalfheim and he needed Loki's knowledge of the pathways between worlds. Promising Loki that they would have their revenge for Frigga's death and his freedom as a reward for his help, Thor also vowed that if Loki betrayed him he would kill him without hesitation; nonetheless, Loki agreed to Thor's proposal.

Loki and Thor prepare to escape from Asgard
Free from his cell and excited by the prospect of an adventure while also impressed by Thor's clandestine tactics, Loki began to make fun with Thor, claiming that he was surprised that Thor did not wish to use his strength to escape instead. Using his magic, Loki gave his brother the appearance of Lady Sif while transforming himself first into an Asgardian Warrior and then into Captain America, noting that Thor seemed to prefer the company of the Avengers.

Loki being tricked and handcuffed by Thor
As Loki continued to talk and mock Captain America's Uniform for its tight fit and amusing connotations, Thor grabbed him and pushed him against a wall, covering his mouth. Seeing two Einherjar guards keeping watch, Loki advised that he be given some form of weapon, such as his knife. Thor seemingly relented but instead of providing him with his blade, Thor simply shackled him. While Loki appeared unimpressed, Thor reminded him that he usually enjoyed tricks.

Loki's life is threatened by Lady Sif
As they were approached the abandoned shuttle of the Dark Elves, both Lady Sif and Volstagg threatened to kill the amused Loki if he even thought about betraying Thor. When they reached Jane Foster, she punched Loki in the face, telling him the punch was for what he did to New York City. Still amused, Loki commented to Thor that he liked Foster for her feisty nature before they continued their journey to the ship.

Loki mocks Thor's attempts at flying the ship
Boarding the crashed Dark Elf Harrow while Volstagg kept the guards at bay, Thor, Foster, and Loki flew it out of the palace. Loki and Thor continued with their brotherly bickering, with Loki commenting on Thor's poor flying skills, especially when he accidentally beheaded a statue of Bor. Loki suggested that the pilot the ship; Thor reminded him that he was the only one who could fly, despite Loki's proven ability to use unfamiliar technology. When Foster fainted due to the Aether in her veins, Loki casually asked if she was dead and berated Thor about his poor plan.

Loki making his escape from Asgard
As he continued he spill out insults to his brother, Loki was then pushed onto a Asgardian Skiff flown by Fandral. Once Thor landed on the Skiff as well, Loki commented on how impressed he was that he had successfully tricked him. As Fandral helped the trio make their way out by attacking the Einherjar, Loki was able to fly the Skiff to a secret location where he was able to transport them out of Asgard and onto the Dark Elves' homeworld of Svartalfheim.

A Tense Truce
Loki argues with Thor about their past
When the three arrived in Svartalfheim, Loki continued to drive the Asgardian Skiff while Thor cared for Jane Foster as she recovered from the Aether's power overloading her body. Loki began to mock Thor's love for a human woman and antagonized his brother, claiming that within a heartbeat she would be dead and he would live on due to the Asgardian lifespan being so much longer.

Loki tells Thor he should trust his rage
As Loki claimed that the Dark Elves' attack was Thor's doing for locking him in the Asgardian Dungeons, he managed to annoy his brother so much that Thor pushed him back and considered punching him in the face; however, Thor stopped himself as he believed Frigga would not want them to fight. Loki argued that while he was right, she would not be surprised. When Thor told Loki he wished he could trust him, Loki told him to trust his rage.

Battle of Svartalfheim
Loki and Thor watch Malekith's arrival
Arriving in Svartalfheim, Loki and Thor looked over the wasteland of the planet as they saw Malekith and his small army of Dark Elves exiting their Ark to confront their attacks. While Loki commented that their plan would undoubtedly get them all killed, Thor uncuffed his brother and prepared to attack their enemies, with Loki questioning if Thor trusted him or not.

Loki seemingly makes a deal with Malekith
When Thor asked if Loki would even trust himself, Loki told him that he would not. As part of their plan, Loki then pretended to betray Thor, stabbing him in the side and kicking him off the edge of the cliff. While the Dark Elves watched, Loki mocked and insulted his brother before making an illusion of him cutting off Thor's right hand. Loki then threw Jane Foster before the Dark Elves, claiming his allegiance with them and his desire to watch Asgard burn.

Loki saves Jane Foster from the Aether
As Malekith started absorbing the Aether from Foster's body, Thor and Loki revealed their ruse. Loki quickly removed the illusion he had cast and jumped on top of Foster in order to shield her while Thor used Mjølnir to shoot lightning at the Aether, dispersing it in an explosion. However, Malekith was still able to absorb the fragments. As the Dark Elves retreated to their giant ship, Malekith's lieutenant Kurse stayed behind to keep Thor and Loki busy.

Loki is almost sucked into a black hole
With Malekith having regained the Aether from the Asgardians as he had planned, he no longer had any need to keep them alive and ordered their demise. When Kurse threw his Black Hole Grenades into the air towards them, Loki pushed Jane Foster away from it without hesitation. Though he himself was nearly sucked in it, he was saved at the last moment by Thor as they prepared to retaliate against the Dark Elves and stop Malekith.

Loki is challenged by a team of Dark Elves
While Thor fought the almighty Kurse as Malekith made his escape on his Ark, Loki was attacked by another group of Dark Elves. Armed only with his dagger, Loki found himself surrounded but remained confident in his abilities and instantly began planning how to beat them. As the Elves attacked, Loki easily defeated them all by using his speed and trickery to gain the upper hand and kill them before seeing that Thor was struggling to battle Kurse.

Faking Death
Loki bravely attacks and impales Kurse
Seeing Thor being beaten into submission by Kurse, Loki ran to his brother's aid. He stabbed Kurse from behind, pushing the blade through his chest. The Kursed warrior then grabbed Loki and pulled him onto the blade, stabbing him as well. As one final ruse before he began losing strength, Loki activated one of Kurse's Black Hole Grenades, which then sucked the Dark Elf into a black hole, crushing his entire body and destroying him in just mere seconds. Thus, Frigga's death was avenged.

Loki seemingly dies from his wounds
With Kurse destroyed and Loki seemingly mortally wounded from his injury, Thor ran to his aid and told a dying Loki that he would tell Odin about his noble deed. Loki looked into his brother's eyes and replied that he did not do it for Odin, but for Frigga, before his skin turned grey and he seemingly died in Thor's arms as his brother cried out in grief. As it appeared Loki was dead, Thor and Jane Foster left him behind on Svartalfheim as they continued their mission to stop Malekith.

Loki disguised as an Einherjar Guard
However, Loki's death was just another of his illusions. Seemly weak but still alive, Loki then waited for Thor and Foster to depart from the planet to find Malekith on Earth. Then, when an Einherjar Guard had come to check the battlefield, Loki apparently killed the guard and took his place, returning to Asgard without anyone seeing. Disguised as the Einherjar Guard, Loki informed Odin that a body was found on the battlefield. Odin responded, believing Loki to be dead.

King of Asgard
Stealing the Throne
Loki successfully disguises himself as Odin
Loki managed to take Odin's place and usurped the throne of Asgard. When Thor defeated Malekith, he returned to Asgard to give his report to Odin. Disguised as Odin, Loki offered him the throne, but Thor declined while honoring Loki's sacrifice. Thor then offered him Mjølnir, but Loki told him it belongs to him if he is worthy of it, knowing full well that he could not take it from him. Thor thanked him and left the room.

Loki proudly reclaims the Throne of Asgard
Loki reverted to his true form and smiled in triumph at reclaiming the throne of Asgard at long last. Some time into Loki's reign, Lorelei had escaped to Earth using one of the secret passageways between worlds. Loki, still disguised as Odin, ordered Lady Sif to go capture Lorelei and bring her back to Asgard. During his observation of Earth, Heimdall saw the Kree land on the planet. Due to the enmity between Kree and Asgardians, Loki sent Sif to investigate.

Loki has a statue built to honor himself
Afraid he would be exposed, Loki banished Lady Sif from Asgard. In order to prevent Thor from picking up on any subtle differences in their personalities and eventually figuring out Odin was really Loki in disguise, Loki granted Thor the freedom to act as he pleased in order to keep the peace of the Nine Realms, which would mean that Thor would be away from Asgard more often while Loki could rule Asgard in peace and enjoy all of the riches this power brought him.

Loki's "demise" is depicted in a theatrical play
Loki also banished Heimdall from his long-standing position as the guard of the Bifrost Bridge and appointed Skurge as his replacement. Skurge's true purpose was to report to Loki when Thor had returned to Asgard, allowing Loki time to switch to Odin's stricter personality. While taking pleasure in his role, Loki convinced the Asgardians that he was a tragic figure, commissioning a large statue of himself while also commissioning a Stage Production of his own death a script for which he wrote himself.

Search for Odin
Loki watches the play honoring his death
Having been ruling over Asgard for four years while enjoying himself immensely, Loki, still in his Odin disguise, took time out of his day to sit with the Asgardians, eating grapes and watching the play, The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard, which depicted his "death" on Svartalfheim. As the performers acted out the production, Loki smiled and commented on the piece, quoting the lines with them and then clapping enthusiastically once they were finished with the play.

Loki is shocked by Thor's return to Asgard
However, to Loki's surprise, Thor unexpectedly arrived and greeted him, having also brought with him the Crown of Surtur following his recent Escape from Muspelheim, with a suspicious Thor questioning if Loki even knew what it was before sending it into Odin's Vault. Loki questioned if Thor would be heading back onto Midgard soon in the hope that his cover would not be blown: However, Thor confirmed he was not, which had made Loki considerably more nervous.

Loki is forced by Thor to finally reveal himself
Thor then explained that he had been having some recurring dreams recently depicting Ragnarök, so he had begun investigating this and found the Nine Realms in utter chaos and Marauders who had been marching unchallenged as the King did nothing. Loki tried to defend his actions, but Thor was not buying his excuses and proceeded to threaten Loki by putting him into the path of Mjølnir, with Loki finally breaking his disguise in front of all of the horrified Asgardians.

Loki attempts to defend his recent actions
The moment Loki's true identity was revealed, Skurge finally arrived, having run from Himinbjorg, to announce Thor's arrival, much to Loki's great annoyance as he reminded Skurge that warning him of Thor's arrival was his only job. Exposed, Loki tried to defend his deception, insisting that Asgard had prospering while Thor had the independence he always wanted, claiming that by revealing his identity Thor had ruined everything he had just achieved.

Loki is pinned down and questioned by Thor
Ignoring all that Loki was saying, Thor then furiously demanded to know where Odin was, questioning if Loki had murdered him or not. When Loki refused to answer him, Thor responded by pinning Loki with Mjølnir for the first time in years, at which Loki easily gave up their father's location at Shady Acres Care Home where Loki had left him. Thor had then put Volstagg and Fandral in temporary charge of the Bifrost Bridge as he and Loki went to investigate further.

Encountering Doctor Strange
Loki and Thor searching for Odin together
When they reached Earth, they discovered that the retirement home within New York City where Loki had left Odin had been bulldozed, which left Loki with no idea where Odin was now. When Loki insisted that he could not have predicted this had happened, Thor teased him by questioning why he now dressed as a witch. Thor then questioned how Loki was still alive following witnessing his death at the hands of Kurse back on Svartalfheim, insisting that he had mourned for his loss which Loki claimed he was honored to hear.

Loki falling through Doctor Strange's portal
While Thor then posed for a photograph with two Humans, Loki then overheard that Thor had been dumped by Jane Foster only to be distracted by something happening underneath him. Looking down, Loki saw a small portal was being created underneath him which he insisted he had nothing to do with. Before he could react, Loki then fell through the portal that had just opened beneath his feet, conjured by Doctor Strange to keep Loki from harming anyone on Earth.

Loki is freed from falling through the portal
While Loki was falling through an unknown space, Thor then visited Doctor Strange who offered to locate Odin on the condition that Loki, Odin, and Thor promptly returned back to Asgard thereafter to avoid anything like the Battle of New York happening again. After thirty minutes of falling, Strange remembered about Loki and then used his own Sling Ring to warp him inside the New York Sanctum, where the furious Loki confronted Strange for letting him fall for so long.

Loki gets teleported away by Doctor Strange
Upon hearing Strange note that he thought Thor could now handle his brother from his point on as they said their goodbyes, Loki, out of annoyance and anger, attempted to attack Doctor Strange, furiously calling the Master of Mystic Arts a second-rate magician as he then drew a pair of knives to get his revenge. Doctor Strange, however, had refused to even bother engaging with Loki and simply sent him and Thor through the portal to Norway, where Odin was waiting.

Father's Farewell
Loki and Thor both find Odin standing alone
Along with Thor, the two brothers fell through Doctor Strange's portal where they found and joined Odin, who was standing alone on the edge of a cliff within Norway, watching over the entire landscape. As they approached him, Odin appeared distracted, commenting on how he could hear Frigga calling out to him, which Thor mistook as more of Loki's Magic still having an effect on their father, although Loki denied this.

Loki and Thor are reunited back with Odin
Odin revealed that he had broken from Loki's spell but told Loki that his mother would be proud of him for casting an effective spell onto him, which had shocked Loki who had not ever had such praise from Odin. Sitting down while still overlooking the landscape, Odin told his sons to admire all the beauty of the landscape and the sea in front of him, reminiscing of Asgard. While Odin explained that Ragnarök was upon them, Thor told his father he had put an end to Ragnarök.

Thor and Loki witness the passing of Odin
Odin, however, had explained that Ragnarök would not be started by Surtur but the arrival of Hela, noting that his own life was the only thing holding Hela back. Odin explained that Hela was, in fact, Thor's first-born sister who had been imprisoned within Hel for thousands of years due to her violent needs. While Odin considered this shocking news, Odin told Loki and Thor that he loved them both as his body dissipated into energy and was taken away by the wind.

Loki attempting to calm down Thor's rage
Having witnessed the death of his father and having learned Odin's secrets regarding Hela, Thor's grief and anger caused storm clouds to gather above, as he furiously claimed that this was Loki's fault, as it had been Loki's actions with banishing Odin to Earth without any of his Asgardian powers which had led to Odin's body dying of his long life. While lightning came out of Thor's fingertips as his anger grew, Loki fearfully had then attempted to calm him back down.

Hela's Return
Thrown from the Bifrost
Loki and Thor meeting Hela for the first time
With Odin now dead and past into the afterlife, Loki and Thor were then forced to put aside their differences as Hela, having now been released from her prison in Hel due to Odin's death, materialized before them. Loki and Thor then returned to their Asgardian uniforms to then greet Hela once she returned, who commented on how she wished she had been there to witness her own father's demise.

Loki attempting to create a peace with Hela
Loki looked on as Thor introduced himself as the son of Odin, while Hela commented that he did not look like Odin. Loki then attempted to make an arrangement with Hela, to which she had commented that Loki sounded more like Odin than Thor did. Hela then ordered the two brothers to kneel before her as she drew her Necroswords, while Loki attempted to talk things peacefully. Loki then watched as Hela destroyed Mjølnir, proving Hela to be incredibly powerful.

Loki being chased through the Bifrost Bridge
Seeing that they were vastly outmatched by their newest enemy, Loki quickly tried to go back into Asgard with Thor through their Bifrost Bridge. However, Thor horrifically told Loki not to use Bifrost Bridge, as it will cause Hela to follow them while going back to Asgard, but was too late, while Hela still followed closely behind and eventually launched both Thor and Loki out of the Bifrost during mid-transport, with Loki now believing that this had caused Thor's demise.

Living on Sakaar
Loki happily relaxes while trapped on Sakaar
Upon being launched out of the Bifrost Bridge by Hela, Loki had then arrived on Sakaar. Despite being in such a strange environment, Loki had soon managed to come in the favor of the Grandmaster who had viewed Loki as his friend and had often invited Loki to rejoin him to enjoy the Contest of Champions which the Grandmaster had enjoyed putting on. Loki then enjoyed a prolonged period of several weeks drinking with the Sakaarans and telling stories of the Duel at the Rainbow Bridge, enjoying all of the reactions he got from telling these such stories of his own life before he had arrived within Sakaar.

Loki discovers that Thor is actually still alive
While telling some of his stories to the amused Sakaarans, Loki was then completely and utterly shocked to discover that Thor was still alive following their encounter with Hela some weeks earlier, although he had been captured by the Grandmaster and was being prepped to face his champion. Loki and Thor had reunited as Thor questioned what was happening while Loki noted that he had not had the same experience as Thor had gone through when he had arrived.

Loki and Grandmaster watch Thor's capture
While they were awkwardly being watched by the Grandmaster, Loki had then explained that he could not do anything more to ensure his brother's release from the Grandmaster's custody. The Grandmaster asked if Loki knew Thor, which the former denied knowing before Thor added that they were brothers. However, Loki clarified that he was adopted. The Grandmaster then noted that the only way that Thor would be able to finally win his own freedom would be to defeat his Champion, before sending him away to meet the Gladiators who included Korg and Miek, while Loki still remained by the Grandmaster and had enjoyed all the many joys which were presented to him.

Suggestion to Thor

Seeking to make his own way off from Sakaar, Loki had then quietly communicated to Thor via a holographic projection in his cell for the Contest of Champions, where he attempted to convince Thor to abandon Asgard, and instead, join him by the Grandmaster's side so they could both live in luxury. However, Thor refused to talk to his adopted brother, merely throwing stones through his projection.

Loki proposes how to deal with Grandmaster
Loki suggested to Thor that they betray the Grandmaster and allow him to die so they could control Sakaar together. However, as Thor continued to throw stones at him in frustration, Loki had seemingly begun to show genuine worry of what would happen if Thor goes up against Hela again, noting how during their first encounter Hela had destroyed Mjølnir like it was nothing more than a piece of glass and was therefore clearly more powerful than either the pair of them.

Loki's illusion is forced to leave Thor's cell
Loki prepared to leave, Thor blamed him for everything happening to him, scolding him for causing Odin's death and, in turn, his part with releasing Hela from Hel and then causing the deaths of the Warriors Three. Remaining calm and focused on himself, Loki warned Thor that the Grandmaster's champion is "astonishingly savage" and had noted that he had made his large wager against Thor, before Loki's illusion left as Korg appeared to tell Loki's illusion to leave.

Reunion with Hulk
Loki waits to watch the Contest of Champions
Still enjoying his time in Sakaar, Loki came to watch Thor as he had prepared to fight in the Contest of Champions. Taking a drink as he entered, Loki watched while Thor put on his helmet and prepared for the battle, armed with Doug's Mace and Shield and a pair of swords, with Loki still remaining confident that he would make a grand profit out of watching Thor lose in the upcoming battle.

Loki is ordered to stay by the Grandmaster
As Loki watched from above, he happily awaited the arrival of the Champion who Thor would be fighting against. However, it had turned out that the champion was Hulk, to Loki's shock and horror as he recalled how Hulk had beaten him senseless during the Battle of New York. Unwilling to be near Hulk again, Loki had attempted to leave Sakaar only for the Grandmaster to stop him as he insisted that Loki stay and watch the fight with him.

Loki awkwardly watches as Thor talks to Hulk
Not revealing to the Grandmaster that he had previously encountered Hulk, Loki sat in awkward silence while Thor delighted at being reunited with his fellow Avenger, as Thor pointed to Loki who was sat watching in horror. Thor then attempted to catch up with his friend, explaining how Hela had returned and destroyed Mjølnir, however, Hulk became annoyed as Thor had still continued referring to him as Bruce Banner, resulting in Hulk furiously attacking Thor.

Loki watches while Thor battles Hulk
Loki watched as Thor and Hulk furiously battled each other, while Hulk had soon managed to gain the upper hand, armed with his own Sakaaran Battle Axe and War Hammer. However, when Thor had managed to land a heavy blow against Hulk, he attempted to use the Black Widow's technique to calm him down, only for Hulk to smash Thor into the ground as he had done to Loki back in New York, much to Loki's delight as he yelled that Thor now knew how he felt.

Loki watches as Hulk finally defeats Thor
Loki and the Grandmaster kept watching as Thor and Hulk continued fighting, until Thor unexpectedly gained a sudden surge of his power, allowing his entire body to be engulfed with lightning as he struck Hulk and damaged his Sakaaran Battle Armor. Unwilling to watch his beloved Champion defeated, however, Grandmaster activated Thor's own Obedience Disk, which then caused him to fall down to the floor, allowing Hulk to finally win the duel, much to Loki's dismay.

Challenging Valkyrie
Loki and Valkyrie meet with the Grandmaster
While Loki continued enjoying the luxury of his lifestyle while he was still staying in Sakaar, meanwhile Thor and Hulk had disappeared from their cells, resulting in the Grandmaster becoming furious about their escape and demanded that they be found. Loki and the Grandmaster's chief bounty hunter Scrapper 142 were contacted by the Grandmaster, who offered a great bounty for their capture as he refused to allow his beloved champion to escape from Sakaar.

Loki promises to find both Thor and Hulk
In his attempt to maintain the favor of the Grandmaster, Loki vowed to bring both Thor and Hulk back to him within hours, although Scrapper 142 made the same promise. When Loki interrupted the Grandmaster, Topaz had responded by offering him the Melt Stick to punish Loki by destroying him, although Grandmaster insisted that interruption was not a crime punishable by death. The Grandmaster then sent Loki and Scrapper 142 to complete their task for him.

Loki has a brief duel against the Valkyrie
As they made their way out of the meeting with Grandmaster, Loki and Scrapper 142 had a brief argument instead of beginning their search for Thor and Hulk, as this had quickly turned into a duel, with both drawing their knives and slashing at the other. During their fight, however, Loki then noticed a tattoo on Scrapper 142's arm and realized she was, in fact, the last living Valkyrie; however, Valkyrie was clearly unwilling to allow this secret to be revealed as she kicked Loki away and furiously threatened him by pinning him against the wall and telling him to chose his next words carefully, although Loki had still remained unintimidated by Valkyrie's threat against his life.

Loki giving Valkyrie her horrifying flashback
Noting what a painful memory it must be for her, Loki used his Magic to then make Valkyrie relive the Massacre of the Valkyrie at the hands of Hela when she had attempted to escape from Hel, which had also eventually had led to Valkyrie living her life on Sakaar and drinking herself towards death. Furious at Loki's actions at making her relive her own trauma, Valkyrie responded by knocking him out with a hard punch to the face before chaining him up inside her room.

Betraying the Grandmaster
Loki is chained up and brought back to Thor
Having been captured by Valkyrie, Loki was left chained up inside of her room, waiting for her to return. He was later presented as a peace offer to Thor and Bruce Banner, who had returned to Human Form. Thor first ensured this really was Loki by throwing a bottle at his head, before Banner noted how they had last seen each other during the Battle of New York, as Loki calmly threatened Banner.

Loki happily agrees to betray the Grandmaster
While he remained chained up, Loki had listened as Thor, Banner and Valkyrie discussed how to leave Sakaar and return back to Asgard by going through the Devil's Anus. As the team were discussing how they would require a strong ship to get through the Anus, Loki spoke up and noted that the Grandmaster had several ships which could do the job, and then offered to give their team access to these ships in exchange for safe passage away from Sakaar for himself.

Loki listens as the Revengers make their plan
Although Loki offered his help, Banner was nervous about trusting him, noting how Loki had just threatened his life. Loki then listened and smiled to himself as Thor told the others a story of how Loki had tricked Thor by using magic to turn into a snake before stabbing his brother. They finally agreed to Loki's plan, noting they would need a distraction as Loki suggested unleashing Hulk, but Thor dismissed this as they agreed to start a Rebellion as a distraction.

Sakaaran Rebellion

While Valkyrie had successfully initiated the revolution on Sakaar by giving Korg and the other Contest of Champions gladiators weapons, Loki and Thor had teamed up to steal one of the Grandmaster's shield generator-powered ships. Now armed with the Sakaaran Laser Rifles, Loki and Thor had together charged straight through all the Sakaaran Guards who had been ordered to stand in their way.

Loki fights against the Grandmaster's guards
While taking cover, Loki noted that Odin had brought them together when he had taken Loki from Jotunheim, claiming that it was almost poetic that his death them break them apart for good. Thor continued firing while Loki unlocked the doorways, while still claiming that they might as well become strangers, before being threatened by another Sakaaran Guard who Thor dispatched by forcing him to fire into the ground which shot him into the air as they entered the elevator.

Loki and Thor discussing their futures apart
Once they got inside of the elevator, Loki suggested that he should actually stay in Sakaar, which Thor immediately agreed with as he claimed it fit his lawless and chaotic personality perfectly, much to Loki's surprise. Thor went on to admit that he had always thought the world of his own brother and had hoped they would fight side by side forever, but had come to the conclusion that this would never happen the way they wanted, which clearly had conflicted Loki internally.

Loki and Thor use their "Get Help" strategy
Knowing that they would soon encounter more of the Grandmaster's guards, Thor suggested that they utilize their "Get Help" strategy, much to Loki's horror. Although he tried to object, Thor still managed to convince Loki as they ran out with Thor pretending Loki needed some medical assistance before throwing his brother at the Sakaaran Guards, knocking him out. Thor delighted in the successful strategy while Loki continued moaning about how humiliating it was.

Loki attempting to deceive and betray Thor
While they went to steal the Commodore from the Grandmaster, Loki, inevitably, betrayed them as they are escaping, using his magic to create an illusion of himself which kept speaking with Thor while his actual self had then attempted to alert the Grandmaster of what was happening. Upon revealing his betrayal, Loki assured Thor that while he had betrayed him many times before, this was truly not personal as the Grandmaster's reward would then set him up financially.

Loki is tricked and then left behind by Thor
However, it turned out that Thor had predicted his brother's betrayal and had quietly placed the Obedience Disk on his back which he had then activated, which had left Loki being shocked on the floor and completely unable to move. Thor told his brother that he knew Loki will always be the God of Mischief, but had hoped that he would have shown some capacity for growth before leaving, with Loki still being shocked and the remote put just out of Loki's reach.
