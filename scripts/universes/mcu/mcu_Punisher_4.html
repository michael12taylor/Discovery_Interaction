Castle had still continued to ignore Bendix as she had commented on Madani's apartment, before she had questioned why Castle had access to the Homeland Security Helicopter that could fly them out of Ohio, before she then made it clear that she knew his actual name was Frank.

Castle sees Billy Russo's escape on the news
Instead of answering her questions, Castle simply told Bendix to take Madani's bedroom, while he would be sleeping on the couch.

Castle is asked for any updates on Billy Russo
However, Castle then scoffed over this comment, noting that he had called her to get her help when he was at the Larkville County Sheriff Station and was completely ignored by her, but now she had brought him back to New York City because she needed him to deal with Billy Russo, noting that this was likely because she was not allowed to go after Russo. Castle listened as Madani had noted that it was thought that Russo would eventually die during his six week long coma, while he was being treated at Sacred Saints Hospital, only for him to prove everybody wrong by surviving, as he eventually woke back up.

Castle looking through Billy Russo's Journal
Castle had continued to listen as Madani explained the surgeries that Russo had undergone following their showdown, noting all his brain trauma and his facial reconstruction, and somehow Russo had defied the doctor's expectations by not only surviving, but actually learning how to function again, despite these injuries. Madani then presented Castle with Russo's Journal, which was filled with all his sketches of Skull Imagery, making it clear that Russo was haunted by images of the Punisher, as Madani had suggested that Russo had actually been pretending to not remember what happened to between them.

Castle getting given back his former Skull Vest
With Madani still insisting that Russo had pretended to have lost his mind, while he actually remembered everything, noting that he was only thinking about the Punisher, Castle then claimed that this what he wanted. Since Castle was not taking it all seriously, Madani then presented him with his Skull Vest, noting that the blood that was on it belonged to him, her and Russo, noting that while Castle got closure, Russo did not, with Madani also insisting that the only closure Russo understood would be a bullet in the head. However, Castle had then noted that Madani also had her chance to kill Russo and failed to.

Castle questions Dinah Madani's motivations
Madani then told Castle that she had gone over to see Russo inside the hospital every day, waiting for him to admit what he had done to them. When Madani had noted that they had both trusted Russo, she claimed it this could be the real reason why Castle had also failed to kill him, although Castle insisted that killing Russo would have been too easy for him, which Madani doubted was the reason. Castle then questioned if he was there to kill Russo for her, although Madani had instead asked for the names of anything that might help her to locate Russo, although Castle noted that this conflict would never end.

Reunion with Curtis Hoyle

Intended to do his own research into the current situation, Castle had prepared to leave Dinah Madani's Apartment, without anybody there ever noticing he was gone, as he checked to see if Amy Bendix was still asleep, before locking her bedroom door to ensure that she did not run away.

Castle and Curtis Hoyle discussing Billy Russo
When Hoyle placed his gun down onto the table, Castle asked about why he had it, to which Hoyle noted that if Billy Russo ever began to remember everything, he feared that he could become his first target. Castle had questioned if Hoyle really believed that Russo had lost his memories, with Hoyle noting that Castle had cracked his skull during their showdown, so it was hardly surprising. Castle listened as Hoyle explained that he was listed as Russo's next of kin, and he had gone to Sacred Saints Hospital to see Russo in person, as he commented about how bad Russo's mental and physical condition had been.

Castle asking if Billy Russo remembers him
Castle noted how Madani thought that Russo had been putting on an act, which Hoyle disagreed with, noting how Russo had believed that they were still with their United States Armed Forces and that he had spoken about Castle like his brother. Hoyle had then told Castle that, all those memories he wanted Russo to live with, he had knocked out of his head, with Hoyle claiming that as the result, everybody except Russo had to live with those memories. Hoyle had told Castle that he should have simply killed Russo, which Castle agreed with, as Hoyle commented on how they were trying to run from those feelings.

Castle offering Curtis Hoyle to help him again
Hoyle complained to Castle that he wanted to live his own life, which did not include having to carry a gun in his apartment, which Castle understood. Changing the subject, Hoyle then told Castle about how he was dating Delia Robinson, which pleased Castle, although Hoyle insisted that he did not want Robinson to get anywhere near the war with Russo.

Amy Bendix's Confessions
Castle witnesses Amy Bendix's angry outburst
Once Castle had returned back inside Dinah Madani's Apartment, he then found Amy Bendix in a panic, as she had desperately attempted to escape from the bedroom that he had locked her inside.

Castle and Amy Bendix sitting down to talk
Once she had calmed down, Castle sat with Bendix as she described how she woke up every morning and could smell the hot sauce from the tacos she had brought to Fiona's crew before finding them dead, noting that blood also had a certain smell to it. Castle offered Bendix his coffee to calm herself down, although Bendix had noted that this was not how caffeine worked. Although Bendix tried to change their subject by suggesting that Castle should go to the hospital to get his hand looked at, Castle instead suggested that she should try and talk to him about what she was feeling and what she had witnessed.

Castle listening to Amy Bendix about her crew
Bendix told Castle about how she had gone to get tacos for Fiona's crew but had found them all dead, so she had hidden under the bed and then witnessed John Pilgrim returning. When Castle asked who Pilgrim was, Bendix began to panic and suggested that they should leave New York City before Pilgrim found them, noting that this was what Fiona would have done, as she explained to Castle who Fiona was. As Castle suggested that if Fiona was doing the kinds of jobs that got people killed, then Fiona would not have really cared about them, Bendix defended Fiona, noting that Castle did not know her.

Castle listening to Amy Bendix on how she felt
Dismissing Castle's questions about how she had started working for Fiona, Bendix then continued discussing how she had watched her friends bleeding out in their motel room and she had been unable to run away as Pilgrim had come back into the room. When Castle then asked what had caused this, Bendix explained that Fiona had given them the job in Chicago to work as the catering for a funeral and take pictures of the guests, as they took a picture of David Schultz kissing his male partner in private, while noting that she had felt weird about doing it but dismissed these thoughts as they no longer mattered.

Castle suggests Amy Bendix to fight back
Looking at Castle's reaction, Bendix accused him of not understand what she had gone through, noting how Pilgrim had killed everybody she had ever cared about as she asked if Castle knew how this had felt, which he did not answer. When Bendix had suggested that they leave before Pilgrim could kill them, and use Shantel as a resource to get out of the city, Castle claimed that this would be impossible since Pilgrim would never stop until he found her and killed her, noting that Pilgrim clearly had connections. As Bendix had then asked what they could do, Castle told her it was time to bring the fight to Pilgrim.

Search for Billy Russo

While Castle and Amy Bendix were eating cereal together, they were then interrupted by the return of Dinah Madani, who then expressed her surprise that they had stayed inside her apartment, as Castle had joked that all of her health food had almost driven them off. Castle and Madani had then begun discussing where they would locate Billy Russo, with Castle noting that if Russo had actually been lying about all of those mental and physical injuries, then it would be more likely that he would already be dead, as Madani had then asked him to explain exactly what he meant by this.

Castle tells Dinah Madani about Arthur Walsh
Getting up, Castle told Madani about Arthur Walsh, explaining that he was the man who sexually abused Russo when he was a child at Ray of Hope, with Madani making it clear that she already knew the story. Castle then went on to explain that there was a time that Russo had wanted to make Walsh pay for what he did previously to him, as they had both gone to find Walsh, only for Russo to then change his mind about assaulting Walsh. While Madani had questioned if he believed that Russo would target Walsh again, with Castle making it clear that he was unsure, but thought Russo could be angry enough to do it.

Castle offering Dinah Madani to help her out
While Madani took down these notes about Walsh, Castle suggested that he could take down Walsh for her, in order to keep Madani away from it, although Madani suggested that Castle might not be strong enough with a broken wrist. However, Castle had noted that Madani was previously shot for him, insisting that he owed her, while Bendix then tried to question who they really were, while Castle and Madani told her to shut up. Although Madani insisted that she would simply arrest Russo through legal means, Castle recommended that she not hesitate before shooting Russo dead, as Russo would not hesitate.

Castle and Amy Bendix hiding in the bedroom
However, they were then interrupted by a knock at the door, as both Castle and Bendix hid inside the bedroom while Madani opened the door to Brett Mahoney, who had come over to ask Madani if she had stolen Russo's Journal from Sacred Saints Hospital, which she had denied. Castle and Bendix listened, while Madani spoke to Mahoney about the investigation into Russo, until Madani had left and pushed Mahoney out. Castle and Bendix then stepped out, as Castle said he would have shower, sarcastically asking if that was alright, as Bendix commented that she would not watch, which Castle scoffed at.

Agreement with Amy Bendix
Castle realizes Amy Bendix is outside the door
Castle had later realized that Amy Bendix had also managed to leave the Apartment, until he heard a knock at their door, with Bendix then announcing her presence.

Castle talks to Amy Bendix about his family
Castle then confirmed that he had already slaughtered everyone who was involved with this, while Bendix questioned if doing this had ever actually made him feel better about losing them all, only for Castle to answer that it only did sometimes, with Bendix then questioning what exactly Castle had meant by that comment. However, Castle did not go into any further detail about his actual feelings about avenging the murder of his wife and two children, since he had known that Bendix intended to get revenge for the murders of Fiona and her Crew, since Castle remained unsure if this would be the correct action for her.

Castle learns of Amy Bendix's real name
Castle had then instead noted how Bendix had come back into there when she did not have to, which she confirmed, as the pair stood in silence for a moment. Changing the subject, Bendix told Castle that her name was not actually Rachel, telling him that her real name was Amy, noting that she believed that Castle should know this. Feeling a stronger sense of trust between them, since they now both knew of each other's actual names, Bendix and Castle had then agreed that they would not keep running away from John Pilgrim any longer, and would now take action themselves working as a team together.

Amy Bendix's Card Tricks
Castle playing card games with Amy Bendix
As they waited in the Apartment, Castle and Amy Bendix played card games, in which Bendix showed Castle the game of keeping track on her hidden Queen, which she would carefully shuffle, as Castle would become annoyed that she was beating him at the game. While Bendix shuffled the cards, she asked Castle if he was an assassin for Homeland Security, which Castle denied, while also noting that the name Punisher was not one he chose for himself, before he failed at Bendix's game again, much to Castle's considerable frustration.

Castle loses another round at the card games
Castle was then asked by Bendix about what their plans were, since they had agreed to stop running, with Castle dismissing the question and telling her to focus on the cards. However, when Castle lost the game again, he accused Bendix of cheating, while she insisted that he was simply not seeing the trick. Castle and Bendix then discussed how the game was known to be the scam, but people always played for different reasons, as she noted that Castle's reason was confident that he could beat anyone. Bendix noted that Castle was also bored, drank too much coffee and the frustration of losing kept him there.

Castle listening to all Amy Bendix's comments
When Bendix had once again asked what Castle planned to do about their situation, Castle had asked her what the situation was and how they got there. As she reshuffled the deck of cards, Bendix had noted that everything came back to Sergei Konchevsky, as she phoned him back at Lola's Roadhouse, which had resulted in Marlena Olin's crew attacking them, while she had theorized that Konchevsky ordered the hit to avoid paying. As Castle lost another game, he accused Bendix of holding the Queens in her hand, or swapping the cards, which she denied, as Castle turned over the cards and realized he was wrong.

Castle learning of Amy Bendix's descriptions
Once Bendix had explained to him how the card trick worked, Castle became annoyed as he instead asked Bendix about Konchevsky, as he questioned how they could find him, while Bendix then explained that he was worked with the Russian Mafia in New York City, much to Castle's surprise, since he had expected it to be considerably more difficult to track Konchevsky down. While Castle questioned why she had not mentioned this before, Bendix expressed her annoyance at being brought into New York, although Castle claimed that this made things easier for them, promising that he would find Konchevsky.

Castle getting an idea to contact Turk Barrett
Castle and Bendix then sat back down to play their card game once again, which Castle still lost despite Bendix explaining how the game worked. Bendix had told Castle that he could not win, explaining that knowing how the game worked would not help, since she would then simply change how this was played if she knew that he knew, noting that the only way for him to win would be for him to never play in the first place. However, while Bendix went to Dinah Madani's bedroom, Castle noted that walking from the situation was not an option, while commenting that he only had to ensure that he was the dealer.

Recruiting Turk Barrett

In order to track down Sergei Konchevsky, Castle had sought out the assistance of Turk Barrett. Castle had then managed to break inside Barrett's car and then waited for him to lock up his Shop, as Barrett stepped inside of his car and noticed Castle there, much to Barrett's frustrations. Barrett immediately insisted to Castle that he did not hurt anyone, promising that he had gone legit, to which Castle had explained that he was there to find a member of the Russian Mafia, and believed that Barrett could help him.

Castle demanding to meet Sergei Konchevsky
Castle had then noted that he knew Barrett had previously sold guns to the Russians, which Barrett tried to dismiss, although Castle then explained that he needed to meet up with Konchevsky, while Barrett confirmed that he actually knew Konchevsky. However, Barrett then threatened to call the New York City Police Department and National Guard to come after Castle, to which Castle threatened to kill Barrett before he could even hang up the call. Knowing that he was serious, Barrett explained that Konchevsky worked from Kazan's Gym, noting they were not good people, but the Gym would be a good target.

Castle listens to information from Turk Barrett
Barrett explained that the Russians did not carry guns in the gym due to the police presence, which would allow Castle to kill them. Castle had ordered Barrett to go to these Russians and tell Konchevsky that he had something he needed from Chicago, although Barrett initially refused to go anywhere near the Russians. However, Castle had then promised that he would pay Barrett if he told Konchevsky that he had the photos and the girl, which Barrett agreed to after they negotiated his percentage, with Castle managing to convince Barrett that he had turned to a life of crime, giving a phone number to call him on.

Arguing with Dinah Madani
Castle has a cup of coffee with Dinah Madani
Having returning back into their Apartment, Castle had greeted Dinah Madani, once she returned by the morning, with Castle just claiming that he had stayed up late the previous night with Amy Bendix. While they were then rejoined by Bendix, Castle questioned why Madani had seemed tense, to which she explained that Billy Russo had murdered Arthur Walsh, although Castle expressed his gratitude about Walsh's death. However, Madani claimed that this murder proved that Russo was actually a broken and pathetic man as a result of everything that Russo had already endured.

Castle listening to Amy Bendix's proposition
When Castle questioned what difference Russo's mental state made, Madani claimed that it made none but she needed to find some way of putting Russo behind bars, as Castle then questioned if this would actually fix all their problems. However, they were then interrupted by Bendix, who noted that as the situation with Russo was unlikely to be resolved quickly, she had wondered if Madani could use her contacts at Homeland Security to help them with the Russian Mafia, while she had then suggested that Madani could have them deported, much to Castle's frustration, as he did not intend to tell Madani about this.

Castle tells Dinah Madani to get some sleep
Madani expressed her frustration that Castle had brought yet another war into New York City, questioning if he was actually intending to do anything about Russo. In response, Castle did not say a word, since he did not deny that he was involved with another conflict which had become his priority, until Madani then demanded he speak, to which he just advised Madani to get some sleep. Angered over this, Madani told Castle that he had twenty four hours to leave the city, before she stormed out. When Bendix noted that Madani had issues, Castle had simply commented that Bendix also had a big mouth on her.

Spying on Turk Barrett
Castle spies on Turk Barrett in Kazan's Gym
Castle took up his position outside of Kazan's Gym, where he waited for several hours, until Kazan and other members from their Russian Mafia arrived. Castle kept watch, until Turk Barrett had then arrived into the gym, as they had agreed, as Castle watched while Barrett then spoke to Kazan about arranging a meeting with Sergei Konchevsky. However, Castle then witnessed the Russian grabbing Barrett and kidnapping him, although Castle chose not to help Barrett.

Castle finding that Amy Bendix is still relaxing
Leaving Barrett behind, Castle returned into the Apartment, where he had then found Amy Bendix surrounded by various boxes of food, as he questioned where it had all come from, to which Bendix explained that she had it all delivered. Bendix then presented Castle with some clothes that she had bought him, noting that she had got him black as it seemed to be his style. As Castle questioned who had paid for the food and clothes, Bendix then revealed that she had used Dinah Madani's credit card, while Castle questioned if she had really stolen from the woman who had let them stay inside of her apartment.

Castle listening to Turk Barrett over the phone
However, before Castle could continue to berate Bendix, he noticed that she had ordered pizza and became distracted, while Bendix had questioned what things had gone at Kazan's Gym. Just as Castle got a slice of pizza, his phone began to ring, white he got Bendix to grab it out of his pocket and answered it, to see that it was Barrett calling him back. Barrett had claimed that the meeting with Konchevsky had been successful, as Castle had continued playing ignorant and they discussed completing their dealings at Barrett's shop, despite Castle knowing that Barrett had already been captured by the Russians.

Castle listening to Amy Bendix's hypothesis
As Bendix noted that Barrett's suggestion seemed risky, Castle had then noted that he was lying through his teeth. While Castle ate the pizza, Bendix claimed that none of the angles seemed to match up in this situation, noting how Marlena Olin's crew had turned up in Lola's Roadhouse straight after she spoke with Konchevsky, while she then questioned why Konhevsky had not gone there to kill her himself, as he could have done it quietly without drawing any additional attention to this, as she also had then noted that none of Olin's crews who had attacked her, or John Pilgrim, were Russian which made no sense.

Castle getting Amy Bendix to remove his cast
They had agreed that Konchevsky was likely already dead and Castle was walking into a trap by going to meet with Barrett and Kazan, but Castle insisted that he would go in regardless to get answers, noting that he could turn their situation into his own trap which the Russians would not see coming. Before he went out onto the mission, Bendix then helped Castle remove the plaster cast from his broken wrist, as she noted that it still did not look good, although Castle insisted that it would be found and left their Apartment to go to Kazan's Gym and get answers on what exactly had happened with Konchevsky.

Attack on Kazan's Gym
Punisher quietly spying outside Kazan's gym
Standing across the street from the gym, Punisher remained hidden as he then watched several members of the Russian Mafia head out to ambush him. As most of the men had departed, Punisher entered the Gym, where Kazan then asked Turk Barrett if this was his friend, although Barrett insisted that he was no friend of his, while Punisher had questioned who was waiting to kill him at Barrett's Shop, while Kazan had then questioned what the Punisher had to do with the Chicago business.

Punisher asking about Sergei Konchevsky
Kazan questioned if Punisher had killed Sergei Konchevsky, which he denied and asked the same question back, although Kazan insisted that Konchevsky was his nephew and he would have never hurt him. Punisher noted that John Pilgrim had killed Konchevsky, noting that Pilgrim was also hunting down Amy Bendix and some photographs, as he demanded that Kazan start talking. However, Kazan noted that he was not the one who would be talking, before he had then turned to the Russian, ordering them to subdue Punisher but keep him alive, while the Punisher had then readied himself for the upcoming fight.

Punisher getting ambushed by the Russians
Standing up to the Russian, the Punisher was asked if he was ready, as he told him to come at him, as the Russian threw a punch, which Punisher immediately avoid, hitting the Russian in the crotch, before grabbing his open mouth and slamming his face onto the floor. This caused the Russians to join the fight, as Punisher was kicked in the back by Vor, pushing him into another man who he had knocked into a barbel. Punisher then found himself being held back, forcing him to fight two men at the same time, before being lifted up into the air and then slammed down onto the floor with some considerable force.

Punisher fighting against Vor and the others
Using whatever weapons were closest to him, Punisher grabbed one dumbbell and began striking the Russians on their knees and across the face to subdue them, only for another Russian to smash an entire bench across Punisher's back, knocking him back down while Kazan ordered his men to keep fighting. When the Russian threw the bench at him, Punisher managed to dodge out of the way before picking up a kettlebell and throwing it directly at that man's head. Continuing to fight as hard as he could, Punisher then subdued two other Russians by punching one while also swinging the barbel at another's head.

Punisher furiously fighting all of Kazan's men
However, Punisher then saw the Russian was getting back up, as he grabbed a steel plate to defend himself, as the Russian then swung the barbel at him, before Punisher smashed him across the face and broke another man's leg. However, this still did not slow the Russian down, as he proceeded to charge straight at Punisher, knocking him off his feet. With only the Punisher and the Russian left from the fight, the pair briefly paused to size each other up, before charging at one another, with the Russian managing to push Punisher against the wall while taking little notice of the Punisher's attempts to break his grip.

Punisher getting overpowered by the Russian
Gaining the advantage in the fight, the Russian then head-butted the Punisher, before throwing him across the room, as the Punisher had then attempting to kick the Russian in the chest, but finding that this had no effect on his opponent what so ever, who had then managed to pick the Punisher back up and slammed him back down onto the floor again. The Punisher was then kicked in the side, as the Russian dragged him back onto his feet by his hair and proceeded to punch him across the face repeatedly, with the Punisher struggling to stay conscious as he was then brutally beaten down by the Russian.
