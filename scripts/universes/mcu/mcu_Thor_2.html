<html><p>As the Asgardians celebrated the defeat of the Frost Giants and the return of their prince, Thor took time to himself, still mourning the death of his brother Loki while thinking about the loss of Jane Foster and if he would ever be reunited with her. Leaving Volstagg and Fandral to tell the stories of their victory against Loki's schemes, Thor quietly left, touching Frigga's hand gently as he walked outside.

Thor and Odin think of the future of Asgard
Thor went to see King Odin, who was also thinking of Loki and still mourning his death. Standing beside his father, Thor told him that he was wrong for his prior actions and that he had a lot to learn from him, hoping to make him proud someday before he took the throne of Asgard. Odin in return told Thor that he would be a wise king and that he had already made him proud by proving himself worthy of wielding Mjølnir once again and returning back home at last.

Thor considers how to see Jane Foster again
Thor then went to see Heimdall, who was stood where Himinbjorg's had once been, with Thor asking if there was now any hope of repairing the Rainbow Bridge as Heimdall told him there was always hope. Thor asked about Jane Foster and Heimdall replied that she was looking for a way to find her way to Asgard. Not long after the defeat of Loki, the Nine Realms were endangered by Marauders, which had put Vanaheim, the home of Hogun in danger of invasion.

Chitauri Invasion
Returning to the Earth
Thor finally locates his brother's whereabouts
Having discovered that Loki was still alive and was hiding on a far-reaching part of the galaxy through Frigga's success at contacting him, Thor learned he was planning an attack on Earth involving the Tesseract and an army of Chitauri. As a result, Thor was sent to Earth by Odin's use of dark energy to find his brother, landing on the top of a mountain. Thor caused a lightning storm while he landed on the Quinjet in which Loki was being escorted on.

Thor takes Loki back into his custody
While the Quinjet was kept steady by Black Widow, Thor proceeded to board the jet and was challenged by Iron Man who feared that Thor may be attempting to aid and possibly kill Loki before they could find out his plan. However, Thor easily dispatched Iron Man by striking him with Mjølnir, which had caused him to crash into Captain America before Thor then ripped Loki out of his restraints and freeing him from their custody and flying off into the distance with his brother to then question Loki personally, while leaving both Captain America and Iron Man stunned as they considered what to do next. 

Thor attempts to convince Loki to surrender
Once they crash landed onto a mountain, Thor tried to convince Loki to give up his plans and return to Asgard with the Tesseract, though Loki still resented Thor. Thor attempted to reason with his brother by expressing his relief to learn he had survived and informed him that both he and Odin had mourned his death, although the mention of Odin only angered Loki further. It was during their conversation that Thor learned Loki was working for another party, although he never learned who it was. When Loki continued to mock him and refused to answer him, Thor picked up Mjølnir and threatened him.

Confronted by Iron Man
Thor is violently confronted by the Iron Man
Before Thor could make another threat, however, Iron Man suddenly attacked him and threw him off the cliff. Having recovered from the sudden surprise attack, Thor told him never to touch him again while Iron Man told him not to take his stuff, although Thor argued that Iron Man clearly had no clue what he was getting involved with, promising that Loki would face Asgardian justice at Odin's hand upon returning home. Iron Man remained unmovable in his view, rudely calling Thor Shakespeare in the Park and claiming he was wearing his mother's clothes before he told Thor to stay out of their way.

Thor summons his lightning into Mjølnir
Seeing that Iron Man would not listen, Thor attacked by launching Mjølnir at him and preparing to return to Loki who was watching the skirmish with great amusement. However, rather than being defeated by the blow, Iron Man responded by shooting Thor with his repulsor beam and kicking him through a tree. Wishing to end the fight, Thor fired a blast of lightning at the Avenger thinking it would damage it beyond repair. However, J.A.R.V.I.S. informed Iron Man that the blast only served to power his suit to incredible levels, allowing him to shoot back at Thor once again, knocking him back with more force.

Thor attempts to crush Iron Man's armor
Iron Man fought back and the two traded blows, flying across the mountain ranges and destroying much of the forest in a desperate attempt to stop the other. Upon crash landing, they punched at each other and managed to catch each other's fists, resulting in a standoff as Thor began crushing Iron Man's Armor. Iron Man responded by shooting Thor in the face and head-butting him, which Thor then responded to with a headbutt of his own while trying to strike his foe with Mjølnir while Iron Man used speed to his advantage, flying all across the battlefield and hitting Thor before he could react.

Thor meets Iron Man and Captain America
When Captain America intervened and broke up the fight, he pointed out that they should not be fighting with each other. When he asked Thor to put Mjølnir down, Thor erupted into a rage and in response, Thor knocked Iron Man back and brought Mjølnir down on Captain America, who blocked it with his shield which absorbed the impact, sending Thor flying backwards. As the warriors recovered from the shockwave, Thor realized, upon seeing all the destruction he had helped to cause, that they had the same goal to stop Loki's plan and protect Earth, so stopped fighting and formed an alliance.

Working with S.H.I.E.L.D.
Thor onboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier
They returned to the Helicarrier, where Loki was put inside a cell designed to hold and dispose of Hulk if necessary. Thor joined the rest of the team as they watched while Nick Fury questioned Loki, with Thor's brother refusing to give up the location of the Tesseract and mocking their efforts to stop him. With the interrogation over, Thor revealed to the team that Loki had now gathered an entire army of the Chitauri who were not from Asgard or any other realm known to him. To his shock, Thor learned that Loki had kidnapped Hawkeye as well as Erik Selvig for his schemes, telling them that Selvig was a friend of his. 

Thor explains Loki's plan and motivations
When Bruce Banner insulted Loki, calling him crazy, Thor was quick to point out that while Loki was unstable, he was his brother, though Black Widow brought up that Loki had killed several people, so Thor quickly reasserted that Loki was adopted. (No doubt to erase any suspicions that he could be capable of equally evil actions like Loki.) The group was joined by Tony Stark who explained what Loki needed Selvig for while teasing Thor for their earlier fight, calling him Point Break while they all began searching for Loki across the entire globe.

Thor and Phil Coulson on board the Helicarrier
Later, he asked Agent Phil Coulson about Jane Foster and was told that she was moved into a secure location when Loki returned and Selvig was put under his control. Thor personally thanked Coulson for this action to protect the woman he loved and discussed how he viewed Selvig as a good man, noting that Loki would have targeted him due to their friendship, with Coulson explaining that Selvig often spoke of his own encounter with Thor.

Thor discusses Loki's personal hatred for him
Thor expressed his displeasure at the way the Asgardians claimed to be a more advanced race within the Nine Realms but now their own Wars would often be fought on Earth, leaving the humans to pay the price, comparing their wars to the fights of the Bilgesnipe, but he did have to explain to Coulson what the Bilgesnipe were and how they trample everything within their path. Thor noted how Loki's rage had followed him to New Mexico where he had fought the Destroyer to protect innocent lives. Thor noted that in his youth he had desired war, but seeing the reality had now changed his views.

Thor discusses Loki with Director Nick Fury
Their conversation was interrupted when Fury then approached and asked Thor if he believed he could make him confess where the Tesseract was, but Thor insisted that all Loki really desired was his revenge against his family for Odin's lies about his true heritage. Fury then asked what Thor was prepared to do in order to keep all Loki's plans from reaching fruition, though Thor told him that he was still unsure. When Thor noted that Loki was still their prisoner, Fury noted that Loki clearly had his plans, as he appeared to be the only person onboard the Helicarrier who actually wanted to be there.

Avengers Argument
Thor argues with all of the other Avengers
Thor rejoined the Avengers alongside Natasha Romanoff inside the laboratory just as an argument was breaking out between them all, as Tony Stark had just now learned that S.H.I.E.L.D. was using the power of the Tesseract to recreate the weapons of HYDRA and had not informed the team of this fact. Director Nick Fury noted that they were building the weapons because of the threat of Asgardians, pointing to Thor who insisted his people wanted peace with Midgard, although Fury noted Asgardians were not the only threat.

Thor laughs at Tony Stark and Steve Rogers
While Stark and Steve Rogers were standing up to each other about what to do next in the wake of all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s own secrets being uncovered, they attempted to start a fight with each other, something Thor found amusing as he called Humans both petty and tiny for getting into such arguments with one another. While Thor argued that their tests on the Tesseract had attracted Loki's attention and the attention of his allies in the first place, their argument was quickly ended as Bruce Banner inadvertently picked up the Scepter, proving Loki was manipulating his mind in order to divide them all.

Attack on the Helicarrier
Thor fights and attempts to reason with Hulk
As Thor and the others argued, Hawkeye, under Loki's mind control, managed to use his trick arrows to blow up one of the Helicarrier's engines, causing a massive fireball to strike into the room which all of the Avengers were in. Thor was knocked back while the blast also triggered Bruce Banner to transform into Hulk. Thor found Hulk moments before he would have killed Black Widow, knocking him through a wall. Thor fought Hulk, being the only one who could match him for strength, as Thor held off Hulk's massive arm, Thor tried and failed to reason with Banner, hoping he was still inside Hulk's mind.

Thor regains Mjølnir to get more power
Hulk, however, then managed to lift up Thor and punched him through the hanger, causing Thor's nose to bleed from the impact of such a powerful punch. Unafraid of the beast and it's incredible strength, Thor summoned Mjølnir to his hand and used it to strike Hulk across the face, knocking him into a jet. Thor soon learned that these sorts of attacks only added to Hulk's rage as he ripped the Jet apart and threw it at Thor. As a result, Thor used Mjølnir to pin Hulk to the ground before trying to choke him out with all of his might while Hulk lets out a mighty roar of anger while he tried to escape Thor's grasp.

Thor strikes Hulk hard across the face
As their battle continued while Captain America and Iron Man still attempted to fix the Helicarrier and keep it from falling out of the sky, Hulk started to gain the upper hand against Thor and threw him around like a ragdoll across the ship. Eventually, Thor was aided as a single S.H.I.E.L.D. jet, sent by Nick Fury, fired upon Hulk. Thor managed to avoid the bullets while the furious Hulk then turned his attention to the Jet, which caused him to leap from the Helicarrier and rip it from the sky, falling to Earth as a result, saving Thor from further beatings from the Incredible Hulk's fury.

Thor falls for Loki's illusion tricks again
With the threat of Hulk's incredible rage finally over, Thor then went to make sure that Loki was still being contained inside the Helicarrier. When he arrived, however, Thor discovered that the cell door was being opened and Loki was leaving, Thor desperately tried to stop Loki from leaving, but it turned out to be an illusion and Thor became trapped in the cell, as Loki looked upon his brother and mocked him for once again falling for his deceptions. Thor tried to break the glass, but this caused the cell to almost fall from the sky as Loki then mocked Thor's dangerous current situation.

Thor watches Loki murdering Phil Coulson
Loki threatened to drop the cage, noting how the humans believed that Asgardians were immortal and he wished to test the theory by sending Thor falling to his death. However, Loki was just about to drop the cage when Phil Coulson confronted him with the Destroyer Armor Prototype Gun which had been created from the remains that had been gathered from the Destroyer. However, before Coulson could recapture Loki and free Thor, Loki used another illusion to get behind Coulson stabbed him through the heart, as Thor yelled out in anger at seeing his ally mortally wounded and slowly dying.

Thor manages to escape falling to his death
Thor looked on helplessly as Loki then showed him Agent Coulson's blood still on his Scepter's blade before he then dropped him out of the Helicarrier, wishing to finally kill his own brother once and for all. As he plummeted towards Earth at incredible speeds, Thor was thrown from side to side and was still unable to hit the glass, but he eventually managed to secure himself against a wall and used the power of Mjølnir to smash free from the cell's solid glass walls just in time to avoid the impact as the cell smashed against some rocks and was completely destroyed as a direct result of the crash.

Thor is briefly unworthy to pick up Mjølnir
Having escaped the impact of the near-deadly crash landing, Thor landed heavily in an empty field, dropping Mjølnir upon his hard landing on the Earth. Afterwards, having been separated from the rest of the Avengers and wishing to continue the battle to stop the Chitauri Invasion, Thor then went looking for Mjølnir. When Thor eventually found and then tried to pick his mighty hammer up again, he learned his connection to Mjølnir had temporarily been severed due to his rage after witnessing Loki murder his friend as well as causing such massive destruction across the realm that Thor loved.

Thor regaining all his strength from Mjølnir
Thor managed to calm himself down as he clenched his own fist and recalled the lessons taught to him by King Odin. He then picked up the hammer and regained his power by summoning a lightning bolt from the heavens, which gifted him not only with his great power back, but a new battle armor which then fell from the heavens and wrapped itself around Thor. Now ready for battle, Thor then went searching for both Loki and the rest of the Avengers, who were all currently in New York City, in order to complete his mission to stop Loki's plans for complete world domination.

Confronting Loki
Thor attempts to stop Loki's schemes
Having recovered, Thor used Mjølnir's powers to replenish his own strength before he went to New York City to confront Loki. Upon arriving at Stark Tower once Loki had used the Tesseract to open a portal allowing the Chitauri and Leviathans to invade Earth, Thor confronted his brother while Iron Man clashed with the invading Chitauri. Giving Loki a final warning, Thor ordered him to turn off the Tesseract or he would destroy it, only for Loki to tell him it could not be destroyed.

Thor fights Loki on top of Stark Tower
Seeing that Loki could not be stopped, Thor prepared himself as Loki leapt off Stark Tower and attacked him with the Scepter, with Thor using Mjølnir to defend himself as all of their blows caused massive damage to the Tower while Loki destroyed the Avengers' Quinjet and causing it to crash. While locked in their battle, Thor again tried to convince him to stop, since the Chitauri were destroying the world he wanted to rule, telling him the madness of the battle would not end with his rule. Loki told Thor it was too late to stop the carnage but Thor told him they could find a way to do it together.

Thor soon overpowers and defeats Loki
Although Loki appeared to relent, smiling with tears in his eyes at Thor's promise, he instead revealed a hidden blade and stabbed his brother in the side, mocking him for all his sentiment. Furious, Thor attacked Loki and beat him into submission, lifting him high into the air before slamming his body painfully onto the ground. Thor prepared to capture Loki and end the Chitauri Invasion, only to witness Loki escape as he fled on a Chitauri Chariot. With his brother now flying across the battlefield, Thor removed the blade from in his side and prepared to join his new allies in defeating the Chitauri.

Battle of New York
Thor rejoins the other remaining Avengers
Having seen that he could no longer catch up with Loki and wishing to protect the innocent lives of the people in New York City, Thor rejoined the other Avengers onto the battlefield, bringing down his lightning to destroy a small band of Chitauri fighters. Upon joining the others, Thor explained that the Tesseract was impenetrable before noting that he still planned on defeating Loki, to which Hawkeye expressed his own desire to get revenge on the God of Mischief. Captain America ordered them to stay focused until he heard a now incoming motorcycle.

Thor listens to Captain America's orders
Seeing that Bruce Banner was riding the motorcycle, the Avengers greeted their ally who noted how horrible the Battle of New York was. While Thor looked on, Banner personally challenged an incoming Leviathan by transforming into Hulk and destroying it, with Thor blocking the explosion with his own arm. Captain America then took command of all of the Avengers and gave them each their mission plans for the battle, ordering Thor to use all his power of lightning to stem the flow of enemies coming through the portal, which Thor then agreed to without question as he flew into position.

Thor using his lightning to block the portal
Following Captain America's new orders for him, Thor then flew onto the top of the Chrysler Building where he used the building to charge his lightning bolts into Mjølnir before unleashing them onto the portal, destroying much of Loki's entire oncoming army, causing massive explosions that killed many of the incoming Leviathans that were attempting to attack New York City as well as the oncoming horde of Chitauri Chariots. However, this incredible use of power took its toll on Thor and he was forced to stop and continue the battle on the ground alongside all of his own fellow Avengers.

Thor and Hulk after killing a large Leviathan
While flying around in New York City, Iron Man asked Thor if he had ever seen Game of Thrones, saying he reminded him of it. Thor then asked Iron Man how he could make jokes in the middle of a war. He later helped Hulk bring down a Leviathan; they fought the Chitauri army on top of the beast until together they ripped out a section of its armor and rammed it into its skull, killing the beast and causing it to crash into Grand Central Station. As the pair were both taking a moment to catch their breath, Hulk punched Thor across the room in revenge for their earlier fight, smugly chuckling to himself.

Thor rides onboard a flying Chitauri Chariot
As the battle raged on, the more powerful Thor then attempted to use his own Asgardian strength and skills to destroy the enemies flying through the sky. Therefore, Thor sought to bring down the Chitauri Chariots that were flying through the city, but while riding on the back of one Chariot, Thor was knocked off when a Leviathan smashed through a building and knocked him off his feet. With the forces taking over the city, Thor was forced to join the Avengers in taking on the army of seemingly unending foot soldiers, beating them back despite the overwhelming odds against them all.

Closing the Portal
Thor fighting alongside Captain America
Thor then joined forces with Captain America during a skirmish with a unit of Chitauri soldiers. During the fight, Rogers received a shot to his side which knocked him down, Thor defended his fellow Avenger by using Mjølnir to throw a car at the incoming soldiers before then throwing it in the opposite direction to knock out other soldiers. Thor helped Rogers to his feet and asked if he was ready to continue fighting, to which Rogers jokingly asked him if he was sleepy. Seeing that Rogers was indeed prepared to fight now until the end, Thor reclaimed Mjølnir.

Thor and Captain America watch Iron Man fall from space
Soon Gideon Malick and all of the World Security Council made the decision to send a nuclear missile into the heart of the city, intending to destroy the portal at the sacrifice of everyone in the city. Iron Man sent the missile intended for the city through the portal, which then destroyed the Chitauri Command Center, cutting off the forces power source and killing them, while Black Widow closed the portal. Thor and Captain America watched as Iron Man fell from the sky before Thor could catch him, Hulk then launched through the air and caught Stark before dropping him off at the Avengers' feet.

Thor speaks to Iron Man after the battle
To see if their ally had died due to his lack of air while in space, Thor ripped off Stark's mask and for a moment it appeared he had been killed; however, a roar from Hulk soon awoke him with a shocking start. Thor deemed them not to be finished until Loki was finally captured, although Stark requested that they go eat shawarma as soon as possible. Thor joined the other Avengers in confronting Loki, who had already been heavily wounded and battered by Hulk, and took him into custody.

Returning to Asgard
Thor meets Alexander Pierce
As they apprehended Loki, a group of STRIKE operatives who were HYDRA sleeper agents in disguise including Brock Rumlow, Jasper Sitwell, and Jack Rollins arrived at the Stark Tower, taking the Scepter into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, which ultimately fell into the hands of HYDRA's Eastern European division led by Wolfgang von Strucker, unbeknownst to the Avengers. As Tony Stark and Thor exited the building, they were approached by Alexander Pierce, who demanded Thor to hand over Loki and the Tesseract. Despite the Secretary's demand, Thor was allowed to take both the Tesseract and Loki back to Asgard.

Thor returns to Asgard with the captured Loki
Thor and the other Avengers went into the Shawarma Palace and ate silently. They were soon interrupted by War Machine, who arrived just too late to help fight in their battle. After being allowed to reclaim the Tesseract by Nick Fury, despite the many objections of Gideon Malick, Thor said goodbye to the Avengers and Erik Selvig before taking Loki with him back to Asgard to await his trial by opening a portal with the Tesseract and leaving all the other Avengers in Central Park.

War of the Nine Realms
Battle of Vanaheim
Thor battling the invading Marauders army
Having brought Loki back to Asgard, Thor discovered that Vanaheim was getting slowly taken over by Marauders who were now taking advantage of the chaotic time. Thor gave Heimdall the Tesseract so he that could use its energy to repair the Rainbow Bridge so that the Asgardians could access the Bifrost Bridge once more in order to protect the Nine Realms once again. He then, with an army of Asgardians, went to end the threats controlling the Nine Realms. In 2011, a group of ragtag invaders known as the Marauders started a war across all the Nine Realms. Thor, now a full-time general of the Asgardian army, bravely led all of his own forces in a fight against the attackers.

Thor protects Vanaheim from Marauders
With Lady Sif and the Warriors Three, they teamed up to and fought the invading army. When Thor arrived on the battlefield in Vanaheim, the homeworld of Hogun, the battle was already underway and Thor used his lightning to create a shockwave that knocked down a small band of the Marauders. Lady Sif insisted that she had the situation completely under control, but Thor only teased her by noting that everything around her was on fire before being attacked.

Thor is challenged by a Kronan Marauder
As the battle continued, Thor and Sif fought side by side until the battle paused when a Kronan Marauder appeared and challenged Thor to single combat. The Marauders celebrated as they believed Thor would be unable to defeat the monster. Sif allowed Thor to fight it alone and Thor calmly joked that he accepted its surrender. When the monster appeared to still want to fight, Thor killed it with a single blow from Mjølnir, which caused the invaders to surrender.

Thor and Hogun say farewell after a battle
With this final victory, the two-year war with the Marauders was over and the Asgardians restored peace to the Nine Realms while all the invaders were taken to the Asgardian Dungeons. As the people of Vanaheim returned to their homes, Thor spoke to Hogun, telling him to stay there with his people to help them recover from the battle, for which Hogun was very grateful for the thought. The pair shook hands before Thor then left Vanaheim via the Bifrost Bridge.

Celebration
Thor seeks some advice from Odin
With Vanaheim now safe, along with Nornheim and Ria, and all the remaining Marauders having been rounded up and all then sent into the Asgardian Dungeons for the foreseeable future, Thor and all his allies then returned to Asgard to update his father, King Odin on their success. Thor noted that they would have had their victory much earlier if Odin had joined them on the battlefield, only for Odin to question why Thor was still harboring his own feelings for Jane Foster, noting that it was foolish for an Asgardian to love a mortal human woman.

Thor considers his own future as king
Thor returned to his own room within the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf where he bathed to prepare for the upcoming celebrations for the Asgardian's recent victory in the War of the Nine Realms. However, instead of being joyful, Thor remained melancholy as he stepped to his window and looked out over Asgard, considering if his future remained there as King of Asgard, or if he should return to Earth to reunite with his new allies, the Avengers and pursue a future with Foster.

Thor drinks with Volstagg and Fandral
A party was held for Thor for restoring the peace throughout the Nine Realms, which soon moved into one of the caverns within Asgard. While Volstagg and Fandral both remained in high spirits, drinking and telling war stories about the many adventures and other battles involving the Warriors Three with the beautiful women as well as Volstagg's children, Thor remained somewhat silent throughout the celebration and soon left the party, allowing his friends to continue enjoying themselves as Volstagg smashed his glass on the floor and demanded another drink, leading to many joyful cheers.

Thor speaks with Lady Sif after their battle
Before he could leave, Thor was stopped by Lady Sif who reminded him of how they used to celebrate their victories for weeks at a time, as they reminisced about a previous battle in Harokin which Sif had almost restarted during the celebration of their victory. Sif then asked him if he would have a drink with her, noting that Odin could not have another task for him at this time; he kindly refused and thanked her for her company, telling her that this was a task he had given unto himself, not from the Allfather. Sif, however, noted that the future King of Asgard should focus on all the Realms, not just Midgard which she knew was his reason for leaving the celebrations early.

Thor asks Heimdall about Jane Foster
He walked to the end of the Rainbow Bridge and arrived at Himinbjorg where he was greeted by the Guardian of Asgard as they discussed the Nine Realms and his ability to see all the souls throughout it. Once again, Thor asked Heimdall to see how Jane Foster was doing back on Earth. Heimdall told Thor that Foster was indeed smart and was studying the Convergence: however, to his surprise, he found himself currently unable to see her.

Second Dark Elf Conflict
Protecting Jane Foster
Thor returns to Earth to find Jane Foster
Fearing for her safety, Thor returned to Earth and then went to finally reunite with Jane Foster to ensure that she was okay. Using the information gathered, Thor knew that Foster was in London and soon found her, at which point Foster noticed a circle of rain around her; then Thor appeared.

Thor is finally reunited with Jane Foster
Foster slapped him in the face to check if he was real, and then one more time for taking three years to visit her even though he was on Earth during the Battle of New York. Thor noted that he had spent the time battling against the Marauders who had threatened the Nine Realms while keeping the peace throughout Asgard, an excuse that Foster soon accepted as Thor noted that he had done everything within his power to protect her from dangers of the universe.

Thor takes Jane Foster to Asgard
While Darcy Lewis also caught up with Thor and asked how space was doing, one of the police officers at the scene attempted to arrest Foster, Lewis and Ian Boothby for trespassing, he was blown back by the Aether which had bonded with Foster's body and was giving her seemingly uncontrollable power. Seeking to get her some aid, Thor grabbed Foster to returned to Asgard with her, calling on Heimdall to summon the Bifrost Bridge to them and return him home.

Thor takes Jane Foster to be checked on
Wishing to get her medical aid, Thor had Eir take Foster and use the Soul Forge to analyze Foster's condition, with Thor being amused by Foster's constant questions of how Asgardian technology worked. They were then interrupted when Odin arrived in the room to tell him to take Foster back to Earth despite Thor's protests. However, when the guards attempted to remove her, they were all once again blown backward by the Aether's incredible power coming from her.

Thor learns of Malekith and the Dark Elves
Seeing the potential danger, Odin took Thor and Foster away and showed them the Book of Yggdrasil which explained to them that the Aether was created by the Dark Elves from the Reality Stone thousands of years ago as their greatest leader, Malekith, had attempted to use it's power to destroy the universe before being defeated by Bor who wiped out the Dark Elves. When Foster asked how to be freed from the Aether before it killed her, Odin confessed to not knowing how to do that.

Thor walks Jane Foster through Asgard
Seeking to understand more of the Aether's power and hoping to save her, Odin allowed Foster to stay in Asgard until the Aether could be safely removed from her. Thor and Foster spent time together in Asgard, exploring their culture, and Thor explained to her the story behind the Convergence which had caused her to come in contact with the Aether through the Nine Realms, vowing to use his great power to protect her from harm despite his own father's wishes. They shared a kiss and were interrupted by Thor's mother Frigga, who teased them both while Thor introduced her to Foster, much to Foster's great awkward amazement which Thor enjoyed.

Thor hears of a riot breaking out in Asgard
Thor made the introductions but while they were talking, Algrim had used the power of a Kursed Stone to give himself new power and break himself and many others free of the Asgardian Dungeons. Thor soon became distracted by an alarm at the dungeons, and knowing that Loki was also there and fearing for his escape. Frigga promised to look after Foster while Thor summoned Mjølnir and flew towards the Dungeons to investigate the still ongoing chaos.

Sacking of Asgard
Thor battles all of the escaped prisoners
When the Dark Elves invaded Asgard, Thor then flew into battle and, using his reputation as a greatly feared Asgardian warrior, ordered the prisoners to stop their current riot and then return to their cells within the Asgardian Dungeons. However, when they refused and continued to fight, Thor battled them alongside Volstagg, Fandral and the remaining prison guards, noting that the prisoners no longer had their word that they would not harm them during the battle. Throughout the ensuing skirmish, Loki remained in his cell, reading a book, and did not get involved in the conflict, much to Thor's own great personal relief.

Thor hears the arrival of the Dark Elves
Having helped to quell the riot, Thor was unable to stop the Dark Elf Harrows from flying past Heimdall's warships, as Kurse destroyed Asgard's defenses and allowed their ships to attack. Thor felt the entire palace shake as Malekith's ship crash-landed in the Great Hall. Thor continued assisting the Warriors Three in securing all the remaining prisoners as the Einherjar battled the Dark Elves who used their own small army to charge through the palace.

Thor attempts to kill Malekith
Thor ran to the aid of his people and arrived just in time to witness his own mother, Frigga, fall down bleeding on the ground from being stabbed in the heart by Kurse. In great anger, Thor burned half of Malekith's face off with a lightning bolt and then threw his hammer, Mjølnir, into Kurse and Malekith, sending them back to their Ark ship and repelling the invasion, although Thor was unable to kill either of them or destroy their ship before it vanished from view.

Thor looks down at his mother Frigga's body
Now too late to do anything more, Thor summoned Mjølnir back to his hand just as Odin arrived in the room armed with Gungnir only to find his own beloved wife dead. Jane Foster also appeared from her hiding place, as Frigga had used her magic to hide her and sacrificed her own life to protect hers. Thor then just watched as his father fell to his knees and cradled Frigga's lifeless body in his arms, mourning the loss of his wife who had been with him for centuries.

Recruiting his Allies
Thor and Jane Foster attend Frigga's funeral
In the wake of the Sacking of Asgard, a funeral was later held for the dead Asgardians and Queen Frigga. Thor attended and with Jane Foster by his side, he watched his mother transform into stars into the Multiverse as the Asgardians showed their respects to their late Queen.

Thor debates what to do with Malekith
Thor knew that Malekith would soon return for the Aether, and, once he learned that King Odin had locked Foster away in Asgard. Thor interrupted a military meeting as he desperately tried to convince Odin that Malekith would return and destroy Asgard in order to get the Aether. Thor explained his plan to trick Malekith by taking him away from Asgard and then destroy the Aether himself, but, blinded by hate and grief, Odin would not let Thor move her.

Thor argues with King Odin
Odin then told Thor that he planned to fight a new war with the Dark Elves, as his own father Bor had done until they were wiped from existence. However, during their argument, it became clear that Odin was becoming weaker and uneasy on his feet. When Odin swore that the Asgardians would fight until the last breath and noted he believed they would win, Thor knew in his heart that they would not win a war with Malekith's great army of undetectable Dark Elves. 

Thor quietly asks for Heimdall's assistance
Disheartened by Odin's orders not to seek out Malekith himself, Thor then devised a plan to move her even if he would then commit treason and in the worst case get them killed. Meeting Heimdall at one of Asgard's caverns, they discussed how Heimdall could no longer see the Dark Elves and the Bifrost Bridge had been closed off. Thor spoke to Heimdall about Malekith and the Dark Elves, noting that Odin's decision was a poor one made out of both his hatred and mourning and requested Heimdall's aid in getting himself and Foster off-world, if he could keep quiet. Heimdall agreed to help, despite knowing this action would be considered high treason.

Thor secretly meets with the Warriors Three
Since Loki managed to get three Frost Giants into Asgard, Thor hoped that he could take them to Svartalfheim to ambush Malekith. Seeking more allies for his mission, Thor gathered Lady Sif and the Warriors Three for a secret meeting where he explained to them his plan to free Loki, much to Volstagg's horror while Fandral then reminded him that Loki would more than likely betray him yet again, which Thor acknowledged was true but remained confident.

Freeing Loki
Thor makes a deal with Loki in his prison cell
Thor traveled into the Asgardian Dungeons and spoke to Loki. Thor knew that Loki was maintaining an illusion and forced him to reveal the truth, that Loki had trashed his cell with grief upon learning of Frigga's death at the hands of Kurse, who he had aided. Thor promised Loki that if he had helped him then he would free him from his cell and grant him revenge for their mother's death. Loki agreed.

Thor breaking Loki out of the dungeons
Thor and Loki made their escape through the halls of Asgard, to remain unnoticed Loki then disguised himself as a Einherjar guard. However, when it became clear he was now annoying Thor with his constant talking, Loki decided to have more fun and changed Thor's appearance into Lady Sif and his own into Captain America, mocking Thor as he went about his friendship with the Avengers as he joked about Captain America's own grand patriotism.

Thor sneakily puts handcuffs on Loki
Losing his patience, Thor pinned Loki against a wall when he spotted some guards, Loki requested his dagger but Thor instead gave him a brand new pair of handcuffs, teasingly reminding Loki about how he normally enjoyed tricks like that. When they became corned by more Einherjar guards, Thor dropped Mjølnir and informed Loki that he did not intend to kill his Asgardian allies. Thor then proceeded to subdue the guards with just his own bare hands.

Escape from Asgard
Thor gets some assistance from Lady Sif
Thor and Loki then regrouped with Lady Sif who had successfully rescued Jane Foster while Heimdall was still distracting Odin within Himinbjorg. Once Thor had thanked Sif and Volstagg for agreeing to stay behind and keep the Einherjar at bay, he, Foster and Loki boarded the Dark Elf Harrow which had crashed in the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf. Sif and Volstagg both first personally took the chance to threaten Loki.

Thor and Loki on the Dark Elf Harrow
While Sif and Volstagg delayed the guards, Thor attempted to get the Dark Elf Harrow going, while Loki continued to criticize him, much to Thor's great annoyance. Once they got going, Thor flew the Harrow across Asgard with the Einherjar chasing after him. Loki continued mocking him, especially when he destroyed a statue of Bor. Nearing their exit point, Thor flew out beside the Bifrost Bridge, pushed out Loki and jumped out himself with a sick Foster in his arms.

Thor gets away with Fandral's assistance
They all landed on a smaller Asgardian Skiff that Fandral had been driving as Loki noted how impressed he was that Thor had actually managed to trick him. They were hunted by an Asgardian patrol, but Fandral went over to their ship and knocked out the soldiers, allowing them to get away without being seen. Loki then took control of the Skiff and drove through the secret passageway that took them to Svartalfheim, delighting in his great success.

Fighting Malekith
Thor promises to still protect Jane Foster
The trio successfully landed in the wastelands of Svartalfheim where they explored the remains from the First Battle of Svartalfheim. As they moved through the wreckage of various Arks, Thor cared for Jane Foster as she slowly regained all of her strength. Loki began to mock Thor about his love for a mortal woman, noting that she would die long before he would, when Thor asked if this would satisfy him, Loki claimed satisfaction was not within his nature.

Thor argues with Loki yet again
Thor noted that surrender was not in his nature as Loki accused him of locking him in the Asgardian Dungeons. This lead to an intense argument between the two leading to Thor nearly punching his own brother. He stepped back when he thought how Frigga would not want them to fight. Loki, however, said she would not be surprised. They shared a laugh and started to talk about wanting to trust Loki; Loki told him to trust his rage as they continued onward.

Thor notes that he still does not trust Loki
They made their way through Svartalfheim and, while sitting on a cliff top, they all saw Malekith stepping out of his ship with all of his small army of Dark Elves. Having already made a plan to deceive Malekith to gain the upper hand, Thor unlocked Loki's handcuffs while Loki once again asked Thor if he trusted him when Thor asked if he would trust himself, Loki said he could not as he drew his own dagger from just underneath his own long cloak.

Loki pretends to slice off Thor's own hand
Loki then proceeded to use his dagger to stab Thor in the side and throw him off a cliff where he rolled to the feet of the Dark Elves. He kicked and beat Thor while claiming he only ever wanted both him and Odin dead at his feet before cutting Thor's hand off. Malekith, who had been there waiting for them, listened as Loki told him that all he wanted in return for the gift of both Foster and the Aether was a good spot where he could see Asgard burn down.

Thor using his lightning to destroy the Aether
As Malekith was unsure of Loki, Kurse then stepped forward and remembered seeing Loki during the Sacking of Asgard, so he told Malekith that Loki was an enemy of Asgard. Malekith then began to draw the Aether from Foster but while he was still absorbing it, Thor shouted Loki's name. Loki had only created an illusion of cutting off Thor's arm and Thor called for Mjølnir. He then shot a lightning bolt on the Aether, causing it to then explode.

Thor sees the Malekith absorb the Aether
Loki jumped on top of Foster to prevent the Aether explosion from hitting her while Thor waited to ensure the Aether was indeed destroyed. To his horror, however, the Aether proved to be too powerful due to being one of the Infinity Stones and Malekith then proceeded to absorb it into his own body, becoming vastly more powerful before he turned and left, telling Kurse and some of the Dark Elves to take care of the rest while he was gone.

Thor and Loki prepare to fight together
Seeking to kill them Kurse threw a Black Hole Grenade in the air and, before it could kill Foster, Loki pushed her out of the way and almost got sucked in himself but Thor managed to save him by knocking him out of the sky. Seeing Malekith was about to get away onboard the Ark, Thor left Loki behind with Foster as he then launched himself forward with the power of Mjølnir at the Dark Elf, but was knocked hard out of the way by Kurse's powerful strike.

Thor is beaten into submission by Kurse
Quickly recovering from the powerful strike, Thor role to his feet as Kurse walked towards him and they began to battle each other, with Kurse taking advantage of Thor's surprise at the Dark Elf's strength since using a Kurse Stone. Thor was then thrown into a mountain and had a heavy boulder thrown at him. Kurse even managed to knock Mjølnir off its path before he started to violently beat up Thor, pounding Thor into the ground repeatedly with force.

Thor witnesses Kurse mortally wounding Loki
Before Thor could be beaten to death, however, Loki then stabbed Kurse through the back with a sword. Kurse, being "the last of the Kursed," was not injured and he grabbed Loki and pushed him towards his chest as the blade sticking out of Kurse's chest then pierced Loki's solar plexus, mortally wounding him while Thor could only look on helplessly and cry out for his own brother who was then dismissively thrown down onto the ground by Kurse.

Thor holds Loki as he "dies" in his arms
Despite being mortally wounded and facing a seemingly unstoppable beast, Loki got the last laugh as he managed to press one of Kurse's Black Hole Grenades and said he would see the monster in Hel. Kurse was then killed in the ensuing explosion as his own body was crushed and Thor ran to Loki's aid. As Thor promised to tell Odin of his heroic deeds, Loki said he had not done them for Odin and then seemingly died in Thor's arms, much to his sadness.

Return to Earth
Thor attempts to comfort Jane Foster
As a storm approached Svartalfheim, Thor and Jane Foster took shelter inside a cave as Foster told Thor that Malekith planned to use the Aether's power to destroy the world, having seen it in a vision. Thor comforted her that it was not her fault, but was interrupted when Richard Madison called her on the phone, which seemed to be impossible as she and Madison were separated between realms.

Thor and Jane Foster return to London
Amazed that Madison was calling her all the way from Earth, Foster began exploring the cave for answers while Thor was embarrassed that she was talking to another man. Before long, Foster discovered all the objects that did not come back when she was playing and experimenting with the Convergence at the storage house. This allowed them to find a portal to London where her car was waiting, as Thor then questioned who exactly Madison was.

Thor is reunited with Doctor Erik Selvig
They quickly drove back to the apartment in London where Foster was greeted by Darcy Lewis and Ian Boothby while Thor carefully placed Mjølnir onto the coat rack. Erik Selvig then came over and greeted Thor, who noted Selvig was not wearing pants at the time, which Boothby claimed helped him to think. Selvig then asked if Loki was also with him, but Thor then noted that Loki had been killed by Kurse earlier, which seemed to greatly please Selvig. Thor was not pleased to hear this but understood that Selvig had been put in this state by Loki.

Thor works out a plan to defeat Malekith
The group then stood around a table and discussed Malekith's plans for the Aether, and how he intended to use its power to destroy all the Nine Realms and plunge the Multiverse into eternal darkness. Thor noted that for this to work, Malekith needed to be in a specific location which Selvig realized was in Greenwich in London. Seeking to destroy the Dark Elves,
Thor reclaimed Mjølnir while Selvig then went to put his pants back on as they prepared to leave.

Battle of Greenwich
Thor confronting Malekith within Greenwich
While the Convergence had just finally begun to spread and all of the worlds within the Nine Realms were almost in line, Thor's allies put Gravimetric Spikes around the area ready to disrupt the Convergence as much as possible until Malekith also arrived alongside his army, smashing through the Royal Naval College. Thor landed before Malekith's Ark and the pair faced each other on the battleground, while Malekith told him he should not have come so far as he would soon die regardless.

Thor blocking some of the Aether's power
The two mortal enemies exchanged threats, as Malekith promised to destroy Asgard once he was finished with Earth, before Malekith attempted to kill Thor with the Aether's power. Thor was able to use Mjølnir to deflect the attacks, despite being knocked back by the sheer force of the Infinity Stone. Thor soon recovered and mocked Malekith's lack of strength, telling him he expected more, before then knocking him back with a powerful hit from Mjølnir.

Thor uses Mjølnir to attack Malekith
The Asgardian and the Dark Elf began to fight as Thor attempted to use the power of Mjølnir to destroy his foe, only to discover that the Aether had given Malekith incredible strength and durability, allowing him to absorb blows from the hammer and fire them back. The Battle caused them to be pushed through all the Convergence's portals, although throughout the battle they're both equally matched strength meant neither could kill the other while they fought.

Thor loses Mjølnir while on Svartalfheim
The Dark Elves began to invade Greenwich but Erik Selvig's devices teleported some of them away, stopping the Dark Elves' army from defeating the humans and allowing Malekith to ensure his own plans to take control of the Nine Realms come true. As they had continued fighting, Thor and Malekith crash landed in Svartalfheim where Thor attempted to Mjølnir at Malekith, only to then lose it through a portal, leaving him near defenseless from Malekith's attacks.
