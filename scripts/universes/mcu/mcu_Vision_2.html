<html><p>Avengers Tower: Following the Battle of Seoul, the Avengers managed to retrieve the Regeneration Cradle with the android body created by Helen Cho. Examining the Cradle at the Avengers Tower, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner decided to design the new A.I. in the body, using the logical matrix of J.A.R.V.I.S. As Captain America, Quicksilver, and Wanda Maximoff attempted to stop them, Thor provided the Cradle electrical power in order to awaken Vision. Newly-created Vision joined the Avengers in order to defeat Ultron.

New Avengers Facility: Upon the defeat of Ultron, Vision joined reformed Avengers in the compound in New York where he lived. Vision was tasked by Tony Stark to watch over Wanda Maximoff, upon the ratification of the Sokovia Accords. However, Vision was attacked by Hawkeye and then defeated by Maximoff before they escaped from the facility. Later, Vision, wounded by Corvus Glaive, was brought to the facility before they traveled to Wakanda.

Trivia
In the comics, Vision was believed to have been created using the remains of the original Human Torch, though it was ultimately revealed to be a duplicate. He later married Scarlet Witch and had two sons, who were ultimately erased from existence, but were reincarnated as Wiccan and Speed. He also gave himself the name Victor Shade, when he felt depressed that he did not have a human name.
Vision has Van Gogh's The Mulberry Tree in his room at the New Avengers Facility.
The Russo Brothers revealed on Twitter that it was Vision who dumped the coffee grounds in the disposal Stark complained about in Captain America: Civil War.
Following the Clash of the Avengers, Vision is seen with a chessboard. He is holding a rook, the only chess piece to not be a person, similar to how he is not an actual person.
Vision being reactivated in a pure white body seen in the mid-credits scene of WandaVision episode Previously On is in reference to the comics, where Vision had a white form upon being resurrected.
Behind the Scenes
Some of Spider-Man: Homecoming concept arts featured Vision and War Machine taking part at the rescue of the Staten Island Ferry alongside Iron Man, a concept that did not make it to the final version of the movie.
Jan Petrina, Richard Cetrone, Josh Wood, Adam Lytle and Eric Mbanda were stunt doubles for Paul Bettany in the role of Vision.
John Zimmerman was a stand-in for Paul Bettany in the role of Vision.
Anthony Russo described Vision's role in Avengers: Infinity War as "a living MacGuffin. Obviously, that raises the stakes because Vision's life is in danger, and his life is in conflict with Thanos' goals, so something’s got to give."
Paul Bettany revealed in an interview while promoting WandaVision that Joss Whedon originally intended for Vision to have a penis, despite misgivings from Kevin Feige and Louis D'Esposito. Upon seeing the concept art, Whedon concluded that it was a bad idea.
