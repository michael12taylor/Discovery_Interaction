Nebula is a former Luphomoid assassin, an adopted daughter of the intergalactic warlord Thanos and adopted sister of Gamora. As the right-hand woman of Ronan the Accuser during his and Thanos' quest to retrieve the Orb, she helped him fight the Guardians of the Galaxy during the Battle of Xandar. Fleeing the battle after a fight with Gamora, Nebula was soon captured by the Sovereign and handed back to the Guardians after a finished commission. She escaped and helped Taserface lead the other Ravagers in a mutiny against their former leader Yondu Udonta before leaving to find and kill Gamora. After forgiving and helping her sister alongside the Guardians during the Battle on Ego's Planet, she left in a ship to pursue a revenge mission against Thanos.

Nebula was eventually captured by Thanos, however, and used as a bargaining tool to convince Gamora to reveal the location of the Soul Stone. Escaping and then pursuing Thanos to Titan, Nebula learned that Thanos had killed Gamora and aided both the Guardians, Doctor Strange, Iron Man, and Spider-Man during the Battle of Titan. Despite their efforts, they failed to stop Thanos from obtaining the Infinity Stones, which he then used to wipe out half the universe's population. Nebula was among those who survived but was left alone in space while departing from Titan to Earth with Stark in Benatar until they are found by Captain Marvel, who brought the pair to the New Avengers Facility in New York.

Now on Earth, Nebula joined the Avengers, participating on the Ambush on Thanos. Following Thanos' murder at the hands of Thor, she spent the next five years traveling throughout the world with Rocket Raccoon under Natasha Romanoff's command. In 2023, she joined her fellow Avengers in the Time Heist, traveling to Morag in 2014 with War Machine to retrieve the Power Stone, creating an alternate timeline in the process. However, she was kidnapped and replaced by her alternate past self, who took her place and returned to the future. Teaming up with the Gamora from alternate 2014, Nebula killed her past self and participated in the Battle of Earth. In the aftermath of Stark's sacrifice during the battle to use the Infinity Stones to eliminate Thanos and those loyal to him, Nebula attended his funeral to honor him. Nebula, along with Thor and Rocket, left the Avengers and rejoined the Guardians of the Galaxy once again.

Biography
Early Life
Trained for Thanos
As an infant, Thanos invaded Nebula's home planet, murdering her whole family yet taking her to train her as a merciless warrior devoted to his service. While Nebula greatly despised her other adopted siblings, she formed a genuine bond with Gamora to the point that they began to truly consider each other as sisters. Throughout her childhood, Nebula trained to be a Galaxy-class killer under the tutelage of Ronan the Accuser. Nebula would often train alongside Gamora and Korath.

Thanos regularly had Nebula spar with Gamora to test their strengths with Gamora winning every match. Every time Nebula lost, Thanos would upgrade her to try and make her Gamora's equal. Nebula grew to resent Gamora for never letting her win causing Thanos to torture her.

One training scenario on the arboreal world of Dervani saw Nebula and Gamora pitted against each other in a competition to retrieve a data ingot for Ronan. The girls sparred on the surface, leading to Gamora throwing Nebula off a cliff, severely injuring her and requiring multiple cybernetic replacements in order for her to live. Upon reaching adulthood, Nebula and Gamora served Thanos under the command of Korath.

On a mission to locate the Orb on Praxius IX, inside of one of the Cloud Tombs of Praxius, Nebula went in without waiting for Gamora and fell into a trap. Ensnared by an impenetrable Laser Thorn Energy Net, Nebula found herself at the mercy of the inhabitants and needed to be rescued by Gamora. Never one to tolerate failure, Thanos ordered Gamora to leave Nebula behind, with only a sharp blade to free herself. Nebula was forced to amputate her own arm in order to escape the netting.

Quest for the Orb
Family Conquests
Nebula during the massacre of Korbin
Under Thanos' orders, Nebula and Gamora participated in the cleansing of half of the Korbinites. During the skirmish, she managed to kill a few soldiers. However, she is attacked by a enemy soldier who threw a stray grenade in her direction, causing her to fall. Fortunately, Nebula was saved at the last minute by Gamora, who killed the enemy soldier. Extending a helping hand, Nebula scoffed at claimed not to have needed help, only for Gamora to remind her that she always needed her help.

Nebula learns Thanos found the Power Stone
The two daughters of Thanos then regrouped back on the Q-Ship after their mission was completed. Gamora learned about Thanos' success in locating the Power Stone on Morag and shared that information with Nebula, who then began to stress to Gamora that their adopted father would finally put his plan into effect to hunt for the Infinity Stones. However, Gamora assured Nebula that Thanos only found one of the stones at the moment and is yet to uncover the others.

Gamora and Nebula getting orders by Thanos
As Nebula continued to fret over Thanos' plan, Thanos suddenly appeared on their Q-Ship as he wiped off the blood from his double-edged sword. As he approached his daughters, Thanos informed the two that his ally in the Kree Empire, Ronan the Accuser, had located the Orb and was therefore planning to dispatch his two daughters to Ronan's Kree ship — the Dark Aster — to oversee the retrieval of the Power Stone for him and deliver it to him.

Nebula displaying her loyalty towards Thanos
Gamora, however, pointed out that Ronan would be displeased with them being at his side during his search for the Power Stone. Thanos then warned the two that Ronan's alternate was death if they refused, noting that his obsession with the Kree-Nova War clouded his judgments. Nebula then bowed down to Thanos and promised to not fail him, to which Thanos responded that she won't fail him.

Following Ronan's Orders
Nebula witnesses Ronan executing a Nova Corps member
Nebula and Gamora left the Q-Ship and were dispatched to the Dark Aster, belonging to Ronan the Accuser, who made a deal to retrieve the Orb for Thanos so he would, in turn, destroy Xandar. As Korath the Pursuer returned to the Dark Aster, having returned from Morag, Nebula updated Ronan that he arrived back after which he concluded with the ritualistic execution of a Nova Corps officer sent to negotiate the peace deal.

Nebula on Dark Aster with Ronan the Accuser
Nebula, Gamora, and Ronan then listened to Korath as he reported that he had failed to retrieve the Orb on Morag, thanks to Star-Lord's intervention, but informed the trio that, through his various sources, he believed that the Ravager would be selling the Orb to the Broker on Xandar. Ronan, ranting on how badly he wanted to destroy Xandar and wipe out all the Nova Corps as an act of vengeance for what the transgressions they committed against the Kree Empire and being responsible for the deaths of his family, tasked Nebula to retrieve the Orb from Star-Lord on Xandar and bring it to him on the Dark Aster once she recovered it.

Nebula's reaction upon Gamora being sent to retrieve the Orb
As Nebula told him it would be an honor, Gamora resisted, reminding Ronan that he would have to stand in front of Thanos and report his failure if the Orb wasn't brought to him. Nebula, slightly offended by Gamora's statement, arrogantly claimed to be the daughter of Thanos just as Gamora.  However, Ronan, considering Gamora's warning, instead sent Gamora to Xandar, threatening her with a severe punishment if she failed, despite the fact that she had never failed Thanos.

Nebula confronting and threatening Gamora
When they left the meeting, Nebula confronted Gamora and they had a brief argument where they tried to break each other's fingers. Nebula accused her sister of now attempting to become Ronan's favorite and they argued over who was the superior killer. When Nebula mentioned that the screams of her victims could be heard across the galaxy, Gamora replied that it was because she took too long to kill them before walking away from Nebula.

Meeting With Thanos
Nebula and Ronan are contacted by The Other
Ultimately, Nebula and Ronan realized through their sources that Gamora had been captured by the Nova Corps after her skirmish with Star-Lord on Xandar and was imprisoned at the Kyln as punishment. However, through communication with The Other, the two learned that she had betrayed him and instead planned to sell the Orb to a third party. The Other then demanded the two travel to the Sanctuary and discuss the issue with Thanos in person as Ronan's alliance with the Mad Titan was at risk.

Nebula attending their meeting with Thanos
On the Sanctuary, Nebula repaired her cybernetic arm while Ronan argued with The Other, berating him and Thanos for claiming that she betrayed their cause, reminding the two that she lost the battle against Star-Lord on Xandar, despite being a deadly assassin. Nebula then witnessed as Ronan snapped The Other's neck, and she heard Ronan asking Thanos to understand the severity of the situation at hand. Thanos, unfazed by his servant's death, responded by threatening Ronan's life if he failed again.

Nebula and Ronan leave the Sanctuary
Thanos then claimed that Ronan's obsession with the Kree-Nova War bored him, and heard him call Gamora his "favorite daughter," which irked her. Thanos promised to honor their agreement and supply Ronan with a formidable army, but threatened to "bathe the starwars in his blood" if he failed again. As they left, Nebula thanked Thanos for the meeting and assured Ronan that he would lose a fight with her father, and insisted on heading to the Kyln so they could collect the Orb.

Cleansing the Kyln
Nebula brutally torturing all the Kyln's guards
After Ronan and Nebula left the Sanctuary, they followed The Other's lead and arrived at the Kyln, only to discover that Gamora, Star-Lord, and three other individuals had escaped from the prison with the Orb in their possession. As a result, the Sakaarans took over the prison and interrogated the hostages in an attempt to gain information on Gamora's next destination. On the second floor, Nebula tortured a Nova Guard to gather more information.

Nebula is ordered by Ronan to "cleanse" the Kyln
However, she suddenly received a message on her cybernetics that the Nova Corps were on their way to defend the prison. As they were leaving Ronan ordered Nebula to send their Necrocraft across the galaxy to search for Gamora through any necessary means. Nebula then asked him what to do with the prisoners, to which he responded to cleanse the prison of all the guards and prisoners in an attempt to prevent the Nova Corps from realizing what they were after.

Skirmish on Knowhere
Nebula arrives on Knowhere with Ronan
Following the orders of Ronan the Accuser, Nebula and Korath continued their search for the Orb across the galaxy onboard the Dark Aster, until they received a message from Drax the Destroyer telling them it was on Knowhere where they went to recover it. Upon arriving onboard Necrocraft and their army of Sakaarans, they were spotted by Gamora and her new team, who escaped into a mining pod while Nebula gave chase with her small army.

Nebula is ordered to retrieve the Orb
While Ronan decided to stay behind on Knowhere and fight Drax, whose wife and daughter had been killed by the Kree under Thanos's orders, Nebula was ordered by Ronan to retrieve the Orb from Gamora. Following his orders, Nebula lead a squad of soldiers in fighter ships to chase Gamora across Knowhere. After having identified the correct ship that was piloted by Gamora, she seized it, and ordered the Sakaarans to shoot it down.

Nebula chases Gamora
Ultimately, Nebula chased Gamora throughout the mining colony, while Rocket Raccoon and Star Lord managed to destroy several Necrocrafts. Ultimately, Nebula managed to overwhelm Gamora, who decided to go out into deep space in an attempt to evade Nebula and Ronan's forces. However, Nebula and the Sakaarans continued to pursue her, shooting in her direction, and ultimately they managed to corner her ship. Ultimately, Nebula managed to corner Gamora's space pod, and expressed her bitter sentiment at her, claiming that out of all of their siblings in the Black Order, she hated her the least.

Nebula destroys Gamora's mining pod
Gamora pleaded Nebula to reconsider her alliance with Ronan, warning her that he would kill everyone if he obtained the Power Stone, only for Nebula to declare that she would already be dead, before destroying her ship. Leaving Gamora for dead in space, who was eventually rescued by Star-Lord and the Ravagers, Nebula retrieved the Orb and traveled back to Knowhere to update Ronan on her successes as he reigned victorious in his fight against Drax.

Betraying Thanos
Nebula and Korath see Ronan betray Thanos
After the Skirmish on Knowhere, Nebula returned to the Dark Aster and presented Ronan with the Orb. Both her and Korath the Pursuer were present when Ronan contacted Thanos and updated the Mad Titan on his success on Knowhere. When Thanos told Ronan to bring the Orb to him, Ronan ignored his demands and instead informed Thanos that he was aware that the Orb contained one of the six Infinity Stones, which shocked both Korath and Nebula.

Nebula witnesses Ronan opening up the Orb
To Thanos' horror, Ronan ripped the Orb open to reveal the Power Stone, which he observed while Korath warned him that he should not double-cross Thanos as he was the most powerful being in the universe. Ronan assured him that with the Power Stone, he was more powerful than the Mad Titan. Ronan then proceeded to harness the stone's power and attached it to his Cosmi-Rod, as he was strong enough to wield its power.

Nebula vowing her loyalty towards Ronan
Ronan then announced that he would destroy Xandar with the Power Stone, ending the existence of the Nova Corps and the status of the Kree-Nova War before personally threatening to kill Thanos shortly after. When the Mad Titan ended the transmission, Nebula, satisfied with his promise to kill Thanos, offered her total loyalty to Ronan should he succeed, swearing to help him destroy a thousand planets.

Battle of Xandar
Nebula witnesses the Ravagers attack
As the Dark Aster approached the atmosphere of Xandar, a fleet of Ravagers lead by Yondu Udonta and Star-Lord engaged them. Nebula then warned Ronan of their presence. The fleet fired a blot of flame to disguise their moves, but Nebula saw that they had dived under the ship and she ordered all their fighters to destroy the ships. 

Nebula receives orders from Ronan
Once they received word that the side of the ship had been breached, Nebula tried to convince Ronan the Accuser to retaliate but he refused, stating that his focus was to land on the planet's surface so he could finally destroy it. Nebula considered Ronan's plans and ordered the Sakaarans to seal the security doors so the Guardians of the Galaxy could not reach Ronan. Deciding to take matters into her own hands, Nebula took a squad of soldiers with her to engage the attackers before shutting the door, locking in Ronan. 

Nebula challenges all of the Guardians
While the Sakaarans protected the ship, Nebula decided to confront the Guardians of the Galaxy herself. When Star-Lord, Gamora, Rocket Raccoon and Drax breached the ship, Nebula confronted them. As Nebula began to insult her former sister, she was silenced when Drax shot her with a rocket, sending her flying backward and damaging her body while allowing the Guardians to continue on their mission.

Duel against Gamora
Nebula prepares to fight against Gamora
The shot fired by Drax the Destroyer caused Nebula's entire body to be damaged, but her cybernetic implants helped to repair her within moments, twisting her arm and jaw back into place. Once she was repaired Nebula began to fight Gamora, using her electrified batons against Gamora's Godslayer. During their fight against each other, the side of the ship was suddenly torn apart by an explosion as the Battle of Xandar between the Yondu Ravager Clan and the Sakaarans continued on.

Nebula nearly kills Gamora
During their fight, Gamora attempted to unlock an armored door to assist the Guardians of the Galaxy, however, Nebula did all she could to delay this action. Eventually, Nebula managed to gain the upper hand by disarming Gamora and then using her batons to electrocute Gamora, nearly killing her. However, Gamora regained her strength and knocked her outside of the hole in the Dark Aster and leaving Nebula hanging onto the edge of the hole.

Nebula escapes from the Dark Aster
As Nebula hung hundreds of feet above Xandar's surface, with her hand trapped onto a spike, Gamora tried to convince her to fight against Ronan the Accuser, claiming Ronan was crazy. But Nebula refused, citing they were both crazy and cut off her cybernetic hand. However, instead of falling from the sky to her death, she landed on top of a Ravager's M-Ship. Nebula then threw the pilot out and took control of the ship before flying it far away from the battle.

Finding Acceptance
Captured by the Sovereign
Nebula is given to Gamora
Sometime later, Nebula was arrested by Ayesha and the Sovereign for trying to steal expensive Anulax Batteries. Two months after the Battle of Xandar, the Guardians of the Galaxy were present at the palace and were given custody of Nebula as a reward for killing the Abilisk during the Battle of on Sovereign, thus ending its reign of terror on the Sovereign people.

The Sovereign hand Nebula over to Gamora
As Nebula was brought before Ayesha and the Guardians and unmasked, she exchanged a threatening stare with Gamora, who just looked at her calmly. When Ayesha claimed to have known that she is her sister, Gamora claimed that Nebula was worth nothing to her and was only taking custody of her to hand her over to the Nova Corps on Xandar to receive their bounty. Before leaving, Ayesha questioned Quill about his ancestry and hinted that his father was of a unique species, thus prompting him to wonder who his father really was.

Escape from the Sovereign Fleet
Nebula threatens to kill Gamora
While still locked up Nebula continued to mock Gamora for joining the Guardians before demanding that she be fed some fruit, which Gamora refused to give her, claiming the fruit was still not ripe enough. As Gamora claimed to hate her, Nebula reminded her that she betrayed Ronan the Accuser and was deemed a hero by the Nova Corps for saving Xandar. She then threatens to kill her and exact revenge upon her.

Nebula is locked up on board the Milano
However, as Gamora arrogantly claimed that she would spend the rest of her life in a Xandarian prison for her war crimes she committed in her upbringing and alliance with Ronan during the Quest for the Orb wishing she had the opportunity to kill her, the Guardians noticed that they were being pursued by the Sovereign fleet because Rocket Raccoon covertly stole their batteries prior to their departure from Sovereign and farewell to Ayesha. While the Guardians attempted to flee from the Sovereign by accessing a jump point, the Sovereign ships continued to shoot at the Milano, damaging some of its parts.

Nebula calls the Guardians of the Galaxy idiots
During the pursuit, Nebula was almost sucked out of the ship, but escaped her restraints. As the Guardians of the Galaxy berated Rocket for his foolish actions, Nebula called the Guardians a bunch of "idiots" after having nearly been sucked into space. With the Guardians having successfully passed through the jump point, Nebula's hands remained handcuffed and she demanded to be released after they crashed on Berhert, with the six of them barely surviving, despite the destruction of the Milano.

Meeting Ego
Nebula witnesses Ego's surprising arrival
After having crashed on Berhert, the Guardians of the Galaxy managed to reunite with each other on and Nebula was pulled out of the destroyed Milano. As the Guardians blamed Rocket Raccoon for his foolish actions on Sovereign, Nebula warned the Guardians that an unidentified spacecraft was approaching them from space, before convincing Gamora to liberate her of her restraints as she could help fight them. However, Gamora refused, claiming that she knew Nebula would try to kill her. Moments later, the space ship landed before the Guardians, and Ego and Mantis stepped out, introducing themselves to the Guardians.

Nebula has dinner with the Guardians of the Galaxy and Ego
Nebula witnessed Ego's revelation that he was Star-Lord's father. That night, Ego and Mantis had dinner with the Guardians. The next day she was left in the Milano with Rocket Raccoon and Groot whilst Gamora, Quill and Drax the Destroyer went with Ego and Mantis. Before Gamora left with the others to Ego's planet, Nebula asked if she was being left with Rocket Raccoon, mistaking his species for a fox, to which Gamora responded that he was not a fox. Gamora then gave Rocket an official order to shoot her if she attempts to escape or if he simply feels like it.

Attack on Berhert
Nebula convinces Groot to free her
After Star-Lord, Gamora, and Drax left Berhert and accompanied Mantis and Ego to his living planet, Rocket was ambushed by the Ravagers led by Yondu Udonta, having been dispatched by Ayesha to capture the Guardians of the Galaxy. Nebula, overhearing the commotion and witnessing the situation, managed to trick Groot into freeing her so that she could seemingly rescue him from the Ravagers.

Nebula prepares to shoot Rocket Raccoon
Groot, unaware of her sinister intentions, released her from her restraints. As an uprising began amongst Yondu Udonta's clan after which he revealed his intentions of double crossing Ayesha and taking the Anulax Batteries himself, she managed to persuade Groot to release her before intervening. The fight got to a point where Yondu summoned his Yaka Arrow on all his Ravagers as they were threatening to depose him. 

Nebula takes a bit out of an yaro root
While Rocket tried to pacify the situation, Nebula came from behind and shot Yondu's fin before he could kill anyone who opposed his rule, thus rendering him unconscious before proceeding to shoot Rocket in the chest with the Electric Blaster. The Ravagers looked from Nebula's direction in shock as she announced herself that she was their new leader, and she began to take a bite out of a yaro root before spitting it out and claiming it was not ripe.

Ravager Mutiny
Nebula witnesses the Ravager mutiny
She was taken aboard Yondu's ship witnessing the mutiny led by Taserface, in which he executed associates of Yondu Udonta who opposed Taserface's new rule and still declared their allegiance to Yondu. As a vexed Taserface prepared to execute Rocket Raccoon who was mocking his name, Nebula announced that there would be no more killings that day, having been fed up with the mutiny. When Taserface questioned her if she was the deadliest woman of the galaxy, Nebula responded that she was under Thanos' tutelage, but Gamora stole that mantle from her time after time after defeating her in combat.

Nebula makes a new deal with Taserface
She then demanded ten percent of the bounty Ayesha had placed on the Guardians of the Galaxy as well as 'some other things'. Nebula was given a new cybernetic hand by Kraglin Obfonteri as well as an M-Ship. When asked what she would do with the bounty, she informed him of her upbringing with Thanos and how he had 'upgraded' her every time she lost a sparring match to Gamora. Nebula explained that after she kills Gamora she would use her ten percent to buy every ship she could to kill Thanos. A bewildered Kraglin wished her luck before Nebula left the Eclector and traveled to Ego's Planet so she could finally kill Gamora.

Fight with Gamora
Nebula attacks Gamora in a M-Ship
Nebula flew to Ego the Living Planet and began firing at Gamora, who was meditating in a flower field. Gamora fled from Nebula, hiding in one of the caverns. However, Nebula redirected her course, pursuing her into caverns, causing the ship to be destroyed. Nebula became trapped in the M-Ship as Gamora started shooting at the ship. Sensing that the ship was about to explode, Gamora rescued Nebula before the entire ship erupted into flames, which sent them to the ground.

Nebula finally beats Gamora in combat
Both sisters, injured, got up and Nebula immediately attacked her. A shocked Gamora then continued to fight her until Nebula finally got her into a choke hold. Instead of finishing her sister off, Nebula let her go and finally expressed excitement at the fact that she finally bested her in combat, only for Gamora to claim that she saved her life and that the match was unfair, and, therefore, she did not truly win the match.

Nebula and Gamora discover a cavern of skulls
Nebula, claiming that she just wanted a sister, expressed her anger at Gamora for always beating her in combat, which resulted in Thanos 'upgrading' her every time she lost. The pair formed an uneasy alliance, and explored their surroundings in the caverns. As they walked through the caverns, they discovered a large pile of bones, seemingly confirming that Ego had sinister intentions. Observing the chamber, Nebula claimed that they had to get off the planet before Ego killed all of the Guardians of the Galaxy.

Battle on Ego's Planet
Nebula mocks the Guardians of the Galaxy
Nebula and Gamora rushed back to the palace and confronted Mantis who agreed to help them. Along with Drax the Destroyer, they burst into the main hall to find Ego attacking Star-Lord before a ship piloted by Yondu Udonta and Rocket Raccoon crushed him. Nebula agreed to help as the Guardians were her only ride off of Ego.

Nebula and the Guardians of the Galaxy prepare to rescue Peter Quill
During the Battle on Ego's Planet, she wired the ship up to her cybernetic arm to provide power to the lasers which electrocuted her and caused her great pain but destroyed the Sovereign fleet in the process, which pursued the Guardians on Ego's Planet with the final intent on killing all of them for stealing the Anulax Batteries shortly after the Battle on Sovereign. When the ship was destroyed she joined the Guardians of the Galaxy in the heart of the planet to continue the fight Quill's sadistic father and prevent him from killing all of them.

Nebula helps the Guardians defeat Ego
When Ego attacked, Nebula saved Gamora from falling to her death with the sisters climbing back up to the fight before being trapped and suffocated in organic matter. When Star-Lord took control, they were both released, which allowed them to reach the ship piloted by Kraglin Obfonteri. However, Gamora, upon asking Rocket Raccoon where Quill was, ultimately realized from Groot that Quill had decided to stay on the planet to allow the Guardians to leave. Before Gamora could react, Rocket shot her unconscious, unwilling to lose another friend.

Nebula helps the Guardians of the Galaxy kill Ego
However, Star-Lord reigned victorious over Ego and the Guardians set off the explosion in Ego's brain, thus killing him. At the last moment, Nebula witnessed as Yondu Udonta decided to sacrifice his life for the life of Peter's. The two embraced each other, with Yondu lamenting that he had always been his true father as he raised him to be a Ravager and treated him as an equal. Star-Lord returned to the ship, and he, Nebula, and the others mournfully watched as Yondu suffocated and died in space.

Reconciling with Gamora
Nebula is hugged by Gamora before leaving
Nebula prepared to leave during Yondu Udonta's funeral. Despite Gamora's attempts to persuade her into joining them, she chose to leave and try to kill Thanos instead and prevent other people's daughters from sharing the same fate she has suffered. The two sisters reconciled and hugged before Nebula departed.

Infinity War
Futile Vengeance
Nebula being brutally tortured by Thanos
In the years following the battle with Ego, Nebula attempted to kill Thanos by sneaking onto the Sanctuary II. She nearly succeeded, but was caught by her former master and put in a torture chamber, where her cybernetic parts were pulled apart from her body, causing immense pain. When Thanos captured Gamora after she attempted to stop him on Knowhere, he brought her to Nebula to force her to reveal the location of the Soul Stone.

Nebula is tortured more by Thanos
Thanos began torturing Nebula again, tearing the cybernetic parts from her body using the Infinity Gauntlet, in an attempt to get the information from Gamora. Gamora at first resisted, claiming she didn't know the location of the Soul Stone. Thanos, who knew that Gamora was lying, stated that he made her a strong assassin, but never taught her to lie, and he played a clip from Nebula's memory using a projector in her cybernetic parts.

Nebula kills one of Thanos' Chitauri henchmen
The clip showed Gamora having a conversation with Nebula, in which Gamora stated that she found the map to the Soul Stone, but decided to burn it to ash to prevent Thanos from finding it. After commenting on how poor of a liar Gamora was, Thanos started ruthlessly torturing Nebula again, until Gamora gave in and told Thanos the location of the Soul Stone: Vormir. The two then departed to Vormir to retrieve the Soul Stone.

Nebula gives the coordinates to Mantis
When Thanos and Gamora left, one of his Chitauri henchmen began putting Nebula back together. Seizing a quick opportunity, she killed the henchman and made a quick escape from her captivity. Nebula contacted Mantis, requesting her and the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy to meet her on Titan, knowing that the members of Thanos' Black Order would meet him there once they found the Time Stone and Mind Stone. Getting inside a Necrocraft, she flew to Titan with the desire to enact her plan to kill Thanos.

Battle of Titan
Nebula fighting against Thanos on Titan
When she arrived on Titan, the Guardians of the Galaxy were fighting alongside Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Doctor Strange in a battle with Thanos. Nebula crashed the Necrocraft into Thanos, then exited the spacecraft and attacked him with an electrified staff. She told him that he should have killed her, to which Thanos angrily remarked that it would have been a waste of parts. As she continued to fight him, Nebula demanded to know where Gamora was.

Nebula yelling at Thanos
Although she fought ferociously, Nebula would prove to be no match for Thanos and was quickly thrown back into a pile of rocks. Eventually, the Guardians and Avengers then restrained Thanos, with Mantis successfully putting him into a passive state. Star-Lord then asked Thanos where Gamora was. Nebula got up and approached her restrained father whose thoughts and consciousness was pacified by Mantis.

Nebula realizing what happened to Gamora
As Star-Lord inquired about Gamora's whereabouts, Thanos began to weep in front of a shocked Nebula, who deduced that Gamora had not returned with Thanos from their trip to Vormir upon obtaining the Soul Stone. Nebula informed this to Star-Lord, and Thanos confirmed that it was true by muttering that he had to kill her. Stricken with grief, Star-Lord began to attack Thanos' face with his blaster in a state of blind fury, weakening Mantis' grip.

Nebula tells Peter Quill what had happened to Gamora
Despite Iron Man's attempts to hold Star-Lord back, it was too late; Thanos was able to break free, and he overpowered the Avengers and the Guardians due to Star-Lord's attack. He regained control and after escaping, Thanos removed the souls of Drax, Star-Lord, and Nebula with a burst of energy from the Soul Stone. Thanos then pulled chunks of Titan's moon down from orbit, causing a meteor shower to engulf the planet. Nebula, Drax and Star-Lord all began to lifelessly float in the air due to Titan's fluctuating gravity and the intense impact from the meteors.

Nebula was saved by Spider-Man, who had also saved Star-Lord, Drax the Destroyer, and Mantis restored their souls to their bodies. After successfully besting Iron Man and Doctor Strange, Strange gave Thanos the Time Stone so that he would spare Stark's life, saying that the Avengers were now in the endgame. As Star-Lord ambushed the Mad Titan and began shooting a him, Thanos then left Titan in pursuit of the final Infinity Stone, the Mind Stone, on Earth.

Thanos' Victory
Nebula realizes Thanos' plan has succeeded
While he was on the Earth, Thanos had successfully obtained the Mind Stone during the Battle of Wakanda and, using the full Infinity Gauntlet, snapped his fingers, wiping out half of all sentient life in the universe. Nebula, having survived the Snap, grimly watched as the Guardians of the Galaxy as well as Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man had all perished and faded into ash as a result of Thanos' victory.

Nebula mourning the death of her sister
Nebula told Tony Stark that Thanos had succeeded in his mission, with visible despair on her face. She then sat on the ground as she grieved Gamora's death and Thanos' victory along with Iron Man, who sat in despair at the fact that half of the universe was killed by the Snap and he could do nothing about it. With her own ship damaged, she joined Stark in commandeering the Benatar in order to leave Titan.

Aftermath
Trapped in Space
Nebula playing a game with Tony Stark
The fuel cells of the Benatar had been damaged during the Battle of Titan, forcing Tony Stark and Nebula to work together to repair it. After succeeding in repairing the ship, Stark set a course for Earth. However, the ship only possessed forty-eight hours worth of fuel left, leaving the pair stranded in deep space with no help. Over the course of twenty-four days, they bonded and developed a friendly relationship, rationing their food, and water and playing games to pass the time.  

Nebula offers Tony Stark some food rations
Nebula continued to provide medical assistance to Stark due to the stab wound he had received from Thanos during the Battle of Titan. Nearly a month later, their supply of oxygen began to run out and Nebula and Stark were aware that they most likely were going to die. Before, Tony sent a final transmission to Pepper Potts. Luckily, Captain Marvel showed up in front of Benatar, and she single-handily moved the stranded ship to Earth.

Nebula being comforted by Rocket Raccoon
Landing at the New Avengers Facility, Nebula reunited with Rocket Raccoon and the other Avengers, while Tony and Steve awkwardly encountered each other, with both claiming that they were defeated by Thanos during Infinity War. A disheartened Rocket asked about the status of the other Guardians of the Galaxy, only for her to solemnly look down, thus confirming to the surviving Guardian that the others perished during the Snap along with half of the universe.

Locating Thanos
Nebula discusses where to locate Thanos
Nebula and the Avengers regrouped in the meeting room where Natasha Romanoff went over the list of casualties of the Snap to both Tony Stark and Nebula which included T'Challa, Sharon Carter, Shuri, Erik Selvig, Sam Wilson, Bucky Barnes, Stephen Strange, Wanda Maximoff, and others. Steve Rogers then attempted to gain information on Thanos' current whereabouts by interrogating Tony, who had fought him on Titan. Instead, Stark and Rogers started to fight due to unresolved issues stemming from the Avengers Civil War.

Nebula and War Machine travel to the Garden
With Tony rehabilitating and resting in another room, the Avengers started to discuss Thanos' possible location. Nebula revealed Thanos' location — the Garden — as she elaborated upon Thanos fixing her in her youth to make her equally formidable as Gamora was. Nebula then joined the Avengers as they traveled to the Garden so they could use the Infinity Stones to resurrect every victim of the Snap. While they traveled, Rocket sarcastically told them not to throw up on his ship.

Ambush on Thanos
Nebula learning Thanos destroyed the Stones
Nebula then joined the Avengers as they traveled to Garden on the Benatar. During the trip, Rocket sarcastically instructed the Avengers not to throw up on his ship as none of them, except for Nebula, had been to space before. When they arrived to the Garden, Captain Marvel was dispatched to scout the entirety of the planet. After which she concluded that Thanos was alone in exile, the Avengers headed to Thanos' resting place, restrained him, and cut off his arm with the Infinity Gauntlet.

Thanos' blood splatters over Nebula's head
Rocket Raccoon, who Nebula developed a bond with both having lost the little family they had managed to gain, then kicked Thanos' detached limb to discover that the stones are gone. Thanos explained that he actually destroyed the Stones prior to their arrival to ensure that the Snap remains permanent, mentioning that it had almost killed him when doing so. Many of the Avengers were skeptical of this, but Nebula said that while Thanos was many things, a liar wasn't one of them.

Nebula closes Thanos' eyelids out of respect
Thanos confirms this by thanking Nebula for pointing that out and admitting that he was wrong to be too harsh on her. This enraged Thor who cut Thanos' head off in retaliation, which made some of the Titan's blood splatter on Nebula's face. Despite her hatred towards Thanos, Nebula was touched by his last words and mourned for him by closing his eyelids out of respect. She and the other Avengers were forced to accept the losses for the rest of their lives.

Helping the Avengers

In the five years after the Snap, Nebula continued to protect the universe as she served as an Avenger under Natasha Romanoff's command, helping maintain peace across the universe to help those who lost people to the Snap. She also changed her left superficial armor plating with bronze colored ones. Nebula returns to space with Rocket Raccoon using the Benatar and inspects a ship suspected of selling weapons, only for it to be a garbage scow.

Nebula listening to Okoye's latest update
During a holo-conference, she voices her frustration at Captain Marvel for sending them into such a situation. At the conference's end, she and Rocket return to patrol.

Discussing the Infinity Stones
Nebula warns War Machine about Scott Lang
Following Scott Lang's return from the Quantum Realm and proposed the idea of the "Time Heist" to undo Thanos' actions, she and Rocket Raccoon returned to Earth following a summons from Romanoff. Arriving at the New Avengers Facility, she came across Lang eating a taco, and as he claimed that Nebula looked awesome, she sarcastically transmitted a message on her earpiece to James Rhodes, advising him to be careful entering the landing zone, calling Lang an "idiot"  before regrouping with the Avengers in a debriefing room.

Nebula listens to Thor talk about the Aether
The Avengers discussed the history of the Infinity Stones. As such, they learned from Thor that the Aether was originally owned by the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim, but it was taken away by the Asgardians, who hid it in a secret chamber until Thor's ex-girlfriend Jane Foster uncovered it and became its next host. Through Rocket Raccoon, the Avengers also learned that the Power Stone was stolen by Peter Quill on Morag.

Nebula explains the Soul Stone's location
When Romanoff asked about the Soul Stone, Nebula solemnly stated that it was located on an isolated planet called Vormir, and she also proceeded to inform them that Vormir was the location from which Thanos murdered Gamora. As they tested the Advanced Tech Suit, Nebula adjusted the inner functions for Clint Barton while Bruce Banner educated Rhodes and Lang about time travel mechanics. Following a successful time jump, she along with the Avengers gear up with their suits, and aim for their targets, the Infinity Stones in the past.

Nebula preparing herself to travel through time
After reexamining the information about the Infinity Stones across their respective encounters, Banner, Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, and Natasha Romanoff managed to narrow down three periods where each stone are aligned with three small teams: 2012 with the Mind, Space, and Time Stones at Stark Tower and the New York Sanctum; 2013 with the Reality Stone occupying Jane Foster on Asgard; 2014 with the Power Stone on Morag and the Soul Stone on Vormir.

Time Heist
Arriving on Morag
Nebula and War Machine arriving on Morag
When the teams are assigned, Nebula teams up with War Machine, Black Widow, and Hawkeye to collect the Power and Soul Stone in 2014, creating an alternate timeline in the process. The four arrived on Morag hours before Peter Quill would have showed up to steal the Orb on Morag and would have been confronted by Korath the Pursuer. After enlarging the Benatar and the space pod, Nebula and War Machine were hurried by Romanoff and Barton who reminded them that they needed to speed it up.

Nebula and War Machine prepare to team up
War Machine jokingly claimed that all of their complaints were not helpful to their mission. The four then proceeded to hug and they wished each other luck in obtaining the Power and Soul Stones before Romanoff and Barton departed for Vormir. Nebula and Rhodes observed as the two quickly left the desolate planet, with Nebula noting that she had supplied the Benatar with the coordinates for Vormir and that the two Avengers would only need to survive the jump point.

Nebula and War Machine discussing the plan
While Black Widow and Hawkeye sojourned for Vormir to retrieve the Soul Stone, War Machine reviewed the plan and asked Nebula if they were supposed to wait for Peter Quill to arrive on Morag and allow him to lead him to the location of the Power Stone, to which Nebula responded that they should take cover. Nebula reminded him that there are others searching for the Stones. Namely Thanos, Gamora, and herself; as Nebula was still a fanatic of Thanos' grand plan in 2014.

Theft of the Power Stone
Nebula steals Peter Quill's equipment
Nebula and War Machine observed as Star-Lord arrived on Morag to claim the Orb for himself while dancing to his Walkman. As the Ravager continued his dance, War Machine nodded his head in thought and commented on Quill being an idiot. Deciding to end the nonsense, War Machine intervened and punched Star-Lord, knocking him unconscious as Nebula looted his thief tools to enter the Temple Vault.

Nebula stealing the Orb from the forcefield
As the two finally entered the shrine, War Machine, having seen too many movies, was hesitant to enter, urging Nebula to be wary of traps, only for her to shake her head in annoyance, and she casually walked into the chamber, dismissing his fears of the imaginery booby traps. Exploring the Temple Vault, she located the Orb being protected by a force field. She approached it and reached in the pedestal, bypassing the incineration field and retrieved the Orb at the cost of her arm getting severely burnt.

Nebula is trapped in 2014
As War Machine witnesses her cyborg hand at its base mechanics, she remarks how she did not used to be like how she is now; a sentiment War Machine shares, following the airport battle in Germany with the Avengers Civil War. Synchronizing their Quantum Bands, War Machine activated his return beacon, but Nebula was unable to, as the probing of her younger self's memories caused her cybernetics to malfunction. With their memories intertwined, she witnessed Thanos researching her memories through the shared network with the 2014 Nebula. The 2014 version of Nebula swore her loyalty to her father despite her seeming betrayal in the future, and Thanos decided to use her to achieve his goals quicker than he ever thought.
