<html><p>Potts then asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. for her husband's condition and she informed them that his condition was critical, so Potts, understanding that these were his final moments, assured her husband that everyone was going to be fine, and that he could finally rest now. He then died as Potts consoled him with a smile. Potts kissed her husband's cheek and began to weep as she rested her head on Stark's body.

Tony Stark's Funeral
Potts watches Tony Stark's final message
A week later, a funeral was held for her husband at their house. Inside the house, Potts played her husband's final message in front of her, their daughter, Happy Hogan, James Rhodes, Steve Rogers, Thor, and Clint Barton. Seeing her husband again in the recording caused Potts to become emotional, though Potts took comfort in him voicing his eternal love for his family.

They then went outside and Potts saw Wanda Maximoff, Sam Wilson, Bucky Barnes, Peter Parker and his aunt, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Scott Lang, the Pym family, Stephen Strange, Wong, T'Challa, Shuri, Okoye, the Barton family, Harley Keener, Thaddeus Ross, Maria Hill, Carol Danvers, and Nick Fury there to honor Stark. Potts walked with her daughter to the lake and sent Stark's old Arc Reactor adrift.

Stark Relief Foundation
In mid 2024, Potts gave a check to Happy Hogan to be given to May Parker for her charity organization.

Personality
As one of Tony Stark's oldest and closest friends, Pepper knew Stark better than most and has always been there for him, whether he knew it or needed it. Though outsiders would view her as a degrading assistant or lackey, Stark himself appreciated her dedication and how long she took out with him when compared to everyone else and trusted her enough to run Stark Industries but his own self-obsession irritated and occasionally drove her away due to forgetting her birthday and buying her strawberries as a gift, the one thing on earth that she is allergic to.

Despite knowing her place, Potts does not take disrespect to herself lightly. A sarcastic woman, when Christine Everhart condescends to her, she retains her decorum but snidely insinuates Everhart to be trash she needs to take out. With Stark, despite being her boss, Potts is not above a barbed remark for him such as buying herself a birthday gift with Tony's money when he forgot and keeping his Arc Reactor in a glass case, reading; "PROOF TONY STARK HAS A HEART". She seems to dislike violence in general, becoming deeply shocked by the explosion of the Hammer Drones at the Stark Expo and disgusted over violently killing Aldrich Killian with Extremis.

Even though Potts has proven to be a defining point for Stark's development and maturity, the relationship between the two of them is a definite struggle. At times, although he originally took up the mantle of Iron Man because the world needed it, Potts became to realize that Stark needed to be Iron Man more, causing strain as his tinkering and his suits were only a distraction to what really mattered in his life. His actions over the anxiety of a world with gods and aliens were designed to protect the ones he loves, which included her. However, this also pushed her away further. Ultron was designed to be the last line of defense for Earth against these threats so Stark being Iron Man would no longer be a necessity, but as his mistake created more problems and thus more reasons why he needed to be Iron Man, Potts could no longer be in a relationship with him and they decided to take a break. Despite these setbacks, Pepper decided to look past them and she ultimately got back with Stark once the Avengers Civil War was over and even helped Stark introduce Peter Parker as the newest member of the Avengers though when he declined, Stark decided to propose to her. When Stark was presumed dead again by the world during the Infinity War, Pepper was one of the few who knew he was alive and she demanded Stark to come back to her when she learned he became Iron Man again.

5 years after the Snap, Pepper has since lived a quiet life with Tony and their only daughter, Morgan, in their lakeside cabin. Though Tony showed understandable reluctance at the prospect of possibly losing his family in their plot to undo the Snap, Pepper convinced him to do so anyway, showing that she has grown much more supportive of Tony and is willing to risk her own family's future if it means saving everyone else's. Pepper, despite having no experience on the battlefield, bravely charged alongside many of her allies in the Battle of Earth and carried herself with poise and dignity despite watching her husband die before her once the battle ended.

Powers and Abilities
Iron Man Armor: Mark XLIX Capabilities
Support Powers
Superhuman Strength: To be added
Pepper flying with War Machine
Flight: With the repulsor technology included in the Mark XLIX armor, Pepper is able to utilize the repulsors in her suit to enable flight.
Heads Up Display (HUD): Like Stark's armors, the suit contains a heads up display within the helmet to allow Potts to analyze the environment. She can utilize the display for targeting assistance.
Defensive Powers
Superhuman Durability: Wearing the Mark XLIX armor, Pepper is granted an incredible durability to kinetic impacts as well as exposure to energy blasts or any other form of enemy fire. This durability is placed on display during the Battle for Earth when she along with the other heroes battling against the forces of Thanos were abruptly bombarded by a devastating missile strike ordered by the Mad Titan.
Offensive Powers
Repulsors: Besides flight, the repulsor technology in her suit enables Potts to battle offensively by unleashing energy blasts from her hands, similar to Iron Man and War Machine.
Former Powers
Pepper empowered by Extremis
Artificially Enhanced Physiology: Thanks to Extremis, Potts temporarily displayed various superhuman abilities, such as strength, agility, and enhanced healing factor, and the ability to generate intense heat. However, Tony Stark was able to negate all of its effects and had the Extremis removed from her body.

Superhuman Strength: Extremis enhanced Potts' muscles to the point of being able to make a hole in one of the Iron Man Armors and rip its arm to use it as a weapon
Superhuman Agility: Extremis enhanced Potts' speed and agility to the point where she was able to effortlessly dodge a repulsor attack.
Regenerative Healing Factor: Extremis allowed Potts to heal at a remarkable rate. She managed to survive a great fall, and walk away with no injuries at all.
Exothermic Manipulation: Hosts of the Extremis virus are able to consciously raise the temperature of parts of their bodies. The effect can be controlled to the extent that it might only scorch skin, or increased to the point where it can cause steel to turn into a molten state.
Abilities
Expert Businesswoman: Pepper Potts is an exceptionally capable businesswoman with a very forceful personality. Ultimately, Stark entrusted her with his family's company and she expanded it from Los Angeles to New York to Washington, D.C. in the United States alone.
Pilot: While fighting in the Battle of Earth, Potts demonstrated the ability to perform complex aerial maneuvers in the Iron Man Armor: Mark XLIX.
