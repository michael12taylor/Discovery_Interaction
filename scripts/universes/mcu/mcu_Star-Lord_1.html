Peter Jason Quill is a Celestial-Human hybrid who was abducted from Earth in 1988 by the Yondu Ravager Clan, eventually building a reputation as the notorious intergalactic outlaw Star-Lord. In 2014, he decided to leave the Ravagers and operate individually, unintentionally becoming a key player in the quest for a precious artifact known as the Orb after stealing it from Morag. Following his arrest, he forged an uneasy alliance with fellow inmates Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot, who together formed the Guardians of the Galaxy. They first rallied as a team by stopping Ronan the Accuser from destroying Xandar with the Power Stone.

A few months later, Ayesha and the Sovereign hired Quill and the other Guardians to defend Anulax Batteries from an Abilisk. However, after Rocket stole some of the batteries, Ayesha sent the Sovereign fleet after them. The Guardians were saved when the fleet was destroyed by Ego, Quill's biological father, whom Quill had never met before. Quill then spent a few days bonding with his father. However, when Ego revealed that he was responsible for the death of Meredith Quill (Quill's mother), Quill allied with his fellow Guardians to prevent Ego's quest to terraform the universe. After killing Ego and witnessing Yondu Udonta's sacrifice, Quill continued to lead the Guardians of the Galaxy and eventually started a relationship with Gamora.

The Guardians of the Galaxy then encountered Thor and began racing against Thanos to procure the Infinity Stones. Splitting up into two groups, Quill led Gamora, Drax, and Mantis to Knowhere to recover the Reality Stone from the Collector, only to lose both it and Gamora to Thanos. Quill, Drax, and Mantis later traveled to Titan to confront Thanos in person. With help from Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man, the Guardians fought Thanos, during which Quill was devastated to learn that Thanos had killed Gamora. In his anger, Quill unintentionally gave Thanos an opening to strike back, and Quill, alongside his allies, was ultimately defeated. Thanos eventually succeeded in his goal and wiped out half of all life in the universe; Quill and most of the Guardians of the Galaxy were among the victims.

In 2023, five years after his death, Quill was resurrected along with all the other lives claimed by the Snap. He then returned to Earth with the help of Strange, participating in the Battle of Earth, where he encountered a Gamora from an alternate timeline. After the battle, Quill attended Stark's funeral with the Guardians. Quill and the team then flew to New Asgard to retrieve Thor, who had decided to join the Guardians, as Quill continued to search for the alternate Gamora.

Biography
Early Life
Fatherless Childhood
Peter Quill was born in late 1980 to Meredith Quill and Ego, making him a hybrid of human and Celestial. His conception was all part of a plot set up by his father to produce a second Celestial, whose power he could use to complete the Expansion, which involved assimilating millions of worlds into Ego's very being. Peter was only one in thousands of different children that Ego conceived over the course of millions of years, though all who came before him were killed and thrown aside, failing to meet Ego's expectations.

Peter with his mother Meredith Quill
Quill never knew his father, as Ego left Earth shortly after his son was conceived. Quill grew up in St. Charles, Missouri under the care of his mother and grandfather. Throughout his childhood, Quill became something of a wild child, getting into numerous fights. He became very close to his mother, who brought together some of her favorite songs from her childhood into a mixtape she titled "Awesome Mix Vol. 1." When other children asked where his father was, Quill told them that his dad was David Hasselhoff and was busy with his career.

Kidnapping of Peter Quill
Losing his Mother
Quill listening to his Walkman
When he was eight years old, Peter's mother became afflicted with terminal brain cancer that, unbeknownst to Peter, was caused by Ego, who feared that his son's growing attachment to Meredith would turn him away from his Expansion plan. His mother's illness worsened over time, and shortly before she died, she gave Peter a present and a note attached to it. In her final moments, she begged Peter to hold her hand, but he could not bear to look at her. She died seconds later, leaving Peter distraught and screaming for her as he was pulled from the room by his grandfather.

Quill is abducted onto Yondu Udonta's ship
Directly after her death, Quill ran out of the hospital crying, and was suddenly abducted from Earth by the Ravagers. Their mission was to take him to his father in deep space but their leader, Yondu Udonta, knew very well of Ego's nature and plans. So, he instead decided that they would keep Quill as their own and chose never to tell him about his father. To help Quill understand the various languages out there, he had a translation chip surgically implanted in his neck.

Raised by Ravagers
Quill being trained by Yondu Udonta
The Ravagers taught Quill how to be the perfect thief. Quill later recalled how, growing up in a Ravager clan, Yondu Udonta had often "kicked the crap out of [him]" in order to teach him how to fight and kept him in terror by threatening to eat him. He also told Quill that they kept him because he was a skinny kid who could squeeze into places that adults couldn't therefore making it easier for thieving. Quill is later told that the threat of being eaten was actually a joke, but as a child he believed it to be serious.

As he grew older, Quill started going by the name Star-Lord, which was a nickname given to him by his mother. Yondu Udonta gave Quill an M-Ship when he was ten years old, that Quill named the Milano, after his childhood crush Alyssa Milano. Quill's extensive Nova Corps criminal record includes 1 count of fraud, 2 counts of public intoxication, 1 count of assault and 1 count of illegal manipulation of a Gramosian Duchess. Though Rhomann Dey picked him up for petty theft on one of Quill's capers, the charge was not put on his record. As Quill himself admits, he's slept with a variety of women from other species; one stabbed him when he tried to sneak out.

Quest for the Orb
Discovering The Orb
Star-Lord arrives on Morag to find the Orb
Living in space for 26 years, Quill built up a reputation as the self-proclaimed legendary outlaw "Star-Lord" and continued to work for Yondu Udonta. During his time with the Ravagers, Quill had become disloyal to them, eventually planning to leave. When Udonta was given a job by the Broker to steal a mysterious item called the Orb from Morag, Quill decided to steal the Orb for himself and flew to the planet.

Star-Lord successfully discovers the Orb
Quill flew his ship to Morag where he used his Holo-Map Projector to locate an ancient temple where he believed the Orb was being held. As Star-Lord made his way through all of the various traps and dangers waiting for him in a temple, including little Orloni which had attempted to attack him; he kept himself entertained as he went through the temple by playing his own Walkman and danced to the music, until he managed to locate the Orb inside the Temple Vault, but found it unprotected and so proceeded to use one of his Gravity Mines to pull it out of its shielded display and steal it, finding the job much easier than he had expected.

Star-Lord is threatened by Korath the Pursuer
However, just as he prepared to get away with his prize, Star-Lord was attacked by Korath the Pursuer and his team of Sakaarans who demanded that he drop the Orb. When Star-Lord tried to claim that he was just a junker, Korath noted that he was clearly a member of the Ravagers. Not believing his stories, Korath then ordered his men to take Star-Lord back to Ronan the Accuser for questioning as Star-Lord's name clearly did not impress Korath at all.

Star-Lord manages to escape from Morag
Quill was able to distract Korath and killed his Sakaaran soldiers by using his Plasma Sphere before he then shot Korath with his Quad Blasters. Believing he was now safe, Star-Lord picked the Orb up and made his escape while being chased down by Korath. Star-Lord used his jet boots to pick up speed as he made it to the Milano and used the Gravity Mine again to stop the other soldiers from shooting at him, all while Korath furiously ran closely behind him.

Star-Lord escapes from the Sakaaran soldiers
Having taken off his helmet, Star-Lord started up his ship and flew away from Morag while Korath still shot at him from a large cannon, forcing Star-Lord to use his flying skills to dodge the blasts. Once he had gotten away from the Kree soldier, Star-Lord confidently began cheering until he accidentally flew into a blast of steam which almost caused him to crashland until he was just able to regain control of his ship and then continued to make his hasty escape.

Star-Lord is surprised by Bereet's appearance
While he was flying away from Morag and catching his breath from the ordeal, Star-Lord was then startled when he discovered that his date Bereet was still inside the ship. Quill had forgotten that she was there when he went on his heist, something which he quickly informed her of while he left Morag in order to take the Orb away and sell it for a huge profit.

Quill is confronted by a furious Yondu Udonta
While traveling through space and listening to reports on the Kree-Nova War, Bereet then inadvertently answered a call from Yondu Udonta, who informed Quill that he and his Ravagers had arrived on Morag to find that the Orb was already taken. Much to Udonta's rage, Quill refused to tell him where he was and what his plans were, as Udonta then threatened him and confronted him about breaking the Ravager code before Quill hung up.

Bounty Hunters Attack
Star-Lord brings the Orb to Broker
Star-Lord went to Xandar in order to sell the Orb, saying goodbye to Bereet before he left. He brought it to the Broker who had made the deal with Yondu Udonta in hopes of selling it to another buyer. The merchant refused to take the Orb after Quill told him that Korath the Pursuer had been working for Ronan the Accuser, who desired to destroy Xandar.

Star-Lord attempts to flirt with Gamora
As he was being pushed outside of Broker's Shop, Quill protested Broker's actions before he encountered Gamora, who was standing outside the shop watching the commotion. Changing his tone, Quill claimed that the Broker had quit on a deal and did not have any integrity, like he did. Quill then attempted to flirt with Gamora, introducing himself as Star-Lord while Gamora seemed less than impressed by him, despite calling him a man of honor which Quill agreed with.

Star-Lord fights against Gamora for the Orb
While Quill continued to try and flirt with Gamora, he was suddenly attacked and kicked in the chest as Gamora took the Orb from his hand and attempted to get away. Quill quickly used Energy Bolas to trip over Gamora before chasing after her and trying to wrestle the Orb away from her hands. However, Quill quickly found himself being overpowered by the assassin, who drew Godslayer and prepared to kill him while Quill was pinned down and defenseless.

Star-Lord attempts to escape with the Orb
Moments before Gamora could execute Star-Lord, however, he was inadvertently saved when Gamora was also attacked by the outlaw duo of Rocket Raccoon and Groot, who both desired the bounty that had been placed on Quill's head by the Ravagers, which stunned him to see well-known species from Earth walking and talking. While Gamora attempted to fight off the two bounty hunters so she could regain the Orb, Star-Lord attempted to escape, only to have Gamora throw a knife at his hand and cause him to drop the Orb once again. The pair then wrestled for the Orb with Star-Lord losing the fight again and was pinned to the ground and called a fool by Gamora.

Star-Lord is almost captured by Groot
Refusing to be defeated, however, Star-Lord distracted Gamora by teaser her while he placed one of his Jet Boot Attachments and then activated it, causing Gamora to be sent flying backwards. While Quill celebrated, he was then captured by Groot, only for Gamora to free him by cutting off Groot's arms. Once the bag was opened, Star-Lord used the chance to shoot Gamora with his Quad Blasters and then attempted to escape on foot with the Orb still in his hand.

Star-Lord is arrested by Rhomann Dey
However, before he could get away from his attackers, Star-Lord was shot by Rocket's Laser Cannon, causing him to fall to the floor in agony while Rocket laughed at him. After a lengthy chase, all four were eventually apprehended by the Nova Corps, Quill was arrested by Rhomann Dey, who he had previously been arrested by. Picking him up, Dey teased Quill by mistaking his name as "Star-Prince," much to his annoyance as he was taken away.

Held in the Kyln
Star-Lord arriving inside the Kyln
Once they all arrived in their holding cells, Star-Lord and the others were forced into a line up by the Nova Corps where all of their own criminal histories were presented for Garthan Saal by Rhomann Dey. Frustrated by this experience, Star-Lord amused himself by giving the middle finger to those looking at him before claiming that it was an accident.

Star-Lord is taken to the Kyln for his sentence
The group was sent to the Kyln by Saal to begin their sentence, where they all arrived together and continued their disagreements. Quill compared Rocket Raccoon to a normal raccoon that he remembered from Earth. Quill began questioning what Gamora had planned for the Orb until, eventually, she revealed to them that she was planning on betraying Ronan the Accuser and selling the Orb to a third party who she refused to name. Also, Quill wondered why Groot could only say three words repeatedly.

Quill demands to get his Walkman back
Quill then spotted one of the mean guards using his own Walkman, Quill quickly stepped through the doorway into the guard's quarters in order to ensure the Walkman was not lost forever. While the others watched, Quill confronted the guard and demanded that he put the Walkman into storage, noting that the song was Blue Swede as the guard refused and instead used a taser rod to then electrocute Quill, knocking him to the floor and easily subduing him.

Quill is threatened by the Nova Corps
Quill and all the others were then processed by the Nova Corps as he was stripped down and washed, humiliating him. When Quill then attempted to confront the guards over his treatment, Quill soon found himself being threatened by armed Hoverbots which kept him in his place. While being given his prison uniform, Quill was briefly put into the same cell as Rocket Raccoon where he noticed the cybernetic enhancements attached to Rocket's back, although Quill did not comment on them and instead sat in complete silence.

Quill and the others are threatened in the Kyln
Once Quill and the other members of the group had been processed and stepped into the prison, Gamora was threatened due to her own connection with Ronan and Thanos. Quill himself then almost found himself a target in the prison when a monstrous inmate attempted to start a fight. However, Quill was saved by both Rocket and Groot who defeated the Inmate in a humiliating fashion and declared that Quill was their booty and no one else was to go near them, Quill did not argue and proudly stated that he was truly with them.

Saving Gamora
Quill attempts to sleep while inside the Kyln
Quill went to sleep in the group quarters while Gamora got her own personal cell where the prisoners continued to threaten her. During his night in the Kyln, Quill found himself in a tightly kept room where he had to rest of the backs of the other prisoners. However, while he could not sleep, Quill overheard Gamora being abducted by one of the guards as well as some of the other prisoners.

Quill watches Gamora being ambushed
Not willing to let her die, Quill followed the activity along with Rocket Raccoon where he found Moloka Dar attempting to slice Gamora's throat before Drax the Destroyer appeared from the shadows and furiously demanded that he be the one to execute Gamora in order to avenge his late wife and daughter. Quill watched as Dar handed Drax his knife, while Gamora tried to get free and claimed to be no family to Thanos and was the only one able to stop Thanos.

Quill saves Gamora from Drax the Destroyer
As Drax furiously pinned Gamora to the wall and tried to kill her, Quill jumped forward and attempted to distract and keep Drax from killing Gamora. When Drax noted Gamora had tried to kill him, Quill noted all the women, including A'askavariian who had tried to kill him in the past. Quill then tried to convince Drax that, since she had now betrayed Ronan the Accuser, he would likely come for her allowing Drax to finally exact his revenge, which he soon accepted.

Quill and Gamora discuss selling the Orb
Quill had assured Gamora that he didn't care about her well-being, but knew that she would be able to show him where to sell the Orb. Gamora agreed that if they could escape the prison and retrieve the orb for her third party, she would split all the profit between them all and Groot, who Rocket berated for sleeping through everything. Quill promised that Rocket would be able to help them escape, although Rocket noted he still wanted Yondu Udonta's bounty.

Prison Break
Quill discusses Rocket Raccoon's plan
The next day, Rocket Raccoon devised a plan to break them all out of the Kyln, as a team, they would collect a series of items from across the prison which would allow Rocket and hack into the security tower. Quill expressed his fear that the plan would be impossible to pull off, but Rocket insisted that they try. The plan went awry when Groot completed the last step first, setting off the alarms.

Quill successfully takes a man's false leg
As the Nova Corps began charging into the room to stop Groot and while Gamora went to collect the Angry Guard's own cybernetic arm implant, Quill ran off to steal One Legged Prisoner's false leg, offering the prisoner 30,000 units in exchange. Although the Prisoner was highly confused by the offer, he soon accepted and Quill got the leg as Rocket had requested. As he charged back outside, avoiding the gunfire, Quill was almost recaptured by one of the guards but was able to use the false leg to quickly defend himself.

Star-Lord shoots down the attacking hoverbots
Having taken the subdued guard's gun for himself, Quill made his way towards the security tower, shooting at the hoverbots that tried to stop him. While Quill attempted to continue the mission, Groot and Rocket continued to be fired on by the other hoverbots in order to regain the Quarnyx Battery Groot had stolen, causing chaos for all the other prisoners. Rocket continued his part of the plan until he was finally ready for all of the others to regroup with him.

Quill's life is saved by Drax the Destroyer
Quill began climbing up Groot's leg in order to get into the security tower, but soon himself defenseless and with a drone aiming it's guns directly at him. However, before Quill could be killed, he was assisted by Drax the Destroyer, who joined them in order to find and kill Ronan the Accuser. Drax celebrated ripping the drone apart with his bare hands while referring to Quill as one who had previously laid with an A'askavariian, much to Quill's embarrassment.

Quill and his new allies make their escape
Once they got into the Watchtower and locked the door behind them, Gamora confronted Star-Lord about why Drax had been allowed to join them. Rocket then revealed that stealing the leg was simply a joke, which greatly annoyed Quill due to the money he had spent to get it. They soon found the Head Riot Guard had gathered his team as they attempt to shoot the Watchtower while Rocket worked. Quill began to worry Rocket did not have a plan until he managed to turn on the anti-gravity and flew the watchtower to safety.

Star-Lord tells the others to go to his ship
Now safely out of the way of the Nova Corps, Quill and the others prepared to escape into deep space onboard the Milano. As they all began collecting their belongings, Quill noticed that the mean guard had stolen his Walkman for himself. Determined not to lose his most prized possession due to its connection to his mother, Quill gave Gamora his own bag, claiming it contained the Orb and went to find the guard, telling the others to wait for him to get back.

Star-Lord prepares to fight the Nova Corps
In reality, however, Quill had kept the Orb with him to ensure that the others did not leave without him as he knew they would not leave the chance to sell it to their buyer and make a large profile, so Quill changed into his own clothes and went on his mission to reclaim his Walkman. Star-Lord fought through all the guards using his Quad Blasters, easily subduing them before they had a chance to fight back. When one of the guards he had knocked down complained about seriously damaging his next, Star-Lord continued walking past him and shot him once again with a blast of electricity, knocking him out while Star-Lord continued searching for his Walkman.

Star-Lord takes back his Walkman from the guard
Having taken out most the other Nova Corps guards, Star-Lord eventually found the guard who was listening to "Escape (The Piña Colada Song)" on his Walkman. With the guard distracted by the music, Star-Lord sneaked up on his before knocking out the guard who had stolen it with a blow from the Orb. Star-Lord then focused his efforts on regrouping with the others who were being forced to wait for him to finally return to the ship with the Orb.

Star-Lord flying through space to the Milano
Using his own Helmet to survive in deep space, Star-Lord then flew outside the prison to the ship, where Drax the Destroyer was amazed by his brave efforts. Once Star-Lord was back onboard, he handed Gamora the Orb while Drax complimented him on all his incredible bravery and questioned what he had left them to collect, noting he would be a key ally in the battle against Ronan the Accuser. However, when Quill then revealed what it was he had gone back for, Drax then called him an imbecile for risking his life for such an item.

Keeping the Peace
Quill finds and confronts Rocket Raccoon
On the Milano, Quill found Rocket Raccoon pulling apart bits of his ship to build weapons, including the Hadron Enforcer. Quill was furious and told him to stop, noting that he did not want any bombs or moon destroying weapons on his ship. When Rocket suggested putting the bomb in a box, he tried to use the box of Meredith Quill's present to Quill, to which he insisted he does not touch it.

Quill and the other discussing about the Orb
Quill then asked Gamora to give him her buyer's coordinates which she refused to do, leading to a conversation about who trusted the other more. They began discussing what the Orb really was, with Drax the Destroyer excitingly asking if it was a weapon that they could use to kill Ronan the Accuser, leading to an argument between him and Gamora which Quill was forced to break up as he insisted that nobody kill anyone onboard his ship. Upon commenting on the large sum that was going to be paid to the group, Drax claimed to have no interest in money which Quill joked meant more money for the rest of them, including Groot who was listening on.

Quill makes a crude joke about his own ship
Quill then stated that the dysfunctional group was going to have to start trusting each other if they were actually going to start working together as a new team, but Gamora showed little interest in having anything to do with any of them after they had all sold the Orb. As Gamora walked away from the group, she noted that Quill's ship was filthy, to which Quill claimed that under a black light it would look like a Jackson Pollock painting, much to the disgust of Rocket.

Trouble On Knowhere
Quill and the Guardians arrive at Knowhere
While practicing with his Quad Blasters, Quill was informed that they were now arriving on Knowhere, a remote criminal outpost in space built in the giant severed-head of a Celestial. As they explored Knowhere, Quill told the group about his time of the Earth, describing it as a planet of outlaws which Drax the Destroyer expressed interest in visiting.

Quill and Gamora discuss the upcoming deal
The group decided to relax while waiting to meet Gamora's contact, The Collector. Once he had filled the Milano up with fuel, Quill joined Gamora outside and they spent time together where they discussed her relationship with her adoptive father, Thanos. Gamora told Quill how Thanos had murdered her entire family in front of her before he took her into his custody and turning her into a weapon, explaining that when he agreed to destroy Xandar for a new deal with Ronan the Accuser, that was the moment she chose to betray him.

Quill attempts to share a kiss with Gamora
Gamora asked about Quill's Walkman and why he had gone back for it during the Escape from the Kyln, Quill explained that it had been a gift from his mother before her death. Telling her that he used the Walkman to listen to music and dance, he even allowed Gamora to listen to his music before trying to kiss her. However, Gamora drew her knife and held it directly to Quill's throat, refusing to kiss him and accusing him of trying to trick her, which he denied.

Quill breaks up Rocket Raccoon and Drax
However, they were interrupted by the fight that had just broken out between Drax, Rocket Raccoon and Groot. Quill and Gamora broke up the fight between the three. As Rocket still tried to fight, Quill reminded him to sell the Orb for billions of units first then he could leave them for good. Quill told Rocket, Drax, Gamora, and Groot that their lack of trust for others has prevented them from ever making friends. However, Quill could not stop Drax from leaving, as he was furious that he still had not had a chance to kill Ronan.

Meeting the Collector
Quill stands inside the Collector's museum
While the group let Drax the Destroyer walk away, they were then greeted by Carina, the assistant of the Collector, who finally invited them into the Collector's Museum which housed several species and items in cages, including Dark Elves and Howard the Duck. Quill took a step back and watched as the Collector then greeted Gamora and questioned if he could buy Groot from them, as he wished to have his corpse in his own collection someday. Quill then presented the Orb to the Collector, briefly dropping it onto the floor.

Quill learns the history of the Infinity Stones
As the Collector began to open the Orb, he explained that it was, in fact, one of the Infinity Stones, an item of immeasurable power that was capable of destroying entire planets and kills all but the most powerful beings who wield it. The Collector then showed the group footage of one of the Celestials using the Orb's power to destroy a planet, as Quill claimed it was scary enough to make him pee while the Collector marveled at the Power Stone in the Orb.

Quill and Gamora avoid the Orb's explosion
With his demonstration now over, Rocket Raccoon insisted that the Collector now pay them for their trouble. Before the Collector could pay them all, however, his tormented assistant who wanted to use the power to be free grabbed the stone, triggering an explosion that engulfed his collection while ripping the screaming Carina apart from the inside. The team barely managed to survive the explosion as Groot pulled Rocket outside while Quill and Gamora hid behind a desk and barely dodged the flames.

Skirmish on Knowhere
Quill argues about where to take the Orb
As they left the Collector's Museum with the Power Stone now back encased within the Orb, Quill found that Rocket Raccoon was utterly horrified by seeing that they still had the Orb after witnessing its true power, claiming that they should just give it back to Ronan the Accuser and escape. Quill suggested they give it to Yondu Udonta in exchange for money.

Quill is cornered by Yondu Udonta's Ravagers
Before they could continue arguing, Ronan and Nebula arrived with their entire army of Sakaarans behind them. Having learned that Drax the Destroyer had called his enemy for a chance to kill him to avenge his murdered family, Quill looked on in horror before realizing that Udonta and his own team of Ravagers had also arrived to find and capture him. With limited options, Gamora attempted to flee with Orb only to be pursued by Nebula while Quill followed behind.

Star-Lord pilots one of the Mining Pods
Taking command of Mining Pods alongside Rocket, Quill and Rocket assisted Gamora in fighting off the Sakaaran's Necrocraft which were attempting to shoot her out of the sky in order to reclaim the Orb. During their arial battle, Star-Lord and Rocket managed to destroy many of the Sakaaran ships as Quill recommended to Rocket that they begin using the Mining Pods as battering rams causing Ronan's battleships to crash land on Knowhere and then explode.

Star-Lord takes control of a Necrocraft's guns
While Drax fought against Ronan on the ground, Star-Lord attempted to gain the advantage in the fight by using his Mining Pod's claws to rip open one of the Necrocraft and pull out the Sakaaran driving it. Star-Lord then proceeded to use the Necrocraft's weapons to shoot the other ships out of the sky, trying to allow Gamora to get away with the Orb. However, despite Star-Lord's best efforts, Gamora had eventually found herself cornered by all of Nebula's ships.

Star-Lord watches Gamora freezing to death
With no other choice, Gamora was forced to fly out into deep space where Nebula destroyed her Pod and retrieved the Orb, leaving her sister to die in space. Star-Lord and Rocket watched this from afar, as their Mining Pods did not have the power to get closer. Rocket recommended they turn back before they got trapped, but Star-Lord refused to allow Gamora to die. Calling Yondu Udonta and telling him his location, Star-Lord made his decision to save Gamora.

Quill saving Gamora from freezing in space
Star-Lord proceeded to exit his pod and flew through deep space to reach Gamora, despite all of Rocket's protests that he would not be able to survive in the extreme conditions of deep space. Refusing to listen to Rocket, Star-Lord gave Gamora his mask to help her survive while his own body began to freeze from the extreme cold and lack of oxygen. Before Quill could suffocate and die in space, they were both then surrounded by the Eclector piloted by Udonta.

Quill claims all his own actions were heroic
With moments to spare, Star-Lord and Gamora were rescued by the Ravagers and Udonta who then teleported them on board. Looking Gamora in the eye, Quill told her that he had not been able to bring himself to allow her to die, claiming that he was being very heroic in doing so. As Quill revealed that Ronan the Accuser had reclaimed the Orb during the battle, Kraglin Obfonteri and a team of Ravagers then held them at gunpoint and took them into their custody.

Deal with Yondu
Quill is furiously confronted by Yondu Udonta
While on Yondu Udonta's ship, Quill was beaten and mocked by his former boss, who was still furious that Quill had betrayed them and stolen the Orb from Morag to try and sell it himself. Quill argued with Udonta about how Udonta claimed Quill should be grateful that he wasn't eaten by the other Ravagers, which enraged Quill as he noted that Udonta had been threatening that ever since he had been taken from Earth by Udonta all those many years earlier.

Quill makes a new deal with Yondu Udonta
Udonta lost patience and aimed his Yaka Arrow at Quill's throat. Quill attempted to talk Udonta out of killing him by telling him that he now knew where the Orb was and claiming that they could work together to retrieve it. Knowing the Orb was with Ronan the Accuser, Udonta claimed that it was impossible to steal it from the Kree: however, Quill noted that with Gamora's help they may have a chance to exploit his weaknesses, at which point Udonta dropped the arrow.

Quill orders Rocket Raccoon to stop attacking
While Quill, Udonta and the other Ravagers celebrated the new deal, suddenly, Rocket Raccoon fired at the Eclector from the Milano. Quill and the others ran to investigate as they all saw that Rocket was explaining that Drax the Destroyer was aiming the Hadron Enforcer at the Eclector and threatened to blow it up with Quill and Gamora were not freed. Rocket gave a short countdown until Drax fired. However, luckily, Quill just managed to defuse the situation in time.

Uniting the Team
Deal with the Ravagers
Quill argues with Rocket Raccoon's actions
Back on the Milano, Quill berated Rocket Raccoon, Groot, and Drax the Destroyer about their foolish attempt to rescue them from Yondu Udonta, in which they would have destroyed the ship if Undonta hadn't handed them over. The group then began to discuss what their next move would be in order to get the Orb back.

Quill argues with the group about a plan
Quill told the group that he has a plan, only to be further asked by Rocket, to which he further noted to have part of a plan. As the group continued discussing a plan, Rocket asked Quill about what percentage, in which he expressed twelve percent. Noticing Rocket's sarcastic laugh, Quill pointed that he didn't believe him, further bothering Rocket. As Groot praises Quill's plan to Rocket, Quill liked Groot's thinking before seeing him eat a leaf on his shoulder.

Quill and the Guardians stand with each other
Eventually, Quill pitched his plan to attack the Dark Aster, kill Ronan the Accuser and take back the Orb, although Rocket argued that the plan seemed like a suicide mission. While Quill had to rest in disappointment on trying to save the galaxy, Gamora stood by Quill and vowed to fight with him as well as Drax to stand amongst the group and vowed to fight with them. As Groot decided to stand and fight with the team, Rocket then agreed to fight alongside them as they and were willing to put their lives on the line to stop Ronan.

Quill begins to start a plan of attack on Xandar
With the rest of the team on board, Quill listened to his Walkman, dressed up for the battle, and equipped his Jet Boot Attachments. It soon didn't take long for the rest of the team to agree to help as well and they went back to the Ravagers' ship to discuss the details of the plan with Udonta and his men. Quill came out with a plan and recruited the Ravagers to help destroy a part of the Dark Aster and let him and Udonta's group to go inside the ship.

Quill explains how he'll kill Ronan the Accuser
Gamora then expanded on the plan that once they go inside the Dark Aster, she will close the dense doorway that will let them unite inside Ronan's room. Quill concluded the plan that he'll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan, letting the Ravagers to have capsules to collect the Power Stone. Rocket attempted to incorporate Vorker's cybernetic eye to be removed for the plan, but was quickly denied by Quill.

Quill discussing the plan with Yondu Udonta
As Quill was walking in the ship and ready to pilot the Milano, Undonta confronted him and told him that if he did not give him the stone at the end of the battle, he and the Ravagers would kill him as well as the other Guardians, much to Quill's uncomfortable stance on Undonta. Quill and the Guardians then part their ways onto the positions of the plan but not long after he decided to call Rhomann Dey and told him of his plan. asking for the help of the Nova Corps.

Battle of Xandar
Quill piloting his ship in battle
Once they arrived at Xandar, Star-Lord's team and the Ravagers put the plan into action and Quill warned Rhomann Dey so that he could tell the rest of the Nova Corps. Ronan the Accuser arrived on Xandar with the Dark Aster and thousands of Sakaaran soldiers.

Quill flies into the battle with his new allies
Quill and the Ravagers engaged them in a massive aerial battle, as they were quickly attacked by swarms of Necrocraft sent by Ronan, who overwhelmed them, even managing to shoot Yondu Udonta's battleship out of the sky. While Kraglin Obfonteri and Rocket Raccoon shot a hole in the side of the ship to allow Quill and Yondu Udonta to board. However, the Nova Corps, led by Garthan Saal under the orders of Irani Rael, arrived helped in the battle, much to Quill's surprise for their acceptance.

Quill abruptly crashes inside the Dark Aster
While Saal and Rocket kept Ronan's entire army at bay with the aid of the Ravagers, Quill was able to land the Milano inside the Dark Aster through a hole blasted in by Rocket. As they crash landed into the ship, Quill used the ship's guns to kill dozens of the Sakaarans inside, as Drax the Destroyer could not hold back his glee and cheered with delight to which Quill was told by Gamora that they're just like Kevin Bacon.

Quill sees Groot generating spores of light
Once they landed and left the crashed ship, they discovered that the Dark Aster was too dark for them to see so Groot used his powers to create a strange light across the ship to show them the way. When Drax questioned how Groot could do it, Star-Lord noted the answer would likely be "I am Groot." As they made their way across the ship, they were suddenly stopped by Nebula who attempted to kill the Guardians of the Galaxy, Drax shot her with his rocket launcher.

Quill fighting against Sakaaran soldiers
With the threat of Nebula seemingly dealt with the team, they split up, having Gamora going to unlock the security doors while Star-Lord, Drax, and Groot made their way through the Sakaaran army towards Ronan's location. They were eventually confronted by a team led by Korath the Pursuer, who said his alias, much to Star-Lord's delight. While the team battled the small army of Sakaaran soldiers, Star-Lord used both of his Quad Blasters to kill them.

Quill and Drax the Destroyer watches Groot
Star-Lord was then forced to battle Korath, who easily overpowered him despite his best efforts. Drax then came to Quill's aid and personally engaged in a fierce battle against Korath and managed to kill him by ripping out one of his cranial implants, electrocuting him to death. After Drax had killed Korath, Quill listened to him saying that he was making a metaphor of his murder, leading Quill to semi-agree with him. Just as Star-Lord considered correcting Drax on the meaning of a metaphor, they were attacked by another large team of Sakaarans sent by Ronan. Before they could engage in another battle against the soldier, Star-Lord and Drax then witnessed Groot massacre the entire team of Sakaarans.

Quill finally attacks Ronan the Accuser
As they continued toward, they discovered that the door was still locked due to Gamora being busy battling against Nebula. Eventually, they made it to Ronan and Quill shot him with the Hadron Enforcer; however, Ronan is unaffected by the attack. For a moment, they were defenseless, Drax was held by the throat by Ronan, but before he could kill them, Rocket comes crashing in with his own ship heavily damaging the Dark Aster, causing it to crash.

Quill saves Rocket Raccoon from his ship
Once the team had recovered from the explosive crash, Quill pulled the injured Rocket out of the crashed ship and he joined the rest of the group, believing Ronan to be dead and their own lives to be lost when the ship crashed to the ground. As the team had huddled together, Groot had the idea to cover the group up, forming a branch over them and shielded them out of his body, seemingly at the cost of his life.

Quill witnesses Ronan the Accuser's return
As Groot continued to make a dome around the team, Quill noticed the spores of light from the inside while Rocket had woken up from his crash. When the Dark Aster crash landed to the ground, Groot's body was destroyed and the rest of the team survived with only minor injuries. Listening to "O-o-h Child" by the Five Stairsteps, Quill woke up from the ground and looked over the team to ensure they were all okay, only to witness Ronan, exiting the wreckage of his ship.

Self Sacrifice
Quill challenges Ronan to a dance off
Ronan began to mock the injured team, calling them the Guardians of the Galaxy, which the group took a liking to. As he prepared to use the Infinity Stone to destroy Xandar, Quill, seeing no other option, distracted Ronan by dancing to "O-o-h Child" by the Five Stairsteps and challenging Ronan to a dance-off.

Quill's body is ripped apart by the Orb
While Ronan stared at Quill with utter confusion. Quill tried to get Gamora to participate, to which she declined. Ronan then asked Quill what he is doing, to which he replied that he's creating a distraction. This allowed the time for Drax and Rocket to repair the Hadron Enforcer and use it to destroy his hammer. As the Infinity Stone hung in the air, Quill willingly sacrificed himself and grabbed the stone. The stone's power began to rip Quill's body apart, causing him unbearable pain. Gamora comes to Quill's aid asking him to take her hand hearing those words makes Quill hallucinate an image of his dying mother asking him to take her hand.

Quill withstanding the Power Stone's energy
Having to snap out of the hallucination after hearing Gamora calling out to him again, Quill then took her hand, causing them to share the Power Stone's energy. With both of them taking the pain, Drax the Destroyer came for their aid and began to hang onto Quill's shoulder taking the pain as well along with Rocket Raccoon, who grabbed onto one of Drax's fingers, causing huge amounts of pain for him from the Stone.

Quill seeing Ravagers taking off from their ship
Between all of them, they successfully absorbed its power and were able to control it. Ronan stared in horror, demanding to know how it was possible, Quill responded that they are the Guardians of the Galaxy. The four then directed the Power Stone's power to blast Ronan, obliterating him. With Ronan and his army now destroyed, Yondu Udonta demanded that Quill hand over the Orb despite Quill telling him that it is only safe with the Nova Corps.

Quill makes amends with Rhomann Dey
Once the Ravagers took the Orb, Quill tricked Yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the stone, but actually contained a Troll doll. As the Ravagers left Xandar, they remarked that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father as a child. After the Ravagers left, back on Xandar, Quill spoke to Gamora about how although they would now want him dead, the Ravagers were the only family he had ever known, Gamora told him that wasn't true anymore. Quill gave the real Orb to the Nova Corps.

The Guardians of the Galaxy
Quill listens to his gift from his mother
Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, had their criminal records expunged by the Corps, and Quill learned that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient species that could wield the Infinity Stone without being destroyed.

Quill deciding where to leave with his team
Quill finally opened the last present he received from his mother; a second cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. Once Quill was finished with reading his mother's letter, he puts on his cassette tape on his player and began listening to it while sharing a tear for her memory. The Guardians left in the rebuilt Milano, accompanied by a twig recovered from Groot, which was already regrowing.
