Maria Hill is the former Deputy Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., and also held the title of "Commander". She enjoyed a well-deserved reputation as tough-minded and by the book. Her clearheaded pragmatism was a valued source of reason during the critical discourse surrounding the Avengers Initiative. After Nick Fury faked his death, Hill worked with him and was a part of the assault team that took down the Helicarriers from Project Insight.

Hill joined Stark Industries in the immediate aftermath of the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. to help protect herself from prosecution. However, she stayed in touch with Phil Coulson and S.H.I.E.L.D., acting as an intermediary between the organization and the Avengers during the War on HYDRA. Hill temporarily rejoined Fury as his second-in-command on the Helicarrier No. 64 during the Battle of Sokovia to help defeat the genocidal artificial intelligence Ultron. She later moved to the New Avengers Facility to assist the Avengers.

Following the Avengers Civil War, Hill was fired from Stark Industries by Tony Stark. In 2018, Hill and Fury, along with fifty percent of the universe, were killed when Thanos completed the Infinity Gauntlet. Five years later, Hill was resurrected by Bruce Banner using the Infinity Stones and was among those present at Tony Stark's funeral.

Biography
S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent
Recruited by Director Fury
Maria Hill was born on April 4, 1982. In adulthood, she joined the United States Armed Forces and later S.H.I.E.L.D., rising through its ranks and becoming one of the organization's best agents. Hill had caught the eye of Director Nick Fury and was then appointed as S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Deputy Director, working closely with him.

In 2008, Hill approved the transfer of Melinda May from being an active field agent to working in the administration department due to the traumatic incident she experienced during a Rescue in Bahrain that had killed several active terrorists while May had rescued her team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, but this also cost Katya Belyakov's life who had seemingly been caught in the crossfire.

Chitauri Invasion
Hill and Nick Fury meet with Phil Coulson
Accompanying Nick Fury, Hill visited the Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility where Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. was going underway to monitor the strange amount of energy that the Tesseract was emitting. Once they arrived they were greeted by Phil Coulson who made it clear that they were not aware of the reasons for the sudden surge of energy coming from the Tesseract and noted that Erik Selvig and his team of skilled scientists was still conducting tests to try and regain control of the situation with little success.

Hill questions Nick Fury's mission plans
Upon hearing that the Tesseract was an unstable and serious risk, Fury ordered her to ensure that the Phase 2 prototypes were shipped out and that they evacuate as many staff members as they could. Hill questioned however that an evacuation could be meaningless as an explosion from the Tesseract could be too massive to escape from, but Fury ignored these concerns and instead told Hill to obey his orders.

Destruction of P.E.G.A.S.U.S.
Hill witnesses Clint Barton leaving with Loki
Watching the evacuation of the facility, Hill noticed Clint Barton and Erik Selvig who were going to leave the Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility with Loki. At this stage, Hill believed that Barton must have some kind of good reason to be transporting an unknown person from the facility. However, Hill then got a call on her radio from Nick Fury warning her that Loki had taken control of Barton and stolen the Tesseract. At this point, Hill was forced to take cover as Barton, who was enthralled by Loki, began shooting at her. While Hill waited behind a wall for Barton to stop firing, she heard their jeep startup as they made their escape.

Hill chases down Loki and Clint Barton
Seeing this, Hill fired her weapon at them with little effect, so was forced instead to jump into another jeep and pursued them down the facility. Quickly catching up with them, Hill engaged in a firefight in the facility's tunnel system but failed to stop Loki despite her best efforts as she and Barton each fired shots at one another. The portal that Loki had arrived it began to collapse and created a powerful surge of energy created by the Tesseract that collapsed all the area around it, destroying the facility and causing Hill's jeep to crash when it hit a large falling piece of concrete, very nearly killing her.

Hill hears that Nick Fury is declaring war
Hill became trapped by rubble but survived. She radioed Fury, informing him of what had happened during the chaos and noting that she was unaware of how many people had survived the explosion as she believed the number would be very low. Hill asked Fury what they should do next, with Phil Coulson also letting them know of his own survival. Fury told Hill and Coulson that this situation was now a Level Seven and that they were now at war. As a result, Fury decided that it was time to relaunch the Avengers Initiative as this was a threat that S.H.I.E.L.D. could not handle alone, much to Hill's skepticism.

Assembling the Avengers
Hill witnesses the arrival of the Avengers
After the destruction of the Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility, Hill reported back to the Helicarrier and aided in the administration of events, including the hunt for Clint Barton. She was present when Nick Fury brought together the Avengers and Hill was immediately uneasy about the alliance of the heroes, watching closely as Fury spoke with Bruce Banner whom she considered being a highly serious risk.

Hill speaks with Tony Stark
Before long, Jasper Sitwell was able to locate Loki in Germany and Fury sent Captain America and Black Widow to apprehend him. Loki was soon captured by Rogers and Romanoff with the assistance of Iron Man, as well as the arrival of Thor, who wished to return his brother to Asgard. When Stark arrived with Phil Coulson and began talking in great detail with Banner about how Erik Selvig could use the Tesseract, Hill questioned when Stark had become such an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics and Stark replied that he had last night as he insisted that he had done the research, before he asked Hill how Fury could check his monitors. Hill did not see Stark planting a device on the Helicarrier's computer to download all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.

Attack on the Helicarrier
Hill witnesses Hawkeye attacking the ship
Hill and Phil Coulson watched on a monitor as Nick Fury and the Avengers argued while under the influence of Loki's Scepter. This was interrupted when Clint Barton used an explosive arrow which made the Helicarrier malfunction and started losing altitude. Hill quickly realized that the engine was down and ordered someone to get the engine going again. Tony Stark agreed to repair the engine, with the assistance of Steve Rogers.

Nick Fury and Hill defend the Helicarrier
As Hill was sent to check on the engines, she witnessed a mercenary throwing a grenade into the control room and managed to move out of the way of the explosion. Nick Fury began fighting back the invading forces but was also killed before Hill was able to shoot the mercenary aiming at Fury. Hill and Fury stayed in the control room and ensured that the invading forces did not take control of the Helicarrier while Thor battled Hulk, at which point Fury sent a jet in an attempt to lure Hulk off the ship before he destroyed it.

Losing Phil Coulson
Hill learns that Phil Coulson has been killed
In the aftermath of the battle, Hill had her injuries treated while the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents checked on the damage done to the Helicarrier. Hill learned that Loki had escaped from the Helicarrier in a Quinjet and Thor had been thrown off the ship and could have then been killed, although Hawkeye had been subdued by Black Widow and was recovering from the effects of Loki's mind control. However, Hill was also informed that Phil Coulson had been tragically killed when he was stabbed through the heart by Loki before he could stop him.

Hill listens to Nick Fury's speech
Hill was present when Nick Fury gave a speech to Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, explaining his true intentions of using the Tesseract to recreate HYDRA weapons, and the reasons for forming the Avengers, which was to build a team to fight the battles that S.H.I.E.L.D. never could win. Fury noted that Coulson had died while still believing that the Avengers could be formed and save the world. However, despite his speech, Stark was too upset by Coulson's death and stormed out of the room, leaving Fury to confess that his plan was maybe too old fashioned as Hill had always believed.

Hill speaks to Nick Fury
Hill approached Fury a little while later and explained how she knew that Coulson's vintage trading cards that Fury had shown Rogers was not in Coulson's jacket as Fury has claimed, but in his locker, meaning that Fury had been trying to emotionally manipulate the team. Fury defended himself stating that they needed the push to get them all ready to fight Loki once again. The lie was eventually successful in causing the Avengers to unite and steal a Quinjet in order to find and attack Loki in New York City where he planned on finally unleashing the full power of the Tesseract.

Battle of New York
Hill learns Gideon Malick wants to attack
Hill monitored the Battle of New York as the Avengers fought against Loki's army of the Chitauri, who had successfully invaded Earth through a portal created by the Tesseract which was being powered by Stark Tower. As the odds against the Avengers appeared to be getting lower, Hill informed Fury that the World Security Council were waiting to speak to him. Hill listened in horror as Gideon Malick attempted to convince Fury that they needed to launch a nuclear strike against the city which would kill millions of innocent civilians.

Hill attempts to stop a jet being launched
As Fury refused to obey Malick's direct order, he had his leadership taken away and Hawley took control of a S.H.I.E.L.D. plane, for the purpose of bombing New York City to stop the invasion and also kill Loki, regardless of the number of innocent lives this would destroy. Despite the best efforts of Hill and Fury, with Hill attempting to hack into the jet while Fury even shot it with a rocket, a second plane took off from the Helicarrier and fired a missile at New York City while Hill could only look on in horror while Fury made a new plan to stop the missile and save millions of innocent lives.

Hill watches the Battle of New York
Hill watched the monitors as Iron Man successfully flew the missile into the Wormhole and destroyed the Chitauri Command Center, by doing so effectively ending Loki's invasion; although it appeared that Stark had been killed in the mission, he was able to be revived by the Avengers who then took Loki into custody, as he had been beaten into submission by Hulk and reclaimed the Tesseract, which would be taken back to Asgard despite the requests of the Council as well as Malick and Alexander Pierce, who wanted to continue studying it's incredible and seemingly unexplainable power.

Invasion Aftermath
Hill discusses the future of the Avengers
As the Avengers were departing as a team, Hill spoke to Nick Fury about whether or not they would stay together now they had stopped the Chitauri Invasion and won the Battle of New York. Fury told her that they would because the world would need them to. Accepting this answer, Hill walked back to the center of the Helicarrier and resumed her work.

Resurrection of Phil Coulson
Hill interviewing Agent Grant Ward
Hill was aware that Nick Fury used Project T.A.H.I.T.I. to bring Phil Coulson back to life and aided Fury in keeping the truth hidden from him. She was also aware of Melinda May's true purpose on the team.

Hill interviewed and evaluated Grant Ward after he successfully recovered a Chitauri Neural Link that Vanchat was housing in Paris. Having previously evaluated Ward, she assigned him to Coulson's newly created team as he was promoted to Clearance Level 7. Hill and Ward discussed the new world in the wake of the Battle of New York, which she described as what had caused the end of the world.

Maria Hill speaks with agent Phil Coulson
Hill testing Ward on his loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D. before informing him of his new assignment, much to Ward's annoyance as he believed himself to be a poor team player, although these complaints were ignored. She also oversaw the team's first mission, to investigate the Rising Tide and the Hooded Hero. During this time, both she and J. Streiten talked about their concern over Coulson's status after his recovery in Tahiti following his death at the hands of Loki and also about his lack of awareness over the true circumstances that surrounded his death, with Hill noted that he must never learn the terrible truth about what really happened to him.

Hill speaks with Doctor J. Streiten
Coulson later reported directly to her after Mike Peterson was successfully sedated in Los Angeles after a prolonged chase. When Coulson was abducted by the Centipede Project, Hill wanted constant updates on the situation of the rescue mission coordinated by Victoria Hand with the help of Coulson's Team. Hill gave a random psychological assessment to Mark Smith on his day off from working field missions. She found him unfit for assignment and instead sent him to the S.H.I.E.L.D. S.T.A.T.I.O.N..

Fall of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Attack on Nick Fury
Nick Fury orders Hill to come to Washington
Prior to the launch of the Project Insight Helicarriers, Hill was called by Nick Fury to Washington, D.C. following his discovery of suspicious information about S.H.I.E.L.D.'s true intentions with the project. Fury ordered her to come to DC within the next few hours but did not reveal his reasons for needing her. Seconds after their phone call ended, Fury was attacked by HYDRA operatives.

Hill pretends to mourn the death of Nick Fury
Fury escaped from the assassination attempt and regrouped in Steve Rogers' apartment to give him some intel. However, he was shot and seemingly killed at the hands of the Winter Soldier. In order to keep Fury alive, Hill used Tetrodotoxin B to slow his heart rate. She then took Fury to the secret S.H.I.E.L.D. Dam Facility so that he could heal with the assistance of Fine while they attempted to gather whatever information they could about the truth about what was truly going on inside S.H.I.E.L.D..

Hill is confronted by Agent Jasper Sitwell
Hill then returned to the Triskelion and met with Jasper Sitwell, telling him that she had been absent from S.H.I.E.L.D. because she was arranging Fury's funeral. Changing the subject, Sitwell showed Hill footage of Captain America and Black Widow on the run and questioned her about it. Hill simply answered that she was not at all surprised, as Rogers did tend to inspire loyalty among his allies. Sitwell replied that Alexander Pierce was moving Hill off the case and that she was to return to New York City after Fury's funeral, as Pierce felt that Hill's connections to Rogers and the Avengers put her loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D. into question.

Saving Captain America
Hill rescues her allies disguised as HYDRA
Captain America, Black Widow, and Falcon discovered HYDRA's infiltration of the organization and were captured during a battle with the Winter Soldier. Hill managed to subdue a HYDRA guard and take his uniform. She snuck onto the vehicle carrying Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson and used a Taser Rod to knock out the other guard. Hill freed them and escaped with the help of a Mouse Hole device before Brock Rumlow could execute the three of them.

Hill and Sam Wilson listen to Nick Fury
Hill brought the trio to Nick Fury's location and got medical help from Fine for an injured Romanoff, who had been shot in the shoulder during her fight with the Winter Soldier. There, Hill revealed to Romanoff, Rogers and Wilson that Fury was in fact not dead and that they had developed a way to stop Project Insight but needed the group's help. The three questioned why this had been kept a secret, and Hill explained that HYDRA needed to believe they had succeeded.

Hill and Nick Fury discuss their mission plan
Hill and Fury outlined their plan to board the Helicarriers and change the chips inside to cause the Helicarriers' weapons to target each other rather than innocent people. Rogers revealed his intentions to destroy both S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA, as he believed that although HYDRA and Alexander Pierce were the enemy, S.H.I.E.L.D. was proven to be a broken system; Hill agreed with Rogers and helped convince Fury that it was the right thing to do.

Battle at the Triskelion
Hill prepares to stop HYDRA's Project Insight
With the plan agreed on, to disable the Project Insight Helicarriers from the inside controls while also allowing Black Widow to publish all of S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA's secrets online for the world to see, Hill assisted Captain America in regaining his World War II Uniform from the Smithsonian Institution. The group then travelled back to the Triskelion to begin their plan to save millions of lives before HYDRA could complete their genocide.

Hill breaks into the Triskelion with Steve Rogers
Hill broke into the Triskelion with Rogers and Falcon and coordinated them in their attempt to disable Project Insight. While Rogers and Wilson disabled the Helicarriers, Romanoff infiltrated the main conference room to capture Alexander Pierce with the help of Nick Fury. Hill stayed in the command center, ordering and tracking the team during the mission. She took control of the Helicarriers one by one as their chips were inserted while defending herself several times from any attacking HYDRA agents.

Hill in the S.H.I.E.L.D. control room
During the battle, Hill spotted Brock Rumlow heading for the World Security Council to stop Pierce's arrest and alerted Falcon, who went to keep him away from the council. Later when Rogers became trapped onboard the third Helicarrier while fighting the Winter Soldier, he ordered Hill to make the Helicarriers fire at each other. Despite her protests that Rogers was still inside, Hill did as ordered and the Insight Helicarriers were destroyed. Rogers survived the crash, while Pierce was killed by Nick Fury. Romanoff successfully leaked all of the organization's files onto the internet, effectively destroying S.H.I.E.L.D..

Stark Industries
Hill begins working at Stark Industries
Once the battle at the Triskelion left S.H.I.E.L.D. in shambles, Hill visited the Human Resources department of Stark Industries and was interviewed for a job, taking a polygraph test. This was a move to protect herself from prison as the protection coming from Stark Industries' lawyers rather than Tony Stark, as well as to allow her to continue maintaining global security. She communicated with Nick Fury during this time, feeding him intelligence and covertly working for him.

While working for Stark Industries she was interviewed and questioned by various intelligence agencies from around the world including the CIA, the NSA, and the NRO. She was also interviewed by United States Congress, which to her were the most stressful meetings because in her view they acted more immature. Despite working for Stark, she was still constantly under high-level surveillance by multiple agencies including the FBI.

Assisting Phil Coulson
Confronted by Melinda May
Maria Hill on the phone with Pepper Potts
One night in Washington, D.C., while complaining to Pepper Potts about the hearings, Hill noticed the many poorly-concealed agents tailing her had been knocked out. Hill called for backup and was surprised to be confronted by Melinda May shortly thereafter. May revealed Phil Coulson's location and asked Hill to check on him as he had learned information about his revival. She demanded to know who was behind Project T.A.H.I.T.I., believing that it was Alexander Pierce.

Hill greets and speaks to Melinda May
Hill confessed that she asked Nick Fury before, but he only told her, "that he buried the intel when he decided not to bury Coulson." May guessed that it was a riddle she needed to solve and asked Hill if she could ask Fury directly, but Hill insisted that he had indeed been assassinated just before the Battle at the Triskelion, through May did not believe this story. Their conversation was cut short when at last the FBI agents surrounded her, at which point Hill berated them for taking more than three minutes to locate her, something she would never have tolerated in her own S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.

Attack on Providence
Hill arrives in the Providence base
Hill subsequently reported the location of Nick Fury's top-secret Providence base to the United States Air Force in the hopes that its capture could be used to prevent Phil Coulson and his team being sent to prison. Glenn Talbot arrived first, causing a stand-off between him and Coulson's Team, who had been hiding out in the base. Coulson demanded to know how Talbot found the base, at which point Hill arrived and revealed she was the one who had informed Talbot.

Hill speaks to Phil Coulson
Upon arriving at the base, Talbot questioned the team while Hill had a meeting with Coulson and tried in vain to convince him to surrender the base to Talbot and his men; telling him to hand over some small pieces of intel about S.H.I.E.L.D., which just annoyed him. Coulson refused and told her that their priority should be tracking down John Garrett and Grant Ward, who were HYDRA agents, was responsible for the murders of Eric Koenig and Victoria Hand, and had recently kidnapped Skye. Hill made her choice and helped Coulson fight off Talbot and his soldiers, before she and Coulson's team, escaped.

Confronting Grant Ward
Hill threatens Grant Ward
Hill tracked down Grant Ward who was attempting to escape with Skye and Deathlok in the Bus. Hill, onboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. Jump Jet, confronted Ward and ordered him to surrender, threatening to shoot him out of the sky. Ward then taunted her that Nick Fury should have made Natasha Romanoff his second, making it clear that he knew Phil Coulson would not allow Skye to be sacrificed. Hill continued distracting Ward long enough to allow Coulson to sneak aboard the plane and rescue Skye.

Hill says goodbye to Phil Coulson
Later that night, Coulson took rooms in a small motel; he asked Hill to set up tactical back-up for him as he prepared to attack John Garrett. Hill told him there was no S.H.I.E.L.D. anymore. Hill implored Coulson and his team to end their association with S.H.I.E.L.D. as soon as Garrett had been defeated. She gave Coulson an offer to work for Tony Stark, but Coulson declined. He asked her to say hello to Stark for him but changed his mind when he remembered that Stark still believed he was dead. Hill left without saying goodbye, also telling Melinda May that Ward was HYDRA.

Finding the Scepter
Hill learns that the Scepter is in Sokovia
Hill was contacted by Phil Coulson after he had successfully located the Scepter which was being held by Wolfgang von Strucker in Sokovia. The pair discussed the recent S.H.I.E.L.D. Civil War where Robert Gonzales attempted to take control of the Playground. Both Coulson and Hill mocked Gonzales' voting method for every decision. Coulson ordered Hill to start the Theta Protocol and send in the Avengers to capture the Scepter and arrest von Strucker.

Avengers Reassembled
Debriefing Captain America
Hill and Doctor Helen Cho greet the Avengers
Following the intel given to her by Phil Coulson, Hill sent the Avengers on the successful Attack on the HYDRA Research Base where they captured both the Scepter and Wolfgang von Strucker. With the mission complete, Hill greeted their Quinjet at Avengers Tower prepared to debrief the team about their mission's success.

Hill speaks with Captain America
As Hawkeye was being taken to be cared for by Helen Cho, Hill spoke to Captain America about Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, whom they had encountered during the battle; Hill explained their powers in detail to Rogers, switching to less complicated terms to make it clear to him. When Hill made a comment about how they had volunteered for Strucker and List's experiments, Rogers compared them to himself as he had volunteered for Abraham Erskine's experiments.

Avengers' Celebration
Hill attends Tony Stark's celebratory party
Hill was present at a celebratory party thrown by Tony Stark at the Avengers Tower. Drinking with Stark, Thor, and James Rhodes, she snidely opined that Pepper Potts and Jane Foster had intentionally missed the party, mocking the pair as they competed over who had the more impressive girlfriend by listing their accomplishments before Hill walked away with Rhodes while teasing them over their egos and how both of their respective partners could ever deal with such a pair.

Hill spends time drinking with Clint Barton
Once most of the guests had left the party, Hill sat with Clint Barton and continued drinking and played cards with Rhodes and Stark. While many of the Avengers attempted to lift Mjølnir without success; Hill herself did not attempt to lift the hammer, although she did take a chance to make fun of Steve Rogers for some comments he had made during the Attack on the HYDRA Research Base earlier that day which Black Widow had decided to tell her.

Attack on Avengers Tower
Hill witnesses the arrival of Ultron's first body
While the celebrations continued, the group was suddenly interrupted by the arrival of Ultron, an A.I. made from the bodies of several Iron Legion robots. Hill was the first to load her gun as Ultron began ranting about his desire to destroy the Avengers in order to save the world from further destruction as he viewed them as a great threat to humanity.

Hill shoots at the attacking Ultron Sentries
Despite Steve Rogers' best efforts to reason with the robot, Ultron refused to listen and instead sent in a small army of reprogrammed Iron Legion robots to attack them. Hill joined the team in a fight against Ultron's small army Ultron Sentries, firing her gun at them while the main heroes destroyed them as best they could. Eventually, Ultron's body was destroyed by Thor who launched Mjølnir at the main body, but not before one of the Sentries had managed to escape with the Scepter before it could be stopped.

Argument over Ultron
Hill recovers after Ultron's first attack
In the aftermath of the skirmish, Hill and the rest of the team were forced to make a plan to deal with the new threat. Hill and James Rhodes noted that as Ultron had proven that he could hack into the Avengers Tower's security systems, he could easily steal nuclear codes and cause global destruction. They went on to discuss who Ultron had killed, as Tony Stark to revealed J.A.R.V.I.S.' mainframe had been attacked and seemingly destroyed by Ultron.

Hiding the Avengers
Hill and Steve Rogers discuss Ultron's attacks
As the hunt for Ultron continued, Hill informed Steve Rogers of a further sighting of Ultron and his legion of Ultron Sentries who had been attacking robotics labs, weapons facilities, and jet propulsion labs. Hill confirmed that several people had been killed and Ultron was being helped by Pietro and Wanda Maximoff and had assassinated Baron Wolfgang von Strucker from within his prison cell.

Hill advises the Avengers to disappear
In the aftermath of the Duel of Johannesburg, between Iron Man and Hulk, the public blamed the massive destruction caused on the Avengers. Maria Hill called Clint Barton while he piloted the Quinjet and recommended them to find a hideout for a while, as the team was suffering from the effects of Wanda Maximoff. Barton assured her that he knew where they could go, taking them to his home where they could rest and then be greeted by Nick Fury.

Battle of Sokovia
Hill and Nick Fury commanding the Helicarrier
Nick Fury requested that Hill join him in planning support for the Avengers' battle against Ultron. Fury and Hill recruited former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents including Cameron Klein and took possession of an old Helicarrier which was repaired by Phil Coulson, as part of the Theta Protocol. When they arrived at Sokovia they found the Avengers engaged in a massive battle against the seemingly unstoppable army of Ultron Sentries.

Hill defends the Helicarrier from Ultron's army
Flying the Helicarrier in close, Hill sent out the rescue crafts to save the civilians while War Machine assisted in the battle. One of Ultron Sentries attacked the Helicarrier during the battle, but Hill and Fury fought back, with Hill firing her weapon at the attacking robot until they destroyed it before it did more harm to the ship or their crew-members. Eventually, the battle was won, thousands of civilians were saved and Ultron was destroyed forever by the Vision.

Nick Fury's Crew
New Avengers Facility
Hill and Helen Cho inside the Avengers Facility
With Ultron destroyed and the help safe again, Hill was transferred to the New Avengers Facility, coordinating all the efforts of the Avengers' newest incarnation, who was now under the joint leadership of Captain America and Black Widow. Hill worked alongside Helen Cho inside her brand new laboratory. Hill kept working closely with Nick Fury again, discussing the Sokovia Accords during the beginnings of the Clash of the Avengers, as they witnessed the Avengers falling apart due to the Accords.

Thanos' Victory
Hill and Nick Fury discussing their situation
Having spoken to Tony Stark about Vision, Hill left Stark Industries and joined Nick Fury as they realized yet another alien invasion was beginning. They drove through Atlanta, with still no clear idea of what was happening. Fury asked Hill for updates on Stark's location, after he had disappeared into a Q-Ship during his recent fight in New York City against the Black Order. She replied they had found absolutely nothing despite extensive searching around the globe.

Hill realizes something has gone terribly wrong
Interrupting this topic, Hill then informed Fury that they had just spotted several more unidentified objects which had been detected over in Wakanda, indicating that something serious was happening there. However, before they could make contact with Cameron Klein, a car in front of them suddenly swerved out of control, forcing Hill and Fury to stop in the middle of the road. Hill then went to investigate and see what could have caused the unexpected car crash.

Hill being turned into dust by the Snap
Hill and Fury were both unharmed, but when they had gone to check on the driver, there was no one inside. Suddenly, people around them began to disappear while more vehicles crashed, as Thanos had completed the Infinity Gauntlet and used it to destroy half of all life in the universe. Not knowing what was going on, Hill soon began to disintegrate as well and called to Fury for help before fading into dust, with him simply unable to do anything to save her.

The Blip
Hill attends Tony Stark's funeral
In 2023, Hill was resurrected as Bruce Banner had successfully used the Nano Gauntlet to bring back everyone who died in the Snap. In the wake of her resurrection, she was present at Tony Stark's funeral, as he sacrificed himself during the Battle of Earth to defeat Thanos. Hill stood by Thaddeus Ross to pay her respects. As Fury got in contact with the Skrulls, he asked Talos and Soren to impersonate him and Hill and replace them both on the Earth for some time.

Personality
Maria Hill is well-known in S.H.I.E.L.D. for being rather tough-minded and by the book. Her clear-headed pragmatism and reason were valued on multiple important occasions, especially during the critical situation surrounding the Avengers Initiative. She was shown to be extremely loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D. and especially to Director Nick Fury, having personally helped him several times, such as when he faked his death after being attacked by the Winter Soldier. However, Hill ultimately proved that for the greater good, she was willing to discard her loyalties to S.H.I.E.L.D. and help Captain America to destroy HYDRA, despite the fact that it would tear S.H.I.E.L.D. apart.

Since working for Stark Industries, Hill has grown close to her employer Pepper Potts and the Avengers. Though very professional when on the job, she jokes with her colleagues and is lighthearted during times of levity. However, she still remained professional and never let her guard down, not completely trusting Tony Stark, nor did he trust her. Despite both of them not trusting each other, Hill was saddened by Tony's sacrifice to defeat Thanos and attended his funeral out of respect.

Trivia
In the comics, Maria Hill served as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. before Tony Stark took over due to Nick Fury having to go into hiding regarding his illegal operation of sending in a team of superheroes (consisting of: Spider-Man, Daredevil, Wolverine, Captain America, Luke Cage, and Black Widow) on an unapproved mission in Latveria during the Secret Wars storyline.
In the deleted scenes of The Avengers, Maria Hill was asked by the World Security Council to spy on Nick Fury and report on his actions, with Hill constantly informing the Council of every incident, including Loki's control over Clint Barton, much to Fury's displeasure. The deleted scenes also featured Hill being interviewed by the Council, where she notified them that she did not support Fury or his belief in the Avengers Initiative. Following the Battle of New York, she spoke to the Council once again, where she reported on Fury's actions, prompting the Council to demote Fury and appoint Hill as the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.. However, following the end of the meeting, it is revealed that the events surrounding the Chitauri Invasion, particularly the Council's decision to detonate a nuclear explosive in New York City, prompted Hill to switch allegiance to Fury. Joss Whedon chose to remove these scenes from the final cut, making Hill loyal to Fury from the beginning and giving them a much more trustworthy relationship, while also allowing Fury to retain his position as Director.
