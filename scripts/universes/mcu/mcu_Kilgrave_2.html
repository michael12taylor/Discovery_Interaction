<html><p>However, his now highly frustrated father demanded to be allowed to rest so he could focus better and improve his work. Unwilling to accept these excuses, Kilgrave lost his temper and ordered him to step into the kitchen and turn on the blender while Boden and Levin could only watch on in horror, unable to move from their positions. Kilgrave then ordered his father to slowly lower his hand near the blades and stop millimeters away. Once his father's fingers were close enough to be cut, Kilgrave asked him again if he needed to rest and his father said no, so they continued their work.

Duel of Delaney Hall
Kilgrave reveals the truth to Jessica Jones
Using the information given to him by Luke Cage, Kilgrave was able to track Jessica Jones to Delaney Hall; taking over the microphone, Kilgrave called her out onto the stage for another confrontation. As Jones calmly walked towards him, Kilgrave attempted to force her to stop but his powers were still not strong enough and Jones continued walking. Frustrated but not yet beaten, Kilgrave quoted back what Cage had said and revealed that he had been the one who had told Cage to say it, before ordering Cage to hit her.

Kilgrave orders Luke Cage to attack Jones
Kilgrave proudly revealed how his powers had increased and he had Cage until his control the entire time, and Cage claimed that he could never forgive her for killing Reva Connors, although Jones tried to talk him down. Kilgrave claimed he had never wanted this but she had failed his test, before ordering Cage to kill her. As Cage began to beat Jones to death, Kilgrave continued to mock her, claiming all his tender moments were controlled by him. When Jones attempted to attack him, Kilgrave ordered Cage to go stop her before escaping, leaving Jones to die by the hands of the man she truly loved.

Hospital Ambush
Kilgrave hunts down Jessica Jones
Knowing that Jessica Jones defeated Luke Cage and rushed him to Metro-General Hospital, Kilgrave called her on the phone, mocking her for saving her own life and risking Cage's and expressed his new found hatred for Jones. He was insulted about his so-called evil plan, Kilgrave claimed not to be evil, just removing nuisances from his life. As Jones discovered his location, Kilgrave fled, before ordering every person in the hospital to kill her.

Power through Pain
Kilgrave considers killing Jessica Jones
Furious that he had once again failed to kill Jessica Jones as she had escaped from the Metro-General Hospital with Luke Cage, Kilgrave took out his rage on his father, who he accused of not working hard enough despite being more powerful than ever. Desiring to become as powerful as he could possibly be, Kilgrave questioned what would happen if he was injected with all the drugs, although his father warned that the most likely result would be his death.

Kilgrave and his father discuss his powers
As he considered the risks, Kilgrave asked what his father wanted the result to be and he admitted that he wanted his son to die, to which Kilgrave turned to Justin Boden and Frank Levin to show his disgust at his father's words before admitting that he would like to see his father die as well. Kilgrave thought for a moment and decided to go ahead with the injection regardless of the risks involved, he then moved onto the balcony, looking over New York City while considering that he could finally put Jones back under his power and then reject her, driving her mad and eventually to her suicide.

Kilgrave temporarily turning purple
Once the drug was ready, Kilgrave braced himself and allowed his father to inject him in the back of the neck with the mixture created from Hope Shlottman's child. The injection caused him incredible pain, making him scream out as his skin and veins briefly turned purple while everyone in the room could only watch in horror. The experiment was a success, but in a fit of rage, Kilgrave ordered Boden and Levin to cut off his father's arms and destroy them in a blender before killing themselves with poison while he began making a plan to use his new power to finally kill Jones.

Final Showdown
Kilgrave threatens Trish Walker
Kilgrave invited Jessica Jones to meet him at the Hudson Ferry Terminal for their final confrontation. She arrived with her hood covering her face and looking down, Kilgrave mocked Jones for not having the courage to look him in the eye and unveiled the team of New York City Police Department officers under his control. However, the woman was then revealed to be Trish Walker, annoying Kilgrave until he spotted the real Jones and ordered the officers to shoot her.

Kilgrave orders Jessica Jones to stop
As Kilgrave made his way to the Goldfish, Jones managed to catch up with him; however, he had already prepared a group of innocent people to block her path. To stop Jones, Kilgrave ordered the people to kill each other, forcing Jones and Walker to try to protect them. As Jones continued to walk towards him, Kilgrave roared with all this might, causing his skin and veins to briefly turn purple again as he ordered everyone to stop, which they did, including Jones. Kilgrave briefly believed that Jones was faking but she claimed that she wanted him to stop the people hurting each other.

Kilgrave vows to enslave Trish Walker
Kilgrave claimed that Jones could have never loved him as she had never loved anyone except Walker. To mock Jones, Kilgrave ordered Walker to come over to him and claimed that he had chosen the wrong sister to love, promising he would rape her continually for the rest of her life and make her his slave while she died inside. Kilgrave promised that if either of them ever saw Jones again, he would make Walker cut her own throat. He then forced Walker to kiss him passionately while he stared at Jones.

Kilgrave is tricked by Jessica Jones
Seeing that she had still not moved from her spot and had made no effort to save Walker from him, Kilgrave became convinced that his powers had indeed allowed him to control Jones once again. Delighted, Kilgrave approached her and promised Jones that after a while of being together, she would love him as he loved her. To test his theory, Kilgrave ordered her to smile, which she obeyed instantly.

Kilgrave's neck is broken by Jessica Jones
Overcome with joy at the prospect of having Jones back, Kilgrave ordered her to tell him she loved him. Glancing over his shoulder to Walker, Jones said the words as instructed. However, as he stood staring at her, Jones then grabbed Kilgrave's face and lifted him off the ground with one arm. As Kilgrave looked down in confusion and horror, Jones mockingly told him to smile before breaking his neck, killing him instantly and dropping his body to the ground, freeing all those around the docks from his mind control.

Legacy
Haunting Jessica Jones
Kilgrave is hallucinated by Jessica Jones
Despite being gone for good, Kilgrave continued to have a lasting impact on Jessica Jones' mental health, who feared she may be heading down a murderous path upon killing him. After accidentally killing Dale Holiday, Jones had then begun to hallucinate, seeing Kilgrave, who taunted her and pressured her over it, which got progressively more severe over a day as Kilgrave's hallucination praised Jones over becoming a murderer.

Kilgrave taunts Jessica Jones in her head
As Jones continued her investigation to attempt to aid her mother, Kilgrave's image would follow her, offering advice and commenting on how Jones had now killed three people following the deaths of himself, Reva Connors and now Holiday. Despite Jones trying her best to ignore him, Kilgrave's smiling image continued to haunt her, with Malcolm Ducasse becoming concerned over what was distracting Jones and causing her distress. The hallucinations only stopped when Jones spared the life of Karl Malus and declared to herself she wouldn't go down that killer path any longer.

Over a year later, in 2018, Jones decided to retire from her position as head of Alias Investigations and leave for Mexico after the arrest of her sister, Trish Walker. Just before grabbing her train station ticket, however, she heard Kilgrave in her head a final time, taunting her and congratulating her for giving up, insisting that it was someone else's job. This prompted Jones to change her mind about leaving, giving her the confidence and defiance she needs to be able to control the lasting effects of Kilgrave and the rest of her inner demons.

Personality
Kilgrave lacked any form of moral compass or conscience, showing traits of sociopathy. Unlike Wilson Fisk or Cornell Stokes, who relied on brute force to get what they wanted, Kilgrave embraced a more psychological approach when enforcing his will on others. If someone annoyed him, he would frequently go out of his way to order them to do something vicious to themselves. An example of this was when he ordered a newspaper salesman to throw his hot coffee over his face simply for telling him to stop loitering. This was only a mild example; he had been known to order people to remain motionless for hours on end or even to commit suicide in the most brutal of ways. He also had little, if any, self-control, with a tendency to overreact to even the slightest insult. He repeatedly raped female thralls such as Jessica Jones and Hope Shlottman, impregnating the latter, and was apparently too divorced from human morality to realize it was rape, considering he took them out for fine dining and hotels.

Before he met Jones, Kilgrave was used to getting everything he wanted, essentially a spoiled child in an adult body. However, when Jones managed to escape his influence, Kilgrave became obsessed with Jones; stalking her and trying everything in his power to get at her with the ultimate goal of trying to make her his. Under this delusion of love, Kilgrave went out of his way to prove he was a changed man worthy of love, even buying Jones’ childhood home without brainwashing the current owner to do as he bid. To further this goal, Kilgrave attempted to destroy anyone even remotely close to Jones. Hope Shlottman and her family were mere toys for Kilgrave and his attempts to woo Jones. He turned Jones' neighbor Malcolm Ducasse into a drug addict so he could use him to get pictures of her. This would have also happened to Trish Walker, when he was just about to escape wanted the ultimate act of revenge against Jones by taking one of the only people she ever loved and turning into his plaything; in Jones' mind he would be raping her, whilst Walker was slowly dying in her own mind.

However, when forced to see the experiments that created him, Kilgrave showed genuine sadness and discomfort, covering his ears and assuming the fetal position in order to hide from the video being shown. However, he was also shown to have enough strong will to endure ten hours of surgery while awake, using an epidural instead, since putting him unconscious with surgical anesthesia, such as propofol or sufentanil would shut down different bodily functions, removing his control over others. He then watched as the man he enthralled, David Kurata, performed the surgery to give him Jack Denton's kidney, the latter of whom he also enthralled.

Ironically, despite being child-like himself, Kilgrave immensely disliked children, believing they should be "seen and not heard, or better still not seen and not heard". Without batting an eyelid, he put the children of a family into a closet and told them to be quiet, not caring that the family's daughter needed the toilet. He also told a man he controlled to become his chauffeur to leave his child on the side of the street. He also saw no regret in using the fetus of his aborted child with Shlottman in order for his father to research ways to expand his powers to greater levels. 

One of his most defining traits was his complete refusal to take responsibility for any of his actions, often twisting events and finding reasons to make it sound like others were to blame or that his victims deserved the horrible fate he gave them. He went so far as to say Jones didn't love him because she was incapable of loving another person, not even considering the possibility that it was because he turned her into his personal mind-slave. 

Kilgrave never once considered using his powers for genuine good. He was utterly self-obsessed about his own needs alone and had no feelings for another human being, nor did he show remorse for any of his actions. However, he was intrigued by Jessica’s desire to help people upon first meeting her and even asked her “superhero name”. To his surprise, he found rescuing a hostage family from the father rewarding having never experienced gratitude that was at least genuine in his life before and momentarily considered the idea that he could be a hero. Unfortunately, Kilgrave’s lack of morality and narcissism prevented him from judging between right and wrong due to thinking it was acceptable to make the father kill himself because of his insanity and never having been a “productive member of society”.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Mind Control: Kilgrave had the ability to control another person's mind through literal verbal commands and make them completely obedient to him, thanks to a virus that he emits through microparticles in the air. His power was revealed to be a side-effect of the viral treatment used to cure his childhood degenerative disease. His ability is always active as he cannot stop his body from producing the virus and anyone within his immediate proximity is affected but don't realize it until he issues a command. The nature of Kilgrave's viral mind control required him to be physically present for his commands to have an immediate effect. Speaking over a phone or through a physical barrier like a sealed room did not enthrall his victim. Once his thrall left his vicinity Kilgrave's power had a time limit of ten to twelve hours before the victim began to regain his or her own will unless he reestablished control before the time limit was up. Until the time limit was up, the victims would continue to follow Kilgrave's commands unless he interrupted them and gave them a different order to follow. He controlled Hope Shlottman for several weeks and Jessica Jones for 8 months. Kilgrave's ability could compel behavior as well as actions. By saying "you'd like to invite me in" and "I'm going to be your guest here indefinitely, You'll be delighted", he enthralled a man and his wife not only to invite him into their home, totally ignoring the fact that he was a stranger who just locked their children in a closet but treat him kindly as a guest, serving him dinner with smiles on their faces. His control over others' behavior seemed to allow him to control their emotions or at least emulate an emotion on command, such as making a little girl he sent as a messenger to Jessica angrily insult her for leaving Kilgrave for dead. He also did this to Luke Cage, making him angrily state that he could never forgive Jones for killing Reva Connors, though he did later hesitate while following Kilgrave's orders to kill Jones and his anger faded into sadness when asking Jessica to shoot him. While Kilgrave could command physical actions and compel behavior he was unable to erase or alter memories which more often than not led to him compelling murder or suicide to keep his existence a secret. His abilities invade people's thoughts and deadens their will, Jessica describes it as "prying fungus from a window, I couldn't think". This causes the victim to either seemingly not feel emotions while following his orders or in cases when a victim is told to kill or harm themselves or others, show visible fear and confusion, such as Albert Thompson, who was panicked when Kilgrave enthralled him to put his hand near the blades inside a running blender. When under Kilgrave's control people would do anything he commanded to the best of their ability, even working non-stop to the point of passing out and forgoing using the bathroom or eating in favor of following his commands. His thralls in the hospital, when commanded to find and kill Jessica, were urgently looking for her and even worked together to expose her, as one suspicious nurse alerted the others to Jones when she was disguised. His thralls seemed overwhelmed with anxiety and panic when unable to carry out Kilgrave's wishes, feeling they "have to" do as he instructs. Hope Shlottman flew into a hysterical frenzy when Jessica removed her from the bed Kilgrave told her to stay in and Trish Walker was having an emotional breakdown from stress when she was unable to put a bullet in her skull as Kilgrave told her to, desperately repeating "I have to put a bullet in my head" while pressing a fired round into her temple. Kilgrave's thralls must fulfill his words specifically, which can leave them open to interpretation. When he told Trish Walker to put a bullet in her skull, and therefore her head, Jessica Jones found a loophole in that command and placed a bullet inside Trish's mouth, thereby putting a bullet in her head, allowing her to satisfy Kilgrave's command and stop. Kilgrave's thralls remain under his control when he is sleeping or unconscious but certain anesthetics such as propofol or sufentanil shut down the bodily functions necessary to keep others under his control. Kilgrave was even willing to use an epidural during surgery to replace his kidneys in order to retain his control of the surgeon performing the procedure. If a person suffered a significantly traumatic event while under Kilgrave's control it was possible for them to break free of it and become immune to the virus and its mind control effect, as when Jessica Jones murdered Reeva Connors and was so traumatized that from that moment on she was immune to Kilgrave. Initially, Kilgrave could only control the people in his immediate vicinity who "share the same air with him", according to Jessica, but after Albert Thompson performed more experiments on him, Kilgrave's power expanded to a distance of over a hundred yards and a time limit of 16 hours, then up to 24. Ultimately these enhancements allowed Kilgrave to enthrall the entirety of Metro-General Hospital over the PA system, presumably producing enough of his virus to fill the entire building and place everyone within it under his control. Kilgrave could only determine if someone was under his thrall by observing them obeying his commands, this allowed Jessica to get close enough to kill him by acting like she was under his control.

Trivia
In the comics, Zebediah Killgrave (with two Ls) was a spy from Yugoslavia who was exposed to chemicals during a mission of industrial espionage. The accident changed his skin purple, granting him the name of Purple Man, and allowing him to control people's minds through their pheromones. He became a regular foe of Daredevil, and the arch-nemesis of Jessica Jones.
Kilgrave's actions towards Jessica Jones in the television show differ from that of the comics. While Kilgrave did indeed keep Jones a prisoner for months, he never used her for sexual means as he did in the show, mainly using her as an enforcer.
Kilgrave tends to dress using purple suits and clothing, alluding further to his codename in the comics. Though in the series he is never referred to by that name.
When injected with the drug to enhance his powers and then later, when shouting at a large crowd of people to stop what they were doing at the Hudson Ferry Terminal, Kilgrave's veins briefly turned purple, a nod to his codename in the comics.
Behind the Scenes
Peter Wallack and Ben Rezendes were stunt doubles for David Tennant in the role of Kilgrave.
