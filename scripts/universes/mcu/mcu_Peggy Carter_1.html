Dr. Margaret Elizabeth "Peggy" Carter, Ph.D., was one of the most prominent agents of the Strategic Scientific Reserve during and after World War II and one of the founders of S.H.I.E.L.D.. Originally a code-breaker working at Bletchley Park, she joined the Special Operations Executive following her brother's death. Carter later joined the SSR, formed to fight HYDRA. On the mission in Germany, she saved Abraham Erskine from Johann Schmidt. The success of her mission enabled the SSR to start Project Rebirth and develop their Super Soldier Serum to make the army of Super Soldiers. During the project, she had befriended Steve Rogers, one of the project's candidates.

In 1943, after the abrupt end of Project Rebirth and Rogers' transformation into the only Super Soldier, Carter assisted him in becoming the world's first superhero, eventually falling in love with him. After Rogers' disappearance in 1945, she continued the SSR's fight against HYDRA, capturing the last high-ranking HYDRA officer Werner Reinhardt, and continuing her service in the SSR once the War ended.

As an agent of the SSR, Carter helped former colleague Howard Stark clear his name when he was accused of being a traitor, and later traveled to Los Angeles where she clashed with Whitney Frost over the extra-dimensional Zero Matter. She helped Stark found the new peacekeeping organization, the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division, better known by its acronym S.H.I.E.L.D.. Carter eventually married an Allied soldier and became a mother of two children, though she would continue her service in S.H.I.E.L.D. during the turbulent years of the Cold War, becoming the agency's director by 1970.

By the beginning of the 21st century, Carter retired and saw her great-niece, Sharon Carter, follow in her footsteps. During her retirement, a young Rogers was pulled from the ice and found to be alive, but by this time she had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and struggled to recognize him. She died peacefully in her sleep in 2016.

After discovering a method to travel through time in 2023, Rogers returned to the 1940s, creating an alternate timeline where he married Carter and grew old with her.

Biography
Early Life
Childhood
Margaret "Peggy" Carter was born to Harrison and Amanda Carter on Wednesday, April 9, 1921, in Hampstead, England. She received her education from St Martin-In-The-Fields High School for Girls and at some point gained a PHD from Trinity College, Cambridge.

Peggy Carter plays with her older brother
Throughout her childhood, Carter almost always held a sense of adventure. She was particularly close to her older brother, Michael, whom she admired. Her mother often found Peggy's sense of adventure frightening and advised her to act more like a traditional lady. Once, Carter was reprimanded by her school's headmaster for breaking into his home and attempting to steal his wife's underwear and his most expensive bottle of brandy. The incident made Carter a hero to her fellow students.

World War II
The Codebreaker
Carter working at Bletchley Park
By 1939, Carter was a member of the British Royal Military, engaging in more simplistic office work that was expected of women of that time. By 1940 she was working as a codebreaker in Bletchley Park. During this time, Carter became engaged to Fred Wells, a man who worked in her department. Her priorities were called into question when Mr. Edwards informed her that she had been recommended for the Special Operations Executive. Believing that a woman should not fight, Carter turned down the offer.

Carter and her brother discuss Fred Wells
Carter introduced her fiancé to her brother Michael at their engagement party. To her disappointment, she discovered that Michael believed Wells was not good enough for her and that his sister had the potential for greater things. He revealed that he was the one who had recommended Peggy to be a field agent. The pair discussed if this wedding was truly what she wanted, with Michael telling her that as it was not yet her wedding day, she still had time to change her mind. In spite of his assurances that she was meant to be a fighter, Peggy refused to listen and stormed away.

Carter learns of her brother's death
Carter continued to focus on her upcoming wedding, having her mother help her try on her wedding dress. The preparations were tragically cut short when the family were informed that Michael had been killed fighting in World War II. His death greatly saddened Carter, who realized she had lost the only person who truly understood who she was. The loss prompted her to reverse her earlier decision and pursue the field agent position, but as a result, the marriage was called off. Carter eventually joined the British counter-intelligence and security agency MI5.

Joining the Strategic Scientific Reserve
As an MI5 operative, Carter was loaned out to the Strategic Scientific Reserve where she became an advisor. In November 1940, she infiltrated Castle Kaufmann, the headquarters of the Schutzstaffel general Johann Schmidt who also was a leader of HYDRA. Disguised as the maid, she freed the captured scientist Abraham Erskine, the creator of the Super Soldier Serum, and escaped the castle. Soon, Carter was assigned as a liaison from the British government under Chester Phillips's orders to help the Americans combat the Nazis. In the winter of 1942, Carter spent time in the sewers of New York City. Carter also spent time in the Soviet Union, learning local dialect which kept her from freezing to death.

Training Rebirth Candidates
Agent Peggy Carter during World War II
In June 1943, Carter was assigned to Chester Phillips' training base Camp Lehigh where she met the candidates for Project Rebirth. Carter called for the recruits for attention and introduced herself as the new supervisor from this particular division. When Gilmore Hodge mocked her English accent, Carter listened to his questions of joining the United States Army.

Carter personally confronts Gilmore Hodge
Carter then asked Hodge's name and told him to step forward for their confrontation. As Carter told Hodge to put his right feet forward, she was hit on by Hodge, being as a person who would like some moves he'll know she'll like. Being offended by his professionalism, Carter promptly punched him across the jaw, much to Colonel Chester Phillips' approval. Once Phillips arrived and gave a speech to the cadets, taking an instant dislike for Steve Rogers as he believed that soldiers should be better in their operations.

Carter watches on for Steve Rogers' training
As Rogers trained hard in his attempts to prove himself to be a worthy soldier with the United States Army, but struggled on much of the physical training, managing to get tangled with barbed wire fell that Private Hodge had dropped on Rogers which he would be forced to crawl through all of the mud. Sergeant Michael Duffy noticed this predicament which had garnered Carter's attention on the soldiers training.

Carter is impressed by Steve Rogers' skill
While Carter kept overseeing potential candidates' training for Project Rebirth, she continued to watch out for the division on their running exercise. While out on their run under the orders of Sergeant Michael Duffy, Rogers and the other cadets were offered a ride home if they successfully took down a flag from the top of a pole, Carter watched on until Rogers had took down the pole and captured the flag, much to her smile for his thought.

Carter and Steve Rogers during his training
As Carter was impressed by Rogers' approached to the situation with more thought and, rather than attempting to climb up the flagpole, she smiled on the prospect of Rogers giving the flag to Duffy and climbed on to the Jeep. With that, and Rogers being the first cadet in the camp's history to successfully take the flag, Carter looked back at him as an assertion of his cleverness and took him back into Camp Lehigh, much to the other privates who were annoyed.

Carter ordered the cadets to do their exercises
In a push up exercise with the whole division, Carter supervised them into shape, telling them to move faster and how her grandmother had more life in her before passing. While Carter ordered the soldiers to do jumping jacks, she was interrupted by Phillips' grenade, not knowing it was a dud and attempted to do something about it. Much to Phillips surprise, Rogers jumped over the grenade in order to protect his fellow soldiers from the blast and told everyone to get back.

Carter notices Steve Rogers' act of bravery
Looking at Rogers' attempt to protect others from the explosive, Carter was surprised by the grenade to be fake, leading to her smiling at Rogers for act of bravery he committed. Once Rogers realized it was a fake grenade and hadn't exploded, he then asked Carter if it was test. While from an observant feet away, Phillips had finally relented to Abraham Erskine, much to his annoyance and Erskine's satisfaction.

Project Rebirth
Carter escorts Steve Rogers to Project Rebirth
When Steve Rogers was selected as the candidate, Carter and him were driven together to Project Rebirth. On the way, Rogers pointed out many of the locations in New York City where he had been beaten up. As Rogers and Carter talked about being picked on and ignored for something they could not change, Carter was charmed by his determination and humility, as well as his desire to one day dance with "the right partner."

Carter and Steve Rogers arrive at the facility
Once they arrived at the Facility under the antique shop, Carter escorted Rogers where the Strategic Scientific Reserve where awaiting their arrival in order to begin the procedure as was planned. Carter met an elderly woman who was standing behind the shop desk, giving her their secret code which granted them access into the secret facility, which was being hidden behind a large bookcase to avoid suspicion from members of the general public.

Carter watches Steve Rogers' preparation
As soon as they stepped inside the main room, Carter observed all of the scientists turning and looking at Rogers, awaiting the beginning of the experiment, before Doctor Abraham Erskine greeted Rogers. While Rogers was instructed to remove his shirt, shoes and hat ready for them to begin their experiment, Howard Stark prepped the machinery for the experiment to work, as Carter looked back on Rogers for his well being.

Carter watches Steve Rogers' experiment
Once Rogers was strapped into the Vita-Ray Chamber, Erskine gave a short speech to Phillips and all the other people watching about exactly how Project Rebirth would work and what their procedure entailed, promising this would be the first step towards bring them to peace during World War II. Carter observed Rogers being injected with to the Super Soldier Serum treatment with group of people in a room.

Carter tells Dr. Erskine to shut the machine off
Erskine then ordered Stark to activate the machine which lifted Rogers before dosing him with Vita Radiation. Carter witnessed how Rogers was injected with the Super Soldier Serum at Project Rebirth. During the procedure, Rogers began to scream in pain; Carter ordered Abraham Erskine and Howard Stark to stop the procedure, but Rogers insisted he could finish the procedure. Eventually, the experiment was complete and Rogers finally emerged from their experiment with a greatly enhanced physique.

Carter looks at Steve Rogers' transformation
Rogers was successfully transformed, growing over a foot in height and gaining incredible muscle mass. Carter was the first to greet Rogers as he stepped out of the Vita-Ray Chamber, asking how he felt, to which the awestruck Rogers could only comment that he felt taller. While Carter gave Rogers a t-shirt to cover himself up, all the other scientists and generals then came down to congratulate the team.

Assassination of Abraham Erskine
Carter begins to furiously attack Heinz Kruger
As the celebrations continued, one of the guests, Heinz Kruger, detonated a bomb, destroying much of the lab. Kruger then shot and killed Abraham Erskine before making his escape. Furious at the thief, Carter began to fire with gun was able to shoot him in the arm.

Carter quickly aims and shoot at Heinz Kruger
Carter followed the assassin into the streets of Brooklyn and fired several rounds into the car Kruger was using to escape. Carter managed to shoot the driver, but Kruger turned the car around and drove straight at her. Carter was saved by Steve Rogers, who pushed her out the way, although Carter insisted she could have stopped him. Rogers gave chase and successfully caught the assassin, but was unable to stop Kruger from killing himself.

Further Testing
Carter talks to Steve Rogers about the trial
With Dr. Abraham Erskine now deceased, any hope of reproducing the Super Soldier Serum was seemingly lost. With blood samples being taken from Steve Rogers in hopes to replicate the formula, Carter told him that any sample could be lost and would take years to replicate. As Rogers told her that Erskine deserved better, Carter noted that he'll be proud that his work lied upon him.

Carter talks to Chester Phillips about HYDRA
Finding Howard Stark still working on the Fieser Dorsch, Carter explained that HYDRA was the Nazi deep science division that was led by Johann Schmidt. As Colonel Chester Phillips had noted that HYDRA has bigger ambitions and that the Strategic Scientific Reserve had been retasked, Carter tried to ask what Phillips was doing but he declined her assists and told her to pack her bag to fly over to London as well as Rogers. Carter then listened on as Rogers tried to convince Phillips to allow him to serve, but Phillips refused. Carter then witnessed Senator Brandt offering Rogers a chance to serve his country.

Reunion with Captain America
Carter joins to sit with Steve Rogers in Italy
Chester Phillips was given a new assignment to take the Strategic Scientific Reserve to Europe to take the fight directly to HYDRA, and made Carter and Howard Stark a part of his staff. In November 1943, Carter met Steve Rogers again, though at this time he was employed by the United States Government to perform as the United States Army mascot, "Captain America".

Carter tells Steve Rogers about the war
Carter who tried to persuade him that he was meant for more than what he was doing, reminding him of the reasons why Abraham Erskine had selected him, commenting on how much Rogers sounded like Senator Brandt when he attempted to defend his recent work. During their conversation, Rogers learned that his friend Bucky Barnes as well as the whole 107th Infantry Regiment had been captured by HYDRA and Phillips was not planning a rescue mission.

Carter hears about the news of 107th Infantry
Running across the camp with Rogers, Carter then went immediately confront Colonel Phillips tent who teased Rogers over his Captain America character. As Rogers begged Phillips to inform him if Barnes was alive or dead, with Phillips explaining they believed he was gone, Carter looked upon Rogers as he began to plan on leaving the base camp and left the tent. Carter then stole weapons and some equipment, including Captain America's Shield, in an attempt to drive to the HYDRA base and find Barnes.

Carter agrees to help with Steve Rogers
While walking out the camp, Carter asked what Rogers was planning to travel, to which he'll do anything. Carter was then asked by Rogers what she meant when she claimed to believe he was meant for more than children's shows, which she heavily believed on her previous statement. Seeing his determination, Carter convinced Rogers to let her to aid him. With the help of Stark, Carter convinced him to use the plane from Stark Industries to help Rogers on his mission.

Carter is flown into Austria by Howard Stark
Once Stark agreed to help Rogers get to his destination at the secret HYDRA base in Austria where war prisoners were held, Carter and Rogers were onboard as they flew to the destination; along the way, Carter gave Rogers a radio to call her should he need extraction. During the journey, Carter had an awkward conversation with Rogers who mistakenly thought she had begun a relationship with Stark. The plane was soon fired upon by enemy guns, so Rogers leaped from the plane while Stark flew Carter to safety.

Liberation of Allied Prisoners of War
Carter talks to Colonel Chester Phillips
After a few days, Steve Rogers still hasn't returned, leading Chester Phillips to pronounce him as killed in action, Carter walked into his tent while Phillips gave his report, she told him that the last surveillance flight is back with no sign of activity. When Phillips told her that she was neither rich or a weapons contractor like Howard Stark, Carter told she held no regrets and neither did Rogers.

Carter witnesses Steve Rogers' surprise arrival
With Phillips not caring about her opinion and accused her for having Rogers and other soldiers killed, Carter told Phillips that she had faith in him. Before he could punish Carter for her part in Rogers' death, Rogers returned to the base with over four hundred rescued soldiers. Carter teased him for arriving late, and Rogers showed her that his radio had been damaged in the fighting. Bucky Barnes then called for all the people to acknowledge that Captain America was a hero and every soldier cheered and applauded for the man who had saved the prisoners from the clutches of HYDRA and Red Skull.

Working with Captain America
Carter is debriefed along with Steve Rogers
Carter was present at the Strategic Scientific Reserve's headquarters in London, along with Chester Phillips and the newly-promoted Steve Rogers. They briefed on what he had learned during his raid on the HYDRA Facility, including the locations of other HYDRA bases across Europe which he had seen on Arnim Zola's map. In a meeting, they discussed the best way to take down HYDRA bases scattered across Nazi-occupied Europe.

Carter gives out orders for Steve Rogers
Carter later approached Rogers in a pub while he was putting together a new team for his next missions, donning a stunning red dress. Carter informed Rogers that Howard Stark had some equipment he wanted Rogers to try in the morning. Although Bucky Barnes tried to ask Carter for a dance, Carter looked only into Rogers' eyes and stated that once the war was over, she intends to go dancing with "the right partner." Carter then told Rogers that Howard Stark needed to see him in the morning and left. 

Carter passively argues with Steve Rogers
The next morning, Carter became furious at Rogers after catching him being kissed by Phillips' secretary Lorraine. Although Rogers had still desperately tried to dismiss the situation, Carter proceeded to berate him by claiming that he had always wanted to join the United States Armed Forces and had ended up just like any other soldier. Rogers then accused Carter of having a relationship with Stark, much to her frustration of not understanding women.

Carter begins to shoot at Steve Rogers' shield
When Carter came to collect Rogers later, she found him trying out the new shield that Stark had created for him; resulting into him taking it due to his instant liking to the shield as he then enthusiastically showed it off to Carter. Without any warning, Carter was quickly enacting on her earlier jealousy and picked up a gun and shot at Rogers, declaring that the shield works. Carter left leaving Rogers and Stark shocked and impressed with ruthlessness.  

Carter watches a film reel with Chester Phillips
A few months into the war, her anger with Rogers eventually subsided while watching him on a film reel documenting one of his missions; in the footage she saw he had placed a newspaper cutout of her face inside the lid of his compass, which left her quite touched. Carter eventually received word that Bucky Barnes had been killed on a mission to capture Arnim Zola. Knowing that Rogers would be devastated by the loss of his closest friend, Carter went to find him.

Carter visits Steve Rogers in a bar by himself
Carter found Rogers sitting alone in the ruins of a bar drinking, being told that due to his cellular regeneration, he can't get drunk. After Carter told about the side effects of his metabolism, Carter tried to comfort him, reminding him that Barnes' death was not his fault. Once Rogers asked Carter if she read the report, she confirmed that she did, much to Rogers disbelief on those odds. Carter told Rogers that he did everything he could and Barnes must have believed that their mission was worth his sacrifice.

Carter comforts Steve Rogers on his grief
Although Rogers insisted that Barnes' death during the Capture of Arnim Zola was his own fault, Carter told him that Barnes knew that their mission to bring an end to World War II was worth giving his life for. As Rogers then said that he would not stop until they had finally defeated HYDRA, while also vowing that he would personally either capture or kill the Red Skull himself to avenge Barnes' sacrifice, Carter reminded him that he would not be alone.

Losing Steve Rogers
Carter is debriefed on the upcoming mission
Following the interrogation of Arnim Zola, it was learned that HYDRA was planning an attack on the United States of America. Carter attended a briefing run by Colonel Chester Phillips and learned about Red Skull's plans with his Tesseract technology while they discussed their plan to bring an end to HYDRA and Red Skull himself. Along with Howard Stark and the remaining members of the Howling Commandos, crafted a plan in which Steve Rogers break through their defenses.

Once Rogers attacked HYDRA's last base of operations, allowing himself to be captured in order to distract Red Skull and allowed the United States Army time to attack the base. While Phillips had the called to enter in the base, Carter followed along with the assault force, as the HYDRA soldiers began to fire with their Assault Weapons. While the many soldiers were killed one by one with each fire power, Carter managed survive and broke into HYDRA's base of operation with Phillips killing one of them upfront. Now inside the base, Carter attempted to find where Rogers was located and found him following Red Skull.

Carter abruptly saves Captain America's life
Noticing Rogers being pinned down by a HYDRA soldier with his flamethrowers, Carter ran up behind the soldier and fired at the soldier's fuel tank, killing him instantly as is pack was on fire. Rogers then ran straight up to Carter and reminded her of what she had said to him following the Liberation of Allied Prisoners of War by saying she was late. Carter reminded Rogers to focus on capturing Schmidt and watched Rogers retake his shield and then continued his chase.

Carter and Captain America share a kiss
Schmidt managed to get to his plane and Rogers gave chase; seeing that he had no chance of catching up, Carter and Phillips stole Johann Schmidt's Coupe and gave Rogers a lift. Just as Rogers got inside the car, they raced after the plane, with Phillips also using the car's boosters to bring them alongside the plane's wing. Just before Rogers jumped aboard the plane, Carter had shared their first and last kiss and told him to go get Schmidt, before Phillips jokingly insisted that he would not be kissing Rogers as well. 

Carter watches Steve Rogers fly away
As they neared the plane and Rogers prepared to jump on board, with little time to spare as they reached the end of the runway, Phillips was able to stop the car from plunging off a cliff edge while Rogers leaped onto the wheel and flew away with the plane. As the car had stopped and Phillips had to take a breath, Carter then looked up and watched as the plane flew away with Rogers on board, hoping to succeed on his mission.

Carter finally gets a call from Captain America
After the base is finally taken, Carter eventually received Rogers' transmission from the Valkyrie; he reported that Schmidt is dead, but the plane was damaged and could still kill countless innocents should it crash. After Rogers decided to crash the plane into the North Atlantic Sea, Carter begged for him to reconsider, knowing that this would result in his death, but Rogers claimed there was not enough time.

Carter cries over the audio of Steve Rogers
As the plane made its final descent, Carter and Rogers spoke to each other as if Rogers was not going to crash, arranging a date to finally go dancing, setting up how the date will go and where she promised to teach him how to dance. When the ship finally crashed, all communications with the plane were then lost, and all Carter could do was to mournfully cry for Rogers' death.

Capturing the Obelisk
Carter with the Howling Commandos
Later that year, Carter led a Strategic Scientific Reserve team that included Jim Morita and Dum Dum Dugan into the last HYDRA base, commanded by Werner Reinhardt. After arresting him, she had everything in the base confiscated and labelled. The label 0-8-4 was placed on an alien artifact in Reinhardt's possession that was shaped like an Obelisk. Carter discussed with Dugan that, with the war ending, a peace time organization was needed to protect the innocent from dangerous technologies and to supervise people like Howard Stark.

End of the War
Carter looks at Steve Rogers' file after the war
In May 1945, Nazi Germany surrendered. With the war now won, the SSR base in London was disbanding and Carter was there to help with the filing. Chester Phillips came over to her while she was moving boxes and handed her a single folder, containing Steve Rogers' file, which listed him as "inactive". She opened it and found a picture of Rogers prior to his transformation, and fawned over it affectionately. She kept the photo with her for many years after the war to remind her of the man she loved and lost.

No Deal for the Devil
Carter interrogates Werner Reinhardt
After his capture, Werner Reinhardt was moved to the United States of America and taken to the secret prison known as the Rat. Seeking to find out more information, Carter visited the Rat to interrogate him. They talked about the pen that she had left in his cell to find out what he would do with it. As many former Nazi scientists were already recruited by the United States Government, Reinhardt expressed the wish to be recruited as well, as he considered himself far more valuable than those who would make parlor tricks by sending rockets into space.

Carter gives Werner Reinhardt a life sentence
Carter then mentioned his many war crimes, but he offered to help her understand the items the Strategic Scientific Reserve has confiscated from his last commanding post. He told her about the myth about the "stars" and revealed that the artifacts were of extraterrestrial origin. The disdain that Carter had for Reinhardt outweighed her curiosity about the "blue angels" he described, so she sentenced him to a life term in the Rat, promising him that as long as she had a say, he would never be freed as long as she was alive.

Post-War Activities
Howard Stark's Problem
Carter in her room, preparing for work
Following the end of World War II, Carter found herself still working for the Strategic Scientific Reserve under the cover of working for a phone company. Having few friends in New York City, she lived together with her friend Colleen O'Brien. 

Carter heading to work at the SSR
Despite her work during the war, many of the men at the office still viewed her as nothing more than Captain America's "liaison". At one meeting, agents discussed Howard Stark being accused of selling his weapons to enemies of the United States of America, and though Carter tried to defend Stark based on their past relationship, the other agents rebuffed her. When Ray Krzeminski insulted her, Daniel Sousa came to her defense; Carter thanked him but told him she did not need his help. 

Carter says goodbye to Howard Stark
Later at the L&L Automat, Carter found a note that told her to go into the back alley, where Carter met with Stark and his butler, Edwin Jarvis. In the car, Stark told Carter he was being framed, claiming that someone had stolen his inventions that he considered to be too dangerous for anyone to possess, while he was vacationing in Monaco. He told her that he ran because he knew that the SSR would consider him guilty. Stark asked Carter to help him clear his name and find the true criminals behind the theft. As he departed for Europe to track down some of the stolen items, Stark told her to find a document with the formula of one of his inventions, molecular Nitramene, before it could be sold on the black market.

Nitramene
Carter covers for Howard Stark
In searching for the stolen weapons, Carter balanced actively investigating the theft while avoiding the Strategic Scientific Reserve scrutiny and other agents looking for the same clues without similar motivations concerning Howard Stark. She even fabricated some stories, such as Stark attempting to kiss her during V-E Day and throwing him to the River Thames, where he had to be rescued because he did not know how to swim. With this story, Carter made Daniel Sousa not follow a correct lead about Stark escaping by boat.

Carter searches for Spider Raymond
Carter, disguising herself with a wig and sparkling evening dress, went to a known fence, Spider Raymond, paid to sell the Nitramene formula. Carter successfully made her way into Raymond's office, where she encountered him and used her ability to seduce men easily to try and obtain the the Nitramene. However, Raymond forcefully kissed Carter, causing him to go unconcious, due to the Sweet Dreams Lipstick she was wearing. Ruining her plan, Carter started looking for the Nitramene, which was located in a safe that she was able to open.

Carter discovers the Nitramene
Carter then discovered that the formula had been used to create bomb, so she called Edwin Jarvis for assistance. When Carter confirmed that the bomb was glowing, Jarvis informed her to be careful with it, as it could create a massive implosion. However, Jarvis was unable to provide further assistance, due to his wife returning, leaving Carter on her own. Carter then went to leave, but discovered several SSR agents present. Once she knew she was clear, Carter left and rushed back home.

Carter mourns Colleen O'Brien
Once she got back, she spoke with Colleen O'Brien, who asked about where she had been. When she went to sleep, Carter began to disarm the bomb in the bathroom, and was successful. When she heard a noise, she discovered that O'Brien had been murdered, and Carter was then attacked by Sasha Demidov. Carter fought him off, injuring him in the process, and went to mourn the death of her friend. Enlisting the aid of Jarvis, Carter followed up a lead concerning the production of the Nitramene weapon based on information from one of Stark's associates, Anton Vanko.

Destruction of the Roxxon Refinery
Carter finds and threatens Leet Brannis
Tracking possible production to the factory owned by the Roxxon Corporation, Carter and Jarvis stumbled upon a whole production line of the weapons. Carter confronted Leet Brannis who told her that she could not stop Leviathan before setting one of the Nitramene bombs to implode. He escaped in the Daisy Clover truck filled with a new batch of the Nitramene bombs while Carter raced back to Jarvis's waiting car. They barely escaped as the bomb went off and the resulting implosion reduced the Roxxon factory to rubble.

Further Investigation
Carter disguised as Ruth Barton
Following the implosion, Carter then went to Howard Stark's Penthouse to rest. The next morning, posing as health inspector Ruth Barton, she found the name of the driver of the Daisy Clover milk truck, Sheldon McFee. She was then called in by Roger Dooley to help in discovering who was involved in the explosion by bringing to him a Vita-Ray Detector. While scanning Roxxon Corporation employees, Carter recognized one of the men as a guard she encountered while infiltrating the refinery. Carter then suggested to Dooley that they scan the workers' clothes for traces of Vita Radiation instead of their lab coats; Miles Van Ert tried to flee only to be easily incapacitated by Carter.

Carter fights Sheldon McFee
Carter and Jarvis went to the residence of Sheldon McFee; Carter encountered him and defeated him, tying him up. Brannis attempted to flee in McFee's milk truck, but Jarvis temporarily disabled it. As Carter and Jarvis drove back to Manhattan with Brannis in tow, they were attacked by Sasha Demidov again. Carter engaged him on top of the truck and after a brutal fight, managed to defeat him and stuck his hand to the truck as she and Jarvis escaped with Brannis. The truck, which was full of Nitramene, safely exploded inside the ocean.

Comfort
Edwin Jarvis tends to Carter's injuries
Back at Howard Stark's Penthouse, Edwin Jarvis tended to her wounds and told Carter that despite all her skills she could not handle everything by herself. When Carter argued that Steve Rogers could, Jarvis reminded her that Rogers would often rely on her for moral guidance and strength. He asked her to let him help her more; Carter felt comforted by his words and told him to continue stitching her wound.

Carter is interviewed by Miriam Fry
Carter decided to accept the invitation by Angie Martinelli to have an interview at the Griffith Hotel. Martinelli introduced Carter to the other tenants before her interview with Miriam Fry. Despite feeling that she had given two responses to the first couple of questions, Carter quickly worked out the sort of women Fry wanted at the hotel and lied about her dependence on men and desire to be married. Pleased with these answers, Fry told Carter the rules of the hotel, which included no men above the first floor, and allowed her to move into the room next door to Martinelli.

Humiliating Sacrifice
Carter is yelled at by Roger Dooley
Carter and Edwin Jarvis prepared to investigate the vault where Howard Stark's weapons were stolen but, before they could begin, Agents Jack Thompson and Daniel Sousa knocked on the door which questioned Jarvis and took him in for further interrogation. When Jarvis was threatened with the concept of him and his wife Ana Jarvis being deported due to a treason that Jarvis had committed during World War II, Carter knew she had to free him. Carter took the police theft report of Stark's car and later told Roger Dooley that she mistakenly took the report in Jarvis' presence, thus freeing him from his interrogation. She was taken into Dooley's office and humiliated in front of the rest of the SSR agents for being a seemingly incompetent agent. Dooley ordered her to apologize to Thompson who claimed that a sorry did not begin to make up for what she had caused. Carter and the rest watched as Jarvis was freed, leaving Dooley furious.

Finding the Weapons
Carter fights Jerome Zandow
After being reprimanded by an angry Dooley, she and Jarvis continued their investigation and found the ship that had some of Stark's stolen inventions. Finding the weapons, Carter prepared to call the find in, but Jarvis told her it would be too risky, and he called it in himself as an anonymous tipster. While waiting for Jarvis on The Heartbreak, Carter was confronted by Jerome Zandow, who attacked her. Jarvis came to her aide and together the two managed to subdue him and escape. The next day Carter found out that Ray Krzeminski had been killed. Deeply saddened by his death, she went to Angie Martinelli and confided in her and told her that despite all of Krzeminski's flaws, he was still a man good at his job.

Howard Stark's Return
Carter trying to sneak Howard Stark back
Carter and Edwin Jarvis sneaked Howard Stark back into the States through a train car by making a deal with two subordinates of smuggler Otto Mink; the deal went south when one of the men decided they should get paid more, forcing Carter to knock them out and free Stark. Carter attempted to take Stark to his penthouse, but it was being guarded by Yauch. Thinking of nowhere else to safely put him, Carter sneaked Stark into her apartment at the Griffith Hotel. 

Howard Stark gives Carter another mission
The next day, Stark gave Carter a Camera Pen to take pictures of the devices the SSR had confiscated. Later that day, Stark lied to Carter, telling her that the reason he came back was because the SSR had one of his most dangerous inventions, the Blitzkrieg Button, and he wanted it returned to him so he could deactivate it. On the way to the New York Bell Company Office, Carter started to get suspicious when she noticed Jarvis' nervous behavior.

Carter discovers Steve Rogers' blood
Discovering the device, Carter, against her better judgement, decided to activate it. The device opened, revealing a vial of blood. Returning to the Griffith, Carter asked Stark what was in the vial; after some reluctance, he revealed it to be Steve Rogers' blood. Angered, Carter punched Stark and berated him despite Stark's attempt to justify himself. Carter accused him of only wanting to make money and decided to cut all ties with him.

The Hunt for Leviathan
Carter ignores Edwin Jarvis' aploges
Carter headed to work when Edwin Jarvis tried to apologize for Howard Stark's lying to her; however, Carter refused to forgive Stark or Jarvis. Jarvis pointed out that the SSR would never treat her like an equal; Carter told him that she would make them change their minds.

Carter prepares for her mission to Belarus
At the New York Bell Company Office, the office was busy as Daniel Sousa told Carter that the Remote Typewriter had activated and that they had a cryptographer working on it. The cryptographer, however, proved to be having trouble decoding the message. Carter saw that the original language was Russian and easily decoded it, revealing to the others that the message was apparently Leviathan making a deal with Howard Stark for weapons in Belarus. Roger Dooley quickly told Jack Thompson to prepare a team to go to Belarus. Carter insisted that she come along, much to Thompson's and Dooley's chagrin. Carter pointed out that she had decoded the message and knew the way of the land in Russia, including knowing skills of how to survive in the mountains. Dooley acquiesced when Carter got them the assistance of the Howling Commandos. 

Carter and Dum Dum Dugan tell war stories
In Russia, Carter met up with the Commandos, which consisted Dum Dum Dugan, Happy Sam Sawyer, Pinky Pinkerton and Junior Juniper. Carter supplied Dugan with his favorite alcohol as payment for assisting her with the mission. As the two groups rested for the night they shared war stories. When Thompson sat down, they encouraged him to share one of his war stories. After some reluctance, Thompson told them the story of how he single-handedly killed Japanese soldiers that were attacking his unit while they were asleep, earning him a medal for bravery.

Carter and the Howling Commandos in Russia
The next day the group arrived at the Red Room Academy where they split up. Carter, Juniper, and Dugan realized that the facility was a school where they encountered Eva who quickly became hostile, stabbing Dugan and killing Juniper. Carter met up with Thompson's group and together they decided to leave. On their way out, they came upon two prisoners named Nikola and Ivchenko. The two had revealed that they had been kidnapped because of Nikola's intelligence and Ivchenko's status as a doctor to treat Nikola. They also revealed that Leviathan had stolen weapons from Stark. Freeing them, the group was pinned down by reinforcements and Mike Li was shot. When Nikola attempted to bargain Sawyer for his freedom, Li used the last of his strength to shoot him and the group escaped.
