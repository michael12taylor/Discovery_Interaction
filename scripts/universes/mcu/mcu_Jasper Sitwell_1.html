Jasper Sitwell was a HYDRA infiltrator who posed as a high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Sitwell had been indoctrinated into the ideology of HYDRA during his education with the HYDRA Preparatory Academy, for whom he took on a role as a double agent deep within S.H.I.E.L.D.'s ranks. During these years of service working undercover, Sitwell had become close friends with Phil Coulson, who was unaware of Sitwell's allegiances. Sitwell was among the agents assigned to an investigation of a mysterious hammer in New Mexico, which had been directly linked to Thor. In the aftermath of the Battle of New York, Sitwell had been assigned with the STRIKE team to transport Loki's Scepter away to HYDRA's laboratories.

Overtly, Sitwell conducted his duties with efficiency, while also covertly he aided the deep-rooted conspiracy to reshape the world within HYDRA's image, as he quietly attempted to push Coulson away from conspiracies involving the Clairvoyant, and assisting him with uncovering more information on Project T.A.H.I.T.I., which HYDRA wanted to learn more about. Sitwell had also assisted Alexander Pierce with portraying Captain America as an enemy of S.H.I.E.L.D.. Eventually, Sitwell's true allegiance to HYDRA was uncovered by Captain America and Black Widow, who kidnapped him, and then forced him to reveal the truth behind Project Insight. However, as the consequence of him betraying HYDRA's secret, Sitwell was assassinated by the Winter Soldier.

Biography
Early Life
Trained for HYDRA
Jasper Sitwell was born on Saturday, December 8, 1973 in Norfolk, Virginia as a Honduran American. In the 1990s, the teenage Sitwell studied at the HYDRA Preparatory Academy and made friends with Hale. During his training, Sitwell was provided a pet dog to look after, forming an attachment to the pet which HYDRA intended to use as his final test. Sitwell's goal during his training, was to be placed into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s admin, where he could secretly serve HYDRA's goals, although Sitwell also became bored by all of the lectures.

Daniel Whitehall's Lecture
Sitwell during his school training for HYDRA
A day before his graduation, Sitwell had been eating breakfast inside of the cafeteria, when he was joined by Hale, who commented on the amount of time they had left until they would be able to leave the HYDRA Preparatory Academy. As Hale questioned if he was excited to be leaving, Sitwell claimed that he was excited to be done with their lectures, as he was bored of the guest lecturers being old men discussing where HYDRA would place them after they graduated, although Hale insisted that the guest lecturer who would be coming in on that day was at least cool.

Sitwell awkwardly collecting all of his books
As Hale excitedly claimed that their lecturer had once managed to use alien DNA to reverse his own body's ageing process, only for Sitwell to mock her by pretending to fall asleep. As Hale claimed that Sitwell was simply jealous, he just scoffed at that and called Hale a teacher's pet, who had been better trained than any of their Dogs. However, Hale responded to this by claiming that Sitwell was jealous because she would be rising in the ranks of HYDRA and NASA, while Sitwell would end up in middle management within S.H.I.E.L.D., leaving Sitwell with no response as the school bell rang.

Sitwell listening to Daniel Whitehall's lecture
Sitwell joined the other students, as Steger introduced their guest speaker as Daniel Whitehall, causing the class to applaud. Sitwell listened as Whitehall spoke to them about Particle Infusion Chamber, and his plan to create a super soldier that could match Steve Rogers, as Whitehall turned to the class and questioned what substances could be used for their experiments. While Sitwell remained silent, he watched as Hale and Wolfgang von Strucker debated if they should use the Tesseract to look to outer space for HYDRA's future, with Whitehall complimenting Hale for her forward thinking.

Academy Graduation
Sitwell explains his S.H.I.E.L.D. placement
Following their exams, Sitwell was appointed as a HYDRA mole within S.H.I.E.L.D.'s administrative division. However, in order to prove his loyalty to HYDRA, Sitwell was ordered to execute his dog, as was every other graduate. While he read his results in the cafeteria, Sitwell was joined by Hale, as he explained his placement. As Sitwell at in silence, Hale acknowledged the harshness of killing his dog, although Sitwell insisted that he was fine, questioning Hale's results.

Sitwell comments on Hale's HYDRA future
However, Hale then explained that she had not heard about her own placement yet, to which Sitwell noted that he would be too if he had gotten into a fight with Wolfgang von Strucker, like Hale had the day before. Although Hale noted that Strucker had organized a vicious prank against her, Sitwell claimed that it did not matter, as punching HYDRA's future leader had likely resulted in Hale losing her chance of a good placement. However, before Hale could respond, Steger had then informed her that Daniel Whitehall wanted to speak with her about her placement, as Hale got up and left Sitwell behind her.

S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent
Clearance Level Six
Once he became a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, Sitwell served with distinction as a field operative, with his "Patsy" ploy becoming legendary within the agency, eventually rising to a Level six security clearance. When Tony Stark broke free from a cave in Afghanistan after being kidnapped by the Ten Rings, Sitwell informed Nick Fury about some sort of aircraft in the Kunar province with high energy signals.

Later, when Stark was in Gulmira, Fury asked Sitwell how similar these signals were to the previous one; Sitwell replied that it was both stronger and faster than last time. When Fury asked Sitwell to contact Edwards Air Force Base to call the F-22 Raptors off, he replied that they already had attempted radio contact but were not successful.

Finding Thor in New Mexico
Sitwell runs a S.H.I.E.L.D. base
While tailing Bruce Banner after his return into the United States, Sitwell was reassigned to New Mexico under Phil Coulson's leadership after the discovery of Mjølnir in the desert. During his time there, Sitwell ensured that all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were rerouting planes that flew over the area and making sure that there was little media attention directed at their investigation into understanding what the mysterious hammer was.

Sitwell learns that Thor is attacking the base
He was among the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who confiscated Jane Foster's research on wormholes as it appeared they were learning too much and had become a risk. Sitwell was the head of the laboratory studying the hammer when Thor attacked and attempted to retrieve Mjølnir and warned Coulson of the breach. As Thor continued to fight his way through the protected base against the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Sitwell warned Coulson and allowed him to call Clint Barton for assistance in the fight.

Sitwell interrupts Phil Coulson's interrogation
When Thor was finally apprehended after failing to reclaim Mjølnir as planned, Sitwell oversaw Coulson's interrogation as he attempted to learn who he was working for and where he had received his training. Sitwell called Coulson out of the interrogation briefly, at which point Thor was visited by Loki. When Coulson returned to the room to continue the questioning, Sitwell informed him that Erik Selvig had arrived to try and free him from their custody.

Sitwell witnesses the Destroyer's arrival
When another wormhole opened in the desert, Sitwell, Coulson and other S.H.I.E.L.D. investigated and witnessed the arrival of the Destroyer. Seeing the Destroyer, Sitwell asked Coulson if the robot was something of Tony Stark's design, but Coulson said that Stark never tells him anything. Afterward, the Destroyer attacked the agents and the nearby town, only to be saved by the intervention of Thor who had regained his powers.

The Consultant
Sitwell has a meeting with Phil Coulson
Sitwell met with Phil Coulson in a café to discuss a major problem: the World Security Council wanted Emil Blonsky freed from custody and integrated into the Avengers Initiative. Sitwell and Coulson both knew about Blonsky and decided to hatch a plan to avoid Blonsky's liberation.

Sitwell and Coulson discuss Thaddeus Ross
Eventually, the pair worked out a plan, choosing to send Tony Stark to annoy Thaddeus Ross, who had Blonsky in his custody at this time, to the point that he would never agree to release the prisoner. Sitwell met with Coulson the next morning to discuss how the meeting had gone down and Coulson confirmed that Stark had annoyed Ross so much that he had tried to have him removed until Stark had responded by buying the whole bar.

Chitauri Invasion
Sitwell locates Loki in Germany
Later, Sitwell was transferred to the Helicarrier as a computer expert. When Clint Barton and Erik Selvig were enthralled by Loki along with the Tesseract, Sitwell was charged with locating him while the Avengers were assembled to fight against Loki. Sitwell eventually located Loki in Stuttgart and informed Phil Coulson of his discovery, at which point S.H.I.E.L.D. sent Captain America and Iron Man on a successful mission to capture him.

Sitwell tries to regain control of the Helicarrier
While Loki was held captive onboard the Helicarrier and interrogated by Nick Fury and Black Widow, Sitwell remained on board the Helicarrier. During the Attack on the Helicarrier, Sitwell's computer abilities came in handy in regaining control of the Helicarrier despite the heavy damages it had sustained. While Fury and Maria Hill fought against the attacking force, Sitwell attempted to regain control of the ship when Barton damaged it through a hacking arrow, eventually succeeding.

Recovering Loki's Scepter
Sitwell and Brock Rumlow secure the Scepter
Following the Battle of New York, Sitwell left the Helicarrier and, under the orders of Alexander Pierce, regrouped with Brock Rumlow and his STRIKE unit. Heading to Stark Tower after Loki was apprehended by the Avengers, Sitwell and Rumlow were given the Scepter by Black Widow as S.H.I.E.L.D. wished to secure it.

Sitwell giving an update to Alexander Pierce
However, Pierce's true intention was for HYDRA to acquire and study the Scepter. As they took an elevator to the first floor, Sitwell notified Pierce that they had secured the Scepter and were en route towards List. The Scepter was taken to the S.H.I.E.L.D. S.T.A.T.I.O.N. before Mark Smith and Mark Basso brought it to Sokovia.

Item 47
Sitwell having his meeting with Felix Blake
Sitwell was partnered with Felix Blake to capture two bank robbers, who had at their disposal the only Chitauri Gun among the 47 retrieved in the aftermath of the Battle of New York which was still functioning. Beating Blake on time, Sitwell managed to foresee the two's movements and to anticipate them, and reach them in a motel where they were hiding out, with the order of collecting the weapon and executing the pair for their crimes.

Sitwell taking possession of the Chitauri Gun
Once at the motel, Sitwell took the room next to Benjamin Pollack's and Claire Wise's, and disturbed them with music at high volume. Pollack knocked on his door to ask him to lower the volume, but Sitwell easily subdued him and tied him up. Pollack managed to warn Wise, who attacked Sitwell with the Chituari Gun. During the subsequent fight, the gun was knocked loose and shot automatically, destroying most of the room, and all of the stolen money. 

Sitwell recruits Benjamin Pollack and Claire Wise
Sitwell tied up Pollack and Wise and prepared to follow his orders, however, he hesitated when Sitwell discovered that the gun was working because Pollack, who was a scientist, had repaired it. Seeing potential in the couple, Sitwell, instead of arresting or killing them, recruited Pollack and Wise to S.H.I.E.L.D., much to Blake's disappointment, taking Pollack into their R&D Think Tank while leaving Wise as Blake's assistant, much to his annoyance.

The Hub
Sitwell greets Phil Coulson's team to the Hub
Sitwell was assigned to work at the Hub, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s primary operational staging and support center under Victoria Hand's leadership. He was assigned to greet Phil Coulson and his team when they arrived, taking Coulson, Melinda May and Grant Ward to meet with Hand as they went to the briefing for the mission to disable the Overkill Device in South Ossetia.

Sitwell confronts Jemma Simmons
As the mission to disable the Overkill Device went ahead, Sitwell caught Jemma Simmons attempting to break access the Hub's mainframe. He initially tried to politely question her, as Simmons became more flustered and claimed to be searching for the bathroom while asking him not to ask her why she was there in the first place as she refused to answer his questions. Simmons desperately attempted to change the subject, commenting on Sitwell's height and baldness and seemingly attempting to awkwardly flirt with him.

Sitwell is shot by Jemma Simmons
Sitwell asked Simmons to produce her clearance level to prove she had the authorization to access the panel, but as she attempted to find it, she began talking to someone else on comms as she claimed that Sitwell was on to her. Realizing that Simmons could be a security threat to the Hub, Sitwell attempted to call for back-up, but Simmons shot him with a Night-Night Gun and rendered him unconscious before Simmons dragged his body away and hid him in a cupboard while she completed accessing the security panel.

Sitwell is debriefed by Victoria Hand
Sitwell was taken to the infirmary to be treated for the assault, and after his recovery, he returned to the Hub's control room and informed Hand that Leo Fitz and Grant Ward were clear of the danger zone, although he questioned why they had decided to put in an extraction plan, as he believed there was not going to be one. Hand revealed that she trusted that Coulson's team would extract themselves before she gave the order to Sitwell to mop up the final stages of the mission.

Meeting with Coulson
Sitwell having his meeting with Phil Coulson
Sitwell had a secret meeting in a car park with Phil Coulson, who had requested a meeting with Nick Fury. Sitwell claimed Fury was off the grid and would summon him if he wanted to talk, noting that Coulson was turning a lot of heads at S.H.I.E.L.D. due to the questions he was asking. As they prepared to leave each other, Sitwell casually asked how Coulson's alleged stay in Tahiti went, Coulson merely replied that it sucked before driving away.

The Clairvoyant
Sitwell listens to Phil Coulson aboard the Bus
Shortly afterwards, Sitwell met with Coulson, Victoria Hand, Felix Blake, Antoine Triplett, and John Garrett aboard the Bus. The team discussed Coulson's recent encounters with a terrorist who claimed to have Clairvoyant powers and was responsible for the creation of the Centipede Soldiers and the Deathlok. The team decided to split into pairs, each investigating a different individual with potential psychic powers that had been rejected from S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Index, in hopes of locating the Clairvoyant. However, Sitwell was called away on another mission, to escort the Lemurian Star, before he could participate.

Hostage Situation
Sitwell with hostages on the Lemurian Star
While Sitwell was aboard the Lemurian Star, the ship was hijacked by pirates led by Georges Batroc. Captain America, Black Widow, and Brock Rumlow led a STRIKE unit to retake the ship. Unbeknownst to Rogers and Romanoff, Sitwell was on the ship to guard sensitive information about Project Insight. Eventually, STRIKE operatives stormed the dock where pirates were holding hostages, took them down and released Sitwell.

HYDRA Uprising
Chase of Captain America
Sitwell leading the manhunt at the Triskelion
When Nick Fury was subsequently attacked and supposedly killed by the Winter Soldier, during the direct aftermath of this Steve Rogers had refused to hand over the information Fury had given him about Project Insight and was immediately branded a fugitive by Alexander Pierce. Sitwell commanded the operation and then ordered Brock Rumlow and his STRIKE team to capture Rogers, but they were unsuccessful and Sitwell watched Rogers escaping.

Sitwell gives a speech to Sharon Carter
With Rogers having just escaped the Triskelion and now on the run, Sitwell attempted to give orders to his S.H.I.E.L.D. team and told them to scan all cameras for a sighting of Rogers and report it directly to him. Despite his direct orders, Sitwell was questioned by Sharon Carter who demanded to know his reasons until Pierce arrived and personally explained the situation, claiming that Rogers had withheld important information about Fury's assassination.

Confessing HYDRA Secrets
Sitwell having his meeting with Senator Stern
Later, Sitwell had lunch with Stern, and they both discussed exercise regimes and Stern's sexual partners. As they prepared to leave, Stern complimented Sitwell's S.H.I.E.L.D. pin and they exchanged a secret phrase: Hail HYDRA; as Stern left with his security team. Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff had learned Sitwell was guarding the Project Insight information on the Lemurian Star and followed him to this location as they watched from a distance.

Sitwell being threatened by Sam Wilson
Unaware that he was being watched, Sitwell was called by Alexander Pierce but when he answered he spoke instead to Sam Wilson, who was watching him from across the street. Wilson informed Sitwell that he wanted him to get into a car down the street so they could go for a drive together, when Sitwell questioned why he should obey, Wilson revealed that a sniper had Sitwell in their sights and was ready to assassinate him if he did not obey these orders.

Sitwell being questioned by Steve Rogers
Wilson lured Sitwell to a rooftop where he was confronted by Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff who questioned him. Sitwell was at first confident about his situation as he believed that Rogers would be unwilling to actually kill him, and Rogers agreed. However, instead, Rogers allowed Romanoff to kick him off the roof, and Wilson used his wing suit to grab Sitwell and return him to the rooftop as he continued to scream in terror and was dumped on the ground.

Sitwell confesses the truth about HYDRA
Frightened by the experience, Sitwell revealed everything he knew about Project Insight and HYDRA's plans for the world. He explained that Arnim Zola had created an algorithm that would allow the three Helicarriers to target and execute millions of potential threats to HYDRA's rule, such as Bruce Banner and Stephen Strange. Sitwell feared that his life was in danger for exposing this information as he knew that he would now become a target for Pierce.

Killed by Winter Soldier
Sitwell continues to argue with Steve Rogers
Sitwell was kept as a hostage, thrown in a car and driven by Sam Wilson to the Triskelion, as Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff intended to use his biometric data to access the Project Insight Helicarriers and shut down Project Insight directly from the inside. Sitwell was mortified by the concept, calling Rogers crazy and the plan a terrible idea.

The Winter Soldier throws Sitwell into traffic
However, before Sitwell could argue his point, while they were driving along the freeway, the Winter Soldier leaped onto the roof of the car and attacked the group. Under the orders of Alexander Pierce, the Winter Soldier grabbed Sitwell with his metal arm and ripped him from the car, throwing him out the window into the opposite lane. Sitwell could only scream in terror before an oncoming semi-truck ran him over, killing him.

Legacy
Sitwell's Soldiers
Once it had become apparent to Coulson's Team that John Garrett was, in fact, the Clairvoyant, he was surrounded by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents with a kill-order from Victoria Hand, who believed that he and Coulson's team were sleeper HYDRA agents. Phil Coulson told the agents to arrest Garrett for being the Clairvoyant; but Garrett noted that Sitwell had recruited at least some of them, causing the agents loyal to HYDRA to execute their own comrades and surround Coulson's team, proving their loyalty to HYDRA.

Time Heist
Infiltration into Stark Tower
Sitwell ambushed by Captain America
In an alternate 2012, Sitwell, alongside the STRIKE team who were all secretly HYDRA agents, had taken possession of the Scepter after the Battle of New York. They then made their way to the elevator to leave Stark Tower.

Sitwell refuses to relinquish the Scepter
While informing Alexander Pierce that they were en route with the Scepter to List, Sitwell was caught by surprise when Captain America entered, as he was supposed to be coordinating a search and rescue team. When Sitwell and Brock Rumlow gave the STRIKE team cues to arm their weapons, Rogers claimed that Pierce had sent him to claim the Scepter.

Sitwell is tricked by Captain America
Both still confused, Sitwell threatened to call Nick Fury. Before he could, Rogers uttered "Hail HYDRA" in Sitwell's ear, shocking both him and Rumlow. Now having fully convinced them that he was a HYDRA operative, too, Rogers left the elevator in possession of the Scepter, leaving Sitwell and the STRIKE unit in disbelief back in the elevator.

Personality
Jasper Sitwell was always a straightforward person who lived for his job. He stayed cool, calm, and collected even in the most dangerous situations. However, even though he seemed to do everything by the books, Sitwell wasn't above breaking the rules from time to time. He spared the lives of Benjamin Pollack and Claire Wise even though he was ordered to eliminate them. He held no grudge against Jemma Simmons for knocking him down in the Hub and even agreed to have a secret meeting with Phil Coulson to give him confidential information about Nick Fury. However, behind the exterior of a loyal S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, Sitwell was actually a devoted HYDRA follower. He calmly agreed with HYDRA's Project Insight's intended objective to eliminate twenty million people because he felt that would enable HYDRA to establish the New World Order.

Abilities
Expert Martial Artist: Sitwell had a large knowledge of hand-to-hand combat, easily overpowering Benjamin Pollack in a fight.
Master Spy: Sitwell was a master spy, making all of S.H.I.E.L.D. believe he was a loyal agent of theirs when in reality he was an operative of HYDRA. According to his S.H.I.E.L.D. file, Sitwell worked primarily on Fury's most discreet and top-secret missions, having proven time and again that he was one of the agency's most dedicated and capable agents.
Expert Investigator: According to his S.H.I.E.L.D. file, Sitwell as an exceptional crime scene investigator. He tracked Benjamin Pollack and Claire Wise to a hotel in south Florida.
