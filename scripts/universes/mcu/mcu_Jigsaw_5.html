<html><p>Russo tells the crew about his final farewell
Getting in José's face, Russo noted that a lot of people had died as a result of the Punisher, which he accepted responsibility for. However, Russo went on to insist that he would not allow another one of their crew to die or spend the rest of their lives in a prison because of the Punisher's quest for vengeance against him, suggesting instead that they take their money and leave New York City for good, telling them to find something that was worth more to live for than their revenge. Russo then handed each member of the crew a new forged passport for them each to begin their new lives away from the Punisher.

Russo gives his crew new lives and leaves
Russo told his crew that this opportunity to get away from all of the violence would be his gift to them, as José accepted the passport and agreed not to pursue the Punisher anymore. Russo then looked down at the final passport, which was for Krista Dumont using the new name of Claire Russell, as one of the crew members questioned where Russo himself was planning on going. Russo however, simply told his crew that it did not matter where he was going, only who he was going with. Russo then told the crew that it had been an honor to work with them, before taking his bag of cash and leaving.

Attack on Dinah Madani
Russo buys blue flowers for Krista Dumont
While on his way back to her apartment, Russo decided to stop on the way and buy some flowers for Krista Dumont. As he looked at all of the flowers, Russo was greeted by the owner who asked what he was looking for, as Russo asked for something blue, thinking back to the therapy sessions he went through with Dumont at Sacred Saints Hospital, as the shop owner sold them to Russo and referred to him as Mr. Blue.

Russo sees Krista Dumont's damaged body
However, just as Russo returned to her apartment, he discovered to his absolute horror that Dumont had been thrown out of her window and been crippled on the street. As Russo looked down at Dumont's broken body for a moment, dropping all the blue flowers he had just bought for her ready for them to leave New York City. As Russo saw Dumont's body twitch, unsure if she was alive, he had looked up and discovered that it was Dinah Madani who had thrown Dumont out of the window. Seeing this, Russo was filled with rage as he ran into the building, ready to kill Madani for what she had done to Dumont.

Russo ruthlessly shooting at Dinah Madani
Enraged by what happened to Dumont, Russo charged upstairs and towards her apartment where Madani currently was, before shooting wildly through the walls at Madani, who in return fired back through the walls. Confirming where Madani was in the apartment, Russo had smashed through the door and began shooting at his former lover, screaming out loud as he did so while Madani dived behind the sofa for cover. Having emptied his entire magazine at Madani without ever hitting her, Russo had attempted to reload, only for Madani to get out from her cover and fire two bullets, hitting Russo in the stomach.

Russo yells at Dinah Madani for her attack
These two bullets in his stomach did not even slow the furious Russo down as he dropped his gun and instead charged straight at Madani, pinning her against the wall while screaming in her face as he called Madani a bitch and he had questioned why she had to bring Dumont into their conflict. Determined to get his revenge against Madani for crippling Dumont, Russo furiously threw her down onto the floor, as Madani used all of the strength to try and aim her gun at Russo and finally kill him. Although Russo attempted to hold her down, Madani was able to fire a third bullet straight through Russo's shoulder.

Russo attempting to strangle Dinah Madani
Still refusing to allow the pain of three deadly bullet wounds to keep him from killing Madani, Russo then proceeded to knock the gun out of her hands before punching Madani in the head, dazing her. Russo then wrapped his hands tightly around Madani's throat as he began squeezing the life out of her, with Madani desperately doing whatever she could to break free as she tried to knee Russo into his wounded stomach and wrapped her own hands around his throat. While Russo spat his blood in Madani's face, the pair tightened their grips around the other's throat and tried to see who would be the first to die.

Russo collapses right next to Dinah Madani
As the two had continued strangling each other, all the wounds that Russo had received began taking their toll since he had struggled to maintain his strength. However, it seemed he stayed conscious long enough as Madani dropped her grip around his neck and seemed to die. Seeing this, Russo had collapsed from his three gunshot wounds and his other injuries, falling down behind Madani. Russo then awoke several hours later and made his escape from the apartment before their New York City Police Department could arrive, as blood poured out of his gunshot wounds, leaving a trail of blood behind him.

Emergency Surgery
Russo demanding Charles to save his life
With his entire crew now disbanded, the wounded Russo had found himself with almost nobody to turn to as he continued bleeding out. Eventually, he found Charles and threatened him at gunpoint to perform emergency surgery to remove the three bullets that had been shot into his body by Dinah Madani. As they had prepared to begin, Russo had witnessed Charles drinking whiskey, as the clearly nervous Charles insisted that he needed the drink before they began.

Russo orders Charles to remove the bullets
As Russo turned down his drink offer, Charles told him that the gun was also making him nervous before requesting if he could move the bag full of money in order to get to Russo's bleeding stomach. While Russo complaining moaning over the agony he was in, Charles noted how he had lost a lot of blood before telling him that his career was based on assisting criminals with minor injuries, insisting that these wounds were far too serious and Russo should go to Sacred Saints Hospital for treatment, although Russo furiously refused to be taken to any hospital where he would then be arrested immediately.

Russo tries to stay awake during operation
Russo furiously demanded that Charles pull out those bullets himself and close up the wounds, which Charles agreed to. However, when Charles tried to bring over all the anesthetic, Russo refused to be put under, fearing that Charles would either kill him or hand him over to the New York City Police Department. Despite Charles still making it clear that this procedure would be too painful for Russo not to flinch and risk serious damage being done to his insides, Russo demanded that he proceed on without using any other anesthetic, which Charles was forced to reluctantly accept as he took yet another drink.

Russo falls unconscious from the surgery
As their procedure began tried his best to control his breathing while Charles used his tools to pull the single bullet out of his stomach, as Russo cried out in agony before the bullet had been taken out. Russo rushed Charles to take out the next bullet, as Charles pushed his tool into the next bleeding wound and attempted to find the bullet, which caused Russo even more pain as he screamed out. Finally, the pain became too much to bare and Russo fell unconscious, dropping the gun as a result. Seeing this, Charles then looked over at Russo's bag of cash and then made a decision on how to proceed with Russo.

Russo is left for dead by Charles in a dump
Eventually, Russo had awoken to discover that Charles had betrayed him, having left the final two bullets in his body and left him to die in the back alley dumpster. As Russo had attempted to move, he found that the pain was too much to bear as he realized to his horror, that Charles had not closed up any of the wounds, meaning that he was still bleeding heavily and now had little chance of surviving. Making matters worse, Russo realized that Charles had always taken his bag of money, meaning he could not even attempt to go to another black market doctor for medical assistance for his gunshot wounds.

Executed by the Punisher
Russo comes to accept his inevitable death
Without much time left until he lost so much blood from his gunshot wounds that he would finally die, Russo dragged himself across New York City to the one place he believed he could get some sympathy in his final moments. Arriving at St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church, Russo made a call to Curtis Hoyle, in a desperate hope that Hoyle was still a good enough man that he might come to his aid when Russo really needed him, as Russo confessed to the extremely surprised Hoyle that he was downstairs, bleeding all over his floor.

Russo tells Curtis Hoyle to be alongside him
Telling Hoyle about the wounds that Dinah Madani gave him, Russo confessed that he was dying without a hope of survival. Russo then begged Hoyle to come to his side, while requesting that he not call the New York City Police Department and instead come alone, while Hoyle promised to not call the police. Acknowledging that he did not deserve his sympathy following his many crimes against Hoyle and many others, Russo had still begged Hoyle to think back to their time serving in the United States Armed Forces and come help a brother one last time, noting that he simply did not want to die alone.

Russo being found bleeding by Frank Castle
Before long, Russo had heard the sounds of footsteps arriving in the basement and, while barely able to breath and with blood dripping out of his mouth, Russo had called out to Hoyle and thanked him for coming to his aid. However, to his horror, Russo discovered that it was actually Frank Castle who had arrived, having just been told of Russo's location by Hoyle. Seeing that Castle had sustained several more injuries following another fight with John Pilgrim, Russo noted that he did not look so good, before commenting that he should have known Castle would be the one to find him in his final moments.

Russo is finally killed by Frank Castle
With his tears rolling down his face, Russo had looked Castle dead in the eyes, as Castle showed absolutely no emotion to his dying friend while Russo had noted that he was actually glad that Castle was the one with him when he died. Despite still not remembering everything he had been apart of which had caused Castle's utter hatred of him, Russo attempted to use their final moments to apologize, but before he could get the words out, Castle raised his gun and fired two more bullets into Russo's chest, killing him. With that, Castle simply turned and walked out of the room, leaving Russo's corpse behind.

Post-Mortem
Case Wrapped Up
Russo's body was found by Brett Mahoney and Dinah Madani who were contacted by Curtis Hoyle, who closed the eyes of his former friend. Since Frank Castle left no evidence that he finished Russo, Madani suggested that she, in fact, shot him five times, instead of three. Despite Mahoney's skepticism, Mahoney was then forced to accept this version of events, since he had no other evidence and Hoyle and Madani had denied any knowledge of Castle. Both New York City Police Department and Homeland Security had accepted this version of events as the official story, and any mentioning of Castle were completely scrapped from reports of Russo's demise.

Personality
Initially, Billy Russo comes off as a suave, charismatic, patriotic, and intelligent man with a pleasant demeanor. He was shown to be a good friend to Curtis Hoyle, generously funding his support group, and seemed to be genuinely concerned for his former Marine comrade and best friend Frank Castle. Russo lived a successful life, owning his own company and partaking in a luxurious lifestyle.

Underneath this facade, however, Russo is a cruel, manipulative, and greedy man, willing to do anything in the pursuit of wealth and power. He kills and betrays numerous people throughout the series with little to no remorse, and even admits that he never "got turned around" during his time in the United States Marine Corps. Due to being abandoned by his mother and living troubled childhood, Russo believes that deep down he is worthless, and thus is desperate to obtain money and status in order to validate his self-worth. He takes great pride in his handsome appearance, which fuels his arrogant attitude, to the point when after he sees his face horrifically mutilated by Frank, he begs to be killed.

Russo’s personality drastically changes after his encounter with Castle, in which he sustained brain damage that resulted in losing the memory of his crimes. His inability to remember what happened prior to his hospitalization makes him deranged, aggravated, and desperate for answers. Despite all this, Russo shows that he still holds the same selfish and criminal values as before, immediately forming his own crew in which he robs and murders various people across New York.

Despite his callous nature, Russo is not completely heartless. He was shown to have cared for Castle's family and refused to be involved in their murder, though he also did nothing to prevent William Rawlins from enacting it. Even though he was primarily using her, Russo also somewhat cared for Dinah Madani, refusing to have sex with her when she was emotionally unstable and telling her a sensitive story about his childhood. He would later form a romantic relationship with his psychiatrist Krista Dumont, whom he loved dearly and was willing to even abandon his vendetta against Castle just to be with her.
