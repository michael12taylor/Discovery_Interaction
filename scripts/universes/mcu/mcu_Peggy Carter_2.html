<html><p>Parting ways, Carter said goodbye to Dugan, who jokingly code-named her "Miss Union Jack", and Ivchenko, having nowhere else to go, decided to go back with Carter and the others to use what he knew to help the SSR against Leviathan. On the plane ride home, Carter tried to cheer Thompson up about freezing during the gunfight. Thompson revealed to her that the soldiers who seemingly attacked his unit were actually surrendering and told her that he had been struggling on how to tell that story. Carter reassured him that he already did. Back in the U.S. Thompson and Carter reported to Dooley and told him of their findings. Thompson then invited Carter for some drinks.

Search for an Assassin
Carter questions Ivchenko
With Ivchenko now with the SSR and willing to help in their investigation, Carter, Jack Thompson and Roger Dooley began to question him about Leviathan. Carter showed particular interest in Leviathan's training of young female assassins, as she believed a female assassin was responsible for the killing of Ray Krzeminski and had possibly seduced Howard Stark to steal his weapons. Dooley ordered her to dig deeper and learn more about the Leviathan's female assassins.

Carter visits Howard Stark's old lovers
Carter called on Edwin Jarvis for assistance again and together they visited many of Stark's former lovers of the last six months to see if they could be an assassin. Carter believed that they would have scarred wrists from being handcuffed to beds their entire lives. In the end, there was only one woman named Ida Emke that they were unable to locate.

Chased by the SSR
Carter is cornered by Jack Thompson
Carter and Jarvis visited the L&L Automat to discuss their next move. While there, Carter realized that many SSR agents had arrived and ordered all civilians to safety. Knowing she was about to be arrested, Carter and Jarvis fought off the agents and tried to escape. Outside they were cornered by Jack Thompson; however, Carter was able to disarm him and knock him out. Next, Daniel Sousa tried to arrest her but Carter told him that he would never be able to shoot her; he let her go, promising her that she would be caught.

Carter hides from the SSR
Carter ran back to the Griffith Hotel in order to collect Steve Rogers' blood. She made it to her room but the SSR was quickly behind her. She collected the blood and decided to hide on the ledge outside the building. Thompson and Sousa searched her room. She was spotted by Angie Martinelli; when the agents went into Martinelli's room to question her, she helped Carter escape by distracting the agents. After they left, Martinelli helped Carter into her room and arranged for a car to take out of town. Carter said goodbye to her friend and promised to one day tell her everything.

Dottie Underwood kisses Carter
With the coast clear, Carter tried to make her escape from the Griffith but was stopped by Dottie Underwood. At first, Underwood seemed concerned for Carter's safety, but when she tried to get past, Underwood grabbed her and kissed her. Carter quickly recognized her own Sweet Dreams Lipstick and began to fall unconscious. Moments before she collapsed, she looked at Underwood's wrist and saw her scars, knowing she was the assassin. Carter awoke in the SSR's car being driven back to headquarters where she was put in the interrogation room where she began to be questioned by Sousa, Thompson and Dooley.

Interrogation
Carter is brought into the SSR as a prisoner
Roger Dooley, Daniel Sousa, and Jack Thompson took turns interrogating Carter using different methods; Dooley used disappointment, Sousa used friendship, and Thompson hoped that Carter would give them Howard Stark. Carter observed their methodology but none of them seemed to believe what she was trying to tell them.

Carter hands over the Blitzkrieg Button
Edwin Jarvis came with a fake confession, claiming it was from Howard Stark, and stopped the interrogation. Dooley told Carter that she was fired from the SSR; Carter cleared what little she had from her desk. However, when she and Jarvis saw Ivchenko using Morse Code to communicate with someone across the street, Carter told the three agents everything that had been happening and allowed Dooley to open the Blitzkrieg Button to see that it contained Steve Rogers' blood sample.

The Death of Roger Dooley
Carter witnesses Roger Dooley's death
Carter and Jarvis were still in the interrogation room when Dooley, under the thrall of Ivchenko, held them at gunpoint, cuffed them to a desk, and locked them inside, breaking the key. Carter and Jarvis worked to escape to find Dooley unconscious, wearing the Stark Heat Vest. Carter went to Alex Doobin for help to remove the vest because Jarvis advised that it would explode if removed improperly. Doobin said that he was helpless; Dooley had Carter promise him that she would bring Ivchenko to justice. Carter watched as Chief Dooley jumped from a window as the vest exploded. Carter and the agents wondered what Ivchenko wanted, and she was relieved when the Blitzkrieg Button was still in the laboratory. Doobin revealed that Item 17 was missing.

Massacre at the Cinema Theater
Carter witnesses the effects of Midnight Oil
Carter, Daniel Sousa and Jack Thompson assisted the New York City Police Department with investigation a massacre in a theater. Carter realized that the people in the cinema killed each other with their bare hands. Sousa found a cylinder and accidentally released the Midnight Oil; he then tried to kill Thompson. Carter attempted to help Thompson but Sousa knocked her away before a police officer knocked him out with a baton. Carter later talked with Sousa after he awakened; he explained that he wanted to kill everyone at that moment. Thompson explained that the chemicals make people highly aggressive and that Ivchenko had enough to kill half of the city.

Carter and the SSR greet Howard Stark
While Carter and the others contemplate Ivchenko's motives, Howard Stark entered saying he was his target. Thompson confronted Stark with all the deaths caused by his gas. Stark explained that the gas was called Midnight Oil and that it was designed for soldiers to stay awake. During the war General John McGinnis raided his laboratory and took all his designs. Learning about the Midnight Oil he decided to use the weapon of Stark on the Russian army to motivate them to attack the Germans and take Finow. However, the weapon made them go into a murderous rage and they started to kill each other.

Carter learns the truth about Johann Fennhoff
Perusing the files Stark had brought with him, Carter found dossiers on Leet Brannis and Sasha Demidov, who were both at Finow. As Stark mentioned that Midnight Oil is known to cause asphyxiation, Carter deduced that someone performed laryngectomy on the two survivors, rendering them voiceless. She suspected Ivchenko to be responsible as she opened his file, revealing his true identity as Johann Fennhoff, a master of hypnosis. Stark chose to act as bait so they can lure Ivchenko in. Carter later told Stark that she did not like his plan. Stark expressed that it was his fault for what happened at Finow, and he wanted to redeem himself for the mistakes he had made.

Kidnapping of Howard Stark
Carter takes cover as shots are fired
Carter was later present at the press conference where the treason charges against Stark were publicly dropped. As he prepared to speak, a sniper started to shoot at Stark. Taking cover, Carter deduced the position of the sniper as Stark was taken away from the New York City Hall podium. Carter and Thompson went to the sniper nest to learn that it was a rigged rifle to act as a distraction. Carter and the group deduced that they will spread the Midnight Oil with a plane from Stark's private airstrip.

Raid of Howard Stark's Warehouse
Carter finds and threatens Johann Fennhoff
The group reached the warehouse just as a hypnotized Stark left with a plane to spread the Midnight Oil. They decided that Edwin Jarvis would follow Stark with a fighter plane and shoot him down if Stark could not be snapped from the trance. Carter grabbed a shotgun and sought Dottie Underwood and Johann Fennhoff. She found them and tried to stop them from communicating with Stark. Underwood quickly disarmed her with a kick. Carter tried to fight Underwood but got easily tossed to the floor. Underwood prepared to kill Carter with a baseball bat, but Carter ducked the swing and used the moment to kick Underwood through the window and she fell hard on the wing of a plane.

Carter speaks to Howard Stark over a radio
Carter then took that opportunity to talk to Stark over the radio; she knew that if Stark reached New York City, he would be shot down by Edwin Jarvis who was chasing in another plane. Stark, under Fennhoff's influence, believed that he was going to retrieve their friend Steve Rogers from the icy waters; Carter listened as Stark told her that Captain America was his greatest achievement. Refusing to listen on the radio as another loved one died, Carter cried as she told Stark to follow her example as she let Rogers go. Stark listened and his trance was broken. When Carter sought Underwood, she was gone

Carter tells Daniel Sousa she knows her value
With Johann Fennhoff's Campaign quelled, Carter received a standing ovation from her colleagues for saving the city. However, Thompson took credit for the save when Senator Walt Cooper arrived. Though Sousa wanted to tell the senator the truth, Carter assured him that she did not care about the approval of others, as she know her value, making other's opinions invalid. Sousa asked Carter if she wanted to get a drink with him; but she smiled, but took a raincheck.

Letting Go
Carter pours Steve Rogers' blood away
As a reward for her help, Stark gave Carter one of his houses; she chose Angie Martinelli as a housemate. Jarvis gave her the vial of Rogers' blood that Stark had stolen from the New York Bell Company Office. Later, that same evening, Agent Carter took the very last vial of Steve Rogers' blood and finally let go of her greatest love by pouring his blood into the water under the Brooklyn Bridge, saying one final goodbye to the man she considered to be the greatest she had ever known. As she watched the sun rise, Carter reflected upon the future and prepared to continue making a new life for herself as the woman Captain America always knew she would be and prepared to continue her missions working with the SSR and save the world that Rogers had left behind.

Capturing Dottie Underwood
Carter challenges Dottie Underwood
Sometime after Fennhoff's incarceration, Daniel Sousa left New York City to work as the chief of the SSR compound in Los Angeles. Carter tried to keep in touch with him, but he rarely answered her messages. A full year passed, whereas Carter soon learned that Dottie Underwood was trying to rob Bowery Savings Bank.

Carter fights Dottie Underwood in the vault
Carter and multiple SSR agents, including Chief Jack Thompson, prepared an ambush to arrest her and her hired accomplices. Dressed in a style identical to Carter, Underwood and her cohorts took over the bank and forced the personnel to open the vault. As the vault opened, Carter appeared and held her at gunpoint with a shotgun. The SSR agents quickly drew their weapons and arrested the accomplices. Underwood was able to knock out an SSR agent and disarm Carter. The two engaged in a fierce fight but Carter managed to knock her out with a bag of money.

Carter is ordered to go to Los Angeles
At the New York Bell Company Office, Carter questioned the Soviet operative about her contacts and employers, but Underwood remained calm and mentioned that girls like Carter are too used to getting what they want the easy way. Carter asked about a deposit box of a unknown client and wanted to know why Underwood wanted the contents, a lapel pin with an "A"-like symbol; Underwood told her there are currencies stronger than money. Chief Thompson interrupted the interrogation and told her she was going to Los Angeles for a case there, stating that he would interrogate Underwood himself.

Investigation in Los Angeles
Carter is met by Edwin Jarvis in Los Angeles
Landing in Los Angeles she met Edwin Jarvis again. Carter learned that Howard Stark had a defense contract meeting here and, since he liked the scene, had decided that he wanted to create his own movie studio. Jarvis invited Carter to stay with him and his wife on Stark's estate. While driving Carter through Los Angeles, Jarvis also had to transport Stark's newest addition to his menagerie, a flamingo called Bernard Stark. Jarvis told Carter his life was quite boring right now and he would be pleased to drive her around. 

Carter at the Auerbach Theatrical Agency
Jarvis dropped her off at the Auerbach Theatrical Agency, the cover of the local Strategic Scientific Reserve office, where she was greeted by Rose Roberts. Roberts and Carter discussed Roberts' life in Los Angeles, that Roberts had picked up surfing, and that somehow artists kept showing up for the office, despite their attempts to keep it hidden. Chief Daniel Sousa seemed surprised by her presence but told Carter she was welcome to his team. He introduced her to the police liaison who was skeptical about their odds of capturing the Lady of the Lake Killer.

Carter speaks with Meltzer
Carter immediately theorized that the dead body might not be connected to the frozen lake. She learned the body of the woman was frozen through and somehow the body did not warm up despite multiple heat lamps pointed at it. Carter and Sousa visited the lab technician, who told them the body was not frozen in ice but in a substance that remained frozen. The technician told Carter that the substance was probably related to Isodyne Energy, a cutting edge development laboratory. 

Isodyne Energy
Carter meets Jason Wilkes
Carter, Sousa and the liaison cop Henry arrived at the laboratory but the Receptionist refused them access as they did not have a warrant. Annoyed, Carter noticed that the scientists accessed the lab through a door controlled by electronic cards. She signaled Sousa, who began to flirt with the receptionist, allowing Carter to steal a card and sneak inside the lab. Moving through the lab, she accidentally walked into the scientist Jason Wilkes, who let her taste some wine he developed. As they talked he appeared quite charmed by her. Carter told him about their investigation and he agreed to help her. Wilkes told Carter that Calvin Chadwick, his boss, was rumored to be the lover of the murdered woman. However, as they talked, the receptionist found Carter and forced her from the lab.

Carter and Edwin Jarvis arrive at the racetrack
Carter brought her findings to Sousa and Henry; however, Henry did not want her to investigate Chadwick but rather, get word out to the press. Sousa appeared to agree with Henry, to Carter's dismay, but when Henry had left, Sousa gave Carter leave to confront Chadwick. Edwin Jarvis drove her to the house and Carter was introduced to his wife Ana, who hugged Carter and found her an outfit to wear to the track. At the racetracks, Carter and Jarvis found Chadwick with his wife, Whitney Frost. While Jarvis distracted Frost, Carter confronted Chadwick. However, Chadwick refused to cooperate and Carter, angered, left.

Kidnapping of Jason Wilkes
Carter learns of Jason Wilkes kidnapping
Carter, Sousa, Jarvis, and Henry returned to the medical examiner's office, meeting Jason Wilkes there. However, as Carter drew nearer to the examiner, she saw with horror that he was frozen. When he was touched, the body shattered, leaving shards on the floor. Jarvis left the room to get air, and Carter and Sousa sent Wilkes out so that they could talk. The two began to suspect Henry; however, when they looked for him they realized that Henry had kidnapped Wilkes and left. Carter and Sousa tracked Henry down and Carter saved Wilkes.

Carter speaks with Daniel Sousa
Carter and Sousa then cornered Henry, who was dying as he was slowly getting frozen. Before they could learn who he worked for a policeman shot him, despite Carter's orders not to use guns. Carter scolded him but the policeman claimed he had not heard their order. Carter talked to Wilkes and comforted him. Wilkes wanted to thank her properly and invited her to go out with him; however, Carter declined as she had the rule to not socialize with persons of interest. She then talked to Sousa and they noted the case was not closed. Carter invited Sousa for drinks but he mentioned could not as he had something else planned that night. Carter then watched him meet a woman and drive away. 

Learning of Zero Matter
Carter challenges Edwin Jarvis
The next day, Carter noticed Edwin Jarvis in an exercise area near the garden. Jarvis explained he had started to train himself intensely in weightlifting and the martial arts, even challenging her to a sparring match. Carter was initially uncertain but threw Jarvis when he kept insisting and repeatedly poking her in the shoulder. However, Carter was surprised as Jarvis tripped her and pinned her. Ana Jarvis came in and recognized the technique as what her husband called the 'Tortoise of Fury'. Jarvis mentioned Ana acted as his sparring partner and knew all his strengths and weaknesses. Ana asked if Carter wanted another round of sparring; however, Carter told her she had to leave for work. 

Carter meets and chats with Violet
Arriving at the office, Carter met Violet, Daniel Sousa's girlfriend, when Violet dropped by to deliver cookies to Sousa. The two chatted and learned that their family was from the same town. When Sousa entered the office with Rose Roberts, Violet asked him to allow Carter to come with them on their date. Though Carter tried to back out, Violet would not hear of it.

Carter learns of an assassination
Later, Carter accompanied Sousa to where the bodies of the men transporting Jane Scott's body were found. Carter and Sousa received a search warrant for Isodyne Energy from Jack Thompson and went to investigate; however, they were stymied when they entered and found that the facility was being shut down due to a radioactive accident. As Carter turned to leave, she saw Jason Wilkes enter; she asked him to confirm the story, which he hesitantly did before passing her a note and continuing into the facility. Carter and Sousa left the building. Reading Wilkes' note, Carter learned he wanted her to meet him in a club to talk. 

Ana Jarvis helps Carter pick out a dress
Back at the Agency, Sousa offered Carter backup as she went to meet Wilkes. Carter refused, stating that the note told her to come alone. Sousa told Carter to change her outfit to match the location, it being a nightclub. Sousa tried to cancel his date to come with Carter, but she refused his offer again after seeing that he had planned the date to give Violet an engagement ring. Carter returned to Stark's estate, where Ana Jarvis helped her find an outfit for the nightclub. Carter mentioned she looked forward to meeting someone outside the SSR. Going to the car, Edwin Jarvis informed Carter of the S.O.S. signal that could be activated from the car. Carter left to meet Wilkes.

Carter meets with Jason Wilkes
Carter met Wilkes in the club and, while she wanted to talk about the case, he tried to get to know her more. Carter ended up talking about her childhood while Wilkes did the same. Just then, the singer began a song that was one of Wilkes' favorites. The two started to dance, still talking about their pasts. Carter learned how Wilkes had worked his way to his position at Isodyne, and she convinced him to help her in her investigation. Wilkes showed her a film reel of an Isodyne test in the desert where multiple vehicles and personnel were sucked up in a sort of black hole created by a substance Isodyne named Zero Matter.

On the Run
Carter hot-wires a car to escape in
Carter and Wilkes were attacked by men sent to silence Wilkes. Carter and Wilkes worked together to defeat the men, escaping by stealing the men's car, since the men had slashed the tires on theirs. Carter managed to activate the S.O.S. beacon before she and Wilkes left, hoping that someone would see it and help. In the stolen car, Carter found a lapel pin identical to the one that Dottie Underwood had attempted to steal.

Carter and Jason Wilkes ask to use the phone
Carter and Wilkes tried to find a phone booth; they entered a store where the owner was distrustful of Wilkes due to his color. Though Wilkes was accustomed to the treatment, Carter was offended. She asked to use the pay phone outside the store, the man told her she needed to buy something. Carter bought a pastry and ate it as she and Wilkes reached the phone. Trying to make the call, Carter noticed a car drive up; scared it was their enemies, she kissed Wilkes to block the car's view. When the occupant entered the store, Carter and Wilkes stole the car and drove to Isodyne Energy Headquarters.

Infiltration of Isodyne Energy Headquarters
Carter fails to find Jason Wilkes
Carter and Wilkes entered Isodyne Energy Headquarters; the two split up, Carter disguising herself as a scientist and fighting Rufus Hunt and his men while Wilkes retrieved the Zero Matter. However, once the men were defeated, there was a black explosion from the facility. Horrified, Carter searched for Wilkes but could not find him. The SSR arrived, having been informed by Edwin Jarvis that Carter was in trouble, and Carter emerged from the smoke and reported to Daniel Sousa. Shellshocked, Carter returned to Howard Stark's Estate, saddened by the apparent loss of Wilkes. 

Carter and Ana Jarvis discuss Jason Wilkes
There, Ana Jarvis brought her whiskey instead of tea, telling Carter she had noticed Carter looked distracted and disheveled. Carter told Ana she believed Wilkes was dead, and that she did not know why she was so depressed as she had only known him a short time. Ana told her about how she and her husband had only known each other a short time, and that it did not take long to realize you had met someone special.

Seeking the Truth
Carter arrives at the Wilkes Residence
Carter and Daniel Sousa investigated the house of Jason Wilkes, working alongside other SSR agents. Carter told Sousa that she blamed herself for Wilkes' death, citing that she had brought him into danger. Carter found a hollow area in the floor, where she discovered a Russian passport. Agent Vega then entered, having found the gun used to kill the agents transporting Jane Scott's body. Carter shrugged off the theory that Wilkes was a Communist, believing that the documents were planted in an attempt to frame Wilkes. 

Caretr visits Howard Stark at his movie set
Carter and Edwin Jarvis visited Howard Stark, who was filming his new Western movie based on Kid Colt. Carter and Jarvis accidentally interrupted the shot, causing Stark to cut early. Stark offered Carter a minor role in the movie; however, Carter told him that she should play the main role. Stark agreed, but doubted the audience would accept a female lead. Carter and Jarvis then showed Stark the film reel Jason Wilkes had stolen from Isodyne Energy, showing the explosion that revealed Zero Matter. Stark was elated by the film, stating that Zero Matter might be the greatest invention of the century. Carter watched as Stark noticed the lapel pin she had stolen; she was shocked when he recognized the insignia as that of the Arena Club, a exclusive club for wealthy white elitists. Jarvis told Carter that the club had tried to recruit Stark but he had refused, since no women members were allowed.

Carter returns to Howard Stark's Estate
Carter and Sousa returned to the SSR office, where they found newspapers claiming Wilkes was a communist spy. Outraged, Carter entered Sousa's office only to find Jack Thompson, who had flown to Los Angeles from New York. Thompson told Carter and Sousa that he had filed the report confirming Wilkes as a spy, asking them to agree with the report. Carter vehemently refused, refusing to lie. Returning to Howard Stark's Estate, Carter found Stark holding a pool party, which he claimed helped him think. Carter told Stark she had a plan to infiltrate the Arena Club and plant listening devices. Stark told her that the plan was boring, and that she would have a difficult time getting into the club, as the club was men only. Carter stole Stark's drink to convince him to listen to her plan, which she told him was far from boring.

Snooping in the Arena Club
Carter infiltrates the Arena Club
As part of her plan, Carter waited outside the Arena Club with a group of other women while Howard Stark entered the club. When Stark called the ladies in, Carter entered the club with them but slipped to one side, moving through the rooms and planting listening devices. Carter entered a library; when she tried to plant a device, a bookshelf slid open, revealing a secret room. Carter hid as men exited the room, before the door closed, Carter entered the room, hoping to plant a device, when she noticed a Los Angeles Tribune newspaper on a table. Carter was shocked to notice that the date on the paper was the next day's, and that the paper seemed to predict Representative Anderson dropping out of the Senate race.

Carter is rescued by Edwin Jarvis
Suddenly, the bookshelf opened again; Carter managed to slip under the table and hide from the man who entered. She tried to plant a device under the table, but something caused the device to malfunction; Carter disabled the device to avoid being discovered. As the man moved through the room, Carter crawled behind a chair, where she lit a cloth flower on fire to distract the man, allowing her to escape the room. The plan worked, and Carter successfully left the room, covering for her presence by taking a book from the shelves. As she left the library, another man confronted her. While she tried to act innocent, Edwin Jarvis entered and, feeling she needed help, accompanied her out the room. Carter and Jarvis informed Stark that they had finished; everyone left the club.

Carter experiencing side affects of Zero Matter
Armed with her knowledge of the club, Carter returned to the SSR and informed Daniel Sousa and Jack Thompson of the apparent blackmailing happening in the club. However, since she did not have the newspaper, Thompson remained skeptical. Carter called Thompson a coward for not doing the right thing, and Thompson ordered her to return to New York. Outraged, Carter stormed out of the office but was confronted by Sousa, who told Carter that she was blaming herself too hard for what had happened to Jason Wilkes. As they talked, Sousa noticed a pen floating in the air near Carter, which she knew was a side affect of zero matter.

Howard Stark examining Carter
Shocked, the two drove to Stark's, where Stark examined Carter, theorizing that she may have been contaminated by Zero Matter. Stark used technology he was developing to reveal what energy was surrounding Carter. To everyone's surprise, Wilkes was revealed, insubstantial, but trying to talk. Carter watched as Stark sprayed his gas on Wilkes' vocal cords, allowing Wilkes to speak. Carter listened as Wilkes revealed what had happened at Isodyne Energy, that he had tried to get the Zero Matter but had been confronted by Whitney Frost, who fought him for the Zero Matter. Wilkes continued, saying that during the fight, the container had broken and an explosion occurred, after which he found himself invisible and intangible. As Carter watched, Wilkes lost his visibility and faded from view. Stark prepared to develop a formula to keep Wilkes visible, and Carter told the others that she would confront Frost.

Investigating Whitney Frost
Carter meets Whitney Frost
Carter found the set where Whitney Frost was filming; she asked politely and was allowed access to Frost's dressing room. Carter told Frost that she wished to ask about the explosion at Isodyne Energy Headquarters; however, Frost claimed that Jason Wilkes' death was a tragedy, citing that Wilkes was a communist. Carter asked Frost about her involvement with Isodyne Energy, but Frost acted completely innocent, claiming to know nothing of Isodyne's research and denying she had been in Isodyne's lab when the explosion occurred. Carter and Frost discussed how newspapers lie, and Carter told Frost that her instincts told her that things were not as they seemed. Frost was called to set, and Carter left the studio. Returning to Howard Stark's Estate, she found Wilkes visible again. She briefly talked to him, telling Wilkes that it was a feat to impress Stark and that Wilkes had done it. Carter also told Wilkes that she was glad he was alive.

Assault at the Mansion
Carter is attacked by Rufus Hunt
That evening, Carter worked out on a punching bag in the garden. Edwin Jarvis entered, and asked Carter if she thought working out so late was a good idea. Carter replied that she considered it a good way to relieve frustrations of the day. Jarvis left, and Carter continued working out. She was suddenly attacked from behind by a masked assailant, who began choking her with a rope. Carter tried to fight him off, and maneuvered them both to the pool, knocking herself and the man into the water. In the pool, Carter freed herself and tried to get out, but the assassin knocked her down and prepared to kill her, Jarvis appeared and defended Carter, knocking the man back. The assassin drew a gun and tried to shoot Carter, but the gun failed, having been disabled by the water. Carter retrieved her gun from her purse and shot at the man, wounding him in the hand before he escaped.

Carter speaks to Jason Wilkes
The next morning, Carter noticed Jarvis installing a security system to avoid another attack. Carter told Jarvis that she felt reinvigorated about the case, and that she was certain they were on the right track. Carter visited Howard Stark and Jason Wilkes, finding Wilkes visible and Stark filled with caffeine, frantically packing for Peru. When Carter asked why he was leaving for Peru, Stark explained that he was visiting an old professor of his who might know more on creating a solution to keep Wilkes substantial. When he left to pack more, Wilkes told Carter that Stark was a genius, and that he was surprised at how quickly Stark had accepted him. Carter told Wilkes that she regretted him getting hurt, as she was the one to bring him into danger. Wilkes replied that he was thinking about leaving Los Angeles, as he believed his presence was causing enemies to hunt Carter. Carter insisted that Wilkes stay, citing that they would need him. Wilkes agreed, only because Carter asked.

The Real Whitney Frost
Carter is told more about Whitney Frost
Carter returned to the SSR office and spoke to Daniel Sousa, who showed her files on Agnes Cully, a wartime inventor and genius. Carter listened as Sousa explained that Cully was the driving force behind Isodyne Energy, before telling Carter that Agnes Cully was the real name of Whitney Frost, causing Carter to comment the cunning behind the notion of how everybody in America seemingly knows Frost as an actress but not her worth as a master scientist. Carter later spoke with Jason Wilkes, who mentioned that he missed food in his intangible state. Carter told Wilkes she was sorry for him, to which Wilkes replied that being around her made it worth it. Wilkes explained to Carter that Frost exceeded everything with her inventions, and that she defied categorization.

Kidnapping of Rufus Hunt
Carter watching Calvin Chadwick leaving
Carter and Edwin Jarvis tried to learn more about Whitney Frost, shadowing Frost's husband, Calvin Chadwick, at his campaign office. Jarvis entered the office, and returned with a campaign pin for Carter, which she promptly dropped out the window. Carter watched as Chadwick exited the office, and left with his car. Carter noticed that Chadwick's driver had a wound on his hand in the same place she had shot her assailant from the night before, realizing that Chadwick's driver was the man who had tried to kill her.

Carter and Edwin Jarvis create a plan
Carter asked for more information and they learned that the driver was Rufus Hunt, a former soldier who had been dishonorably discharged and was now the head of security at the Arena Club. Carter mentioned that as the chief of security he probably had access to all kinds of information about the dishonorable activities happening in the club. Worried about the combat skills of Hunt, Carter wanted to avoid a direct encounter. Jarvis came up with a tranquilizer rifle he sometimes used to control the animals of Howard Stark. 

Carter shoots Rufus Hunt with a tranquillizer
Carter and Jarvis went to the house of Rufus Hunt. Carter went around back to confront Hunt as Jarvis pretended he was a policeman trying to arrest Hunt, knowing that he would attempt to escape out the back garden. As Hunt ran outside, Carter shot him with a tranquilizer dart strong enough to bring down a rhinoceros. However, despite the strength of the tranquillizer, Hunt was able to keep upright.

Carter is put in a chokehold by Rufus Hunt
Carter fought him but Hunt threw her to the ground and grabbed her in a chokehold. Unable to escape his grasp, Carter managed to stab him with another tranquilizer dart and Hunt passed out. Carter and Jarvis stashed him in the trunk of her car; however, Hunt was still conscious and punched Jarvis, forcing Carter to hit him with the gun. As she shut the trunk, she noticed Hunt had stabbed Jarvis with a tranquilizer dart; Jarvis toppled to the ground as she watched.

Carter tries to lie to Daniel Sousa
Carter drove back to Howard Stark's Estate with a sleeping Edwin Jarvis in the backseat and an unconscious Rufus Hunt in the trunk. As she reached the mansion, she noticed Daniel Sousa waiting for her. Hoping he would not notice Hunt and Jarvis, she walked towards him. Sousa told Carter he had a file on Whitney Frost for her. Carter took it and tried to convince Sousa to leave; however, he became suspicious at her brush off and moved towards her car, asking Carter what was wrong with Jarvis. Carter explained that Jarvis had drunk too much, though Sousa did not believe her. Sounds came from the car; though Carter tried to claim she had captured a possum, the sounds became words and Sousa learned Hunt was locked in the trunk. 

Carter argues with Daniel Sousa
Carter and Sousa argued about Hunt inside the estate. Carter feigned shock that kidnapping was a felony, as Sousa told her that she should have at least requested backup. Carter told him she wanted to keep him out of this, citing she had messed up his engagement and did not want to mess up the rest of his life. Sousa ignored her, stating he was already involved.

Questioning Rufus Hunt
Carter interrogates Rufus Hunt
Carter and Daniel Sousa questioned Rufus Hunt in a boiler room of Howard Stark's Estate. Hunt refused to negotiate with Sousa as Carter prepared an injection. Carter listened as Hunt told Sousa that he had been tortured by the Japanese during World War II and would not tell him anything. Sousa ceded the interrogation to Carter, who told Hunt she would not torture him. Hunt mocked her, saying there were lines she would not cross. Carter replied that she would not torture Hunt due to a lack of time; injecting Hunt with a substance. Carter claimed that the substance was malaria, and left Hunt to consider his options. Carter and Sousa withdrew; he asked what she had given him and she replied that it was a fast onset cold. Carter asked Sousa if he wanted tea as she waited for Hunt to cave. 

Carter and Daniel Sousa listen to Rufus Hunt
Carter's deception worked and Hunt begged for the antidote, telling Carter and Sousa that the Arena Club was a front for the Council of Nine, a group of influential men he claimed had their fingers in everything from assassinations to bank crashes. Carter asked for names and was shocked by the familiar men. Hunt told Carter that she would never defeat the Council. Carter asked for more information, and Hunt revealed that the Council recorded their meetings and everything she needed was on tapes in the Arena Club. Carter and Sousa left to plan an infiltration.

Carter is desisted by Vernon Masters
Carter and Sousa gathered the SSR agents, ordering them where to enter the club. However, as they planned, they were interrupted by Vernon Masters, who stopped Carter and Sousa, telling the pair that his men were taking over and also auditing their past cases. As Carter complained, Masters revealed he had an order direct from Washington, D.C. Masters told Carter he wished to speak with her in private, and she led him to Sousa's office. Carter listened as Masters complimented her, then interjected, trying to convince Masters to help her take down the Council. Masters acted skeptical and asked for her source; suddenly wary, Carter refused to name Hunt. Masters threatened Carter that though she might survive a coming wave, her coworkers could not. Carter glanced towards Sousa, afraid for him and for herself.

Carter learns Daniel Sousa saved the sample
Carter left the office to block Masters from learning about Hunt; on the way, she was followed by Sousa, who told her he had not expected Masters. Sousa asked what her plan was, but Carter tried to exclude him from her mission. Sousa revealed that Masters had threatened him with the same speech, and showed Carter that he had saved a sample of Jane Scott's body tissue from Masters' search. Carter and Sousa continued to the broom closet and made a plan to release Hunt and let him lead them to Whitney Frost.

Carter watches Rufus Hunt escape
As part of the plan, Sousa removed Hunt's restraints and planted a listening device on him. While Carter watched from a hiding place, Sousa then pretended he was going to lead Hunt away to kill him. Hunt knocked him down and ran off, leaving Sousa on the ground. When Carter emerged, Sousa complained about taking the punch, but Carter told him it was the least he could do since Hunt had strangled her two times already.

Carter tells Jason Wilkes to keep fighting
Carter and Sousa returned to Stark's estate, where she talked to Jason Wilkes as Sousa and Edwin Jarvis listened to Hunt's actions. Wilkes told her that he was having trouble concentrating, though he could not explain why, telling Carter he felt called to let go and follow an impulse. Carter told Wilkes about her brother, Michael, who had always assured Carter that she was meant to fight. Carter told Wilkes that he had to fight and keep going until a cure could be found, lightly touching Wilkes' insubstantial arm.

Carter listens to Rufus Hunt being murdered
Just then, Sousa and Jarvis announced Hunt had reached Frost's house, and Carter moved to hear. She waited, listening, as Frost realized that Hunt had revealed information to Carter and moved closer to him. Carter then heard Hunt scream and his frequency went dead; shocked, she asked what Frost had done to Hunt, but received no answer.

Infiltrating Roxxon
Carter is awoken by Jason Wilkes
Carter was awakened by Jason Wilkes, who asked to show her something. Wilkes brought Carter to the vial of Jane Scott's tissue sample; Carter watched as a drop of Zero Matter exited the sample and tried to reach Wilkes. Suddenly, the droplet broke the container and entered Wilkes' body; to Carter's shock, Wilkes became substantial for a heartbeat, but his eyes became solid black before the effect wore off. 

Carter notices Jason Wilkes is tangible
As she watched, Wilkes turned and told Carter he knew where Scott's body was being held. Carter and Wilkes woke up Edwin Jarvis, who brought a map upon which Wilkes marked a location. Carter called Rose Roberts, who told her that the location was a warehouse owned by Thomas Gloucester. Carter hung up the phone and returned to Wilkes and Jarvis; Wilkes told Carter that Whitney Frost would be trying to reach Scott's body as well. Carter and Jarvis made a plan to infiltrate the warehouse.

Carter and Edwin Jarvis watch Whitney Frost
Carter and Jarvis arrived at the warehouse. Carter unscrewed a grate and climbed inside an air duct, asking Jarvis to follow, though he was reluctant. Crawling through the duct, the two found the room in which Scott's body was being held; as Carter prepared to climb down, she heard voices outside the room and quickly pulled the vent back up. Carter watched as Frost and Calvin Chadwick entered the room. Frost opened the container holding the body and touched Scott's skin; Carter watched as the Zero Matter inside the body entered Frost, who turned to Chadwick and told him that she needed an Atomic Bomb. 

Carter discusses Whitney Frost's plan
Back at Howard Stark's Estate, Carter told Wilkes what Frost had said, hoping that he would know what she was planning. Wilkes did, and told Carter that Frost would try to recreate the Isodyne Energy experiment that brought the Zero Matter in an attempt to get more powerful. Carter listened as Wilkes explained that Frost needed to have the exact same conditions; therefore, she would try to obtain an atomic bomb. Carter realized that the Roxxon Corporation were the makers of the original bomb, but did not know which Roxxon headquarters had the bombs in storage. 

Carter learns that Daniel Sousa is engaged
To her surprise, Jarvis explained that Howard Stark kept close surveillance on Roxxon, and that the headquarters in Los Angeles had the most security, therefore most likely to have the bombs. Jarvis told Carter that she would need an electronic key kept by Hugh Jones; Carter began forming a plan and left to get backup from Daniel Sousa. Carter walked into the middle of an engagement party for Sousa; she congratulated him before telling him of her plan. Sousa agreed to assist her, and Carter asked him to let her use some of the SSR's technology. She and Sousa bribed Aloysius Samberly with pie to allow her access to the Memory Inhibitor; she took the device and left. 

Carter encounters Hugh Jones
Disguising herself in a wig, Carter entered the office of Jones, posing as a girl looking for files for accounting. When Jones entered, she played along with Jones' arrogance, acting ditsy, until he left his office. She then began searching for the key again, only for Jones to recognize her as an agent of the SSR and he returned to report her. Carter was forced to use the Memory Inhibitor on Jones several times, before finally realizing that Jones kept the key in his belt buckle. Reaching it, she left Jones unconscious and returned to the SSR.

Carter with her assembled team
Carter asked Sousa to include Rose Roberts on the infiltration mission. Sousa protested, leading Carter to lecture him as they watched Roberts fight a client in the Auerbach Theatrical Agency. Sousa reluctantly agreed, and the two went to the lab to get technology for the mission. While there, Carter and Sousa were confronted by Samberly, who, angered at the pair using his inventions without permission, refused to allow them access. However, Carter watched as Roberts entered and convinced Samberly to let his inventions on the mission. Carter was relieved, only to have Samberly insist on coming along. She formed a plan to infiltrate the facility using Samberly and his inventions.

The team infiltrate the Roxxon Warehouse
Carter, Sousa, and Jarvis waited in a car outside the Roxxon building while Samberly and Roberts took out the guards. The ruse succeeded and all entered the facility, using the key Carter had stolen from Jones to operate the elevators. Carter warned the others to stay alert; Samberly activated a motion detector to help. Carter watched as Samberly disabled the locks, though she noted that now they had opened the doors for Frost and her men as well as themselves. However, Carter and her team found a room containing the bombs. While Sousa, Jarvis, Samberly, and Roberts stayed behind to work on the bombs, Carter left to confront Frost.

Carter fights Whitney Frost
Carter found Frost in the building arguing with Chadwick. Carter confronted Frost, who was shocked to see her. Carter told Frost that the SSR could fix her; however, Frost rejected Carter's offer, stating she had never been so powerful. Frost moved to grab Carter, but Carter ducked and punched Frost in the face. Carter was surprised to see Frost shake off her hit. Frost reached Carter and began engulfing her with Zero Matter, but Carter managed to break Frost's hold.

Carter is impaled after falling off the ledge
However, due to pushing herself off Frost, Carter fell over a ledge. She managed to hold on to the ledge with one hand, but when Frost leaned over to touch Carter again, Carter released her grip, causing her to fall and be impaled by a steel rod below. Carter was rescued by Sousa, who brought her to his nurse fiance Violet, knowing he could not bring Carter to a hospital. Sousa and Jarvis moved Carter to the couch, where Violet examined her and assured her that the rod had missed all vital organs. 

Carter watches Jason Wilkes vanish
Carter rested on the couch as Sousa stayed near her. Finally, Jarvis brought the car around so Carter could return to Stark's estate. There, Carter lay on her bed as Jarvis told her that adventures were only fun if she returned from them. When Jarvis left, Carter talked with Wilkes again; they turned on the radio and listened to Wilkes' favorite song. However, Wilkes suddenly turned invisible again, to Carter's shock and sadness.

Desperate Measures
Carter and Jason Wilkes discuss his state
Carter called for Jason Wilkes frantically until he finally became visible again; he explained that he was being beckoned into a rift and his grip on this reality was slipping. Carter reminded Wilkes that he was a containment scientist and asked him to build a containment vessel for himself; Wilkes reminded Carter that he had no mass to be contained. Carter remembered that absorbing Zero Matter made Wilkes tangible.

Carter comes up with a bad idea
Carter was in incredible pain as Edwin Jarvis cleaned Carter's abdominal wound; Ana Jarvis watched and saw the severity. Daniel Sousa then came to the estate, looking saddened. Carter explained to him Wilkes' dilemma and her plan to use the Vacuum Syringe to extract a blood sample from Whitney Frost when she attends the Congressional fundraiser Calvin Chadwick was having to which Edwin has two tickets. Carter tried to open a door and ripped her stitches; Sousa cited that Carter was in no position to approach Frost who had just tried to kill her earlier. Sousa could not think of anyone equal to Carter that could accomplish the mission; Carter then said that she had a terrible idea.

Carter visits and recruits Dottie Underwood
Carter, dressed as a doctor, went to Rosemary's, the front that was the prison for Dottie Underwood, and presented herself as "Katherine Wexford", Underwood's psychiatrist. The guard asked "Wexford" if she needed his company since Underwood was a difficult prisoner; she declined the offer. Underwood recognized Carter immediately and wondered why she was there, citing that if she came undercover, she must need her for an assignment as opposed to giving her an interrogation; Underwood also noticed that Carter was in pain, thus fighting in that condition would not be enjoyable. Carter told Underwood that she was there to free her for a mission and would take care of the guard, but she had to run to her right upon escape; Carter then gave Underwood a magnet strong enough to unlock the cell.

Carter watches Dottie Underwood's capture
Carter then used her Sweet Dreams Lipstick on the guard and waited with Sousa outside. As suspected, Underwood ran to her left and found Carter and Sousa waiting for her; Sousa fired a net rifle and a net surrounded Underwood. Underwood asked if they expected that to hold her; Sousa then pressed a button on the side of the rifle, which sent an electrical current through the net, incapacitating Underwood; Carter then sent an extra jolt and smiled as Underwood wiggled.

Prepping Underwood
Carter greets an awake Dottie Underwood
Carter changed the clothes and hairstyle of Dottie Underwood while a necklace was prepared with a tracker and a neurotoxin injector. She was also given a hat with a microphone. When Underwood awakened, Carter greeted her but forgot that the Russian was under a hair dryer, so she could not hear; Carter turned off the dryer and gave Underwood her necklace and explained that if she removed it, she would die in 35 seconds from the neurotoxin.
