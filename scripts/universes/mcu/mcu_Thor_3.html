<html><p>The Dark Elf proceeded to take full advantage of Thor losing his main weapon, knocking him back with the full force of the Aether before standing over the injured Thor as they both then fell through another portal, crash landing onto The Gherkin when they returned to Earth with some force. While falling off the side of the Gherkin, Thor then attempted to draw Mjølnir back into his hand, but he was too late as he fell through another portal while he was still fighting Malekith.

Thor is then teleported onto Jotunheim
While his hammer was then forced to fly through space as fast as it possibly could to try in its determined quest to reach him, Thor and Malekith had then landed on Jotunheim they were both immediately almost killed by a Frost Beast which launched out of a cave and destroyed the section of a mountain they were stood on, causing them to fall through yet another portal with the Beast as well, which had also trapped the Beast on Earth where he attacked the Elves.

Thor takes the train back to the battlefield
Having gotten away from the Frost Beast which saved Darcy Lewis and Ian Boothby from Dark Elves, Thor and Malekith were teleported to separate parts of London, as Thor was forced to use the London Underground System to make his way back towards Greenwich. Thor quickly asked the highly confused passengers the best way for him to get back to the battle, and smiling to himself when an attractive woman had then awkwardly fallen on him.

Destroying Malekith
Thor finds Jane Foster and Erik Selvig
Now that Malekith was back on Earth and next to the Ark, he then started to release the Aether's power into the Nine Realms through the Convergence. Thor returned to Greenwich and regrouped with Jane Foster and Selvig as they all watched as the Aether's power was being unleashed. They told him that neither of them could get close to Malekith as the Aether would tear their bodies apart, but Thor could, so he took the Gravimetric Spikes and had then moved forward.

Thor demands that Malekith surrender to him
With the Spikes in his hands, Thor moved through the Aether and found Malekith in the center, pushing it's power through the Nine Realms and plunging them into eternal darkness. Thor called out to Malekith, telling him he was there to accept his surrender, as he had said to the Kronan Marauder, and threw the Spikes into Malekith's arms, teleporting them to Svartalfheim, although Malekith merely used the Aether's power to regrow his own arms back.

Thor prepares to finally destroy Malekith
Fueled by the Aether, Malekith told Thor that he now could not be stopped and the Aether could not be destroyed, only for Thor to not that Malekith himself could be destroyed before charging forward. Powered by a desire to avenge the Sacking of Asgard and the death of Frigga as well as Loki, Thor then reclaimed Mjølnir and struck the last Spike into Malekith's chest, knocking him back into the Ark with incredible force and teleporting him onto Svartalfheim.

Thor is saved just in time by Erik Selvig
While the threat of Malekith was temporally over, the impact of the blast combined with the Aether, knocked Thor unconscious. As Foster ran to his aid, Malekith's ship started to fall down towards their heads, with Foster unable to pull Thor to safety. Fortunately, Erik Selvig's devices teleported the ship away and it crashed down on Malekith, finally killing him. Meanwhile, Thor awoke to find he had succeeded in defeating Malekith and all the Dark Elves.

Rejecting the Throne
Thor taking down his knee before King Odin
With Malekith and the Dark Elves now finally defeated, Thor returned back onto Asgard and talked with his father about the recent events. He spoke about Loki's sacrifice and how he now believed his brother had died a hero by sacrificing himself to kill Kurse. He then explained his desire to return back to Earth and be with Jane Foster, and had then renounced his claim to the throne of Asgard.

Thor leaves Asgard to return to back Earth
Still promising to protect the Nine Realms from any future dangers with his last and every breath, Thor noted how the sacrifices of such a life changed the man who would become the king. Seeking to then make a statement, Thor then offered Odin Mjølnir which he refused before wishing Thor good luck in his new search for love with Foster. Unknown to him, Loki was still alive as he sat down on the throne, masquerading as Odin. Thor then returned back to Earth and reunited back with Foster.

Thor and Jane Foster are back together again
Soon after the battles, when S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Phil Coulson and his team were investigating the discovery of a lost Asgardian artifact known as the Berserker Staff, he sought to consult with Thor, but was informed by S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury that Thor had taken himself "off the grid." Coulson told Sif, when she came to Earth chasing Lorelei, not to inform Thor of his survival and that it would be better if he told Thor himself that he was still alive.

Avengers Reassembled
Attack on the HYDRA Base
Thor arrives at the location of the Scepter
With the rising threat of HYDRA, the Avengers were reassembled and used the Avengers Tower as their headquarters to embark on several missions to ruin all HYDRA's plans for world domination. Thor was called upon to assist Black Widow in a situation in Sudan. Thor and his teammates fought against HYDRA and Jensen and defeated the HYDRA soldiers. With the assistance of Phil Coulson and S.H.I.E.L.D., Thor and the Avengers located Loki's Scepter at a HYDRA base in Sokovia where it was creating enhanced soldiers.

Thor battles Wolfgang von Strucker's soldiers
While searching for the Scepter in the HYDRA Research Base, Thor and the Avengers battled countless HYDRA operatives with highly advanced weapons and armor designed from Chitauri technology gathered from the Battle of New York. When Iron Man discovered that the base was protected by an energy shield, Thor noted that HYDRA would not have built such powerful technology and defenses without the use of the Scepter's incredible alien power.

Thor agrees to leave and rescue Hawkeye
The Avengers were soon attacked by Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, who had gained powers from HYDRA's experiments. Hawkeye was injured during this attack and Thor offered to get him back to safety. Thor and Captain America used their combined strength to destroy a HYDRA Tank before Thor saved Hawkeye. Eventually, the Avengers located the Scepter, captured Wolfgang von Strucker and HYDRA was finally defeated, although the Maximoff twins escaped.

Thor tells Bruce Banner of Hulk's violence
Once the team was back on the Quinjet, Natasha Romanoff asked Thor for an assessment of Bruce Banner's skills on the battlefield to help him calm down; however, the overly excited Thor commented on how Hulk's violence had just resulted in the deaths of dozens of HYDRA soldiers who were now screaming in Hel. Seeing that this upset Banner, Thor took back his words and told him that many of the injuries he had inflicted on the soldiers were nonfatal.

Thor agrees to give Tony Stark the Scepter
While they looked at the Scepter and discussed how they had been hunting it ever since the HYDRA Uprising and how List had used it to make enhanced soldiers, Stark asked Thor to allow him to analyze the Scepter before Thor took it back to Asgard and, seeing no real threat there, Thor agreed. Stark then suggested that the Avengers hold a party at Avengers Tower to celebrate their victory over Baron Strucker to which both Thor and Steve Rogers agreed.

Avengers Celebration
Thor compares Jane Foster and Pepper Potts
Thor attended a party at Avengers Tower to celebrate their victory over HYDRA and the capture of the Scepter. Thor listened to James Rhodes' unimpressive war stories about lifting a tank and joked with Tony Stark about whether Jane Foster was a more impressive girlfriend than Pepper Potts, comparing their careers much to Maria Hill's amusement.

Thor drinks with Steve Rogers during a party
Later, Thor decided to drink an Asgardian drink he brought with him, stating it had been aged thousands of years to perfect the taste. He shared some with Steve Rogers, who was unable to get drunk from any alcohol on earth due to the Super Soldier Serum boosting his immune system. An an old veteran demanded a taste of the liquor, but Thor warned that no normal man could handle the drink. Despite Thor's warnings, the man insisted that he was strong enough due to his time in World War II, and was later escorted home, barely able to stand. Thor then remained at the party while many of the other guests left the party.

Thor witnesses Rogers almost lift Mjølnir
The party came to an end and all of the guests returned home except for the Avengers. As they sat and drank, Thor was challenged on the legitimacy of Mjølnir by Clint Barton, who thought it could be lifted by anyone. Thor then invited Barton to try and lift it, so he accepted, but ultimately failed. The others then also attempted to lift Mjølnir, including Tony Stark with the help of James Rhodes and their gauntlets, as well as Bruce Banner who pretending to Hulk out.

Thor jokingly calls of the Avengers unworthy
Only Steve Rogers was able to move Mjølnir slightly, which made Thor nervous, but Rogers soon admitted defeat, although, from then on, Thor remained suspicious of him being worthy, which he actually was. Stark claimed that the hammer was actually imprinted and it was not Asgardian magic that held the key. When all the Avengers who had attempted had failed, Thor implied that it was simply because they were actually unworthy, much to everyone's disgust while they all still laughed together.

Ultron Offensive
Attack on Avengers Tower
Thor sees Ultron's damaged body
Suddenly, a loud noise rang in the team's ear as they were greeted by a heavily damaged Iron Legion drone that accused them all of being killers. The robot claimed that while awakening from sleep, it had killed somebody, but when Captain America questioned who, the robot did not answer. When Thor asked the drone who sent him, the robot only replied by replaying an audio tape of something Tony Stark had said revealing himself as Ultron, an artificial intelligent android created by Stark with Bruce Banner's help, designed to safeguard all of humanity.

Thor battles the Ultron Sentries
Ultron told the Avengers that he was on a mission to bring peace and then attacked the entire group using the Iron Legion which he had reprogrammed to be his own army of Ultron Sentries. The Avengers battled against the army, with Thor using his strength to rip apart the robots with his bare hands. In the ensuing conflict, one of the drones stole the Scepter and flew away from Avengers Tower before any of the team could stop it from getting away from them.

Thor destroys Ultron's first main body
Eventually, the drones were all destroyed by the combined efforts of the Avengers, with Ultron commenting that it had been a dramatic few moments. When Ultron told them that the only way to ensure peace was to destroy the Avengers, Thor then responded by angrily throwing Mjølnir at the robot, destroying his body only for Ultron to download his body to another area while singing a song from Pinocchio as his current body then shut down.

Argument
Thor angrily confronting Tony Stark
While the Avengers regrouped and tried to figure out their next move, Thor was sent after the Iron Legion robot who had escaped with the Scepter, although Thor was unable to follow it too far and had only learned it was going north. Having returned back to Avengers Tower, the now infuriated Thor grabbed Tony Stark by the throat blaming him for the mess, before being calmed down by Steve Rogers who then demanded an update on what Thor had learned.

Thor questions how they'll find Ultron
Thor noted that now he could no longer return the Scepter back to Asgard as was planned, blaming Stark for creating Ultron, noting that the entire situation could have been avoided if he had not toyed with the power of the Scepter, an object unknown to him, Stark defended his decision to create the robotic A.I. by claiming that while they could deal with forces such as HYDRA and arms dealers with ease, beings like the Chitauri were beyond all their own powers.

Thor and the Avengers discuss Ulysses Klaue
Seeking to work out where Ultron would have gone, the Avengers soon learned that Wolfgang von Strucker had been killed by the robot and so they began researching what Strucker may have told him. Eventually, they came to the conclusion that Ultron would be seeking out Ulysses Klaue, who could sell him vibranium. Looking at his picture, Thor noted that Klaue had a brand burned onto his neck written in Wakandan which showed him to be a thief.

Battle at the Salvage Yard
Thor attempts to find peace with Ultron
The Avengers eventually managed to locate Ultron purchasing a new supply of vibranium from arms-dealer Ulysses Klaue while within the city of Johannesburg. The Avengers arrived just as Ultron attacked Klaue after being insulted. Thor and the other Avengers confronted Ultron and his companions, Wanda and her brother Pietro Maximoff. Thor spoke with Ultron, trying to convince him to be peaceful but was ignored.

Thor attacks an Ultron Sentry
Despite all their attempts to resolve the conflict, it soon became clear that Ultron had no intention of keeping the peace, the teams began fighting, with Hawkeye and Black Widow fighting all Klaue's soldiers while the others battled the Ultron Sentries. While Ultron fought against Iron Man, Thor assisted Captain America in the battle against the robots and Maximoffs, using teamwork to gain the upper hand and soon destroyed Ultron's small robotic army.

Thor is given a vision by the Scarlet Witch
As their battle neared its end and the Avengers seemed victorious, Wanda Maximoff snuck up behind Thor and used her own abilities to warp his mind before attacking all the other Avengers. Although he initially believed he was too mighty to be affected and warned his other teammates, Thor soon seemingly found himself in Asgard, at which point he realized Maximoff's power was stronger than he had anticipated as it had managed to affect his own mind.

Thor has a vision of Asgard's destruction
Thor continued to suffer from visions of the citizens of Asgard dying in some kind of a war which seemed to involve the Infinity Stones. He was confronted by the ghostly figure of Heimdall who blamed him for killing them all while a mysterious hooded figure watched while Thor fired bolts of destructive lightning from his body, getting flashes of the creation of Vision and the Infinity Gauntlet which would one day house all of the Infinity Stones and bring destruction.

Thor considers the Scarlet Witch's vision
Still suffering from the effects along with the rest of the team, Thor was forced to make a quick escape to the Quinjet to recover his mind while Iron Man was forced to stop Hulk's current destructive rampage through Johannesburg, as Bruce Banner was also affected by Wanda Maximoff's powers. While onboard the Quinjet, the unaffected Barton updated Maria Hill and explained he would take the team somewhere safe where they could all recover.

Water of Sights
Thor and Steve Rogers at Clint Barton's home
In order to get the Avengers out of harm's way, Clint Barton piloted the Quinjet to a remote location. With Thor, Captain America and Black Widow suffering from visions and Tony Stark and Bruce Banner recovering from a massive fight they had had right in the center of Johannesburg, Barton flew the Quinjet to the only place he knew they would all be safe, his home. Barton then introduced all the Avengers to his family, including his pregnant wife Laura Barton and his two children.

Thor leaves in order to find answers to seeks
While Barton was explaining how he had asked Nick Fury to keep the location of the farm off all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s official records, Thor then accidentally stepped on one of the Cooper Barton's toys and hid the broken pieces under the table. Still struggling with the vision Scarlet Witch had given him, Thor chose not to stay at the house and then informed Rogers and Stark that he would go to learn more about the Infinity Stones and the being he had seen in his vision.

Thor asks for Doctor Erik Selvig's help
Wanting not to draw any attention to himself, Thor put on a hooded jacket and found Doctor Erik Selvig outside the University of London where he was currently teaching. Greeting Selvig beside his car, Thor asked for his assistance for finding the "Water of Sights." Selvig happily agreed despite Thor's warnings that it could prove to be dangerous, with Selvig noting that he would be disappointed if the mission was not dangerous as he got into the car.

Thor and Selvig arrive at the Water of Sights
Upon finding the Water of Sights with Selvig's help, Thor explained that throughout the Nine Realms there were reflections and, if he was accepted by the water gods, then he would be able to return to his dream and find the answers he needed, although Selvig warned that none of the stories involving this place ended well. Despite all the warnings, Thor undressed and entered the pool and the water spirits allowed him to revisit his previous nightmare in more detail.

Thor gets a new vision in the Water of Sights
Thor's body was taken over by the water spirits who claimed only a human sacrifice would stop Ultron and noting that the Scepter would be key. Thor became engulfed with lightning and saw nightmarish visions of the destruction of Asgard and the deaths of all of his close friends including Heimdall. He also saw strange visions of the Infinity Stones and the birth of a new being which could help them destroy Ultron. With all this new information, Thor flew back to the Avengers Tower to inform the rest of the team of what he had learned.

Birth of Vision
Thor uses lightning to create Vision
As Thor was on his way back from London, the other Avengers all argued over the uploading of J.A.R.V.I.S. into an android body made by Ultron using the Mind Stone. This led to a fight between the team. As this was happening, Thor arrived and cast a bolt of lightning at the machine that contained the android. The android, now sentient, released himself from the container, knocking Thor back with incredible force.

Thor witnesses Vision coming to life
Confused about his surroundings in Avengers Tower as he glanced all around, the being's gaze immediately focused on Thor. He leaped towards him, planning to attack. Thor was able to counter by tossing him out a glass window, but the being was able to stop himself in mid-air as he looked out at New York City. The being then took the time to examine himself on the reflection of the glass window while also gazing out into the city, considering what happened.

Thor explains why he helped make Vision
While Thor stopped all of the Avengers from attacking it, the being apologized for its own actions and then offered his gratitude to Thor before taking a similar appearance to the God of Thunder's outfit, mainly the cape and gauntlets. Thor explained that he witnessed a vision where the Earth will be destroyed, given to him by Scarlet Witch, and at the center of it is the Infinity Stones, including the Mind Stone, which is implanted on the android's forehead.

Thor and Vision discuss stopping Ultron
Despite what Thor said, Captain America, confused as to why the android sounded like J.A.R.V.I.S., allowed Tony Stark to explain that he reconfigured his matrix to create "something new." The android, eventually going by the name of Vision, stated that he was not a child of Ultron, Ultron himself, or J.A.R.V.I.S.; he was his own entity entirely who was there to assist them in finding a way of stopping Ultron's evil plans to soon destroy the entire human race.

Thor is casually handed back Mjølnir by Vision
The Avengers, along with the Maximoff twins, remained skeptical as to which side Vision was on; the android explained that he was on the side of life while Ultron was not, and then went on to say that Ultron would be currently waiting for all of the Avengers, especially his own creator Tony Stark, in Sokovia. He stated that Ultron would spread his rage across the globe before handing Mjølnir back to Thor, much to the bewilderment of everyone in the room.

Thor speaks with Vision before the mission
As they all prepared for the incoming Battle of Sokovia, Thor took some time to speak with Vision while all of the other Avengers collected their gear and regrouped onboard the Quinjet to fly to Ultron's location at Novi Grad. During the flight, Captain America gave a speech in which he told his fellow Avengers that their priority would be to get the people of Sokovia to safety before battling all the Ultron Sentries that would be standing in their way.

Battle of Sokovia
Battling the Ultron Sentries
Thor witnesses Ultron attacking Sokovia
Thor joined the rest of the Avengers going to Sokovia, while Captain America organized the evacuation of all of the civilians before any fighting could put them at risk, Thor assisted Bruce Banner in the rescue of Natasha Romanoff, as she had been captured by Ultron, smashing down a wall to give Banner access to the building where she was held.

Thor realizes Novi Grad is being risen up
Once Romanoff had been found and rescued, she forced Banner to turn into Hulk before they rejoined the rest of the team into the battle against all the Ultron Sentries, who had been alerted to the team's presence. Thor remained behind, witnessing the city being torn apart from the inside as Ultron Sentries attempted to overwhelm the God of Thunder, who responded by easily destroying his robotic enemies before searching for the rest of the Avengers.

Thor and Captain America fight in Sokovia
Ultron then unveiled his master plan, using a device to lift the city of Novi Grad high into the sky, planning to drop it onto the earth and cause a massive explosion which would destroy much of the world and kill everyone on it, leaving only Ultron and his entire army. Thor assisted Captain America when he attempted to save a woman in a car from falling to her death, as she became trapped on the edge of the city when it into the sky. Due to Rogers being unable to reach her in time, Thor flew down after her and then managed to throw her to Rogers, who lifted her to safety. At the same time, Thor managed to grab another falling car and drop it back onto the city.

Thor battles against all the Ultron Sentries
Teaming up with Captain America, they both used Thor's hammer to send Captain America's Shield flying into a horde of the Ultron Sentries, destroying several of them. Thor grabbed another of the Sentries and flew him into the air, before spinning and knocking several more out of the sky and smashing them apart, causing one to crash land into a petrol van and cause a massive fireball which then destroyed even more of the enemy machines.

Thor is beaten into submission by Ultron
As the battle against the Ultron Sentries became more intense, Thor was proving himself the superior fighter until he was then attacked by Ultron himself, who now with his new vibranium body, the metal warmonger then proceeded to beat the God of Thunder into submission, eventually causing him to drop Mjølnir. Ultron proceeded to use his Gravity Manipulation capabilities to launch large stone pillars at Thor repeatedly to gain the upper hand in their battle.

Thor is beaten and strangled by Ultron
However, noticing that Vision had arrived, Thor distracted Ultron with an overdrawn speech claiming that as the first son of Odin and also prince of Asgard he would never surrender, before Vision then used Mjølnir to hit Ultron out of the church with incredible force, allowing Thor to get back on his feet. Vision then handed the hammer back to Thor and they briefly discussed its great balance, with Thor noting that this helped him get a better swing from the hammer.

Protecting the Key
Thor shouts toward Ultron
Having found the Key which Ultron would use to drop the city onto the Earth, Thor gathered with the rest of the Avengers to protect the key and ensure Ultron was unable to get close to it. As Ultron hovered above them, Thor roared at him, asking if this was the best he could do.

Thor battles against Ultron's entire army
Ultron responded by unleashing his entire army of Ultron Sentries to attack the Avengers. Captain America slowly turned to Thor and commented that Thor had to provoke the warmongering A.I. before they prepared for their last stand. Ultron sent in his army and the Avengers put all their might into keeping him away from the key, ripping apart hundreds of his clones in the ensuing battle, with Thor summoning lightning from Mjølnir to blast the robots apart.

Thor almost destroys Ultron's armored body
As the Avengers gained the upper hand in the battle against the seemingly never-ending army of Ultron Sentries, Ultron himself was knocked outside and Thor joined Vision and Iron Man in using his lightning and energy blasts to damage and melt Ultron's Vibranium armor. With Ultron now too weak to stand, he attempted to reason with the Avengers, but before he could Hulk appeared and punched him so hard he flew across the city and away from them.

Thor listens to Captain America's new orders
As all the other Ultron Sentries made a hasty retreat away from the Avengers and were destroyed by War Machine and Vision, Thor stayed with the other Avengers as Captain America ordered them to make their way out once the last of the citizens had been evacuated onboard the Lifeboats, which were being sent by Nick Fury and Maria Hill from onboard the Helicarrier. Thor joined the others in helping get the people on board the Helicarrier while the Scarlet Witch volunteered to stay behind and keep guarding the key against Ultron.

Destroying the City
Thor agrees to stay behind to destroy the key
With most of the Ultron Sentries destroyed, Thor returned to Captain America and observed as the final citizens of Novi Grad were loaded onto the Lifeboats ships to be taken to safety on the Helicarrier. As they watched the people taken to safety, Iron Man worked out a plan to destroy the city, at the risk of his and Thor's deaths, but neither showed any hesitation if it meant stopping Ultron's plans to kill all life on Earth.

Thor and Rogers are both shot at by Ultron
Without warning, Ultron fired a barrage of bullets at the pair from the Quinjet he had stolen, as both Thor and Captain America shielded themselves from the bullets. Ultron then turned his sights towards Hawkeye, who was attempting to save Costel from harm. before the other Avengers could stop him, Ultron killed Quicksilver by shooting him, as he had run in front of Hawkeye to protect him. Thor then charged forward to finally complete their mission plan.

Thor uses his lightning to destroy the Key
In a final desperate attempt to destroy all human life, Ultron finally managed to activate the key and began the process of dropping Novi Grad onto Earth. With seemingly no other alternative, Thor and Iron Man flew into the machine itself and in an attempt to destroy it, Iron Man capped the internal engine to double back the energy wave going to be unleashed, as Thor held Mjølnir over the key, charging it with lightning and waited until Iron Man gave him the order.

Thor survives the destruction of Sokovia
Once Iron Man had used his Arc Reactor beam to overheat the city's core, Thor then smashed his hammer onto the key, channeling the massive amounts of lightning into the vibranium causing a massive smite that vaporized the entire city before it could hit the ground, saving billions of lives in the process. Thor was caught in the middle of the explosion and fell down hundreds of feet into the sea below, however, his Asgardian body helped him to survive the blast.

Farewell to the Avengers
Thor speaks to Steve Rogers and Tony Stark
With Ultron finally defeated, and the world once again saved from its total annihilation, Thor regrouped with all of his fellow Avengers at the New Avengers Facility where the newest generation of the Avengers was being trained to protect the planet. While having a friendly debate with Steve Rogers and Tony Stark over how Vision had become worthy enough to pick up Mjølnir while the others could not, Thor decided to leave Earth in the safe hands of the new Avengers.

Thor says his own goodbyes to the Avengers
Still haunted by the visions Scarlet Witch had shown him, Thor felt it was his duty as a hero between the Nine Realms to better research and understand all the Infinity Stones, realizing that someone was behind the scenes, manipulating events, since four of the six Infinity Stones have been recently involved in major events, recalling how he had witnessed Malekith using the Aether's power recently. Telling Stark and Rogers that he will eventually return, Thor called Heimdall to summon the Bifrost Bridge and returned to Asgard to begin his mission, leaving before Stark complained about how these gateways he created ruined their facility's lawn by burning a lot of it.

Futile Search
Thor is captured and held within Muspelheim
Having spent two years following the Battle of Sokovia, searching for the Infinity Stones, Thor had been unsuccessful in finding any. During this time, Thor had begun to have dreams of Asgard up in flames with the Fire Demon Surtur at the center of all the destruction, prompting the God of Thunder to travel to Muspelheim, where he had then allowed himself to be captured by Surtur in his search for an explanation for all of these horrific dreams of Asgard's destruction.

Thor is chained up and brought before Surtur
Having recounted his life story to a skeleton who was sharing his cell, Thor was granted an audience with Surtur himself, as Thor was then dropped from his cell and left dangling by a chain before the lord of the Fire Demons. While Thor noted that he thought Odin had killed Surtur half a million years ago, Surtur explained that he could not die until he had destroyed Asgard, to which Thor then explained his dreams of seeing Asgard up in flames at the hands of Surtur.

Thor learns Surtur's plan to unleash Ragnarök
Surtur explained that these were visions of Ragnarök, promising Thor that once his Crown of Surtur had then finally been reunited back with the Eternal Flame then he could destroy all of Asgard, although Thor kept interrupting Surtur as his chain spun him around. In trading banter with the Fire Demon over his schemes of destruction and his crown, Thor had also learned from Surtur that Thor's father Odin is no longer on Asgard, confirming his fears that something was wrong.

Thor battles against the army of Fire Demons
Once he got Surtur to foolish reveal his own schemes, Thor had then continued mocking him before summoning Mjølnir and easily busted out of his chains, although he struggled to get his timing quite right. While Surtur insisted that Thor had made a terrible mistake in coming into Muspelheim in the first place to challenge him, Thor had still just confidently insisted that he made terrible mistakes constantly, yet they always seemed to work out in his own favor in the long run.

Thor fighting against Surtur's powerful attacks
Despite the seemingly overwhelming hordes of the Fire Demons that were sent to destroy him, Thor's Asgardian strength combined with the power of Mjølnir had given him a clear advantage in the ensuing battle. In the ensuing battle, Thor used Mjølnir to destroy Surtur's demons before blocking an attack from the Twilight Sword. Gaining the upper hand, Thor then overpowered Surtur before successfully knocking the crown off his head, finally vanquishing Surtur.

Thor attempts to call Heimdall for an escape
With Surtur now defeated, Thor then strapped the crown to his back, before attempting to summon the Bifrost Bridge, but for an unknown reason, Heimdall did not answer his call for an exit. With more of the Fire Demons attacking him, Thor flew to the surface of Muspelheim and attempted to call Heimdall again, still getting no answer, which left Thor stranded with no way out before a Fire Dragon had attacked him, with Thor using Mjølnir to trap the Dragon momentarily.

Thor is forced to flee from the Fire Dragon
With limited time left to make his escape, Thor soon found himself forced to go on the run from the Fire Dragon as well as the remaining hordes of Surtur's Fire Demons. Thor had reclaimed Mjølnir and flew away from the immediate danger of the battle, with the Dragon still chasing him down, however, just before the beast could catch up with him, the Bifrost Bridge had finally opened, taking Thor and the beast's head with it back to the safety of Asgard.

Exposing Loki
Thor finally making his return into Asgard
Upon exiting the Bifrost Bridge, Thor slid across the floor at speed due to being pulled from Muspelheim while still flying through the air at considerable speed, being closely followed by the now severed head of the Fire Dragon who had been chasing him. Once arriving there, Thor discovered that Skurge, who had previously fought alongside Thor during the Battle of Vanaheim, had recently been named the new guardian of the Bifrost, with Skurge, complained about Thor scaring away his dates due to the severed dragon head.

Thor and Skurge discussing Heimdall's exile
While Thor questioned what had happened while he had been gone, Skurge had then explained that Heimdall was currently on a fugitive following his exile from Asgard due to him seemingly being declared a traitor, much to Thor's confusion as he knew Heimdall would never betray Asgard. Wishing to investigate what was going on, Thor then flew straight towards Asgard, much to Skurge's annoyance since he was supposed to be the one to announce Thor's arrival first.

Thor witnesses a play about Loki's demise
Upon arriving at the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf, Thor notices a gigantic golden statue of Loki outside, and he then came across "Odin" as he watched a play entitled The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard loosely based on the events that took place in the Second Battle of Svartalfheim, as Loki had apparently died heroically in Thor's arms, having given his life to defeat Malekith and Kurse, presenting Loki as the savior and ignoring all his many previous villainous actions throughout Loki's life.

Thor suspecting that Odin is Loki in disguise
Infuriated, Thor confronted Odin and presented him with the Crown of Surtur, which Odin mistakenly called the Skull of Surtur. Thor then questioned Odin on why he left the Nine Realms defenseless and instead was gorging himself on grapes and leaving Asgard corrupted and defenseless. Realizing from what Surtur had said to him, that his adopted brother had faked his death again, and had been posing as his father since his apparent death in order to claim the throne.

Thor holds Loki until Mjølnir comes back
Seeking to force his brother into revealing his depiction in front of all the onlooking Asgardians, Thor then aggressively took "Odin" in his arms before hurling Mjølnir through the air, threatening to crush his head with it unless he revealed his deception to everyone on Asgard. While the Einherjar watched on, unsure of how to handle the unusual situation, "Odin" tried to insist that Thor was mad and would be executed, but Thor promised to see him in the afterlife, directly addressing "Odin" as his brother.

Thor demanding Loki confess where Odin is
With no other option, Loki finally gave up the facade in front of all the Asgardians and faced Thor's scorn. As they stood awkwardly across from each other, Skurge finally arrived and announced Thor's arrival, much to Loki's annoyance. Thor then demanded to know where Odin had been for the last four years, pressing Mjølnir against Loki until he admitted Odin was on Earth. Thor and Loki then went to Earth, leaving Volstagg and Fandral in charge of the Bifrost.

Upon knocking on the door of the Sanctum, Thor found that he was immediately teleported inside the building where he began looking around. Thor was then eventually met by Doctor Strange who floating down using the Cloak of Levitation and had greeted Thor. Strange then invited Thor to put down Mjølnir, which had been transformed into an umbrella for his time on the Earth, with Strange providing him with a coat stand to place Mjølnir in as Thor obliged him.

Thor learning of the Masters of the Mystic Arts
Upon being teleported around the Sanctum again, Thor commented on his surprise to learn that the Earth now had wizards, with Strange correcting him that they preferred to use the term of the Masters of the Mystic Arts. While they were speaking, Thor awkwardly broke an artifact before questioning what Strange wanted and why he should care, to which Strange introduced himself properly and invited Thor to have a seat while they then discussed Thor returning to Earth.

Thor and Doctor Strange have a discussion
Thor and Strange then teleported across the Sanctum and sat down to discuss the situation that had arisen due to Thor returning to the Earth. Strange also used his magic to give Thor a cup of tea and when he explained that he did not drink tea, Strange gave him a beer instead and began comically refilling Thor's beer as he had drunk it, confusing him. Strange then explained that he kept a watch list of the beings he had deemed dangerous, noting that Loki was one.

Thor requesting Doctor Strange's assistance
Thor remarked that he agreed with Loki being put on the list of the dangerous beings before then being questioned as to why he had brought Loki back to New York City. Thor highlights that he and Loki were currently looking for Odin while Strange agreed to help on the condition that they promptly return to Asgard as soon as they found Odin. Strange explained that Odin was currently in Norway and agreed to help then, noting Odin had wished to remain in exile.

Thor and Doctor Strange both locate Odin
As Strange prepared to use his Sling Ring to teleport Thor to Odin's current location, he briefly checked to see if he needed to alter the spell to accommodate for transporting Asgardians, which he soon confirmed he did not, while continuing to teleport Thor across the building repeatedly, much to his considerable annoyance. Strange then used a strand of Thor's hair to locate Odin in Norway, informed Thor, and that he was currently waiting for them both there.

Thor is shown the portal leading to Norway
He opens up a portal to Norway and comically reminds Thor not to forget his umbrella, to which Thor responded to by summoning it with his hand, smashing through and breaking objects in the room above, which irritated Strange. Thor then requested for Strange to reunite him with Loki, and Strange obliged by using his Sling Ring to open a portal, releasing Loki from a spell which he angrily exclaimed had caused him to fall for thirty minutes, which amused Thor.

Thor and Loki are swiftly teleported away
While Thor shook hands with Strange and thanked him for all of his assistance in locating Odin, the furious Loki then prepared to attack Strange in revenge for falling through the portal for so long. Thor attempted to get his brother to relax, but Strange merely ended the confrontation by moving the still-open portal around Thor and Loki, transporting them to Norway and out of the New York Sanctum before the Loki could get anywhere even close to him.

Odin's Farewell
Thor and Loki soon find Odin standing alone
Having just been sent through Doctor Strange's portal, Thor arrived within Norway alongside Loki and soon discovered Odin as he was looking over a mountainside. Upon seeing their father, Thor immediately told Odin that they have come to take him back to Asgard. Odin only responded with how joyful he is to be reunited with both of his two sons and stated how beautiful the landscape was.

Thor and Loki are reunited back with Odin
As Thor demanded Loki lift his magic, Odin confirmed that it was not Loki's spells that had weakened him, stating that it took him a long time to break free of Loki's illusion and that Frigga would have been proud of him, shocking Loki. Odin told his sons to admire the beauty of the landscape and the sea in front of him, reminiscing of Asgard. As Odin explained that Ragnarök was upon them, Thor told his father that he had defeated Surtur and put an end to Ragnarök.

Thor and Loki witness the passing of Odin
Odin, however, had explained that Ragnarök would not be started by Surtur, but the arrival of Hela, noting that his own life was the only thing holding Hela back. Odin explained that Hela was, in fact, Thor's first-born sister who had been imprisoned within Hel for thousands of years due to her violent needs. While Odin considered this shocking news, Odin told Thor and Loki that he loved them both as his body dissipated into energy and was taken away by the wind.

Thor bitterly blames Loki for Odin's passing
Having witnessed the death of his father and having learned Odin's secrets regarding Hela, Thor's grief and anger caused storm clouds to gather above, as he claimed that this was Loki's fault, as it had been Loki's actions with banishing Odin to Earth without any of his Asgardian powers which had led to Odin's body dying of his long life. While lightning came out of Thor's fingertips as his anger grew, Loki fearfully had then attempted to calm him back down.

Return of Hela
Family Reunion
Thor and Loki meeting Hela for the first time
Before Thor caused an outburst of grief, he and Loki are stunned to see a portal from Hel appear directly in front of them. Changing back into their normal attire, they readied themselves witnessing Hela step out of the portal free of her banishment following Odin's demise. Hela then greeted the pair and expressed her disappointment with not witnessing Odin's passing herself before Thor introduced himself to his sister as Odin's son.

Thor witnesses Hela destroying Mjølnir
Hela commented that while Thor did not look like Odin, Loki sounded more like him. Hela then calmly ordered both Thor and Loki to kneel before her as their new Queen of Asgard. However, Thor had refused to recognize her as the heir to the throne and, seeking to end the first before it started, proceeded to throw Mjølnir towards her. However, much to Thor's complete horror, Hela caught Mjølnir in her hand and then proceeded to completely destroy the hammer with ease.

Thor attempting to battle against Hela
As Hela armed herself with Necroswords and prepared to attack the brothers, Loki panicked and had called for the Bifrost Bridge, much to Thor's horror, who ordered Loki not to do it as it would cause Hela to be able to access Asgard through the Bifrost. As Volstagg obeyed the order and opened the Bifrost, during their transport, Hela then intercepted them and had then forced both Thor and Loki out of the beam, separating the pair while she made it to Asgard.

Stranded on Sakaar
Thor becomes stranded on the planet of Sakaar
Following his brief clash against Hela, Thor was violently thrown out of the Bifrost Bridge and deposited onto the planet of Sakaar which was completely covered in junk. As Thor overlooked the planet, he discovered that there were portals from all of the Nine Realms across the sky, where large amounts of junk and debris from worlds fell through to the surface.

Thor is attacked by the Sakaaran scavengers
While he continued exploring the wasteland of the planet, Thor was then approached by hostile Sakaarans who questioned if Thor was either a fighter or food. As the scavengers moved towards him, Thor attempted to call Mjølnir, only to remember that Hela destroyed it. While Thor fought off the Sakaarans, with his Asgardian strength overpowering them, the Lead Scrapper managed to capture him by using an electrified net which knocked Thor down to the ground.

Thor is electrocuted and captured by Valkyrie
The scavengers proceed to beat Thor until a drunk woman appeared from her Warsong, claiming Thor to be hers before falling off her ship. Although the scrappers tried to ignore her, the woman proceeded to use the Warsong’s guns and slaughtered the scavengers, seemingly rescuing Thor. However, just as Thor had attempted to thank her, the woman threw a Obedience Disk onto his neck and this allowed her to simply electrocute and render Thor completely unconscious.

Thor is taken into custody by Valkyrie
Thor had eventually regained consciousness and found himself flying across the planet still onboard the Warsong while the drunk woman informed somebody that she was on her way. Thor had demanded to know who she was and where he was being taken, smashing at the glass and proclaiming himself to be the son of Odin and insisting that he had to get back onto Asgard. However, the woman simply ignored Thor's demands and then reactivated the Obedience Disk.

Meeting Grandmaster
Thor being brought to meet Grandmaster
With the Obedience Disk connected to his neck still preventing him from escaping, the drunk woman took Thor to meet Sakaar's supreme ruler, Grandmaster. At first, Thor was given a presentation which explained the history of both the Contest of Champions and Grandmaster. As the presentation sped up, Thor awkwardly yelled out loud before awaking before Grandmaster himself.

Thor shows his strength to Grandmaster
While Thor struggled to break free, Grandmaster had Topaz pay the woman, as Grandmaster intended to use Thor as a gladiator in the Contest of Champions. While Grandmaster got closer to Thor, he refused to be sold and ripped off his handcuffs, only for the woman to reactivate his Obedience Disk. When asked who he was, Thor ripped off his handcuffs once again and proclaimed to be the god of thunder, which Grandmaster merely mocked.

Thor witnesses Grandmaster killing Carlo
Thor was then brought along as Grandmaster went to meet with his cousin Carlo, who had seemingly attempted to make his escape from Sakaar only to be captured. While Carlo desperately begged for his life, Grandmaster pardoned him, to Carlo's relief. Grandmaster, however, revealed that he meant Carlo was pardoned from life before using the Melt Stick to kill him, as Thor looked on in utter horror as Carlo screamed while melting down into nothing but slime.

Thor being reunited back with Loki on Sakaar
While Grandmaster properly introduced himself and explained the Contest of Champions, Thor insisted he would not be a part of it and would be returning to Asgard. However, due to the unusual relativistic effects of how they got there, Thor discovered that Loki was still alive following the fight with Hela within the Bifrost Bridge and had already been there for several weeks, earning Grandmaster's favor while there, much to Thor's considerable confusion and annoyance.

Thor learns of Grandmaster's champion
Grandmaster questioned Loki over his relationship to Thor, to which Loki insisted that he had never met him before, and insisting he was adopted when Thor admitted they were brothers. As Thor continued to threaten Grandmaster for his own freedom, he then was told that the only way he could have his freedom was if he defeated the Contest of Champions' ultimate champion, which Thor was confident he could do before being taken away to his cell by Grandmaster.

Contest of Champions
Thor being introduced to Korg and Miek
Thor was thrown into the Contest of Champions' quarters where he was then introduced to Korg, an exiled Kronan resistance fighter, and his friend Miek. As Thor questioned how Korg how wound up becoming one of Grandmaster's warriors, Korg then explained it was down to a failed revolution while Thor also discovered that their cell was an endless circle which he could not escape from.
