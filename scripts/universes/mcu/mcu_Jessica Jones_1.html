Jessica Campbell Jones is a private investigator from New York City. After becoming orphaned at a young age, Jones was taken in by Dorothy Walker and developed a deep friendship bond with her adoptive sister, Trish Walker. Shortly after being adopted, Jones discovered she possessed superhuman abilities due to the fatal car crash that took the lives of her parents and eventually decided to pursue a career as a superhero. However, a fateful encounter with Kilgrave, a vicious man with mind controlling powers, derailed her superhero career and she spent a torturous tenure as Kilgrave's sex slave before finally breaking free of his control. The experience left Jones suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, prompting her to hang up her secret identity and open her own detective agency.

Trying to remain an average person and keep a low profile, she would take on minor cases for cash, while caught in a spiral of despair and destructive behavior. However, the return of Kilgrave and the victims he left in his wake on her behalf forced her to put aside her trauma and stop him. Jones had multiple grueling encounters with Kilgrave, but with the help of Walker, Jeri Hogarth, Claire Temple, and fellow superhuman Luke Cage, Jones finally killed the maniac, conquering her demons and prompting her to continue her superhero career.

While on the job, Jones received a case which ended when John Raymond was driven to suicide by the Hand, prompting her to continue the investigation and her being recruited by Stick to join Luke Cage, Iron Fist, and Daredevil, to destroy the Hand, ending with the apparent sacrifice of Daredevil. With her victory over both Kilgrave and the Hand, Jessica was held in considerable notoriety by the New York community and her detective business' success skyrocketed.

As her job was going full throttle, Jones' life took another unexpectedly dark turn when she began investigating IGH, the organization responsible for giving her her abilities while she was comatose following the car crash at her adolescence. Focusing on her investigations, Jones soon realized that her mother, Alisa Jones, was actually alive and had undergone experiments that gave her powers similar to her daughter's, but also left her dangerously unstable. Once Jones turned over her mother over to the police and attempted to secure for her sentence, Jones met Alisa after her escape and the two flee north in order to avoid being fugitives. At Playland, Jones witnessed her mother's death at the hands of Trish Walker and cut ties with her.

After meeting Erik Gelden, Jones found a lead on Gregory Sallinger. Reconciling and teaming up with the newly enhanced Trish Walker along the way, Jones tracked Sallinger and realized that he was able to outsmart her. After a cat-and-mouse game, Sallinger was finally exposed, only for Jeri Hogarth to step in and defend him, causing the public to turn against Jones and other powered individuals. When Jones was finally able to corner Sallinger, he retaliated by killing Dorothy Walker, sending the already unstable Walker into a downward spiral. While Jones put together the last pieces of the puzzle to put Sallinger in jail for life, Walker entered a killing spree, ending by killing the now in custody Sallinger, and forcing Jones to chase and imprison Walker for her crimes.

Biography
Early Life
Death of her Family
Jones with her family before the crash.
The only daughter of Brian and Alisa Jones, Jessica Jones often spent most of her time alone in her room and getting annoyed at overly nosy neighbors like Elizabeth De Luca. She also liked to watch people, writing her notes in a diary. Although her younger brother Phillip often pissed her off, Jones was incredibly protective of him, whom she described as a great boy. During a car trip with her family, an argument between her and her brother about a Gameboy distracted her father long enough for the car to hit the back of the truck in front of them, resulting in an accident that apparently killed everyone else in the car. leaving her orphaned.

Jones learns her family are all dead
While recovering in the hospital where she had fallen into a coma, Jones was adopted by Dorothy Walker as a publicity stunt to promote Trish Walker's television show. As Jones began to wake up from her coma while lying in bed, she overheard the Walkers discussing the death of her parents. This being the first time Jessica had learned of their death, she begins crying as the Walkers realized their mistake. Unbeknownst to her, IGH paid off Jessica's hospital bills. They also erased 17 days out of Jones' time in the hospital to cover up how she experimented with gene editing therapy, that would eventually cause Jessica to develop enhanced physical abilities, such as strength, mobility, and resilience, as well as a limited form of flight.

Living with the Walkers
Jones discovers her new incredible powers
As they prepared to leave Jones Residence where she had grown up, Dorothy Walker refused to allow her to search for her journal which she had lost. Much to Jones' annoyance, Walker proved to be very forceful and would often push Jones to say please and thank you to the point of rude judgment. As Jones sat in the car, she noticed that Trish Walker had bruises on her neck which were inflicted by her mother.

Jones speaks to Trish Walker in private
While living in the Walker residence, Jones would often overhear the Walkers having huge arguments about their daughter's television show. During one of these arguments, Jones locked herself in the bathroom and accidentally broke the sink made out of marble. Shocked by her own strength, Jones discovers that she could also lift the heavy sink above her head with one hand. She was spotted by Trish Walker, who was shocked at her incredible strength, but the pair agreed to keep each others' secrets from the world.

However, when Jones witnessed Dorothy forcing her daughter to vomit in the toilet in order to lose weight, Jones lost her temper. She grabbed her adopted mother and, with an incredible feat of strength, threw her across the room to protect her new sister. Dorothy ran downstairs while Jones helped Walker back to her feet and the pair struck up a friendship which would last for decades. Although Walker often pushed Jones to use her gifts for good, Jones preferred to keep them a secret.

College Years
Relationship with Stirling Adams
Jones finds Stirling Adams murdered
Jones enrolled in college, paid by Trish Walker against Jones' desires. One night at a bar, Jessica Jones met bartender Stirling Adams, who flirted with her. Later, he called Jessica and asked if she would like to join him for a whiskey. Eventually, they started to dating. She dropped out and moved in with Adams who hoped to open his own place called "Club Alias," while Jones used her strength for the occasional shoplifting, including her signature leather jacket, and stealing from automatic teller machines to support herself. Over the next month, she started to drift apart from Walker as she continued to abuse alcohol and drugs, helped by her sister continuing in the artistic life by attempting to become a singer. After Stirling was murdered by someone who repeatedly bashed his head against a wall, Jones decided to go after Walker, and found her about to have sex with Gus before Jones beat him up.

Crappy Jobs
Jones prepares to quit an early bad job
Jones began working at an office job within New York City for a few weeks and despised it. When her boss continued to discredit her work and make sexist remarks towards her, Jones used her detective skills to then blackmail her fraud-committing boss into giving her six months severance and a glowing recommendation for her next job. As she was leaving, the boss insulted her, and in the process mentioned her parents. Out of rage, she knocked over the many filing cabinets and walked out of the door.

Jones humiliates a sexist man in a bar
Later at the bar, Trish Walker tried to convince her to use her gifts to become a real superhero and protect innocent people, but Jones remained reluctant at the idea. As they were speaking, a man came over and tried to flirt with Walker, noting he remembered her as a child star on It's Patsy. When the man then made crude sexual jokes towards Walker, Jones challenged him to a strength competition, agreeing if she won he would buy all of their drinks and if he won she would have sex with him. Jones then wins the challenge and gets the money, while also forcing the man to apologize. Jones then uses the money to buy shots for everyone in the bar.

Jones after saving a little girl's life
Jones got another job, working at a cheap sandwich shop where she was forced to wear a large sandwich costume and hand out fliers to the uninterested bypassers. Clearly hating the job and feeling utterly humiliated by the stupid uniform, Jones put little effort into her work. However, while on the street, Jones witnessed a young girl run into the road and into the path of a taxi; Jones ran out and used her own strength to stop the taxi and saved the girl. Hearing the girl's gratitude and knowing she had made a difference had a big impact on Jones' mentality towards becoming a hero and saving more lives.

Jones mocks all of Trish Walker's ideas
Back at Trish Walker's Apartment, Jones continued to be pushed about the idea of her becoming a superhero like the Avengers, with Walker even having mock-up costumes made and pitching the new moniker "Jewel" as her own superhero name; however, Jones only mocked the idea more and refused to get involved. When Walker put on the mask to show it off, Jones simply turned it around to prove how easy it was to be blinded, so Walker suggested she fight crime naked instead. In the back of Jones' mind, she did consider the idea and decided to help people whenever she could, but didn't intend to take on an alter ego to do so.

Kilgrave's Influence
Living with Mental Torment
Jones first falls under Kilgrave's power
While walking one day, Jones came across Malcolm Ducasse about to be killed by muggers, whom she quickly overpowered in order to save him. This action was spotted by Kilgrave, who clapped enthusiastically, marveled at her powers. Using his own abilities, he enthralled her, and Jones immediately fell under Kilgrave's mind control powers, answering his questions and revealing her name. Kilgrave complimented her on her beauty before ordering her to join him for dinner, with she accepted due to his power.

Jones being controlled by Kilgrave
Over the next few months, Kilgrave kept Jones as his own prisoner, constantly using his powers to force her to spend time and have sex with him, which she always knew was rape despite Kilgrave believing it was a real relationship. When Trish Walker would call Jones to check that she was all right, Kilgrave ensured that Jones explained that everything was fine. Kilgrave would treat her to dinner, specifically at an Italian restaurant called Il Rosso, and use his vast wealth to stay in a five-star hotel; however, it would constantly be his powers keeping her there, not Jones' own free will.

Jones attempts to escape from Kilgrave
It quickly became clear that Kilgrave's powers would only last twelve hours until he would need to give a new order. One day, no order was given and Jones became free of him for a few short seconds, finally offering her a new chance to escape from his power. She considered jumping off the balcony and escaping, as she does that, Jones imagined a white horse below which was there to take her from Kilgrave, but before she could, Kilgrave ordered her to step down, putting her under his control again. When he questioned why she initially had not listened to him, he decided to punish her by ordering her to cut off her own ear, which later was revealed by Jessica to have a scar where he forced her to self-harm. When she began to obey, Kilgrave changed his mind and hugged her.

Breaking Free
Kilgrave becomes aware that Reva Connors was previously in possession of a hard-drive which he wished to gain ownership of for unknown reasons. With Jones by his side, Kilgrave put Connors under his power and discovers that she buried the hard-drive under concrete. Kilgrave orders Jones to uncover it and after hours of digging, which leads to her hands bleeding, Jones finds the hard-drive and gives it to Kilgrave.

Jessica resisting Kilgrave's commands
Satisfied that he had gotten what he desired, Kilgrave and the women step outside the warehouse. Kilgrave orders Jones to handle Connors, which Jones obeys by mustering all of her strength and punching Connors in the chest, stopping her heart and killing her instantly. However, the trauma of committing murder horrified Jones so much that she walked away from Kilgrave, ignoring his commands, successfully breaking away from his control. As Kilgrave screamed at Jones to come back to him, a bus swerved to miss Connors' body and instead hit Kilgrave, seemingly killing him.

Jones experiences PTSD flashbacks
Jones receives a death certificate which confirmed Kilgrave had been killed in the crash and returned to Trish Walker for comfort. However, the prolonged experience of being under Kilgrave's control left Jones suffering from PTSD and she gave up all hope of becoming a hero. Jones moved from Walker's apartment and found her own place, deciding to use her gifts to open Alias Investigations and earn a living investigating people, mainly men, and women having affairs. Jones became addicted to whiskey and avoided human contact as much as possible, even from her own adoptive sister.

Alias Investigations
Working for Jeri Hogarth
During her time as private investigator Jones started to work on jobs for Hogarth, Chao & Benowitz. So far Jones had finished eight jobs that no one could deliver on. The way she handled these jobs got several people to complain about her to Hogarth, who ignored them and kept Jones her methods a secret. When Jeri Hogarth asked her to become the private investigator for their law office, Jones, who preferred to work as a freelancer, declined.

Jones smashes her client through a door
Jones was hired by a man to stalk his wife to see if she was cheating on him. She tracked the woman down and found her having sex with another man. When Jones showed her client the photos at her office, he began to get angry that his own wife was cheating on him with his brother. When he began to get violently aggressive, Jones tossed him through the door, breaking it and its window, still demanding her payment.

Visiting Turk Barrett
Jessica Jones interrogating Turk Barrett
Jessica Jones was hired by a former lover of Turk Barrett to locate him and force him to give money in order to raise the child he had with her. When Barrett was attempting to get money from an old client, he was immediately ambushed by Daredevil. The brawl resulted in Barrett being brought to Metro-General Hospital, where Jones found him. Once she had established what had happened, Jones took Barrett's wallet to give to her client and disconnected his IV before leaving.

A Loosened Pole
Jones speaks to Jeri Hogarth
The next day, Jones walked into the offices of Jeri Hogarth. Jones asked Hogarth for a case, with Hogarth pointing that she had already hired a company private investigator. Hogarth called Jones out on her many flaws, only for Jones to point out that she had solved every single case that none of the other private eyes could. Hogarth gave Jones the assignment of serving a subpoena to Gregory Spheeris: an owner of numerous gentlemen clubs. One of Spheeris dancers apparently injured herself on a loosened pole. When Jones suspected she had an ulterior motive, Hogarth admitted several of her other clients were interested in taking Spheeris property.

Jones secretly spies on Luke Cage's life
At her apartment, Jones contacted Spheeris secretary Magda Simms under the guise of Karen Accord, one of Simms' old friends. Simms revealed to Jones the location that Spheeris was meeting an associate. Jones later tried to get some rest but found herself unable to sleep. She took her camera and began spying on a man named Luke Cage. Jones spied on Cage and a woman he was with and watched as he and the woman went up to his apartment to have sex. When she dozed off, she began to have a brief flashback of Kilgrave. She then proceeded to use the coping mechanism her therapist taught her.

Hope Shlottman's Case
Jones visited by Bob and Barbara Shlottman
The next day, Jones wakes up hearing noise from her kitchen. Jones went to the kitchen only to find her neighbor Malcolm Ducasse there eating her peanut butter. As Jones went to escort him out, she was confronted by a couple, Bob and Barbara Shlottman who were looking for their apparently missing daughter Hope. Barbara proceeded to explain how Hope was originally attending New York University on an athletic scholarship when she suddenly decided to "take a break," move out of her apartment and quit the track team. When the police said there was nothing they could do, someone recommended Jones.

Jones interviews Mei and Raj
Jones proceeded to accept their case. Later, when they left, Jones researched the Shlottmans to check their legitimacy. After confirming it, she researched Hope and her numerous track accomplishments and noticed a friend in one of her pictures. Jessica tracked down the old roommate, who was furious at Shlottman for leaving and had since replaced her with a new roommate called Raj who insisted on filming everything. Mei revealed to Jessica that Shlottman was with a new boyfriend she met.

Serving Spheeris
Jones stops Gregory Spheeris' car
Later, Jones tracked down Gregory Spheeris. She originally tried to talk to him by asking for directions, but when he rudely dismissed her and attempted to drive off, Jones resorted to picking up the car. Realizing she was another person with powers, Spheeris became afraid and threatened to tell the world about her abilities. However, Jones only pointed out that she was not really hiding and noted that no one would believe him before threatening to kill him with her "laser eyes." Spheeris proceeded to sign the subpoena.

Jones has another nightmare about Kilgrave
Back at the Alias Investigations Office, Jones falls asleep at her desk when she suddenly has a nightmare about Kilgrave touching her and tormenting her. Mentally and emotionally unhinged from the horrifying nightmare, the now unnerved Jones then received a phone call from Jeri Hogarth who briefly chastised her about how she had actually threatened Gregory Spheeris with her " laser eyes," only with Jones pointing out that Spheeris was so idiotic he would believe anything he said. Hogarth accepted this, giving Jones what she had considered a compliment before hanging up.
