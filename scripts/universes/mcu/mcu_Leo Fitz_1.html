Doctor Leopold James "Leo" Fitz is a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and scientist. A genius engineer, he is one of the youngest and most prominent members of S.H.I.E.L.D. Sci-Tech division, and inseparable from his research partner and friend (and later wife), Jemma Simmons. He, along with Simmons, was recruited to Phil Coulson's Team and worked with them on all of their missions. While on the team, Fitz became good friends with Grant Ward and Skye. During the HYDRA Uprising, Fitz was an active participant in hunting for John Garrett and the rest of the Centipede Project. When Ward, a HYDRA infiltrator, was ordered to kill him and Simmons, Fitz suffered brain damage due to prolonged time without oxygen after being dropped into the Atlantic Ocean.

As time progressed, Fitz's condition seemed to get better with help and support from his fellow S.H.I.E.L.D. colleagues rebuilding it. Slowly regaining his skills, Fitz was able to get back into doing active field and lab work under Coulson's supervision, and played an important role in the conflicts with Robert Gonzales' S.H.I.E.L.D. faction and during the War Against the Inhumans. After Simmons was swallowed by the Monolith, Fitz studied the Monolith for months and with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s help, he went through a portal to Maveth and rescued her. Fitz helped Simmons research a way back to the planet, but their work attracted the attention of HYDRA, who forced Fitz to go back to the planet to bring the insidious Inhuman Hive back to Earth. Following the Battle of Maveth, Fitz helped S.H.I.E.L.D. in defeating Hive and his plan to disperse a pathogen that would turn a portion of humans into Primitives.

Since Jeffrey Mace's appointment as the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Fitz worked with Holden Radcliffe on developing an Artificial Intelligence called Aida which was designed to serve S.H.I.E.L.D. as a decoy target. He was caught in an explosion with Coulson and Ghost Rider by Eli Morrow and was almost sent into another dimension, but managed to get out, and helped in stopping Morrow's evil plan. To Fitz's shock, Radcliffe betrayed S.H.I.E.L.D. and used Fitz's technology against S.H.I.E.L.D. Fitz was captured and his mind was connected to the virtual reality called the Framework where he lived a rewritten life as The Doctor, Aida's lover and HYDRA's ruthless second-in-command; he ultimately became the Framework's de facto dictator after Aida sustained injuries too serious for her to continue her duties as Madame Hydra. After he created for Aida a machine to become a real person, he was tricked by a repentant Radcliffe into approaching a backdoor to the real world; thus, Fitz left the Framework, traumatized from his behavior there. Shortly after, with the help of the Spirit of Vengeance, Fitz and his allies defeated Aida.

Despite having averted Aida's plan, it was at the cost of having become international fugitives, implicated for Mace's death, and the attack on Glenn Talbot. When his close friends were all abudcted by mysterious forces, Fitz was arrested by U.S. Air Force General Hale, who had accused him in abetting their escape. Six months into his imprisonment however, Lance Hunter rescued him and brought him to Enoch, the one responsible for the abduction of the agents. Fitz decided to go into suspended animation for 74 years to facilitate his rescue of the team.

A few months later, the ship he and Enoch were waiting on was attacked by the Confederacy, though Fitz and Enoch escaped. The two traveled through space for about a year until Fitz arrived on Kitson via the Lazy Comet and shortly after was captured by Malachi, being brought to a Confederacy ship. Upon 'reuniting' with Simmons, Quake, Piper and James Davis, Simmons bargained for her team-mates' lives and the two were plugged into the Cerebral Fusion Machine. After a confrontation with his dark self, Fitz and Simmons escaped the ship when Enoch incapacitated the Chronicoms who were watching them, with Enoch then using an Inter-Planetary Conveyance Disc to teleport them to Earth. The trip went wrong, however, and the trio found themselves on Kitson once again. Fitz was sentenced to death as he was still wanted, but the trio was saved by Izel and brought onto her crew.

FitzSimmons took the Lazy Comet back and headed for Earth, but upon realizing Izel's true nature fled from her and her crew. Fitz escaped in a Quinjet and at long last returned to Earth following a heartfelt reunion with his team. Fitz gave the agents support from the Lighthouse when they were attacking Izel, but when Chronicom Hunters attacked the Lighthouse, Fitz and Simmons were forced to retreat. With help from Enoch, Fitz and Simmons worked on a plan to prevent the Hunters to take over the Earth. To that end, they used a fragment of the Time Di'Alla to use all the time they needed, and also took some time for themselves to live some years of a peaceful life, during which Fitz fathered a daughter, Alya. Fitz then remained isolated while Simmons went to help the rest of the team travel through time and he would ensure their success by remaining hidden from both S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Chronicoms. Eventually, Fitz was reunited with his team after traveling between timelines through the Quantum Realm, and took part in the final victory against Sibyl. He and Simmons then retired from S.H.I.E.L.D. so they could raise their daughter and live a peaceful life.

Biography
Early Life
Raised by his Mother
A picture of a young Fitz with his mother
Leopold James Fitz was born in Scotland, United Kingdom on Wednesday, August 19, 1987. A genius-level engineer, whose only other relative is his mother, after his father, Alistair Fitz, left him at age ten. As a child, Fitz joined the Scouts, where he learned to make compasses.

S.H.I.E.L.D.
S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy
Leo Fitz started attending the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy of Science and Technology, where, when he was 16, he met and would become best friends with biochem genius, Jemma Simmons. The two were the youngest ever enrolled. However, originally the two were rivals, due to both being the smartest in their classes.

They would constantly compete with each other, never speaking to each other until they were paired together in chem lab, where they realized that together they were twice as smart. Among their instructors were Vaughn and Franklin Hall, who taught chemical kinetics during their second year.

Working with Jemma Simmons
Fitz meets up with Jemma Simmons
One night, the two planned to meet together in Fitz's room, but Simmons was twenty-four minutes late due to a conversation with Professor Anne Weaver, When Simmons arrived, Fitz addressed her lateness, which he feared was because she had blown him off.

Fitz talks with Jemma Simmons in his room
The two then awkwardly talked about each other's rooms until Simmons brought up the reason Fitz called her to his room, which was to help out with a problem he had. But, due to him trying to play cool, Fitz told Simmons that he really didn't need her help but thought it would be good to bounce ideas off her, which she interpreted as him seeing her as "thick wall". Fitz then tried to correct what he meant by saying she was good at clarifying good ideas and mapping out consequential results. That night, Fitz would feel at complete ease around Simmons.

Fitz and Jemma Simmons at the Academy
Fitz would come to despise Simmons' boyfriend Milton, but they would eventually break up. Fitz and Simmons graduated from the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy three years early in 2004. Wanting to see more than the inside of a lab, and against the advice of Professor Vaughn, Fitz was convinced Simmons to seek out a field assignment claiming it would be the perfect opportunity to see the world.

Meeting Phil Coulson
Fitz arriving to meet with Phil Coulson
Fitz and Simmons were called in to meet with Phil Coulson, for which they were both very nervous for, as Fitz thought they were getting transferred.

Fitz is recruited to be on Coulson's Team
As they walked up to the room, they talked amongst themselves about Coulson and the stories that they heard about him, making them more nervous, the two introduced themselves to Coulson, who was under the impression that "FitzSimmons" was one person. Coulson then went through the history, being the youngest to graduate, and an unauthorized biofuel experiment they conducted, which resulted in an explosion.

Fitz is nervous on joining Coulson's Team
However, not only did their experiment, a new way to power a Quinjet with an algae biofuel hydrogen cell, inspire the superiors to use their design, but to also nominate them for a new S.H.I.E.L.D. operative group. Fitz was initially against going, being afraid to go into the field, but Simmons was excited and convinced him. Stationed on the Bus, the pair have designed specialized equipment and compounds on the fly in various emergency situations.

Coulson's Team
Field Work
Fitz and Jemma Simmons meet Grant Ward
Fitz and Jemma Simmons were the first to arrive on the Bus, unloading all their equipment and bickering between each other until they were interrupted by Grant Ward, the next person on their team to arrive. Fitz enthusiastically greeted Ward before somewhat roughly taking his phone before smashing it. Phil Coulson then arrived and the team would soon begin to take off, commencing their soon to be multiple missions together.

Chase of Michael Peterson
Fitz searching around for Michael Peterson
Their first foray into the field involved the case of Michael Peterson, a man in danger of exploding due to his use of the volatile Centipede Serum. Fitz and Jemma Simmons investigated the Centipede Device and found that it was a combination of all known causes of superpowers including Chitauri technology, gamma radiation, the Super Soldier Serum, and Extremis. Meanwhile, they reproduced footage from the crime scene using the flash memory of a video camera and the audio recorded by Skye who had bugged the lab. 

Fitz put his thumb up after Peterson is alive
When Skye was kidnapped by Peterson, the team tracked them down to Union Station, trying to find a way to stop him without killing him. Fitz and Simmons eventually found a way to tranquilize Peterson without killing him and were able to give Grant Ward the Night-Night Gun before Peterson would cause an explosion from the Extremis.

Finding an 0-8-4
Fitz, Jemma Simmons and Skye take cover
