<html><p>The Avengers came together to guard the vibranium drill in order to keep the the Ultron Sentries from activating it to prevent the city from falling. As they prepared for the battle and destroyed the nearby Sentries, Iron Man mocked Black Widow for taking too long to arrive and joked she was messing about with Bruce Banner, while she noted that not every member of their team could fly.

Iron Man prepares for the Avengers' last stand
With all the Avengers assembled around the core, Iron Man looked on as Ultron gathered his army of Sentries, with Thor challenging his might by questioning if this was the best he could do. Having shown off his entire army, Ultron questioned how they possibly hoped to stop him, with Iron Man then quoting back Captain America's earlier words by telling Ultron that they would do it together, which caused Ultron to send in his hordes of Ultron Sentries.

Iron Man destroys all of the Ultron Sentries
As the army of Ultron Sentries charged into the church in an attempt to rip the Avengers apart and activate the key, Iron Man and the rest of the team used all of their might to fight back against the hordes of robots. As Iron Man flew around the church in his Mark XLV army, he assisted Scarlet Witch and all of the other Avengers by shooting the Sentries, cutting down their numbers swiftly. Using teamwork, the Avengers soon began defeating the entire Ultron army.

Iron Man destroys Ultron's entire body armor
Seeing the he was losing the battle, Ultron attempted to get involved himself in order to regain control, attacking Vision; however, he was soon knocked back out of the church when Vision used the power of the Mind Stone to push him down. Seeing this, Iron Man and Thor joined in, using the armor beams and Mjølnir's lightning to destroy Ultron's vibranium armor before Hulk then smashed him across the city and scared off the remaining Sentries.

Iron Man successfully destroys Novi Grad
With Ultron seemingly defeated, Iron Man ensured that the civilians were evacuated onto the Helicarrier while he went under the rock to overload the core. However, while Iron Man was cutting through the metal, Quicksilver was killed by Ultron before one sentry caused the city to fall. Iron Man and Thor succeeded in exploding up Sokovia before it hit the ground. The Ultron Offensive was then ended when the final Ultron Sentry was then destroyed by Vision.

Leaving the Avengers
Saying his Goodbyes
Stark drives to the New Avengers Facility
Following the Battle of Sokovia, Stark chose to retire as an active duty member of the Avengers, although he continued to support the Avengers financially, having converted his father's old warehouse in upstate New York into the New Avengers Facility.

Stark speaking with Steve Rogers and Thor
Stark drove to the facility to personally oversee it in action and say his final goodbyes to the whole team. Stark met with Steve Rogers and Thor at the facility where they all discussed Vision keeping the Mind Stone inside his head; Thor insisted that he could as he had proven himself worthy by managing to lift Mjølnir, although Rogers questioned if this counted as Vision was a machine. Thor informed the pair that he intended to return to Asgard to learn more about the Infinity Stones and who had been recently manipulating them into locating the stones.

Stark says goodbye to Captain America
As he bade farewell to Rogers, Stark mentioned that perhaps he would build Pepper Potts a house in the country like Clint Barton did and told Rogers that one day he too would retire before driving off. Later, Stark was asked by the media about the Hulk incident, to which he responded that public concerns about Bruce Banner were "baseless" and "irresponsible." Because of his activities as Iron Man, Stark and Potts took a break from their relationship while Stark continued his own work. Through YouTube, Stark soon became aware of the existence of a masked superhero in New York City named Spider-Man, who was strong enough to catch a speeding vehicle with his bare hands. Impressed, Stark noted that Spider-Man's strength was stronger than some of the Avengers and began looking into him. He then discovered that he was a fourteen year old student named Peter Parker who resided in Queens, and that he had gained his abilities after being bit a spider. Stark was further impressed after discovering that Parker had created his Synthetic Webbing and Web-Shooters on his own using over-the-counter materials, and wondered what Parker could do if he had access to the resources the Avengers had. As a result, Stark considered Spider-Man as a candidate for a potential future Avenger, and created an upgraded suit for him.

Facing the Consequences
Stark gives his lecture to MIT students
Stark gave a guest lecture at his alma mater, MIT, where demonstrated the students his latest device, the Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, created by Quentin Beck, which aimed to recreate and relive traumatic memories to help with regret. The demonstration of the technology included Stark's last meeting with his mother and father. Then he followed with a speech where he introduced the September Foundation grant and announced that every student had been made an equal recipient of it, giving them all the proper funding to move forward with their own inventions and ideas.

Stark is unnerved reading Pepper Potts' name
He then read from the teleprompter and was shocked to read that he should be presenting Pepper Potts to the stage. Seeing this made Stark briefly pause as he and Potts had broken up due to his own previous commitments to the Avengers and obsession with building new Iron Man Armors. Stark then said his final words before stepping off stage where the MIT Liaison then attempted to get some money from Stark Industries for the school's funding.

Stark is confronted by Miriam Sharpe
As he walked outside, he encountered a woman who complimented his funding. She reached to her purse and Stark, thinking she was about to pull a gun, grabbed her hand. But instead, she pulled a photo of her son and told him that he had been killed during the Battle of Sokovia. She then told Stark her son's name and that she did not actually blame Ultron for her son's death, but blamed Stark instead; which deeply unnerved him.

Avengers Civil War
Sokovia Accords
Stark listens to Thaddeus Ross' speech
On May 5, 2016, Thaddeus Ross presented to Stark the Sokovia Accords, a document which required the Avengers to operate under the supervision of an United Nations panel. Stark, haunted by the massive damage he had caused by creating Ultron, agreed to sign the Accords. One month after the Incident on Lagos involving Crossbones, both Stark and Ross went to the New Avengers Facility, where he tried to convince the Avengers to sign the Accords.

Stark checks on Steve Rogers' reaction
The Avengers were briefed on the Accords by Ross, who explained that the Accords were created as a result of the catastrophic events in which they were involved, including the Battle of New York and the Battle of Sokovia, with Ross presenting them with both the number of casualties caused and the expense of the damages. While the presentation was stopped for upsetting Wanda Maximoff, Ross told them the Accords would be signed in just a few days.

Stark listens to all the Avengers arguments
With Ross gone, the Avengers moved into another room to read and debate the Accords, with Sam Wilson and James Rhodes almost immediately clashing on their different views. Vision then noted that perhaps their own existence had caused the conflicts they were fighting. As all the Avengers debated whether to sign it or not, Stark remained silent, with Steve Rogers realizing that Stark had already chosen his own side, which was to be pro-Accords.

Stark argues for signing the Sokovia Accords
Stark gave them the story of Charlie Spencer and how he had been killed in Sokovia. He pointed out that the group needed to be put in check or they were no better than the bad guys, while also pointing out his role in Ultron's creation. However, Rogers saw the Accords as a block to keep the Avengers from where they needed to be, while Stark noted that if they did not decide to make this decision themselves, it would be done to them at some point soon with far graver consequences for all of them.

Stark manages to convince Natasha Romanoff
Stark and Rogers both argued with each other and then Stark even got surprising support from Natasha Romanoff, who had previously expressed her disdain for this kind of government oversight in the wake of the HYDRA Uprising and the Battle at the Triskelion. Their argument ended when Rogers left the room upon hearing news that Peggy Carter had died in her sleep, while Stark remained unchanged in his opinion that signing was the right decision.

Fighting with a Friend
Stark gives another update to Thaddeus Ross
Seeking to continue supporting the Sokovia Accords, Stark went into the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre where he assisted with the fallout from the Bombing of the Vienna International Centre. When Stark was informed that Captain America and Falcon had tried and failed to save the Winter Soldier from being arrested, Stark greeted them both upon their arrival, noting that Secretary Thaddeus Ross wanted them both prosecuted for their all of actions.

Stark has another debate with Steve Rogers
Having also asked Vision to keep Wanda Maximoff inside the New Avengers Facility in order to protect her, in the wake of her accident in Lagos had resulted in her US Visa being removed. Sitting down with Steve Rogers, where he once again attempted to convince him to sign the Sokovia Accords. Presenting Howard Stark's pens which had been used by Franklin D. Roosevelt to sign the Lend-Lease bill, hoping this could help to change Rogers' mindset on the Accords. When Rogers asked about Pepper Potts, Stark revealed that now they were taking a break from their relationship, with Rogers then apologizing for bringing it up as he did not know.

Stark makes his argument for the Accords
As Stark noted how after Aldrich Killian's War he had destroyed the Iron Legion for Potts, but since then he had armored up again and again to stop HYDRA and Ultron, admitting that Ultron was his own doing and that he did not want to stop being Iron Man, and he had hoped signing the Accords could win Potts back. They then briefly discussed his own father's relationship to his mother before Rogers admitted he could not ignore bad situations from happening.

Stark is again turned down by Steve Rogers
Begging Rogers to sign, Stark promised that Bucky Barnes would not be sent to a Wakandan prison. As Rogers seemed to consider signing, they discussed adding safeguards to the Accords. However, when Stark noted that Maximoff was locked up, Rogers confronted him about locking up a child, something Rogers saw akin to Japanese Internment during World War II, with Stark insisting that he was just doing what needed to be done for the Avengers, until Rogers walked out.

Escape from the JCTC
Stark goes to hunt down the Winter Soldier
During Bucky Barnes' psychological assessment, Stark watched closely as the the physiatrist questioned him about his time as an assassin for HYDRA. During the questioning however, a power failure occurred and Barnes freed himself and tried to escape. While Everett Ross tried to sort out their situation, Stark contacted F.R.I.D.A.Y. and went to confront Barnes himself without his Iron Man Armor to defend himself with from the furious Barnes.

Stark is attacked by the Winter Soldier
Stark engaged Barnes, backed up by Natasha Romanoff and Sharon Carter. Stark used his gauntlet to fight him by first firing flash beam towards the Winter Soldier which briefly blinded him before blocking a gunshot with the gauntlet and then ripping the gun apart: However, Barnes managed to overpower him. Barnes escaped, but Stark knew Barnes was most likely still with Steve Rogers, who, along with Sam Wilson, had also managed to escape from their custody.

Stark is confronted by Thaddeus Ross
While the base recovered from the Winter Soldier's escape, Stark was greeted by Secretary Thaddeus Ross who informed him that due to his involvement in helping their target escape, a special force unit would deal with Rogers. Stark, however, convinced Ross to let him bring them in, promising to wear the Mark XLVI to bring him in, which Ross accepted. As he left the base, Ross gave Stark thirty six hours before lethal force would be utilized.

Stark decides to call in Spider-Man for help
As Stark considered what to do, Romanoff reminded him that they were understaffed, with Stark questioning if she knew where Hulk was, despite Romanoff noting that Bruce Banner would not be on their side. Thinking of possible allies, Stark informed Romanoff that he knew of someone, and as Romanoff approached T'Challa to ask for his help, Stark flew to New York City to recruit Spider-Man.

Recruiting Peter Parker
Stark has tea with Peter Parker's Aunt May
Having deduced Spider-Man's true identity as Peter Parker, Stark decided to pay him a visit at home. He waited for him to return from school where he openly flirted with his aunt, May. As Parker returned, Stark persuaded him to trick his aunt into thinking that Parker had applied for Stark's scholarship.

Stark shows Parker footage of Spider-Man
Stark entered his room with Parker and was soon impressed by how Parker used the technology he had retrieved from the trash to build himself computers and other technology. When Parker attempted to explain that he had not applied for the grant, Stark stopped him before he then showed Parker videos of him as Spider-Man saving civilians, complimenting him on his powers as they watched footage of him stopping a car with his bare hands; stating that the car was three thousand pounds and going forty miles per hour when Parker stopped it.

Stark discusses all Peter Parker's equipment
Parker denied that the person in the video was him, claiming it was edited footage, but Stark quickly found his Spider-Man Suit and equipment, forcing him to admit the truth. Stark asked him if anyone knew who he was, to which Parker informed him that nobody else knew. Stark then complimented Parker on his Web-Shooters and was surprised to learn that Parker had built the webbing himself before Stark joked about Parker's suit and told him he needed an upgrade.

Stark asks Spider-Man to come on a mission
Stark questioned why Parker became Spider-Man, being told that he only wanted to use his powers for the benefit of the people, noting that he believed that if he did not do the right thing with his powers, then good people would get hurt as a result, which Stark understood completely. Believing that Spider-Man could now be of great benefit during the upcoming Clash of the Avengers, Stark sat next to Parker and decided to officially recruit him into his own team.

Stark is webbed to the door by Peter Parker
Impressed, Stark asked him if he wanted to go to Germany, and jokingly told Parker that he would tell his aunt that he was taking Parker on a field trip, to which Parker responded by webbing Stark to the door. When Parker agreed to help him, Stark tasked Happy Hogan with delivering Parker his new suit and accompanying him to Germany.

Failed Negotiations
Iron Man finds and threatens Captain America
Stark learned of Steve Rogers' plan was to escape from the Leipzig-Halle Airport, so he and his teammates evacuated the airport and waited for Rogers and his team. Rogers soon showed up and Stark, with his newest armor and attempted to convince him to turn over the Winter Soldier to the authorities and surrender before Secretary Thaddeus Ross ordered that lethal force would be taken.

Stark challenges Captain America
Rogers insisted that Helmut Zemo had posed as the psychiatrist interviewing Bucky Barnes and was behind everything. Iron Man noted that Barnes was responsible for the Bombing of the Vienna International Centre which had killed T'Chaka and many others, and therefore needed to face justice, while Rogers claimed that Zemo was planning on unleashing more of the Winter Soldiers. Stark soon found that their negotiation was going nowhere.

Stark gives his new orders to Spider-Man
As a result, Stark called in Spider-Man to steal Captain America's Shield and to tie Rogers' hands using his Web-Shooters. Much to Iron Man's annoyance, Spider-Man was more concerned about meeting his hero, Captain America, and therefore acting immaturely during the encounter, forcing Iron Man to tell him to calm down. With Rogers now trapped, Iron Man ordering him to listen to his views on the Sokovia Accords, but Rogers remained uncompromising.

Stark shoots at Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch
Before they could take in Rogers, Hawkeye used an arrow to free him before Ant-Man returned the shield to Captain America. As the Mark XLVI's sensors then detected the rest of the renegades making their way towards the Quinjet, Iron Man flew off to confront Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch, telling War Machine to take on Captain America before ordering Spider-Man to keep his distance and web up his foes from afar. Iron Man quickly caught up with Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch, managing to block their path with missile strikes.

Iron Man corners Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch
With his two former allies now seemingly trapped, Iron Man began joking that Scarlet Witch had hurt Vision's feeling as she escaped from the New Avengers Facility, with Scarlet Witch expressing her disgust at being locked away while Iron Man claimed it was for her own protection after the Lagos Catastrophe. Iron Man then casually greeted Hawkeye and asking about what he had been up to during his retirement from the Avengers, asking if he played golf.

Iron Man is trapped by the Scarlet Witch
As they were talking, Hawkeye then deliberately fired an arrow to miss Iron Man, which he shot out of the sky and joked that Hawkeye had finally missed a shot. Hawkeye, however, then revealed that this was a deception as it had now left Iron Man open to being pinned under several cars by Scarlet Witch. With Iron Man now trapped underneath all of the crashed cars, F.R.I.D.A.Y. alerted him he was in danger which Iron Man noted he was already aware of.

Iron Man helps Black Widow onto her feet
Freeing himself, Iron Man helped Black Widow up after she, Black Panther, and War Machine had nearly been killed by Captain America and Ant-Man using the Pym Particles Disks to throw a truck at them. Seeing the single mindedness that was driving Rogers, Iron Man was left with no choice but to call in his trump card: Vision to come into the battle and give them the advantage they needed to finally bring all of Captain America's team members into their custody.

Clash of the Avengers
Iron Man commands his own Avengers team
Eventually, Vision fired a powerful burst from the Mind Stone to attempt to cow Captain America into submission before offering him a final chance to surrender. Regrouping his team, Iron Man stood across from Captain America's team to try and force his ally to stand down. However, Captain America refused again, forcing Iron Man to order his team into battle with the directive to capture their renegade teammates alive.

Iron Man attacks Captain America
Iron Man engaged Captain America in one on one melee combat before Hawkeye fired an explosive arrow towards the Mark XLVI to no effect other than knocking him back. As the Avengers all fought each other across the airport, Iron Man later chose to attack Falcon in a midair battle, before Hawkeye fired a volley of arrows towards Iron Man. The Mark XLVI's systems were able to easily trace the path of the arrows and then destroy them all one by one.

Iron Man's armor is hacked by Ant-Man
As Iron Man prepared to take down Hawkeye with a carefully aimed shot, the left repulsor failed. Demanding an update from F.R.I.D.A.Y., she tracked the problem to Ant-Man having entered the suit and was disabling it from the inside, teasing him that the voice he could hear was his conscience. Iron Man and Ant-Man continued to mock each other before, getting fed up, F.R.I.D.A.Y. ejected him via the usage of fire retardant foam sending him falling back to the ground.

Iron Man has a skirmish with Falcon
When it became clear Iron Man's team would win the battle, Ant-Man inverted his powers and grew to sixty feet in height, turning himself into Giant-Man. Iron Man looked on in amazement as Giant-Man grabbed War Machine out of the sky. As Iron Man ordered Giant-Man to free War Machine, he was then attacked by Falcon, who fired the Redwing drone to stun Iron Man in mid air. While the drone threw off Iron Man's flight plan, it shattered apart against the armor.

Iron Man and War Machine attack Giant-Man
Working with War Machine and Spider-Man, the three attempted to find a way to stop Giant-Man while he helped Captain America and Bucky Barnes to get away. Spider-Man soon came up with an idea to managed to recreate a moment from The Empire Strikes Back, calling it a really old movie which caused War Machine to question Iron Man on how old Spider-Man really was. While Spider-Man used his Web-Shooters to tie up Giant-Man's legs, Iron Man and War Machine flew up and hit him hard in the chin.

Iron Man checks on Spider-Man's condition
While they succeeded with knocking down the giant Ant-Man, as he fell, Ant-Man had managed to knock Spider-Man out of the air and onto the concrete from a great height prompting Iron Man to fly down to check on him. When he was satisfied with Spider-Man's state, he decided it was time to send him back to New York City threatening to call his Aunt May if the enhanced youth did not listen to him. Despite protesting, Spider-Man soon collapsed from exhaustion.

Iron Man chases down Captain America
Iron Man flew off to chase after the now hijacked Quinjet containing Captain America and Barnes, who had managed to get away with the assistance of Black Widow who had subdued Black Panther from them. Iron Man was backed up by War Machine in his pursuit before Falcon began following them. Rhodes ordered Vision to destroy Falcon's flight gear with the Mind Stone but the android miscalculated and shot out War Machine's Arc Reactor, taking the power out of the suit in hundreds of feet above the ground.

Iron Man barely fails to save War Machine
As War Machine fell towards the ground, Iron Man changed direction and tried to save his friend but was just unable to catch him in time before he crashed. He immediately ordered F.R.I.D.A.Y. to scan for life signs and she contacted emergency medical personnel when she found War Machine was still alive, but is left paralyzed. Falcon also landed and told Iron Man he was sorry, but Iron Man vented his rage by blasting him with a repulsor beam, decisively ending the extended fight.

Clash Aftermath
Stark questions Vision about his mistake
With the Clash of the Avengers over, Stark arrived at the Columbia University Medical Center, checking on James Rhodes' current state as his body was X-Rayed. Stark then questioned exactly how Vision could make a mistake like that and Vision admitted he had been distracted by Scarlet Witch, which neither he nor Stark had known could happen.

Stark decides to confront Natasha Romanoff
Stark then stepped outside of the operating room when he was then approached by Natasha Romanoff, to whom he then explained Rhodes' condition before he told her that he was disappointed she allowed Steve Rogers and the Winter Soldier to escape, inadvertently leading to Rhodes' accident. Although Romanoff insisted that they had made all of the wrong actions in trying to resolve their situation, Stark then insults her by calling her a double agent for assisting Rogers.

Stark has a discussion with Natasha Romanoff
Stark told her that T'Challa had informed Thaddeus Ross about her betrayal and that the government and the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre would likely come to arrest her. When she insisted they went about this wrong, he then commented that betraying people was something Romanoff seemed unable to help. He made no attempt to help or detain her as she fled the facility to go underground showing he was losing faith in all of his own former teammates.

The Raft
Stark discovers Helmut Zemo's schemes
In order to find Steve Rogers, Stark went to visit the Raft, where his teammates were imprisoned. On his way to the prison, F.R.I.D.A.Y. informed Stark that the therapist who was supposed to do Bucky Barnes' psychological evaluation, had been killed by Helmut Zemo from Sokovia. She told him that Zemo had framed Barnes for the terrorist attacks as Stark realized that he had been wrong.

Stark is met by Thaddeus Ross inside the Raft
Upon arriving at the Raft, Thaddeus Ross greeted Stark who tried to immediately organize the hunt for Zemo in order to bring him to justice; however, Ross noted that in the wake of the Clash of the Avengers he would not be taking orders from Stark, claiming that Stark was lucky not to be arrested himself. Although Ross did not believe Stark, he allowed him to speak to the prisoners, as Stark saw that Scarlet Witch's powers being kept under their control.

Stark confronts Clint Barton in his prison cell
As Stark walked through the cell block, Clint Barton got to his feet and expressed the fact that he was enraged at Stark's supposed betrayal of his former Avengers teammates. Stark argued that he did not know that Barton would end up there, with Barton noted the place was for criminals, which Stark had made them all. Stark argued that Barton had walked away from his wife and children to break the law, accusing Barton of choosing the wrong side to fight for.

Stark walks away from Clint Barton's insults
As Stark walked away, Barton slammed his hands against his cell wall and accused him of being willing to break their backs, referring James Rhodes' injures during the recent fight. Stark then walked past Scott Lang, who said Hank Pym was right not to trust the Starks, due to his relationship with Howard Stark. Stark, however, calmly asked him who he is as he walked past, much to Lang's disappointment.

Stark makes a secret deal with Sam Wilson
As he approached Sam Wilson, who asked about Rhodes' condition, Stark asked him to tell him where Steve Rogers had gone. Wilson did not want to do it, but Stark admitted that since learning about Zemo he knew that he was wrong not to listen earlier and that he wanted to help Rogers. Stark knocked out the audio feed, so Wilson then told him that Rogers was heading for the a HYDRA base in Siberia, telling Stark to go alone to assist Rogers in stopping Zemo.

Stark lies to Thaddeus Ross as he leaves
Knowing Ross would be of no aid with the hunt for Zemo due to his desire to bring the Winter Soldier in custody for his believed part in T'Chaka and many other deaths, Stark decided to withhold the information. As Stark made his way towards his helicopter, Ross questioned if Wilson had given him intel about where Rogers was, but Stark denied it and promised not to answer all Ross' calls if he contacted the New Avengers Facility while he departed.

Iron Man flies away towards Siberia
While onboard his own helicopter, Stark then considered how he now would approach Rogers in the wake of everything that had happened before he donned the Mark XLVI in his helicopter and flew to Siberia, using the rain to cover his movements in the hope that Ross would not follow him and arrest Rogers. However, Iron Man was unaware that Black Panther was actually following behind him while onboard his own Jet to find and kill Barnes once and for all.

Helmut Zemo's Secret
Stark finds Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes
Entering the HYDRA Siberian Facility, Iron Man pulled open the doors and saw Captain America and Bucky Barnes were waiting for him, ready with their defenses. Greeting the pair, Stark noted that Rogers seemed defensive, with Rogers noting it had been a long day, before Stark told Barnes that he was not currently targeting him because he had decided to listen to Rogers' points.

Stark makes peace with Captain America
Noting that Thaddeus Ross did not know that he was there and he wanted to keep it that way as he was currently violating the Sokovia Accords by even talking with Rogers without Ross' approval. Stark agreed to put aside the arrest warrant for the two to help them find Helmut Zemo before he could unleash the Winter Soldiers, with Stark calling Barnes the Manchurian Candidate and asking him to put down his weapon as he promised they would not fight.

Iron Man searches around for Helmut Zemo
Upon reaching the main room, however, all the Mark XLVI's thermal scanners revealed that Zemo had killed the Soldiers instead before the man revealed himself within a bunker where he explained that he had successfully managed to bring Stark to the base, after a year of planning. Rogers realized that Zemo was from Sokovia and wanted revenge for the Battle of Sokovia. Blaming the Avengers for the loss of his family, he had orchestrated a plot to tear them apart.

Stark watches his own parents' murders
Zemo then played the video footage of the night that Stark's parents died, revealing that HYDRA used the Winter Soldier to assassinate them in order to steal the Super Soldier Serum inside their car trunk. Stark watched in complete horror as the footage showed the Winter Soldier brutally killing Howard Stark by using his Prosthetic Arm to crack his skull before breaking Maria Stark's neck without emotion before shooting the camera that had captured their deaths.

Stark learns Steve Rogers withheld the truth
Having finally learned the truth of what happened to his parents, Stark processed everything that he had just been shown before he then demanded Rogers to tell him if he had known that Barnes had killed his parents. Rogers responded that he had known their deaths had been ordered by HYDRA, but was unaware that Barnes had been the killer. Stark instantly saw through the lie and demanded the truth, forcing Rogers to reveal that he had known it had been Barnes for years, but hid that fact. Horrified that his friend and fellow Avenger had been lying to him for years, Stark took a step back to consider his next actions in response to this news.

Battle at the HYDRA Facility
Iron Man furiously attacking Bucky Barnes
Already enraged by the fallout of Captain America' questionable and biased actions over the past few days, Iron Man snaps and attacked Bucky Barnes to avenge his parents. Iron Man struck Captain America in the face and shot the gun out of Barnes' hand before flying him across the facility and pinning him down by forcing his foot against his arm and aiming his blaster shot at his skull.

Iron Man tries to subdue Captain America
While they fought, Helmut Zemo made his escape from the facility. Iron Man attempted to shoot Barnes point blank in the face, but Captain America ran to his aid and threw his shield at his to deflect the attack before he attempted to push Iron Man off Barnes. Acknowledging their friendship, Iron Man tried to force Rogers out of the fight using the leg clamps which Rogers soon broke free of. Iron Man grabbed Barnes and flew him into the wall.

Iron Man's shot is deflected by Bucky Barnes
Barnes managed to use his prosthetic arm to damage Iron Man's repulsor beam in his hand by crushing it. In response, Iron Man aimed a missile directly at Barnes' face, which he managed to push out of the way, causing it to destroy much of the entire HYDRA Siberian Facility around them. While the pair became separated, the Barnes regrouped with Captain America while Iron Man was briefly trapped under all of the debris.

Iron Man orders Captain America to move
As Barnes made his way towards the exit, Iron Man freed himself and chased after him, only for Captain America to stand in his way. Captain America insisted that Howard and Maria's deaths were not Barnes' fault as HYDRA had control of his mind and it had been ordered by Vasily Karpov, but this falls on deaf ears as Iron Man ordered him to move. Captain America damaged Iron Man's leg stabilizers before Iron Man used the laser to trap Captain America while he went for Barnes.

Iron Man is knocked down several floor levels
While Iron Man quickly caught up with his target, who was attempted to climb up the building to reach the helicopter hatch in the roof, Iron Man kicked him across the facility and took aim at him yet again with a deadly kill shot. However, Captain America refused to stand down from the fight, deflecting a lethal repulsor back at Iron Man, disabling the Mark XLVI's targeting system and using a wire to pull him down when Iron Man continued to chase after Barnes.

Iron Man attempts to shoot at Bucky Barnes
When Captain America threw his shield at him, Iron Man was able to shoot it out of the air, leaving Captain America now defenseless and unable to aid Barnes. As he could no longer target Barnes with his missiles, Stark opted to trap Barnes within the bunker for their final showdown. With F.R.I.D.A.Y. informing him that his weapons systems could not target him, Iron Man used his own eye to aim and shoot at Barnes, destroying the main hatch and trapping him inside.

Iron Man tries to strangle the Bucky Barnes
With Barnes now trapped inside, Iron Man charged towards him as they engaged in hand to hand combat until Iron Man began crushing him under the Mark XLVI's weight. Holding him there, Iron Man then questioned if he even remembered killing his mother and father, with Barnes insisting that he remembered everyone who he had killed for HYDRA. Captain America jumped at the pair, knocking himself and Iron Man back down to the ground floor.

Final Showdown
Iron Man stands against Captain America
As Iron Man and Captain America faced each other, Captain America insisted that nothing would change what happened all those years ago. Here, Iron Man stated in no uncertain terms that he was done listening to Rogers as the Winter Soldier had killed his own mother, which he would not forgive before Stark then charged forward and attacked his former friend, willing to even kill him in order to get to the Winter Soldier.

Iron Man fighting against Bucky Barnes
Iron Man quickly overpowered him in melee combat before Bucky Barnes intervened by striking him with Captain America's Shield, turning the fight into a two on one brawl. Iron Man responded to the uneven odds by blasting Captain America with a repulsor before he was forced against the wall by Barnes. Barnes attempted to remove the suit's Arc Reactor with his robotic arm to which Iron Man unleashed a Unibeam that disintegrated the majority of the arm.

Iron Man battles against Captain America
A recovered and enraged Captain America then stormed at Iron Man in order to defend Barnes from being executed, deflecting repulsor fire with his shield before forcing Iron Man back against the wall and pummeling him relentlessly. Despite having the Mark XLVI to protect himself from all of the attacks, Iron Man soon found himself outmatched due to the Super Soldier Serum that had given Captain America all of his strength and his superior fighting skills.

Iron Man gains the upper hand in their fight
Realizing he was incapable of competing with Captain America in close quarters hand to hand combat, Iron Man ordered F.R.I.D.A.Y. to analyze Captain America's movement patterns to find weaknesses to exploit. Iron Man overpowered Captain America in combat and then blew away the shield and brutally beat him into submission, using his suit's strength and repulsors to give himself the advantage and attacks Captain America. Unable to counter them all, Rogers is overwhelmed.

Iron Man tells Captain America to stand down
Exhausted from the fight, Captain America tried once again to reason with Iron Man, defending Barnes as his friend before Iron Man commented that he had also once been his friend. Iron Man then beat Captain America down even more and tossed him aside. When Captain America got to his feet to continue the fight, claiming that he could do this all day, Iron Man aimed his repulsor beam directly at his face and gave Captain America a final chance to stand down and end the fight.

Iron Man's Arc Reactor is broken by Rogers
As Captain America stood unyielding, Iron Man realized he would never stand down and charged a repulsor. A wounded Barnes grabbed Iron Man's boot, distracting him and Iron Man kicked Barnes in the face. This diversion allowed Captain America to turn the tide of the battle, using his own shield to destroy the Mark XLVI's helmet. Instead of killing Iron Man, however, Captain America smashed his shield into the main Arc Reactor, destroying it and leaving his armor now completely powerless.

Iron Man watches Captain America walk away
Left covered in blood and now running purely on the suit's backup miniature Arc Reactors, Iron Man was unable to continue fighting as Captain America reclaimed the shield and helped Barnes onto his feet. But as he watched them leaving, Iron Man claimed that Captain America did not deserve his shield, since his father had made it in World War II. Captain America reluctantly drops his vibranium shield, returning it to the Stark family, and left the scene with Barnes, leaving Iron Man behind alone.

Spider-Man's Beginning
Stark films a video message for May Parker
After his battle in Siberia, Stark and Happy Hogan dropped Peter Parker back off at his apartment in New York City and told Hogan to give the Spider-Man Suit to Parker. A shocked Parker asked if he was allowed to keep it, which Stark confirmed. He also advised Parker not to do anything rash and not to stress Hogan, who would monitor all his activities.
