<html><p>As soon as they arrived with Keller's team at the jewelry store, they found it empty, so May ordered the agents to guard if they are still here. Meanwhile, Keller checked the two guards and unfortunately verified that they died then, along with May, Yo-Yo and another agent, he headed for the Vault, where the gang has holed up with the owner, who they took as hostage and May noticed that the shutdown has jumped; then asked if they are in there, to which Keller agreed that no one is out, then May ordered Yo-Yo to check the perimeter, using her speed, during which she confirmed that they haven't gotten out yet and that they owe it do they have to go through that door, causing May to suspect something was wrong and Yo-Yo asked what they wanted, to which May said she doesn't know, but she knows for sure that no one with a Coulson face would walk in with a super strategic tactic to then flee immediately and asked to see through the Vault.

She saw through the infrared viewer that there are five people and asked Keller how many people entered, to which he replied that three plus one hostage entered, and May is wondering why she detected five, but she saw that there 'it was a hole in the wall, which was half a meter thick of steel and concrete, making her suspect they have a way out, but she didn't understand where they are or how they came up with that clever strategy. Keller replied that it was technology light years away from them, to which May confirmed, but Yo-Yo said that every time they try to get close to them, they disappear everywhere, like the museum and the convenience store and that it is escaping them everything, not something and that they will never know where they are going, but Yo-Yo's words make May understand where they were on the other side of the wall: in the shipping center, where their truck is also, invisible from them set off.

May then returned to the expedition center to find the truck, albeit invisible, scouring the whole place, until she found traces of the truck that stopped as if it had dematerialized. To confirm her suspicions, May grabbed some sand and threw it at the invisible truck, during which she was able to find it, in the process.

Even though he is invisible, May managed to find the door of the truck and knocked, and as soon as one of the gang opened the door, believing he was their leader, she fought him, asking where their leader was, but she also saw that there was the portal that led to the jewelry, but the man, not giving up, fought against May, also asking for help, but she knocked him out, silencing him, but the big man, hearing her cries for help, he went to help his friend while also fighting May. The latter, despite the size of the big man and his superior skills, to which she was almost doomed, managed to resist giving him a distraction and hitting him with a shovel in the process.

Hearing the cries of the jewelry owner, May entered the store vault through the portal created by them and saw a woman holding her hostage with a knife, to which May asked her to throw it and ordered her to tell where her was boss, but she said that she sensed an exaggerated amount of negative anger in May, to which she responded with a flying kick and managed to save the owner and knocked down the wall with the portal to prevent her from passing. After rescuing her, she was nearly knocked out by the big man, who pulled up the wall, letting the woman out and May prepared to fight them, even though they were two on one.

Despite this, the latter managed to find a great amount of strength and anger necessary to be able to beat them both, making the woman faint and managing to hurt the big man and give him frying pans in the head, but, just before giving him the coup de grace, the man with Coulson's face, having heard the screams of the fleeing woman, arrived to see what was happening, saying that the plan was fried right away, as he was gone for a minute. Finally seeing the man face to face, even though she was shocked, May called the man by the name of her lover, but this shocking discovery gave the team time to drop her through the portal that led to the jewelry store and they removed the contraption. he held the portal, although May asked him to wait. When Yo-Yo and Keller managed to get in, the first asked how she got in and what happened, but May simply replied "I lost."

Personality
Melinda May is a quiet person who was once described as "warm", "fearless" and unafraid to break rules. May was a veteran pilot and soldier until she was 'damaged' from an incident in Bahrain, where she had to kill an Inhuman child unable to control her powers; as May wanted children, this broke her. May was married to Dr. Andrew Garner, but she doesn't discuss her past with her teammates. As part of Coulson's Team, May showed her joker side by using the classic "whip cream" gag on Leo Fitz, who thought it was one of the other four because May seemed less likely. 

May has an unwavering respect for Phil Coulson and follows his orders even when it conflicts with her desires, as when she yielded in her pursuit of Carl Creel. She was deeply hurt when she heard he had died. As her LMD later confirms, May holds affection for Coulson. 

May is fiercely protective of her teammates, going back into the field to protect Coulson despite having retired from field missions, taking up the Berserker Staff instead of Grant Ward, and going so far as attacking Ian Quinn after he shot Skye. She is very secretive and will often answer questions with a look, using few words or none at all. Despite her protectiveness of them, it took May a long time to bond with her team. Skye even claimed that she acted like a robot, as everything for her was just "Target- acquired. Threat- eliminated." Melinda May puts up a cold and stoic front but inside she is kind and selfless. She uses her own experiences to connect with other people.

Despite being able to use various types of guns with high proficiency, May displays constant reluctance to resort to such weaponry, instead relying on her tremendous fighting abilities to take down her enemies. The fact that she only uses firearms when it is absolutely necessary, like during the Siege of the Lighthouse, has become somewhat of a running gag among her teammates. Therefore, when May was seen repeatedly shooting Sarge in an apparent attempt to kill him, her teammates knew that something was wrong since May would really have gone hand-to-hand with him, and they eventually figured out that she had been possessed by Izel.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Empathy: Her temporary stay in the Fear Dimension disrupted May's ability to feel emotions. Instead, May acquired the ability to sense other humans' emotions and feelings through proximity, to the point that she can become overwhelmed by these emotions if she remains close to one person for too long. However, she is completely devoid of emotion when not in the proximity of another person. This power enables May to sense whether someone she touches is a real human or not.
Former Powers
Enhanced Strength: Due to the enchantments placed on the Berserker Staff, she gained enhanced strength while holding it. Unlike other wielders of the staff, May was able to control her anger and therefore control her strength.
Abilities
May fighting an assassin with her attacks
Master Martial Artist: May is one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s best martial artists, possessing more black belts than the notorious Black Widow. For one, she practices tai chi. May was able to take down a Centipede assassin and beat Grant Ward in a sparring match and twice again, once when he was under the influence of Lorelei and the other time when they fought at Cybertek. Agent 33 underestimated May in their fight because both were trained by S.H.I.E.L.D. Even after being tortured she was able to defeat Agent 33. May has also subdued opponents far stronger than humans such as Kree, LMDs, Primitives, and Remorath in close quarters. Her sense of fighting is so instinctive that she was able to circumvent Ben's mind-reading ability. Even while not at her peak condition, she has displayed the ability to defeat a squad of HYDRA soldiers in hand to hand combat. May was able to defeat the three of Sarge's crew, Pax, Jaco, and Snowflake on her own, with the two latter one-on-two. She has been overcome in physical combat on very few occasions, especially by opponents with superhuman strength, such as Michael Peterson when he took her by surprise in an alley in Los Angeles, or the Asgardian Lorelei, and Eva Belyakov; although in the end, May managed to reverse the situation and eliminate Belyakov.
Sword Mastery: May is an experienced swordsman as she wielded Sarge's Sword with great effect against Izel in a sword fight and killed her with it.
Expert Marksman: May prefers not to use firearms during her missions unless strictly necessary, generally preferring her melee combat and improvisational skills. If forced to use them, May usually chooses handguns as her weapon, even when the agents that accompany her equip assault weapons. She has displayed high accuracy, being able to kill most of her enemies with a single shot, or being able to shoot Lance Hunter in the shoulder to avoid compromising Jemma Simmons' mission cover within HYDRA. May is also skilled in throwing knives, as she used one to kill Luca Russo.
Master Acrobat: May is exceptionally athletic, and can be seen using her acrobatic skills to her advantage. She was able to surpass the speed of a running Cybertek security guard by doing multiple handsprings to take him out. Her reflexes, quickness, and coordination are remarkable enough to evade the rope dart knife of elite assassin Marcus Scarlotti, dodge Sinara's orbs with a heavily wounded leg, and flip through active gunfire while returning accurate shots of her own.
Master Spy: To be added
Gifted Intellect: To be added
Expert Tactician: To be added
Master Pilot: May is a highly proficient pilot, able to perform such feats as flying through the eye of a storm with a plane as large as the Bus, or deceiving a series of HYDRA Quinjets into believing the plane had been destroyed using a clever cloaking maneuver. She, as mission commander, is usually in charge of piloting the Quinjet as well. After being ambushed and sent into the future May was able to use her knowledge and skill to effectively fly and dock the Trawler through the debris field of what was once Earth despite having never flown a spaceship. Since then she has received training from Tess and is now a competent spacecraft pilot even able to efficiently return to the Lighthouse from the Earth fragment 616 on a cut off and depleting fuel supply.
Multilingualism: May is fluent in English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Spanish. She used this skill in missions in Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands, and Miami, respectively. She stated to know Russian, but claims she makes incorrect pronunciations.
Equipment
Weapons
Despite being well-trained in the use of all kind of firearms, Melinda May prefers the use of her martial arts skill and unarmed combat unless the situation requires it. In case she needs a weapon, she prefers to use small handguns even while her teammates are using high caliber weapons.

Glock 17: May carried the standard sidearm used by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents during one of her first missions with Phil Coulson as the specialist sent to help him retrieve an item found at the Burkov Mining Facility. She drew it while clearing the facility, without having to use it.
Ruger GP100: May infiltrated along the building in Bahrain where Eva Belyakov had retreated, in hopes of rescuing a young girl that was kidnapped and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that went before her. However, May did not know that the girl, Belyakov's daughter Katya Belyakov, was responsible for controlling her mother, some Bahraini local mobsters and even the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, so she was forced to kill Katya, using a Ruger GP100 revolver carried by one of the Bahraini criminals.
Smith & Wesson M&P Compact: May has used the compact version of the Smith & Wesson M&P during missions that required high mobility, such as the assault on an abandoned facility to apprehend Deathlok and hopefully tracking down the Clairvoyant, finding Thomas Nash inside the building.
May arming herself with dual pistols
Glock 19C: May took a Glock 19C from a disarmed soldier from the Policia Militar del Perú in Llactapata and threatened the other soldiers before Phil Coulson defused the situation.
Auto-Ordnance M1911A1: May took an Auto-Ordnance M1911A1 from a disarmed soldier from the Policia Militar del Perú in Llactapata and threatened the other soldiers before Phil Coulson defused the situation.
Smith & Wesson M&P: The Smith & Wesson M&P pistol is the standard sidearm carried by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, and, as such, May has used it to threaten or shoot most of her enemies. She used it during the assault on the Maribel del Mar, to kill HYDRA operatives, stop Donnie Gill and even to shoot at Lance Hunter to prevent him from unawarely killing Jemma Simmons. She also used it to threaten Grant Ward when he kidnapped Skye on the Bus, to shoot at Bobbi Morse when it was revealed that she had infiltrated the Playground as a member of the S.H.I.E.L.D. faction led by Robert Gonzales, and to kill many HYDRA operatives in a mission to rescue Deathlok and Lincoln Campbell in a HYDRA base in the Arctic. She continued to use it to rescue Hunter when they raided Grant Ward's warehouse, and was forced to take one by Alphonso Mackenzie when S.H.I.E.L.D. made an attempt to kill Hive in Union City. She became accustomed to carrying it around during the missions she led with her own assault team that required the use of lethal force, such as when they broke into the Pasadena Momentum Laboratory or the Roxxon Power Plant following Eli Morrow's kidnapping. While being possessed by Izel, May used her handgun to shoot at Sarge at point-blank range, effectively killing him, despite he was later able to resurrect. May also used it to rescue Daisy Johnson, shooting at Nathaniel Malick right after he killed Jiaying, forcing him to escape.
May aiming a gun at Andrew Garner
Tokyo Marui Strike Warrior: May took one of the guns discarded by an ATCU operative when she was kidnapped by her husband Andrew Garner. She convinced Lash to revert back to his human form, only to shoot at him with the gun and place him inside a Containment Module. May was not sure if the shots would kill Garner, though they only triggered his transformation into Lash.
FN Five-seveN USG: May carried this handgun as her standard issue sidearm as a member of HYDRA, using it to threaten prisoners such as Vijay Nadeer, to chase Daisy Johnson within the Triskelion when she was revealed as a traitor to HYDRA, or to escape with Johnson when May herself defected from the organization, killing many HYDRA agents to do so.
Makarov PM: May took Sarge's gun to threaten him inside his truck when they learnt that their mission headed to the Shrike Tower involved an Atom Bomb, though Sarge was able to lock himself up in the truck's cabin.
Heckler & Koch MP5K-PDW: May was given one of these weapons by Lance Hunter and Joey Gutierrez, who took many of them from the HYDRA operatives they had already knocked unconscious in order to barricade themselves inside the portal chamber of the HYDRA Castle. and used it to escape from the castle following Alphonso Mackenzie's orders.
FN P90: Within the Framework, May took this weapon from one of the members of her squad when they were sent to the HYDRA Enlightenment Cultivation Center in order to kill the Patriot. She entered into the Quarantine building and was about to open fire until she realized it was actually kids being held there, so after threatening the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents inside, she discarded the weapon to help them.
M18 Smoke Grenade: May and Yo-Yo Rodriguez used these grenades to enter the laboratory inside Area 51, in order to make the civilian staff leave and thus reveal who was the Chronicom that had infiltrated.
Night-Night Gun: May coldly used a Night-Night Gun to incapacitate Hannah Hutchins when she believed that she was a telekinetic whose powers were going out of control.
I.C.E.R.: May tested the I.C.E.R.s as Leo Fitz showed them to his teammates during their mission to capture the rogue Asgardian Lorelei. She has used it during missions that required the use of non-lethal force, such as her attempts to prevent her teammates from discovering her direct line to Nick Fury, the attack against the Cybertek Manufacturing Facility, the infiltration into the Government Storage Warehouse or the extraction of Raina in Vancouver.
May wielding the Berserker Staff
Berserker Staff: Melinda May grabbed the Berserker Staff from Grant Ward while confronting a group of Norse Paganists, gaining superhuman strength to defeat Petra Larsen and the last remaining paganists. She also took it from Kaminsky in Cuba, using it to demolish the Barbershop Headquarters over a group of Centipede Soldiers.
Kree Battle Axe: May reclaimed a Kree Battle Axe when fighting against two members of the Kree Watch. She wielded the axe during her fight against Sinara, but due to her wound she was overpowered and defeated nonetheless.
Knife: May used a knife to fight against the Kree Watch when S.H.I.E.L.D. returned to the Lighthouse and released a group of Inhumans.
Metal Rod: During the Siege of the Lighthouse, May was given a metal rod to fight against the Remorath as they were resistant to bullets.
Remorath Claws: While trying to escape from Qovas' Ship, May extracted the metal claws of a deceased Remorath in prevision for a fight. She used them against Qovas and managed to withstand his assaults with these claws despite the fact that they were shorter than Qovas'.
Shrike Daggers: When May was captured by Sarge, he put her through an initiation to kill a host infected with a Shrike. When the host began to transform, May picked up the knife and stabbed the Shrike. When she was later trapped in Sarge's Truck with a swarm of Shrikes approaching them, May armed herself with a knife and stabbed one as it went for Deke Shaw.
Sarge's Sword: May used this sword against Izel in a sword fight and killed her with it. She then threw the sword at Mackenzie so he could use it to kill Sarge.
Other Equipment
Heat Signature Detector: In order to track pyrokinetic Chan Ho Yin, May used a Heat Signature Detector device inside a Centipede Project laboratory in Hong Kong, easily finding his location within the building.
Infrared Goggles: A pair of goggles able to see the infrared spectrum, that May used to locate a package delivered by Cybertek to Ian Quinn in Italy.
May's Catsuit being worn during her missions
Tactical Parachute: May wore a Tactical Parachute while walking over the train sporting the Cybertek package, as a safety measure in case of need. She ended up using it when a member of the security team started to shoot her, and she was forced to jump of the train.
UHF Pin: May wore this pin during her undercover mission at Cybertek Corporate Headquarters, allowing Skye to scan the UHF signals to access information. However, as she found nothing, May and Phil Coulson had to examine the building, finding that all Cybertek files were hard copies.
S.H.I.E.L.D. Uniforms: May wore two S.H.I.E.L.D. uniforms during her time as a member of Coulson's Team, prior to the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D.. Her primary uniform consisted of a skintight blue shirt with finger hooks and the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo on both shoulders, a leather vest that extended past her waist, black pants, and tall, black boots. She wore a variation of this during her first mission with Coulson's Team, which consisted of a black version of her blue shirt, a blue leather vest with a large belt, black combat pants, and low, black boots. May wore a black catsuit while on a mission to apprehend Ian Quinn in Italy. During her work with Coulson's S.H.I.E.L.D., May mostly abandoned her primary uniform and during missions often wore simply a blue and black leather jacket.
Framework Headset: To be added
Metrics: In order to blend in among humans on the Lighthouse, May had a Metric implanted in her wrist.

Facilities
S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy of Operations: May studied at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy of Operations, where she learned to become one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s best agents.
Maria Hill's Field Office: Due to the trauma resulting from the Rescue in Bahrain, May asked to be assigned to an office job and ended working in Maria Hill's field office. However, she was taken out of this boring job by Phil Coulson, who enlisted her in his team as the pilot of the Bus.
Providence: May fled with the rest of her team after the HYDRA Uprising and sought refuge in Nick Fury's secret base Providence. However, unlike her teammates, she chose to temporarily leave the team as Coulson no longer trusted her due to her secret arrangement with Fury.
Playground: May was present when S.H.I.E.L.D. took possession of the Playground, another of Nick Fury's secret bases. She quickly became an essential part of the new S.H.I.E.L.D., agreeing to stay in the Playground when Robert Gonzales took over the base, but once again chose to temporarily leave the base after the War Against the Inhumans. May eventually returned as a full time S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, being even assigned her own team to train and work with at the time of Jeffrey Mace's directorship. However, May was eventually kidnapped by Aida and never got the chance to return to the Playground before it was destroyed by an LMD of herself.
Lighthouse: Along with most of her teammates, May was sent into the 2091 Lighthouse, where she blended among the population by becoming a pilot for the Trawler. She eventually managed to return into her time and remained in the Lighthouse to help her friends to avert the Destruction of Earth. Due to retiring from S.H.I.E.L.D., May temporarily left the Lighthouse behind her, but eventually returned after Phil Coulson passed away.
Coulson Academy: To be added
In the Framework
Triskelion: As a high-ranking HYDRA operative, May was stationed at the Triskelion, being often seen in the facility's corridors when not in mission. She frequently reported her missions to the highest authorities of HYDRA, namely Madame Hydra and The Doctor. May eventually left the Triskelion when she defected for S.H.I.E.L.D..
Playground: Since she defected from HYDRA, May was allowed to access the S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, the Playground. She helped the refugees who were being persecuted by HYDRA and provided Daisy Johnson with footage of the Infiltration into the HYDRA Enlightenment Cultivation Center to make amends for her actions as a HYDRA operative.

Trivia
Due to her popularity, Melinda May was introduced into the mainstream Marvel Comics universe.
In the comics, The Cavalry is the name of a Georgia-based superhero team.
Melinda May is the title of a song written by Stephen Foster and published in 1851.
May hates coffee and high heels.
According to Andrew Garner, May loves Las Vegas.
The pose May took before fighting Izel is similar to the one Mulan adopts during her battle against Shan You at the end of the 1998 animated film Mulan. May's actress, Ming-Na Wen, voiced Mulan in the film.
Wen later confirmed that the pose was done as a tribute to Mulan.
Wen later confirmed that the pose was done as a tribute to Mulan.
May used the alias Chastity McBryde. In the comics, McBryde was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent tasked with apprehending Elektra.
The S.H.I.E.L.D. uniforms that May and Phil Coulson wore in 1976 were reminiscent of the classic costumes from the comics.
Behind the Scenes
This character was originally listed with the name Agent Althea Rice (a.k.a. The Cavalry) on casting sheets. However, the name was changed once Ming-Na Wen was chosen for the part, to avoid the controversy of calling an Asian woman "Agent Rice".
Ming Qiu, Samantha Jo, Lauren Mary Kim, Natalie Padilla, Kristina Baskett, Cassie Lee Minick, Tara Macken, Ellette Craddock and Thekla Hutyra were stunt doubles for Ming-Na Wen in the role of Melinda May.
Alice Chen was a stand-in for Ming-Na Wen in the role of Melinda May.
