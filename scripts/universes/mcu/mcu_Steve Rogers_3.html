<html><p>As the group attempted to learn Loki's primary objective and why he had just allowed himself to be captured by them, Tony Stark arrived with Phil Coulson on the bridge and explained exactly why Loki now needed to use Iridium and Erik Selvig's knowledge to stabilize and harness the Tesseract's energy to open a portal. Rogers questioned what kind of Power Source Loki would need which Stark and Bruce Banner discussed in detail. They then discussed Loki's Scepter, with Fury comparing its power of brainwashing to the Wizard of Oz, which excited Rogers as he had finally understood this reference.

Rogers checking in on Tony Stark's progress
Upon Fury's request, Banner had teamed up with Stark to locate the Tesseract. Rogers walked in on Stark attempting to provoke Banner into turning into Hulk, and confronted him about the potential danger he could cause, demanding that he instead resume the task of finding the location of the Tesseract. Stark, however, revealed that his primary focus had become learning exactly why S.H.I.E.L.D. had brought them all together and what Director Fury was planning for bringing them together at this time. Rogers then questioned if Stark thought Fury was hiding something important from all of them, which Stark had confirmed as he noted that Fury was still a spy.

Rogers and Stark discuss Nick Fury's motives
Stark then forced Doctor Banner revealed his own misgivings about S.H.I.E.L.D.'s motivations behind researching the Tesseract in the first place, with Banner noting that Loki's quote about a warm light for all mankind, while he was being interrogated, might have been a reference to Stark Tower back in New York City. Stark then revealed that he was using J.A.R.V.I.S. to hack into the Helicarrier in order to learn what Fury was hiding for them, which made Rogers incredibly uncomfortable, leading to Rogers accusing Stark of refusing to stay focused on defeating Loki, which Stark insisted was not true.

Rogers discovers secret HYDRA equipment
Becoming initially doubtful of their theories, Rogers ordered Stark to go back to tracking down the Tesseract before he then went off and searched the storage areas of the Helicarrier. Sneaking into closed off parts of the ship, Rogers had eventually discovered what Fury was seemingly hiding from them. Opening a box hidden in one of the rooms, Rogers found HYDRA weaponry and technology, including the Arnimhilation 99L Assault Weapons which had been used by the Red Skull and surmised that S.H.I.E.L.D. was in fact attempting to harness all the power of the Tesseract to create similar weapons to these.

Avengers Argument
Rogers with Tony Stark during the argument
As Rogers returned with the Arnimhilation 99L Assault Weapon, he had personally confronted Director Nick Fury about his secret intentions to use the Tesseract to make weapons based on the Red Skull's original designs. An intense argument broke out between the team with Director Fury and the other members of the Avengers as they demanded information on Phase 2, until Fury confessed to be finding ways to protect Earth from Asgardians and other powerful cosmic beings.

Rogers telling Tony Stark he's not a true hero
As the argument intensified, Thor explained that it was Fury's work with the Tesseract that had attracted Loki and his allies to it, leading to Stark comparing Phase 2 to a nuclear detergent, while Rogers and Fury made a comment on how Stark Industries had previously made money building weapons for the United States Armed Forces. While Rogers and Tony Stark argued on the ethics of heroism, Rogers had argued that Stark was not the type of man who would make the real sacrifice, while Stark argued that the only reason Rogers was special was due to Howard Stark's work with the Super Soldier Serum.

Rogers advising Bruce Banner to remain calm
With everyone agreeing that they were being manipulated by Fury, Doctor Bruce Banner claimed that the Avengers were not a team but a time bomb. As Stark made jokes, Rogers began to lose his temper as he threatened to fight Stark, leading to Thor laughing at them. Finally, Banner began confronting everyone, confessing to have once tried to end his own life before picking up the Scepter as he became more angry. Seeing this, Rogers managed to get through to him as Banner realized that Loki had been manipulating all of them while he was on the Helicarrier which is what had led to the argument.

Attack on the Helicarrier
Captain America tries to fix the Helicarrier
As the group's argument came to a head, the Helicarrier came under attack by Hawkeye, who fired one of his Explosive Arrows to damage one of the Helicarrier's engines, threatening to make it fall out of the sky. This forced Captain America and Iron Man to put aside their differences and work together to help to save the damaged ship before it was too late. While Iron Man repaired the turbine, Captain America first checked the computer relays, which he struggled with due to his personal lack of understanding of modern technology.

Captain America shooting at the attackers
Once he had completed his task, Rogers was informed that Iron Man would be restarting the Helicarrier's propellers himself, and therefore he needed Rogers to pull a red lever when he called him to allow Iron Man to get free before he was shredded. However, as Rogers waited for Iron Man's signal, he was forced to fend off Loki's brainwashed agents, with one attempting to throw his grenade to further damage the propellers which Rogers managed to block before firing at them with a machine gun as he desperately attempted to keep them at bay while Iron Man was working on restarting the engines.

Captain America almost falling to his death
However, while Rogers was still engaged with his firefight, the entire Helicarrier began to fall to its side as Clint Barton had successfully gotten past Nick Fury and Maria Hill before using yet another one of his Trick Arrows to shut down the Helicarrier's power. With Loki's agent still firing at him while the Helicarrier tilted, Rogers had lost his footing and fell from the platform, barely holding on by grabbing a wire. Meanwhile, Iron Man began requesting that Rogers pull the lever as requested, forcing Rogers to use his strength to pull himself back onto the platform while still avoiding all the enemy gunfire.

Rogers learning of Phil Coulson's demise
Rogers was just able to pull the lever as required moments before Iron Man would have been shredded in the propeller blades, allowing Iron Man to fly to his aid and knock out the final one of Loki's agent before he could shoot Rogers. Rogers and Stark then learned that during the ensuing battle, both Thor and Hulk were thrown from the Helicarrier and now their locations were currently still unknown, while agent Phil Coulson had tragically been killed when he was impaled through the back with Loki's Scepter moments before Loki managed to make his successful his own escape from the Helicarrier.

Mourning Phil Coulson
Rogers looks at Coulson's vintage cards
Following the Attack on the Helicarrier, Rogers and Tony Stark had a meeting with Director Nick Fury to discuss what to do next following these events. Fury showed Rogers Agent Phil Coulson's vintage Captain America Card Collection which he had not managed to sign before his death, while Rogers saw them stained with Coulson's blood. Fury explained his intention to form the Avengers fight the battles that S.H.I.E.L.D. never could, noting Stark knew about this.

Rogers and Tony Stark discuss Phil Coulson
Stark left the meeting early and went to the spot where Coulson had died while he had been trying to save Thor's life. Rogers spoke with him there, questioning if Coulson was married and learning of his relationship with a cellist. When Rogers called Coulson a good man, Stark claimed that he was an idiot for not waiting for backup before engaging in the fight. While Rogers tried to get his mind back on the mission and focused on Loki, he questioned if his was the first time Stark had ever lost a fellow soldier, leading to Stark claiming they were not soldiers and refusing to fight for Fury anymore.

Rogers realizes where Loki has escaped to
As Rogers continued trying to keep Stark focused, he noted that Loki needed a power source for the Tesseract and they needed to focus on figuring out where this could be. When Stark noted that in killing Coulson and trying to tear them apart, Loki had made this conflict personal, noting that this was entirely the point as Loki wanted to be seen being victorious over the Earth. All Rogers' own attempts to get through to him worked, while Stark realized that Loki required Stark Tower back in New York City to power the Tesseract as this had been designed to create self sustaining energy which Loki needed.

Battle of New York
Recruiting the Avengers
Rogers recruits Black Widow and Hawkeye
The death of Phil Coulson was would finally bring the team together. Regardless of all he had been through thus far in the modern world, Rogers soon found the strength to do what needed to be done and take command of the Avengers as their new leader. As Iron Man flew into New York City and confronted Loki directly, Rogers and Natasha Romanoff teamed up with the recently recovered Clint Barton, who had just been successfully freed from Loki's mind control.

Captain America successfully taking a Quinjet
Having put on his uniform and collected his shield, Captain America alongside Romanoff and Barton had then matched together inside the hanger and took over a Quinjet which was being watched by Agent Tyler who tried to stop them but was instead ordered to leave by Rogers, as Tyler offered no further resistance. Despite their direct orders from Director Nick Fury and Maria Hill to stay onboard while they still continued repairing their own ship and gathering their intelligence back, Barton piloted the Quinjet off the Helicarrier instead as they flew away to New York in order to assist Iron Man.

Rogers witnessing the arrival of the Chitauri
When they eventually arrived in New York, they discovered to their horror that Loki had already succeeded in his plan as a portal had opened from Stark Tower above the city and the Chitauri army had begun their attack. As Loki engaged in a fight against Thor, a blast from Loki's Scepter caused their Quinjet was shot down, but they were all able to survive the crash due to Barton's flying skills. As they ran out inside the streets, Captain America looked up into the portal and saw a monstrous Leviathan flying down and laying waste to the city, with even more Chitauri warriors leaping off the Leviathan.

Captain America avoids the Chitauri's attacks
Seeing the countless forces still attacking from their portal, Captain America took cover beside Black Widow and Hawkeye and noticed Loki riding one of the Chitauri Chariots and firing down upon all the innocent bystanders. Knowing that he had to get the people out of harms way, Captain America had agreed to leave Black Widow and Hawkeye to fight off the Chitauri soldiers on the ground while he ran ahead. Leaping off the bridge, Captain America then jumped from a crashed bus, which was promptly destroyed by Chitauri fire before running down the streets as fast as he possibly could.

Captain America orders officers to help people
As Rogers felt his priority should be ensuring the protection of the endangered civilians, he ran to the nearest officers of the New York City Police Department, dodging the Chituari attacks as he went. Finding Officers Silva and Saunders, Captain America gave him orders for how to ensure the safety of the people. Officer Silva questioned why he should take orders from Rogers, but before he could answer, he was attacked by three Chitauri soldiers who he defeated with ease. Seeing Captain America's strength and skill in battle, Officer Silva decided to instead follow his orders.

Fighting the Chitauri
Captain America regrouping back with Thor
Having just ensured the safety of the innocent bystanders during all of the chaos, Captain America then regrouped with Black Widow and Hawkeye who were still fighting back against the Chitauri, using their guns and bow and arrows as their primary weapons against the invaders. They were then joined by Thor, who confirmed that the Tesseract could not be damaged as they agreed to focus of the attacking army for the time being as Rogers came up with their battle plan.

Captain America leading the Avengers
Before Rogers could continue working out his battle plan, they were joined by Bruce Banner who commented on the horror around them. When they witnessed a Leviathan coming towards them, Rogers had advised Banner to get angry as Banner noted that his secret was that he was always angry before he transformed into Hulk and then destroyed the Leviathan, as Rogers used his shield to protect Black Widow from the explosion. With the Avengers assembled, Rogers proved his tactical genius by giving each member their assignment in order to fight back against the massive invading alien army.

Captain America ordering Hulk to smash
Captain America ordered Hawkeye to stake out from a building to call out patterns and any strays, Iron Man to provide air support and superiority, Thor to use Mjølnir's lightning blasts to bottleneck the portal, therefore preventing any reinforcements from coming through. As the others went off to complete their tasks, Captain America told Black Widow that they would fight together in order to keep the fighting on the ground, and for Hulk to simply do what he does best: smash. Rogers then fought beside Romanoff to take on countless numbers of Chitauri troops that were coming their way.

Captain America fighting with Black Widow
While the battle went ahead and the Avengers did their duty, Captain America assisted Black Widow as she was fighting just one Chitauri soldier, using her own bite to stun the alien before turning his staff back on it. As they overlooked the burning battlefield, Rogers noted that they had to find someway of closing the Tesseract's portal in order to end the invasion. Romanoff decided to go to the top of Stark Tower herself and attempt to close it, asking Rogers to help her by launching her up in the air and allowing her to catch a ride on one of the Chitauri Chariots flying overhead.

Captain America and Iron Man fight together
While Romanoff flew across the battlefield in order to get near to the Tesseract and speak with Erik Selvig about how they could stop it, Captain America found himself surrounded by the alien forces who fired their guns at him. While Captain America held them back on his own, he was eventually rejoined by Iron Man, who flew down, knocking several of the aliens off the bridge before they then teamed up as Iron Man fired a beam of energy at his shield which deflected and intensified the beam as he knocked back and killed several more of the attacking Chitauri forces.

Rogers goes to the aid of several civilians
While he was taking out yet another Chitauri soldier who had pinned him down, Rogers had heard from Clint Barton that the Chitauri had taken a large group of over five dozen innocent civilians as their hostages inside of a nearby bank, with these hostages also including the waitress Beth who he had previously met. These aliens prepared to execute them with an explosion, but Captain America dived into the building used his shield to take down the lead Chitauri. In his desperate attempt to save the innocent civilians, Rogers began to take out this entire battalion of the invaders by himself.

Captain America is thrown out of the building
However, during the fight, Captain America's Helmet was torn off his face before he knocked back the other Chitauri soldier behind him. Looking up, Rogers realized that a Helmetless Chitauri and picked the Chitauri Bomb back up, while Rogers dived for his shield which saved him from the explosion, although he was still blasted out the building, landing hard on a nearby car. As Captain America painfully got back to his feet, he watched as members of the United States Armed Forces and New York City Police Department then took all of the terrified civilians away from the still active danger zone.

Closing the Portal
Captain America and Thor fighting together
Rejoining their battle against this Chitauri Invasion, Captain America was soon partnered with Thor, together taking out wave after wave of enemies. Rogers had taken a direct hit on the side from a Chitauri staff, which injured him. However, he still refused to stop fighting. Eventually, Gideon Malick and the rest of the World Security Council decided to drop a nuclear bomb onto New York City, stopping the Chitauri from taking over their world, but would kill the Avengers and civilians, and destroy Manhattan in the process.

Rogers watches Iron Man fly into the portal
Once the missile had been launched, Director Nick Fury immediately informed Iron Man of the bomb coming straight for them with mere minutes to spare. Despite Black Widow noting that she could use the Scepter to close the Tesseract's portal, Stark told Rogers not to give the order yet as he managed to fly the bomb through the portal and have it destroy the Chitauri Command Center which in turn killed the Chitauri soldiers. However, it appeared that Stark had been killed in the explosion. Seeing no other choice, Rogers ordered Romanoff to close the portal, thus saving the entire Earth from conquest.

Captain America declaring their own victory
Just as the portal was being closed, they discovered that Stark had managed to survive: However, he was unconscious and tumbling down to the ground at some speed. Stark was saved from the fall back to Earth by Hulk as Rogers and Thor quickly ran to his aid. They discovered Stark's heart was not beating; however, Hulk managed to scare him awake with a roar. When he awoke, Rogers informed Stark that they had won the war. Rogers then joined all the other Avengers going up to Stark Tower in order to recapture Loki who, knowing he was defeated, finally surrendered without any resistance. The rest of the Avengers then proceeded to go down to the first floor to meet with Alexander Pierce and his agents while Captain America stayed behind to coordinate a search and rescue team.

Departing the Avengers
Rogers watches the Tesseract leaving Earth
Following their victory in the Chitauri Invasion and before they split up, Captain America and all of their other Avengers then ate silently together in the Shawarma Palace. While they were eating, they were interrupted by the arrival of War Machine, who arrived too late to help them in the battle. Sometime after the battle, they gathered in Central Park to see Thor return home to Asgard with the Tesseract with a bound and muzzled Loki, as Rogers closely watched the Tesseract's transportation.

Rogers shaking hands with Tony Stark
Once Thor had departed with Loki to bring him to justice by placing him into the Asgardian Dungeons, the rest of the Avengers then went their separate ways until the next time Earth needed its Mightiest Heroes to defend it from whatever threat came. Rogers personally shook hands with Tony Stark before Stark and Bruce Banner drove off together, as Rogers then rode off on his motorcycle to see what awaited him in this new world. Rogers was then soon employed by Director Nick Fury to come and work for S.H.I.E.L.D. as an agent, to allow him to continue defending the world from dangers.

Rogers riding away after the Avengers split up
Rogers moved to Washington, D.C., trying to adjust to living the 21st century. During his time with S.H.I.E.L.D., Rogers was also trained in both parkour and modern forms of combat to make him even more effective in the field. Rogers would often work with Black Widow as well as Brock Rumlow, as the three agents successfully took down a terrorist cell that had stolen the Zodiac. Rogers and Romanoff also saved the Nobel-price-winning scientist Professor Sana Amanat was in danger of an abduction by the highly dangerous mercenary group known as the Cadre by working together as a close unit.

School Discipline
Captain America's educational videos
Sometime following the Battle of New York, Captain America, on the behalf of the Department of Education, was recruited to host his own fitness challenge for the United States's public schools, such as the Midtown School of Science and Technology. He also hosted a series of public service videos, which were dubbed Rappin' With Cap, covering various topics with the purpose of educating America's youth.

Rogers hosting his own Fitness Challenge
The topics Captain America had spoken about to the schoolchildren included fire hazards, the importance of a nutritional diet, human reproduction, the vitality of math and reading skills, tooth decay, head lice, and detention. In one of the videos, Rogers spoke long and hard about the virtue of patience, claiming it could be the key to victory or could potentially lead to very little and be somewhat disappointing for the person who had waited. Ironically, he grew impatient during filming and asked how many more videos were left.

S.H.I.E.L.D Agent
Meeting Sam Wilson
Rogers trains himself alongside Sam Wilson
While on an early morning jog in Washington, D.C., Rogers frequently overlapped a man; every time he passed him, Rogers jokingly called out to him "on your left." Rogers later caught up again with the man who introduced himself as Sam Wilson, a former air force veteran with the United States Armed Forces who was now working in the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Rogers introduces himself to Sam Wilson
Wilson was able to fully understand Rogers' experiences of being a veteran returning home from World War II and all of the difficulties surrounding that experience, with the pair discussing how sleeping on a comfortable bed had become much more difficult for them. Rogers listed off all the ways that living in 2014 was not as bad as it might appear, pointing out how helpful the internet was with helping him catch up with what he had missed while frozen. The two talked about their lives and Wilson recommended some music for Rogers to listen to, including Marvin Gaye, which he added to his list of things in the new world he had to watch, listen to or experience.

Rogers being collected by Natasha Romanoff
They were interrupted when Natasha Romanoff arrived to pick Rogers up for his newest S.H.I.E.L.D. mission after texting him. As Rogers was leaving, he teased Wilson by inviting him to go running some other time while Wilson then invited Rogers to come and join him at a meeting for those suffering from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, which Rogers then promised to do so. As Romanoff pulled up, she jokingly asked where the Smithsonian was, comparing Rogers to a fossil.

Retaking of the Lemurian Star
Rogers and Black Widow listen to the mission
Taken on board a Quinjet to be flown to the mission while also being debriefed, Rogers was told by Brock Rumlow that they needed to rescue hostages of Georges Batroc who had hijacked a S.H.I.E.L.D. ship, the Lemurian Star, somewhere in the Indian Ocean. Captain America ensured that he knew exactly how many hostages were on board, which included Jasper Sitwell, before complaining about Director Nick Fury sending them on missions like this to cover his errors. Captain America gave Rumlow and the other members of STRIKE their mission orders before then preparing to go into combat himself.

Captain America jumps out of the Quinjet
Rogers was tasked with attacking the ship first, as his own strength enhanced by the Super Soldier Serum would give him the advantage in the battle. As he prepared his own uniform for the mission, Rogers spoke with Natasha Romanoff who tried to set him up on a date, much to Rogers' disagreement as he still loved Peggy Carter and felt he had too much work. Much to Jack Rollins' surprise, Rogers then dived off the Quinjet into the ocean without a parachute to slow his descent.

Captain America fights against all the pirates
Having landed on the Lemurian Star alone, Captain America single-handedly defeated almost every pirate on the ship without raising the alarm. Using his shield to gain the advantage, he managed to get past teams of Batroc's soldiers before they could fight back. When one pirate came close to alerting Batroc, Captain America stopped him with a knife throw and was saved by Rumlow shooting another pirate before continuing on his mission.

Captain America targets Georges Batroc
Captain America requested that Black Widow give him an update, but she was busy subduing Gerald Durand along with all of Batroc's pirates. Once Black Widow was in position and had ensured that the ship would not be moving, Rogers ordered STRIKE to get ready as Rumlow shot the remaining pirates and rescued the hostages while Romanoff cleared out the engine room. As Rumlow's team engaged the pirates, Captain America threw his shield at Batroc, who made his escape.

Captain America encounters Georges Batroc
With Sitwell and the other hostages now safe, Captain America then went searching for Batroc, while Rumlow then informed him that Romanoff had seemingly vanished during the mission and not met with STRIKE like she was supposed to. Before he could find out where Romanoff was, Captain America was suddenly ambushed by Batroc. The pirate taunted Captain America about relying on his shield or other weapons.

Captain America fighting Georges Batroc
Accepting Batroc's other to fight by speaking in French, Captain America then fought against him in purely hand-to-hand combat. During their battle, Captain America discovered that Batroc was a more formidable fighter than he had anticipated as he had able to deflect all of his own attacks. Despite Batroc's continued attempts to kill him, Captain America proved to have the advantage due to the Serum inside his veins, which Batroc did not stand a chance against. Eventually, Captain America won and knocked Batroc out by smashing him through a locked door and knocking him out with a final hard punch.

Captain America confronting Black Widow
After the fight, Rogers discovered Romanoff hacking into the ship's computer. He learned she had a secret assignment to recover some S.H.I.E.L.D. data from the ship through a USB drive. This somewhat annoyed Rogers, who was unhappy at being kept in the dark about the fact that Romanoff had now been given a secondary mission by Fury. The situation was made worse when Batroc woke up and threw a grenade at the pair. Rogers deflected the grenade with his shield and they leaped out of the path of the explosion. They both survived the explosion, but Batroc escaped during the chaos. Rogers made it clear he blamed Romanoff for the failure to capture him.

Project Insight
Captain America confronts Director Nick Fury
Reporting back to Director Nick Fury at the Triskelion, Rogers then expressed his anger with Fury over lying to him. Rogers claimed that Fury's plan to give Black Widow a secret order endangered the entire mission, noting that his own team should be able to trust each other. Fury argued that he had sent in Captain America purely so that this did not happen and that the last time he trusted someone, he lost an eye. Eventually, Fury promised Rogers that he would now be more honest with him.

Rogers and Nick Fury with the Helicarriers
Fury then took Rogers to the facility's sub-levels, telling a story along the way of how his own Grandfather used to carry a large gun with him at all times in order to ensure he was never mugged for his lunch bag. Fury told Rogers that S.H.I.E.L.D. had something bigger than his Grandfather's gun as he showed him the new Helicarriers were being constructed in the hangar, with brand new technology and weapons designed by Tony Stark to make them more advanced.

Rogers refuses to support Project Insight
Introducing Rogers to Project Insight, Fury explained that S.H.I.E.L.D. now planned to use the Helicarriers to eliminate threats to the United States of America before they even happened. Rogers was discontent with this, finding S.H.I.E.L.D.'s newest methods to be too extreme. When Fury noted what Rogers' generation did during World War II, Rogers insisted this was not the same, claiming Fury was spreading fear and not freedom. When Fury insisted Rogers get behind the program, he refused and left.

Getting Advice
Rogers explores the Smithsonian Exhibition
Disillusioned by Director Nick Fury's new attitude towards national security, Rogers revisited his past by visiting the Captain America division of the Smithsonian Institution. There, he saw videos of his time in World War II with all of the Howling Commandos fighting against Red Skull. When a young boy recognized him, Rogers smiled and gestured him to keep quiet, which the amazed boy agreed to do.

Rogers watches an interview with Peggy Carter
Rogers found a memorial for Bucky Barnes, which presented him as Rogers' friend and the only member of the Howling Commandos to lose his life in the fight against HYDRA. Rogers then watched an interview with Peggy Carter where she discussed her relationship with Rogers and how he changed her life even after she believed him to have been killed in action. Carter told the story of when Rogers had saved over 1000 men, including the man who became her husband.

Rogers goes to visit Peggy Carter in her home
Rogers went to see Carter in her retirement home, now aged past ninety years. They discussed the changing world, and Rogers admitted that the reason he stayed at S.H.I.E.L.D. was partly because she helped found it. Rogers went on to express how he had hoped that now serving with S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers would help him find his place in the new world, but it just was not the same or as simple as it was during World War II. Carter then laughed that Rogers was always overdramatic about this sort of thing.

Rogers attempts to comfort Peggy Carter
Carter told Rogers that while he had saved the world, she and others had mucked it up while he had been gone. When Carter began to cough, Rogers handed her a glass of water. She looked up and appeared to have forgotten their entire conversation, reacting like she was seeing Rogers for the first time in seventy years; Carter had developed Alzheimer's in her old age. Though saddened, Rogers smiled and told Carter that he could never leave his best girl while she owed him a dance.

Rogers listens to Sam Wilson's speech
Seeking some new advice, Rogers decided to visit the Department of Veterans Affairs to listen to Sam Wilson talk to soldiers who were suffering from Posttraumatic stress disorder. Rogers found himself feeling at home around other United States Armed Forces veterans as he listened to their stories about how they had come home only to feel of out of place. Wilson offered them all whatever advice he could to try and help them move forward.

Rogers gets some life advice from Sam Wilson
Rogers spoke to Wilson after the meeting as they discussed what they were going through as former soldiers, with Wilson revealing that his friend and partner, Riley, was killed in action. When he questioned if Rogers was considering retiring, Rogers told Wilson that he had no idea what else to do with his life other than obey orders and serve. Wilson joked he could be the Ultimate Fighter before he encouraged Rogers he could do whatever it was that he wanted to do.

Loss of Nick Fury
Rogers returning to his own apartment
Riding his motorcycle back towards his apartment building late in the evening, Rogers parked it and then went upstairs towards his own apartment to rest, still considering both of his recent talks with Peggy Carter and Sam Wilson as well as his place within S.H.I.E.L.D. in the wake of learning of the new Project Insight. Rogers had strong disagreements about the moral implications of possibly supporting such a project, still believing that its use of preemptive targeting now promoted fear for America.

Rogers asks Kate out on a date
Once reaching his floor, Rogers had a brief talk with his neighbor, Kate, about how her work as a nurse was going. He even built up the courage to then ask Kate out on a date by offering to let her use his own washing machine in exchange for having a cup of coffee with him. However, Kate declined for the moment since her hospital scrubs had been exposed to germs, much to his slight disappointment. Rogers then became suspicious when Kate told him that she'd heard his stereo playing, which he had turned off.

Rogers finds Nick Fury hiding in his home
Rogers snuck into his apartment through the window and found Nick Fury sitting on his couch. Fury claimed to Rogers that his wife kicked him out; however, when Rogers turned on the lamp, he saw that Fury was severely injured. Fury revealed from his phone that they might be overheard by someone as enemies in S.H.I.E.L.D. were listening in. Fury told Rogers that only his friends knew the truth about him. Without warning, Fury was shot several times in his back through the wall, collapsing into Rogers' arms.

Rogers witnesses Nick Fury being shot down
With the remaining strength he had, Fury gave the Lemurian Star flash drive to Rogers and ordered him not to trust anyone before falling unconscious. While Rogers pulled Fury out of the way and behind cover, his neighbor then smashed in the door, armed with a gun and revealing herself to be Agent 13, hired by Fury to keep an eye on Rogers. Agent 13 called for medical assistance and explained the situation to S.H.I.E.L.D. while desperately trying to save Fury.

Rogers chases down Winter Soldier
Rogers spotted the assassin attempting to make his getaway, so he grabbed his shield and went in pursuit, leaping from his apartment window into the building across the street and leaving Agent 13 to take care of Fury. Rogers smashed his way through various office doors and was still barely able to keep up with the incredibly fast assassin. Using all of his strength, Rogers kept just behind the assassin until he saw a chance to confront him.

Rogers faces off against the Winter Soldier
Rogers eventually caught up and threw his shield at the assassin, but the masked assailant easily caught it with his cybernetic arm. Rogers was shocked at this as the two enemies locked eyes with each other before the assassin threw the shield back at Rogers with some considerable force. Rogers was so winded that he paused for just a moment, allowing the assassin to escape as Rogers looked out over the city for him.

Rogers watches Nick Fury's operation
Fury was taken to a hospital where Rogers rejoined him and observed the operation with Natasha Romanoff by his side. They watched together in horror as it was reported that Fury's heart had stopped. Rogers and Romanoff were joined by Maria Hill and other agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. as the doctors operated, but were unable to revive him and Doctor Fine pronounced him dead. Fury was taken away and Hill asked to take care of the body. Romanoff began to question Rogers about the identity of the shooter, predicting that the bullets used were Soviet upon hearing about his incredible speed and robotic arm, indicating she knew who the assassin was.

Rogers lies to Black Widow about Nick Fury
Upon being questioned by Romanoff about why Fury was inside his apartment, Rogers feigned ignorance about why Fury went to him. Before they could continue the discussion, Agent Brock Rumlow informed Rogers that he was wanted for a hearing at the Triskelion with Alexander Pierce to discuss what had happened. Romanoff told Rogers that he was a terrible liar. He then used this quiet moment to hide the USB Fury had given him in a vending machine.

Alexander Pierce's Warning
Rogers is introduced to Alexander Pierce
When he arrived at the Triskelion, Captain America had encountered Agent 13 again just as she left Alexander Pierce's office. As they passed one another, Rogers barely acknowledged her before shaking Pierce's hand, with Pierce claiming it was an honor to meet him as his own father had served with Rogers during World War II. Rogers was questioned by Pierce, who said he was one of Nick Fury's closest friends, explaining how they met in Bogotá and wanting to know who was responsible for Fury's death.

Rogers and Pierce discuss Director Nick Fury
Pierce questioned Rogers over why Fury had been in his apartment before they discussed how his home had been bugged, with Pierce noting that it was Fury himself who had done so. Pierce then showed Rogers video footage of Georges Batroc while he was being interrogated and revealed that Fury was secretly responsible for the hijacking of the Lemurian Star, the current theory being that he was attempting to cover up the sale of classified documents.

Rogers is given a warning by Alexander Pierce
Attempting to prove his own loyalty to Fury, Pierce told Rogers that he took a seat on the World Security Council because Fury had once asked him to, claiming that they both shared the idea that to build a better world sometimes meant tearing the old one down. Knowing that he could not trust Pierce, Rogers told him nothing of what Fury said, and left him to return to the hospital, despite Pierce's warning that he would not allow anybody to stand in his way.

Escape from the Triskelion
Captain America goes to leave the Triskelion
With his meeting completed, Rogers then got inside the elevator and prepared to leave the Triskelion. Before he could go down, however, Rogers was joined by Brock Rumlow who greeted him and expressed his own condolences for the death of Director Nick Fury, claiming that what had happened was messed up. As they went down, Rumlow noted that forensics had found hair fibers of Fury's possible killer on the rooftop, although Rogers recommended that they wait a bit longer before investigating personally, before the elevator then stopped and collected more some people.

Rogers realizing he's about to be ambushed
As the elevator slowly began to fill up with even more agents from STRIKE, Rogers quickly sensed that something was wrong. Once Jack Rollins stepped inside with his hand on his weapon, Rogers noted that another agent was sweating as he came to the conclusion that Alexander Pierce had organized an ambush for him for withholding information. Giving them all one chance to leave, Rogers asked if anyone wanted to get out, before the fight began.

Rogers fighting off all of his attackers
Losing all pretense, Rollins and these other agents attacked Rogers, who used his enhanced strength and martial arts training to gain the upper hand. As all of the attackers had successfully managed to disarm Rogers of his shield, they also attempted to use a pair of Magnetic Handcuffs to keep him from fighting back. However, they could only get one on as Rogers was unwilling to give in. Having only one free hand, Rogers fought off his opponents.

Rogers attempting to subdue Brock Rumlow
Despite Rumlow attempting to use his Taser Rod to subdue him, Rogers managed to break free of the magnetic handcuff and then proceeded to take out two more agents with considerable ease. Eventually, the last conscious double agent was Rumlow, who told Rogers that the fight was not personal. He attacked and managed to shock Rogers with the Taser Rod twice before Rogers disarmed him.

Finally, Rogers landed a hard strike against Rumlow before throwing him into the ceiling and knocking him out, replying that this attack did feel personal. As Rogers then attempted to find a way out of the building to avoid arrest, he discovered more STRIKE agents were coming to capture him, having been sent by Jasper Sitwell. Seemingly trapped, Rogers found that the only clear way out was to cut the elevator cables with his shield.

Rogers manages to escape from the elevator
Once the elevator stopped its free fall, Rogers realized that Sitwell and Pierce had sent agents onto every floor to capture him. He finally threw himself out of the elevator glass and fell several floors through the atrium of the Triskelion and onto the floor, using his shield to absorb the impact. While the horrified S.H.I.E.L.D. looked on, Rogers managed to get back on his feet despite being in considerable pain and then continued trying to escape, all while Sitwell watched this unfold on his monitors and ordered that Rogers be stopped.

Rogers about to face an attacking Quinjet
With little time left to spare in his escape as Sitwell had just authorized the Triskelion to be locked down, Rogers managed to run to and drive away on the back of his motorcycle, successfully escaping a roadblock set up for him. However, as Rogers rode straight down the bridge, he discovered that Sitwell had sent a Quinjet to stop him. Rogers remained unintimidated however, and instead continued driving straight towards the Quinjet, avoiding all of its gunfire.

Rogers manages to take down the Quinjet
Rogers managed to ride right up to the Quinjet before throwing his shield into one of its engines and launching himself onto its roof. From there, he proceeded to damage the Quinjet by throwing his shield at its back wings before leaping off, thus causing the jet to crash-land before Rogers escaped out into Washington, D.C.. In order to keep S.H.I.E.L.D. from tracking him, Rogers hid his uniform inside the duffle bag of a high school coach, whose clothes he took.

Hiding in Plain Sight
Rogers finds Natasha Romanoff took the USB
Having successfully escaped from the Triskelion ambush, but aware that Jasper Sitwell's agents were hunting him, the now disguised Rogers returned to the hospital, where he realized that the USB was gone from where he had hidden it inside the vending machine. As Rogers was looking for the USB, Natasha Romanoff appeared behind him, revealing that she had already taken it.

Rogers angrily questions Natasha Romanoff
Pushing her inside an empty room, Rogers aggressively questioned where the USB was, while Romanoff questioned why Nick Fury had given it to him. Upon being told that Fury indeed hired Georges Batroc to hijack the Lemurian Star, Romanoff confessed to knowing who killed him. She told Rogers that the masked man was an assassin called the Winter Soldier, credited with numerous assassinations in the last 50 years, and she had encountered him once before.

Rogers and Romanoff in disguise at the mall
Despite the high risk levels, the pair came to believe that they could still trust each other. Rogers and Romanoff both put on a quick disguise, with Rogers complaining about his shoes being too big for him, and went out in public looking for answers regarding what was happening. While Romanoff gave Rogers tips on going undercover, they then went to an Apple Store and used a laptop to open the USB, searching for any valuable information on it.

Rogers and Romanoff hack into the USB drive
While Romanoff hacked into the computer to access the USB drive, they were greeted by Aaron, who enthusiastically offered to help them. Romanoff managed to politely move him away by pretending to be Rogers' fiancée, as Aaron complimented how Rogers' glasses looked on him. With Rogers keeping an eye on the time as they knew S.H.I.E.L.D. would be able to trace the USB, Romanoff eventually triangulated where the drive could be unlocked down to New Jersey. Rogers recognized the coordinates as Camp Lehigh before insisting that they leave.

Rogers and Romanoff avoiding Brock Rumlow
Upon exiting the store, the two soon realized that STRIKE had already arrived. Rogers prepared to fight the agents but Romanoff instructed him on how to get out of the mall before Jack Rollins could find them. Trying to avoid being detected, Romanoff told Rogers to be intimate with her by holding her close and laughing. Spotting Brock Rumlow coming towards them, she responded by kissing Rogers publicly to deflect Rumlow's attention before they escaped, briefly throwing Rogers off.

Arnim Zola's Confession
Rogers speaks to Romanoff in their stolen car
Having gotten away from Brock Rumlow's STRIKE team just in time, Rogers and Natasha Romanoff then stole a car and drove to New Jersey. During their trip, Romanoff questioned where Rogers had learned to steal a car and he answered during World War II. She had then teased Rogers about if their kiss had been his first since the 1940s, which he firmly denied.

Rogers and Romanoff discuss their friendship
As they drove along, Rogers and Romanoff began discussing how she managed to hide her true self for so long, resulting in Rogers still not having a clear idea of who Romanoff was despite all of their time working together in both S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers. When she questioned who Rogers wanted her to be, he just told her to be his friend. Romanoff smiled at this and advised Rogers he might be in the wrong business if he was actually looking for friends.

Rogers and Romanoff arriving at Camp Lehigh
When they finally arrived at Wheaton that evening, Rogers returned to Camp Lehigh, the old training camp where he had once trained during World War II before undergoing Project Rebirth. While he and Romanoff explored the base, Rogers thought back to his days of training as Michael Duffy pushed him during running exercises, which the skinnier Rogers had struggled with. Eventually, he spotted an ammunition hut in the wrong place and went to investigate.

Rogers and Romanoff explore a secret bunker
Inside, they found a S.H.I.E.L.D. secret storage room which had been clearly left untouched for decades, with the walls featuring photographs of Howard Stark and Colonel Chester Phillips. Rogers was asked by Romanoff who Peggy Carter was upon seeing a photograph of her as well, which he avoided answering. Moving downstairs inside the facility, they came upon rows of old computers inside a S.H.I.E.L.D. office. There, they found a more modern looking USB slot and placed the drive inside it. 

Rogers and Romanoff speaking to Arnim Zola
The computers powered up as the voice of an A.I. activated, which recognized Rogers and Romanoff. The voice noted that he and Rogers had previously met back in 1945 before Captain America managed to capture him during World War II. Rogers quickly realized that the voice was that of Red Skull's scientist, Arnim Zola; Zola revealed that his consciousness had been uploaded into a computer before his death in 1972, allowing his own mind to continue living on.

Rogers learning of the survival of HYDRA
As Rogers listened on in horror, Zola explained to them how he had been recruited by Operation Paperclip after World War II's end, and from his new position as a part of S.H.I.E.L.D., he was able to quietly rebuild HYDRA within the United States. Rogers refused to believe this, but Zola accessed his data files and showed how HYDRA changed strategies following the war and began tricking the entire world into surrendering their own freedoms through decades of their careful manipulation.

Rogers realizes Arnim Zola was stalling them
While Zola explained that he had been working on an algorithm that HYDRA wanted, he told them that some of the deaths of S.H.I.E.L.D. leaders were due to HYDRA and showed a picture of Howard Stark, implying that his and his wife's fatal car crash might not have been a sudden accident. Hearing and seeing this, Rogers realized that Tony Stark's parents were killed by the Winter Soldier, just like Nick Fury. Zola revealed their goal was to lead to the world into accepting Project Insight to gain peace of mind, claiming this as HYDRA's ultimate victory.

Rogers escapes from HYDRA with Romanoff
Before Rogers and Romanoff could get any more information out of Zola, they realized that Alexander Pierce had sent a missile to their location. Zola locked them inside and, with seconds to spare, Rogers ripped out the floorboards and pulled Romanoff with him just as the missile blew up the facility. Rogers used his shield to keep the debris from crushing them. He then carried Romanoff out of the rubble and ran to safety just as Brock Rumlow's STRIKE team arrived.

Sam Wilson's Help
Rogers asking Sam Wilson for his assistance
Managing to escape from Camp Lehigh's destruction, Rogers and Natasha Romanoff then went to seek refuge. With just a few people they felt they could trust left, Rogers brought them to the home of Sam Wilson. Not wasting any time, he apologized to Wilson and explained that they were looking for somewhere to hide out, before Romanoff noted that everyone they knew was trying to kill them. Wilson allowed them to come in and recover from their ordeal.
