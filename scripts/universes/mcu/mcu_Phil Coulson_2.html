<html><p>Once they boarded the Helicarrier, Coulson introduced Rogers to Natasha Romanoff. Romanoff told Coulson that he was needed on the bridge. When he reached the bridge, Coulson informed Bruce Banner that they were searching for the Tesseract, using cell phone signals, cameras, and wireless phones to find its location.  

After the Avengers' first mission, Coulson said to Nick Fury that the team was not prepared to face their common enemy and that they needed to be motivated in some way. 

When Stark managed to capture Loki in Stuttgart, Germany, Thor suddenly appeared and tried to take Loki back to Asgard. It was agreed that Thor would join the Avengers in their mission against Loki. The group assembled on the Helicarrier, where Thor informed them of Loki's plan to conquer the planet with the army of the Chitauri.

Death
Coulson and Thor on board the Helicarrier
Later, Coulson met with Thor, informing him that Jane Foster had been moved to a secure location, when Loki returned and put Erik Selvig under his control. Thor thanked Coulson for protecting Foster and said he believed Selvig was a good man, noting that Loki would have targeted him because of his friendship with Thor. Coulson explained that Selvig often spoke of his encounter with Thor.

Coulson uses the Destroyer Gun against Loki
A brainwashed Clint Barton attacked the Helicarrier with a group of brainwashed mercenaries, allowing Loki to escape from his prison cell. When Coulson reached Loki's cell, he found the Asgardian free and Thor trapped in his place. Coulson threatened Loki with a weapon created from Asgardian technology. Coulson was unaware that he was aiming the weapon at an illusion, while the real Loki snuck up behind him and stabbed him in the heart with his Scepter.

Coulson says his "last words" to Nick Fury
Mortally wounded, Coulson could do nothing to prevent Loki from ejecting Thor from the Helicarrier. Coulson told Loki that he was going to lose, and fired on Loki with the Destroyer Gun, sending him crashing through a wall. Fury reached Coulson just before he died, and Coulson told him it was O.K., that his death would give the Avengers something to fight for. Later, when the battle was over and lost, Fury let his agents know that Coulson had been killed by Loki. Fury used Coulson's death to motivate the divided Avengers into working together as a team. With Coulson as their inspiration, the Avengers defeated Loki, preventing his invasion.

Resurrection
The Procedure
Coulson suffers a near mental breakdown
Days after Coulson died, Nick Fury had his body taken to the Guest House, where S.H.I.E.L.D. medical staff used an experimental drug to repair his damaged organs at a cellular level, as a part of Project T.A.H.I.T.I. It took at least seven operations, but Fury's doctors were able to bring Coulson back to life. The process was extremely agonizing for Coulson, who begged the doctors to let him die.

Coulson having his memory wiped
Not long after he was resurrected, Coulson began to experience the same mental breakdowns suffered by other patients of Project T.A.H.I.T.I. He began carving alien symbols and screaming at his doctors that he needed to know what the symbols meant. Fearing that he could suffer a horrible death, the doctors chose to erase his memory.

Coulson's recollection of the events after his fatal wounds
Nick Fury and J. Streiten ordered that some of his memories be altered  with a robotic-assisted neural micro-surgery, to make him believe that he had been revived in Tahiti. The fake memories were meant to help him cope with the pain. Coulson was also made to forget everything about Project T.A.H.I.T.I., including the fact he had headed the project. The details of his revival were restricted to Coulson. Streiten maintained that the methods used to restore Coulson to life were unethical and he felt that they should have let him die.

Recovery
Coulson was told that he had been dead for only eight seconds, but he suspected it was longer. He remembered being somewhere else, in a beautiful afterlife.  Later, Coulson rejoined S.H.I.E.L.D. He wrote a report for Nick Fury detailing Chitauri weaponry on the black market and recalled the events surrounding Benjamin Pollack and Claire Wise's bank robberies using a Chitauri Gun, which S.H.I.E.L.D. labeled "Item 47."

The New Team
Recruiting FitzSimmons
Coulson meets Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons
Coulson arranged a meeting with Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons to recruit them as agents for his team.

Coulson discussing FitzSimmons' work
When Fitz and Simmons arrived, they were both nervous to meet Coulson. Coulson thought that they were one person, because they were always referred to as "FitzSimmons". Coulson discussed their history at S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy, mentioning that they were the youngest students ever to graduate, and that they had conducted an unauthorized biofuel experiment, which resulted in an explosion.

Coulson asking FitzSimmons to join his team
Coulson was impressed with the scientists and invited them to join his team. Simmons was excited by the idea, but Fitz was initially afraid of going into the field. Simmons was able to convince him. Stationed on the Bus, the pair designed specialized equipment and compounds on the spot in various emergency situations.

The First Mission
Coulson revealing that he is alive
While Maria Hill was meeting with Grant Ward, Coulson entered, revealing that he was not dead as everyone believed. They discussed their first assignment together, which was to locate and assist Mike Peterson, a known enhanced individual. Later, Coulson spoke with Hill about his time in Tahiti, but said he was more than happy to be back on the job. Hill and Dr. J. Streiten were reluctant to release Coulson for active duty, given the horrific nature of his recovery. They were astonished to learn that Coulson didn't know the truth about his death and resurrection. Hill told Streiten that Coulson could never know the truth.

Coulson recruiting Melinda May
Coulson went to visit Melinda May, whom he had worked with in the past. He asked her if she would join his team, promising that he would be picking the ops and making the calls. May was still haunted by her last mission with Coulson in Bahrain. She was reluctant to return to combat. Coulson told her that he only needed her to "drive the Bus."

Coulson arriving onto the Bus
Coulson arrived on the Bus in his car, Lola. As he and Ward explored the plane, Coulson disclosed that the Bus used to be standard issue for new teams until the Helicarriers were created. May appeared and said they had located one of the Rising Tide's most prolific hackers. Ward was more interested in the fact that May was part of the team, due to her legendary status as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson stressed that she was merely the pilot and was not there for combat missions.

Meeting Skye
Coulson and Grant Ward arresting Skye
During the new team's first mission, they encountered the Rising Tide "hacktivist" known as Skye. She had posted a video of Michael Peterson, the man S.H.I.E.L.D. was searching for, so they wanted her for questioning. Coulson and Grant Ward tracked Skye to her van, where they found her making a video about S.H.I.E.L.D. not being able to stop the Rising Tide. Coulson arrested her and brought her to the Bus.

Coulson interrogates Skye
Coulson and Ward Interrogated Skye. Coulson apologized for Ward's hostility, saying Ward had history with the Rising Tide. Coulson asked Skye where Peterson was and she claimed she didn't know anything. Then Coulson discover that Skye was on the scene when Peterson saved Debbie. During the interrogation, Coulson learned of Peterson's connection to the Centipede Project. To gain Skye's trust, Coulson pretended to give Ward a truth serum and Ward told Skye some low-level intel about S.H.I.E.L.D.'s activities. In return, Skye told Ward what little she knew about the Centipede project.

Coulson learns what caused the explosion
Using the information given by Skye, Leo Fitz, with the aid of the Echo Chamber, was able to recreate the CCTV footage of the explosion within the Centipede Project lab and determine its cause. Coulson confirmed that the explosion was the result of a man having been submitted to the unstable Extremis process. The video showed the exploding man had a Centipede Device locked onto his arm. By examining a damaged Centipede Device retrieved from the lab, Jemma Simmons learned that the Centipede Serum was very similar to the Super Soldier Serum developed by Abraham Erskine during World War II. The team began working on a plan to subdue Peterson, before he too exploded.

Chase of Michael Peterson
Coulson finding Mike Peterson
Michael Peterson kidnapped Skye and assaulted Melinda May. Skye managed to hack into the Bus's computers and alert the team to her and Peterson's location. Coulson and Grant Ward arrived at Union Station and Coulson tried to convince Peterson to surrender. Peterson punched the door off of Skye's Van and tried to escape with Skye and Ace Peterson into the building.

Coulson trying to stop Mike Peterson
Coulson entered the building, trying to find Peterson to calm him down before he exploded and killed Skye and other civilians. Coulson was able to find Ace, who had been separated from his father. Coulson handed Ace to a police officer to take outside, and promised Ace that he would save his father. Coulson welcomed May as a third party arrived to try to kill Peterson. Coulson ordered Ward to the second floor of the building and take aim at Peterson, while he stayed on the first floor to make sure Peterson didn't escape. Coulson insisted that Ward only fire if he had to, and Ward reluctantly agreed.

Coulson confronting Mike Peterson
Coulson caught up to Peterson and tried to talk him down. Coulson placed his gun down on the ground as a show of peace, but Peterson noticed Ward was upstairs aiming a rifle at him. Coulson said he knew that the Centipede Serum was poisoning Mike's body, reminding him that the man at the Centipede lab had gotten worked up and exploded. Peterson insisted he was not like that man. Peterson claimed that organizations like S.H.I.E.L.D. were responsible for him losing his wife and job, angrily saying that the government was waiting to make an example of anyone who stood up against them, like he himself was doing. Coulson said that Peterson was a good man and that he could still become a true hero. Coulson promised to help him. Ward suddenly shot Peterson with the Night-Night Gun.

Recruiting Skye
Coulson waiting for Skye
After stopping Mike Peterson and getting him the help he needed, Coulson accompanied Skye to take Ace Peterson to stay with his aunt. As they left, Coulson asked Skye if she had thought about joining the team. Skye was undecided, so Coulson assured her that they could do some good. After getting a call from Grant Ward about an 0-8-4, Coulson and Skye flew back to the Bus in Lola.

Finding an 0-8-4
Coulson meeting with Grant Ward and Melinda May
Back on the Bus, Coulson was confronted by Grant Ward. Ward complained that Skye was not a trained S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and didn't belong on the team. Coulson argued that it was because Skye didn't think like an agent that they needed her. He pointed out that S.H.I.E.L.D. employed civilian consultants all the time, using Tony Stark as an example. Ward then informed Coulson that they have been called to Peru to investigate an 0-8-4, an unidentified object, at an archaeological site called Llactapata.

Coulson arriving in Peru
When Coulson and his team arrived on site in Peru, Skye volunteered to warn the local residents of the potential danger. Coulson, not wanting to start a panic, explained that he wanted to keep the investigation contained. He told Skye that she was only there to create a diversion if word did get out. The team was then led to the temple by an archaeologist, who showed them to the 0-8-4.

Coulson reunites with Camilla Reyes
Once inside the temple, Coulson was contacted by Ward, after he and May had had a confrontation with a group of soldiers. Coulson went out to see what was happening and soon spotted the commanding officer. He recognized her as Camilla Reyes, with whom he had worked years earlier. Reyes wanted to claim the 0-8-4 for Peru. Coulson contended that an 0-8-4 superseded all national claims. The two began reminiscing, when a group of rebels attacked. Coulson's Team and Reyes' soldiers were forced to retreat to the Bus.

Hijacking and Retaking of the Bus
Coulson interrupting his team
Ward was able to pry the 0-8-4 out of the wall of the temple before retreating. When everyone had boarded the Bus, Coulson gave orders to set a course for a nearby S.H.I.E.L.D. base to carry out a contingency protocol to contain and neutralize the artifact. Coulson approached May, saying he knew she had not wanted to see combat and he was sorry, but she remained silent. Coulson interrupted Ward, Simmons and Fitz, who were arguing over the artifact. He said that they all had special talents and ordered them to work it out. Coulson then gave Reyes a tour of the Bus.

Coulson sees Camilla Reyes' ruse
In his office, Coulson showed Reyes some of his collectibles. She tried to seduce him, but Coulson recognized it as a ruse and knew Reyes and her men were trying to hijack the plane. Coulson told her that Grant Ward should already know that her men would need to eliminate Melinda May from the controls to be successful. Coulson tried to reach May, but was forced to surrender after learning his team was being held hostage. He gave control of the plane to Reyes.

Coulson captured by Camilla Reyes
Coulson was tempted to let Reyes kill him rather than give her information on the plane's destination, but Reyes threatened to kill his entire team by dumping them from the cargo bay where they were imprisoned. Coulson learned that the 0-8-4 had been made shortly after World War II by a group of former HYDRA scientists, commissioned by the Peruvian government to use against the rebels. It had been lost during a battle because of its temporal instability, which caused it to vanish and reappear within the stone that the temple had been built around.

Coulson saving Camilla Reyes
Coulson had loosened his bonds, when he saw one of Fitz's drones flying through the cabin. He guessed what was about to happen and used his ropes to tie himself to a post. Fitz caused the 0-8-4 to discharge, blasting a hole in the side of the plane, causing all of the interior doors on the plane to open. Coulson, Reyes, and several soldiers were sucked towards the hole. Coulson managed to pull himself out of harm's way, taking Reyes with him.

Meeting with Nick Fury
Coulson congratulates his team's success
The Bus arrived at the Slingshot facility in the desert, where the 0-8-4 was to be launched into the sun. Skye asked Coulson why they had gone to the trouble of acquiring the object, if they were just going to destroy it. Coulson explained that the 0-8-4 was too dangerous for any one country or organization to possess.

Coulson having his meeting with Nick Fury
Following his mission in Peru, Coulson went and met with Nick Fury, who was angry at Coulson because of the damage done to the Bus. Fury also warned Coulson that Skye might still be loyal to the Rising Tide. He then ordered Coulson not to let Simmons and Fitz install their fish tank on the plane.

Infiltration into Ian Quinn's Mansion
Coulson learning about Franklin Hall kidnapping
The team received a call that a S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist named Dr. Franklin Hall had been kidnapped in an incident involving an invisible substance picking up and throwing down trucks. The team investigated and Fitz and Simmons learned that an element called Gravitonium, which could change the effects of gravity, had been used.

Coulson learning that Ian Quinn was responsible
Coulson and Ward tracked down the supplier of the vehicles and equipment used in the attack, leading them to Todd Chesterfield who had been paid in gold. When they learned where the gold had originated, they discovered that Hall was being kept by Ian Quinn.

Coulson is shown the Gravitonium by Franklin Hall
Skye successfully infiltrated Quinn's Mansion and, Coulson and Ward were able to break into the compound. Coulson located Dr. Hall and tried to convince him to leave, but Hall claimed that the Gravitonium was too dangerous to be in the hands of S.H.I.E.L.D. or Quinn. Coulson learned Hall's plan was to sink the complex thereby destroying the Gravitonium and Quinn. Coulson realized that if Hall succeeded, thousands of people would be killed, so he shot the glass beneath them, causing Hall to fall into the Gravitonium, which appeared to absorb him.

Coulson discussing field work with Melinda May
Back on the Bus, Coulson instructed agent Tyler to put the Gravitonium in the Fridge, a S.H.I.E.L.D. detainment and storage facility, and claimed he wanted nobody to know about its existence, honoring Hall's wishes. After ending the call, Coulson tried to remember how to load a gun. Melinda May entered his office saying that she didn't enjoy these close encounters, which Coulson understood to mean that she was still uncomfortable about field work, but she corrected him, saying that she was ready to return to the field. Coulson questioned whether she meant combat or watching his back. May replied that it meant the same thing.

Searching for Akela Amador
Coulson assigning Skye a task
Coulson went to see Skye in a S.H.I.E.L.D. SUV. He discussed several types of heists, telling Skye he needed her to figure out how someone had been exploiting security systems in a string of recent jewel thefts.

Coulson discussing his old protégé
Coulson, Melinda May and Skye went to investigate a robbery on a train, where a group of military officers escorting some diamonds were taken down by a lone woman with her eyes closed. They learned from Skye through social media that the assailant was Akela Amador, who was Coulson's old protégé. Coulson told how Amador was a former agent who had supposedly gone rogue after a bad mission. Coulson decided to hold off on informing HQ so that he could investigate for himself.

Coulson and Grant Ward search for Akela Amador
Coulson and Grant Ward retraced her steps and tried to locate her, arriving in Zloda, Belarus. They spoke to an Innkeeper who claimed that Amador was an angel because she had correctly sensed the woman had a tumor, which made Amador's abilities more of a mystery. While they were continuing their investigation, Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons traced a video signal that seemed to show Amador's point of view. They quickly realized that Amador was looking at them. Fitz, Simmons, and Skye were in a van that was attacked by Amador, who drove into the van's side, knocking it over.

Coulson arguing Melinda May about Akela Amador
Coulson and his team were fine, but the attack solidified Amador's position as an enemy. Skye was able to decrypt the broadcast and the team discovered that the source of the video was coming from Amador's own right eye, which was a prosthetic. Watching the video feed from her eye, they learned that Amador was being controlled by an unknown person. Coulson remained adamant that the team needed to help her on their own without reporting to HQ. Coulson realized that they could determine Amador's position if they continued to monitor the video feed from her eye.

Coulson questioning Akela Amador
Coulson found out that May was attempting to bring Amador to HQ.  May and Amador began fighting. Coulson arrived before Amador could kill May and sedated Amador with the Night-Night Gun. Coulson waited for Amador to wake up, then revealed to her that his team had rerouted her eye's signal to a pair of glasses being worn by Ward as he carried out the operator's directives with Skye, giving the rest of the team time to disable the failsafe. Knowing she was safe, Amador was able to reconcile with Coulson, her former mentor, explaining to him that if she had followed orders, she wouldn't have been in that situation.

Coulson saying goodbye to Akela Amador
Coulson with May's assistance, tracked down Amador's operator, named the Englishman, only to discover that he too was being controlled by a third party when a kill switch in a similar eye implant killed him. With the case resolved for now, Coulson discussed the loose ends with Amador before saying his goodbyes and handing her over to S.H.I.E.L.D. authorities. He promised her a fair trial, but Amador was simply happy to finally be free of the eye implant's control. As she left, Amador asked May what had happened to Coulson, noting a difference in him. May recounted how he had almost died before the Battle of New York, but Amador said that something had been done to him, before dropping the subject, leaving May confused. Later, Coulson joined Skye in the SUV and talked about the recent mission.

Skye's Secret
Coulson and his team meeting with Quan Chen
Coulson introduced his team to Quan Chen, leader of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Hong Kong district who told them that meta-human Chan Ho Yin had been kidnapped. Skye, surprised to find out there were other people with powers, was told by Coulson that Chan was on the Index, a short list of people with incredible abilities kept by S.H.I.E.L.D.

Coulson learns of Skye's betrayal
Skye claimed that she was innocent, noting that she has been on the Bus with the team for the last two weeks, but Coulson claimed this would have given her the perfect opportunity to hack S.H.I.E.L.D. Backed by Grant Ward, Skye set out to prove her innocence by helping them find the hacker who sent the leak. In Texas, the team attempted to capture Miles Lydon, an experienced Rising Tide hacker, but he managed to escape them.

Coulson is attacked by Miles Lydon
Coulson, Melinda May and Quan, along with other agents, infiltrated the lab. Ward released Skye when Coulson told them they needed her help to hack the facility's system. After the agents freed Chan, he quickly killed Quan, claiming that no matter who he went with he would never be able to use his gift. Chan began to attack the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents present, despite his powers causing him pain and burning his skin. Coulson and May injected Chan with an extremely high dose of the Centipede serum, causing Chan's body to overheat and explode. However, with Lydon's help they managed to transfer the energy from the explosion out of the building and into the sky, saving the civilians. Coulson thanked Lydon before kicking him off the plane.

Coulson confronts Skye
Coulson then turned his attention to Skye and claimed that ever since she got on the plane she had been hiding something. He ordered her to confess or he would be done with her. Skye revealed a chip that had all of the existing information on her parents, from which she only found a single file docketed by S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson decided to let her stay, but in return she would have to wear a Tracking Bracelet that let S.H.I.E.L.D. track her every move, and limited her ability to interact with electronic devices without permission.

Chitauri Virus
Coulson undergoing medical tests
Coulson underwent several medical tests which Simmons questioned, saying that he was not due for a physical for another three months. Coulson said he got a call from his physical therapist and had told her that he had been feeling "rusty".

Coulson examining Adam Cross' corpse
Coulson and his team headed to the campsite. The team investigated the earlier incident as Fitz and Simmons discovered mysterious electrostatic anomalies and examined a hole in Cross's head. As Simmons went closer to examine Cross's corpse, static discharged from his body before it fell to the ground. On the Bus, Skye researched Cross but claimed that he was clean of any criminal record. Ward said that everyone looks clean on their first "go around". Coulson told Ward he was being too hard on Skye but Ward said that if she wanted their trust back she had to earn it. Coulson defended Skye saying that what she had just done was a good start. Coulson came down to the lab with Simmons who analyzed the victim's body while Fitz stayed out of the lab, expressing a general apprehension and disgust for being around dead things. Simmons showed Coulson the brain of the victim which had been struck by 2,000 megajoules of electricity.

Coulson discovers another victim
Coulson, May, and Ward quickly drove to the new location with Skye, pinpointing the event to a farmhouse not far away. Coulson told Skye to do a background check on the owner of the farm. The energy signature suddenly disappeared and Ward, May, and Coulson arrived too late to save the owner, Frank Whalen. Coulson, Ward, and May traveled to the local firehouse where Tony Diaz exhibited strange behavior before retreating to the kitchen. Diaz claimed to hear a noise similar to the one heard by Cross earlier. Coulson said that he heard nothing, before noticing a pan lifting in the air. Alarmed, Coulson held Diaz at gunpoint. May contacted Coulson, reporting her discovery of a Chitauri Helmet.

Melinda May and Coulson watch as the pulse is released
Coulson asked how they got it, and Diaz said it was a souvenir from their clean up work in New York. He claimed that he, Cross, and Whalen were only cleaning it, leading Simmons to realize that Diaz was infected and that the helmet must have had an alien virus on it. Diaz, realizing he was going to end up like his friends, slowly became erratic and frightened. Coulson told Ward and May to evacuate everyone from the building. Coulson stayed, and comforted Diaz during his last moments, sharing his experience from his own brief death, before leaving Diaz to his fate.

Coulson makes a promise to Jemma Simmons
Coulson returned to the Bus and told Simmons to begin developing a cure. Simmons told Coulson that the infection was spread through electrostatic energy, as a shock. In the middle of her explanation, a lab tool hovered ominously behind Simmons. Coulson apologized sincerely, and locked her in the lab, as he realized Simmons was infected. Coulson reassured his team that Simmons would find a way to cure herself. Coulson contacted Felix Blake to find out more about the virus. Blake told them they had no record of the virus, but in order to save the rest of the team, they must put their infected agent down. Coulson tried to buy time to avoid this protocol by hanging up on Blake.

Coulson meeting with Felix Blake
Coulson revealed to May that he ordered the physical exam for himself, because of his own doubts. She told him to unbutton his shirt, which revealed the scar left behind by Loki, and she told him that he felt different because he was different. Coulson met with Blake, and Blake warned him that if he kept pulling stunts like this, the "higher-ups" would take the team away from him. Coulson brushed the comment off, and told Blake he would like to see them try. Blake left, jovially noting the change in Coulson's disposition.

Returning to The Hub
Coulson rescuing Shaw
At an unknown location, a captured Coulson was escorted to a torture room to be interrogated. When the interrogator arrived Coulson informed him that his cover had been blown, revealing the interrogator to be S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Shaw. May and Ward arrived to take out the other men and free Coulson before making their way out of the facility. Together, the agents escaped what was revealed to be an underground base in Siberia, where they used a pair of sleds to escape back to the Bus.

Coulson, May, and Ward meeting Victoria Hand
Coulson informed the rest of the team, but noted that the data was clearance level 8 and beyond their priorities. However, Skye questioned this, alarmed at being shut out of the process so quickly and that the rest of the team wasn't privy to the same information as Coulson. Ward countered that every agent can't have the same information, claiming that it would make the entire organization vulnerable. At the Hub, Coulson was asked by Skye if she could research S.H.I.E.L.D.'s data for information about her parents. Coulson told her they had more important things to do, but that he would look into it for her. Jasper Sitwell greeted the group and told Coulson, May, and Ward to join him for the briefing, locking Skye out again as Leo Fitz and Simmons opted to check out the science labs. Coulson, May, and Ward were introduced to Victoria Hand, who informed them that the South Ossetian rebels had developed a weapon called the Overkill Device, which they planned to use to declare their independence from Russia and Georgia. Hand explained that the device was designed to create sonic vibrations that were powerful enough to trigger and disable enemy weapons from a great distance, a technology that posed a wide-sweeping threat.

Coulson meeting with Skye
Before Ward went on his mission, Coulson told him to take care of Fitz, who had next to no field experience. Coulson and Hand discussed his recovery, they noted that not all agents got sent to Tahiti, and Coulson once again strangely responded that it was a magical place. Coulson reassured Hand that Ward and Fitz would complete the mission. Coulson met up with Skye in the hallways of the Hub. She tried to get answers from Coulson, but he coldly told her to "trust the system". With no other way to get answers, Skye decided to come up with a plan for her and Simmons to get the information they need. Coulson found May alone aboard the Bus practicing Tai Chi. May remained silent as he confessed that he did not like hiding information from the team, but realized that he must trust the system.

Coulson confronts Victoria Hand
Coulson confronted Hand about hiding the fact that there was no extraction plan for his agents, claiming that as a level 8, he had a right to know their safety was ensured. Hand pointed out that Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton never had an extraction plan. Coulson retorted that they were aware of it going into the field. Hand simply told him to trust the system. Coulson rejoined the team and they set out to go help Ward and Fitz. Coulson told Skye that he found the file on her parents, and informed her that it was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who left her at the orphanage. Skye emotionally thanked him for the information. Coulson revealed to May in private that he only told her part of the truth and asked for May's help in the rest. Later, Coulson made a phone call to gain information about his mysterious recovery. The agent told him that he didn't have access to the file, despite his clearance level.

Berserker Staff
Coulson clean-up after the Battle of Greenwich
Coulson and his team were assigned as part of the S.H.I.E.L.D. clean-up crew after Thor's battle with Malekith and the Dark Elves. While they cleaned up Greenwich University, which was affected by the battle, Coulson explained to Skye about the origins of Asgardians.

Coulson talks to the Ranger
Coulson and his team went to investigate the death of Bjorn. Coulson talked to Neils as Simmons discovered that whatever was in the tree was not of earthly origin, and Fitz confirmed that the staff was Asgardian. Coulson tried to get more details from the Ranger when Skye called to say something was happening on the news. Violence had breaken out in the streets of Oslo, resulting in twenty injured civilians. The news revealed that the riot was started by the same couple who had written a startling message on the streets: WE ARE GODS.

Coulson inspects the Berserker Staff
Skye asked Coulson to call Thor for help. Coulson states that he did but Nick Fury told him that Thor had gone "off the grid". Coulson then tells them that when Mjølnir landed in New Mexico they consulted an expert on Norse Mythology, Elliot Randolph. Coulson went to meet with Randolph and he told them the story of an Asgardian warrior, part of an army campaign who fell in love with Earth and stayed behind, who possessed a weapon called the Berserker Staff which granted the user incredible strength but drove him into an uncontrollable rage.

Coulson and Grant Ward questioning Elliot Randolph
Coulson and his team headed to Baffin Island, Canada because Randolph told him to look for clues there. While there he checked in with Skye who doing research online. She had found numerous negative comments left by people regarding the battle in Greenwich. But she did hear chatter about going underground, meaning the Paganists were searching for the next piece of the Asgardian staff underground. Coulson and Fitz followed, only to find the empty-handed Randolph. Coulson took Randolph aboard the Bus for questioning. Coulson tried to get answers out of Randolph but he claimed he only wanted the staff to study it. Coulson explained that from his past experiences with Asgardians, cases like this were personal to him. He told Randolph to get comfortable.

Last Piece
Coulson talks to Grant Ward about his anger
Ward told Coulson that the Asgardian Staff seemed to be bringing up his worst memory. Coulson replied that the fact Ward was telling him that made him feel like he could trust him, and suggested that Ward let some of his rage out on Randolph. Ward entered the room and attempted to get answers from Randolph. When he did not cooperate, Ward tried to stab him but Randolph twisted and bent the knife, confirming Coulson's theory that Randolph was the Asgardian warrior who stayed behind.

Coulson knows Elliot Randolph is Asgardian
Coulson revealed to Randolph how he found out about his heritage, noting he was not the first Asgardian he had had in his custody and said that Asgardians do not panic when in captivity. Coulson also noted the professor's pen, saying he would not have been able to get it on his salary. Coulson also noticed how Randolph was not curious to learn how he had met other aliens. While the team was amazed by Randolph's presence, May locked the interrogation room on Coulson's orders.

Coulson and his team arriving at the monastery
The group arrived at the monastery, in time to see Nystrom stab Randolph with the staff. Ward reluctantly grabbed the staff and attacked Nystrom, whom he managed to defeat. Meanwhile, Simmons was having trouble stopping Randolph's bleeding since she was unfamiliar with his alien anatomy. Coulson stuck his hand into Randolph's wound and told them that since Asgardians heal faster, all they had to do was keep him alive long enough for his body to heal itself. Simmons told Coulson to look for his heart. Coulson found Randolph's heart and managed to save him by stopping the bleeding.

The Truth Revealed
Rescue of Hannah Hutchins
Coulson dreaming about Tahiti
Coulson was tempted to touch the staff to figure out his the details of resurrection, but Randolph convinced him against it. Later, Coulson woke up on a massage table and asked his masseuse if he fell asleep. She replied that it meant he was relaxed. He agreed and said that Tahiti was too good to be true. The masseuse said, "It's a magical place." At that, Coulson woke up in his bed from the nightmare.

Coulson trying to calm Hannah Hutchins down
Coulson and Skye discussed Hannah Hutchins who was the safety inspector at StatiCorp. People suspected her of having telekinetic abilities, as she appeared to be able to move objects with her mind. Skye asked Coulson about it, and he told her that telekinetic powers were unheard of on the Index. The team traveled to Batesville to conduct an index asset evaluation and intake. Civilians had crowded around Hutchins's house, demanding that she be arrested. Coulson's team and the police were unable to calm the citizens, prompting May to sedate Hutchins. On the Bus, Coulson asked May to go into the interrogation room with him, both for protection and to get Hutchins to trust them. Coulson and May entered the Cage and Hutchins awoke and started backing up against the wall, scared. Coulson tried to appear friendly, and gave her a bottle of water and introduced himself and May. Coulson's gentle interrogation of Hutchins pulled up more information about the Staticorp accident.

Coulson and May helping Hannah Hutchins
Apparently, Hutchins had been receiving complaints for weeks about the coupling assembly coming loose at the bolts. Tobias Ford had been the technician there. Hutchins had gone down every few days to check the bolts and found no more issues. Coulson informed her that they believed she may have acquired some sort of telekinetic ability as a result of the accident. Hutchins broke down as she realized they thought it was her who had caused the freak accidents. Coulson explained that all of the incidents had one thing in common: her. Hutchins insisted that they were not her doing, and Coulson asked who she believed was causing it. After hesitation, she admitted to believing demons were haunting her because God did not protect her anymore.

Coulson and the team discuss Hannah Hutchins
Coulson and his team discussed Hutchins. Skye insisted that Hutchins was "overly nice"; she took the job as safety manager because she actually cared about people's lives, and she volunteered at a shelter and rescued puppies. Skye pointed out that person like Hutchins, who had lots of empathy would be completely devastated by the loss of life. Hutchins blamed herself. Skye begged Coulson to let her talk to Hutchins as a friend, but Coulson denied her request, saying it was too dangerous. In his office, Coulson set Skye straight about May's past. It was not an assault or a rescue. It was an index asset evaluation and intake that "went south."

Coulson arrives at the barn
A civilian girl and some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were being held captive by the followers of the gifted individual. May had gone in to retrieve them and took it upon herself to cross off the enemy force. Coulson said that May was never the same after that incident. He said she had once been warm and mischievous, much like Skye. Their talk was interrupted by Ford, who locked Skye and Coulson in the office. Coulson constructed a makeshift bomb out of his collectible Walkie-Talkie Wristwatch, though it pained him to destroy it. Later, Coulson praised Skye on her ability to read people and learn how their minds work. He said that was why he wanted her to pay close attention to this mission because he knew that one day she would be very good at it. Later, Coulson, Skye, Ward, and Simmons played "Upwords" in the lounge. Fitz walked into the lounge with shaving cream covering his face and hand. The team burst out laughing.

Recruiting Mike Peterson
Coulson greeting Mike Peterson to his team
Coulson recruited Mike Peterson to his team as super-soldier support. Soon, soldiers working for the Centipede Project sprang Edison Po from prison after perfecting the Centipede serum. Coulson's Team traced a Centipede-powered soldier, Brian Hayward, to an abandoned factory and walked into an ambush by a squad of Centipede-powered soldiers. When Po and Raina saw that Peterson still had his powers despite not having had an injection in quite some time, they realized he was the key to Stage 3 of their plan.

Coulson and Grant Ward talk while in Lola
Coulson's team discovered that the soldiers had been subjected to the same eye procedure that Akela Amador had underwent. Po told Raina that he informed the Clairvoyant about her. Raina asked who the Clairvoyant was and Po replied that the last person who tried to learn the identity of the Clairvoyant had received a knife in the eye. Coulson and Ward went on a mission to investigate Brian Hayward, one of the Centipede Soldiers who was identified on the CCTV footage. As they drove to the location of Hayward's sister, Ward managed to get Coulson to open up about his previous relationship, which included dinners at the Richmond. When they met the sister of Hayward, Ward approached her telling her Heyward had won the lottery and needed to contact them. They traced her call when she called her brother to tell him what had happened, giving them the current location of Centipede.

Kidnapped by Centipede Project
Mike Peterson tried to contact his son, Ace Peterson, and learned that he has been kidnapped by Project Centipede. Peterson appeared to offer himself in exchange for his son's release. Coulson escorted Peterson to the exchange where Peterson revealed that Centipede actually wanted Coulson in exchange for Ace, not himself, but he hesitated go through with the betrayal.

Coulson and Mike Peterson negotiate with Raina
They Arrived at the bridge to make the exchange. Coulson told Peterson to follow his instructions and requested to go with him so that he could be taken instead of Peterson. Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons also gave Peterson a Tracking Scent on his hand which would not be picked up by machines, as Peterson had insisted they do nothing that would endanger his son. At the meeting point, Peterson and Coulson spoke to Raina, who had arrived alongside her Centipede Soldiers for protection. She commented on how adorable his son was. With Coulson's Team standing back ready, it was  revealed that the exchange was for Coulson and not Peterson.

When the exchange started, Peterson attempted to break off the deal by threatening Raina's own life. She assured him that her employer did not care if she lived or died, and that if she was killed, his son would die a horrific death as a direct result. With Ward unable to assist them from his vantage point, Coulson told Peterson it was okay, understanding that he had no other choice. Mortified by the decisions he had been forced to make, Peterson still insisted that he had offered himself and wondered how he could ever look his son in the eye following this day. Coulson reassured him that it would be okay.

When Coulson agreed to the transfer, Ace Peterson was finally freed from Centipede Project and ran back into his father's arms. With Ace in his arms, Peterson expressed his regret to Coulson once again. Coulson accepted that Peterson had made the only decision he could. Peterson then ran back to Coulson's Team to see to his son. He told Ace he loved him and left him with Skye, knowing he would feel safe with her. Peterson then set off to rescue Coulson and redeem himself.

Coulson with Raina
Coulson was initially tortured by Edison Po, who told him that the Clairvoyant couldn't glean the information they wanted because the Clairvoyant had been unable to sense Coulson since his resurrection. The Clairvoyant decided that Po's methods were ineffective and killed him, after which Raina took over Coulson's interrogation. She used a scanning device to compel him to remember aspects of his being brought back to life. Coulson experienced flashbacks in which a reluctant Dr. J. Streiten and others operated on him. During the flashbacks, Coulson's skull cap was removed and his brain was directly stimulated by a robotic apparatus, while Coulson begged to be allowed to die.

Coulson's team rescued him, after which he confronted Streiten, who told Coulson he had been dead for days, not minutes, and was resurrected at the orders of Nick Fury. Streiten reveals that after his revival, Coulson had lost the will to live, and that the doctors manipulated Coulson's brain to give him false memories and restore him to the man he was before.

Skye's Story
Melinda May and Coulson in Mexico City
While Skye and the rest of the team visited S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy of Science and Technology, Coulson and Melinda May traveled to Mexico City, Mexico, where they tracked down former S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Richard Lumley, who had been involved with Skye's case and fell off the grid soon after.

Lumley told Coulson the story of that long-ago op. Shortly after returning home, the other agents involved in the op began to be eliminated until only he and Linda Avery remained. Avery took steps to hide Skye in the foster care system. She made sure Skye would never be in one home for too long, before Avery was murdered herself.

Coulson, tired of secrets, revealed this to Skye. He feared that learning of all of the lives lost on her behalf would shatter her spirit, however, Skye's resilience surprised him. She was grateful that S.H.I.E.L.D. had protected her all of these years and considered them to be the family that she never had.

The Mysterious Weapon
Coulson and his teammates.
Upon learning of Ian Quinn's ties to the Clairvoyant, Coulson focused his team's efforts on finding and apprehending Quinn. After the mission at S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy of Science and Technology, the team was informed by John Garrett about some mysterious weapon in Jamaica. The team went to the town of Negril and found the weapon. After some skirmish with the guards they managed to get the weapon onboard the Bus and fly off. Once they examined the weapon, Skye was able to hack the weapon's code and track its origin to the remote town of Limoux, France. During the flight to France, Coulson had a video conversation with Garrett about the weapon and Garrett's former protege, Agent Ward.

Tracking the Clairvoyant
Cybertek
THe team found records of Quinn making a ten-million dollar purchase from Cybertek. Coulson believed that Cybertek would deliver the purchase to Quinn personally, so his team went undercover.

Coulson made arrangements with the Italian authorities to allow S.H.I.E.L.D. to take over the investigations on Cybertek. He placed his team on the train on which Cybertek security chief, Carlo Mancini, was traveling to make the delivery to Quinn.

Coulson tracking Cybertek in Italy.
Unfortunately, Coulson and his team were betrayed by local officer Luca Russo, who was working with Cybertek, and was being paid large amounts of money to ensure that Cybertek's deliveries went unhindered. Coulson, and Agents Grant Ward and Melinda May, were separated from the train, leaving only Agents Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons and Skye to track the delivery.

Coulson managed to track down his team, Cybertek and Quinn to a mansion on the Italian countryside. He arrived too late prevent  the delivery of Quinn's purchase from Cybertek, a prosthetic leg. The leg had been made for captured former S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee, Michael Peterson, in the Clairvoyant's efforts to transform Peterson into the cybernetic assassin called "Deathlok". Coulson was also too late to prevent Quinn from shooting Skye twice in the stomach at the behest of the Clairvoyant.

After taking Quinn into custody, Coulson found the wounded Skye and called for Simmons. Simmons managed to temporarily prevent Skye from dying by placing her into a Hyperbaric Chamber, which lowered her core body temperature for the two-hour transport to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Trauma Zentrum in Switzerland.

The Guest House
Coulson and his team has an update on Skye's condition
Coulson tried to contact Nick Fury for answers. Dr. Jazuat told the team that Skye could only remain alive on life support. In grief, Coulson and his team returned to the Bus. Enraged, May began to beat Quinn senseless until Coulson ordered her out. Coulson decided that they would look for a way to save Skye's life, like the doctors had for him. Coulson explained to Ward, Fitz, and Simmons what actually happened in "Tahiti".

Coulson greeted John Garrett, Ward's former S.O, as he boarded the Bus and asked for Quinn. Coulson explained to him the situation and convinced him to help them save Skye, but not before a fight broke out between Ward and Garrett's new trainee, Agent Antoine Triplett. Coulson and Garrett stopped the fight, explaining that Garrett convinced HQ to let him interrogate Quinn. Coulson and Garrett entered the box with Quinn, who explained that he wasn't feeling very cooperative. Garrett grabbed Quinn's tongue as he was speaking, and threatened to tear it out. They began to question him regarding Project Deathlok. Quinn told them that the last person to ask about that program wound up with "two in the stomach", and Coulson almost punched him. Coulson asked if he shot Skye because she saw what they were delivering to him. Quinn responded that he did it because the Clairvoyant told him to.

Coulson argued that the Clairvoyant must have had something pretty deep on Quinn to make him shoot an unarmed girl. Quinn explained several occurrences with Garrett's Team as proof of The Clairvoyant's powers. He said that The Clairvoyant saw everything, except how Coulson returned. It was revealed that The Clairvoyant planned everything that happened so that Coulson would dig deeper into his own death and return in order to save Skye.

Coulson meets with Fitz before the mission
Coulson was told by May and Simmons that they were not sure they should dig deeper, partly because Fitz and Simmons didn't fully understand the file. Coulson insisted that they had to do everything possible, even if it meant giving the Clairvoyant what he wanted. May told Coulson that she agreed they should do whatever it took to save Skye.
