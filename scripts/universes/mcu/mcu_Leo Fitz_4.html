Fitz and Jemma Simmons were asked to study a mysterious box brought back from a field mission by Phil Coulson and Melinda May. Fitz, not believing that the box was as empty as it looked like, managed to reveal that it contained extremely advanced technology. Alphonso Mackenzie then came to the lab and told them that S.H.I.E.L.D. had heard about someone suffering from the same kind of dementia than the Chinese mobsters who had been in contact with the box.

Frederick locked Mackenzie in the reactor and threatened to kill him as well as Fitz by blowing up the facility. However, while Frederick was on the verge of killing Fitz, he was stopped by Robbie Reyes, who took his Ghost Rider form to eliminate Frederick. Reyes was followed by Johnson, who released Mack out of the reactor. Finally, Fitz managed to stop the reactor, preventing the whole facility from exploding.

Blackout Attack
Fitz discussing the Blackout Attack
When Miami was struck by a blackout, Fitz investigated the video sent by the so called "Inhuman Resistance" to determine its origin, seeing that the attack's high level of sophistication excluded the possibility of an opponent acting on his own.

Fitz, Alphonso Mackenzie and Phil Coulson were sent by Jeffrey Mace to Miami in order to solve the crisis. Aboard the Zephyr One, they watched the interview of Ellen Nadeer, and were informed that more American cities had also underwent a blackout.

However, since the E.M.P. was continuous and not pulsed, all of S.H.I.E.L.D. modern equipment was out of use when the team arrived in the E.M.P. area, forcing Fitz to track down the E.M.P.'s origin the old way. Fitz, Mackenzie and Coulson then arrived at the hotel where Yo-Yo Rodriguez was previously partying with her friends in order to save her from a Watchdogs attack.

Fitz pinpoints the location of the EMP in Miami
Fitz, Coulson, Mackenzie and Rodriguez quickly figured out that there was no such thing as the Inhuman Resistance and that all the blackout attacks were set up by the Watchdogs in order to grow hatred towards the Inhumans, since the Watchdogs wanted their extermination. Fitz then crafted hand-made compasses in order to locate the source of the E.M.P. Fitz, Coulson, Mackenzie and Rodriguez successfully raided the place where the E.M.P. source was located. Using Rodriguez's powers, they unarmed and knocked out all the Watchdogs before deactivating the E.M.P., ending the Miami blackout and giving the solve for other cities.

Fitz and Simmons were unable to locate the Quinjet but they soon learned a disturbing truth from Glenn Talbot: contrary to what had been announced, Jeffrey Mace is not an Inhuman. Instead, he was using a super strength serum inspired from Calvin Zabo's Formula. Fitz and Simmons strongly disagreed with this decision, stating that despite the precautions taken, the super-serum could be dangerous for Mace's health.

Fitz talking with Aida's head
Since they could not locate the Quinjet used by Mace, Fitz and Simmons suggested to use Aida's severed head in order to intimidate Yuri Zaikin, the Watchdog who had tried to kill Mace, to find their missing colleagues. The idea proved to be successful. Despite Simmons's disagreement, Fitz resolved to study Aida's head to find what had caused her rebellion. He downloaded her data on his phone and told Simmons that the head was locked in a S.H.I.E.L.D. vault.

Fitz is confronted by Simmons, who had been working on Aida's head all along instead of locking it away for good. Fitz was accused by Simmons, that of being the source of Ellen Nadeer's intel since he could have turned on Aida's eye camera and thus leaked intel from within S.H.I.E.L.D. However, Fitz rejected Simmons' accusations and corrected her when she told him he was obsessed with Aida.

Fitz arresting Holden Radcliffe
Instead, Fitz told her that he had been investigating on the cause of Aida's malfunction and that he had found the answer: Holden Radcliffe, Aida's creator. Following this revelation, Fitz joined a team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents led by Phil Coulson to Radcliffe Residence in order to arrest Radcliffe. Although, unknown to everyone present, it wasn't the real Radcliffe, but a Life-Model Decoy of him, as he anticipated himself being caught by S.H.I.E.L.D..

Fitz prepares to shoot Holden Radcliffe's LMD
Radcliffe was locked in a Containment Module at the Playground, where Fitz visited him. Fitz confronted Radcliffe about his betrayal and blaming him for having changed Aida's programming. When Radcliffe apologized to Fitz, he figured out that he is not talking to the real Holden Radcliffe, but rather to an Life-Model Decoy vision. Fitz would go to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, who was guarding the door, and asked for his gun. Fitz took the gun and shot Radcliffe, revealing that Radcliffe created an android of him, tricking all of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.

Fitz getting angry with the Holden Radcliffe's LMD
Since Radcliffe's LMD proved to be uncooperative, Fitz decided to hack into his systems to find the answers. However, the android's programming was incredibly complex and Fitz was unable to access it. The longer the questioning lasted, the more troubled Fitz was, especially when Radcliffe's LMD mentioned Fitz's father. Indeed, the android assumed that Holden Radcliffe and Alistair Fitz were classmates and that Radcliffe knew how few consideration Alistair had for his son. Fitz, enraged when reminded of his abusive father, disconnected the android and left the labs.

Fitz is comforted by Jemma Simmons
Back in his bedroom, where he stared at an old picture of his mother and him, Fitz was joined by Simmons. Fitz lamented over the fact that he had been betrayed on multiple occasions, be it by his father, Grant Ward or Radcliffe. However, his girlfriend made him see the bright side by reminding him that these betrayals had not kept him from becoming a good and caring person. When Fitz noticed that this could be the reason why he kept being betrayed, Simmons replied that it was the reason she fell in love with him. Finally, when Simmons told Fitz that his personality was something more than pure programming, it clicked in Fitz's mind: if he could not crack Radcliffe's LMD's code, it was because the android was not running on pure programming as well. Instead, he was using a Quantum Brain built by Aida thanks to the knowledge of the Darkhold.

S.H.I.E.L.D. destroy the Life-Model Decoys
While Fitz and Simmons examined his Quantum Brain, Radcliffe's LMD inadvertently revealed that Holden Radcliffe and Aida had crafted more than one Quantum Brain: the Melinda May that had been with them in the last few days was also a Life-Model Decoy. Fitz and Simmons thus informed Daisy Johnson, who was on the field with Melinda May's LMD, who was closer than ever to retrieve the Darkhold.

Fitz discover Tucker Shockley is an Inhuman
Fitz went back to the Zephyr One, where Shockley was brought following his capture by Johnson. After performing numerous analysis, he and Simmons figured out that the explosion had not been caused by a classical bomb but by an Inhuman who had underwent Terrigenesis: Shockley himself. Fitz, with the assistance of Mace and Simmons, managed to place Shockley in the Zephyr One's Containment Module and eject it out of the plane right before another deadly explosion, saving the lives of everyone on board.

Fitz sees Jeffrey Mace sacrifice himself
Fitz and Simmons understood the mechanism of Shockley's explosions and requested Johnson's help since her powers could be used to defuse Shockley's explosions.

Fitz and Simmons then explained to Phil Coulson, Quake and Alphonso Mackenzie that Aida and Holden Radcliffe had built another version of the Framework in which Melinda May was trapped. Mackenzie was very critical towards the Framework and voiced his critic to Fitz, reminding him that many of the ordeals S.H.I.E.L.D. had to overcome in the recent days was a more or less direct consequence of Fitz's designs.

When Skye voiced her concerns about the fact that The Doctor's machine was completely immoral, The Doctor dismissed her critics.

The Doctor talking with Melinda May
Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Melinda May, who informed him of the reporting of Jemma Simmons as a subversive by Phil Coulson.

The Doctor explained that they are looking for Jemma Simmons, and if it comes to it they agents must use lethal force.

The Doctor confronting Aida about Jemma Simmons
Feeling that Madame Hydra had been keeping information about Simmons, The Doctor infiltrated her office and found out that the alleged subversive was officially deceased. Madame Hydra then revealed to The Doctor that Simmons did not belong to their world and that she was here to destroy everything they had built inside the Framework. The Doctor learned that in this other world, S.H.I.E.L.D. had defeated HYDRA. Madame Hydra told her lover that she was a slave in this world and that she needed him to complete his Project Looking Glass so that she could defeat her enemies once and for all. When Madame Hydra left her office asking him to follow her, The Doctor stared once again at Simmons's picture, seemingly troubled.

Executing Agnes Kitsworth
The Doctor and Madame Hydra arrive at Ogygia
The Doctor would go with Madame Hydra to Ogygia, an island of the Framework designed as a residence for Holden Radcliffe and Agnes Kitsworth, since HYDRA had received an alert indicating the presence of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Though The Doctor could not find Grant Ward, Phil Coulson or Jemma Simmons, who where on the island, he found Kitsworth and could not help but notice her resemblance to Madame Hydra.

The Doctor listened to Radcliffe trying to explain that neither Kitsworth nor himself represented a threat for HYDRA. Disbelieving him, The Doctor would take a weapon from one of his HYDRA agents and threatened to shoot Kitsworth with it, telling Radcliffe that he had to convince him if he wanted his girlfriend to live. Unbeknownst to them, they were watched by Grant Ward, Jemma Simmons and Phil Coulson. Ward had a shot at The Doctor but Simmons refused that he killed him since it would also mean the death of the real-life Leo Fitz.

The Doctor killing Agnes Kitsworth
Radcliffe further explained the situation to The Doctor, trying to have Fitz remembering details of their past friendship in the real world. When The Doctor mentioned Simmons, Radcliffe mentioned how deeply she and Fitz were in love in the real world. However, all these attempts were done to no avail when The Doctor claimed that his work in HYDRA was his true nature and, to make his point, he murdered Kitsworth in cold blood right before Radcliffe's eyes. This cold-blood murder horrified Simmons, who witnessed the whole scene and screamed, and The Doctor stared at her, puzzled, while his agents exchanged bullets with Coulson and Ward. The Doctor then left Ogygia.

The Doctor prepares to torture Daisy Johnson
Back at the Triskelion, The Doctor visited a cell with Daisy Johnson inside, who had been captured by HYDRA after having been tricked to admit her allegiance to S.H.I.E.L.D..

The Doctor further interrogated Daisy Johnson in her cell, asking her to reveal the whereabouts of the Patriot and of Jemma Simmons. He also told her that he was aware of the existence of another world from which Johnson had come and that HYDRA considered that Johnson and Simmons had entered the Framework to conquer it. Johnson replied that she did not know where Mace and Simmons were but that she would gladly give him the location of Simmons if she knew it since she considered her to be the only person to make Fitz realize that his life in the Framework was an immense lie. Enraged, The Doctor violently slapped Johnson, calling the Framework his home.

The Doctor discussing killing Agnes Kitsworth
The Doctor reported the results of his unsuccessful interrogation to Madame Hydra, who decided to carry on the questioning while The Doctor had to deal with a security breach regarding the Project Looking Glass, due to S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Antoine Triplett having placed a camera in a HYDRA facility. The Doctor then walked and discussed with his father Alistair Fitz, expressing concerns about the necessity of killing Agnes Kitsworth.

The Doctor was devastated after Melinda May and Daisy Johnson’s escape during which Madame Hydra was severely injured. Alistair Fitz told him that he was now acting leader of HYDRA. As such, The Doctor summoned Sunil Bakshi to the Triskelion and ordered him to disclose the identity of the two rebels on his T.V. show. He was later informed by his father that HYDRA had received a tip regarding the location of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents responsible of his lover’s situation. When The Doctor decided to lead the chase himself, Madame Hydra woke up and ordered him to complete the Project Looking Glass as it was the only way of saving her, and thus let his father lead the operation.

The Doctor works on Project Looking Glass
However, the HYDRA mission failed to capture the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. The Doctor, enraged, yelled at his father for this failure, but was quickly chastised in return, with Alistair Fitz considering his reaction to be only worthy of his mother. The Doctor calmed down and admitted that he could not tolerate any weakness or failure, even from his father. He later went back to Madame Hydra's apartment and informed her that he had completed his Project Looking Glass, enabling her to get a new and stronger body. The Doctor also asked his lover to take him with her. Later, Alistair Fitz informed him that after interrogating Holden Radcliffe, he found out that the fallen scientist and Daisy Johnson had been communicating through the vent between their respective cells.

Leader of HYDRA
The Doctor interrogating Holden Radcliffe
The Doctor went to Holden Radcliffe's cell in order to determine what the he and Daisy Johnson discussed when they were both imprisoned in adjacent cells at the Triskelion. At first, Radcliffe refused to speak, telling that he was already dead in the real world and that living in such a horrible version of the Framework, without Agnes Kitsworth, meant nothing to him. However, The Doctor persuaded Radcliffe to change his opinion by telling him that his Project Looking Glass could enable the transhumanist scientist to achieve immortality. The Doctor thus learned of the existence of the backdoor and gathered a team of HYDRA agents to stop Jemma Simmons and Quake.

The Doctor discovers Alistair Fitz' dead body
However, while the Zephyr One was heading to the steel mill indicated by Radcliffe, The Doctor received a phone call from his father Alistair Fitz. Indeed, his father was threatened by Simmons who ordered him to bring Fitz, but instead he chose to ask his son to come and arrest Simmons. The Doctor heard his father being accidentally killed by Simmons and rushed at his house, only to find his dead body. Enraged, The Doctor had Radcliffe staring at the body of Alistair and swore to get revenge on Simmons.

The Doctor about to kill Jemma Simmons
Despite Madame Hydra ordering him to get back to the Triskelion, The Doctor took the Zephyr One and the HYDRA team to the steel mill where the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were. Accompanied by Radcliffe, The Doctor was able ti find the steel mill, to find found Simmons and to get vengeances for the death of his father. The Doctor ordered Simmons to kneel, but she won't trying to force him to draw out the man she knew and loved, The Doctor felts nothing but anger for Simmons, he would shoot her in the leg, forcing her to kneel, and prepared to kill her.

Fitz leaving the Framework
However, The Doctor was suddenly disarmed by Radcliffe, hitting him before he could murder Simmons. The Doctor is dragged by Radcliffe to the backdoor, as Radcliffe apologized for everything having regret for all the wrong he had done and what had happened to Fitz. The fallen scientist then threw The Doctor through the backdoor, thus successfully bring him back into the real world.

Escaping the Framework
Fitz discovers Aida's in her human form
Fitz woke up in Anton Ivanov's naval base, where Phil Coulson and Melinda May were already awake. However, when remembering that his actions had led to the deaths of Agnes Kitsworth and Jeffrey Mace, Fitz was horrified and started panicking, despite Coulson trying to calm him down. While Fitz was still in distress, Aida arrived, using her newly created human body. She smiled at Fitz and seemingly tried to seduce him like she did in the Framework. Fitz, puzzled, was unable to react and could not move away, keeping May from shooting Aida. Suddenly, Aida teleported, displaying an ability similar to the Inhuman Gordon and took Fitz away with her.

Back to the Real World
Fitz and Aida on a beach
Aida teleported Fitz and herself to a beach, where she experienced the pleasant sensations of the warm sand and the water on her feet. Fitz himself was not that well, torn between his real life and his memories of the Framework. He confronted Aida about manipulating him and causing pain. Aida said that she had only repaired his relationship with his father and confessed that she loved him. Afterwards, she teleported with him into an apartment. Though the apartment was made so that Fitz would find it familiar, Fitz was still highly troubled. Fitz asked Aida if she was able to feel empathy and made her realize that by carrying her plans, she had endangered the lives of the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents by enabling Anton Ivanov to kill them. Upon understanding that and by using her newly found compassion, Aida teleported back to the naval base and tried to stop Ivanov's multiple mechanical bodies who had taken over the base.

Fitz successfully rescues Alphonso Mackenzie
Aida successfully returned to the base with Fitz and saved Alphonso Mackenzie, who was still trapped in the Framework. They teleported on the Zephyr One, where Piper and Jemma Simmons used I.C.E.R.s on them and locked them into the plane's Containment Module. The whole team, finally reunited, headed to the destroyed Playground, where Fitz and Aida were placed in one of the remaining Containment Chamber, blocking Aida's teleporting abilities.

Fitz breaks up with Aida
Fitz finally woke up and discussed with Aida. He lamented over the fact that his friends would not forgive his past actions in the Framework. Still traumatized by his behavior as The Doctor, Fitz thought that he had an evil nature implanted by a father figure, just like his former colleague and friend Grant Ward, and feared that this would drive Simmons away from him, destroying all the future he had planned for their couple. Aida tried to comfort him but mistakenly thought that after what they had experienced in the Framework, Fitz was still in love with her in the real world. When she realized that Fitz was still deeply in love with Simmons and only her, which causes Aida to go completely insane.

Fitz grieving with Jemma Simmons
Aida tried to forcefully take Fitz out of the Playground to live with him, whether he wanted it or not. However, due to the Quantum Field Disruptors of the chamber, Aida could not escape. Fitz was pulled out of the chamber by James Davis, Piper and Prince. Fitz warned them that Aida would easily leave the Containment Chamber: indeed, she had built a body with numerous Inhuman abilities, including Lincoln Campbell's lightning manipulation. They were later caught by soldiers sent by Glenn Talbot and immediately after, Aida attacked them. Prince was killed but Piper managed to bring Fitz to the Zephyr One, where he ordered May to take off the plane, as they were no more than easy targets for Aida. Talbot agreed to let the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents leave and they finally escaped the ruins of the Playground. Fitz would remain in the plane's Containment Module, grieving about what has happened. He was joined by Simmons who, after hesitating, sat beside him and hugged him in comfort. Both of them burst into tears, traumatized but finally reunited.

Regrets and Guilt
Fitz is questioned about Aida
Since S.H.I.E.L.D. was heavily vulnerable to Aida's assaults, Fitz and Jemma Simmons tried to figure out a way to stop her. Fitz told Simmons about the Inhumans he had been studying in the Framework, assessing their powers through painful and even lethal procedures, which included Lincoln Campbell, Vijay Nadeer and Gordon.

Fitz is asked if he wants Aida dead
Fitz lamented over the fact that he was unable to find an efficient solution to stop Aida and that his ideas had only brought pain and death so far. Simmons replied that this was the kind of idea they needed because Aida had to be killed, though Fitz did not seem enchanted by this perspective. The S.H.I.E.L.D. agents soon had to deal with another part of Aida's plans. Indeed, Aida was shutting down the Framework, deleting all the elements in it and thus threatening the lives of Alphonso Mackenzie and Elena Rodriguez who were still trapped in it. Fitz and Daisy Johnson managed to find a way to postpone their deletion, but it would only last a few hours.

Fitz and Jemma Simmons working together again
When S.H.I.E.L.D. finally retrieved the Darkhold from Aida with assistance of Ghost Rider, Phil Coulson devised a plan to lure Aida and stop her. In order to complete this plan, he asked Fitz and Simmons to put aside their emotional troubles about what had happened in the Framework in order to work together. Fitz and Simmons silently nodded, ready to work together. Fitz returned at the Playground with the others and he and Simmons were quickly confronted by Aida, who seized Simmons and threatened to kill her.

Fitz asking Aida not to kill Jemma Simmons
Fitz, distressed, agreed to help Aida retrieve the Darkhold and come with her, but Aida stabbed Simmons nonetheless much to Fitz's horror. However, unbeknownst to Aida, Simmons had been replaced by a Life-Model Decoy in order to lure Aida into a trap, and Fitz, though visibly shaken, had only fooled Aida by making her believe he would obey her. Fitz then rushed at the real Simmons and the two of them watched as Coulson, temporarily using the powers of the Spirit of Vengeance, destroyed Aida's body while she was staring at Fitz in despair.

Fitz and Jemma Simmons witness Aida's death
With Aida gone, Fitz attended Robbie Reyes' return to Hell. After that, the agents were warned by Mackenzie and Rodriguez, who had escaped the Framework, that soldiers were coming for them. Fitz offered to stay behind and turn over himself in order to make amends for his mistakes, but Simmons and the others made him understand that they had forgiven him and that they had to stay together. However, his friends refused, with Daisy explaining that she had tried to do something similar after Lincoln Campbell's sacrifice, only for her to lose herself and realize she needed her friends.

Uncovering the Future
Arrest and Escape
Fitz is alone in Rae's Restaurant
Under Coulson's suggestion, they all then decided to go to Rae's Restaurant and enjoy a meal together before potentially being arrested. As they sat in the diner, Fitz was not eating still feeling guilty. Suddenly the lights shut off and a mysterious man leading an armed squad entered to take them. The man used a Stasis Device to stun them and bring everyone but Fitz through the Time Di'Alla, which liquified and transported them to the year 2091.

Fitz trying to find his friends
Fitz had little time to cope with the fact that his friends had gone missing as the United States Air Force troops, led by Evans and Lucas, came to arrest him and took him to the Blue Raven Ridge facility. There, Fitz was interrogated because he was suspected of having helped the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to escape. Fitz denied all the accusations but acknowledged that he was responsible for the death of Jeffrey Mace. He then offered to fully cooperate in order to locate the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, being provided books to elaborate on multiple theories. However, over the course of six months, none of them proved to be relevant and General Hale grew weary of Fitz's failed attempts.

Fitz and Lance Hunter attempt their escape
While looking for his friends, Fitz had also tried to reach Lance Hunter through fan letters sent to a football magazine. Hunter eventually got Fitz's message and came to him at the facility. After an emotional reunion, Hunter helped Fitz escape the military and both started looking for their missing friends. Fitz accessed the security camera footage and identified the vehicle used by Enoch and his squad when they arrested the team. After tracking down the vehicle, Fitz and Hunter discovered where Enoch was living.
