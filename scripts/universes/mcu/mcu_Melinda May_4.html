<html><p>Although Piper thought that there would be no gunfire and bloodshed, the feminine figure ordered her robots to kill the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. They were stopped from doing so by Yo-Yo Rodriguez, who stole their machine guns, enabling May to engage in hand-in-hand combat with the androids. Although May and her friends were able to take down several enemies, they were forced to retreat when the androids' leader sliced off Rodriguez's arms with her Chakram. May and the other managed to reach the Zephyr One and promptly left St. Louis. Arriving near the Lighthouse, May contacted Daisy Johnson, who had remained in the Lighthouse, and urged her to open the aircraft access as quickly as possible.

Phil Coulson's Fate
May learns about the Fear Dimension
May and Phil Coulson went to see Leo Fitz, who had been wounded in the explosion of the Kree Orb planned by General Hale. Fitz explained to them that the explosion had caused a tear in space-time which generated seemingly impossible phenomena like a subterranean forest. When Daisy Johnson and Deke Shaw joined them after being attacked by a Kree Warrior, Fitz hypothesized that the rift generated recreations of the team's fears, which was confirmed when he displayed footage of Lash, much to May's shock. Fitz explained that he had a plan to close the Fear Dimension, but that someone had to risk his life for it.

Coulson agreed to be the one to carry out the mission, which May heavily disapproved, suggesting to go down herself as the team's specialist. The situation escalated in an argument between Johnson and Coulson about the future of S.H.I.E.L.D., but Coulson eventually fainted on the ground. May and the others waited for Jemma Simmons to complete medical exams and for Coulson to regain consciousness. Simmons explained that there was necrotic tissue expanding in Coulson's body, meaning that Coulson was dying, and May related it to Ghost Rider and the deal Coulson had made with the Spirit of Vengeance to defeat Aida. Coulson confirmed that the demonic possession had cancelled the effects of the GH.325.

May and Phil Coulson discuss his fate
As the team tried to process the sad news, Johnson blamed Coulson for not having disclosed his condition earlier so that they could have found a way to save him and angrily left. Before Coulson left to follow her, May told him that he had managed things the wrong way and that he should have told his team about the deal he had struck. Later, May and Coulson had a conversation about his fate, with Coulson explaining that he had accepted the idea of dying after having been given a second chance so that a new leader, Johnson, could emerge. May then told Coulson that the team would not give up on him so easily, to which Coulson replied that he did not intend to die while performing his mission.

Back in the Lighthouse's control room, May joined the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to monitor Coulson's progression down to the rift of the Fear Dimension. Although they eventually lost contact, May remained confident that Coulson could accomplish his task. While they waited, they received an alert indicating that an aircraft was incoming, and they recognized it as being a Quinjet. May and Johnson went outside to check it and it turned out to be S.H.I.E.L.D. reinforcements gathered by Shaw and led by Deathlok, who went down and successfully helped Coulson to shut down the Fear Dimension.

May at Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons' wedding
With the mission accomplished, May joined her friends in the subterranean forest where they celebrated the wedding of Fitz and Simmons.

Hunt for a Ship
May listened to Daisy Johnson's explanations regarding her investigations on Cybertek, as S.H.I.E.L.D. was looking for Gravitonium in order to seal the Fear Dimension more permanently. She noticed that Ian Quinn had gone missing and that Raina was dead, but Johnson told her teammates about Lewis Casalino, a man who had signed several death certificates for a series of Cybertek scientists, including Joseph Getty. Thus, May joined Phil Coulson, Alphonso Mackenzie and Johnson in an attempt to find Casalino.

May aims her gun at Tony Caine
The S.H.I.E.L.D. team successfully tracked down Casalino to a parking lot. Casalino tried to escape, but he was intercepted by May and Mackenzie. May pointed her gun at him, but the confrontation was quickly defused when Mackenzie recognized Casalino as Tony Caine, his friend and former roommate. Thus, May and the others, including Caine, returned to the Zephyr One where they requested Caine's assistance to find Getty.

May agrees to save Phil Coulson
Before leaving, however, May and Johnson also revealed that they counted on their Cybertek investigation to find a way to cure Coulson from his condition. Although Coulson clearly refused to sanction such endeavor and left, May and Johnson remained determine to heal him.

Thanks to Getty, S.H.I.E.L.D. went in a search for the Principia, a boat which was transporting Gravitonium before being allegedly sunk. Actually, the Gravitonium in the ship had been supercharged, causing it to take the ship into the air, where S.H.I.E.L.D. found it. While Coulson, Johnson and Mackenzie left to search it, May was asked to remain in the Zephyr One in order to pilot it should anything go wrong.

May monitors the mission on the Principia
May monitored the team's progression inside the Principia. They successfully located a small quantity of Gravitonium, but were also confronted by some Sleeper Mechs, the same androids they had faced during the Infiltration into St. Louis Aerospace Facility. May watched the fight through her teammates' body cams, urging them to evacuate the ship as it could fall back down into the sea at any time. Eventually, S.H.I.E.L.D. was successful and the Gravitonium brought back into the Zephyr One.

As S.H.I.E.L.D. thanked Caine for his assistance, May asked him to look into Cybertek's research files and to find anything which could help Coulson. May and her teammates then returned to the Lighthouse, and May openly voiced her suspicions that General Hale, who was associated with the Sleeper Mechs, had another allegiance than the United States Armed Forces, unaware that Hale was actually the last leader of HYDRA.

Capture of Phil Coulson
May orders Carl Creel to step out of his car
Thanks to contact numbers provided by Piper and to their decryption by Daisy Johnson, S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to track down General Hale. Thus, May joined a mission with Phil Coulson and Piper in which they successfully captured Hale into the Zephyr One, keeping her prisoner in the plane. However, while Coulson interrogated Hale, May was approached by Piper who told her that they could not force Hale's driver to leave his car. May went to see him and recognized the driver as Carl Creel, who revealed that he was carrying a bomb belt.

May threatens Anton Ivanov
May then joined Coulson and Piper as a Quinjet had docked the Zephyr One, revealing that Anton Ivanov was also working with Hale. Ivanov explained to May and her teammates that they were trying to avert a global extinction event and demanded for Hale to be released. Once Hale and Creel joined them, Hale requested to take Coulson with her. May refused, but Coulson was willing to accept as long as his teammates were spared. Infuriated by his decision, May blamed Coulson for what she called suicidal tendencies, but eventually went along with his decision and let him go with Hale.

May returned to the Lighthouse, where she and Johnson investigated on Hale and her associates, eventually deducing that Hale belonged to HYDRA. As they had no means to interrogate other HYDRA members, May decided to go and interrogate Leo Fitz. Indeed, Fitz had recently experienced a major psychic split which had caused his dark Framework personality of the HYDRA leader known as The Doctor to resurface. May told Fitz that she needed his help and presented him with several documents, asking for his insights regarding Hale and why she needed Coulson.

Fitz suggested that Hale was building a Gravitonium-based weapon, but requested to be temporarily released to help his teammates. While May was ready to accept, they were joined by Johnson, who strongly refused to let Fitz go despite May's attempts to convince her that they had to work together. May remained mostly silent during the ensuing argument between Fitz and Johnson, which ended when Johnson angrily left. May followed her out of the cell and Johnson informed her that she intended to find Robin Hinton for help, although May was reluctant to the idea.

Confessing her Love
Despite her reluctance, May agreed to accompany Daisy Johnson for a reunion with Robin Hinton. Before they departed, they were approached by Jemma Simmons, who wanted to talk about Leo Fitz's ideas about General Hale. Johnson strongly insisted that Fitz could not be released, which caused May to almost say something about it. Once Simmons left, May advised Johnson to have a less harsh leadership over S.H.I.E.L.D. as this situation was new to everyone, but Johnson barely listened to her, claiming that she would lead them to Phil Coulson.

May remained in the Zephyr One while Johnson left to find Robin Hinton. When the little girl returned, she called May her mother due to being lost between times and referring to the time when May adopted her after the Destruction of Earth. May then sat with Robin and explained that they were looking for Coulson who, according to Robin, could "put all the pieces together". May was also worried when Robin said that Coulson would die. However, while reviewing the girl's drawings, she found one which could represent Coulson, standing in a snowy and mountainous area with another man.

May showed the drawing to Johnson and Deke Shaw and they immediately tried to locate the place depicted by the drawing. While they searched for it, May had a talk with Robin's mother Polly, who had noticed May's connection to her daughter. However, Polly did not blame May for this link she barely had with Robin, as she knew that she would die in the catastrophe S.H.I.E.L.D. was trying to avoid.

The team eventually identified the location and put the Zephyr One above the area, but were unable to locate Coulson, as they were not even sure that they could find him since they did not know when the events showed on the drawings would come true. Despite fearing to be spotted by Hale and her troops, May agreed that they should land and search for Coulson on the ground. May, Johnson and Shaw made their way through the snow and the forest and eventually found Coulson, as well as Glenn Talbot, who had escaped from Hale's base and were being chased by Ruby Hale.

May rescues Phil Coulson and Glenn Talbot
While Johnson remained behind to fight Ruby, May took Coulson and Talbot to safety in the Zephyr One. They then took off the plane once Johnson returned with a wounded Shaw, who had been shot by Hale. During the flight, May attempted to reach out the Lighthouse to inform about their arrival and need of medical assistance, but no one responded. Arriving at the Lighthouse with Shaw on the verge of dying, May and the others were brought up to date by Alphonso Mackenzie, who told them that Simmons, Fitz and Yo-Yo Rodriguez had left the Lighthouse.

In Simmons' absence, May asked Piper to oversee Shaw's surgery. During the operation, May requested to speak with Coulson alone. She blatantly blamed him for his behavior, accusing him of giving up on the idea of fighting and disapproving with his decision of making Johnson the team's leader so early. As Coulson tried to defend his position, claiming that his sacrifice had brought them something, May told him that he could not take such decisions alone and abruptly confessed her love for him, leaving him speechless.

Attack on HYDRA Facilities
On her way to a team meeting, May was approached by Phil Coulson, who wanted to talk about May's earlier declaration. However, May claimed that this was not the time as they had a mission to find their missing colleagues Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons and Yo-Yo Rodriguez. May and Daisy Johnson explained to the team that they had pinpointed a signal apparently coming from Hale's Sleeper Mechs to a location in the Appalachian Mountains leading to Hale's base of operations. May and Johnson intended to attack the facility and left the Lighthouse with the Zephyr One.

May attacks the HYDRA Preparatory Academy
While preparing for their assault, May was asked by Johnson if she was fine, but May replied that she simply needed to unleash her frustration. She then went into the plane's Containment Module with Johnson, which was dropped down to the HYDRA Preparatory Academy. May and Johnson successfully took down several HYDRA operatives and eventually found Hale. Much to their surprise, Hale immediately surrendered and asked for their help, which May could not believe. However, Hale insisted, claiming that their friends were in danger because of her daughter Ruby and Johnson agreed to take her to the Zephyr One.

May, Johnson and Hale went to the HYDRA Herefordshire Facility and arrived in the middle of Ruby's infusion with the Gravitonium. May remained astonished when she was Ruby levitating out of the Particle Infusion Chamber and screaming in pain due to voices she heard in her mind. Ruby attacked Fitz and Simmons but eventually let them go, enabling May to take care of them and take them to safety. On their way, they encountered Yo-Yo Rodriguez, who was returning into the room where Ruby and Johnson were. May, Fitz and Simmons remained outside for a moment, but eventually returned when a powerful outburst occurred. As Johnson informed them that Rodriguez had murdered Ruby out of revenge, May noticed that Hale had disappeared.

Siege of the Lighthouse
May took part to a S.H.I.E.L.D. meeting during which Phil Coulson exposed his plan of sending the Gravitonium they had reclaimed into the sun. May also told the team that she had contacted Tony Caine, who she had secretly tasked to investigate on the Project Deathlok, in order to put Carl Creel, Robin Hinton and Polly Hinton to safety. The events of the Infiltration into the HYDRA Herefordshire Facility were also addressed, although May remained mostly silent during the argument between her teammates. She then left to help Daisy Johnson prepare for her secret meeting with Caine outside and they renewed their promise to do everything to keep Coulson alive, even if it meant going against Coulson's orders.

May then returned in the control room, where she witnessed the sudden appearance of Qovas' Ship, as the Remorath leader demanded the Gravitonium to be delivered to him. May listened as Coulson directly refused to meet Qovas' request. Once the negotiations were over, May and Coulson watched a recorded message from Rick Stoner indicating them the protocols which had been enacted, but Coulson made the mistake to select the nuclear hazard option, causing the Lighthouse to go into lockdown for a planned period of 15 years, much to May's anger.

May and Coulson were later joined by Yo-Yo Rodriguez, and they wondered why Johnson had not returned to the Lighthouse yet. Although she had covered for her until this moment, May revealed that Johnson was looking for a way to save Coulson. While Coulson strongly disapproved this plan, May was also surprised to hear Rodriguez claiming that her future self had warned her about such projects which could cause the Destruction of Earth. However, May refused to believe that they should let Coulson die, instead preferring to rely on Robin's words who had said that Coulson could bring "all the pieces back together".

May learns about the Remorath
Nevertheless, the debate was interrupted as the Remorath began to invade the Lighthouse, using their Phase Harmonic Teleportation Device. May listened to Deke Shaw's explanations about these extraterrestrial enemies and remained in the control room to withstand a siege with Coulson and Alphonso Mackenzie. They were later joined by Leo Fitz, who had been rescued by Shaw and gave them handcrafted combustible in order to light fires and counteract the Remorath's technology. While waiting for their opponents, May was given a handgun by Coulson.

May fights against the Remorath
May fiercely fought against the Remorath, firing numerous bullets at them, but she soon found out that the Remorath were incredibly durable and that her gun was of little use. Eventually, May ran out of ammunition, much like most of her teammates. As a group of Remorath surrounded them, May prepared to go in hand-in-hand combat, but Mackenzie gave her a metal rod to defend herself. May successfully held her own against the attackers until they were all slaughtered by Glenn Talbot, who had infused himself with Gravitonium. May then watched in complete shock as their enemies were defeated and Talbot took Coulson with him up in the air and outside the Lighthouse.

Rescue of Phil Coulson
May in the aftermath of the recent siege
In the aftermath of the Siege of the Lighthouse, May worried about the fact that Phil Coulson had left with a psychologically unstable and newly empowered Glenn Talbot. As they needed to know the whereabouts of the Remorath, May found Alphonso Mackenzie on the verge of executing Qajax, who had survived the battle, and told him that they needed the Remorath alive. May took part to Qajax's interrogation, but she was barely able to extract answers from him before he died due to the effects of the Odium he had taken. She then asked Jemma Simmons to perform an autopsy on Qajax to learn more about the Remorath and the Odium.

May then found Yo-Yo Rodriguez and Daisy Johnson fighting in the corridors of the Lighthouse. She fired her gun at the ceiling to make them stop. She informed them that they had spotted Qovas' Ship and that they would leave as soon as the Zephyr One could be able to be taken into space. May also warned Rodriguez that they would do anything to keep Coulson alive despite her warnings, and ordered her to leave if she did not want to help them in their endeavor.

May takes the Zephyr One into space
As the Zephyr One was equipped with new RCS thrusters relying on Gravitonium, May joined a mission in order to rescue Coulson and Talbot. Along with James Davis, she put the plane in vertical position and piloted the Zephyr One into space, enabling the aircraft to stealthily approach the Remorath spaceship using the plane's cloaking. Once they were docked to Qovas' ship, May and Quake infiltrated it. They quickly made their way through the spacecraft, taking down several Remorath soldiers in the process.

May threatens Glenn Talbot
However, May and Quake realized that the situation had gone incredibly wrong while they were looking for Coulson. Indeed, Talbot had grown mad because of his powers and had turned on S.H.I.E.L.D., instead allying with Qovas and the Confederacy. Despite May's attempts to convince Talbot that they were here to rescue him, Talbot attacked Quake, rendering her unconscious, and murdered General Hale, who was also present. May raised her weapon at Talbot, but he threatened to kill Coulson as well and May was forced to surrender. She was then taken into a cell with Coulson by the Remorath.

May and Phil Coulson are detained by Qovas
As Qovas locked them up in their cell, May warned him that they would eventually defeat him, and that they would do so without a gun. Once imprisoned, May and Coulson talked about Talbot, being genuinely surprised at the idea that they were concerned about someone who they had initially known as an antagonist but who had become a close ally. As Coulson commented on how people could change, May replied that it did not mean that they could save Talbot, although Coulson insisted that they should try.

May and Phil Coulson look for an escape
May and Coulson prepared to escape from their cell using Phil Coulson's Prosthetic Hand's capabilities, only to find out the door opening thanks to Deke Shaw who had come to their rescue. However, as they progressed through the ship's corridors, they were still unable to find where they should go in order to save Johnson and to escape: indeed, much to May's disappointment, Shaw could not read the different writings in the ship. They were then confronted by two Remorath who were promptly taken down by Quake, who had escaped.

May kisses Phil Coulson
May came up with a plan to escape and to avoid that the Lighthouse could be hit by Qovas' Ionizer Missiles: she would remain with Shaw to change the missiles' target to the ship itself and escape with the Phase Harmonic Teleportation Device, while Coulson and Quake would leave with the Zephyr One. However, Coulson refused the plan, claiming that they should remain together. This led to an argument which was interrupted by the arrival of other Remorath. In order to protect her, Coulson dragged May behind his Energy Shield and passionately kissed her.

May and Deke Shaw kill Remorath soldiers
May was eventually allowed to proceed with her plan and left with Shaw. They fought and defeated two other Remorath soldiers, and May ripped off their claws in order to defend herself should more soldiers were to come. Meanwhile, May tasked Shaw to change the missile's target's coordinates to the ship and to load the Lighthouse's coordinates in the teleporting device. However, they were stopped in their endeavor by Qovas, who engaged in a fight against May.

May reveals her trickery to Qovas
May managed to hold her own against Qovas, despite fighting with considerably smaller claws than his, while Shaw finished to enter the Lighthouse's location in the teleporting device. Although May lost one her claws during the duel, she managed to punch Qovas away, causing Qovas to get angry and to proceed to the launch of the missiles. Smiling, May revealed that they had changed the target. They then teleported away moments before the spaceship's destruction, safely arriving in the Lighthouse, where they contacted Coulson and Quake, who were also returning, albeit more slowly, with the Zephyr One.

The team faces a dilemma about Phil Coulson
However, once Coulson returned, May learned that he was sicker than ever. She joined a team meeting during which they were faced with a crucial dilemma: they could either use the Centipede Serum brought back by Johnson to save him, or they could use it in combination with the Odium to craft a weapon to kill Talbot and save the world, but they could not do both.

Battle of Chicago
During the debate within S.H.I.E.L.D. about what to do with the Centipede Serum, May sided with Daisy Johnson who considered that they should trust Robin Hinton's prophecy about Coulson "putting the pieces together". Indeed, May feared that even if they created a weapon by using the Odium, it could fail to kill Glenn Talbot, meaning that they would have sacrificed Phil Coulson's life for nothing. As the discussion heated up and Yo-Yo Rodriguez seized the Centipede Device, May smashed the vial of Odium so that they would only have one option left. She then apologized to Rodriguez and gave the Centipede Device to Leo Fitz for him to make the cure.

May asks Phil Coulson to take his remedy
During their flight to Chicago, where Talbot had been spotted laying waste across the city, May went to see Coulson, who was forced to remain in his bed. Although Coulson insisted that he disagreed with May's decision, May told him that she had confessed her feelings for him and that he now had a choice to build a relationship together. May urged him to take the cure before leaving. As they approached Chicago, Johnson gathered the team and admitted that she was not fit to lead S.H.I.E.L.D.. She appointed Alphonso Mackenzie as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., which May agreed along with the rest of the team. She was then pleasantly surprised to see Coulson back on his feet, having apparently taken the cure.

May decides to go into Qovas' Ship
During the Battle of Chicago, May worked with Fitz and Mackenzie to evacuate the civilians to the Zephyr One. On top of one building, May and Mackenzie found Robin, who told them that her mother Polly was still trapped in the remnants of Qovas' Ship which had been dragged by Talbot. While Mackenzie left, May hugged Robin in comfort. However, when Fitz joined them, he remembered that neither Mackenzie nor Polly survived in the future they had seen. Therefore, May and Fitz decided to infiltrate the ship as well.

May cries as Leo Fitz dies
May and Fitz arrived in time to save Mackenzie and Polly from two Remorath soldiers. May managed to take one down and ripped off his claw, throwing it to Fitz so he could stab the other one from behind. They then safely made it out of the spaceship, but a pile of rubble fell down on Fitz, forcing May and Mackenzie to clear the debris. They managed to remove the stones, but also found out that Fitz had been mortally wounded and that he would not survive. Thus, May remained at Fitz's side until the very end, crying over the death of her friend.

Despite this tragic loss, S.H.I.E.L.D. was victorious against Talbot, who had been killed by Quake. May returned to the Lighthouse, where she destroyed the shard of the Time Di'Alla which was still in their possession and which they no longer needed. She then joined her friends to share a drink as Coulson, who had actually not taken the cure which had enabled S.H.I.E.L.D. to win, announced that he would retire from S.H.I.E.L.D. while the other agents would look for the version of Fitz who was still frozen in space.

Tahiti
May with Phil Coulson during his last days
In the aftermath of the Battle of Chicago, May chose to retire from S.H.I.E.L.D. and to stay with Phil Coulson and accompany him in his last days in Tahiti. Both of them remained on a beach, commenting on its beauty. Now alone and ready to start a relationship, even though Coulson's days were numbered, May and Coulson discussed about what the latter wanted to do to enjoy his last moments, with Coulson expressing his interest in parasailing. They then watched as the Zephyr One departed, with their friends continuing their S.H.I.E.L.D. missions without them.

May smiles at Coulson
May spent Coulson's last weeks with him on the island, where the pair drank wine, slept on the beach, and went on dates. During this time, May conceived the idea of reforming S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy in Coulson's name, which Coulson approved of. Coulson passed away in his sleep shortly after and May buried him.

Sarge's Campaign
Recruiting Agents And New Problems
After Coulson's death, May returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. again. and, meanwhile, it took a year to rebuild and rehabilitate S.H.I.E.L.D. before the eyes of the world, in the meantime also recruiting new agents, such as Julian, Runco, Diaz, Fox and Damon Keller; above all, since Simmons is absent because he is looking for Fitz who is hibernating in space, they are looking for intelligent scientists who can replace them, such as Marcus Benson. Before Simmons left, the latter spoke of anomalies that occurred in the world, but they could not understand what it was, so, in his absence, May, together with director Mack and the other agents, kept an eye on these strange anomalies, in case they get stronger.

Every day, to monitor these anomalies, May and Yo-Yo, together with the assault teams, flew blindly with Quinjet waiting for new orders and coordinates, in case they should occur. Seeing that there is little activity of these anomalies, on Earth, Mack ordered May and the other agents to go in all directions, because where the anomalies will occur they will have to arrive immediately to see what it is. After Fox saw that the strongest anomaly occurred in a park in Castleton, Indiana, May and Keller's team immediately headed there, where they discovered that it was a man who caused those anomalies. May ordered the man to surrender or they would open fire, in which Keller anxiously awaited May's order, during which May asked him not to shoot because there were innocent boys, but the man refusing to surrender, he pulled out a plasma rifle and hit the wing of Quinjet in full, making them fall, but thanks to May's flying skills, they managed to successfully fall without injuring the innocent.

After checking that the agents were fine, May got angry at having escaped that man and Keller immediately requested the extraction after he found that the Quinjet systems are completely gone, thinking that the manager could worry, but May corrected him, saying that he could be pissed off if he found out that the man ran away.

As predicted by May, Mack scolded them for letting the man escape and asked what it would take if they didn't get him. Keller tried to explain that he had a clear view, but May stopped him from not letting him open fire because the boys were there. Mack said they had done the right thing, but they had to get off the ground and not shoot from above. Fox said other agents were needed if Yo-Yo had caught up with them, but Yo-Yo said she was on another Quinjet and reminded Mack that in the past three days he has talked about speed and getting there on time, in case these occur anomalies and to capture the person who caused them, but Yo-Yo did not know how to call them in another way, since they had used them many times, but Mack remembered that they were a different thing, the anomalies of a year ago, that is those of hallucinations that came to life and those anomalies of today are a distorted reality.

Fox exaggeratedly said that they could be a deformation of reality itself or storms of atypicalness, but Mack replied that his ideas did not help him, however he was relieved that no innocent person was involved, not even agents. He asked if everyone is fine, even if it was not needed. After they nodded that they are fine, May took the word that at least they know that it was a man who caused those anomalies, despite not knowing who or what he is. Mack then ordered to say many theories, even if they were trivial, but Yo-Yo said that two brilliant minds were missing and asked Mack if he hadn't heard them anymore, to which he replied that he hadn't received news for months.

Fox replied that his friend Keller has a theory, during which, after thanking the former for giving him the floor, he said that they had looked at all the positions looking for a connection: That the places where these anomalies were formed are found on the Lay Lines, which would help them narrow their search; and told everyone that he was a great expert on stupid theories. Mackenzie, believing Keller's theory, then ordered Keller and Fox to continue his research and ordered Yo-Yo to train with May, seeing that that sniper looked like a monster and could have to fight us if necessary. Mackenzie then went to his check-in office, which made Fox curious about who the manager should be accountable for. Keller told him that it was Phil Coulson, the head of the director, who had left a few discs to Mackenzie to help him.

May entered Mack's office, right in the middle of listening to a projection of Coulson from the Toolbox, who gave advice to Mack on how to manage the role of director, asking him if he still looked at them, to which Mack confessed to not being able to stop. May replied that Coulson would be proud of him, and that the agents know that he is good at the role of director, but Mack replied that he would never be better than Coulson in his role as director as the latter did, but May he reassured him, telling him that he was a director other than Coulson and that it's not a bad thing. Mack told her that there is no point in reminding her what day will be tomorrow, to which May replied that she knew it well.

Mack wanted to commemorate him by appointing a new department head, but that he had to wait for May to give him a name, in which the latter told him that he was thinking about it and Mack hoped he would say it and also told her that, although a year has passed, at least they had managed to share some wonderful time together, a few months before Coulson died, and May told him that they had shared even more. To change the subject, May told him that he should have news about what they had discussed by the evening, to which Mack nods and also congratulated her on the recruitment, but reminded her that smart brains are needed, not only the muscles.

While May trained Yo-Yo, he gave her advice on how to properly control the position of the feet during combat, and to improve the poker face, during which Yo-Yo asked what it would be useful for while fighting; May replied that it didn't hurt to have her, in case she needed it, but in reality she was referring to the previous meeting and about Agent Keller, during which she confessed that she is very attracted to Yo-Yo and that it is mutual that she does not laugh at his jokes. The latter asked if the attraction she feels for Keller is against the rules, but May replied no and, instead of stopping Yo-Yo, she encouraged her to go out with him and to frequent him, that Mack would soon understand and that he didn't have to worry about hurting the latter's feelings. Yo-Yo replied that even if what she said was easy, he didn't know how to do it, but May said that Mack is an adult man and can take care of himself.

Yo-Yo points out to May that he had tried to resolve the crisis on their relationship with Mack, but the latter plunged headlong into his work by locking himself in his office and, above all, Yo-Yo pointed out to May that he was not closed there to avoid distractions from his job, but he threw Yo-Yo out of his life. May told her that, despite having lived many, a year had passed and she also said that in these years she had learned that life is not meant to be alone, thus amazing Yo-Yo. May pointed out to her that despite the advice she had given her, she does not often give them good advice, only rarely; in fact, Yo-Yo was amazed that she had talked a lot for the first time, and asked her if she was feeling well. She also said that Keller was cute, despite Yo-Yo saying that he was not his type and so May advised her to improve her poker face by resuming her training.

Recruiting Marcus Benson
After training with Yo-Yo Rodriguez, he went to look for Mack in a club that the latter often visits and that goes there every night, which, as May says, is a great ritual. Mack explained that Coulson's computer spirit advised him to find a way to keep his feet on the ground and keep in touch with the people he is fighting for. May asked him, therefore, if drinking in a club was one of his rituals and Mack replied that it was one of the three, so he lists them: to be the big boss in the morning, bartender in the evening and for mass on Sunday, but May interrupted him in not tell her that he had come here for S.H.I.E.L.D. matters, but because he likes draft beer, which Mack laughed heartily and told her that she was glad she came too, but May revealed that this time she was the one coming for questions of the S.H.I.E.L.D., showing him some documents, telling him that he is almost in charge of finishing.

Mack asked her what that "almost" was, asking her if she stopped saying no, but May asked him to convince him himself to be recruited. Mack asked her now and place and she wanted to bring him here at this very moment, to Mack's irritation because this place was a sacred place for him and May made the joke, believing that it was the church, the sacred place. The latter told him that the man was at the end of the counter.

Mack tried to introduce himself to the man, but had no answer, forcing May to introduce him herself, saying that the man was Marcus Benson, Direcor of Natural Sciences at Culver University and that he was the teacher, then colleague and then the friend of the May's ex-husband: Andrew Garner, to whom Benson allowed her to call him what she likes. Benson said May had told him more in a phone call than in all the years she was married to Andrew Garner, with no detail that didn't interest him and protested that he would never hunt the mysterious man with them, but Mack pointed out that he had driven at least two hours to reach them and Benson confessed that it was the fault of the university, that he had created that department from scratch, but that now they have canceled the lessons to lighten the load and therefore he did not know whether to blame to alcohol or to May and Mack, calling them incapable spies who poke the nose of other people's affairs. May told him that she never got in the way and forced him to admit that he continued to drink very often, making Benson suspect that he had spied on him, but said that he always drank glasses with her husband and that, since he died, it has become a way to remember or forget his memory.

After listening to what Benson said, Mack told the latter that he hoped that alcohol would not drown his curiosity and that he would bring out the best in himself if he was recruited, telling him that they too had lost someone. who was an exceptional leader and teacher for them and who did not want to forget him and who tried to fill the void that he had released to leave, but they needed intelligent minds.

To those last words, Benson replied that although Mackenzie spoke in the plural, he himself has only one, but Mack said he wanted him to discover others, showing him some documents from the S.H.I.E.L.D. and that they would never open it instantly, but in a year or two and that Benson could have helped them lay the foundations to honor Coulson and revive the S.H.I.E.L.D. and, as Mack himself would have understood about Benson, the academy could be a renaissance for him too.

Benson asked if, if he accepted, what would happen, to which Mack replied that he swears he would never lie to him, but that there were urgent matters and May added that Benson served for a guess in existing fields that he himself believed only theorists. Benson started to leave, but May called him back and the first replied that it was not what he wanted, since he was too old and lost for those things, Mack replied that, despite what Benson himself said, he was the best scientist more intelligent than they could afford, explaining that their current brightest scientists are in deep space and cannot contact them. So until they returned from the space mission, Benson had to help them, otherwise thousands of innocent people will die. At the words "Deep Space", Benson tried to ask if that story was true, to which Mack replied yes.

After returning to the Lighthouse with Benson, Benson was amazed when he met a man stuck inside a concrete wall, asking if it was too late to quit the job. Mack asked Benson what he thought and the latter replied that he would have a theory, if it were covered with concrete, but said that it was partially made of concrete and that it did not end there, because he had discovered cybernetic components on the neck, asking to Mack if it wasn't a lens; but the man took Benson by the collar of his shirt, saying that something is coming and that they would never stop it. After helping Benson to let go of his hold, Mack asked what was coming, when the man replied that it was Pachakutiq and that they had to say goodbye to their world, before becoming concrete again.

May, having become frightened, got angry with Benson for not detecting even a beat, to which he replied that he had no heart and, just before he could reply, something fell from the concrete man, believing that she was a bomb. Benson picked it up, reassuring others that it wasn't a bomb, but a timer with a position.

Destruction of the Museum of Natural History
Seeing the coordinates, Mack went to the control room and asked Fox to write the coordinates of the next anomaly and the latter, after writing them, suspected that Keller said, to say, that the anomalies were on the Lay Lines, to which Mack gives him the reason. The latter ordered Keller and Fox to go immediately to the place and asked May and Yo-Yo to take command of the mission, to which they accepted and the latter asked them to let them know by radio where to go exactly.

After arriving at the location of the coordinates, that is, in front of the museum of natural history, May, Yo-Yo, Keller, Fox and the other agents quickly got into position to take down the culprits, when they left, and ordered the agents to clear the area to keep the innocent away, to avoid getting involved. As they were approaching to enter, they saw a woman saying that the men wanted to kill the hostages, including her son and Fox who took the woman and rescued her, asking if she had been injured. Mack ordered May not to show up and quickly check what was going on. Keller, meanwhile, saw from the sight of the rifle that two men were moving away and felt that the woman they had rescued told Fox to be silent and that he would turn into a butterfly, making the agents suspect; and when the woman bent over, the agents realized that there was a bomb and Keller told the agents to stay down, but the bomb exploded, overwhelming the agents.

The explosion temporarily deafened May and Yo-Yo, to whom the former asked the latter if she was okay. Meanwhile, the woman tried to escape, but was overwhelmed by Fox and handcuffed. After verifying that Yo-Yo was fine, May tried to understand what had happened, but through the portal a truck arrived that overwhelmed May and the other S.H.I.E.L.D cars.
A man got out of the truck and when he got to May's view he was frighteningly identical to Phil Coulson. May saw the man ask Fox to let the woman go, but he hesitated, believing that it was Phil Coulson and that he belonged to the S.H.I.E.L.D., but the man did not listen to him and shot him to death, saying that he had never heard that name. May, being weakened, saw the man get on the truck with the woman and they left quickly, leaving her there to rework on what she saw.

Shocking Discovery
After gathering at the lighthouse after Fox's death, in addition to offering condolences, Mack told S.H.I.E.L.D.. Fox's choice to join the organization; and that is to protect people from their worst nightmares. Even if they can no longer save him, they had to protect as many innocent people as possible to avoid the sudden deaths of people accidentally involved and who had to find solutions immediately. Then, the director ordered Geros and Runco to see if there are any more riots and Keller to see the records of the Museum of Natural History to figure out something he may have missed and is being helped by Yo-Yo; then he ordered May to continue the search for the truck she saw and to sound the alarm immediately if there is any news.

After the agents went to work on their respective duties, May privately argued with Mack to find out if she had spoken to the truck driver, but the latter asked her to be patient. She asked him if he didn't believe her what he was saying and he replied that he believes she saw Coulson, but that he wouldn't spread the news until she clearly understood what it really is.

After being informed of a heist at a convenience store in Ohio, May and Mack asked Benson if he could help them find a lead on this and that they had brought them evidence for him to analyze, which he accepted and asked to the director to add them to the pile he had yet to analyze, because he was still working on the cemented man and also protested that he had given up his post at the University to be buried under the Lighthouse forever.

May, ignoring Benson's complaints, asked him if he had any theories about Coulson's look-alike that she had seen and he replied that the hypotheses about him are very different than what scientists in general say when they don't have precise answers; Benson said that one of these theories is connected to previous S.H.I.E.L.D. mistakes, on which he is writing a very long list, such as the living manifestations of fear, the Nanomasks and the Inhumans and he wanted to evaluate and reread the documentation on the Life-Model Decoy, because it's a rather complicated subject for him, to which Mack agreed.

May asked if the look-alike she saw could be one of them and Benson replied that if Coulson already had one it could be a plausible explanation and that she wanted to talk to the idiot who designed them, but Mack and May say they find it hard to find, because the creator of those syntetic robots died two and a half years ago.

Another Sighting and Protests by Marcus Benson
Mack, guarding that squad of mercenaries, suspected they were looking for something and said they would watch them when they find it. May, on the other hand, was looking at Fox's photo and also said he was a good man; then he advised Mack to go talk to Keller and console him, since he had been the one to recruit Fox, but Mack disagreed, because he knew who he was going to be comforted by.

While looking at the satellite map, May and Mack spotted a man who had fired a strange weapon outside the shipping center in Cincinnati, not far from the convenience store they had robbed in Ohio and who, luckily for them, had been identified by security. . May also related that one of them was with the one posing as Coulson and Mack ordered them to examine the scene and he himself will also tell the other agents that there is a new target that is identical to their deceased boss, but, as they passed in front of Benson's laboratory, the latter had heard everything and replied that, despite being offered a place in exchange for transparency and solitude, he was in the dark about everything.

Mack replied that they had already told him everything they knew, but Benson replied that they had left out a small detail: that Phil Coulson, 5 and a half years ago, was already dead and brought back to life. Mack assured him that this was not the case, however Benson replied that the theory that Coulson was a Life-Model Decoy led nowhere and the replicants had never had the DNA, although Yo-Yo swore they had thought of bringing him back to life, but they had not done so out of respect for her decision to let him die. Benson then blurted out that he wasn't dead and aggressively asked Melinda if she had anything to say, as she loved secrets, angering her, although Mack told him to moderate his tone.

May testified that she saw him die with her own eyes, as she accompanied him in his final days in Tahiti and that Benson shouldn't have dared to doubt that Coulson is dead; then he asked him that he would either help them find out how to kill that entity that has his face or he would go back to the bar if it was hard for him and Benson chose the latter option, before saying they had to study the evidence themselves, but Mack silenced the argument, making Benson calm down.

Taking advantage of the calm, Mack asked if the DNA he was analyzing was what he said, to which Benson said yes, showing him a sample taken at the convenience store, saying that, at first, he thought it was alien, seeing that there were brands of unseen radiation and foreign methyl groups, but he saw that, once removed, what remained was the perfect match, with that of Coulson himself, even if it wasn't him.

Robbery of Charmont Jewelers
Following the trail of the truck to the shipping center, Yo-Yo Rodriguez, as soon as she arrived, asked May if they changed the vehicle and she said no, because otherwise they would have found the old truck. As May thought, Rodriguez wondered what they were doing in that shipping center, as there is nothing and the former replied that there was something to defend here and the latter replied that there was only one other. person between the feet, seeing the traces of that blow.

As Rodriguez checked, May replied how Damon Keller was doing and she replied that he wasn't very well, but he holds on. May asked her if they were dating, as Mackenzie thought so, but Rodriguez replied that if the manager was the man with the Phil Coulson's face. While they were talking, they were briefed by Mack about the sighting of the team of mercenaries who are robbing the Charmont Jewelers a kilometer away and that Keller and his team would join them in a moment and he advised them to watch out, which Yo-Yo and May agreed and set off right away.
