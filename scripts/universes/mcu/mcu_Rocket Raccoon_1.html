89P13, mainly known as Rocket, is a genetically enhanced creature and a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Alongside his friend and partner Groot, Rocket traveled the galaxy, committing crimes and picking up bounties until they met Star-Lord, who convinced them to assist him in selling the Orb for a massive profit. However, as it was discovered that the Orb being sought by Ronan the Accuser was one of the Infinity Stones, Rocket was convinced to risk everything to stop Ronan's plans to destroy Xandar. During the ensuing conflict, Rocket managed to assist his friends in destroying Ronan, despite Groot being killed. Rocket then became a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy alongside the newly planted baby Groot.

Rocket continued working with the Guardians when they were hired by the Sovereign to slay the Abilisk. However, Rocket took the job as a way to steal Anulax Batteries with the intention to later sell them. This angered Ayesha, causing her to declare war on the Guardians and hire the Ravagers to capture them. Rocket and Groot were soon captured by Taserface under Yondu Udonta's command, forcing Rocket and Udonta to work together in order to break free and kill Taserface. During his time with Udonta, Rocket learned how to better himself and wishing to save his Guardians family, joined Udonta during the Battle on Ego's Planet.

Four years later, the Guardians rescued Thor after the Asgardians were slaughtered by Thanos, who had resumed his quest for the Infinity Stones himself. The Guardians split up; while the rest of the team returned to Knowhere to find the Reality Stone, Rocket and Groot accompanied Thor to Nidavellir to obtain the weapon Stormbreaker. Using the Bifrost Bridge, the trio traveled to Earth to join the Battle of Wakanda, where he fought alongside Winter Soldier. Their efforts to stop Thanos were unsuccessful, and Rocket was one of the only Guardians to survive Thanos' subsequent mass slaughter, along with Nebula. Rocket joined the Avengers on their trip to the Garden, where Thor decapitated Thanos.

Rocket spent the next five years as a member of the Avengers under the command of Natasha Romanoff. In 2023, after discovering how to traverse through time safely, Rocket and Thor traveled back in time to 2013, where he extracted the Aether from Jane Foster on Asgard. With all six Infinity Stones used to resurrect the victims of the Snap, Rocket participated in the Battle of Earth against an alternate Thanos and his army. After attending Iron Man's funeral, Rocket left the Avengers and rejoined the Guardians, preparing to leave Earth and return to their cosmic adventures.

Biography
Early Life
Cybernetic Enhancements
89P13 was recovered by alien scientists and brought to the Halfworld planet in the Keystone Quadrant star system, where he was genetically and cybernetically enhanced so that he was given sentient levels of intelligence. However, years of abuse and repetitive genetic rewrite caused him to develop a vain and chaotic personality, driving him into becoming a gun slinging mercenary who called himself Rocket. Rocket's Nova Corps criminal record currently includes thirteen counts of theft, twenty two counts of escape from his incarceration, seven counts of mercenary activity, and fifteen counts of arson.

Deals at the Hub
Partnering with Groot, a Flora colossus from Planet X, Rocket made his way in the galaxy performing various acts of dubious legality. On one such adventure, Rocket and Groot made their way to the Hub without money and desperate for a job in order to buy fuel for their vehicle. A job came their way via Sqqd'li, under the orders of his employer the crime-lord Zade Scraggot, who hired Rocket and Groot to retrieve a package being held in the highly secure "Uptown" section of the station for 1000 Credits.

Rocket and Groot successfully retrieved the package, but upon discovering that the package contained a family of sentient Scalluscs, a snail-like creature that Scraggot was planning on harvesting for their shells, Rocket and Groot rescued the Scalluscs from their cruel fate after a brief scuffle with Scraggot and his men.

Quest for the Orb
Encountering Star-Lord
Rocket and Groot begin to look for bounties
Rocket and Groot traveled to Xandar, where he staked out potential bounty targets in a crowded plaza. While looking at the many Xandarians, Rocket ranted about how absurd the people looked such as insulting a man with a haircut, a child walking with his guardian, and a suspicious person talking to a woman. As Rocket was laughing at the locals, he turned to Groot and noticed him drinking water from a fountain, telling him to stop doing that in disgust.

Rocket finds Star-Lord as a worthy bounty
After Rocket had caught Groot lying about drinking, he picked up a signal from device and spotted Peter Quill with Bereet. As Rocket looked over Quill's stats, he noted that Quill was wanted for forty thousand Units and told Groot that they were going to be rich, before looking at Groot drinking the fountain again in despair. Moments before Star-Lord had tried to set up a deal with Broker and Gamora attempted to steal the Orb from him, Rocket intervened at the attack and tackled her with brute force.

Rocket quickly tackles Gamora with force
While Rocket tried to tell Groot to capture Star-Lord, he began to yell at Groot for mistaken for Gamora, before he was bitten in the hand by Gamora. As Rocket told Gamora to stay calm, he was thrown away for several feet and landed onto an open glass store. Gamora then prolonged her mission to capture the Orb and went after Star-Lord before they fought each other. As Star-Lord had celebrated his victory of defeating Gamora, Rocket ordered Groot to capture him.

Rocket witnesses Gamora's quick recovery
Groot then trapped Star-Lord with a huge bag and Rocket told him to quit smiling so they could act like professionals. Rocket's victory was short lived once Gamora recovered and shoved him away. After Gamora attacked Groot by slicing his arms off, she was then stunned by Star-Lord's Quad Blasters and proceeded to escape. Rocket took note of Star-Lord's escape and proceeded to shoot him down with his Laser Cannon.

Rocket is abruptly arrested by the Nova Corps
As Rocket taunt at Star-Lord's defeat, he noticed that Groot was saddened by his loss of arms. Rocket then noted that Groot's arms will grow back and told him to stop whining. Suddenly as the Nova Corps arrived at the scene, Rocket and Groot were hovered over and was told to drop his weapon. In a minor inconvenience, Rocket dropped his weapon in dissatisfaction and was arrested under the authority of the Nova Corps.

Held in the Kyln
Rocket arriving inside the Kyln
Once they all arrived in their holding cells, Rocket and the others were forced into a line up by the Nova Corps where all of their own criminal histories were presented for Garthan Saal by Rhomann Dey. Frustrated by his experience with the intergalactic law, Rocket began to growl while crossing his arms and spit on the ground.

Rocket is taken to the Kyln for his sentence
The group were all sent to the Kyln by Saal to begin their sentence, where they all arrived together and continued their disagreements. After bragging about escaping twenty two prisons and telling Peter Quill that he was lucky he was arrested, Rocket was told about being comparable by a normal Raccoon, in which he questioned Quill about it before telling him their is nobody like him. With Quill questioning what Gamora had planned for the Orb, Rocket listened to her plans on betraying Ronan the Accuser and selling the Orb to someone else.

Rocket explains Groot's limited vocabulary
As Groot kept talking, Quill wondered why he could only say three words repeatedly, Rocket explained that Groot doesn't speak well enough as the people like him and Quill, as his vocabulary is restricted to I, am, and Groot. Once Quill spotted one of the guards using his own Walkman and quickly stepped through the doorway into the guard's quarters in order to ensure it, Rocket watched as the situation escalated with Quill being electrocuted.

Rocket being dragged out by the Nova Corps
Rocket and all the others were then processed by the Nova Corps as he was stripped down and washed, abusing him. Soon finding himself escorted into a prison cell with Quill, Rocket was given his prison uniform and began dressing up, unknowingly having Quill looking behind his back with his cybernetic implants being shown off. Rocket and the other members of the group had finished being processed and stepped into the prison compound.

Rocket settles his arrival in the Kyln prison
As Rocket and the group walked inside the compound, he told Quill that the prison guards are here to stop prisoners from getting out and do not care for what they're doing inside their cells. As Quill found himself a target in the prison when a Monstrous Inmate attempted to start a fight, Groot saved him from by defeating him as Rocket claimed that Quill was their booty and no one else was to go near them or else their go through them.

Rocket wakes up from his prison group cell
Rocket went to sleep in the group quarters while Quill was concerned for Gamora's personal cell where the prisoners were. With Quill overhearing Gamora being abducted by one of the guards as well as some of the other prisoners, Rocket woke up and asked where Quill was going before he escaped from his cell. Rocket followed Quill up until Drax the Destroyer stopped to kill Gamora and Quill intervened, persuading him to kill Ronan the Accuser instead.

Rocket discusses the price of the Orb
As Quill left the room and told Gamora that she knows where to sell the Orb, Rocket joined in and confirmed that the group will eventually get out of Klyn, despite wanting Quill as his bounty. Gamora confessed afterward that the Orb was priced by her buyer for four billion Credits and offered to split the profits, and Rocket agreed to formulate a plan to break the four from the prison.

Escape
Rocket explains his plan to escape the Kyln
The next day, Rocket came up with a plan to break Peter Quill, Gamora, and Groot out of the Kyln, as a team they would collect a prisoner's prosthetic leg and one of the guards' control devices attached to their arms in order to hack into the security tower. Rocket further explained that a Quarnyx Battery can help him escape and remove the prison's emergency lockdown.

Rocket being frustrated with Groot yet again
Gamora then questioned Rocket of how they should get any supplies, in which he noted that some inmates find her attractive so maybe she could come up with some kind of trade. Quill then expressed his fear that the plan would be impossible to pull off, but Rocket angrily insisted that they should figure it out. As Rocket explained the plan again, the operation went awry when Groot completed the last step first, setting off the alarms and causing him to be frustrated.

Rocket firing security hoverbots from the Kyln
As Quill and Gamora retrieved the items needed, Rocket was berated by Kyln Hoverbots that were fired at Groot, causing chaos. As Rocket yelled at Groot's mistake for alarming the guards, Drax fought the guards that attempted to fire at him and Groot. Once Drax came to their aid and tossed one of the guards' weapons, Rocket began to shoot the Kyln Hoverbots with great pleasure, while laughing maniacally. Once Gamora gathered the green wiring that was required for the breakout, Rocket caught the item and told Groot move over to the watchtower.

Rocket hot wires the watchtower to escape
As Rocket continued his part of the plan until he was finally ready for all of the others to regroup with him, Rocket climbed up onto Groot's roots in order to get into the security tower. Once the group got into the watchtower and locked the door behind them, Rocket was given a prisoner's leg, in which he then revealed that stealing the leg was simply a joke, annoying Quill due to the money he had spent to get it. The group was soon found by a guard, who had gathered his team as they attempt to shoot the watchtower while Rocket worked.

Rocket gathers his belongings from his escape
Rocket then initiated his plan by switching off the prison's artificial gravity and took control of the Kyln Hoverbots, and used these Hoverbots to propel the watchtower room from the cellblock and into the prison's docking bay. Now safely out of the way of the Nova Corps, Rocket gathered his clothing while the others prepared to escape into deep space onboard the Milano. Quill then went off to collect his Walkman and gave Gamora his bag, claiming it contained the Orb.

Rocket impatiently waits for Star-Lord's escape
As the group retrieved their effects, Rocket parked the Milano and stayed behind and ordered the others to take his ship out into space while Quill retrieved his Walkman, much to the group's annoyance. Rocket grew impatient and asked Gamora if she had the Orb, but was discovered to be nothing. As soon as Rocket and Drax noticed Star-Lord arriving, he and the group let him in the ship to give back the Orb.

Gathering Materials
Rocket starts to build weapons on the Milano
On the Milano, Rocket began pulling apart bits of his ship to build weapons, including the Hadron Enforcer. Peter Quill then found Rocket's actions and was furiously telling him to stop. Once Quill noted that he did not want any bombs or moon destroying weapons on his ship, Rocket suggested putting the bomb in a box and even tried to use the box of Meredith Quill's present to Quill, to which he insisted to not touch it.

Rocket dismisses Star-Lord's crude joke
As soon as Quill had a talk to the group about where to sell the Orb, leading to an argument between Drax the Destroyer and Gamora in which Quill was forced to break up as he insisted that nobody kill anyone onboard his ship. Once Quill stated that the group needed to trust each other if they were actually going to start working as a team and Gamora showed little interest in having anything to do with any of them, Rocket listened to Quill's claim about his ship's filthy history, much to his dismissal.

Meeting the Collector
Rocket and the Guardians arrive at Knowhere
While piloting the Milano, Rocket informed the group that they were headed to inbound. As Rocket had piloted forward, Rocket was told by Gamora that they're now arriving on Knowhere, a remote mining outpost in space that was built in the giant severed-head of a Celestial.

Rocket drunkenly starts to party with his allies
As the group explored Knowhere, Rocket listened to Gamora's explanation of her reasoning of picking this particular location as the place to sell resources. Rocket then questioned Gamora if the Boot of Jemiah is where they would wait for the Orb's buyer to summon them. Accepting the locale, Rocket, Drax, and Groot playfully gambled on creatures lives while there while Gamora and Peter Quill conversed just outside.

Rocket starts to threaten Drax for his insults
As Rocket had a friendly drink with each other, he soon became drunk enough that he started to pick a fight with Drax for his disrespectful personality, which soon escalated into involving Groot in the fight. Intoxicated, a distraught Rocket accused Gamora and Drax of mocking him and seeing him as a monster, threatening to kill the others. Quill intervened before any harm was done and told Rocket put up with one night before he could be rich, but the outburst had caused Drax to leave.

Rocket is escorted into the Collector's Museum by Carina
While the group let Drax walk away, they were then greeted by Carina who finally invited them into the Collector's Museum, in which it was housed by several species and items in cages. While Taneleer Tivan summoned them to his museum; Rocket and a cosmonaut dog, Cosmo, snarled at each other as they passed. Tivan found himself interested in Groot, and asked for permission in displaying his corpse as an exhibit, while also referring to Rocket as Groot's pet, which nearly caused another outburst.

Rocket mocks the Collector's long speech
After formalities were over, Tivan revealed what was inside the Orb: the Power Stone, one of the Infinity Stones, a powerful elemental objects created by the Big Bang; so powerful that only the most powerful of beings were able to wield it, even if the burden of the power was separated among multiple people. Rocket was unimpressed by the explanation of the Stone's power and demanded that Tivan pay them.

Rocket and Groot escape from the explosion
As Tivan was withdrawing the money to pay the Guardians, his long-suffering assistant Carina, seeing a way to end her misery under Tivan's control, grabbed the Power Stone and shouting about how she will no longer be Tivan's slave. The result was a powerful explosion that disintegrated her and destroyed Tivan's entire museum. Groot managed to pick up and rush Rocket outside before the ensuing purple fireball could harm them, while Quill and Gamora barely survived by hiding from the blast and Tivan escaped with only an injured forehead.

Skirmish on Knowhere
Rocket tells the team to get rid of the Orb
Escaping away from the power that the Orb had carried, Rocket noticed Gamora had caught it, causing him to be frightened by the item inside it. As Gamora told the group that they should give the Power Stone over to the Nova Corps, Rocket objected her decision and suggested giving the Power Stone to Ronan the Accuser; however, Star-Lord abandoned the idea. Rocket asked why he chose to protect the Galaxy, only to be responded by Quill that he chose to protect the Galaxy for inhabitance.

Rocket battling against the Sakaaran army
Before they could continue arguing, Ronan and Nebula arrived with their entire army of Sakaarans behind them. Having learned that Drax the Destroyer had called his enemy for a chance to kill him to avenge his family. The group then noticed the Yondu Ravager Clan appeared, with the former having been called here by a vengeful Drax. Rocket and Gamora attempted to fight off Ronan's forces using Mining Pods while Drax tried to fight Ronan and Groot stayed behind. Rocket managed to use his Mining Pod's durability to his advantage by crashing through Ronan's Necrocrafts.

Rocket and Star-Lord watch Gamora freeze
Pursued by her sister Nebula and several other Necrocrafts, Gamora attempted to flee into open space, but her pod malfunctioned due to its inability to function outside of Knowhere and was promptly destroyed by Nebula. Once Nebula destroyed Gamora's Pod and retrieved the Orb, Rocket and Quill caught up with her unconscious body. As they watched from afar, as their Mining Pods did not have the power to get closer, Rocket sadly informed Quill that Gamora would not survive and to go back into Knowhere.

Rocket tells Star-Lord he'll die in seconds
Once Rocket recommended they turn back before they got trapped, Quill announced his coordinates to the Ravagers in order to reveal his location and exited his Mining Pod. Just as Star-Lord proceeded to exit his pod and flew through deep space to reach Gamora, Rocket protested that he would not be able to survive in the extreme conditions of deep space, but Quill placed his helmet onto her, causing him to leave before they were rescued by the Ravagers.

Rocket furiously yells at Drax the Destroyer
Rocket returned to Knowhere, angered at Drax for allowing Gamora and Quill to be captured and Ronan to retrieve the Infinity Stone. Once Drax accepted his mistake by being overtaken by his vengeance of his family, Rocket insensitively mocked Drax's family's death, telling him that it is no excuse for his actions. Wanting to leave Drax behind, Rocket told Groot that they should leave while they can to the farthest parts of the galaxy and possibly live in peace before Ronan finds them. However, Groot offered to aid Quill and Gamora with Drax wanting help, causing Rocket to angrily kick a patch of grass in response.

Rocket threatens Yondu Udonta and his men
Rocket then confronted the Ravagers in the Milano, gaining their attention by harmlessly firing upon the Eclector, and used a voice amplifying microphone, threatening to do greater damage. Rocket then ordered the outlaws to release Quill and Gamora while Drax aimed a Hadron Enforcer at them. The tension was resolved when Quill announced that they were fine and had temporarily resolved their conflict with the Ravagers.

Battle of Xandar
Accepting the Mission
Rocket expresses his discourge with Star-Lord
As the group had reunited inside the Milano, reviewed recent events and decided that it was up to them to prevent Ronan the Accuser from destroying Xandar with his Infinity Stone, Rocket was doubtful that they would succeed, upon hearing that Quill's plan for stopping Ronan was rob him despite the risk. Star-Lord berated Rocket for nearly blowing him and Gamora inside the Eclector after giving the Yondu Ravager Clan a count of five.

Rocket offers his statement to the team
Listening to Quill's rant, Rocket tells Quill that he didn't think about the consequence of his plan, blaming what will happen if he became altruistic yet never giving the time to be thanked, having Groot agreeing with him. Gamora then tells the group that they'll have the Ravagers' help to save Xandar. However, Rocket rebuttal her claim that it they'll just give the Stone to Yondu Udonta so he could sell to somebody even worse.

Rocket talks down to Star-Lord's partial plan
Once Quill tells that they figure something out with Udonta and the Stone, Rocket listened to Gamora's about stopping Ronan with Quill telling him that has a plan. Rocket questions if Quill has a plan in which he tells him that he has part of a plan, giving Rocket less hope. As the group had continued discussing a plan, Rocket asked Quill about what percentage, in which he expressed twelve percent. Rocket laughed hysterically at Quill, making sarcastic remarks along with it.

Rocket decides to stand up for his new team
As Groot told Rocket that the plan is higher than eleven percent, he angrily questions on Groot's thinking. Quill then tells the team that they know they had lost many things in their life but now it is the time give a shit about the people in the galaxy. Rocket tells Quill that what they're doing to stop Ronan is impossible only for the group to come along and agree to fight along side each other. Being dumbfounded on how they would die fighting for the galaxy, Rocket had no choice but stand up, admitting that he doesn't have a long lifespan.

Rocket prepares for battle on Xandar
As the group had then proceeded to stand together, Rocket tells that team is standing in a circle like a bunch of jackasses. Rocket then got his weapons ready and prepared for battle, including his Laser Cannon. With the whole team onboard with each other, Rocket joined them in a line and quickly adjust to himself before meeting up with the Ravagers with the plan in-store for them. As Ravagers had huddled up, Rocket and the rest of his team were equipped with tiny capsules in case of the Power Stone has been released.

Rocket prepares to pilot the M-Ship for takeoff
With the Yondu Ravager Clan, the group outlined a plan to prevent Ronan from destroying Xandar; they would contact the Nova Corps and convince them to aid them, Quill and Yondu Udonta would enter Ronan's ship, the Dark Aster, through a breach created by Rocket and Quill, and they would kill Ronan upon entering his chambers. Rocket attempted to get Vorker's cybernetic eye removed as part of the plan, but was quickly denied by Quill, much to his deep denial by covering up his laughter afterwards. Rocket then went over to pilot the Warbird for takeoff.

Protecting Xandar
Rocket flying his M-Ship under the Dark Aster
As the plan had settled in, Yondu Udonta sends multiple M-Ships through a breach, along with Rocket and his team flying into Xandar. As the Dark Aster began to fly into Xandar's atmosphere, Udonta ordered his clan to fire at it and tells rest of the team to submerge under Ronan the Accuser's ship.

Rocket firing through the Dark Aster’s breach
With a few Ravagers by his side, Rocket began firing at the side of the Dark Aster, Kraglin Obfonteri had started to do massive damage, making a hole on the ship. Rocket ordered Star-Lord and Udonta to come forward to his location; however, due to being hit by Ronan's ships, Udonta had to abandon the mission. As Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, and Groot fight off Ronan's army with aid of the Nova Corps, they enter the through the hole of Ronan's ship.

Rocket attacks Ronan the Accuser's army
With Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Groot inside the Dark Aster, Rocket aided the Nova Corps and Ravagers in preventing Necrocraft from attacking Xandar. Once the Nova Corps had formed a blockade to prevent the Dark Aster from going any further, Rocket started to fire at multiple Sakaarans attacking Xandar and told Garthan Saal that he would take care of the situation. As Ronan's army grew larger, Rocket and the rest of the Ravagers submerged down and destroyed the many incoming ships.

Rocket attempts to attack Ronan the Accuser
Just as Ronan decided to destroy the blockade with the Power Stone, Rocket witnessed the attack and told Quill to hurry up on heading towards Ronan after having the civilians evacuated but started to lose the battle. In desperation, Rocket crashed the Milano into the new hole in the Dark Aster, severely damaging both his and Ronan's ships and knocking himself unconscious.

Losing a Friend
Rocket is carried out by the Guardians
Once the damage from both Ronan the Accuser's use of the Infinity Stone and Rocket's crash caused the Dark Aster to begin falling towards the city below, Rocket was seen by Star-Lord and was picked up to meet with rest of the team. As the ship began crumbling down, Groot had the idea of creating a sphere of branches around his team.

Rocket begs Groot not to sacrifice himself
Seeing what was about to happen, Rocket woke up from getting knocked out and saw Groot creating a sphere of branches around him. As the spores had lit up the room, Rocket realized what Groot was doing and tearfully begged Groot to reconsider, however, Groot gently wiped a tear from his friend's eye before telling him "We are Groot" moments before the ship crashed to the ground.

Killing Ronan the Accuser
Rocket threatens to kill Ronan the Accuser
Once the Dark Aster had crashed onto Xandar, Rocket and the others survived, but Groot perished in the crash. A devastated Rocket managed to recover a twig from Groot's remains, recalling of what he had said about telling him that he was an idiot.
