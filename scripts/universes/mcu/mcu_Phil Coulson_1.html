Phillip J. "Phil" Coulson was a highly decorated agent and, for a period of time, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. He was Nick Fury's right-hand man for many important missions and his liaison to the Avengers. He served as the primary operative in the Avengers Initiative following a Skrull Invasion of Earth in the 1990s, that led to the surfacing of Captain Marvel. Coulson later ran ground interference, surveillance and tactical operations in Puente Antiguo, New Mexico as part of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s investigation surrounding an incident with Thor and the Destroyer. He was also the primary S.H.I.E.L.D. operative in the investigation into Stark Industries.

During the Attack on the Helicarrier, Coulson was killed by Loki. His death gave the Avengers the push they needed to band together and stop the Chitauri invasion. On Fury's orders, Coulson was brought to the Guest House, a secret facility where he was brought back to life using treatments developed by Project T.A.H.I.T.I., which Coulson had formerly presided over. To preserve his sanity after his resurrection, all memories of these events were removed from his mind.

Coulson returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. to lead a new team to investigate the cases S.H.I.E.L.D. had not yet classified. While on this team, Coulson discovered the truth about the events after his death. During the HYDRA Uprising, despite the dissolution of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the betrayal of Grant Ward, he led his team against the forces of HYDRA. He then led the charge in the final battle against John Garrett, in which Garrett was ultimately defeated. After the battle, Nick Fury appointed him the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., ordering him to rebuild the organization from the ground up.

As director, Coulson led the new S.H.I.E.L.D. in many battles against HYDRA, crippling that terrorist organization. He made some contacts with the United States Air Force via Glenn Talbot. However, he became a fugitive when another faction of S.H.I.E.L.D., led by Robert Gonzales, attacked and occupied his base. Accompanied by only a few loyal friends, Coulson started a battle to reclaim S.H.I.E.L.D. He eventually made a deal with Gonzales, and they worked together against HYDRA, finally reunifying the two factions into one organization with Coulson as its rightful director. A new threat soon arose, the Inhumans led by Jiaying. In the ensuing conflict, both S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Inhumans suffered casualties. Coulson himself paid a high price to achieve victory, having his left hand cut off. Coulson was resilient. He started a new project that would ensure the safety of humanity.

The mission of recruiting Inhumans for his team became difficult, as the Advanced Threat Containment Unit, led by Rosalind Price, was also going after the new Inhumans. Coulson developed a relationship with Price while facing threats from Ward's new version of HYDRA, from Lash and from the Inhumans. After Ward killed Price, Coulson followed him to the planet Maveth and killed Ward to avenge all the people he had murdered. Believing that Gideon Malick was the last remaining leader of HYDRA, Coulson discovered that the Hive had returned to Earth from Maveth, using Ward's body as host. With Malick's death, Coulson felt responsible for the new threat. He fought to prevent Hive from accomplishing his plan to change all humans to Inhumans and make them part of Hive. After Lincoln Campbell sacrificed himself to kill Hive and save humanity, the directorship of S.H.I.E.L.D. passed to Jeffrey Mace, while Coulson and Alphonso Mackenzie went in pursuit of the former agent turned vigilante, Daisy Johnson.

With the revelation of Lucy Bauer's ambition to find the Darkhold, Coulson created an alliance with Johnson and Ghost Rider to find the book before Bauer did. He was caught in an explosion with Ghost Rider and Leo Fitz, caused by Eli Morrow, and was temporarily trapped in another dimension. He returned with the help of Holden Radcliffe and his Life-Model Decoy assistant, Aida. Coulson then led the last fight against Morrow. Following the revelation that Mace was not actually an Inhuman, Coulson assumed the position of de facto Director while Mace remained de jure Director. Under Coulson's directorship, S.H.I.E.L.D. continued fighting the anti-Inhuman hate group known as the Watchdogs, led by Anton Ivanov, who targeted Coulson. Holden Radcliffe kidnapped Coulson, replaced him with an LMD, and plugged him into the Framework, where Coulson lived as a history teacher. With the help of Daisy Johnson and Jemma Simmons, Coulson escaped the Framework, only to face off against Aida's threat in the real world.

Coulson killed Aida by temporarily bonding with the Spirit of Vengeance and afterward was sent to the year 2091, along with other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. The team discovered that Earth had been destroyed, and the surviving humans were enslaved by the Kree. He and the other agents eventually returned to the present day, although Coulson revealed that he was dying from his old injury, due to his deal with the Spirit of Vengeance. In order to learn more about the destruction of Earth, Coulson was imprisoned by Hale, who not only revealed that HYDRA still existed under her leadership, but also that there was an impending alien invasion. Following his escape from Hale, S.H.I.E.L.D. entered into a conflict with the Confederacy. As Coulson was trying to negotiate with the Confederacy, Glenn Talbot attempted to become a savior but instead became bent on becoming more powerful. Coulson, despite knowing that this meant sacrificing himself, aided in defeating Talbot in the Battle of Chicago and stopped him from amassing the planet's Gravitonium, successfully averting the destruction of Earth. Accepting his impending death, Coulson retired from S.H.I.E.L.D. and lived out his remaining days in Tahiti with Melinda May, eventually succumbing to his illness.

Biography
Early Life
Recruited by Nick Fury
The son of Robert and Julie Coulson, Phil, was born in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, on July 8, 1964. An only child, he wished that he had siblings, idealizing what kind of relationship he would have with a younger brother. The Coulson family identified as Catholic, but they would only attend Mass on Christmas and Easter. Coulson grew up to be a huge fan of Peggy Carter and Captain America, acquiring a vintage Captain America Card Collection over the course of two years. He played baseball in the Little League and had a batting average over .400.

His father introduced him to working on cars, and together they worked on a red Corvette that Coulson kept his whole life. Coulson lost his father at a very young age, and his mother passed away later on. After high school, while in college studying history and learning how S.H.I.E.L.D. had shaped the times, Coulson was recruited  to S.H.I.E.L.D., where he studied at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy of Communications. While at the Academy, Coulson learned about and became an expert in S.H.I.E.L.D. history, appreciating the legends and historical figures he learned about, especially Daniel Sousa, the first fallen S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. After graduating from the Academy, Coulson became a special agent and was taught by Nick Fury alongside John Garrett.

Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
First Actions
Coulson's first mission was with Melinda May. He was sent on a retrieval operation to a coffee shop in Sausalito. The mission did not have an exit strategy and resulted in May spending five hours in the bay until Coulson fished her out. Over the years, Coulson and May developed a strong friendship. During their time together, the two often spoke about being able to pick their own missions and call their own shots. During one of their very first missions together, Coulson allowed May to drive Lola, making her vow to never tell anybody about it. During the 1990s, Coulson was also partnered with Katherine Shane for a few operations.

Skrull Invasion
Coulson investigating a mysterious woman
In 1995, Coulson accompanied Nick Fury and a S.H.I.E.L.D. team led by Director Keller to investigate a call about a mysterious woman crash landing in a Blockbuster Video store in Los Angeles. Coulson met with the Los Angeles Police Department security officer who had made the call. The officer told Coulson that the woman was making a call at a nearby phone booth. Coulson was tasked with inspecting the Blockbuster, searching for anything of interest at the crash site.

Coulson realizes he's abandoned at the site
When Coulson was done, he exited the store and discovered that everyone had left. He was unaware that a Skrull had taken Coulson's form and was driving with Fury. When he asked Fury over the phone why he had left him at the Blockbuster, Coulson overheard the scuffle between Fury and the Skrull and the crash as Fury caused an accident which killed the Skrull.

Chase of Captain Marvel
Coulson unknowingly helps Talos
Coulson then regrouped with S.H.I.E.L.D., where he saw Nick Fury and handed him the police report from the recent incident. Because he thought Fury had much to teach him, Coulson asked Fury if he needed a partner. Fury shut him down at that moment, because Coulson's presence reminded him of the Skrull impostor that had tried to kill him earlier. Coulson assisted Talos, who was impersonating Keller, as he struggled to get into Keller's office. Coulson scanned his ID card to help him, unaware that the real Keller had been knocked out.

Coulson choosing to let Nick Fury escape
Coulson was later part of a team led by the Keller imposter to bring in Fury, who was working with the mysterious woman, Vers, at Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility. As Coulson and Whitcher made their way through the facility, Coulson was informed of the order to bring in Fury dead or alive. When Fury and Vers tried to escape, Coulson discovered them and held them at gunpoint, before trusting his instinct to let them escape. Coulson aided their getaway by telling his team that they had gone a different direction.

Debrief with Nick Fury
Coulson discusses finding more heroes
Nick Fury returned from assisting in the fight between the Kree and Skrulls, having lost his left eye. Coulson went to his office and returned with a variety of prosthetic eyes, as well as some files on Carol Danvers. He expressed concern over the Tesseract's location and Fury insisted it would turn up. Coulson didn't know it was inside Goose. Fury then told Coulson that, with Danvers preoccupied on the other side of the universe, he felt the need for an initiative to protect the Earth from intergalactic threats. Coulson assumed S.H.I.E.L.D. needed to find more weapons, but Fury clarified they needed heroes. Coulson then wished Fury well on his recovery before leaving.

The Russian 0-8-4
Coulson arrives in Russia to retrieve the 0-8-4
Coulson was tasked by S.H.I.E.L.D. to retrieve an unknown object classed as an 0-8-4 from the Burkov Mining Facility in Russia. Upon arrival, Coulson impersonated an agent of the United Nations in order to access the site and retrieve the object. Coulson and May entered a deserted building, where they found a locked safe. Coulson intended to crack the safe, but May signaled the presence of four SVR agents, prompting them to switch roles: May would open the safe while Coulson tried to convince the SVR agents that his mission was well-grounded.

Coulson and Melinda May attempt to access a vault
Coulson did his best to persuade the SVR, whose leader informed him that they had also been sent to retrieve the mysterious artifact. May eventually broke into the safe and stole the object. The SVR agents arrived and searched for her, but she had escaped with Coulson's SUV, leaving him behind. The SVR soldiers mocked Coulson for being abandoned by his partner. They put a hood on him and took him away in their van for interrogation.

Coulson is held at gunpoint by SVR soldiers
May later returned to save him. She smashed Coulson's SUV into the SVR van. The SVR soldiers got out and tried to capture her, but May incapacitated them and released Coulson. The two S.H.I.E.L.D. agents flirted as they left the facility, taking the 0-8-4 with them. As a result of Coulson's escape, three of the SVR soldiers were executed. Anton Ivanov was the only survivor of the executions, and he vowed vengeance against Coulson.

Making Connections
In 2002, Coulson was sent to Cusco, Peru. During the mission, he met and befriended Camilla Reyes, an officer of the Policia Militar del Perú.

Coulson also recruited Akela Amador into S.H.I.E.L.D. While Amador was not a team player and did not see the value of teamwork, Coulson felt he could instill those qualities in her. In 2006, Amador led a raid into one of the gulags run by the notorious criminal Vanchat. The mission had a disastrous outcome. Fearing the worst, Coulson sent a second team to verify the loss of Amador's team. The second team found carnage but no evidence that Amador was one of the victims, leading Coulson to believe she was still alive. Coulson followed up on rumors that Amador was being held in Shanxi Province, but she had already been moved by her captors by the time he arrived.

Rescue in Bahrain
Coulson and his colleagues in Bahrain
In 2008, Coulson and May joined a S.H.I.E.L.D. TAC team on an Index Asset Evaluation and Intake mission in Manama, Bahrain. They were searching for Eva Belyakov, believed to possess super strength. Coulson attempted to approach Belyakov peacefully but she became hostile and she and a group of gangsters took O'Brien and a young girl hostage. Coulson called O'Brien's phone to negotiate, but heard O'Brien say, "Leave us alone." Hart subsequently led the TAC team to deal with the threat, but they lost communications as soon as they entered the building. Coulson tried calling S.H.I.E.L.D. for reinforcements but was met with red tape.

Coulson comforts Melinda May
With the Bahraini military approaching, Coulson decided to send May in alone, while he stalled the Bahrainis by claiming there was a biological weapon inside. They later heard a gunshot. Coulson and the Bahrainis stormed the building and found Eva and the gangsters dead, the S.H.I.E.L.D. team unharmed, and May cradling the body of the girl. Hart and his men had no memory of what happened. They assumed May fought through thirty men to save them, nicknaming her "The Cavalry". Coulson comforted May over her failure to save the child and encouraged her to let the girl go. The incident traumatized May so greatly that she resigned from fieldwork and took a position in the administrative division of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Avengers Initiative
When Nick Fury encountered Bruce Banner in a bar and saw him transform into Hulk, he called a meeting for some of his S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives. He told the operatives he was embarrassed at how poorly the mission had gone. Coulson told Fury that he and the others would be better prepared the next time Hulk attacked. Fury explained that since Banner was not a super soldier, S.H.I.E.L.D. would consider him a secondary issue and Thaddeus Ross would be allowed to deal with him.

Kidnapping of Tony Stark
Tony Stark was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan. Coulson and Nick Fury feared that Stark, not being a trained soldier, would tell his captors everything he knew about American national security, since he was involved in making weapons for the United States Armed Forces. Coulson offered to go in search of Stark, but Fury stopped him, saying that S.H.I.E.L.D. was not authorized to operate in Afghanistan. Fury instead sent Coulson to Obadiah Stane, to learn if Stark was a man who would sell his country to save his own skin.

When he arrived at the Stark Industries Headquarters, Stane told Coulson that Stark could not tell the Ten Rings much about the American defense systems. After returning to Fury, Coulson again offered to search for Stark. Fury once more turned him down.

Chasing Tony Stark
Three months later, Tony Stark was found by the United States Air Force in the desert. Nick Fury did not believe Stark's story that the terrorists' ammo dump had accidentally exploded. Fury thought that Stark had been recruited by the Ten Rings and sent home, where he had all the necessary equipment to make more weapons for them.

Coulson tries to arrange a meeting with Tony Stark about S.H.I.E.L.D.
Coulson went to a press conference hosted by Stark. He came across Pepper Potts, explaining that he was sent by S.H.I.E.L.D. to interview Stark about his experience with the Ten Rings. Potts promised to pencil him in for a meeting later in the month. She also advised him to shorten the name of his organization, as it was too long to remember.

Months later, the agency's satellites detected something that appeared to be an unmanned aerial vehicle. When Fury and Coulson saw the footage of its flight through the streets of Los Angeles, they realized the "vehicle" was actually Stark in a flying armored suit. To be sure, they hacked Stark's computers and found confirmation that Stark was developing the armored suit.

Meeting Tony Stark
Coulson and Tony Stark talk for the first time
Upon meeting Tony Stark at the Third Annual Firefighters' Fund gala, Coulson informed Stark of his allegiance with S.H.I.E.L.D. Stark claimed he was too busy to talk with Coulson, but he agreed to a meeting at another time.

Coulson is informed of Obadiah Stane's treachery
A few days later, both Coulson and Nick Fury were in Afghanistan, where they visited the village of Gulmira. When an agent found an abandoned camera, they saw footage of Stark in a repainted armor attacking the Ten Rings and destroying their piles of weapons. Back at S.H.I.E.L.D. Headquarters, Coulson and Fury saw that Stark was being chased by two F-22 Raptors. When one plane went down and Stark risked his life to save the pilot, Fury realized that he was wrong about Stark. He then ordered Coulson to check Obadiah Stane's activities with Stark's finances.

Coulson and other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Obadiah Stane
Coulson went to Stark Industries Headquarters, where he encountered Pepper Potts. She informed Coulson that Stane was involved in Stark's kidnapping and attempted murder. Coulson and four other agents tried to arrest Stane, but their efforts were thwarted by Stane who was now wearing his own armor. However, in the ensuing battle, Stark defeated Stane.

Coulson with Pepper Potts and Tony Stark
Stark and James Rhodes were then taken to a secret base where they encountered Agent Coulson. Coulson told them that Stark's fight against Stane had been good, but that he needed to learn how to become a real fighter, and that his colleagues would teach him.

"I Am Iron Man"
Coulson speaks with Pepper Potts
When Coulson returned to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Headquarters, he and Nick Fury watched the press conference. Coulson asked for Fury's opinion on Stark's possible future work with S.H.I.E.L.D., and Fury liked the acronym so much that he decided to make it official. A few seconds later, both Coulson and Fury were shocked when Stark publicly revealed that he was Iron Man.

New Tasks
Nick Fury assigned Coulson to recruit Mr. Hendricks to S.H.I.E.L.D. He took Hendricks through a practice mission in which Coulson pretended to die, and afterward, offered Hendricks his evaluation on his performance. Later, after Tony Stark rejected the offer to join the Avengers Initiative, S.H.I.E.L.D. started to keep tabs on him. After observing Stark rescue a pilot from an enemy area without collateral damage, Coulson wondered if Stark had finally learned how to play a role in S.H.I.E.L.D. He asked Fury for his opinion, and Fury told him not to mistake Stark's actions for any kind of newfound maturity, and said they would keep watching him.

Project T.A.H.I.T.I.
Coulson and Goodman discuss their Project
In coordination with the Avengers Initiative, Nick Fury started Project T.A.H.I.T.I. and appointed Coulson its director. The goal of the project was to create a medicine that could save a mortally wounded Avenger. Located within the Guest House, the scientists assigned to the project used the blood from a decaying alien corpse to create a powerful drug. They called the drug GH.325, and it was capable of repairing injured tissue and curing deadly diseases.

Coulson chose six agents who were dying of terminal illnesses as test subjects. At first, the patients responded positively, but they soon started speaking gibberish and writing strange symbols on anything they could, including their own bodies. Coulson, after seeing the extreme side effects, resigned from his position, recommending the project be shutdown and that the alien corpse be destroyed. He also had the patients' memories replaced and gave them new identities, so they would have a chance at a normal life.

A Busy Week
Greenland
A few months later, Coulson and Nick Fury led an expedition to Greenland in hopes of finding Steve Rogers, who had been classified as MIA after World War II. They did not find Rogers, but instead found one of the disabled flying bombs from HYDRA's ship, the Valkyrie. The World Security Council eventually ordered S.H.I.E.L.D. to shut down the operation and focus on Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S.. Ignoring the direct order, Fury decided to continue with his usual activities, and he told Coulson to do the same.

Watching Over Tony Stark
Coulson in Tony Stark's workshop
At his birthday party, Tony Stark got drunk and had a battle with James Rhodes. So Nick Fury put Coulson in charge of guarding Stark, making sure Stark did not leave his house while he looked for a cure for his Palladium poisoning. Later, Coulson went to Stark's workshop and found one of the early prototypes of Captain America's shield in Howard Stark's casket. Tony Stark took the shield and used it to balance the Particle Accelerator he was building.

Coulson informed Fury about the appearance of a wormhole over New Mexico. Coulson had spent the week trying to warn Fury that the wormhole was a possibility. Fury had Coulson lead an expedition to New Mexico. Coulson contacted Natasha Romanoff and asked her to handle things at Stark's house.

Finding Mjølnir
Coulson intervening with an ongoing robbery
On the way to New Mexico, Coulson stopped at a Roxxon service station to buy snacks and fill his car with gas. While he was in the shop, two robbers entered and threatened the clerk with shotguns. Coulson intervened, passing them his car keys and showing them his gun. While handing over the gun, pretending to be compliant, he quickly rendered both of them unconscious. He returned to the counter and bought two snacks, paid, told the clerk to keep the change and to tell the police that she was the one who defeated the gunmen.

Coulson discovers Thor's hammer
Upon arriving in the desert of New Mexico, Coulson and his team discovered the crater site with the mysterious hammer at the center. They labeled the object an 0-8-4 and called in a team to analyze it. Though the locals had discovered the hammer before Coulson's team, no one had been able to lift or move it, not even with the help of their vehicles. Coulson and his men set up a perimeter and a base of operations surrounding the crater. Coulson also consulted with Elliot Randolph, since S.H.I.E.L.D. determined a link between the hammer and Norse mythology.

Meeting "Donald Blake"
Agent Coulson takes control of the crater
Coulson was sent to confiscate all of the research about the mysterious wormhole that Jane Foster and her scientific team had collected. Coulson and his agents traveled to Puente Antiguo and confiscated all the scientists' equipment, despite Foster's protests. That same night, an unknown man infiltrated Coulson's base and single-handedly took out a dozen S.H.I.E.L.D. agents using various fighting styles. Coulson observed from a distance, asking Clint Barton to prepare to take action against the intruder if necessary. When the attacker tried and failed to lift the hammer, a group of agents easily captured him.

Coulson interrogates the mysterious intruder
Shortly after, Coulson interrogated the stranger about his identity and training, believing him to be a warrior of some type. The stranger refused to answer questions. The interrogation was interrupted when Erik Selvig arrived and informed Coulson that the stranger was Donald Blake, a member of his scientific staff. An agent confirmed Selving's story by running a background check in the computer database and finding a falsified document created by Foster. Though Coulson knew that Selvig was lying, he agreed to free "Blake," secretly assigning agents to follow Selvig and his friend.

Attacked by the Destroyer
Coulson witnesses the Destroyer's arrival
A few days later, Jasper Sitwell discovered the coordinates of another potential crater site that appeared to have an exact signature match to the hammer. Upon investigation, Coulson and a unit of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents found a gigantic automaton of unknown origin. As the automaton slowly approached, Sitwell asked Coulson if the automaton was one of Tony Stark's inventions. Coulson replied that Stark had never said anything to him about it. Coulson then tried to speak with the automaton, but the iron giant attacked them.

Coulson with Thor
Coulson survived the attack. When the automaton attacked Puente Antiguo, Coulson saw "Donald Blake" gaining mysterious supernatural powers. When "Blake" summoned the hammer and defeated the automaton, Coulson realized that he was actually Thor, the Norse God of Thunder and Prince of Asgard. Coulson confronted Thor, who offered his services in protecting Earth under the sole condition that Coulson return all of Foster's research and material. Coulson agreed to Thor's terms and requested that they be debriefed just before Thor flew upwards with Foster in his arms. Later, Coulson and Clint Barton supervised the transport of the automaton to a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.

New Missions
The Big Problem
Coulson with Jasper Sitwell
Coulson met with Jasper Sitwell in a cafe to discuss the news that The World Security Council had ordered S.H.I.E.L.D. to recruit Emil Blonsky for the Avengers Initiative. Sitwell and Coulson disapproved. Coulson explained that the Council considered Blonsky a war hero and was pinning an incident in Harlem on Bruce Banner, though it was started by Blonsky after he transformed into the Abomination. After ensuring that Sitwell had the proper Clearance Level, he explained that Blonsky was not in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.

Coulson and Jasper Sitwell met up again
Coulson and Sitwell agreed that releasing Blonsky from the Army's custody and adding him to the Avengers Initiative roster would be foolish. Because they were compelled by the WSC order, they decided to send someone to talk to General Ross who would be so irritating that Ross would simply refuse to free Blonsky. Not without reservations, Coulson decided to send Tony Stark. A few days later, Coulson and Sitwell met at the same cafe. Their plan had worked, as Stark's annoying behavior made Ross so angry that he refused to free Blonsky.

Russia
Sometime later, Natasha Romanoff was sent to Moscow to interrogate Mikhail Fjodorov, with Coulson in charge of the mission. After Fjodorov was killed, Romanoff cut off contact with S.H.I.E.L.D. and started chasing Sofia, who wanted to kill Romanoff and become the new Black Widow.

Coulson followed Chuzhoi and Rogusskii, who had been sent by Starodoub to kill Romanoff. Two of Coulson's agents were killed by Sofia, and Coulson arrived just in time to save Romanoff's life. He gave her the necessary equipment to infiltrate Yuri Klementiev's yacht, where she met Sofia again, an encounter which cost Gennady Markov his life.

After Coulson discovered Sofia's employer was the billionaire Richard Frampton, Natasha went and infiltrated his headquarters in Vladivostok. She learned that Frampton worked for the Ten Rings terrorist organization and that he had made a Jericho missile they intended to explode near the border between Russia and North Korea, destabilizing the peace. Romanoff destroyed the missile, and Coulson led a team of agents to the launch area, where they captured all surviving members of the Ten Rings.

Finding Captain America
A year after the Battle of Puente Antiguo, a group of scientists successfully reactivated the giant automaton that attacked the city. When Coulson saw this, he told the chief scientist to make the automaton a hundred times smaller and put a trigger on it. The resulting weapon was the Destroyer Armor Prototype Gun, and it marked the beginning of Phase 2 of the Tesseract project. 

A few minutes later, Coulson was called by Nick Fury, who informed him that Steve Rogers had finally been found. When Coulson arrived at the place he had been found, he saw his colleagues excavating Rogers' completely frozen, but still living, body from the wreck of HYDRA's giant plane, the Valkyrie. However, there was no time for celebrating, as Fury immediately sent Coulson on another mission.

Chitauri Invasion
Loki's Attack
Coulson at Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. base
Coulson was at the Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility when the Tesseract began behaving strangely. Nick Fury and Maria Hill were called in and, upon arrival, were met by Phil Coulson. 

Coulson updates Nick Fury on the situation
Fury asked for an update on the situation and Coulson reported that he did not know what was happening. Fury ordered an evacuation of the facility, and Coulson took charge of moving the Phase 2 prototypes to a safe distance. When the Tesseract was activated and Loki arrived on Earth to launch an invasion, the facility started collapsing. Coulson ordered the agents to abandon the prototypes and save themselves. They all boarded a helicopter and flew away from the destroyed facility. Fury then ordered Coulson to return to base as their mission was a level seven and they were now at war.

Worried about the safety of Jane Foster, Coulson told a fellow agent to contact her and make her a lucrative job offer at a S.H.I.E.L.D. observatory in Tromsø, Norway, which she accepted.

Contacting the Black Widow
Coulson on the phone with Natasha Romanoff
With the Tesseract in the hands of a hostile demigod, Nick Fury decided to activate the Avengers Initiative and call to action a group of extraordinary people who could protect the planet better than S.H.I.E.L.D. The first candidate was Bruce Banner, but Fury needed Natasha Romanoff to convince Banner. Coulson called Romanoff on the phone, interrupting her interrogation. When Coulson told her that Clint Barton had gone rogue, Romanoff easily defeated Georgi Luchkov and his subordinates. While Coulson went to recruit Tony Stark, Romanoff traveled to Kolkata, India where she found Banner and convinced him to join S.H.I.E.L.D.

Visiting Tony Stark
Coulson meets Tony Stark in Stark Tower
Coulson attempted to contact Tony Stark, but Stark refused to answer his calls, forcing Coulson to override J.A.R.V.I.S.'s security protocols and visit Stark in person at Stark Tower. Coulson interrupted Stark's dinner with Pepper Potts and informed Stark that he was needed for the Avengers Initiative. Stark was reluctant to join, until Coulson gave him all the data about the Initiative and the Tesseract. Stark grudgingly agreed. Coulson then drove Potts to the airport while they discussed Audrey Nathan.

Meeting Captain America
Coulson meets Captain America
Coulson's next assignment was to escort Steve Rogers to the Helicarrier. Rogers had joined the Avengers Initiative upon Fury's invitation. Aboard the Quinjet, Coulson asked Rogers to sign his vintage Captain America Card Collection, which he had gathered over two years. Coulson was awed by Rogers and revealed that Captain America had been a role model to him.
