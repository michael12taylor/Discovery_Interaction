<html><p>His rage and hatred for Ronan the Accuser often made him highly impatient with his new teammates when he did not see that they could beat Ronan. This made him act without thinking of the consequences, such as getting Ronan to come to Knowhere in order to fight him, which lead to Ronan obtaining the Orb, nearly destroying his friends, and eventually lead to the Battle of Xandar and near destruction of the planet at Ronan's hands. He felt great remorse towards his rashness and selfishly endangering others for his own vengeance, prompting him to work better with his team. However, his vengefulness then made him want to kill Thanos when he rationalized that Ronan was only a puppet. His wrath, as well as his calm demeanor, also hide his sadness and grief over his family, though Mantis was able to sense and experience it and was driven to tears while Drax remained outwardly unfazed, only showing some somberness.

Despite his calm nature in most situations, Drax's unending hatred for Thanos remains as strong as ever even four years after swearing to kill him and finding solace with the Guardians. Upon encountering an illusion of the Mad Titan on Knowhere, his serenity dissipates to the point where he seethes with rage and had to be restrained by Quill and Mantis before he attempted to kill him. Nevertheless, Drax does not associate his hatred with anything related to Thanos such as his daughters in contrast to the Drax that was willing to kill Gamora in the Kyln just to hurt Ronan. When he grabbed Gamora in Knowhere, Drax screamed at Thanos to let her go and bravely charged at him with only two knives despite him being equipped with three of Infinity Stones at the time. Drax later screamed at Thanos upon arriving on Titan, immediately throwing his knife at him without any care that it may not be Thanos or his minion, but someone else and later on unhesitatingly and ferociously fought the Titan alongside Doctor Strange. Drax was also in disbelief that Mantis claims Thanos was in mourning on Titan due to his strong belief that he was a monster with no redeeming qualities, which proved to be not entirely correct, as Thanos does have the same (though much more twisted) love for Gamora that Drax felt for his own daughter.

Though his warrior mentality caused him to appear brooding and serious, Drax expressed an immature and childish excitement for battle and adventure and was often thrilled when faced with dangerous and tense situations. As such, he was laughing jovially when fighting guards at the Kyln and when crashing into the Dark Aster with his team. Drax has an uncanny affinity for knives, making them his weapon of choice in most situations, regardless of the size and type of foes he fought unless forced otherwise. It was so well-known that Moloka Dar attempted to appease him by offering Drax his own. Despite this, he was willing to use other weapons, such as the Hadron Enforcer.

Although Drax has grown fond of his teammates, his social skills leave much to be desired as he called Gamora a "green whore" when telling her she is his friend along with the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Ironically, he will not hesitate to harm or even kill anyone who insults his friends, as he blasted Nebula with a rocket launcher as she was insulting Gamora, before calmly stating no one could speak to his friends in such a manner. Though unlikely to admit being so, he was shown time and again to have a soft side to him, enough to comfort his friend, Rocket Raccoon, when the latter seemingly lost his friend, Groot.

After the battle with Ronan, Drax attempted to learn more about living as a modern citizen to avoid getting into any more trouble with the law since his records have been expunged. He, in turn, experienced trouble understanding this concept, he asked if he could rip out a man's spine if he annoys him, which Rhomann Dey reminded him was murder, and therefore, illegal.

For Drax, his exploits with the Guardians of the Galaxy have been a journey of renewal. The trauma he suffered after losing his family was so severe that he lost himself to rage and revenge. Yet the new family Drax has found has provided him some peace and allowed him to reconcile the loss of his wife and daughter. In the Guardians, Drax finds an adopted family that share similar experiences of loss and hardship. In particular, Drax finds a daughter figure in Mantis, whom he sees as sharing the same innocence that his daughter once had.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Kylosian Physiology: As a Kylosian, Drax possesses superhuman attributes, such as his strength and impact-resistant skin. Despite his towering height and broad frame, he is very athletic.
Superhuman Strength: Drax has much more physical prowess than most species, being able to lift the bulk weight, break through stone and metal with ease, and rip machines in half with his bare hands. Using his brute strength alone, ripped off pieces of Groot, and pulled out Korath's cybernetic implant from his head. His strength has allowed him to overpower many enemies and toss them aside, to the point where he could easily restrain Gamora with one hand, brawl with Groot and effortlessly take out most of Ronan's forces. While escaping prison, Drax was capable of easily ripping a Kyln security drone in half. He was also able to match and eventually overpower the cybernetically augmented Kree Korath the Pursuer. The strength of Drax also extends to his legs, allowing him to jump great heights at a single leap; he was able to catch a drone several feet off the ground with a single leap, and also was able to jump several meters to attack Ronan the Accuser and later did the same to begin his battle with Thanos. Despite his incredible strength, Drax was easily beaten half to death by Ronan, although he could still fight against him for a time, and was effortlessly overpowered by Thanos, who had no problem parrying Drax's knife attacks and knocking him out with a single punch that Drax could not deflect even with his knives, although he managed to injure Thanos slightly on the leg using his knives when he had him off-guard as well as with aid from Doctor Strange's Eldritch Whips, Spider-Man's web, and Star-Lord's shock device fired from his blaster, Drax even managed to restrain Thanos long enough for Mantis to briefly subdue him so Iron Man and Spider-Man may attempt to pull the Infinity Gauntlet from his left arm. Drax can also throw his knives with immense force, enough to pierce Doctor Strange's twin Tao Mandalas. Drax is able to jump with great speed and height. He jumped many feet into an Abilisk's mouth. He was later able to jump at Thanos to successfully strike him with his knives, and easily leap onto Cull Obsidian's back.
Superhuman Durability: Drax can withstand attacks that most species cannot. Drax has withstood a beating from Ronan the Accuser, who sent Drax flying several dozen feet through a metal wall. Also in the Guardians' battle with Ronan aboard the Dark Aster, Drax was able to survive the impact of Rocket's M-Ship crashing into him, although he was knocked unconscious, and sustained no injuries when he was set on fire and flung against several trees as the Milano crashed onto Berhert while he was tethered to the outside of the ship. Drax had even survived being smashed to the ground when the Abilisk's tentacles grabbed him. Drax's skin is much denser than average and is thus impact resistant and difficult to be cut with bladed and piercing weapons. Due to this, Drax was able to withstand being pierced by a Yaka Arrow by Kraglin Obfonteri. He also could easily survive falls from great heights and land on his feet. Drax was even able to withstand a powerful blow from Thanos himself, which knocked him through stones, and then was able to withstand being hurled off Thanos and quickly recover to attempt to battle him again alongside Nebula and Quill, surviving a powerful shockwave from the Power Stone, although it knocked him out for a while. However, Drax has his limits, as both Mantis and Doctor Strange doubted he could withstand a point-blank blast to his face from Iron Man's nanotech suit.
Enhanced Agility: Drax has a higher level of agility than most others. Drax is able to precisely take down enemies, such as leaping onto a Kyln guards shoulder to kick a guard behind him and leap onto Cull Obsidian.
Regenerative Healing Factor: Drax's cells regenerate much faster than most species. During his fight with Ronan, Drax suffered several bruises and cuts on his face; however, when he was removed from the yellow liquid tank, he was completely healed. In particular, Drax's skin cells have a drastically higher regenerative rate than his other cells, allowing him to recover from superficial and light wounds faster.

Abilities
Drax killing a couple of Sakaaran soldiers
Expert Combatant: Drax has proven to be a brutal, yet accomplished combatant, able to overpower multiple opponents, including several Kyln guards and Sakaaran warriors with little effort. Drax was also capable of fighting equally with the highly trained and cybernetically enhanced Kree Korath the Pursuer, eventually managing to kill him. However, Drax was easily outmatched by Ronan the Accuser despite lasting better than most against the Kree General and despite engaging him with Doctor Strange, was swiftly beaten by Thanos, who effortlessly knocked him out with a single blow before he overwhelmed Strange, too.
Knife Mastery: Drax is highly skilled in using knives, particularly his own dual knives, that he used to take down many Sakaaran soldiers and even land a strike on Thanos and fight against the Titan alongside Strange using a sword made of Eldritch Magic, although only briefly. He can also skillfully throw his knives.
Expert Marksman: Using the blaster, Drax was able to accurately shoot down Zylak's Omnicraft mid-flight. Drax can also accurately throw his dual knives, as he almost hit Doctor Strange if not for his Tao Mandalas.
Equipment
Weapons
Drax the Destroyer wielding his Dual Knives
Dual Knives: Drax's weapons of choice are two knives which he often takes into battle. Due to his main knives being taken away by the Kyln guards, Drax briefly used Moloka Dar's knives until he got his own back. He then used the knives to battle Ronan the Accuser during the Skirmish on Knowhere as well as fighting against the Sakaarans during the Battle of Xandar, using them for both close-quarters combat as well as using them as throwing knives. He continued to use them alongside the Guardians, notably when he attempted to stab the Abilisk to death, but to no avail. Drax armed himself with his knives when he prepared to confront Thanos on Knowhere, but he was quickly stopped in his tracks when Thanos altered his biology with the Reality Stone. He used the knives as a part of Quill's plan to incapacitate Thanos on Titan, slashing his legs with them. Though he disappeared from the Snap, Drax kept his knives after the Blip and used them to stab Cull Obsidian during the Battle of Earth.
Drax holding the Hadron Enforcer
Hadron Enforcer: Drax used the Hadron Enforcer, invented by Rocket Raccoon to intimidate the Ravagers into freeing both Star-Lord and Gamora from their custody, although they were freed before he could fire. Drax later used the weapon against Ronan the Accuser during the Battle of Xandar.
Power Stone: During their final battle with Ronan the Accuser, Drax and the other Guardians of the Galaxy used the Power Stone in tandem to direct the Stone's energy at Ronan, destroying his body and killing him.

Kyln: Drax was imprisoned in the Kyln for 22 counts of murder and five counts of grievous bodily harm. He approached Gamora shortly after she was incarcerated in an attempt to kill her for her affiliation with Ronan the Accuser and Thanos, but he was convinced by Star-Lord to spare her because she was no longer associated with them, as well as that he would have the opportunity to confront Ronan for himself. Drax later escaped alongside Star-Lord, Gamora, Groot and Rocket Raccoon after helping the latter two dispatch of the prison's security hoverbots.

Trivia
In the comics, Drax was a human named Arthur Douglas whose wife was killed by Thanos. His daughter, Heather Douglas, survived and was found by Thanos' father.
In the movie, it required Drax plus 3 of the other Guardians to control the power of the Orb for just a moment. However, in the comics, an incarnation of Drax managed to easily control the Power Gem by himself.
Drax's skin tone was changed from the bright green in the comics to a muddier grey, to avoid visual similarities to Hulk.
