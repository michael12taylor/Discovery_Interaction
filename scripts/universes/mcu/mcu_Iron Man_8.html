<html><p>Master Engineer: Stark was an extremely talented and prolific engineer and robotics technician, having been able to make many complicated inventions at a young age, building his first circuit board at age four and his first engine at age six and at some point of his childhood, built Dum-E and U., his personal lab assistants, and then going on to construct numerous innovative Stark Industries weapons for the US military as an adult, most notably the Jericho, as well as leading Stark Industries to become the largest tech conglomerate in the world. Even in a cave with very few resources, Stark and Ho Yinsen were able to make the Iron Man Mark I armor and the first miniature Arc Reactor. Indeed, Obadiah Stane's group of well-equipped scientists failed to replicate the miniaturized Arc Reactor, while multiple world governments similarly failed to replicate Stark's Iron Man armors with the Feebles. He was also able to later program his Iron Man armors to fly to his body and the bodies of others, eventually able to remotely control his armors from vast distances away, via telepresence headset. Stark was equally brilliant in software and holographic engineering, with his custom-built mansion being highly technology-integrated and wired to be run through his personal A.I. assistant, J.A.R.V.I.S., whom Stark created from scratch. Stark would later go on to create the back-up A.I. systems F.R.I.D.A.Y., J.O.C.A.S.T.A., T.A.D.A.S.H.I., and Karen, in addition to installing the Training Wheels Protocol into the Spider-Man Suit, as well as re-assembling and restoring the memory of J.A.R.V.I.S. after finding the AI's remnants in the NEXUS world Internet hub. Moreover, Stark was able to help Nick Fury improve turbines on S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarriers, as well as help Bruce Banner construct the Hulkbuster (capable of overpowering and knocking Hulk unconscious, despite the latter's great strength and durability), create the Ultron AI, and download J.A.R.V.I.S. into Vision android. Stark also equipped several of his fellow Avengers with upgraded weaponry, notably the electroshock batons of Black Widow, and a new uniform with electromagnetic panels for Captain America, to help the latter more easily retrieve his vibranium shield. Stark similarly equipped Spider-Man, upgrading his Web-Shooters, creating a new Spider-Man Suit, capable of focusing Peter's superhuman senses, in addition to also eventually creating the Iron Spider Armor for Parker. Even with limited resources and simple hardware store supplies, Stark was able to use them to build a home-made arsenal, with which he infiltrated the Mandarin's mansion. Indeed, Stark was even able to give a lecture on integrated circuits while drunk to the point that most other men, according to Ho Yinsen, wouldn't have been able to stand. Stark was even capable of creating a nano-tech version of the Infinity Gauntlet that while not quite equal in terms of durability to the original, was still sufficient to have allowed Hulk to undo the Snap.
Master Scientist: A exceptional scientific prodigy, Tony Stark was ingeniously resourceful, knowledgeable, and brilliant in many different fields of science, particularly physics, but also computer science, chemistry, and neuroscience, having graduated summa cum laude from MIT at age seventeen. Hence, he was able to attach an Arc Reactor to his chest in order to save his life, to synthesize a previously unknown element discovered by his father Howard Stark, to understand Erik Selvig's thermonuclear astrophysics notes on the Tesseract overnight, impressing S.H.I.E.L.D. deputy director, Maria Hill, and to modify Maya Hansen's Extremis formula. Stark, however, notably admitted to Bruce Banner surpassing him in the fields of radiophysics, particle collisions, and bio-organics, although at the same time, Bruce openly acknowledged Stark surpassed him in the field of physics, as in 2023, Stark proved capable of figuring out and creating the blueprints of a time-travel machine, something Bruce failed miserably at and a feat that genuinely surprised him.
Master Hacker: Stark was an extremely skilled hacker, as he had managed to crack the Pentagon's firewall on a dare, while still in high school. As an adult, Stark successfully used J.A.R.V.I.S. to hack into the S.H.I.E.L.D. database and learn of Phase 2, and, after successfully hacking into the NEXUS world Internet hub, Stark was able to discover J.A.R.V.I.S.' scattered remnants from all across the Internet.
Stark is honored by WIRED magazine
Master Businessman: At the age of twenty-one, Stark took over Stark Industries due to his parents' death, thereby becoming the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 Company in history. Since then, Stark helped the company grow, and gain more business partners, with Stark Industries eventually becoming the largest tech conglomerate in the world under his leadership. Stark was therefore extremely well-respected in the business world, able to command people's attention when he spoke on economic matters by virtue of the fact that he was savvy enough to have, over the years, built up Stark Industries into the premier weapons supplier to the US military for years. He was known for having his employees' loyalty, as well as his impeccable business ethics. However, upon his return, he strived to be environmentally responsible in his businesses such as turning away from making weapons. Nick Fury also notably recruited Stark as a business consultant for S.H.I.E.L.D., which continued until the fall of the agency in the HYDRA Uprising. Moreover, Stark and the US government would later go on to joint purchase the Department of Damage Control, which Stark spearheaded so effectively in all post-battle cleanup, that Toomes Salvage Company promptly went out of business.
Master Tactician: Stark, while a somewhat brash tactician, every so often made many split-second tactical decisions that either saved people's lives or overpowered his adversaries, though he usually had J.A.R.V.I.S.', and later F.R.I.D.A.Y.'s assistance in this. Notable instances of this include when Stark swiftly saved Gulmira from the Ten Rings, when he defeated Iron Monger with Pepper Potts' covert help, when he had War Machine use their combined repulsor blasts to defeat Whiplash, when he personally relocated a nuclear weapon sent by the World Security Council into outer space destroying the Chitauri Command Center effectively ending their invasion, when he managed to save all falling passengers of Air Force One, when he and War Machine saved Matthew Ellis and destroyed the Extremis Soldiers with the Iron Legion, when he used F.R.I.D.A.Y.'s combat analysis to gain the upper hand against Captain America, and also when he promptly saved and fused back together a sinking NYC ferry. In addition, when Spider-Man was uncertain what to do in the Avengers Civil War, Stark promptly reminded him of their discussed plan for him. Stark also used his mechanical ingenuity to rectify his mistakes of the past to prepare for the future by upgrading his armors, such as installing a parachute in Spider-Man's suit, a heater after crashing near Rose Hill as well as a GPS tracker after he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings, and developing a nanotechnology suit to avoid covert intrusion (after his suit was invaded by Ant-Man during the Clash of the Avengers), which contained larger cannons (after his Hulkbuster Repulsors were ineffective against Hulk during the Duel of Johannesburg), foot thrusters with greater speed, automatic aim-missiles, flight stabilizers (after his suit was rendered unstable for flight due to receiving a beatdown from the combined efforts of Captain America and Winter Soldier), and tools to assist in combat, such as battering rams, shields, and blades. Nonetheless, Stark's tactics were usually brash and lacked subtlety, as he mentioned to Captain America upon their first meeting that his plan of attack concerning Thor was simply to attack. However, Stark did learn from his mistakes, as he opted to take the Infinity Stones from the Nano Gauntlet rather than taking the gauntlet itself from Thanos, a course of action that had previously failed, and then decimating the Mad Titan's forces, ultimately outsmarting him in the end.
Stark blocks the Winter Soldier's attacks
Expert Combatant: Stark was trained in unarmed combat by Phil Coulson and Happy Hogan, and became quite formidable on his own without the Iron Man armor when the situation demanded it. Hence, he was able to hold his own against War Machine, a Lieutenant Colonel Air Force Combat Pilot, during their armored brawl, despite himself being drunk at the time, and ultimately losing the fight. He was also able to battle Thor almost to a standstill for a time while using the Mark VI armor, though only because Mj√∏lnir enhanced the armor to over 400% capacity and Thor was holding back. Stark further refined his hand-to-hand combat skills and became highly skilled in martial arts, being able to take down the guards at Aldrich Killian's Mansion with ease using a homemade arsenal, and defeat the Extremis Soldiers as well as hold his own reasonably well against Aldrich Killian on the Norco. He was also able to outfight and ultimately subdue the Scarlet Witch-controlled Hulk while wearing the Hulkbuster during their fierce duel and easily take out several Ultron Sentries in close combat. Although still outclassed by master level combatants; such as the Winter Soldier and Captain America, Stark proved capable of standing up to them by combining his fighting skills with his ingenuity, as shown by how he blinded Barnes before going up against him in hand-to-hand combat and managed to counter and disarm him of his gun and land a single punch but was quickly overpowered and knocked out due to being unarmored and while Stark was wearing his Mark XLVI armor, he was able to repeatedly overtake Winter Soldier and restrain him by using repulsors to enhance his speed and pin him down before he could react, although he got beaten in their last altercation and was able to briefly pummel Captain America using the same method and though ultimately pummeled by Rogers, upon using F.R.I.D.A.Y.'s combat analysis and his armor's repulsors combined, he was able to overwhelm Captain America briefly before inevitably being defeated. He was even capable of briefly standing up to Thanos, as he was able to block some of Thanos' attacks and land remarkable blows and get a grip on the Titan using the weapons and repulsors available to his nano-tech armor, but was ultimately severely outclassed, as he was near entirely unable to defend himself against Thanos' far superior fighting experience in a straight fist-fight and even armed with a sword, he was easily disarmed and stabbed.
Skilled Marksman: Although he usually used his armor, Stark proved to be a quite skilled marksman, as shown by how he easily wielded handguns skillfully to escape from A.I.M. operatives while not having access to his armor. When his armor's targeting systems were inconveniently compromised by Captain America, with solely his naked eye, Stark was able to precisely shoot at the hatch's pivot of the HYDRA Siberian Facility, successfully preventing Winter Soldier from escaping outside.
Iron Man demonstrates his flying abilities
Skilled Pilot: Stark demonstrated a strong understanding of aerodynamics and aircrafts, allowing him to perform complex maneuvers while flying in the Iron Man armor while being chased by F-22 Raptors. His aptitude also extended to ground-based vehicles, allowing him to efficiently drive in high-speed racing competitions such as the Monaco GP.
Multilingualism: Stark spoke his native English and some French, Spanish, Italian, Latin, and Dari.
Equipment
Weapons
SIG-Sauer P229R: Stark acquired this pistol during his infiltration of Aldrich Killian's mansion and used it to threaten Trevor Slattery until being disarmed and captured by Eric Savin. He later procured another one during his and Rhodes' raid on the Norco, only to discard the weapon after running out of ammo.
Kimber Custom: During his escape from Aldrich Killian's Mansion, Stark disarmed a guard of his gun and used it alongside his Mark XLII repulsor to threaten another guard into willingly surrendering.
MAC-10: Once equipping his Mark XLII repulsor and thruster to aid in his escape, Stark disarmed Ponytail Express of his weapon and used in tandem with his repulsor to neutralize the other guards attempting to kill him. However, his lack of trigger discipline and bad aim led him to just discard the gun after emptying the magazine.
Nuclear Missile: During the Battle of New York, Stark was informed by Nick Fury that a nuclear missile was about to hit the city. Stark intercepted the missile and flew it through the wormhole. He used it to destroy the Chitauri Command Center and end the battle.
Other Equipment
Bulletproof Vest: Stark had gone on his business trip to Afghanistan to demonstrate Stark Industries' new weapon, the Jericho Missile. As a precaution, he was wearing his Bulletproof Vest under his shirt. When his convoy was attacked, one of his own company's bombs landed beside him and had exploded, embedding several pieces of shrapnel in his chest despite the protection of the vest.

Trivia
In the comics, Tony Stark is a member of the Illuminati, a group made of the smartest and most powerful characters in the Marvel Universe, including Blackagar Boltagon, Stephen Strange, Bruce Banner, Medusa, Hank Pym, and T'Challa.
When Stark calls James Rhodes in Iron Man, Rhodes' ringtone is the original Iron Man theme song from the 1966 TV series.
Tony Stark's official net worth stands at $12.4 billion.
The reason why Stark's Arc Reactor changes from an inverted pyramid back to a circular shape in The Avengers is because Joss Whedon personally disliked it.
Starting with the Mark IV (with the sole exception of the Mark V), the armors no longer use the Arc Reactor within Stark's chest as a power source. Instead, the suits each have their own individual Arc Reactor as seen when Killian damaged the one powering the Silver Centurion armor and Stark's own Reactor remained unscathed.
Stark's de-aged appearance in Captain America: Civil War is based on Robert Downey, Jr.'s appearance in the 1987 film Less Than Zero.
Hawkeye mockingly calling Stark "The Futurist" is a reference to a studio album that Robert Downey, Jr. made in 2004.
Method Man mentions Iron Man in his song "Bulletproof Love" in the Luke Cage episode Soliloquy of Chaos.
Stark has his own flavor of Ben & Jerry's ice cream called Stark Raving Hazelnuts, which Doctor Strange states as being "a bit chalky."
Stark was 5'9 and weighed 185 lbs.
Archive footage of Tony Stark from Iron Man was used in the trailers of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.
Behind the Scenes
Robert Downey, Jr. was uncredited for his appearance in The Incredible Hulk.
Before Robert Downey, Jr. was cast as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Nicolas Cage, Tom Cruise, Leonardo DiCaprio, Timothy Olyphant and Hugh Jackman were interested in playing Iron Man. Cruise, in particular, was going to act in and produce the film. Cage played another Marvel superhero Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider in Ghost Rider. Hugh Jackman was originally offered the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man in Iron Man, but he turned it down in order to star in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, in the end Robert Downey, Jr. was cast instead. According to Jon Favreau, Clive Owen and Sam Rockwell are among the actors that were considered for Tony Stark during pre-production. Rockwell would appear in Iron Man 2 as Justin Hammer.
Favreau had planned to cast a newcomer in the role but ultimately chose Downey (a fan of the comic) because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part.
"The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye," the director explained. "He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark. Robert brings a depth that goes beyond a comic book character who is having trouble in high school, or can't get the girl." Favreau also felt Downey could make Stark a "likable asshole," but also depict an authentic emotional journey once he won over the audience. Downey had an office next to Favreau during pre-production, which allowed him greater involvement in the screenwriting process. He brought a deeper sense of humor to the film not present in previous drafts of the script.

Robert Downey, Jr. practices the "Wing Chun" martial arts style, which Tony Stark also demonstrates in-universe as seen on a training dummy in Iron Man 3 and in Stark's unarmored fight against The Winter Soldier in Captain America: Civil War.
Downey stated that he initially pushed Joss Whedon to make Stark the lead in The Avengers, "Well, I said, ‚ÄòI need to be in the opening sequence. I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.‚Äô He was like, ‚ÄòOkay, let‚Äôs try that.‚Äô We tried it, and it didn‚Äôt work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and, the theme are the theme, and everybody is just an arm of the octopus."
A biopic of Tony Stark starring Simon Williams
Throughout The Avengers, Stark is seen wearing a Black Sabbath t-shirt, a reference to the band's song "Iron Man". Despite the fact the song was created with no link to the Marvel comics, the Iron Man film series have often adapted the song to use in film and advertisements. However, in the novelization of the first film, Stark chooses the name himself rather than being given it by the press, naming his alter-ego after his favorite song.
Actor Simon Williams portrays Tony Stark in-universe. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 features a poster for a biopic of Stark, which is an obvious parody of the poster for the Danny Boyle film Steve Jobs starring Michael Fassbender in the title role.
Richard Cetrone, Greg Fitzpatrick, Mike Justus, Oakley Lehman, Daniel Stevens, Clay Donahue Fontenot, Glenn Foster, Paul Vallespi, Tanner Foust, Trevor Habberstad, Douglas Robson, Ben Wright, Kofi Yiadom, James Young and John Flanagan were stunt doubles for Robert Downey, Jr. in the role of Iron Man.
Brian Schaeffer was a stand-in for Robert Downey, Jr. in the role of Iron Man.
