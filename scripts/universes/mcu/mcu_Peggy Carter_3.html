<html><p>Edwin Jarvis approached, wondering what type of weapon he would be using on this assignment; Carter corrected him that he would not have one, citing the ease in which Underwood had just removed his wristwatch, much more a weapon. Carter turned the dryer back on so Underwood would not hear Jarvis' adamant and animated protests. When Underwood was ready, Carter briefed her on her assignment to get a blood sample from Whitney Frost, but Carter became annoyed as Underwood insisted on flirting with Jason Wilkes just to annoy Carter.

Growing Closer to Daniel Sousa
Carter listens in to the mission
While Edwin Jarvis and Dottie Underwood attempted to retrieve Whitney Frost's blood sample, Carter and Daniel Sousa stayed outside in a van to manage communications. Suddenly, Underwood's radio seemingly went dead. When Carter went to see what happened, she accidentally ripped open her stitches trying to open the door to the van.

Daniel Sousa tells Carter of his engagement
Sousa helped her back into her seat and helped her stop her bleeding. Carter said that she would need to see Violet again to treat her wound, but Sousa said that "they'll see". When asked if everything was alright, Sousa lied and said everything was okay. However, when questioned further, Sousa revealed that Violet had broken off their engagement, much to the surprise of Carter and Jarvis, who was eavesdropping using his radio. 

Carter and Daniel Sousa almost about to kiss
Carter said that she would talk to Violet, but Sousa disagreed, saying it was not a good idea. Carter kept insisting, but Sousa admitted that the reason Violet broke off the engagement was because she thought Sousa was in love with Carter. Carter was shocked at this revelation, and apologized to Sousa for ruining his life. They slowly leaned in towards each other to kiss, but were interrupted by a man being thrown out a window by Dottie Underwood above them and landing on top of their van, which knocked out all communications with Jarvis.

Quick Visit
Carter tells Jack Thompson she quits
As the sun rose, Carter, Jarvis, and Sousa returned to Howard Stark's Estate to show Jason Wilkes that, as far as he was considered, the mission was a success. Jack Thompson knocked on the door; Carter, who had earlier heard Jarvis tell Thompson that she was there all night, quickly put on a robe and greeted him like she had just awakened. Thompson asked her if she knew "Katherine Wexford", which she quickly denied. Thompson told her that he wanted her to return to New York City with him, on penalty of her job with the Strategic Scientific Reserve. Carter quit; Thompson told her that she was making a mistake that she would regret. As Thompson left, she told him that she would not.

From Famine to Feast
Carter watches Whitney Frost lying
Later, that morning, Carter and Daniel Sousa went to the entrance of Anvil Studios and watched as Whitney Frost, dressed in black, had a press conference to mourn the death of Calvin Chadwick and his friends during a boating accident; Sousa and Carter were sure that Frost killed her husband, but did not know how or why. Sousa and Carter also decided that they would later discuss their intimate moment when time permitted.

Carter is kissed by a tangible Jason Wilkes
Carter returned to Howard Stark's Estate to see everyone working hard on various projects; Ana Jarvis and Jason Wilkes worked on creating for him a containment chamber to keep him tangible, while Edwin Jarvis worked on repairing the transponder so Dottie Underwood could be located. When Carter showed more interest in finding Underwood than to the condition of Wilkes, Wilkes was clearly upset and began a tirade on how Carter sought Underwood to clear her own conscience; Wilkes quickly apologized though, citing that he was not feeling well. Later, the containment vessel was completed and Wilkes became tangible. One of his first actions was to sneak a kiss from Carter, which she passionately returned.

Carter and Edwin Jarvis discuss her situation
The signal of the transponder activated and the location of Underwood was determined; Carter and Jarvis knew that it was a trap. Jarvis demonstrated for Carter the function of the Jitterbug to assist them on the mission. On the drive to the Chadwick Ranch, Jarvis and Carter had a candid conversation about Carter having two suitors, Sousa and Wilkes; Carter explained that she respected both men, but genuinely did not know how she got into that situation or what to do to resolve it. The ride continued with less tension since Jarvis got that thought off his chest.

Distractions
Carter and Edwin Jarvis activating their Jitterbug
Carter, carrying a rifle, and Edwin Jarvis, carrying the Jitterbug, entered the Chadwick Ranch under the dark of night; Carter allowed Jarvis to act as a distraction as she knocked out the guard. Suddenly, other Manfredi Crime Family members began to converge on their location. Carter told Jarvis to activate the Jitterbug, but he wanted to wait for the right moment for maximum effectiveness. When he installed the code, nothing happened; Jarvis and Carter quickly surrendered.

Carter tries to free herself
The two were tied up in the same room as Dottie Underwood, who mocked them for their failed rescue attempt. Carter noticed that Underwood was slowly freeing herself; the two began to race to be the first one freed, as Underwood told Carter that if she was first, the results would be unpredictable. Meanwhile, as Jarvis was freeing himself, he constantly wondered what he did wrong with the Jitterbug.

Carter asks the setting on the Jitterbug
Underwood used that opportunity to berate Carter for the optimism she showed concerning the Strategic Scientific Reserve; Underwood told her that the organization was infiltrated by the Council of Nine and Carter needed to act solo if she wanted herself and her friends to have any hope of survival. Jarvis freed himself first, while Carter and Underwood freed themselves simultaneously. Suddenly, an explosion was heard; Jarvis explained that he had accidentally set the Jitterbug on delayed detonation. 

Carter realizes what the real trap was
As they exited, the Manfredi Crime Family men were all unconscious. Carter noted that Underwood was in pain, but Underwood insisted that it was from the torture of Vernon Masters. Carter was not fooled; she realized that Whitney Frost was not there and that Underwood must have revealed something to her. Underwood revealed that she was a distraction; Frost had gone to kidnap Jason Wilkes. Carter and Edwin realized that Ana Jarvis and Jason Wilkes were in danger.

Carter rushing back to Howard Stark's Estate
On the frantic drive to Howard Stark's Estate, Underwood noted that Carter looked scared. As they approached the Estate, Carter and Edwin saw Ana laying on the ground from a gunshot wound to the abdomen; the car with Frost and Wilkes sped away. Carter put Underwood in the trunk of the car and told the policeman at Waverly Memorial Hospital not to open it on order of the SSR. Inside, Carter briefed Doctor Chung that Ana was shot during a robbery, because Edwin was too shocked to speak. 

Carter comforts Edwin Jarvis
When Ana went into surgery, a man ran into the hospital saying that a policeman had been killed; Carter saw the open trunk and knew it was Underwood's doing. As the sun rose, Carter called Daniel Sousa to inform him of recent events; Masters answered the phone, letting Carter know that he had commandeered the Auerbach Theatrical Agency. Carter quietly walked over to Edwin who was still in shock and gently held his hand.

Rescuing Jason Wilkes
Carter comforts a distraught Edwin Jarvis
When Ana Jarvis got out of surgery, she had not woken up, so Carter stayed with Edwin Jarvis to help him. When Jarvis got angry, Carter tried to comfort him in the fact that Ana was alive, but Jarvis didn't know if shed ever wake up. Carter then left to collect some items for Jarvis from Howard Stark's Estate. When Carter arrived at the estate, she talked with Daniel Sousa about what had happened. Sousa then told Carter how Whitney Frost wanted the uranium rods, so Carter decided to use that to try and get Jason Wilkes back.

Carter talks with Joseph Manfredi
As Carter got changed, Sousa informed her of Joseph Manfredi as a way to reach Frost. Carter and Sousa then went to meet with Manfredi, but when they refused seeing him, they fought his men. Carter was able to speak with Manfredi, asking him to reach out to Frost, but he refused. They then blackmailed him, getting him to send a message to Frost. With a meeting set up, Carter had Aloysius Samberly create fake uranium rods to give to Frost in return for Wilkes. Jarvis arrived at the estate, and asked how they were going to handle Frost. Carter then spoke privately with Jarvis to try and tell him to be with Ana, but he instead on coming with them.

Jack Thompson gives Carter a file on her
Suddenly Howard Stark's Telex received a message which they learnt was designs specifics for a machine for a canon that fires pulses of high-energy photons that can eliminate Zero Matter. They had Samberly create the machine, as they all went on their mission. But before they could leave, Jack Thompson greeted them in the house and spoke with Carter, where he showed her a file on her in hopes for her to drop what she had on him and return to New York. However, Carter didn't let this stop her and tried to inform Thompson he was being played by Vernon Masters and that the files were likely false.

Carter is threatened by Jason Wilkes
Carter then left to meet up with Frost and they made the trade, however, Frost discovered that the rods were fake, so they left with Wilkes. Wilkes tried to tell Carter that Frost will keep coming for them, but she informed him of Stark's canon. Suddenly, Wilkes turned on them, holding them at gunpoint, demanding the uranium rods. Wilkes threatened to shoot Carter, so Sousa revealed their location. Wilkes then joined back with Frost informing them of the rods location at the Auerbach Theatrical Agency.

Reuniting with Daniel Sousa
Carter and Daniel Sousa discuss the plan
Carter and Daniel Sousa arrived at the facility, where they found Jack Thompson, whose memory had been recently wiped, and the uranium gone. Thompson was able to give them the coordinates to Whitney Frost that he had wrote down. They then prepared to stop Frost, allowing Thompson to come with them, now trusting him. Sousa then took a moment to reconfirm with Carter the priorities, as Jason Wilkes was no longer a hostage. Carter tried to assure him that Wilkes was just confused, but Sousa assured her he was desperate and was no longer on their side. However, Carter was offended that Sousa told her not to let her emotions get in the way of the mission, seeing how he did the very thing not too long ago.

Stopping Whitney Frost's Test
Carter asks about the Gamma Cannon
They all then drove to the coordinates location, Carter with Edwin Jarvis, who she was concerned was not in the best state of mind for the mission. They then noticed a rift open up in the sky, which they feared meant they were too late. They then set up the Gamma Cannon, which Carter questioned if it would work, which Aloysius Samberly was not able to confirm. Jarvis started to get restless, wanting to deal with Frost immediately, so he drove off, causing Carter to go after him, ordering the rest to get the cannon working. 

Carter is captured by Joseph Manfredi
Carter demanding Jarvis to stop, but he remained determined to get to Frost. Carter then noticed a the cannon fire at the rift, which closed it. Carter then arrived at Frost's location, but it was too late, as Jarvis shot her immediately. She then noticed Wilkes on the ground, alive, but so was Frost. Joseph Manfredi then arrived and was about to kill them, when Frost stopped him and told him to capture them, so he knocked the two out. 

Dreaming with a Song
Carter faced with choosing who she loves
While unconscious, Carter found herself in a dream where she was back at the New York Bell Company Office talking to her brother, telling him how much she missed him. Then, she entered th L&L Automat where she came across Angie Martinelli, and then was confronted by the love triangle she had been trapped in with Wilkes and Sousa. As the dream continued, through the form of a musical about Carter making her choice between the two men, she was informed by Jarvis to wake up, which she does after being punched by Rose Roberts.

Escaping with Edwin Jarvis
Carter uses the Hot Wire to escape
When Carter awoke, she and Jarvis were tied up and in a truck. Jarvis soon woke up, and as she was untying him, he tried to explain his actions, but Carter didn't care to hear it. Carter and Jarvis were able to escape the truck by using the Hot Wire in Carter's belt. They then started to walk, much to Jarvis' annoyance, where they argued about what had happened, Carter angry about Jarvis being blinded by seeking revenge and Jarvis angry at Carter getting Ana Jarvis shot.

Carter and Edwin Jarvis argue in the desert
Carter then confronted Jarvis about how the "adventures" they go on are merely a thrill for him, to which he can return home afterwards, and if there are any consequences, he blames her even though it was he choices he has made. Carter then proceeded, stating how she has suffered many losses, unlike Jarvis who still gets to go back to Ana, to which he revealed that she could no longer have children due to the injuries. The two then made amends with each other.

Carter knocks out Paul
At that moment, the truck they were in, returned having realized they were gone. Not wanting to just be captured again, Carter faked passing out, so that when Paul went to pick her up, she caught him off guard and knocked him out. She then rescued Jarvis from Ralph, and they drove away in the truck.

Questioning Vernon Masters
Carter questions trusting Vernon Masters
After dropping Jarvis off to be with his wife, Carter returned to the facility, and attacked Vernon Masters demanding to know where her allies were. However, Sousa and Thompson came in and stopped her, informing her that Masters was essential to their operation. After learning that she would be working with Masters to stop Frost, Carter voiced her doubt in trusting him. However, he established that they all had information on each other that they won't use so long as no one else does. They prepared to take out Frost, with the Gamma Cannon repaired and Carter and Sousa being backup, but when they went to drive, the car wouldn't start as Masters had double-crossed them. When they went to get Samberly's car, he revealed a secret plan to use the cannon as a bomb from Thompson. They then asked him to manufacture a jammer to block the frequency of the trigger.

Rescue of Jason Wilkes
Carter attempts to free Jason Wilkes
When they arrived at Thompson and Masters' location, Carter went to rescue Wilkes from Frost before the bomb would be set off. Carter then made her way into the Los Angeles Waste Management Facility, taking out any guards she came across, until she found Wilkes tied down. As Carter freed him, Wilkes tried to warn her to leave, as he was not in control of what was in him, but she wouldn't leave. The two then began to leave, but Wilkes ended up locking Carter out, not allowing her to be near him. Carter then left the facility and regrouped to find Thompson demanding they stop the jammer. When Samberly shut off the jammer, Carter held a gun to Thompson, refusing to let him murder Wilkes in the process.

Carter holds a gun at Jack Thompson
Carter gave Thompson a final warning, but he was set on following through with his plan. However, before he could trigger the bomb, a wave knocked them all down. They all went into the facility to investigate what had happened, discovering Wilkes, who had expelled all of the Zero Matter from his body. Suddenly, the Zero Matter on the floor started to move towards Frost, who fully absorbed it. Knowing they couldn't defeat her, they retreated.

Carter forgives Jason Wilkes for his actions
Frost attempted to chase them down, but she was struck down by a car driven by Jarvis with Howard Stark inside. They all then drove away, leaving Frost, who was only unconscious. When they returned to the Auerbach Theatrical Agency, Carter stayed with Wilkes as he explained the Zero Matter to Stark, as well as the dangers of Frost. Wilkes, now confirmed to be cleared of any Zero Matter, apologized to Carter for the way he acted previously, including holding a gun to her. However, the apology was cut short when Stark brought up the countless times Carter is put in danger.

Deal with Joseph Manfredi
Carter discusses stopping Whitney Frost
The next morning, while Carter, Wilkes and Stark were having breakfast, they discussed creating a new Gamma Cannon, as well as what to do after they extract it from Frost. They were then surprised when Manfredi came out holding Jarvis at gunpoint turned out to be a joke between him and Stark, who were friends. Manfredi told them that he was coming to them for help stopping Frost, who he too believed was too far gone.

Carter decides to work with Joseph Manfredi
However, Manfredi made it clear that he wanted to save her, unlike the rest of the group. He also informed them that she was planning on opening the rift again, which Carter believed they could use to extract the Zero Matter from Frost. Stark then suggested that they steal Frost's research on the rift, and Carter tasked Manfredi with luring Frost away so they could get to her room.

Infiltrating Whitney Frost's Home
Carter infiltrates Whitney Frost's room
That night, Carter and Sousa headed to the Chadwick Residence, where they waited for Manfredi to get Frost out of her room. When Frost left, they entered the room and took pictures of Frost's notes. As they did, Sousa expressed his gratitude in getting to work with Carter again. When they finished, they overheard Frost returning, so they escaped through the window. Carter and Sousa headed to the Agency to give the photos to Stark, Wilkes and Samberly.

Making their Plan
Carter assisting in coming up with a plan
They all then discussed creating machine to open the rift, along with any other possibilities of something going wrong. However, by working together, they were able to formulate a plan that would safely open the rift. As the three scientists went to work on the machine, Carter left them after settling a quarrel they had by naming the machine herself. Carter then assisted Jarvis in his role in the machine construction, in which she asked about Ana, who he reported was going to be fine. Thompson then entered, but Carter rejected his help, tasking him with getting dinner.

Defeat of Whitney Frost
Carter witnesses the rift being opened again
The next day, they all arrived at filming location of the Stark Pictures production, where they went through the plan. Wilkes informed them that anything close to the rift once it opens will begin to levitate towards it. With everything encountered for, Stark then activated the generator, which successfully opened the rift, leaving only for them to wait for Frost to come for it. Carter and Thompson then went to get into position to be on lookout for Frost.

Carter defeats and arrests Whitney Frost
As they waited, Thompson asked her about Carter if she was going to arrest him for working with Masters, but Carter told him she wouldn't, despite how Thompson has treated her. He then informed her of a key he found from Master's bag, of which neither knew what it was for. Suddenly, they heard Samberly scream, followed by Sousa reported Frost's arrival. They all then gathered by the Gamma Cannon as they watched Frost approach the rift. Stark then fired upon Frost, which successfully extracted the Zero Matter from her and into the rift.

Carter volunteers to manually close the rift
Carter then arrested Frost, but their victory was short lived when she learned that they were having trouble closing the rift. Stark informed them that the way to close the rift was to get to the generator and close it manually, being at risk of being pulled in. As they argued over who would be the one to do it, they discovered Sousa already making his way to the generator. As they watched Sousa struggle to close the rift, Carter tried to think of a way to save him, suggesting detonating the Gamma Cannon inside the rift.

Carter stopping Daniel Sousa from being killed
When Sousa started to levitate towards the rift, his rope came loose, so Carter, followed by everyone else, grabbed on and pulled back. As they held on, Jarvis returned with Samberly, as they used Stark's Hovercar and the Gamma Cannon's core to destroy the rift. Jarvis then activated the car, which flew into the rift, destroying it once and for all. With all threats now dealt with, they all took a moment due to being incredibly exhausted.

A Reason to Stay
Carter and Howard Stark discuss Zero Matter
The next morning, as Carter and Howard Stark ate breakfast, they argued over what could be done with Zero Matter. Stark believed that in the right hands it could excel scientific achievements, but Carter saw it as only a means for trouble. Jason Wilkes then joined them, and he and Carter discussed her returning home, as well as what might have been if they met differently, but Carter appreciated getting to know him the way she did.

Carter says her goodbyes to Ana Jarvis
Carter then went to leave Howard Stark's Estate, but when she walked out the door, she was reunited with Ana Jarvis, who had returned from the hospital. Ana was insulted for her trying to leave without saying goodbye, but Carter didn't know if Ana wanted to see her after what she had been through. However, Ana assured her she was fine, and the two hugged. Edwin Jarvis then offered to drive Carter anywhere, but she declined due to calling a taxi, which greatly upset him. Feeling bad, she decided to let Jarvis drive her, and he packed her luggage into the car,

Carter is asked to stay in Los Angeles
Carter had Jarvis drive her to the Auerbach Theatrical Agency so she could finish some paperwork. He insisted that he could take her to the airport, but Carter told Jarvis he had done plenty for her already. Before he departed, Jarvis spoke with Carter about how she fitted in Los Angeles, insisting her on not returning to New York. Carter stated that she had many reasons to return home, but Jarvis believed she only needed one good reason to stay.

Carter and Daniel Sousa share a kiss
Carter then met with Daniel Sousa as he finished the paperwork on the Isodyne Energy case. Sousa then began to criticize Carter on how she acted during the case, saying that she was reckless, much to her protest. Sousa continued to irritate Carter, which she soon understood was him messing with her in a flirtatious way, so she kissed him passionately. With their feelings for each other finally revealed, they embraced their relationship as they made out in Sousa's office. Carter then decided to use more vacation time in order to stay in Los Angeles for a while longer. However, their relationship would eventually end.

S.H.I.E.L.D.
Zodiac
Carter working for the SSR in Brooklyn
Carter eventually moved back to Brooklyn, New York City, continuing to work with the Strategic Scientific Reserve. Carter was stuck in an office run by John Flynn who patronized her and only used her for code-breaking and analysis, believing that, as a woman, she should not be sent into the field.

Carter sneaks through the warehouse
Three months into her work there, after all of her fellow agents had gone out for drinks, leaving her alone in the office, she received a call directing her to the location of the Zodiac and requesting agents to retrieve the substance. Carter used the absence of her co-workers as an excuse to take the mission, and traveled to the Zodiac's location, carrying a briefcase full of field gear with her. The place was guarded by two guards who told her she could not go in. Carter quickly subdued both of them and threw one through the window. The third guard managed to get a weapon but Carter quickly took him hostage. Cuffing him to a pipe, she made him scream for help.

Carter on a mission to obtain the Zodiac
When two other guards arrived she ambushed them and knocked them both out with a club. Using her gun she forced the last guard to retreat and lock himself in the room where the Zodiac was stored, believing himself to be safe. Carter continued advancing and shot several holes into the door, making one large hole, and threw a smoke bomb in the room to make the guard inside pass out. Using a gas mask, she entered the gas-filled room and quickly found the vial marked with a strange Zodiac symbol.

Carter is almost strangled to death
However, Carter was attacked by a huge guard in a gas mask. During the fight the guard managed to pull her gas mask off. While she was exposed to the gas the guard pinned her down and started to strangle her. On the verge of passing out, Carter managed to grab a knife from her briefcase and stabbed him. After she knocked out the final guard, Carter recovered the Zodiac and brought it back to the Strategic Scientific Reserve New York Office.

Carter is told she'll be running S.H.I.E.L.D.
The next day at the office, Flynn admonished Carter for her actions, saying that the only reason that she was an agent was that people felt sorry for her after Captain America died. In the midst of his tirade, the office hotline rang and he was informed by Howard Stark that he was to give the news to Carter that she would be running S.H.I.E.L.D., a new organization designed to supplant the SSR.

Later Life
Carter during S.H.I.E.L.D.'s early years
Carter continued working for the Strategic Scientific Reserve until 1949. During the same year, Carter personally oversaw the construction of a secret base that would later become known as the Playground. After that, Carter became the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., working alongside Howard Stark.

Carter is interviewed about Captain America
Sometime after the war, Carter married a man who had been saved by Captain America and together, they had a son and daughter. In 1953, Carter was interviewed about Rogers and their involvement in the war. She explained how she and Rogers met and worked together during Project Rebirth, with him changing her life long after his demise. Carter began crying when asked about speaking to Rogers in his final moments. This footage was on display at the Captain America Exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution.

Braddock's Unit
Carter is updated on Braddock's unit
In 1970, Carter was still working as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. with Howard Stark and Mitchell Carson, based out of Camp Lehigh. On April 7 of that year, Carter had a meeting with other agents outside her office. When she asked for Agent Braddock's unit to be brought in, an agent informed her that they had been stopped by lightning strikes, much to Carter's frustration. She then told him she would look at the weather projections, which revealed to her that it wasn't lighting strikes at all, so she rushed out to break this news.

Working with Ant-Man
In 1987, Carter worked with Hank Pym, a young scientist who invented particles and a suit that could shrink a human being to the size of an ant, yet maintain his original strength. When a group of radicals in the Soviet-controlled East Berlin discovered a piece of old HYDRA technology, Howard Stark wanted to send an agent to Germany and stop them from reverse-engineering it.

However, Pym was unwilling to give his suit to anyone else, so Carter convinced him to go to Berlin personally. To see if the suit actually worked, she fired a few bullets at Pym, and he became small like an ant in the blink of an eye, proving he was ready for the mission. He left for Berlin later that day.

When Pym returned from his mission in Berlin, he informed Carter and Stark about what had happened there. Stark tried to prohibit Pym from being able to do any further missions, but Pym stated that the only way the organization could use Pym Particles was if he was using them. Pym then implied that he was willing to help in any future missions available to him.

Hank Pym's Retirement
Carter is visited by Hank Pym in the Triskelion
In 1989, Hank Pym announced his resignation from the organization before Carter, Howard Stark and Mitchell Carson, after he had discovered that S.H.I.E.L.D. was trying to replicate the Pym Particles from the Ant-Man technology, showing his anger by slamming Carson's head onto the desk after he insulted him.

Carter listens to Howard Stark's statements
Carter and Stark attempted to convince Pym to reconsider, reminding him not to allow the death of his beloved wife, Janet van Dyne, to destroy the good work he had achieved at S.H.I.E.L.D.; however, Pym refused to give up the Pym Particles for as long as he was alive and left the Triskelion. As Pym exited out of the room, Carter watched and listened as Carson advised that Pym should be restrained and not get out of the building. Carter turned to Carson and advised him not to make Pym his enemy after he lied to him.

Retirement
Years later, her great-niece and Michael Carter's granddaughter Sharon Carter would grow an interest in S.H.I.E.L.D., and Carter strongly supported her becoming an agent, even buying Sharon her first thigh holster. However, Sharon never disclosed her relation to Carter due to the pressure of living up to her.

Reunited with Steve Rogers
Carter talking to Steve Rogers after his return
Before 2012, Carter had quit S.H.I.E.L.D. and retired. In her advanced age, she now had Alzheimer's disease, which forced her to stay at a retirement home in Washington, D.C.. After Steve Rogers returned from being frozen for nearly seventy years, he was given files about his allies from the 1940s, including Carter's. Thinking about calling her, Rogers initially decided against it, afraid of her seeing him still young.

Carter again happily identifies Steve Rogers
Two years after he was saved, Rogers eventually went to visit Carter at the retirement home where she lived and confided in her of his struggle to accept S.H.I.E.L.D.. Lucidly, Carter told him that it was a different world out there now and suggested a fresh start. After a brief coughing fit however, Carter suddenly forget their previous conversations and thought she was meeting Rogers for the first time since the Battle in the Valkyrie because in her mind, that was the last time they spoke.

Death and Funeral
Carter's memorial picture at her funeral
Carter died in her sleep on June 18, 2016. Steve Rogers served as a pallbearer during her funeral, where she was eulogized by her great-niece, Sharon Carter.

Time Heist
Stealing the Space Stone
Carter is observed by Steve Rogers
In an alternative 1970, Carter entered her office with a fellow agent, as she asked him to bring in Braddock's unit, However, the agent reported that the unit was stopped by lighting strikes, frustrating Carter. She then told him she would look at the weather projections, which revealed to her that it wasn't lighting strikes at all, so she rushed out to break this news. The entire time, Carter was unaware that Steve Rogers from 2023 was standing on the opposite side of the window.

Marrying Steve Rogers
Carter gets her dance with Steve Rogers
In an alternative 1949, while Carter was in her home she was shocked when Steve Rogers, who had travelled from the year 2023, arrived on her doorstep. The two then immediately had their dance that Rogers had promised her, as they held each other in their arms, sharing a kiss. Carter and Rogers would go on to live the rest of their lives together, secretly getting married and possibly having a child later on. This would create an alternate reality, which Rogers would leave after Carter's death in 2016.

Personality
Carter was tough and resilient, standing strong whenever she was mistreated, be it by man or woman. She had a sarcastic streak, and could also become close to a select few people, such as Steve Rogers, Howard Stark, Edwin Jarvis, and a few others. Though she believed in morality, she was willing to lie if the situation called for it, including the period when she was hiding her involvement with Howard Stark from the SSR.

A loyal soldier, Carter was willing to do whatever was needed to get the job done, very nearly having Howard Stark shot out of the sky, when he was endangering the city of New York. Such sacrifices wounded her; she did not enjoy it. Being somewhat no-nonsense, Carter did not take kindly to messing about during a mission or when there was work to be done. She was also quite clever, always able to work her way out of a pinch at a moment's notice. Though her number of dear friends was slim, she was exceedingly appreciative to those she had.

Abilities
Master Martial Artist: Carter was a highly skilled martial artist. Carter used her fighting skills to defeat Sasha Demidov before he could kill her. She was able to defeat several highly skilled agents with little effort. Despite initially being overwhelmed, Carter managed to defeat Dottie Underwood, a highly skilled Red Room assassin. Carter was also able to silently subdue the guards of the Zodiac. Carter used a direct and highly versatile fighting style; she was adept at constantly using her surroundings to her advantage. Carter was able to quickly use the weapons or clothing of her opponents against them. Highly opportunistic and able to improvise quickly, Carter could use nearly every item available to her as an improvised weapon.
Expert Marksman: During the assassination of Abraham Erskine, Carter was able to kill the driver of Heinz Kruger, as he drove towards her, without fear of being hit. She chided Rogers for interrupting her shot when she aimed for Kruger. While trying to obtain Zodiac, Carter shot at a steel door multiple times hitting the same spot to create a hole large enough for the gas grenade she had planned to drop.
Master Spy: Carter was able to infiltrate Castle Kaufmann and free Abraham Erskine with her disguise as "Eva". Likewise, she was able to flawlessly mimic other accents. She knew how to manipulate the sexist stereotypes of her time to her advantage by bringing coffee to a meeting in order to spy on it and seducing a man to gain information. She also spent time at Bletchley Park during the early years of World War II, learning code breaking skills.
Master Investigator: Carter was able to solve the Leviathan case very efficiently, including deducing that the person who manipulated Stark would be one of the women he had been with, and that that woman would likely have scars on her wrists from years of handcuffing herself to a bedpost. In a lot of cases Carter was able to connect evidence or spot things that her colleagues missed.
Expert Tactician: Though they were all seasoned war veterans, the Howling Commandos took instruction from Carter on how to infiltrate the Red Room Academy, following her leadership on how to divide the men and what to do in a given situation. Though both leaders of their respective branches of the SSR, Thompson and Sousa referred to Carter's plan to fight Whitney Frost.
Scientist: Carter had knowledge of chemistry, knowing how to use simple household items to create a compound necessary to render the lanthanum carbon alloy Nitramene inert and nonvolatile.
Thief: Carter was able to pickpocket an access card from an employee of Isodyne Energy with ease; however, she was not successful in using her Brooch Key to access Daniel Sousa's desk because he was too close to her.
Multilingualism: Carter could speak and read English, Russian and German fluently. She could also speak with a convincing American accent while undercover.
Equipment
Weapons
Carter shooting at Heinz Kruger's taxi cab
Walther PPK: Carter carried a Walther PPK as her sidearm during her time serving with the Strategic Scientific Reserve. Carter used the weapon to shoot at Heinz Kruger while trying to prevent his escape following the Assassination of Abraham Erskine, and to raid a warehouse in New York City during the search of Zodiac.
Walther PPK/S: Carter changed her weapon of choice to a similar model following the end of World War II. Carter used it mostly to threaten her enemies, such as Leet Brannis when she confronted him both at the Roxxon Refinery and in Cedar Grove. She also carried the weapon when investigating The Heartbreak until Jerome Zandow disarmed her, and while Howard Stark gave a press conference at the New York City Hall. Carter continued to use it when she traveled to Los Angeles, in order to defend herself from the men trying to kill Jason Wilkes, and when confronting Jack Thompson for wanting to detonate a bomb that would stop Whitney Frost but sacrificing Jason Wilkes' life.
Colt M1911A1: Carter chose this pistol from the arsenal at the Strategic Scientific Reserve Headquarters, and used it to shoot at Steve Rogers, testing the resistance of a Vibranium Shield he was carrying. Some years later, Carter obtained another from one of the Manfredi Crime Family members that were sent back to the desert to recapture her and Edwin Jarvis, using it to threaten the two goons and escape in the van where they had previously been kept as hostages.

MP 40: Carter managed to obtain one of these weapons while undercover on Castle Kaufmann, using it to liberate Abraham Erskine.
Ithaca 37: Carter took one of shotguns to investigate Howard Stark's Warehouse when Stark was kidnapped by Johann Fennhoff and Dottie Underwood. Before she could rescue Stark or stop the two Leviathan operatives, Underwood disarmed her, and had to defeat her in a hand-to-hand combat. Carter also used this shotgun to confront Underwood a year later, arresting her when Underwood tried to commit a robbery at the Bowery Savings Bank.
Winchester Model 1897: Carter carried this shotgun when she went to the Chadwick Ranch to rescue Dottie Underwood from Whitney Frost, but she was disarmed when Edwin Jarvis failed to enter the right code on the Jitterbug.
Winchester Model 1912: Carter, Jack Thompson and Daniel Sousa took these shotguns when they set up the ultimate trap for Whitney Frost at the Stark Pictures set, opening a rift to attract her and remove the Zero Matter from her body.
Winchester Model 1866: Edwin Jarvis gave Carter one of Howard Stark's hunting rifles loaded with tranquilizer darts in order to capture Rufus Hunt to interrogate him about his employers. Though Carter accurately shot the dart against Hunt, she had to struggle with him to hit him a second time with the dart, and Carter ended up hitting Hunt in the head with the back of the rifle.
M18 Smoke Grenade: A smoke grenade that Carter used to clear the room where Zodiac was being stored, incapacitating the only guard inside.

Trivia
In the comics, Margaret Alexandra "Peggy" Carter was an American freedom fighter with the French Resistance during World War II, and her relationship with Gabe Jones was one of the first inter-racial relationships in comics.
In the comics, Cynthia Glass shares many physical and biographical similarities with the MCU version of Peggy Carter, such as being a friend and love interest to Steve Rogers both before and after his transformation, and being considered his first love. However, Glass was a Nazi spy who sacrificed her life to save Rogers from the Red Skull.</p></html>
