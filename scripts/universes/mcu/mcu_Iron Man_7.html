<html><p>Stark flew over to Doctor Strange, who was bringing down a group of Thanos' forces into another dimension during the battlefield, and asked him whether this was the one the fourteen million futures that they'll win. Strange told him that if Stark knew what needed to happen, it wouldn't happen. Much to his skepticism, Stark decided to keep being optimistic and told Strange that he hoped that he was right about the outcome. Shortly after Thanos' airstrike on the battlefield, Captain Marvel destroyed the Sanctuary II, much to Stark's surprise.

Stark finds the Nano Gauntlet in the battlefield
Upon Captain Marvel retrieving the Nano Gauntlet from Spider-Man, she lost the item in an explosion which landed on the ground. After discovering the Nano Gauntlet in front of him, Stark prevented Thanos from getting the Gauntlet by tackling him, only to be knocked down and stalemated once again. While Stark rested for a while, he was knocked out. Thor, Captain America, and Captain Marvel tried to kill Thanos, only to fail due to his fighting powers.

Iron Man understands the outcome they win
After recovering from his knockout, Stark turned to Strange, who, visibly shocked, signaled to him that this was the one timeline he foresaw where they won. Finally realizing why Strange sacrificed the Time Stone five years ago to save his life and what had to be done, Stark briefly grabbed Thanos' arm, clinging onto the Nano Gauntlet, but was knocked to one side. Thanos triumphantly declared himself inevitable, before snapping his fingers once more.

Self-Sacrifice
Iron Man wields all six of the Infinity Stones
Despite seemingly having won over the fight for the Nano Gauntlet, nothing happened when Thanos snapped his fingers. Once Thanos looked over to Stark, he revealed to Thanos that he had transferred all six Infinity Stones to his Iron Man Armor, much to Thanos' horror of this discovery.

Iron Man wipes out Thanos and his armies
Stark bonded all six Infinity Stones onto the knuckles of his hand and felt the energy surging onto his body. Once he had all of the Stones at his disposal, Stark looked over to Thanos again and replied to him by saying that he was Iron Man before taking a long deep breath. After that was settled, Stark snapped his fingers in front of Thanos, as he watched all of his surrounding troops and armies turned into dust and, accepting his inevitable defeat, sat down and crumbled into ash.

Stark takes a peaceful rest before being found
Since he was merely a mortal man wielding the powers of the universe, the devastating force of the snap charred the right side of Stark's face and body. Stark collapsed among the debris of the New Avengers Facility. The physical toll from the Gamma Radiation and the raw energy from the Infinity Stones, was too much for him to endure. War Machine met up with Stark and discovered that he was seriously injured from the Stones before Spider-Man had came along.

Stark smiles at Pepper Potts for her arrival
Parker tried to contact Stark while he was slowly resting and began to feel pain. After being told that they won the battle, Parker was taken away by Rhodes, leading Pepper Potts to try to contact him. Stark softly uttered a greeting to Potts as his last words, having her to ask F.R.I.D.A.Y. to check his vitals. Potts told Stark that he could rest now, as he began to smile at her face before he died. Holding Potts' hand, Stark looked over to his right, leaving his Arc Reactor to lose its power.

Iron Man peacefully dies after his self-sacrifice
Once the Iron Man Armor was now turned off, Stark died in peace with his sacrifice, surrounded by Potts, War Machine, and Spider-Man, with Thor and Captain America looking onward, all devastated and honored by Stark's selfless act to save the universe. Upon seeing this, the Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Captain Marvel, took a knee to honor the legacy of Stark and his righteous sacrifice.

Legacy
Funeral and Tributes
Stark's sacrifice saved Earth from Thanos and his armies, therefore ensuring the continued survival of all living creatures in the known universe. However, his death profoundly impacted his friends and family. Many of Stark's closest friends were most clearly affected, having witnessed Stark's death firsthand, as they had most defining relationships with him. Stark's message to his wife and daughter, which he recorded prior to executing the Time Heist in the event of his death, was shown to them in the presence of Happy Hogan, James Rhodes and the remaining original Avengers, all of whom Stark considered close family.

Stark's funeral was held at the Stark Eco-Compound where he was mourned by his family and the remaining Avengers as well as Guardians of the Galaxy and multiple other heroes and allies of Stark who were also in attendance. Stark's original Arc Reactor; the one gifted to Potts as "proof Tony Stark has a heart," was placed on a wreath which was set adrift on the lake.

After the funeral, Hogan asked Morgan if she was hungry, to which she answered she wanted a cheeseburger. Remembering Stark's first request upon his return to the United States of America from Afghanistan, Hogan promised to take care of Morgan in her father's absence by giving her all the cheeseburgers she wanted. Later, an older Steve Rogers told Sam Wilson he chose to stay behind in the past because of what Stark said to him about "getting a life" for himself.

Worldwide Impact
The worldwide impact and outpouring of grief over Tony Stark's death was massive. Across the world, Stark's memory and legacy that he left behind as an Avenger was memorialized, notably in various forms of artwork, media, and merchandising. Murals commemorating Stark were found in cities such as New York, Venice and Prague. One such tribute was Heart of Iron: The Tony Stark Story, a biographical film about Stark and his legacy made shortly after his death.

In particular, the void that Stark left as the world's most renowned superhero led to speculation as to who would succeed him, which Quentin Beck had sought to exploit. Peter Parker, Stark's protégé, did his best to live up to his mentor's reputation, although Happy Hogan stated that no one, not even Stark himself, could live up to his name.

Hero In Death
A year after his death, Stark's necessary arrangements to anoint Spider-Man as part of his legacy were accomplished. Stark's glasses, outfitted with the E.D.I.T.H. A.I., allowed Parker complete control of Stark Industries weapons, drones, inventions, and the ability to hack any electronic device. Nick Fury, who had decided to take a vacation, instructed Talos to impersonate him and deliver the glasses to Parker.

Time Heist
Sudden Heart Attack
Stark argues with Alexander Pierce
In an alternate 2012, after defeating Loki in the Battle of New York, Stark helped Thor and S.H.I.E.L.D. escort him out of Stark Tower, as well as personally holding onto the Tesseract. When the group reached the first floor, they ran into Alexander Pierce, who demanded they hand over custody of Loki and the Tesseract.

Stark suffers a sudden heart attack
An argument then broke out between Stark and Pierce, who then tried to physically confiscate the Tesseract case from Stark. However, this was disrupted when Stark suddenly experienced a heart attack, which was caused by Ant-Man from 2023 tampering with his Arc Reactor. He then collapsed to the ground seizing as the onlookers called for a medic. Fortunately, Stark was was saved when Thor used Mjølnir to send a shock through his body. They then realized that Loki, along with the Tesseract, had mysteriously disappeared.

Personality
Many people in the media thought that Tony Stark was only just an egocentric playboy. As an adult, he was renowned for being casually arrogant, apathetic, callous, and a hedonist who enjoyed the finer things in life, namely drinking, gambling, partying and flirting. His wealth, power, and natural charm allowing him to get just about any woman he wants. But despite his rather carefree and overly confident personality, inside Stark's heart lied loneliness, as Ho Yinsen aptly described him as: "A man that has everything, but has nothing." Even following his reformation and birth as Iron Man, this stigma surrounding Stark persisted as many were quick to point fingers at him believing his arrogance and callous attitudes were the cause of many problems even if he would have only a tenuous connection to the issue at hand.

Before his kidnapping, Stark was a self-centered, arrogant person, caring for few people outside his closest friends. Even during this period of his life, he had a moral code believing the weapons he developed were being used exclusively by the United States and its allies for peaceful purposes, being appalled to discover that they were being sold on the black market. He also funded large humanitarian inventions and programs via his arms dealings, something he felt justified manufacturing weapons.

During the following years, however, Stark matured, gradually becoming more of a team player and less arrogant and cynical. He even began opening up and having a real relationship with Pepper Potts. Stark's exploits as Iron Man have lead him to reevaluate his life, thus he now strives to use his inventions in a more responsible and considerate way. A textbook example of a Byronic hero, he never fully let go of his character flaws, however, using them to push him forward as a reminder to do better and often making self-deprecating jokes or comments. Despite this attitude, Stark is an exceptionally brave and selfless individual as shown when he single-handedly faced a near-omnipotent Thanos armed with nothing but a knife without hesitation, a trait that earned him the Titan's genuine respect as a hero.

His experiences while imprisoned by the Ten Rings, especially his injury and seeing his weapons being used by terrorists, hardened Stark into a brave, determined, and somewhat ruthless fighter. Seeing first hand how innocent people were being harmed by his weapons and business while he remained ignorant greatly enraged him, resulting in him being uncaring in killing his foes, though he avoided doing so when he could. He was also willing to kill to protect his allies and friends, boldly saying he would kill Drax if Star-Lord killed Spider-Man. Despite this, he was not merciless, as he offered several of Aldrich Killian's men a chance to stand down, allowing the sole survivor to leave peacefully upon doing so. Even when confronted by Captain America's betrayal, he offered the man several chances to step aside.

Even after starting a new life as a superhero, Stark kept his sense of humor and his penchant for showmanship, the latter being demonstrated in his armor’s red and gold color schemes, and in revealing his identity in public despite being told not to. Tony has also shown a strong liking towards heavy metal and rock music groups like Black Sabbath, AC/DC, and Queen. He also shows signs of being a gearhead owning and modifying several expensive cars, having a particular liking towards the Audi R8 model line.

Stark was also known for being exceptionally intelligent, innovative and resourceful, having built a miniaturized Arc Reactor from scratch in Afghanistan. His intellect earned him the "Da Vinci of Our Time" nickname, and his inventions of Stark Industries have revolutionized technology for mankind. His past as a businessman had turned him into a very pragmatic individual always taking the quickest, most efficient way out of a problem commenting to Captain America that he would simply "cut the wire" when given the scenario of laying on barbed wire to let others cross it. This behavior put him at odds with the majority of the Avengers during the Avengers Civil War, as they were unwilling to compromise and negotiate with the United Nations regarding the Sokovia Accords which Stark viewed as the easiest way to continue the Avengers' mission of saving people and appease the public's growing fear and unease regarding the team. As a result of this negotiator attitude, Tony was one of three Avengers to not become a fugitive by the end of the Civil War and allowed to continue saving people with the support of the United Nations. This pragmatism extended to his fighting style, as he was quick to shift over to weapons more suited to the situation or having F.R.I.D.A.Y. scan Captain America's fighting style for openings to predict and exploit. He further displayed his combative pragmatism during the Battle of Titan by first restraining the Infinity Gauntlet before unleashing an unrelenting barrage on Thanos.

Stark could also be a reliable friend, and occasionally showed affection toward his teammates. Hence, Stark was the only Avenger who encouraged Bruce Banner to embrace his identity of Hulk as a blessing rather than a curse, and trusted him to make good use of Hulk's powers. He has also adopted a mentor role towards Peter Parker, seeing himself in the young hero, and helping him become better by designing an advanced Spider-Man Suit and quietly teasing him about his aunt May Parker, whom Stark considers attractive, Tony was in fact the only Avenger who believed in Parker and sought out his aid. When Tony was caught up by the terrifying vision of Scarlet Witch, he was possessed and haunted with great fear of losing all his fellow Avengers while he could have done something to save them, and having to live on after they had all been murdered, which was the primary motivator of him starting the Ultron Program. During the Avengers Civil War, however, Tony became distant and hardened towards his former teammates, especially Captain America, for their unwilligness to negotiate or hear the other side's arguments, though he still cared for them. When they fought in Siberia, Tony tried to avoid hurting Rogers, who aggressively protected Barnes, destroying Tony’s arc reactor to do so. Both Stark and Rogers never fully lost their trust in each other, though when they reunited, Stark mercilessly held the rogue Avengers responsible for the schism that had divided the team and left Earth unprepared for Thanos, noting that they had ignored his warnings and obstructed his desire to prepare. Five years later however, Stark abandoned this attitude, noting that resentment was "corrosive" and not a feeling he enjoyed.

After the Battle of New York, Stark developed a strong fear, that in this new world of "gods" and "aliens," he would be unable to protect the ones he loves, which induced him to become paranoid and full of anxiety, which, in turn, influenced Stark to build the first Iron Legion, and then the Ultron AI, so that the only threats against Earth were from Earth itself. His fear gave him something of a perfectionist personality and caused him to so intently focus on issues and problems that he unconsciously ignored other matters around him which led to a strain in his relationship with Pepper Potts and his somewhat negative reputation in the Avengers.

Compared to his fellow Avengers, however, Tony was very forward-thinking, always seeing a "big picture," willing to take risks, compromise his morals and dabble in shades of gray to achieve results. As seen with the Sokovia Accords, Stark was willing to endure hardships in the present to build a better future. He was also confident of his ability to negotiate, a belief supported by him negotiating a deal that would have made the Capture of Winter Soldier legal, though he knew that this talent had its limits, expressing regret that he could do nothing to free the rogue Avengers from the Raft. This more nuanced behavior often put him at odds with his fellow Avengers, especially Captain America, who were content with the status quo. Combined with his unpredictability, some people such as Scarlet Witch thought he was destructive, with her believing that Ultron's inability to distinguish between saving the world and destroying it comes from Tony. 

During times of great stress and frustration, Stark could become very short-tempered and intolerant of those whom he considered his intellectual inferiors for delaying a solution to the problem either mocking/berating them or ignoring them entirely. This behavior extended to both allies and foes.

Stark was much closer to his mother, Maria Stark, than to his father Howard with whom he had mixed feelings for, as he thought he was "cold and distant," which Nick Fury, however, claimed to be false. He still cared for him a great deal as he wished he could've said goodbye. While he was researching a new element for his Arc Reactor, Tony came across a message left by Howard, telling his son that his “greatest creation” was him.

Though having learned more of Howard's flaws and shortcomings, Stark still retained lingering issues with his father using his parenting as an excuse for being such a strict mentor to Spider-Man. He was aware of this flaw, however, and consciously attempted to grow out of it. During the Time Heist, after talking with his father Howard and realizing how difficult it was for Howard to raise him due to having an abusive father as well and having had experiences as a father, Tony finally came to reconcile with Howard and even shed his façade temporarily by hugging his father and saying that he loved him.

Following the Avengers Civil War, Stark adapted into a new role: that of a mentor to the inexperienced superhero, Spider-Man. He connected with Parker due to the similarities between that of him and Stark, such as their love of science, technology, and heroic deeds, yet Stark was not blind to Spider-Man sharing some of his flaws and does his best to stop him from making the same mistakes Iron Man himself has made in the past. Like most mentors, Stark encourages Parker to be more forward-thinking and imaginative with his abilities while also being conscious of Peter's limitations and wanting to keep him out of fights he felt were too dangerous. Though he could come off as somewhat aloof and detached in his dealings with Spider-Man, this was all done with the intent of making Parker a better superhero than Tony ever was, and after the defeat of Vulture, Stark believed he had succeeded even going so far as to offer the young hero a spot in the Avengers. Some months later, their relationship had strengthened to the point that Stark was openly saddened by Parker's death upon Thanos' completion of the Infinity Gauntlet.

Though considered a hobby, obsession or part of his itinerary, Stark considers the relationship between the Iron Man Suit and himself to be symbiotic, in that he and the suit himself are one. By the time of Aldrich Killian's terrorist attack, he had designed 42 variations of the armor as well as having stylized them with their own color designs, personalities, and names. He often referred to his suit as "he" when he was remotely controlling it with Potts and exclaimed when the suit's finger was pulled off, claiming it would hurt him. This is further supported during and after the Avengers Civil War whereupon the armors became incredibly streamlined and were designed to emulate a second skin. However, he does claim after the Clean Slate Protocol, that despite being without his suits he is still Iron Man.

In spite of his love of the spotlight, the idea of a normal life intrigued Tony greatly as he made attempts to extradite himself from the Iron Man persona and indeed, prior to his involvement in the Infinity War, pondered the possibility of he and Pepper having children together. After the disastrous outcome of the Infinity War, Tony indeed decided to retire and marry Pepper, having a daughter called Morgan Stark. His familial life allowed Tony to find a sense of peace and contentment as a husband and father and this was the primary reason of his refusal to to return to being a superhero when presented with a potential chance to undo it all but in the end his guilt over Parker's death allowed him to overcome this and he showed the same amount of selflessness as he had before, willingly sacrificing himself to kill Thanos and his whole army. Despite the agonizing pain he was subjected to as he died, he had accepted his fate, refusing aid and instead finding comfort in the presence of his friends and loved ones, dying with no regrents.

Powers and Abilities
Tony Stark did not possess any innate powers; instead, he used a miniature version of the Arc Reactor to charge the various suits that provided him with superhuman strength, endurance, durability, and a variety of weapons. His original advanced technology combined with his extraordinary intelligence and adaptive combat skills made Tony Stark one of the most formidable superheroes in the world. Aside from Thor and Doctor Strange, Tony Stark was the third person to stand his ground and fought the Infinity Gauntlet empowered Thanos the longest, even managing to give him a cut on his cheek and earn the respect and admiration of Thanos himself.

Armor Capabilities
Design
With the exception of the Mark I Iron Man armor, almost all of the Iron Man suits shared a common design and capability set. The suit was a powered exoskeleton with armored plating, capable of enhancing the wearer's strength, speed, agility, and endurance. The suit was powered by a miniaturized Arc Reactor, either using the one surgically installed in Tony Stark's chest or else built into the chest-piece of the armor itself.

The original armor Tony Stark created, the Iron Man Armor: Mark I, while in captivity in Afghanistan was crudely designed and bulky, but still had the necessary capacity to help him escape his captors. It was bulletproof, had two built-in flamethrowers, a rocket launcher, as well as rocket boosters for short-range flight, though their construction was faulty and they malfunctioned almost immediately after activation. Like all of Stark's armors, the Mark I enhanced Stark's physical strength beyond the capabilities of any human, allowing him to effortlessly overpower and kill multiple Ten Rings insurgents, break through stone walls, bend metal, and exert many tons of force. The armor's durability and resilience allowed it to be unfazed by bullets, tank shells, explosions, and extreme amounts of impactive force, such as impact from falling at high altitudes. Due to its rudimentary design, and Stark's lack of more sophisticated resources, the Mark I did not have an onboard AI system or augmented-reality (AR) displays like the later armors.

The helmet served only as a simple faceplate and was not fully sealed. Stark refashioned the special iron-copper-magnesium alloy from disassembled Stark mortar cannons into the Mark I armor, rendering it bulletproof. To power the thrusters on the boots, Stark siphoned the propellant fuel from four S-class ballistic missiles into two M-class mortars, creating two homemade fuel tanks, welded shut except for the valves connecting fuel hoses that led down the armor's legs.

The later model armors' helmet featured a retractable visor that projected a holographic AR displays to the wearer. The features of the helmet roughly resembled a human face, with eyepieces and a mouth slit showing the point where the faceplate meets the jaw.

The armor's primary weapon, as well as means of propulsion, was repulsor nodes built into the hands and feet. The repulsors in the boots provided the majority of the propulsion force while the nodes in the armor's gauntlets were used as flight stabilizers. Due to the intense heat and concussive pressure produced by the repulsors, the ones built into the gauntlets were also used as weapons, capable of neutralizing or killing enemies depending on the intensity projected. When needed, the primary repulsor built into the armor's breastplate could be charged to deliver a powerful, destructive unibeam blast.

The Mark II was built from basic titanium alloys, giving it a silver look. From the Mark III onward, Stark used a gold-titanium alloy to provide the necessary power-to-weight ratio coupled with the ability to resist icing at high altitudes. As the gold-colored suit seemed a bit ostentatious, Stark took to coloring certain segments of the armor hot-rod red to tone it down a bit without losing the flair he was known for. Later suits were given a variety of colors, from blue to black to green and even yellow and purple.

Until the development of Mark V, Stark focused on refining basic systems shared by all later models, ignoring the ease of putting on and taking off armors, resulting in Mark II, III, and IV all having lengthy and uncomfortable suit-up and suit-off periods. The Mark V marked Stark's first attempt at making his armors easily available when he needed to put them on outside. However, Mark V was experimental in nature and built specifically for testing out new technologies addressing suit-up problems. Couple that with its compact and lightweight form, proved underpowered in terms of functionality. Stark designed and constructed a ring specifically for easily donning and taking off his Mark VI armor until he can finally solve the issue without compromising on functionality.

It wasn't until the Mark VII that the issue was finally resolved, through enabling armors to move in one whole set on its own without the user in it, and open up to fit the user inside when needed, allowing Stark to don his armor within seconds for the first time. All Iron Man armors made since then were built with this ease-of-donning feature perfected in Mark VII, with each armor design allowing the individual parts of the suit to form around Stark, assembling itself over him with ease. This culminated in the Mark L, which used nanotechnology to seamlessly materialize the armor over Stark. The design philosophy had the added benefit of being able to control the armors via remote control, effectively making the armors into humanoid drones.

Performance and functionality-wise, through the design of the Mark XI, Stark stuck with a basic design and aesthetic, merely improving the technology and increasing the weapons' capabilities. From the Mark XI onward, he began crafting armors with specialized capabilities, beginning with stealth systems. By the time he built the Mark XV, he began giving the armors individual names to better identify them among the ever-growing set and in terms of their specialized abilities.

Stark used his technologically sophisticated armors to become Iron Man. The many systems of the armors allowed him to fly at supersonic speeds and contained various weapons for battle. He frequently improved the technology put into his armors, giving them upgrades for battles and to perfect the onboard systems. He had created a collection of suits for him to choose from; some are mission-specific or prototypes for testing out various capabilities, others are older models kept for nostalgia or for research. As the multi-billionaire head of a global corporation and a genius-level inventor, Tony Stark could procure or develop the additional technology needed as soon as possible. The Iron Man Armor is arguably one of the most powerful man-portable weapons on the planet.

Alone, the Mark I was sufficient enough to allow him to go through armed terrorists in order to escape. The Mark II was sufficiently powerful enough to go toe to toe with a more advanced and updated version of the armor (the Mark IV). The Mark III was able to easily dispatch some of the Ten Rings terrorists with ease and battle the Iron Monger Armor, albeit with some difficulty (due to the fact that it was powered by the first generation mini-Arc Reactor and the Iron Monger was powered by the second Arc Reactor he made upon his return). The Mark V, while lacking additional weaponry and flight capabilities, was still able to take on Ivan Vanko while he was just utilizing just the first Whiplash Armor, with Stark relying primarily on his repulsors. The Marks VI and VII proved to be the most powerful generation suits used by Stark at the time.

They were powerful enough to battle hordes of Hammer Drones, Vanko with his own advanced Whiplash armor, survive and battle two Asgardian gods (Thor and Loki, respectively) and hordes of Chitauri foot soldiers and a Leviathan with ease. The Marks 8 through 42, most of which were not even built for combat, proved nonetheless to be a significantly more powerful generation suits as they were able to battle nanotech-enhanced human soldiers, who themselves had enough strength and combat capabilities to match any of the armors.

Support Powers
Iron Man catching a 2.51-2.73 ton car
Superhuman Strength: When inside the armor, it amplified the user's physical strength, allowing Iron Man to lift in excess of sixty tons. Most armors were strong enough to lift and bench press tanks, S.H.I.E.L.D. Lifeboats or cars. Iron Man was also able to fight Ultron's second robotic body, and, when his strength was temporarily boosted by Mjølnir's lightning; increasing his suit's power to over four hundred percent capacity. Iron Man was able to hold his own against the mighty Asgardian Thor himself. A unique feat of strength was when Iron Man pushed and jump-started one of the rotors of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier while in the Mark VI.
Superhuman Reflexes: While not on par with that of someone with genuine superhuman speed and reflexes like Spider-Man, Iron Man's armors nonetheless had motors for movement, and they were shown to be extremely fast and responsive both in flight and during combat, even against physically enhanced opponents such as Captain America or the Winter Soldier. The suit's coordination and dexterity allowed the user to easily maneuver themselves and change directions with great ease during flight.
Stark using repulsor technology to fly in mid-air
Flight: One of the armor's most important features was its propulsion system and subsequent ability of flight. The armor could reach speeds as high as Mach 3 in moments. It also had variable control surfaces for active flight control by J.A.R.V.I.S. to automatically stabilize the armor in flight. The armor was able to fly at speeds more than fifteen hundred miles per hour. However, the armor showed it could fly at supersonic speeds at the drop of a hat. By the time of the Battle of New York, the Mark VII armor's flight system was improved with additional boosters on the back. It enabled the armor to quickly evade enemy attacks, go faster, and also the ability to better maneuver himself and shoot while in flight; due to the fact that he didn't have to use his hands to keep himself stabilized all the time. He was able to reach Tennessee from California in a matter of a few hours.
Armor Systems: The armor had remote assistance from J.A.R.V.I.S. or F.R.I.D.A.Y., who managed the armor's systems at Stark's command, and the armor also had a holographic HUD with heads-up displays for navigation, power level, armor status, weapons systems, vital signs with cellphone and computer connections in the helmet, and a built-in loudspeaker. The armor was powered by a miniature Arc Reactor and has an onboard generator for emergencies. The scanner systems were capable of scanning the environment, weather conditions, and equipment for information.
Iron Man's suit absorbs lightning from Mjølnir
Energy Conversion Power Recharge: The armor was able to absorb and convert energy sources, such as heat, kinetic energy or energy from the planet itself into electricity, directly into the batteries for recharge. Thor struck it with a full lightning blast from Mjølnir, but Stark was amazed to find that all it did was charge up the suit to 475%, allowing him to use a powerful repulsor blast and increase his strength substantially enough to give Thor a decent fight. Iron Man and Thor intentionally replicated this technique with the former's most advanced armor and Thor using both Mjølnir and Stormbreaker in the final battle against Thanos.
Self-Contained Life-Support System and Environmental Protection: The armor could be completely sealed for operations in vacuum or underwater, providing its own life support. It was also shielded against radiation. The armor was shown to be capable of operating underwater, was resistant to water damage, and displayed no sign of faults once submerged underwater; however, many earlier suits were not designed for space travel. Most of Iron Man's later armor systems were capable of space and underwater travel.
Heads Up Display (HUD): The Heads-Up display showed important things for the suit. The Heads Up Display of the Iron Man suit was powered by F.R.I.D.A.Y., Stark's artificial intelligence. The Suit also had Defensive and Offensive sections, able to switch around the sections, resorting to missiles and lasers. The HUD could also be talked to, and F.R.I.D.A.Y. would reply to it. The HUD could scan people, missile identifications, make calls, and give crucial suit credentials such as power. The HUD also had navigational (GPS) support. The suit also had radio capabilities, shown by Tony Stark talking to the Avengers as well as Nick Fury and Maria Hill at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.
Armor Summoning: Thanks to the new repulsor flight system, as well as the magnetic implants embedded in Tony's forearms, individual pieces of later armors could self-assemble themselves onto Tony or others. Tony was able to remotely summon the Mark XLII to Pepper for her to wear after his home was attacked by the Mandarin's forces. Tony summoned the Iron Legion to fight against Aldrich's Extremis soldiers at the oil drilling platform. In a failed attempt to kill Aldrich Killian, Stark forced Killian into a suit that would then self-destruct. He was also able to use this to summon the gauntlet of the Mark XLIII to pick up Loki's Scepter, and also once more, along with a chest piece, to defend himself against Captain America's attack during the creation of Vision.
Mini Thrusters: Iron Man could summon small circular thrusters that could open up and attach to a surface to aid Iron Man in difficult situations. This was shown when he summoned thrusters with Iron Man Armor: Mark XLVII to assist him in repairing the ferry that Spider-Man failed to save.
EMP Projectiles: At the beginning of the Clash of the Avengers, Iron Man launched a device that emitted an electromagnetic pulse on a helicopter that prevented Captain America and Winter Soldier from escaping with it. The device disrupted and disabled the helicopter's machinery.
Powered Clamps: Tony could launch two disc-like projectiles consecutively with retractable metal fibers that could form a powered clamp to bind enemies. It was powerful enough to bind the legs of Captain America.
Defensive Powers
Superhuman Durability: The armor was made up of a strong lightweight Titanium Alloy, with interlocked plates for the shell, and a chest plate protecting the Arc Reactor. It has been shown to withstand tremendous amounts of punishment. The armor could withstand tank shells exploded in close proximity to Stark, and a resulting fall from several thousand feet up, followed by hits by twenty millimeter Vulcan shells and a high-speed collision with an F-22 Raptor with only minimal cosmetic damage. It was able to survive a full-on fight with an older generation suit throughout Stark's house, the fights with the Hammer Drones and Whiplash, and having several cars dropped on top of him by Scarlet Witch, all of which resulted in taking relatively minor damage. Most of all, it protected the wearer from the effects of extreme g-force. It even allowed him to withstand some of Thor's attacks, although Thor proved he could crush the suit's gauntlet frame with his strength. He was able to withstand the force of a turbine from the Helicarrier's engines when he got it to work again after removing the debris blocking it. It was also able to withstand a full-on assault from the Chitauri forces' energy weapons. The Mark 42 was able to take damage from having most of Tony's house collapse on him at the bottom of the ocean and being hit by a Mack truck, although, Stark was not in the armor and was instead remote-controlling it.
Advanced Combat Analysis: The Mark XLVI armor and component artificial intelligence F.R.I.D.A.Y. had the ability to analyze people's specific fighting patterns, and in turn, find a counter to said fighting style. When Stark was unable to defeat Captain America in hand to hand combat, he had F.R.I.D.A.Y. analyze the pattern of Rogers' moves and find the openings. Once she had done so, Stark was able to briefly overpower Rogers with aid from his repulsors, although Rogers was still ultimately able to win.
Offensive Powers
Stark takes aim with his repulsor gauntlet
Repulsors: Particle weapons in the palm gauntlets that fired beams or blasts of concussive and explosive force, allowing them to repel physical and energy-based attacks. Early repulsors needed time to recharge after use, but, because of the new Arc Reactor, later repulsors were able to fire at a moment's notice and with far more controllable degrees of intensity. The repulsors have been shown to be strong enough to kill regular humans with one strike, destroy most stone and metal objects with ease, and destroy unmanned battle drones. When the suit was charged with additional power, the repulsors were powerful enough to stun even a superhuman with sufficient durability like Thor. It also enabled him to stun Loki on two occasions and takedown numerous Chitauri foot soldiers and airships with ease. His repulsors shot down two of the three attack helicopters that destroyed his house and were capable of killing Extremis-enhanced soldiers at full charge. The repulsors now can fire in the form of segmented bolts and blasts instead of just beams. Also, by the sixth armor, the repulsors could become small laser-like welding beams, which Stark used to install an Arc Reactor for Stark Tower. By the time of the Mark XLIII and Mark XLVI, repulsors became capable of launching targets off their feet without killing them, meaning they could function with intensity low enough to incapacitate and render targets unconscious, with Falcon being left with a black eye and bruises after being shot in the chest. Despite this, they were still strong enough to incapacitate super soldiers such as the Winter Soldier and Captain America, though they each proved resilient enough to continue fighting. This design was also fitted into the Iron Legion, whose repulsor blasts were capable of both repelling and knocking targets unconscious, as was done to Rhodey, who was thrown from a window onto the balcony of Avengers Tower but was otherwise left with an injured arm. By the time of the Mark L and Mark LXXXV, the repulsors could generate energy that could rapidly repel large and heavy targets with ease, which allowed Stark to send a car that had been telekinetically launched by Ebony Maw at him flying back at him. With the addition of these suit's being able to manifest additional structures onto themselves via their nanite properties, they were able to materialize apertures around the hands that were able to further focus and enhance the power behind his repulsor blasts, with Stark creating one such array of energy cannons that sent Cull Obsidian flying across an entire city block.
Unibeam: A more powerful version of the hand repulsor located in the chest. However, it required more power from the Arc Reactor to use and could not be used as often. Iron Man used a blast through the chest to kill Extremis-enhanced Eric Savin after Savin survived a shot to the head from his repulsors. Indeed, the Unibeam was also powerful enough to disintegrate the Winter Soldier's prosthetic arm.
Iron Man cuts through the Helicarrier
Lasers: A powerful weapon in the gauntlet wrists that could cut through any common metal. However, it was not strong enough to penetrate a Leviathan's shell. It has been shown to be very proficient against the Hammer Drones but Stark stated it only had a one-time use. Later, improved versions were used on several occasions in later models. They drew power from the Arc Reactor for more sustained operations, and could theoretically reduce the armor energy reserves to a drained state if operated indefinitely.
Smart Micro-Guns: Small anti-personnel guns in the shoulders that could target individual targets at once and fire at a moment's notice. They proved to be highly effective against unarmored foot soldiers. They could be used to incapacitate rather than killing, allowing them to be used to incapacitate HYDRA agents during the assault on Baron Wolfgang von Strucker's research base in Sokovia.
Iron Man fires a missile at a Ten Rings' tank
Missiles: Among the most proficient of the armor's weapon system was the missiles which he first used against a tank sent by the Ten Rings. The earliest incarnations of the armor held a multi-fire adhesive grenade launcher in the upper arm. It included Anti-Tank, Armor-Piercing rounds. In later models, the armor had mini-rockets hidden in a secret compartment in the boosters on the back, that blew up numerous Chitauri ships. Stark was able to destroy a Leviathan by flying into its mouth and launching them throughout its body with missiles in compartments in his knees. When using the Mark VII, he was able to use a missile hit by a repulsor to take down an attacker. From the Mark XLIII onward, the missiles used by the armor were shown to explode on impact rather than first attaching to the target, with the launchers for the missiles usually being located on either the arm or shoulder. Additionally, their destructive power grew, allowing them to blast through stone and metal.
Flamethrowers: Stark's first Iron Man suit had flamethrowers mounted on each arm which he used during his escape from the Ten Rings base. He used them to kill several terrorists and to destroy the base. This design was unique only to the first suit and Stark never integrated it into any of his other suits.
Direct Cybernetic Interface: Thanks to micro-repeaters injected into his left forearm, Stark could mentally and remotely control the Iron Man armors beginning with the Mark XLII either as a whole or in pieces with a combination of gestures and thought. This is further augmented by a holographic headset, which allows Stark to see through the Mark XLII's primary camera and allowing for complete remote control of the armor as though he were wearing it. The system was still in the test phases when Stark was forced to use it during his campaign against Aldrich Killian and had a tendency to fail at random.
Armor-Link: Stark could mentally command the armor with his thoughts even when he was fully unconscious. The Mark XLII almost attacked Pepper Potts in bed when Stark was having a nightmare. Potts' screams woke Stark in time to shut down the armor. He could also use a holographic headset that mimicked the armor's heads-up display and allowed him to remotely control the armor as if he were inside it. He used this headset to remotely pilot the Mark XLII while he was on a speedboat with James Rhodes searching for Killian. He sent the armor aboard Air Force One to battle and kill Eric Savin and save its surviving occupants. Two years later he displayed these abilities with regards to the Mark XLIII, being able to summon pieces of it on telephonic command.
Former Powers
Nigh-Omnipotence: During the Battle of Earth, Stark managed to steal the Infinity Stones from the Nano Gauntlet worn by Thanos using the nanotechnology in his armor and use said nanotechnology to create an Infinity Gauntlet of his own to allow him to harness the Stones, thus granting him nearly unlimited levels of power and allowing him to do almost anything he desired with a simple snap of his fingers, as shown when he used the power of all six Stones to wipe Thanos' armies and even Thanos himself out of existence, but this came at the cost of his life as his body could not bear the extreme amounts of energy unleashed by using all six Stones at once.
Death Inducement: After switching out the Infinity Stones from the Nano Gauntlet worn by Thanos into his own armor, Stark shaped an Infinity Gauntlet out of nanotechnology in the armor to safely handle the Infinity Stones. With one snap of his fingers, Stark collectively used the Infinity Stones to decimate all of Thanos' forces and even forcing Thanos to disintegrate into ashes, ending the Mad Titan's existence. However, due to Stark's human physiology, his body could not bear such a taxing use of the Infinity Stones, even with his armor, so the process also ended up fatally wounding Stark.

Abilities
Genius-level Intellect: Stark was one of the smartest humans in the world, surpassing even his late father, Howard Stark, while rivaled only by fellow geniuses like Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange, Hank Pym, and Helen Cho, with Thanos, who easily deluded Iron Man into believing Loki was unaided in his invasion while in actuality he had much of his resources from Thanos, and Shuri, the smartest person in the world, being the only ones to outclass him. As a result, Stark was known by the nickname "The Da Vinci of Our Time", and despite initially being deemed unfit for the Avengers Initiative, Nick Fury and Black Widow still respected Stark's genius enough for him to be recruited as a consultant for S.H.I.E.L.D. Stark's genius extended to his prolific mechanical engineering, electronic and electrical engineering, scientific, computer, business, strategic, piloting and linguistic skills. Throughout his life, Stark accomplished numerous intellectual feats, such as constructing scores of highly-advanced technological exoskeletal armors, figuring out a method for synthesizing a new element, discovering a means of allowing Time Travel through the Quantum Realm, and outsmarting the past rendition of the Mad Titan Thanos in battle.
