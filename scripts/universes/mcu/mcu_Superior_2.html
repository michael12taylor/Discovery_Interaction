<html><p>Looking at her new Prosthetic Arms, the Superior commented that he had heard about Ruby Hale maiming Rodriguez, during her previous mission, comparing himself to Rodriguez by noting that she was also now part machine. Rodriguez, however, noted that she was not part machine where it had mattered and furiously fought back against the arrogant Superior, with Superior knocking Rodriguez onto the ground and noting that he no longer felt pain as he had already died dozens of times, noting Rodriguez would not get the same second chances, as he got if she was killed, before furiously attacking her again.

Superior's true robotic implants are revealed
However, Rodriguez refused to give up the fight, fighting back with all her S.H.I.E.L.D. training, despite no longer actually being able to use her Inhuman power but with her new enhanced strength from her two Prosthetic Arms, as she had managed to push Superior away before then picking up one of his discarded knives from the floor and began slashing back at him. With Superior now on the defense, Rodriguez proceeded to use this to her advantage as she pushed him down the facility's corridors, before managing to slice open his chest, revealing the Life-Model Decoy implants hidden underneath his own skin.

Superior getting defeated by Yo-Yo Rodriguez
Seeing his weakness exposed, Rodriguez commented that Superior was still part machine before she then grabbed ahold of his head and furiously pushed Superior out of the nearby window, as they both fell several floors down to the ground. Upon landing, Superior died on impact when his skull smashed against the concrete while Rodriguez was only mildly injured due to using Superior's body to cushion their fall. Superior's death resulted in all of the nearby Sleeper Mechs then also shutting down, as their controller was no longer active, allowing Fitz and Simmons to survive their shootout against the robots.

Personality
As a young boy, he greatly admired his abusive father because he worked hard for what he earned. But all of this was lost upon seeing him sucking up to a wealthy man who inherited his fortune. This gave him a sense of just that people would work for what they want to achieve and it should never be given to them. This could be one of the reasons why he views Inhumans in a hateful perspective and even thinks of them as abominations, calling them genetic cheaters because they inherited their abilities.

Initially, Ivanov despised robots and androids of all kinds, viewing them as mere machines which were fallible and would never best human beings, who he considered to be superior machines. However, when he himself was turned into a set of Life-Model Decoys controlled by his human severed head so he could survive, Ivanov's views on the matter changed and he eventually considered this new way of living a solution to achieve immense strength and immortality, and thus to remain what he called a "superior man."

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Ivanov's new robotic body being built
Android Physiology: Ivanov has control over various of his own Life-Model Decoy duplicates, all of which are remotely controlled by his own human brain and through which he can experience perception. When Ivanov lost access to the machinery to build more identical robot bodies of himself, he resorted to controlling Sleeper Mechs, which worked in the same way, but did not have his face or voice while the Mechs all worked as General Hale's personal bodyguards and enforcers.
Quantum Brain: Like all the LMDs built after Aida, Ivanov was powered and animated by a Quantum Brain, a replica of a human brain which displays the same complexity and capabilities than its biological counterpart but is only made of light.
Hive Mind System: Ivanov's crippled body was experimented on by Aida and managed to keep his own biological brain alive inside a device created with knowledge derived from the ancient book of spells called the Darkhold. It also gave Ivanov remote control over all of his robotic duplicates.
Enhanced Strength: Aida commented on him having superior physical strength than that of a normal human being. All of his Life-Model Decoys have enhanced strength, as demonstrated when his duplicates fiercely fought Coulson and May, despite being highly trained agents, and was on par with Ghost Rider, despite being even, in brute strength. She was also able to use her superior strength to throw a knife at Quake, managing to pierce her and also had enough strength to collide with Yo-Yo Rodriguez, despite her having prosthetic arms and used S.H.I.E.L.D. to dodge her attacks.
Enhanched Durability: Being an android, Ivanov's body is much more resilient than a normal human being and his synthetic nervous system prevents him from feeling pain, as demonstrated when Coulson and May repeatedly shot him and hit him in the face many times, but he got up again. on his feet and kept fighting and his android body allowed him to withstand even the blows of Yo-Yo Rodriguez' Prosthetic Arms, not feeling the pain. Despite the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. they kept killing his bodies, he could create new bodies with his brain, making it almost indestructible for them. However, he was vulnerable if there were any delicate parts where his enemies could take advantage, such as when Coulson cut off his face with his projection shield, or when the latter dropped an electric wire at his feet where it was. the water, electrocuting him. He was also vulnerable to fire when Ghost Rider burned one of his bodies, reducing it to ashes. His durability did not allow him to survive the fall by Yo-Yo Rodriguez, when he violently banged his head, causing his eventual death.
Enhanched Reflexes: Being an android, Ivanov possessed the sharp reflexes of a normal human being, allowing him to dodge Coulson and May's attacks and continuing to fight them until he defeated them and his reflexes allowed him to compete with Yo-Yo Rodriguez, even though he had his own prosthetic arms.
Longevity: Although it has never been proven, because he was killed at the hands of Yo-Yo Rodriguez, Ivanov commented that his android body was made to last, giving him a form of immortality he never dreamed of. This showed that he had lost his ability to age, being trapped for eternity at the age he died in 2017 and his life could have lasted for many thousands of years. He was also immune to biological diseases, although he is susceptible to computer viruses, despite never having been discovered.

Abilities
Superior furiously fights back against Quake
Expert Combatant: As a former member of the SVR, Superior is highly trained in multiple fighting styles.  While leading the Watchdogs, he trained himself to be a fierce combatant, being able to go fight Quake, Ghost Rider and Melinda May.
Knife Mastery: Superior demonstrates great skill in the use of knives both as close quarters blades and as thrown projectiles.
Expert Tactician: Upon learning of the new Inhuman Outbreak, Superior was disgusted by the notion of Inhumans gaining power they did not earn and he led the Watchdogs, becoming the Superior in the process, and leading the entire organization from the shadows. As part of his mission to wipe out the Inhumans, Superior organized many missions against the Inhumans, including the Blackout Attack which was thwarted by S.H.I.E.L.D..
Bilingualism: Superior is fluent in his native Russian, as well as in English.
Equipment
Weapons
Superior's Knives: Ivanov carries an arsenal of knives, which he uses as both a close quarters weapon and as a projectile. He used several of these to torture Jeffrey Mace, and he utilized them again to great effect in combat with the Inhuman Quake, succeeding in injuring the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.
Superior attempting to shoot Melinda May
Makarov PM: Ivanov carried this handgun in his Life-Model Decoy body, and drew it in an attempt to execute a Melinda May while she was connected to Framework. However, he was unable to fire due to parameters set by Aida, that required her to be protected. As soon as the restrictions were lifted, he went to attack Phil Coulson, and was about to shoot him in the face, but Coulson destroyed the LMD with his Energy Shield.
AKM: The SVR unit that Ivanov belonged to carried these assault rifles when they were sent to retrieve the item found at the Burkov Mining Facility. They held Phil Coulson at gunpoint, who had infiltrated the facility under the excuse of working for the United Nations, and then used them when Melinda May went to rescue him, unable to prevent her from doing so.
I.C.E.R.: During his second encounter with Phil Coulson, the Superior was able to ambush and disarm him, before he took away his I.C.E.R., which he then proceeded to dismantle and throw aside.
Other Equipment
Superior looks closely at a Terrigen Crystal
Terrigen Crystals: Through his work with Holden Radcliffe, the Superior had been supplied with his cases of Terrigen Crystals, which Radcliffe had previously obtained from Hive. As he had observed all these Crystals for himself, the Superior had then given one to Tucker Shockley, in order for them to test if Ellen Nadeer was an Inhuman, like her own brother had been.
Darkhold: The Superior had become convinced by Radcliffe to kidnap Billy Koenig, so that they could then obtain the current location of the Darkhold, which Radcliffe had promised could help the Watchdogs to destroy the Inhumans. Once he gained the Darkhold, the Superior would often read from it, much to Radcliffe's annoyance, as the Superior also noted that the book contained some amusing passages. While he had continued to work with Aida to eliminate the Inhumans, the Superior attempted to convince Glenn Talbot to read the book and follow it's teachings, only to lose it when S.H.I.E.L.D. had then arrived and caused a firefight.
Framework Headset: Following his near death experience at the hands of Quake, the Superior's head had been removed by Aida and placed inside of a jar, where it was also given one of the Framework Headsets, allowing the Superior to gain control of several Life-Model Decoy bodies of himself, which he could control simultaneously, using his brain power from within the jar.
Sleeper Mechs: Following the demise of Aida, the Superior had been unable to continue making any more realistic Life-Model Decoys of himself, so he was forced to turn to Hale, who provided him with an army of Sleeper Mechs, which he could continue to control remotely. The Superior used these Mechs on numerous missions with Ruby Hale, as well as them being used as bodyguards, until his demise, at which point all the Mechs shut down.

Trivia
In the comics, Anton is the seventh person who wears the mantle of the Red Guardian, the Soviet counterpart of Captain America. Unbeknownst to anyone, Anton is actually a Life-Model Decoy, and after he was decapitated by an alien, his head was kept alive in storage. Meanwhile, the Superior is the alias of Jonathan Gallagher, a powerful intelligence figure and head of the organization known as the Bridge.
In The Return, Ivanov refers to his new LMD form as something "designed only for killing", a subtle allusion to Marvel supervillain M.O.D.O.K. (Mental/Mobile/Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing).
Ivanov is a fan of The Moody Blues.
Behind the Scenes
Nicholas Verdi was a stunt double for Zach McGowan in the role of the Superior.
