<html><p>As they walked into the next room, They started to become prepared for Pop's funeral. Fish pointed out that Cage's popularity had now increased, noting the amounts of letters stacked on the front door. Fish noted that going to the funeral may be the hardest thing. After Cage and Fish admired Pop's past life, Fish gave Cage the key to Pop's apartment upstairs, noting he would have wanted him to have it, since Genghis Connie's blew up. Cage reluctantly took the key, stating that he will find a way to earn his keep, with Fish agreeing, stating that they need to keep the shop up and running.

Cage is approached by Aisha Axton
Suddenly, they were visited by Aisha Axton, who demanded to see Cage. She asked him about Zip and his thieving, curious, Cage asked what she meant, she answered that Zip and his crew had been going around Harlem and had stolen her father's ring and hit a few other people, putting the blame on him, claiming it was the Luke Cage Stupidity tax being put upon them. Axton begged to get the ring back, noting that it was the only thing to remember her father's good days by. Cage was hesitant, but Axton furiously told him to stand up, noting what happened at Genghis Connie's. 

Cage searches for Zip and his henchmen
As she left, Fish took note that it was probably Cottonmouth trying to get Cage driven out by all of Harlem and turn the people of the city against him so Cottonmouth could continue with all of his criminal activities. As Cage began to leave, Fish asked what he was doing, Cage answered that he would clear his name. As Cage left Pop's Barber Shop, he was approached by more of the victims of Zip and his crew, demanding that Cage get back the items that they stole. Cage stated that he was on it and left, beginning his search for Zip and the other criminals to stop their activities now.

Cage gets back all the items from Zip's crew
Cage started fighting Zip's crew, reclaiming all the stolen objects back to their original owners. As soon as he stopped some more thugs, he showed his strength before he threatened to come after them if the so much as say his name ever again and then demanded that they tell everyone that they should no longer fear Cottonmouth. He then knocked out the thugs with a simple smack around the head. When one of the women he was helping questioned if Cage would need a gun or not, Cage confidently responded that he was the gun before walking straight up to two thugs, knocking one out with slap before threatening and knocking out the second.

Cage finds Sugar wounded on a stretcher
As he walked down the streets of Harlem, he heard a scream. He walked towards the source, seeing Sugar on a stretcher, complaining about someone, who he called a "bitch," shooting him in the leg as he was prepared to go to Metro-General Hospital for treatment. Cage asked if he knew who he was and Sugar recoiled, remembering their earlier encounter where Cage had showed his power to him. When Cage asked who shot him, Sugar just groaned and stated that he was "moving back to Raleigh" and "had enough of this shit" but still refused to answer any of Cage's questions to him.

Aisha Axton's friend approaches Cage
As Cage kept walking, he was approached by another girl who stated he wasn't working fast enough, pleading that he get the ring back for Aisha, who had shot Sugar. She told him the tragic story about her and her father, who got ill and left her alone on the streets. When she stated how tough Aisha was, Cage asked if it was Aisha who shot Sugar, she stated that Sugar mocked her and her father's ring. When he asked where she got the gun and where Aisha was, she stated that she got the gun from her and that she doesn't know her whereabouts. With that, she left Cage alone again.

Cage encounters both Knight and Scarfe
Suddenly, Cage encountered Misty Knight and Rafael Scarfe, much to his annoyance. Knight found it odd that Cage kept showing up at crime scenes and showed him the picture of Reva Connors, refusing to give it to him, as it was evidence. Scarfe then showed Cage the cuffs and tiara from Noah Burstein's lab, asking what his connection with Cottonmouth was. Cage answered that he had gotten angry when Cottonmouth fired him, then Knight told him to back down and let them do their job. Cage told her he would deal with Cottonmouth and then go. Knight told him not to attend Pop's funeral.

Warning Cottonmouth
Cage is surrounded by Cottonmouth's crew
Cage entered Harlem's Paradise to talk to Cottonmouth, but as soon as he got inside, he was greeted by his henchmen who surrounded him. As they inched closer to him, Cottonmouth loomed over him and mocked him for being Harlem's savior. Cage stated that he was ending Cottonmouth's reign, then Cottonmouth told him that he can't have Harlem, to which Cage replied that he didn't want Harlem, but he wanted to protect it from him. Cottonmouth, then, stated that it was his home.

Cage fights all of Cottonmouth's henchmen
The henchmen, including a nervous Amos, then began to fight Cage. However, Cage easily gained the upper hand, knocking out all three of the henchmen. One of them even tried to shoot him, but all the bullets just bounced off of him. Shades recognized his fighting style and, unbeknownst to Cage, figured out that he was really Carl Lucas, recalling their time together at Seagate Prison where he had watched him fight for Albert Rackham, despite having assumed Lucas had been killed years earlier. Cage continued fighting and subdued all of Cottonmouth's men, leaving them rolling around in pain.

Cage mocks all of Cottonmouth's efforts
Enraged, Cottonmouth came down to Cage, but Cage mocked him for using a gun after surviving his rocket launcher attack when he had destroyed Genghis Connie's with him still inside. Cottonmouth threatened war, but Cage stated that all of his men are down and that his mob simply no longer had the strength needed to bring him down, which angered Cottonmouth even further. He mocked Shades, revealing that he actually knew who he was. He, then, threatened Cottonmouth to no longer say his name; Cottonmouth asked why and Cage said nothing and walked out of the club.

Retrieving the Ring
Cage approaches Zip and his small crew
Cage, finally, came across Zip, who was playing craps on the streets with his criminal friends while tacking his break from tormenting the people of Harlem. He mocked them for taking their lunch breaks like normal employees and asked if any of them were at the raid of Crispus Attucks Complex. With that being said, everyone left in fear except Zip, knowing how dangerous Cage could be. As Cage approached Zip who refused to walk away, he began firing his gun at Cage, but the bullets bounced off of him, much to Zip's horror.

Cage demands the ring back from Zip
Zip froze and shook with fear, then Cage took his gun and twisted it in a knot while Zip could only look on with amazement. Cage then, grabbed Zip by the scruff of his neck and lifted him into the air while he demanded Aisha Axton's ring back, but Zip shook his head no and denied all knowledge. Cage told him to think again, noting that the place was named after Jackie Robinson, and reminded him of Robinson's history as he began to choke Zip more, hoping to scare him into stopping his crimes for Cottonmouth. Cage then proceeded to look in Zip's coat pocket where he found Aisha's ring, let Zip go and walked away without another word to the horrified Zip.

Cage approaches Aisha Axton's father
Cage entered the baseball shop, but she wasn't there, finding the place a complete mess. Then, he came across Eddie Axton, Aisha's father, who asked if he was one of the thrives, stating that he has nothing left. Cage told him that he needed to find Aisha to return the ring, but Eddie claimed it wasn't worth anything, But Cage noted that it might have reminded her of better times. Axton talked about his failed Baseball career and how Aisha came up with the shop to set a positive example for himself. Disgusted, Cage told Axton to shape up and to let Aisha know that he had just stopped by.

Pop's Funeral
Cage notices the bullet holes in his shirt
Cage went back to Pop's Barber Shop and took off his coat. He took a look in the broken mirror and saw all of the bullet holes in his shirt that Dapper Dan had given him, which had been caused by Zip's gun. He cursed under his breath and, knowing where he was, put a dollar in the swear jar in tribute to his lost friend's rules about saying swear words.

Cage finally arrives late to Pop's funeral
Cage entered Pop's funeral, listening to Bert Hunter's speech, Pop's long estranged son who talked about his deceased father and his regrets for how their relationship had turned out. As Cage continued to walk through the church, people began to take notice and started to stare at him. Cage took note of Misty Knight and Cottonmouth who were attending along with Shades, and sat down next to Aisha Axton. He told her that the job was taken care of and to take her hand away from her concealed gun that she was considering using against Cottonmouth. She did as Cage crushed her gun.

Cage listens to Cottonmouth's tribute
Once Hunter had finished his speech, Bobby Fish asked if anyone would like to say a few words, as Cage started to get up, he was interrupted by Cottonmouth who went up and began his tribute. He listened to Cottonmouth's own story about how he grew up with Pop while living with Mama Mabel and how Pop got his name from hitting people. Cottonmouth went on to claim that he would protect Harlem from criminals, mentioning that Tone had gone missing ever since shooting up the Barber Shop and killing Pop. The crowd cheered him on, as he finished his tribute and returned to his seat.

Cage gives his passionate tribute to Pop
Cage, then, came up after Cottonmouth, looking at the picture and remembering how Pop died, then began his tribute. He told the people his memories of Pop and the reason why he had a swear jar in his barber shop in the first place, to teach the kids in the store respect and good manners. He told what he think Pop would have wanted, for people to be protected and find the good in them, while using the ring as an example, and telling the people to stand up against criminals. After he was done, he approached Aisha and gave back her father's ring. Aisha asked if he was one of them, Cage responded that he does give a damn and hugged her.

Cage and Misty Knight discuss Harlem
After the service, Cage confronted Cottonmouth, mocking him for trying to get Harlem against him. Cottonmouth laughed and stated that the war was still going on between them, but Cage gave another threat. As he left him, Cage was approached by Misty Knight, who was furious that he got all of Harlem involved with his heroism. She pleaded to let her get Cottonmouth the legal way, but Cage took note that it will all lead to him getting out of jail. Knight took note that now Harlem was vulnerable and that he needed to leave, but Cage stated that he was going nowhere and entered the Barber Shop.

Reunited with a Friend
Cage goes for a jog all around Harlem
Cage went jogging one morning, unknown that Trish Walker still did her own radio segment on Trish Talk dedicated to him and his recent actions within Harlem. One woman thought that Cage was not to be trusted, where as, one man said he knew him personally and that he always meant good. Walker then took note that the only ones complimenting all of Cage's recent actions, were folks that knew him personally, she also gave him her own personal thanks, knowing that he is using his powers for good to help the people of his neighborhood against all the criminals making their lives dangerous.

Cage warns Mariah Dillard that he will stop her
While still jogging through the city, Cage stopped when he caught sight of Mariah Dillard, who was doing an interview for the news about her own work with the New Harlem Renaissance campaign, describing her vision for the future of Harlem. Once the interview was over, he gained her attention. He informed Dillard that once he had shut Cottonmouth's criminal empire down, she would be next along with Harlem's Paradise and everything Mama Mabel and her family had built up over the years. Dillard asked if that was a threat against her, but Cage insisted that it was not and then left to continue his jog while Dillard continued her interview about Harlem.

Cage has some lunch with Bobby Fish
Later, Cage joined Bobby Fish at a local diner, where they discussed how they would be able to keep Pop's Barber Shop open in Harlem in order to honor Pop's memory within the community, with Cage noting that he intended to leave once Cottonmouth was arrested. Fish continued pushing Cage into becoming a hero, suggesting that he could wear a mask to hide his identity, and if not then he should play professional football. Cage, however, insisted that he was not a hero, so Fish joked that could be his tag line: I am no hero, pay me. The two men chuckled and continued to eat their meal.

Cage is surprisingly greeted by Claire Temple
While still eating with Fist, Cage was greeted by Claire Temple, who had been speaking with her own mother Soledad Temple. Seeing that Cage was still unsure who she was, Temple then reminded him of how Jessica Jones brought him to Metro-General Hospital in the wake of their fight against Kilgrave, at which point Cage clicked and happily greeted Temple despite clearly not recalling her name. Fish then introduced himself Temple, complimented her beauty and left the two of them alone. Cage offered her a seat, which she accepted, causing awkward silence between the two of them.

Cage and Claire Temple discuss his powers
Cage started the conversation, claiming that Temple didn't have to do what she did for him back at Jones' Apartment in saving his life; however, Temple told him that all she wanted to know was whether he was okay or not after the Duel of Delaney Hall. As Temple claimed that saving someone's life meant worrying about them later on, she went on to remind him of the shotgun blast that Jones fired into his head which should have destroyed his skull and began questioning how it was even possible that he had survived it. Cage asked if she thought he was a freak due to his superhuman abilities, but Temple stated that she now thought he was amazing for them.

Cage leaves Claire Temple alone at the diner
Cage, however, stated that he wants to be normal, just like everyone else, but Temple asked why he should hide his gifts if he was never going to use them, noting that she believed that he could use his unbreakable skin and superhuman strength to do great things all across New York City, not just in Harlem, just like Daredevil and the other heroes in the world. Hearing this idea from Temple, Cage then paused and paid for his meal, apologizing to Temple while claiming that he had to be somewhere and left. Temple, however, followed closely behind him, not giving up on making him a hero.

Scarfe's Evidence
Cage discovers Rafael Scarfe bleeding out
As Cage walked back to Pop's Barber Shop, with Claire Temple still following behind him, Cage continued explaining to her that the real reason that he had gone into New York City was to remain hidden. However, Temple noted that surviving a fallen building and surviving bullets would cause a lot of attention. When Cage opened the door to the Barber Shop, he was surprised to find the door unlocked. He and Temple followed a trail of blood and found Detective Rafael Scarfe bleeding on the floor where he was waiting for Cage.

Cage questions why Scarfe needs his help
Scarfe demanded no cops, not even Misty Knight, when Cage asked why he wanted his help and Scarfe claimed it was because he didn't trust anyone within the New York City Police Department. Just as Temple suggested taking Scarfe to a hospital, he refused, claiming he would get killed by those who were targeting him, stating just like how they found Chico Diaz. Despite just learning that Diaz had been killed, Cage then helped Temple move Scarfe from the floor onto one of the barber chairs, where Temple began to operate to remove the bullets lodged in Scarfe's body which were killing him. 

Cage demands all the truth from Scarfe
They continued to heal Scarfe, as he still laid bleeding on the barber chair. Temple then revealed that removing the bullet on Scarfe's side could cause major internal bleeding. Cage, still not trusting of Scarfe, asked why he should not just simply turn him over to the police; but Scarfe simply stated that they were trying to kill him. Scarfe then requested to lay low at the Barber Shop, but Cage demanded the truth about Scarfe's predicament. Scarfe, under a lot of pain from the bullet wounds, finally revealed that it was Cottonmouth after working for him and giving him Shameek Smith's stolen guns.

Cage furiously threatens Rafael Scarfe's life
When Cage asked why he thinks he is qualified to protect Scarfe, he took note of him surviving both the Attack on Pop's Barber Shop and also the Destruction of Genghis Connie's. Cage however noted that he mentioned Diaz's name when he passed out, demanding to know what happened to him; after he hesitated a bit, he revealed that he killed him as ordered by Cottonmouth. Cage, enraged, then began to choke Scarfe. However, Temple convinced Cage that he was not a killer, as he took his hand off of his neck and decided to leave Scarfe to bleed to death from the gunshots in the Barber Shop.

Cage learns of evidence against Cottonmouth
However, while Cage and Temple went to leave, Scarfe begged for his protection, noting that he was indeed corrupt, but he insisted that Cottonmouth was worse and he had evidence that could put him to jail for all of his crimes against Harlem. This caused them to stop as Scarfe revealed that in his Apartment, he had kept notes about every crime that was covered up by Cottonmouth's orders, as well as all of the bodies disposed of at Joel Spurlock's, which included Tone and Diaz, as well as the names of every cop who was on Cottonmouth's payroll. With that, Cage then left for Scarfe's apartment.

Cage walks into Rafael Scarfe's Apartment
Leaving him inside the Barber Shop with Temple, Cage soon found Scarfe's apartment, unaware both that Detective Misty Knight and Lieutenant Perez were still keeping their eyes on the place. As he approached the door, he unlocked it by breaking the knob and then running up to his room without being seen by anyone else in the building. As Cage then searched everywhere throughout Scarfe's Apartment, but he eventually found the notes hidden underneath the floorboards relating to Cornell Stokes many crimes of which Scarfe had been involved with throughout all of the many years.

Cage escapes from Detective Misty Knight
As he looked through them, Cage heard Dogs barking and footsteps charging up the stairs as Knight and Perez ran up to investigate what was happening. With little time left to get away, Cage then jumped out the window all the way down to the ground of New York City and proceeded to run to the sound of Knight's voice calling out for him as she watched as an unbreakable man ran away from an impossible to survive drop. With the information he had, Cage then made his way back towards the Barbers Shop to confront Scarfe and make a plan for finally arresting Cottonmouth once and for all.

Protecting Scarfe
Cage gives another update to Rafael Scarfe
Cage returned to Pop's Barber Shop where he informed the nearly unconscious Rafael Scarfe and Claire Temple that since his search for the evidence, now Detective Misty Knight had found out that he was in the apartment and they would be coming to the shop very soon to arrest them all. Cage stated that he would need to carry Scarfe somewhere where evidence would matter and began to leave to hail a cab; however, Temple suggested her mother's company van to take them there as it was arriving.

Cage is given the van by Soledad Temple
Cage, then, carried Scarfe to the Van, which was waiting in the back. Much to his dissatisfaction with the vehicle, he was approached by Temple's mother, who demanded her daughter comes back safe under the threat of death. Cage guaranteed it, as he put Scarfe in the back, with Temple, and began to drive through New York City to get Scarfe to safety. Temple noted that Scarfe was bleeding violently and needed surgery, however, Cage revealed that he was taking Scarfe to the nearest police precinct, to drop him off and the evidence, stating that D.A. Blake Tower could then take care of the rest.

Cage drives Detective Rafael Scarfe to saftey
When Scarfe noted that he should go to Metro-General Hospital, Cage stated that due to much of the New York City Police Department being under Cottonmouth's payroll, that would make him an easy target. Much to Cage's frustration, he found traffic unusually congested. Cage guessed that Cottonmouth closed off the streets to find Scarfe. Temple suggested a sharp right on the next street, as a shortcut; Cage did that, unaware that they were being followed by Zip's people who began shooting. Cage drove the van through the backstreets before hiding and punching into a building.

Cage faces off against Cottonmouth's goons
Cage, Temple and Scarfe walked down a long hallway in the building they were in, trying to find the police headquarters, while Scarfe had begun complaining of feeling the cold due to his near fatal injuries. However, gunfire sprayed Cage's back and he shielded Temple and Scarfe from harm, leaving Temple and Scarfe to continue moving forward while he stayed behind and blocked the path. As their guns had failed to work, one man shot out a tear gas canister, but that only agitated Cage, as he walked towards the thugs, brushing off all their bullets before he then knocked them out one by one.

Cage stops a moving van with his own body
As soon as he was finished taking out Cottonmouth's thugs, Cage then went back outside in the nick of time, to stop a van from running over Temple and Scarfe, allowing the van to slam into his own body as it was stopped in its tracks while Cage remained unharmed. He was met by Detective Misty Knight, who ran to see Scarfe just as Scarfe began to convulse, as Temple laid him on the ground to give him some comfort. Knight held onto Scarfe's hands, who apologized for all of his misdeeds, including killing Chico Diaz and then died, as Knight began to weep for her fallen partner and friend.

Cage spends time and flirts with Claire Temple
While Cottonmouth was arrested by Knight, Cage and Temple spent the rest of the night walking down the streets of Harlem. Temple took note that Cage was able to do all of the extraordinary things he did earlier and was in disbelief that he doesn't think that he was special; Cage simply replied that he doesn't know what he was, but Temple stated that he should know. Cage stated that with Cottonmouth in jail, he is done. Temple stated that she was willing to help him use his powers for good, Cage then asked if she would like to go out for a cup of coffee, but Temple rejected all Cage's flirting.

Failure of the Law
Cage breaks up Zip's crew's weapons deal
Filled with confidence since his victory, Cage tracked down a gun deal run by Zip and interrupted it, giving everyone there a casual warning before laughing as they ran away in fear. While Cage began bending the guns in half with his bare hands, Zip informed him that Cottonmouth was in fact getting free and therefore Cage's actions and Rafael Scarfe's death had seemingly meant nothing. Cage considered this and what he was going to do next while Zip ran away from him before he could be arrested.

Cage watches as Cottonmouth walks free
Cage walked to the 29th Precinct Police Station just in time to watch as Cottonmouth walked free having just been freed by his lawyer Benjamin Donovan. Cage watched as Cottonmouth got into his car and prepared to leave to return to Harlem's Paradise, as the enemies briefly locked eyes with one another, with Cottonmouth smiling at Cage before departing the scene. Cage looked across the street and saw Misty Knight, looking equally disappointed to see Cottonmouth going free despite her partner's death at his hands, while Cage then walked away to consider his next move against Cottonmouth.

Cage discusses the failure of law enforcement
Returning to Pop's Barber Shop, Cage was greeted by Bobby Fish who questioned how Cottonmouth had walked free despite all of the evidence against him, with Cage noting that Scarfe's statement was not enough and they could not even convict him for Joel Spurlock's body removals as Spurlock would be going to jail without naming Cottonmouth. They were then joined by Claire Temple who told Cage that he should not give up on trying to send Cottonmouth to jail, leading to Cage questioning why it had become his responsibility to solve all of the problems which were involving Cottonmouth.

Cage speaks to Cottonmouth on the phone
Temple noted Cage had the power to stop Cottonmouth, comparing his actions to those of Daredevil who had taken down Wilson Fisk. Temple told Cage to get justice himself, noting that he could not be hurt: Therefore, he should not be afraid of Cottonmouth. They were then interrupted by the phone ringing, which Fish got up to answer, telling Cage that it was in fact Cottonmouth on the other end. Taking the call, Cage was invited to Harlem's Paradise to make their peace before more violence, which Cage accepted, despite Cottonmouth insulting him by noting his previous job as a dishwasher.

Cottonmouth's Bribe
Cage has a private meeting with Cottonmouth
Cage arrived at Harlem's Paradise where he found Cottonmouth was playing a tune on the keyboard, which Cage complimented as he noted that Cottonmouth clearly had talent. Cage noted that this was the first time he had seen him without Zip or other bodyguards, so Cottonmouth invited Cage to kill him, which he refused as he noted he was not a murderer. Cage expressed he wish for Cottonmouth to confess his crimes to Detective Misty Knight and go to jail, which Cottonmouth had refused to do, noting that Cage was no longer a sheriff, making it clear that he now knew of Cage's past life as Carl Lucas, much to Cage's utter horror.

Cage's secret is threatened by Cottonmouth
Cottonmouth proceeded to mock Cage's original name, before then noting that if Cage's past was exposed then he would be sent back to Seagate Prison to continue his sentence. Cage tried to argue that Cottonmouth would never snitch, but Cottonmouth claimed that this rule of honor did not apply to Cage. While Cage still remained silent, Cottonmouth compared him to Captain America due to his actions around Harlem, but claimed he was no better than a criminal like him, despite Cage insisting that he was innocent of the crimes he went to jail for, which Cottonmouth proceeded to merely laugh at.

Cage considers all Cottonmouth's threats
Having Cage now at his mercy, Cottonmouth told him that he still had use for bulletproof men and therefore he intended to use Cage as his own hired goon, vowing that if Cage dared step out of line, then he would have him sent back to Seagate Prison where he would then be charged for Albert Rackham's death as well as his escape. Cottonmouth then dismissed Cage from his office as Cage walked away through the streets of New York City considering what actions he would now take as his previous life was now in serious danger of being exposed to the world and his life being finished.

Cage is forced to consider leaving Harlem
Cage quickly returned to Pop's Barber Shop where he packed his bags and prepared to once again go into hiding to avoid his past catching up on him. As he was packing, Cage was confronted by Claire Temple who demanded to know what was happening, before telling him that if he ran away now then he would spend the rest of his life running. Cage, however, noted that him not running had still resulted in the death of Pop and the attack on Connie Lin, claiming he was no good. Temple, however, argued that Cage had a chance to bring down Cottonmouth and inspire the people of Harlem.

Cage gets some advice from Dave Griffith
Walking down Harlem, Cage encountered Dave Griffith who was selling footage of the Battle of New York and clips of the Avengers, although Griffith was still excited at the concept of filming footage involving Cage demonstrating his powers, which Cage refused to get involved with. Cage however, noted that Griffith knew of most things that were happening in the criminal world of Harlem and requested that he point him in the direction of Domingo Colon, the man who had bought the guns from Cottonmouth which Cage's own friends, including Chico Diaz and Shameek Smith had died for.

Cage vs Colon
Cage is shot at by Domingo Colon's men
Using the new information provided by Dave Griffith, Cage arrived inside Colon's Gym where he then personally confronted the clearly surprised and heavily protected Domingo Colon. Cage used his own super human strength to easily subdue many of Colon's bodyguards before the last few aimed their guns at him, which Cage merely scoffed at. Cage allowed the men to shoot him multiple times before then noting how much he hated buying new clothes after being shot, and then throwing all the men across the gym with ease.

Cage demands the Hammer Industries guns
With Colon now defenseless, Cage then cornered him in his office and then demanded the Hammer Industries guns that Colon had paid for from Cottonmouth and that Chico Diaz and Shameek Smith died for. Despite Cage being clear about what guns he had wanted, Colon still denied all knowledge of the guns, leading to Cage then threatening to throw Colon in the Hudson River if he did not comply, until Colon finally handed over the guns which had been designed by Justin Hammer, much to Cage's delight as he even took away a new hoody from Colon on his way out of the door of his gym.

Cage hands all the guns over to Misty Knight
Cage then walked back to the 29th Precinct Police Station where he was greeted by Detective Misty Knight who complimented Cage on his new hoody. Knight noted how Cage was full of surprises which worried her, due to her knowing almost nothing about his own past. Knight questioned why Rafael Scarfe had gone to Cage for his help before Cage pointed her to all the Hammer Industries guns he had recovered and hidden in a van. Cage promised that he was preparing to bring down Cottonmouth, telling her to be ready when he made his move, although Cage refused to hand over a statement.

Diamondback's Revenge
Twisted Family Reunion
Cage goes for a walk alongside Claire Temple
Cage and Claire Temple took a walk for a while as they discussed Cage's outfit the day he escaped from Seagate Prison before Temple asked about Cage's father who Cage admitted did not know he was still alive, claiming that his father viewed him as a shame upon their family. Cage explained that his father had not wished to raise up a criminal son so was ashamed when Cage had been sent to Seagate Prison, despite Temple pointing out it had not been his fault, noting that his father would likely be proud of the man Cage had become since gaining his powers. Cage then told Temple that he was done running and warned her about staying near him as a result due to the vast number of people who were already getting hurt.

Cage is shot in the chest with a Judas Bullet
As Temple thanked Cage for telling his life story and recommended Matt Murdock to be Cage's lawyer, discreetly, Diamondback was hiding far away, watching closely. He took aim with his sniper and the Judas Bullet and fired a single shot, hitting Cage in the stomach and penetrating his seemingly unbreakable skin. Feeling the impact of the bullet, Cage placed his hand on his stomach and felt all the blood dripping out before he fell to the ground and clutched the wound in agony while Temple attempted to help him. While Temple tried to stop the bleeding, Cage briefly caught sight of the shooter.

Cage is rushed to the hospital while bleeding
Due to the wound, Cage went into shock and lost consciousness and awoke in an ambulance on it's way to Metro-General Hospital, with Temple still caring for the gunshot wound and noting she had called Manny for aid. Although Cage insisted that he could not be on the hospital's systems due to being exposed, Temple assured him he would not be while she forced him to drink to keep from getting dehydrated. While Temple and Cage discussed how he could have been shot and if the bullet was inside him, Diamondback followed them from behind and shot their van, causing it to roll over.

Cage realizes that Willis Stryker is his attacker
Dragging themselves out of the crashed ambulance, both Cage and Temple then hid behind a car while Diamondback followed closely behind with his Hammer Industries weapons. Much to Cage's shock, Diamondback called out to him by quoting The Warriors, causing him to realize that he was being chased by Willis Stryker, as Stryker even called him by his original name why telling him to come out and play. While Cage and Temple remained hidden, Diamondback continued threatening them until he escaped after hearing a police siren, telling Cage to keep on running while he chased them down.

Cage's wound is treated by Claire Temple
They both went to a Harlem Women's Clinic where Temple attempted to remove the bullet from Cage's stomach, causing him great pain whenever she touched the wound although he still refused any painkillers out of fear his that mind would then be compromised when Diamondback showed back up. They found that Cage's soft tissue skin was as unbreakable as the outside layer, making it impossible to get to the bullet. Using an ultrasound, Temple discovered that the bullet had exploded inside him and the shrapnel was moving slowly inwards. Temple promised to figure it out, reminding Cage of how she saved him when Jessica Jones had also shot him.

Cage learns that Cottonmouth is dead
Cage's phone rang so Temple answered it, finding Misty Knight on the other end demanding that Cage come into the police station, explaining that Cottonmouth was dead and they needed to take a statement as a witness had placed him at the scene. Noting that Knight was trying to trace the call, Temple hung up. While Temple tested Cage's blood, noting that his powers healed him and trapped the shrapnel at the same time, Knight then appeared, surprised to see Cage wounded. When Knight was called by Mark Bailey, she informed Cage that he was under arrest for the murder of Cottonmouth.

Cage comes face to face with Diamondback
Temple then noticed that Diamondback had reappeared and was taking aim at Cage, ordering him to get down as they took cover and avoided another Judas Bullet, which exploded into the wall. While Knight fired back and went to investigate, Cage and Temple were attacked, with Temple stabbing Diamondback in the arm while Cage threw him through the window and looked his former friend in the eye. Diamondback used Cage's brief pause to knee him in his gunshot wound, forcing Cage onto his knees from the pain before Cage threw Diamondback through yet another window.

Cage rushes to help Detective Misty Knight
Having discovered his gun was out of Judas Bullets, Diamondback struck Cage multiple times in his gunshot wound, knocking him down before Diamondback then turned around to leave. On his way out, Diamondback then took Knight as his hostage, shooting Cage in the stomach before making his escape. Cage had Temple help him back to his feet as he discovered Knight had been left alive but knocked unconscious outside the building while Diamondback had escaped through New York City. Leaving Temple to care for Knight's wounds, Cage went after Diamondback to end their fight.

Duel at the United Palace Theatre
Cage searches for Diamondback in a theatre
Cage entered the empty United Palace Theatre, having found blood on the door handle, and began looking for Diamondback inside. There, Diamondback continued taunting Cage, quoting bible verses and pointing out that Cage was unable to sort out their relationship as he could not fix his mother destroying her life as well as their own issues with prison. Cage continued making his way through the theatre, trying to track down Diamondback there, listening to all of his taunts.

Cage is challenged by Diamondback
Finding Diamondback on the platform above him, Cage confronted his friend about the attempt on his life. Diamondback discussed Cage's father's disdain for him as they came face to face, with Cage comparing Diamondback to Cottonmouth. Despite Cage admitting he was not a good friend to him, Diamondback ignored him and called Cage a false idol to the people of Harlem. Diamondback then cruelly began mocking Cage about his hellish time in Seagate Penitentiary and the death of  Reva Connors which enraged Cage, demanding that Diamondback keep Connors' name out of his mouth.

Cage has his fight against Diamondback
As Cage claimed that Willis Stryker had ruined his life, Diamondback claimed that he had sent Cage to hell and been disappointed that he had returned with superpowers. Diamondback then attempted to shoot Cage again with the Judas Bullet but Cage managed to dodge it and destroy the platform on which Diamondback was standing on top of, causing him to fall down to Cage's level. Getting back up the two friends fought a brutal battle with Diamondback taking advantage of Cage's wound to best him, kicking him in the stomach repeatedly until Cage was able to endure that kind of attack from him.

Cage overpowers and defeats Diamondback
Cage managed to summon enough strength to flip Diamondback over, but this caused Cage to fall back to his knees. Diamondback continued to take advantage of Cage's weakness, as he picked up a steel pipe and repeatedly struck Cage with it, smiling as he mocked the fact that the seemingly indestructible Cage was now bleeding. Eventually however, Cage was able to disarm Diamondback, and toss him through the door and sending him flying into a pillar briefly knocking him out before Diamondback got back up and escaped into New York City with Cage following behind him.

Cage learns the truth about Willis Stryker
Cage got out to the street to find Diamondback, having found he had escaped after their duel; however, Cage found himself struggling to even walk to the wound given to him by Diamondback during their first encounter. Finding himself now at a complete disadvantage, Cage was held at gunpoint by Diamondback who aimed one of his Hammer Industries rifles at his enemy, telling him the concept of the weapon he was using that the victim might possibly survive the first blast but would be killed by the second, with Diamondback clearly hoping that this shot would finally be enough to kill Cage.

Cage is shot with another Judas Bullet
As Cage tried to apologize to Diamondback and told him that he loved him like a brother, Diamondback, however, replied to him that they were indeed biological brothers, much to the complete shock of Cage. Before Cage could try and reply to this however, Diamondback then shot Cage in the shoulder with another Judas Bullet, causing him to fall into a garbage truck that drove off with Cage still inside it injured but alive. With another near fatal wound inflicted upon him, Cage lost consciousness as Diamondback allowed the truck he was in to drive away with Cage still inside of it.

Fighting with Cops
Cage walks injured through New York City
Cage eventually woke up inside the truck, still suffering from the pain caused by the two Judas Bullets now lodged in his chest. Despite all the pain he was in, Cage got out as the truck had stopped and then began trying to make his way back to Harlem. Seeking to disguise himself as best he could, Cage went into a dry cleaners shop, picking out a new hoodie to hide himself. While getting changed there, Cage saw a news report by Megan McLaren noting that he was being hunted by the police, much to the fear of Cage.

Cage is stopped by a pair of police officers
As Cage continued making his way through New York City, struggling to walk due to the amount of pain he was in, Cage was suddenly by a pair of New York City Police Department officers who suspected him of being drunk. Cage claimed to be simply going for a walk, but the officers demanded to see his identification regardless, much to the annoyance of Cage who questioned why they needed to see his identification if he was simply walking down the street and minding his own business. Having now been publicly accused of the murder of Cottonmouth and with Cage matching his description the officers asked Cage to immediately remove his hood for them.

Cage protects a cop from the bullets
Correctly identifying him the cops attempted to arrest Cage, drawing their guns and demanding that he get down on the ground. However, Cage refused to go down without a fight, Cage apologized before slapping officer Masterson around the head, knocking him out cold. Seeing the officer Herrera was now about to shoot, Cage protected Masterson with his own body before pushing Herrera through the air where he crashed into his own police car, knocking him out as well, while Cage suffered some pain from his wounds. Cage then moved them onto the street before taking the car and driving away.

Regrouping with Temple
Cage is reunited back with Claire Temple
Having resisted the New York City Police Department attempts to arrest him, Cage managed to locate Claire Temple at her mother's diner. Temple asked who the attacker was as she checked all his wounds while Cage explained that Willis Stryker was his former best friend and that he was now obsessed to kill him. Temple noted that his wounds are getting infected and if left untreated, Cage would die. Cage told Temple that Noah Burstein was the only man who could help him.

Cage considers Willis Stryker's confession
After some convincing by Temple, Cage reluctantly agreed to go and look for Burstein for aid and they took Temple's mother's car to drive to Burstein's address in Georgia. During the journey, Cage's wounds got worse and it was getting harder for him to breath while Temple did her best to calm and reassure him. Cage told her all about what Diamondback told him and revealed that during their fight, Stryker told him that they were brothers as they had shared the same father. Cage refused to accept this as the truth, believing Diamondback was lying to him and in an attempt to get inside Cage's head.

Cage is reunited with Doctor Noah Burstein
Eventually they reached Noah Burstein's House and found him, with Burstein recognized Cage as Carl Lucas, amazed to see him alive after so many years. They brought Cage into his house and put him on a couch as Cage moaned from the pain. Burstein was shocked that Cage survived the experiment at Seagate Prison and that he didn't have any scars on him from the explosion that had killed Albert Rackham and destroyed the entire laboratory all around him. Cage noted that until the night before, his skin had been made completely bulletproof as a direct result of Burstein's experiment.

Cage begs Noah Burstein to save his life
They explained the situation to him as Cage showed the wounds made by the Judas Bullets and Temple noted that it was impossible to cut into his skin to remove the shrapnel. As Burstein explained that he did not have the resources to help, they gave him Reva Connors's drive that he had recovered from Kilgrave. Burstein unlocked it and found all the information of the experiment which would allow him to possibly save Cage's life, amazed that Connors had died to protect it. Cage started to cough blood and he knew his time was swiftly running out as he urged Burstein to find a way to help him.

A Painful Surgery
Cage's wound is looked at by Noah Burstein
Cage was taken into the barn where Noah Burstein had built his own makeshift lab. Cage asked him how he got all of the equipment as Burstein explained that as the authorities had covered Albert Rackham's death, he stole what he could. Cage asked why he was chosen, Burstein answered that it was because of his strength. Cage insisted that Reva Connors told him that she begged him to do it while Burstein noted that Cage was already tapped to the program. Cage was dismayed that Connors hid this.

Cage is horrified by Claire Temple's ideas
Burstein explained that he needed to get a blood sample for his own research, but discovered he could not inject into Cage's skin. Finding an alternative solution, Claire Temple gained the sample Burstein had needed by puncturing Cage's soft tissues down his throat with a needle, something which Cage reluctantly allowed. Having painfully gotten the blood sample, Burstein used to blood and the information from the drive to get an understanding of how to help Cage, noting the experiment was designed in order to aid the United States Army by creating new artificial skin for burn victims.

Cage is told how their experiment will work
While Cage was laid down on a table and his shirt was removed to examine his wounds, Temple and Burstein discussed what had happened to Cage's skin during the experiment at Seagate Prison and exactly how the Judas Bullets were able to penetrate his skin. Burstein explained to Cage that he can remove the shrapnel from his body but, much to Cage's horror, he will need to be placed in hot acid to weaken his skin enough for them to take out the shrapnel and save his life, explaining that he knew Rackham turning up the heat during the experiment is what had made it work.

Cage prepares to undergo the experiment
As they prepared for the procedure, Temple recommended that if the procedure became too painful then he should make a fist to tell them to stop. Seeing that Burstein was out of earshot, Cage questioned if Temple trusted Burstein, to which she insisted that she still did not. Fearing the worst, Cage then told Temple that if anything happened to him, she must make sure that Burstein does not keep a hold of Connors' data, insisting that all the data cannot fall into the wrong hands, noting that he would have the potential to create an army of new unbreakable soldiers who were all just like Cage.

Cage is lowered down into some boiling water
They put a breathing mask on Cage and they slowly lowered the clearly nervous Cage down into the hot acid. When the boiling acid touched his skin, Cage started screaming in utter agony. Fearing his heart would stop, Temple raised him up which Burstein protested as they needed more time to weaken the skin. Burstein lowered Cage back into the acid again, but they were still unable to weaken Cage's skin. Due to the intense pain the acid caused, Cage's heart stopped beating and he lost consciousness, forcing Temple to revive him by throwing a heater in the water and electrocuting Cage.

Cage is finally pulled out of the acid bath
Considering why the experiment was not working, Temple managed to deduce that all they were missing was the heat. In order to weaken Cage's skin, they needed to have the acid boiling, noting that it was Albert Rackham increasing the heat beyond his control that had made the original experiment work. Despite the risk of it killing Cage, Temple and Burstein began heating up the temperature to boiling levels, until Cage's skin weakened enough for Temple. While Cage's vitals went critical, Temple was able to successfully remove all the shrapnel out from his body, finally saving Cage's life.

A Painful Revelation
Cage begins to remove from the experiment
The next morning, Cage woke up after his painful surgery, where he teased Claire Temple by faking amnesia. A moment later, Cage talked to Noah Burstein, as he was ready to get his questions answered. He confronted Burstein about all those who have died because of the experiments he had conducted at Seagate Prison before him but Burstein reasoned that it was worth the price of Immortality, claiming that this research would be hugely beneficial to the United States Army as they could heal wounds or make the soldiers indestructible, with the possibility of curing HIV and cancer in the future, which had made Cage nervous.

Cage and Noah Burstein discuss the tests
Cage asked about if the ones responsible for Burstein's experiments knew he was there with the equipment; however, Burstein assured him that they did not as they barely kept track of him nowadays, an answer that Cage did not believe, claiming that Burstein was too valuable to not keep track of. Burstein then left Cage and Temple alone in the barn as he went back into his home and invited them to take what they wanted from his fridge. Once they were alone, both Temple and Cage agreed that neither of them trusted Burstein at all despite all he had just recently done to save Cage's life.
