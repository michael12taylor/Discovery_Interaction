<html><p>Rand fighting The Golden Tigers
Heading toward a disclosed warehouse, Iron Fist and Wing went with Yang to the meeting. They stood by as Yang negotiated with the Golden Tiger leader. As the negotiation went on, Iron Fist noticed that some activity was happening outside the building. Fearing that the entire meeting was an ambush, Iron Fist called for Wing and Yang to leave the meeting. This sparked hostilities between the two parties and the Golden Tigers attempted to capture them. While Wing made her escape with Yang, Iron Fist held the Golden Tigers at bay. Summoning his powers, he easily defeated his opponents and began interrogating one of the Golden Tigers but learned nothing. When he heard police sirens, Iron Fist made his escape from the warehouse.

Losing the Iron Fist
Discovering Davos' Activities
Reeling from the failed parley, Rand blamed himself for recklessly causing the negotiation to fail. Not giving up, Colleen Wing suggested that they go and speak to Sherry Yang again and hopefully begin another negotiation. Seeing no other options, Rand agreed and went to the Hatchet's compound to speak to them. They were allowed into the Yangsi Gonshi's compound and met with Sherry. They learned that the situation between the two triads has gotten worse and war was inevitable. They further learned that Hai-Qing Yang was not in Hong Kong but was, in fact, bedridden after suffering a stroke.

Rand finds Hai-Qing Yang recovering in bed
Believing that the timing was too coincidental, Rand began asking Sherry more questions but Wing urged him to give them a moment before he angers Sherry. Once outside the meeting room, Rand used the opportunity to sneak into Hai-Qing's bedroom. As he examined him, Rand recognized the marks on his throats. Remembering that it is a technique used in K'un-Lun called Devil's Claw, Rand began asking the now-conscious Hai-Qing for questions. He learned that it was Davos who caused him to have a stroke and that he sought a shipment called Hancock 212. Unfortunately, in his haste, Rand caused Hai-Qing's condition to worsen and when he was discovered by Sherry, he and Wing were thrown out of the compound.

Once outside, Rand told Wing about his discovering and that Davos was involved. Before they could investigate further, they were approached by Misty Knight who wanted to talk to them. Returning back to Chikara Dojo, Knight explained that the cops had been trying to apprehend the triads and that they had undercover cops among the Golden Tigers. The people that Rand saw last night were cops who were attempting to apprehend the Triads. Knight requested that he stopped with his vigilante activities and let the cops deal with the situation. Rand agreed but he also needed to learn about Davos' activities. Once he shared the information about Hancock 212, Knight suggested that this could mean Hancock Transport which was the largest shipping maritime in the world and that the number could be a shipment. While Rand wanted to head out, Knight firmly told him to stay put which Wing agreed. Using an excuse to take a moment, Rand left the dojo without their knowledge.

Heading to the docks and arriving at late evening, Rand found the area filled with corpses of slain men. Rand managed to locate Hancock 212 but found only an unidentifiable corpse with its skin cut off. He was soon joined by Wing and Knight. Once again, Knight urged Rand to stay put and Wing intervened before they got into a scuffle. Wing had a private talk with Rand, while Knight investigates the area. The couple had a brief argument. Wing disapproved of Rand's headstrong behavior and that his action injured a police officer. Rand countered that if he stopped, more people will die. Furthermore, Rand could not believe that Davos was capable of manslaughter and wanted to stop him before he caused more damage. Wing reluctantly allowed Rand to leave the crime scene.

Capture of Iron Fist
Rand is suddenly ambushed by Mary Walker
Heading toward the subway station, Rand called Joy to warn her about Davos. As he continued to pass through the station, Rand was attacked by Mary Walker. Surprised and shocked to discover that Walker was attacking, Rand questioned her intention as she furiously attacked him. Using his hesitation to her advantage, Walker took the chance to inject Rand with a syringe. They continued their battle underneath the metro station. Rand was reluctant to fight someone he considered to be a friend while at the same time trying to defend himself from an unexpected foe. Despite Rand's best attempt, he was ultimately defeated when the drug weakened his senses and allowed Walker to knock him unconscious. Before he was defeated, Rand answered a phone call from Wing and told her about Walker before his opponent destroyed his phone.

Rand being forced to undergo Davos' rituals

Rand was taken to an undisclosed location in the city. Once he regained consciously, Rand saw that Davos has prepared for a ritual. He watched as three women burned a skin with a tattoo of Shou-Lao and then they used Rand's blood to mix it into an ink which they began tattooing on Davos' back. Once the tattoo of a serpent has been tattooed on Davos' back, his former friend approached and used a technique to steal the Iron Fist from Rand.
Captured by Ryhno's Gang
Danny is found by Ryhno's Gang
Next day, Walker, on Davos' order, brought the wounded and unconscious Rand underneath a bridge. After taking a video of him, Walker injected him with adrenaline to wake him up. Disoriented and still gravely injured, Rand began trying to look for him. On the way, he encountered Ryhno's gang who recognized Rand and promptly captured him, believing that they could get a reward by handling him over to the Golden Tigers. Ignoring Rand's plead or not believing his claim of wealth, the gang brought him to their hideout where he remained captured. Rand tried to break the chains but realized that his powers were gone. While the gang tried to contact the triad, Rand's condition kept worsening. While BB tried to treat him, Rand recognized him and asked him to call Wing and tell him where he was. Despite his hesitation, after witnessing Rand's suffering, BB relented and called Wing and informed her about their location.

Misty Knight demands Ryhno's Gang to let Rand go

While in captive, Rand learned that the Golden Tiger leader was killed. Rand attempted to escape but in his weakened state was overpowered by the gang. Pyhno was about to punish him by cutting one of his fingers off when Wing and Knight arrived at the gang's location and saved Rand from the gang. Bringing him back to the dojo, Rand was treated by Bethany who was called by Ward. After some difficulty, Bethany managed to treat his wounds and stabilize Rand's condition.
Attack on Davos
Rand and Meachum confronting by Mary Walker
While Rand recovered from his injuries, Ward informed the group about what he has learned about Walker. He explained that Walker used to be a Special Ops and left on a medical discharged. Knowing that she is connected to Davos, Wing and Knight left the dojo to question Joy, while Ward stayed behind to look after Rand. As Ward watched over him, Rand shared his lamentation of the loss of his power. He explained to Ward that he went out every night to fight criminals and during his nightly patrol he began to feel Shou-Lao and his power. Rand explained that he felt the surge of the power and became addicted to it. Being able to relate due to his meetings with NA and his own problem with addiction, Ward was sympathetic and understanding to Rand's problems. Eventually, Knights and Wing returned back to the dojo with Walker and Joy. Rand was shocked to learn that Joy planned with Davos to steal the Iron Fist.

Rand and his allies began to discussion on how to deal with Davos and his mad crusade against crime in Chinatown. Rand believed that he could still convince his former brother to surrounded and wishes to keep him from being killed. Rand proposed that they figure out a way to get the power back from him using the same ritual done on him. Wing and Knight decided to search for the Crane Sisters who helped Davos with the ritual, while Rand and Ward stayed back in the dojo.

Not long after, Walker broke free from her ties and approached them with a plan to talk to Davos. Despite Ward's protest, Rand agreed to Walker's suggestion and followed her. They headed over to Walker's apartment to get the equipment she needed. While there, Rand learned about Walker's DID condition and that him meeting Mary was an accident. He also learned what triggers Walker's shift into Mary.

Rand and Davos having yet another debate
They arrived at the warehouse where the ritual was conducted. As they waited, Rand learned that Walker had an alternative motive to help Rand which was to kill Davos for Joy. Rand talked to Walker and managed to convince her to let him talk to Davos. Soon after, Davos returned to the warehouse and Rand went to greet him. Rand questioned about Davos' crusade and his reckless murdering of people. Davos countered that what he was doing was justice. Rand criticized him for going against thousand of years of tradition but Davos retorted that Rand was in no right to speak about tradition given that he abandoned K'un-Lun. Rand urged his former friend to stop as the authorities will never understand Davos' action and will kill him. Davos remained determined in his quest, believing that he was helping the city by stopping the Triads from warring. Davos offered Rand a choice to fight alongside him, but Rand refused.

Rand's knee is completely shattered by Davos
At this point, Walker got out of hiding and attacked Davos. She successfully managed to get an opening and inject Davos with a drug. But things turned, when Davos summoned the Iron Fists on both of his fists and caused a shock-wave by slamming the ground. Rand entered into a brief fight with his former friend. Rand managed to fully inject the drugs into Davos but he was quickly knocked to the ground. In retaliation and fury, Davos used his powers to break Rand's right leg before he fell unconscious due to the drug.

Rand is helped by Mary Walker

Walker went to Rand's assistance and provided first aid on Rand's broken leg before calling for an ambulance. Unfortunately, before they could fully capture Davos, it started raining. Combining with the approaching ambulance's light blinking, Walker shifted into her alter, Mary. With no memories of their previous deal and having no desire to follow Walker's wishes, Mary left the scene as Rand pleaded for her to get Davos as he gets taken into the ambulance.
Trained by Colleen Wing
Rand was taken to the hospital and treatment for his broken leg began. Thanks to Rand Enterprises, they provided him with a high-tech compression brace that quickens Rand's recovery and allowed him to start walk with some difficulty. Eventually, Rand was able to leave the hospital and return home to the dojo. Wing and Knight was there when he arrived. They began discussing on how to deal with Davos who was still killing Triads and maintained their plan to remove his powers. Knight told Rand that the ritual needed an ancient bowl and Rand provided the information he learned from Ward that Joy and Davos had been to an auction where they might have gained the bowl. While Knight headed out to talk to Joy, Rand and Knight decided to go to Bayard Community Center to spread the word about Davos.

Returning home after a day in Bayard, Knight returned to the dojo to tell the couple about her discovery. She showed them photos of the ancient scroll that she has taken. Being able to read the Ancient Tibetan, Rand was able to decipher that the scroll is an instruction on how to use the ritual. He also learned about a warning if the ritual is disrupted. After Knight left, Rand asked Wing to help train him and rehabilitate him. Having sworn not to be a teacher again, Wing refused Rand's request, to which, he began training by himself.

Rand training with Colleen Wing
As Rand began training aggressively and sometimes injuring himself in the process, eventually, Wing was convinced to help train him. Before they began their training, Wing warned Rand that she needed to mentally separate herself from him, meaning that she cannot treat him as her boyfriend. Knowing that he has no other option, Rand agreed and Wing began training him. Their training immediately began.

Saving the Hatchets
Motivated and having a trainer to help him improve, Rand began to quickly recover from his broken leg and remaster his skills. As they trained, Wing also advised Rand on how to fight Davos using his patience and exploiting his openings. While recovering from his training, Rand learned more about Wing's family's history. Soon, they received news about the whereabouts of Sherry Yang and the remaining Hatchets. They headed out to get the Hatchets to safety from Davos.

Arriving at their hideout, Rand and Wing convinced the Yang and the surviving Hatchets to flee from Davos. As they made their escape, Rand briefly felt tempted to confront his old friend but listening to Wing's advice convinced him to continue with their escape. Once outside the building, they were confronted by Chen Wu. While Wing confronted Wu, Rand escorted the Hatchets to their escape vehicle. They then went to rejoin Wing and left the scene before Davos could get to them.

Relocating the Hatchets at Bayards, they were soon joined by the surviving Tigers who wishes to form an alliance. Knowing that the Triads will try to hunt down Davos, Rand and Wing tried to convince them to wait and let them execute their own plan. Despite saving them, the Triads refused and the couple was let out of their meetings. Returning back home, Rand and Wing discussed about what happened the previous night and Rand's newfound patience. Rand also talked to Wing about their emotional distance from one another due to recent circumstances. Wing decided to take Rand to where she used to cage fight so they can finally complete Rand's training.

Epiphany
Arriving at the empty fighting ring at night, Colleen Wing prepared the stage for Rand. She told Rand that in order to be able to face Davos, Rand needed to learn how to fight someone he cares about. They will be fighting kumite, a point match where they will each wear three ribbons and the one who rips most ribbons is the winner. The lesson for Rand was to learn how to control his emotions. Despite some hesitation, Rand readied himself for the fight. 

They began their match, as Rand's hesitation to hurt Wing and difficulty focusing allowed Wing to take the lead in the match. As they fought, Wing taunted and challenged Rand about his duty as the Iron Fist, the power of being one and his inability to separate his love for Davos and her. However, Rand was able to focus and quickly turned the tide. However, when Wing asked him what he was fighting for, a realization hit Rand. Even though he won the match, he refused to take off Wing's last remaining ribbon to complete it.

Leaving the fighting ring to cool his head, Rand was joined by Wing soon after. He explained to Wing about his epiphany, having grown up with privileges only to have it all taken away from him, Rand set his goal to become the Iron Fist in order to cope with the trauma. Rand admitted that his desire to fight has not been because of Matt Murdock's final wish or for their neighbor and neither has it been for Davos or Wing. He explained that his only motivation to fight has been to feel the power of the Iron Fist. Realizing that as long as he was addicted to the power and the desire to keep fighting in order to keep feeling it, he could not take back the Iron Fist. Instead, Rand urged for Wing to take the power instead.

Regaining the Iron Fist
Departing New York City
Rand and Ward Meachum ready to search for Orson Randall
Rand returned to the Chikara Dojo to leave Colleen a letter saying that he would be heading to Asia to search for Orson Randall. Danny arrived at his private jet with Ward Meachum waiting for him to try and stop Rand from leaving. Rand asked Meachum to come with him in his journey to find Randall and to be worthy of the Iron Fist. In his journey across Asia, Rand managed to regain the power of the Iron Fist, and was able to manifest them in both hands simultaneously.

Search for Orson Randall
Rand shooting his Chi Guns at the bullet
Months later, Rand and Ward Meachum arrived in a bar in Hokkaido, Japan where Meachum would ask a man about Orson Randall. The man threatened Meachum to which he responded by telling him that he wouldn’t want to mess with Rand. As Meachum left, Rand confronted the man showing his twin guns which startled the man causing him to fire at Rand. Rand stopped the bullet by pulling out two guns and imbuing the bullets with chi, destroying the other man's bullet. Chuckling to himself cockily, Rand told them to not try that again.

Absence from Rand Enterprises
By Spring 2018, Rand's and Ward Meachum's absence from Rand Enterprises had counted against Jeri Hogarth, with Rand Enterprises agreeing to the decision to transfer two-thirds of Hogarth and Associates's legal affiliation over to Hogarth's old law firm, now named Chao & Benowitz.

Personality
Stranded in K'un-Lun for fifteen years, Danny Rand has suppressed his emotions most of his life and trained as a living weapon among his strict teachers at K'un-Lun. This has led him to never fully accept or emotionally vent over his grief surrounding his parents death. Despite obtaining the prestige title of the Iron Fist and his own tremendous martial art abilities, Rand suffers from an identity crisis; whilst he feels bound to his duty to protect and serve K'un-Lun as previous Iron Fist's have done before him and destroy the Hand, Rand also sought to discover who he was outside of K'un-Lun's walls yet leaving without telling his masters and friends plagues his guilt and inner conflict. It's this that occasionally prevents him from unlocking the true power of the Iron Fist. Rand's Survivor's Guilt causes flashes back to the plane crash which causes him to act more reckless, angered and sporadic in blocking the Iron Fist. It is these memory flashes and the constant hostility that he received when trying to convince his former friends of his identity that caused him to become more threatening and unstable. In his fits of frustration, Rand aimed a gun at Ward Meachum after disarming the latter and almost drove both of them off the roof of a parking lot building due to Meachum's hostility.

Being the youngest of the Defenders and never spending a day outside of K'un-Lun in fifteen years, Rand has a childish and immature personality, causing him to be ignorant to how modern society works and incredibly naive. After fifteen years of being thought dead, Rand did not see the illogic that by returning to New York City, shoeless and unshaven, he would have been confused for a homeless or delusional person except after when he was submitted to a mental institution. His only connection to modern day New York are the several locations he knew when he was young, such as the restaurant his father ate at is where he got takeout for Colleen Wing and him. Whilst his youth, lack of intelligence and forethought makes him easy to be manipulated as well his tendency to act on anger or impulse, Rand's innocence is also his greatest strength as Claire Temple noted that, on account of having met people with powers beforehand, he has a heart and kindness that they all lacked.

Despite, or maybe because of his naïveté, Rand is extremely compassionate. He made sure that, even as a factory payload were all being laid off, they were all compensated at great financial loss to Rand Enterprises. Rand had never killed anyone; even though the Order of the Crane Mother expected him to defeat the Hand, he only incapacitated most Hand warriors he thought, willingly surrendered from the Da Jue Zhan in order to save Sabina Bernivig's life even though it would have caused the Hand to fled New York and refused to kill Madame Gao in China even after it was revealed she murdered his parents, though he threatened her life when Colleen was close to death by the Hand's poisoned weapons. In his anger towards the Hand's manipulations, he was motivated to work on killing Bakuto and the Hand. The closest he ever came to truly wanting to murder someone was Harold Meachum over his betrayal and murder of his parents but was eventually saved from this by Ward Meachum killing Harold.

After Matt Murdock's death and the destruction of Midland Circle, Danny decides to honor his fallen comrade by becoming a vigilante like him. He retains his compassion for others as both he and Colleen helped Misty through her physical therapy and provided Luke a place to stay while hiding from Bushmaster. Since then, upon meeting Luke at Pop's, Danny has become far more relaxed, laid-back and mature in personality. He has also displayed far more emotional wisdom and control than before, noting how Luke was at war with himself. He explains that "Stillness is power", stopping to look and understand the situation. He also shown some humility, having both acknowledged his past behavior and the advantage he has by being wealthy. This new emotional development has allowed Danny to properly control and summon the Iron Fist at will, something he wasn't able to do in the past.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Iron Fist summoning chi energy to his fist
Chi Manipulation: Under the tutelage of the Order of the Crane Mother, Danny Rand gain deep knowledge and understanding of chi. After gaining the power of the Iron Fist, Danny Rand can harness his own chi to augment his physical and mental capabilities. Through the use of his chi, Rand is capable of generating an "internal force" that removes the need for charging momentum. The special chi of the Iron Fist bestowed by Shou-Lao also grants Rand many abilities that he has not yet learned, due to him leaving K'un-Lun before his Iron Fist training started.

Iron Fist shatters the ground with his punch
Iron Fist Punch: By channeling the chi of Shou-Lao and focusing it into his hand and wrist, Rand can make his fist superhumanly powerful and resistant to injury and pain. With his fist in this state, Rand can exert superhuman strength and force with which he can smash through steel doors, break out of restraints, and punch his opponents with tremendous concussive force without sustaining injury to himself. When Rand uses the Iron Fist, his fist's density and durability is seemingly on the level of Luke Cage's extremely durable skin, as he can use his fist to deflect bullets and blades while sustaining no harm. He could even injure Luke and send him flying with a single punch to the face. Luke himself described Rand's punching power as hard as a sledgehammer. Using chi in such fashion takes time and effort to build up, meaning he cannot access it effortlessly and at all times, as he is sometimes unable to repeat the act for hours or even an entire day in certain instances due to it draining his own chi. Also, Rand's emotional, mental and physical state are essential to him using his powers, with drugs being able to suppress his abilities and emotional conflict removing his ability to use the fist.
Chi Absorption: Studying the ancient scrolls of the ritual, Danny Rand learned how to absorb chi. While he has not used this technique on anyone yet, he has enough understanding to instruct Colleen Wing on how to use it.
Chi Blast: Danny Rand's fist is able to release powerful waves of concussive force upon impact, sending not only his opponent flying backwards, but all those around them. Rand first used this during his fight with his fellow Defenders, he punched Luke Cage but ended up knocking back everyone in the entire room, including himself. The impact also sent all the objects in the room flying up in the air. He later used this during the fight under Midland Circle, he was able to knock down not just Madame Gao, but all the Hand members around her, with a single blow. With enough effort and motivation,the Iron Fist's chi could also send objects and people flying, as he was able to eject several poison needles the Bride of Nine Spiders from his body, causing them to shoot out in multiple directions and shatter the glass around him. When several Hand operatives where piling around him and Davos, Rand knocked them all off with a forceful shove, some of them he did not even touch while doing so, leaving the men incapacitated.
Chi Sense: By focusing on the living body of another, Danny Rand can feel that person's inherent life force, as well as sense impurities infecting the body. By using this practice, Rand was able to hold his hand and use his chi to sense the poison that was affecting Colleen Wing.
Chi Healing: Danny Rand is capable of healing his wounds by channeling his chi. When a bullet pierced his hand, he was able to regenerate the wound in a matter of seconds by summoning the Iron Fist. Also, by holding his hand over her body, Rand was able to use his chi to burn the poison that was killing Colleen Wing.
Chi Channeling: Danny Rand has the power to channel his chi into his dual pistols, making the bullets glow and aimed directly to other objects in order to destroy them completely.
Rand flips over a speeding taxi
Enhanced Agility: Channeling his chi allows Danny Rand to perform athletic feats that should be impossible for a human, such as effortlessly flipping over a taxi cab, or taking two jumps to get up to a second-story balcony.
Enhanced Stamina: Channeling his chi enhances Danny Rand's resilience and stamina, which allows him to not only not tire from fighting multiple opponents, but also withstand being hit in the back of the head by brass knuckles, which merely left him stunned for a few moments, only being knocked unconscious by falling onto a ledge from two stories and defeating multiple opponents with Davos despite being stabbed in the side by Bakuto. In fact, being struck multiple times with wooden batons allowed him to overcome the effects of drugs used to keep him weak at Birch Psychiatric Hospital and subsequently summon the powers of the Iron Fist that was previously blocked from him by the drugs.
Enhanced Reflexes: Channeling his chi allows Danny Rand to enhance his focus and perception. This allows him to react to danger in mid-combat at a superhuman rate. He was able to react to and easily dodge a bullet, as well as effortlessly, one-handedly block the attacks from one of the Hand's best warriors, without looking.
Empathy: Danny Rand has the ability to sense the emotions of people and animals, and can broadcast his own feelings into others. After breaking into Joy Meachum's home, Rand was able to stop her dog from attacking him by sending his own calm emotions into the dog, causing it to lay down and become uninterested. While helping Luke Cage in his fight against Bushmaster, Rand was able to feel the turmoil in Cage, how he was at war with himself and how it was putting his mind and body off balance.
Abilities
Rand battles against armed thugs
Master Martial Artist: Under Lei Kung's tutelage, Danny Rand has underwent rigorous training in ancient Chinese martial arts since childhood, thus he has exceptional mastery of Kung Fu. His martial arts prowess, combined with his mystical power of the Iron Fist, allows him to overpower most of his enemies effortlessly, shown when he fought three-to-one while wearing a straitjacket. Rand has also demonstrated proficiency with multiple weapons, including swords and nun-chucks. Even without the Iron Fist, Rand is able to take down well trained security guards including a large man taller than him with sheer skill and dexterity. Throughout the series Rand was able to almost effortlessly defeat the Hand's best fighters, as well as Hand leaders, Bakuto and Murakami. During his battles with Davos, Danny proved to be the superior. However, he was outmatched against The Black Sky, having to rely on the Iron Fist to turn the tables.

As such, Rand demonstrated being able to climb and leap onto the second floor of a building and enter the room through the window. He also managed to effortlessly leap over a taxi cab that was seconds away from running him over, to cling to the rafters of Chikara Dojo to hide from Ward Meachum's thugs and to climb and leap over a wall it in a matter of seconds to elude pursuers. His extraordinary athletic prowess is incorporated into fighting style, making full use of his incredible agility to disarm enemies off their firearms and subdue them with lighting quick reflexes giving them no time at all to retaliate.
Expert Businessman: Although Danny is not a very good businessman, he has developed a lot of entrepreneurial learning thanks to the help of the Meachums and their employees. When he had only been with the company for a few days, he made the right decision to close the Rand Enterprises Chemical Plant with the support of New York Bulletin; however, he ended up expelled and being betrayed by Lawrence Wilkins, he has also learned to donate to DEA or finance the creation of Misty Knight's Prosthetic Arm, becoming almost an expert in business.
Meditation: Rand was taught a special meditative technique to recharge his chi and calm his mind, increasing his proficiency in battle.

Equipment
Weapons
Despite being referred to as a "Living Weapon", Danny Rand has shown skill in wielding weapons.

Colleen Wing's Katana: While going through Colleen Wing's possessions in Chikara Dojo, Rand had soon found and practiced with her katana, although Wing insisted that his skills were not good enough. Upon losing the power of the Chi to Davos, Rand was forced to defend himself from Davos' rage with the Katana. He was later given it again by Wing to fight against Davos and Mary Walker, using both the Blade and Scabbard during the clash.
Nunchaku: While showing off his skills, Rand picked up a nunchaku before doing a demonstration with them.
Kimber Pro CDPII: Rand confronted Ward Meachum at a parking lot by forcefully getting into the driver's seat of his car and taking off.

Facilities
Rand at his home residence while as a child
Rand Residence: Rand grew up with his parents in their home within New York City; however, following his parent's death and his own disappearance for years, the house was then sold to Joy Meachum. Once he had returned to New York, Rand briefly visited the house and discovered for himself that Meachum now lived there. Rand made two more visits to the home to try and speak to Meachum, once being turned away and the second time being offered a buyout from Rand Enterprises, which Rand turned down.
Rand Enterprises Building: Rand often spent time playing in the lobby as a child. Upon regaining his name and his position within Rand Enterprises, Rand was given back his father's office in their main building, where he attempted to gain an understanding of how their business worked and used their resources to continue his own investigations into the Hand.
Rand practicing in his new penthouse
Danny Rand's Penthouse: Seeking help to reclaim his name, Rand turned to Jeri Hogarth for legal help, as Hogarth gave Rand a Penthouse to live in while they worked on their case, although Rand struggled to relax there as he missed the floors of K'un-Lun and refused to sleep in his bed. While there with Meachum, Rand witnessed the Yangsi Gonshi attempting to kidnap Meachum, only for Rand to fight them off and save her, later before given Steel Serpent as a clue from the Yangsi Gonshi.
Chikara Dojo: Seeing that Colleen Wing was one of the only people willing to help him, Rand stayed on her floor for several days before moving to his Penthouse. Upon regaining his money, Rand had bought the Dojo in order to ensure that Wing no longer had to worry about paying rent. As their relationship had grown stronger, Rand and Wing converted the Dojo into an apartment for them both, where Rand could then also monitor crime in New York in case he needed to protect innocent lives as the Iron Fist.
Rand Enterprises Chemical Plant: While working for his company, Rand heard of a serious situation from the Chemical Plants which had caused Regina Fitzgerald's son to get cancer, as a result Rand then shut down the Plants until the situation could be resolved.
Red Hook Pier: Rand learned that Ward Meachum had taken over possession of a Pier under the orders of the Hand, which had been previously owned by Raj Patel and would be used by Hai-Qing Yang, who had ordered that Joy Meachum be captured so she would then hand them back control of the Pier. Rand, however, scared Yang off by mention of the Hand before he and Colleen Wing went to the Pier themselves, finding Radovan Bernivig was being kept hostage there as they rescued him from the Hand.
Rand Enterprises Research Facility: When Rand had been contacted by Luke Cage that a situation was unfolding and they needed somewhere to hide out, Rand gave Cage the keys to one of his company's Research Facilities to get away from Bushmaster. However, their fight still took place in which much of the facility was damaged, although Rand was not bothered by this.

Trivia
In the comics Danny Rand is Luke Cage's best friend and the two of them founded "Heroes for Hire", a superhero protection agency.
Danny Rand is mentioned in the non-canon video game Iron Man. While driving A.I.M. forces from a nuclear facility in Russia, Tony Stark tells Pepper Potts to call Rand and tell him he will be able to make it to their scheduled golf game.
Danny Rand is shown to be a fan of hip hop music, including Dr. Dre, Outkast, Camp Lo, Killah Priest, The Cool Kids and Anderson. Paak.
In The Defenders episode The Defenders, Jessica Jones calls Rand "Ironclad" instead of Iron Fist. In the comics, Ironclad is the alias for Micheal Steel. Ironclad also appeared in the non-canon video game The Incredible Hulk.
Behind the Scenes
Prior to the casting of Finn Jones, many people expressed hope that the main role would be portrayed by an East Asian actor even though the comic book character was Caucasian. When the Caucasian actor was cast, the decision was criticized by, among others, Marvel writer Marjorie Liu and actress Chloe Bennet.
Before the casting of Finn Jones, many martial arts actors were considered for the role of:
British Scottish actor Ray Park was considered for the role during the early 2000s after he portrayed Toad in the X-Men movie series.
British English actor Scott Adkins was considered for the role of Iron Fist as well as the Punisher in the late 2000s following his stunt doubling of Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool in 2009. He later played Lucian Aster in Doctor Strange.

David Armstrong and Jared Burke were stunt doubles for Finn Jones in the role of Iron Fist.
Rocky Kellon Smith was a stand-in for Finn Jones in the role of Iron Fist.
In Latin American dubbing of The Defenders, when Jessica Jones calls him incorrectly Ironclad, she calls him Iron Man.
