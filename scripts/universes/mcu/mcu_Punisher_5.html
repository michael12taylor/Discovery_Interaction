<html><p>However, as he was being beaten into submission, the Punisher had then managed to reach behind him and grabbed a steel plate, which he used to strike the Russian across the face with incredible force. With the Russian momentarily stunned, the Punisher did not hesitate in hitting him twice more across the face, while turning to Kazan and questioning if he wanted to talk with him now. With Kazan watching in complete and utter horror, the Punisher then proceeded to punch the Russian into the face three more times, destroying his face and killing him, as the Russian's lifeless corpse dropped onto the floor.

Punisher demands some answers from Kazan
Standing victorious over the Russians, the Punisher then walked over to a now horrified Kazan, who insisted that he was not the Punisher's enemy. However, the Punisher then grabbed the dropped barbel and furiously pinned Kazan up against the wall by his throat, as he then demanded to know who it was who had hired Fiona's Crew to take the photographs, although Kazan insisted that he would get killed if he told him, while the Punisher warned that he would kill him if he did not. Kazan finally revealed that it was Nikolai Poloznev who had hired them, as the Punisher had questioned where he could find Poloznev, although Kazan simply told him to look him up on the internet.

Punisher and Turk Barrett walking out the gym
Having finally gotten the answers he needed about the photographs, the Punisher then released Kazan from his grip, before knocking him unconscious with a punch to the head. Spitting out some blood, the Punisher had then glared at Barrett before walking away, with Barrett following. Fearing for his life, Barrett had insisted that he had been forced to betray him by the Russians, although the Punisher insisted that he should not worry, since Barrett had done exactly what he had wanted him to do, much to his considerable annoyance as they both then insisted that they did not want to see each other again.

Leaving with Amy Bendix
Castle explains to Amy Bendix his successes
Having completed his last mission, Castle had then returned to Dinah Madani's Apartment, where he was greeted by Amy Bendix, who had been shocked to see him covered in blood. When Bendix questioned if his plan had gone really well or really badly, Castle did not say a word and simply replied by putting his thumbs up, as Bendix had questioned what he would look like if the mission had gone badly, which Castle had ignored.

Castle learning who Nikolai Poloznev really is
While Castle got some ice to cover up his latest injuries, he explained that Sergei Konchevsky's people were not after them, as somebody had actually targeted them, telling Bendix that Nikolai Poloznev had targeted the Russian Mafia. As Castle then sat down to rest, Bendix went online to look up Poloznev, and was shocked to discover that he was a former member of the Police of Russia turned wealthy and powerful industrialist, who was the personal friend Vladimir Putin and currently lived within New York City. Bendix questioned what to do now and how they would go after Poloznev to get answers.

Bendix and Frank Castle leave the apartment
Intending to go after Poloznev, Castle and Bendix had then packed up their belongings and departed Madani's Apartment, with Bendix leaving Madani's credit card behind. As they walked down the streets of New York, Bendix questioned where they would go, as Castle told her that Curtis Hoyle had a place where they could stay in. Bendix had then also noted that Madani would be annoyed that they did not bother leaving town as she instructed, although Castle claimed that Madani would never even notice, also noting that Madani was never happy, which was a comment Bendix had also previously made.

Destruction of Clive's Studio
Castle arrives outside of Clive's Photo Studio
Since they needed to get the pictures developed without being seen, Castle and Amy Bendix went to an illegal Photo Studio, with Bendix dressing as an underage girl, in order to make it appear like they had wanted to shoot underage pornography there. As they stood outside the building, Castle then suggested that he could kick the door down, although Bendix commented on the size of the door and that he would be unable to.

Castle and Amy Bendix offering Clive money
Bendix had knocked on the door, as Clive looked through a peephole in the door and had immediately refused to allow Castle in. Knocking again, Clive still refused to let them in, until Castle claimed that they had been sent there by Uncle Teddy, causing Clive to look down at Bendix's outfit. Believing they would be there to shoot illegal images, Clive insisted on seeing the money, as Castle showed off a handful of cash, causing Clive to close the peephole and finally open the door for them, giving them assess to his studio, as Bendix commented on the size of the door and how it would take an army to kick it down.

Punisher furiously stares at the terrified Clive
Once they were inside, Clive then showed Castle and Bendix around the studio as he explained how he expected to get paid for his time and the use of the studio, also promising that these images could not be traced back to the New York City Police Department. However, as Castle began looking at some of these provocative outfits that Clive had for those underage girls he photographed and which were being offered to Bendix, Castle became enraged, as he then proceeded to punch Clive in the jaw, knocking him down to the ground. Castle then kicked Clive in the side, before he ordered Bendix to get to work.

Punisher beating down Clive into submission
While Bendix had then gone into the next room to begin developing the photographs she had taken in Chicago for Fiona, Castle had sat down and begun staring at the utterly terrified Clive. However, Castle had then witnessed Clive attempting to reach his hand underneath a sofa and grabbed his hidden shotgun, only for Castle to rush over as he had grabbed the shotgun out of his hands, swiftly disarming Clive. Enraged that Clive had tried to shoot him, Castle then struck him into the face with the gun, before reloading it and breaking both of Clive's arms by hitting him with the shotgun with some considerable force.

Punisher being convinced not to execute Clive
As Clive was bleeding heavily and weeping out of terror, Castle then pressed the shotgun against his chest, as he prepared to execute the pedophile. They were then interrupted by Bendix, who had returned with the developed images, as Clive then begged for his life, asking Bendix to stop Castle from executing him while insisting that he did not do enough to warrant being killed. When Bendix then questioned if Castle was actually planning to execute Clive, Castle simply told her to wait outside. However, Bendix gently touched Castle's arm as she suggested that this would be a step too far, even for Castle.

Punisher and Amy Bendix destroy the studio
Taking Bendix's advice, Castle then lowered the shotgun, telling Clive that this was his lucky day, as he and Bendix proceeded to leave him bleeding on the floor. Before they left the Photo Studio, Bendix noted that Castle was clearly disappointed that he did not get to kill Clive, which he did not comment on as he prepared to leave. However, just before they walked away, Bendix suggested that they could burn that studio to the ground if it made him feel better. Wanting to stop Clive's illegal operations, Castle and Bendix then set  the entire studio aflame and walked away together, with Clive just making it out in time.

Hunting Billy Russo
Meeting with Curtis Hoyle
Castle discussing how he will kill Billy Russo
Castle went inside the St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church where he met with Curtis Hoyle and Dinah Madani to consider the situation. Castle had learned from Hoyle that Billy Russo had been hanging with a group of veterans and that he was now in control of them, so people could potentially die because of him. Castle was convinced by Hoyle that Russo was a priority target and they needed to deal with him as soon as possible. Castle agreed with Hoyle, claiming that he was going to deal with Russo by his methods.

Chasing Jigsaw's Crew
Punisher comes back face to face with Jigsaw
As Russo and his crew were leaving the bank, Castle dressed as Jake Nelson arrived. Russo began berating him for being late to the robbery, he was stunned to realize that actually it was really Frank Castle wearing the vest that plagued Russo's nightmares. As Castle killed both Mike and Geno, Russo was grabbed by his crew, and drove off.

Punisher attempts to shoot at Jigsaw's Crew
Castle is underfired by Todd, he gave chase to Russo in the crew's initial getaway vehicle, as he was determined to seek closure from their previous engagement, which was left unsettled.

Castle continued to chase Russo which an overwhelmed Russo angrily ordered José to stop the car in the middle of 
k street while arming a machine gun, for he was preparing for a gunfight.

Punisher taking cover from Jigsaw's gunshots
Castle paused after Russo's car screeched to a halt on the street. Confused by the apparent betrayal of one of his best friends, Russo demanded answers from Castle to confirm his suspicions that he was responsible for all the scarring on his face. Castle, who perceived Russo as an enemy, admitted to doing so with haste. Russo then went in a fit of rage, unleashing his wrath by furiously firing his gun violently in Castle's vicinity, going against the urges of his robber comrades.

Punisher has a face off against Brett Mahoney
Castle and Russo exchanged gunfire, the NYPD officers led by Brett Mahoney interfered, which also ruined Hoyle's opportunity to kill Russo with a sniper. After an extensive, prolonged gunfight, Russo's failure to kill Castle prompted him to escape with the rest of his crew, as he was not willing to be arrested. As per Castle, Mahoney gave chase to him and cornered him into an alleyway. While attempting to arrest him, Hoyle came from behind him and aimed at Mahoney the rifle he took from Phillip earlier. This allowed Castle to make a swift escape from the police.

Assassination of Billy Russo
Punisher looks at the morally wounded Jigsaw
Following his fight against John Pilgrim, the Punisher was called up by Curtis Hoyle, who informed him that Billy Russo had just spoken to him and was currently dying from blood loss on the floor of the St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church. The Punisher then went to the church, finding Russo lying in a pool of his own blood, having been shot three times by Dinah Madani, as Russo had mistakenly believed that Hoyle had come to be with him, only to bitterly laugh when he saw the Punisher.

Punisher finally shoots and kills Billy Russo
Looking at his former friend, Russo noted that the Punisher was not looking too good, before noting that if anybody could be with him as he died, he was glad it was the Punisher. However, the Punisher did not say a word as he looked down at Russo without feeling. Russo then attempted to apologise for everything that he had done, only for the Punisher to shoot him twice in the chest, killing Russo once and for all. The Punisher then left Russo's corpse behind, allowing Brett Mahoney to discover it with Hoyle and Madani, who both denied that the Punisher was actually the one who had finished Russo off.

Death of the Schultzes
Punisher shooting Eliza Schultz in the head
With Billy Russo finally dead, the Punisher and Amy Bendix had gone to finish their conflict, as they went into the Schultz Mansion, as the Punisher allowed Bendix to go there alone to confront the Schultzes, while John Pilgrim had gone to rescue both of his sons. With Bendix confronting the Schultzes over everybody they had killed to keep their secrets, the Punisher had witnessed Eliza Schultz attempting to grab a knife to attack Bendix, only for the Punisher to shoot her in the back of the head.

Punisher giving Anderson Schultz his choices
The Punisher then stepped inside the room and checked that Bendix was okay, before looking at Anderson Schultz, who was now frozen in horror upon seeing his wife get shot in the head, with the Punisher noting that he was going to offer them both a choice, but Eliza clearly made hers. The Punisher then showed Schultz the recording of him confessing to their conspiracy, as well as the murder of both Sergei Konchevsky and Nikolai Poloznev, and Fiona's entire Crew. When the Punisher then looked at Schultz, he began to weep, knowing that he had been exposed, as the Punisher questioned their motivations.

Punisher and Amy Bendix let John Pilgrim go
While Schultz weeped, the Punisher noted how David Schultz had become a good man despite his parent's actions. The Punisher then gave Schultz a chance to finish things by giving Schultz his gun and a single bullet, before ordering Schultz to shoot himself in the head, or he and Bendix would put the video of his confession online. The Punisher and Bendix then walked out of the mansion, seeing Pilgrim standing with his two sons who he had saved, before they overheard the sound of Schultz shooting himself. With the Schultzes dead, the Punisher had then allowed Pilgrim to leave along with his sons.

Sending Amy Bendix Away

New Chapter
Contacted by the CIA
Three months after Amy Bendix's departure, Castle completely went off the grid, breaking off all of his contacts. Understanding that he is unable to continue his life, Castle decided to accept the mantle of the Punisher and resume his anti-criminal crusade. As he targeted two criminal gangs based in New York City and tracked them down to an old warehouse, he was suddenly called by Dinah Madani whose phone number was blocked. Castle ignored Madani's calls, continuing to watch for his targets outside of his car. Madani insisted and Castle finally answered and asked her how she found him. Madani replied that she left the Homeland Security and joined the CIA which allowed her to use the Agency equipment to track down Castle.

Castle dismisses Dinah Madani's offer of work
Castle then asked Madani what she wanted and Madani answered that the CIA was informed about a high-profile target and Madani needs help to eliminate him. Due to Madani's intention to work with him again, Castle noted that Madani had changed since the last time they met what Madani agreed, commenting that she spent too much time with him. She offered Castle the chance to participate in the CIA mission to  do what he does best, but Castle refused to work with her, making Madani deal with her problems by herself. 

Punisher violently massacres all the criminals
Spotting the last gang member enter the warehouse, Castle donned his new Skull Vest and grabbed his weapons before walking to the warehouse. The deal between the two gangs went south as both of their leaders thought that they were lured in the trap. All gang members pulled their guns on each other, intending to start a gunfight before Castle drew their attention. Before they could react and fight back, Castle prepared his weapons and violently massacred all gang members in front of him, without any mercy and hesitation.

Personality
Frank Castle is a man who has come to see the world in pure black and white terms and believes that the only way to keep the streets safe is to kill criminals so they do not harm innocents again. His sense of morality has turned to the extreme, differing greatly from what most would consider acceptable ideals of good and bad. He firmly believes that the wicked deserve to be punished and stopped permanently and that their deaths - no matter how brutal and even illegal are needed as they better the world. As a consequence, Castle is a controversial figure among the general public, with many people either praising or condemning his actions. His military past has hardened him to even the most extensive violence, as well as his iron mentality; he claims to not suffer any PTSD for his actions as a Marine nor did he claim to feel particularly disturbed when he saw his friends die or kill for the first time. However, the events left him too exhausted to even read a bedtime story to his daughter. The death of his wife and children in contrast completely traumatize him with vivid night terrors and flashbacks to the night they were murdered.

When his wife, son, and daughter were murdered, a devastated Castle turned into a violent almost sociopathic individual, determined to kill every single criminal who had a hand in his family's death. When dealing with criminals, he becomes an extremist. He is brutal, cold, and efficient. He would use extreme tactics such as torture, brutality and eventually kill them. He firmly believes that the truly evil deserve no mercy, and as such he holds no regret in the deaths of any criminal he kills.

However, despite this Castle greatly values the lives of innocents, and will do his absolute best to make sure that civilians are not harmed, as shown when he went to the hospital looking for Grotto and made sure not to harm any patients or Karen Page. Castle upholds an honor code of "One Shot, One Kill"; getting the job done as quickly as possible, whilst trying to avoid any collateral damage. As he delved deeper into Rawlins and Russo’s operations, he became increasingly more vengeful and sadistic, abandoning the honor code of his squad in pursuit of his personal vengeance especially as he realizes it was a part of his own squad that betrayed him. This led him to brutally torture Rawlins to death, prolonging his suffering for as long as possible in stark contrast to swiftly murdering the Blacksmith with a headshot when Castle also had the opportunity to torture him for his family’s death. Despite his lack of hesitation to kill, he still refused to kill Billy Russo, violently mutilating his handsome face instead. Whilst he claims this was also to prolong his miserable life with a constant punishment of his wicked deeds, it is possible he could not bring himself to kill his former closest friend. He also avoided killing Daredevil, and when presented with the chance to kill him, Castle simply resorted to knocking him out. After Billy Russo murdered several prostitutes and framed Castle for the crime, he was in disbelief and shock that he took innocent lives, leading to him losing his drive as the Punisher. However, after discovering his innocence in the matter, his drive for vengeance and to take down Russo returned and he readopted the mantle.

Despite his cold and ruthless demeanor, beneath it all, Castle is a man who strongly and deeply misses his beloved family and wishes only to make up for what he sees as his inability to protect them. Though he undoubtedly loved his family with all his heart, Castle has admitted that his true home is only at wartime and when he feels like a soldier - something which he enjoyed being more than a family man. Despite having the chance to honor their memories and accept their deaths, Castle believes his vengeance against those who murdered them is more important and ultimately what drives him to war. It is ultimately the lack of conflict in life that scares Castle rather than death and having no true home to call to. Castle also appears to believe in returning favors, since him helping Daredevil defeat the Hand ninjas can be seen as him repaying the vigilante for rescuing him from torture at the hands of the Kitchen Irish.

Castle dislikes being thought of as insane or not in control of his actions as it goes against what he believes his mission stands for. At the same time, he does not seem to care what the citizens of New York and the law enforcement think of him as he has witnessed their ineptitude in dealing with his family's murder first hand. He openly sneered at Daredevil for considering himself a "hero" as he claims that he was only "one bad day away" from being like Castle. Indeed, Castle knocks out Daredevil when he claimed that he was insane and goes into a furious rant in court when they planned to instigate him into a mental asylum, admitting he was fully sane and enjoyed killing every criminal he encountered.

Outside of “the mission,” Castle does have other interests and even a certain sense of fun, such as playing guitar. He seems to have a liking for disco and funk, commenting that he enjoyed singing along to “Shining Star” by Earth Wind & Fire so much that he nearly drove the rest of his unit crazy with it. He also enjoys reading and goes through books at a fast pace. Beyond this Castle has no interest in making friends as seen when he was working as a construction worker where he worked tirelessly without breaks for six months with almost no human contact towards his co-workers with the exception of occasionally meeting with Curtis Hoyle. Despite this, Castle has shown the capability to grow emotionally attached to people in his life regardless of his hardened exterior as seen with David Lieberman and Amy Bendix. Although he first acted cold and distant towards her, Castle eventually warmed up to and became protective of Bendix. He expressed a very genuine concern for her well being and threatened to kill a hitman if he was to harm Amy in any way. Later, when Bendix was about to leave to return to a normal life, Castle said he would miss her and even hugged her, a sign of affection that he rarely showed to others.

Abilities
Punisher brutally fighting against Jack
Master Combatant: As a former Force Recon Marine with years of experience, Castle is an extremely skilled, dangerous, fierce, and lethal master hand-to-hand combatant, making him one of the most dangerous and best fighters on the planet. He was able to go toe-to-toe against the enormously skilled Daredevil, even briefly gaining the upper hand against him in their first encounter. His fighting style includes martial arts disciplines from the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, such as Krav Maga, boxing, muay Thai, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, judo, karate, and Taekwondo. He impressed Daredevil with his speed and ferocity, despite the latter ultimately being able to get the upper hand in the fight, with the use of his agility. Hence, Castle, while unarmed, survived being ambushed by multiple armed prison inmates at once, swiftly taking them all down in a brutal bloodthirsty fashion, greatly impressing Wilson Fisk, who claimed that Castle has a "unique talent." Castle also quickly overpowered William Rawlins, held his own against Carson Wolf, and defeated Billy Russo after a prolonged fight. Marion James stated Rawlins looked like he was "hit by a train" after he was overpowered and killed by Castle, and Sam Stein drafted an extensive medical examination after Castle killed Carson Wolf. Marlena Olin later commended his fighting skills after seeing him fight in Lola's Roadhouse. Castle possesses a high pain tolerance that allows him to continue fighting even after being beaten by crowbars, dumbbells, punched with a chain-wrapped fist, and even being shot. During his attempted attack on Billy Russo, Castle was able to kill several of Russo's henchmen even after they beat him ruthlessly with crowbars. In fact, being beat only seemed to enrage him more.
Knife Mastery: Castle often prefers to incorporate knife slashes into his combat style, making him all the more lethal. He has also showcased skills in knife-throwing, such as when Anvil operators ambushed Micro's Hideout.
Hammer Proficiency: Castle is proficient in using hammer. He was able to killed Lance and his lackeys using his sledgehammer with ease in order to rescue Donny Chavez.
Staff Proficiency: Castle is proficient in using staff. He was able to use Daredevil's Billy Club with no issues. Castle was also able to use a baseball bat to beat Clint to death.
Punisher shooting one of the Hand ninjas
Master Marksman: Castle graduated from Marine Corps Base in Quantico of class 307. A former scout sniper and marine, Castle is a very accurate marksman and has tremendous expertise in handling many firearms, including pistols, revolvers, automatic rifles, shotguns, submachine guns, sniper rifles, machine guns, and grenade launchers. Due to his military training, Frank Castle is a deadly shot, adhering to his unit's philosophy of "one shot, one kill," managing to shoot Ahmad Zubair, Nesbitt, Daredevil, Finn Cooley, Speed, Chaney, Ray Schoonover, the Cartel Sicario, Paulie, Moose, Tony Gnucci, Jack, Davy, Mike, Davis, Todd, and Eliza Schultz all in the head. With his devastating use in firearms, he made many criminals and police officials believe his attacks were the work of a group or "army." Hence, as the Punisher, Castle rarely misses his target, and easily avoids injuring innocent civilians, thus managing to swiftly take down the last four Hand ninjas without wounding Daredevil, all from an immense distance away. Castle later sniped the Cartel Sicario in the head with an immensely long range from across the border. Castle can also shoot his enemies in nonlethal spots to prolong their suffering or to interrogate them before they die, as he did with Marlena Olin by intentionally missing her bone by shooting through and through the meat in her thigh, leading Evans to refer to him as "one hell of a shot," meaning phenomenal. During John Pilgrim's attack on the Larkville police station, he shot a Molotov cocktail before an assassin could throw it, dousing him in flames. Outside Tipsy Tilly's Bar, Castle quickly gunned down six bounty hunters before five of them could pull their weapons on him. Castle can also hit his targets without actually seeing them, demonstrated when he fired his rifle from one flight of stairs above him to kill two hitmen. Finn Cooley described Castle as an "artist with the AK," and Blake Tower later said that Castle "shot the city to hell."
Master Assassin: Castle's Marine Corps service enables him to locate his enemies and eliminate them with military precision. According to Blake Tower and Samantha Reyes, survivors of his brutal kill methods are certain to be found and killed by him, even if they're under assumed names. His aptitude for killing has left many astonished, including Karen Page and Grotto, and he is so effective he was initially mistaken to be a group of trained killers rather than a single person. He has eliminated high-profile targets with the Cerberus Squad and trained to use weapons with superb efficiency. He is surgical and precise, using all of his skills with firearms, stealth and hand-to-hand combat to kill his opponents, seen when he singlehandedly and systematically killed multiple Mujahideen in Kandahar, members of the Kitchen Irish at the Burren Club, members of the Mexican Cartel in the Meatpacking District, members of the Dogs of Hell at a Redfield Electronics garage, more of the Kitchen Irish at the Central Park carousel, an entire wing of prisoners on Ryker's Island, Ray Schoonover's henchman guarding his ship, the Gnucci Crime Family under Linello's, Mazur and his gang in their garage, a squad of Anvil agents in Micro's Hideout, Marlena Olin's mercenaries at the Tides Motel, John Pilgrim's mercenaries in Larkville, Russian thugs in Kazan's Gym, members of Jigsaw's Crew outside ReadyQuick Check Cashing, bounty hunters outside Tipsy Tilly's Bar and on Crescent Street, members of Jigsaw's Crew in Valhalla, and finally over a dozen gangsters in an abandoned warehouse. Castle was able to snap a neck of prisoner and Carson Wolf, and quickly draw his guns to fire at his enemies. Castle is also able to see deadly potential in objects in order to weaponize his environment against his opponents, such as when he bashed a Mujahideen's head in with a rock, bludgeoned Clint with a metal baseball bat, killed Dutton and his bodyguard with a shiv, impaled a prisoner with a sharpened wooden stick, broke a pot of coffee over Speed's head, ran over two Dogs of Hell with his van, strangled Mickey O'Hare with his own necktie, beat Paulie, Leo and Lance with a sledgehammer, hit Carson Wolf in the head with a toaster and photo frame, slammed Eddie's head through a bathroom sink, used dumbbells to defeat Kazan's henchmen, used weights to overpower and kill the Russian, and improvised scrap metal against John Pilgrim in a junkyard. Dinah Madani sought to recruit him directly to assist in the apprehension of a high-value target, disregarding all other agents of the CIA in favor of his skills, declaring him to be "the best" in his line of work.
Master Tactician: Castle is a highly skilled, effective and experienced military tactician, since notably, during the seemingly hopeless extraction of his unit, Castle assumed command, and single-handedly cleared a helicopter landing zone of enemy combatants (that prevented his unit's escape), while the rest of his men, even Ray Schoonover, hunkered down. Castle even anticipated this conflict as a trap, despite Schoonover requesting his tactical input and Russo supporting his strategic instincts only to have Rawlins negate it. He later received the Navy Cross for his efforts. As the Punisher, Castle later used these tactics to single-handedly track and kill entire gangs of criminals with high efficiency, to the point that Castle was initially mistaken by Daredevil and the police for an entire squad of gunmen, rather than a single man.
Expert Interrogator: Castle enrolled in his SERE course, and is thus well-versed in interrogation tactics, such as employing intimidation techniques to extract information from suspects. Castle was able to successfully perform a reverse interrogation on Carson Wolf which allowed him to learn the truth about his  family's murder. Castle was also able to extract information from Jake Nelson a fellow war veteran who took the SERE course through torture.
Musician: Castle can play the guitar to some extent.
Equipment
Weapons
Punisher attempts to shoot at Lewis Wilson
Kimber Warrior: Castle carried this handgun as his service pistol during his time in the United States Marine Corps, and while serving as part of the Cerberus Squad. While serving in Operation Cerberus, he was ordered to use his handgun to kill Ahmad Zubair, which began to question the validity of his work in that mission, as he was also ordered to retrieve the bullet from Zubair's corpse. During their last mission, when the entire squad was ambushed, Castle took upon himself to clear the area, single-handedly defeating all enemies with the weapons he had available, using his handgun when his assault rifle ran out of ammunition. Castle carried this handgun when he took Karen Page to a diner. While being there, he noticed that a car had been following them and that they were going to be attacked. As two soldiers working for the Blacksmith entered into the diner, Castle opened fire and avoided their shots. Despite he lost the handgun during the shootout, he overpowered the two men, and retrieved the handgun to kill the two injured soldiers, shooting one of them in the head, and killing the other using the gun as a club. He also took it to the ship that the Blacksmith used to smuggle heroin into New York City, almost using it to kill a man that claimed to be the Blacksmith, until being disarmed by Daredevil. Castle obtained another one of these handguns from the weapons cache he stole from the Greek Mob, and began to use it as his main sidearm, such as when he used it to threaten Colonel Morty Bennett for information and had to shoot a soldier while escaping from Fort Bryon, or when he took to prevent Lewis Wilson from killing Stan Ori and Karen Page, confronting Lewis until he was forced to holster it when members of Anvil appeared, and finally losing it Billy Russo shot him while Dinah Madani had him cornered. Castle took a spare one from his his hideout and used it as his sidearm during an ambush in the men that Russo would send after him, hoping that Russo himself would appear. He resorted to using the handgun when he was forced to kill one of the agents in close-quarters-combat, until retrieving a shotgun, but used it again to executing Jack, the field leader of the team, whom he had mistaken for Russo. Castle took the gun as his sidearm, briefly dueling Russo with them as they were battling in the carousel of Central Park. Russo resorted to threatening the hostages, forcing Castle to throw his own gun away. Russo then shot at him, and realizing that Dinah Madani was sneaking upon him, he also shot at her, giving Castle the chance to disarm him. Castle kept the handgun as his gun, and used when he became involved against the mercenaries chasing Amy Bendix. He used it in a firefight at the Tides Motel, when he emerged from another room through a hole in the wardrobe to quickly kill the three mercenaries inside the room he had rented. He then opened fire and killed the sniper waiting for them outside, and despite being disarmed by Marlena Olin, he eventually retrieved the gun and shot her precisely in the knee. Castle used his handgun to teach Bendix how to disarm someone, as she had asked that maybe he could teach her how to use it while he was cleaning it. As he went with Curtis Hoyle to investigate a couple of leads regarding Billy Russo, he carried the handgun to break into Jake Nelson's apartment, and Russo's hideout. They followed Russo to the place where he planned to committ a robbery, and he engaged in a shootout against Russo and his men. When he returned to the trailer where Amy Bendix was hiding, she tried to distract and disarm him, though Castle reacted instinctively and almost shot at her, and he angrily shot in the wall to let her know how close had he been to kill her for that. Castle also used it to ambush a small group of members of Jigsaw's Crew, wounding Moke and killing the rest with the intention of capturing him alive. However, as Moke opened fire, Castle was forced to shoot again, killing him. While following a lead from Moke's phone, a group of six mercenaries who wanted to claim a bounty on Castle followed, though Castle was quick enough to shoot and kill five of them, and killing their leader after obtaining information on the bounty. Castle resorted to use his handgun as lost the rifle he was carrying when he fell into Billy Russo's ambush as he infiltrated into Valhalla. However, he lost the gun too as he was attacked by Russo's men.
Springfield Armory XDM Compact: Castle carried this handgun in an ankle holster when he went to Metro-General Hospital to try to kill Grotto. Once Daredevil attacked Castle, he resorted to take this handgun and shoot him in the head.
Para 1911 G.I. Expert: Castle carried this handgun when he visited the carousel in Central Park where his family had been killed. The Kitchen Irish set an ambush there, and Castle killed some of them until he was overwhelmed and kidnapped under Finn Cooley's orders.
Punisher firing at Pilgrim
Heckler & Koch P30: Castle obtained this gun from one of the members of the Kitchen Irish that was about to use it on him under Finn Cooley's order when they realized that Castle had tricked them into activating a trap. However, Castle freed himself, took the gun from the henchman and used to kill him and shoot at Cooley, before discarding it for a Franchi SPAS-12 shotgun. Castle took another of these handguns to the motel where John Pilgrim was staying and broke into his room with the gun, finding it empty. Pilgrim, who was in the adjacent room, began shooting through the wall, beginning a firefight, where Castle returned fire with the gun until he managed to take a rifle from Pilgrim's bag of weapons, but keeping the handgun.
