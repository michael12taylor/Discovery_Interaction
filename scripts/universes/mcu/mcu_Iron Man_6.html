<html><p>Having learned that Thanos was the one who pulled the strings behind Loki and the Chitauri Invasion, Stark realizes that he was the one who was really responsible for his fear and anxiety in the ensuing years since the Battle of New York. Leaning and stretching against the Cauldron of the Cosmos, Stark remarks on Strange's use of language, getting hit by the Cloak of Levitation, much of his allowance. Stark suggested disposing the Time Stone, but Strange and Wong informed him they were sworn to protect it.

Stark notices commotion coming from outside
As Thanos had two stones and the other two were not on Earth, the best move would be to protect Vision, who had the Mind Stone embedded in his head; however, Vision had disappeared two weeks earlier. Only the fugitive Captain America could possibly find him. Banner insisted that Stark call Rogers, only for Stark to explain to Banner that him and Rogers had fallen out, and that they were not on speaking terms. Banner would convinced Stark to call Rogers by telling him that Thanos had killed their teammate Thor. However, before Stark could place the call, they were interrupted by the sound of agitation in the streets and debris flying through the air.

Attack on Greenwich Village
Stark confronts Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian
Leaving the Sanctum to investigate, the four found people fleeing and screaming in panic, as a Q-Ship sent by Thanos had arrived, devastating the surrounding city with powerful winds. Outside the New York Sanctum, The Q-Ship was confronted by Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, Doctor Strange and Wong. As Stark commanded F.R.I.D.A.Y to evacuate the surrounding area and mobilize emergency response teams, Doctor Strange casts the Winds of Watoomb, neutralizing the powerful winds created by the Q-Ship.

Iron Man donning the Mark L armor to fight
As Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian arrived from their Q-Ship, they demanded the Time Stone, kept in the Eye of Agamotto, from Strange, only for Stark to rudely rebuff and commanded the two to leave Earth. To Stark's embarrassment, Banner tried and failed to turn into Hulk; as they didn't have time to understand why, Stark benched his friend from the fight. Stark donned his nanotech Mark L armor, and blasted away Obsidian, astonishing Banner.

Iron Man and Doctor Strange fight Ebony Maw
As Strange began using an attack, Stark blasted off a car that was aimed at him and Wong. Maw then sends Iron Man flying into the air while directly assaulting Strange and Wong with his telekinetic powers, throwing debris at the Masters. Iron Man returned, commanding Strange to also flee and get the Time Stone away from the city, who refused. Iron Man attempted to assault Maw again, only to be engaged by Obsidian, who sent Iron Man flying into Washington Square Park, encountering Banner.

Iron Man is saved from Cull Obsidian by Wong
While holding off Obsidian to protect Banner, Iron Man was joined by an arriving Spider-Man and told him about what is going on with the situation. Iron Man tasked him with rescuing the unconscious Strange as he held off Obsidian. As the battle continued, Iron Man was caught by Obsidian's hammer and was about to be killed, only to be saved by Wong. Once Wong trapped Obsidian from another location, Iron Man broke free and invited him to his wedding, flying afterwards.

Ascent to Space
Iron Man flies up in order to save Spider-Man
After finishing his battle, Iron Man managed to locate the Q-Ship and flew towards the sky while deploying Item 17A from the New Avengers Facility. Beginning to run out of oxygen, Spider-Man removed his mask as he unable to breathe as much as he can. Iron Man commanded Spider-Man to let go and fall in order to catch him. Spider-Man told Iron Man that he must save the wizard as he was told by him, but Iron Man retorted his statement that he won't be able to breathe as the ship moved upward.

Iron Man deploys Spider-Man's new armor
As he exhaustively starts to pass out, Spider-Man was nearly suffocated as the ship left Earth's atmosphere and fell off the ship as he couldn’t breathe anymore. Falling down, Spider-Man was rescued by the intervention of Iron Man, who summoned the Iron Spider Armor. As the suit manifested around him with nanotech particles, Spider-Man swiftly recovered with an acrobatic landing and was able to breathe and contact Iron Man.

Iron Man going onboard inside the Q-Ship
As he catches up with Parker, Stark told him farewell up on the ship and commanded F.R.I.D.A.Y. to send him back to Earth, using his parachute to descend into orbit. Stark latched onto the hull to cut a hole and board the Q-Ship, to look for wherever Doctor Strange and Ebony Maw went. Getting a call from Pepper Potts, Stark answered the call and told her that he was on the ship, only to lose reception halfway at Potts' expense.

Rescue of Doctor Strange
Stark notices Spider-Man onboard the Q-Ship
Onboard the Q-Ship, Stark was joined by Cloak of Levitation who shows him to Strange and the Time Stone. As they prepared their next move, observing from above, they were surprised by the appearance of Spider-Man, who had also stowed away, much to Stark's horror. As Stark berated Peter Parker for disobeying his orders, Parker reasoned that he could not act as a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man without a neighborhood to defend.

Stark listening to Spider-Man's latest plan
Listening to Parker's response and knowing that he can't argue against it, Stark had no choice but to team up with him and decided give him assess of the situation. Walking towards the the ledge, Stark told Parker where Ebony Maw was holding Strange captive and asked for any ideas to distract him. Thinking quickly, Parker immediately suggested a plan that reminisced a scene from Aliens. Once he listened, Stark would then follow the plan before Strange would be further tortured by Maw.

Iron Man interrupts Ebony Maw's interrogation
As Maw continued to probe Strange for the Time Stone, Iron Man suddenly appeared behind him. As part of Parker's plan, Stark fired a missile past Maw, into the wall of the Q-Ship. The missile caused a hull breach, instantly sucking a screaming Maw into the vacuum of space to his death. However, Strange himself was inadvertently caught in the vacuum, and the Cloak unsuccessfully attempted to rescue him.

Stark considers his next course of action
Leaping in, Spider-Man managed to grab Strange, and with aid from his new armor's artificial spider limbs, was able to narrowly pull him to safety, allowing Iron Man to seal the breach using his nanobots. Stark noted that the Ship was on an automated course bound for an unknown location. Strange insisted that Stark commandeer the ship to return them and the Time Stone to Earth, although Stark was reluctant.

Stark declaring Spider-Man as an Avenger
Stark suggested a proposal for an attack on Thanos' territory, where he wouldn't be expecting. Although initially at odds, Strange reluctantly agreed with Stark's plan, after he told of his history over the years about Thanos' discourse. After agreeing, Strange reminded Stark that he would prioritize saving the Time Stone over either Stark or Parker's lives, asserting he would let them die if it means keeping the Stone from Thanos' hands. Satisfied by Strange's display of morality, Stark would then officially recruit Peter Parker to the Avengers.

Encountering the Guardians
Stark attempting to steer the Q-Ship
Arriving at their destination, Stark and Peter Parker steered the Q-Ship with an arm piece and attempted to safely land on the barren planet, Titan. Despite the attempt to avoid contact with the planet's surroundings, the ship crash-lands. Doctor Strange protected Stark and Parker from the impact of the crash-landing by shielding them through holographic Mandalas.

Stark scolding Spider-Man for his humor
Stark acknowledges that he owed Strange a debt for saving their lives from the crash. Parker appears upside down and asked them if there was something that could implant eggs in his chest. Stark angrily comments to him to never say anything pop culture related, but Parker was stating that something is coming towards them. Following Parker's warning, a grenade rolls into view, and the three get thrown back when its energy pulse was fired.

Iron Man firing a missile at Star-Lord
The three were then immediately ambushed by the Guardians of the Galaxy, Star-Lord, Drax the Destroyer, and Mantis, each believing the other to be working for Thanos. Star-Lord immediately starts firing at Iron Man, and a chase in the air ensues. Stark launches a missile at Star-Lord while in the air, but is pinned by his Gravity Mine in retaliation. Escaping Quill's Gravity Mine, Iron Man then flies over to Drax in order to capture and pin him down. As the brief scuffle ended at a stalemate, Spider-Man was held at gunpoint by Quill.

Stark questioning Star-Lord's interference
Turning off his helmet, Star-Lord then asked Stark where his missing teammate, Gamora, was. Agitated with his abrupt attack, Stark replied with a question that confused Quill and then asked who are the people he was attacking. Parker answered his question by saying that they were the Avengers. Eventually, once Mantis informed Stark about being acknowledged by Thor, both parties learned that they are both after Thanos and an alliance was formed between them.

Making a Plan
Stark announces his plan against Thanos
Analyzing the situation and the surroundings, Stark realized that their only advantage was that Thanos was coming to them, and thus the element of surprise could be utilized. The plan was simple: draw Thanos in, pin him down, and take the Infinity Gauntlet. As Stark tried to come up with a plan to stop Thanos, Drax yawned at the middle of the plan. Star-Lord explained that listening and not winging it isn’t what they do and Spider-Man questioned what exactly do the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy are doing.

Stark witnessing Doctor Strange's actions
Mantis explained what they do in a uncomprehending statement to which both Parker and Stark were completely dumbfounded. Stark told Star-Lord to get his team together and Quill expressed that while the plan was solid, he should execute it instead of Stark for a better outcome. As the plan was being formulated, Doctor Strange uses the Time Stone to view millions of different outcomes of the coming conflict against Thanos, to which he says there is only one in which they win.

Battle of Titan
Iron Man attacking directly at Thanos
When Thanos arrived on Titan, he was immediately greeted by Doctor Strange. Thanos recounted to the sorcerer how Titan was a beautiful planet with too little food and resources to go around for its people. When the Titans faced extinction, Thanos' "merciful" resolution was genocide across multiple planets.

Iron Man is rashly attacked by Thanos' power
At this moment, Thanos realized too late that Strange wasn't alone, and had lured the Titan into an ambush. Before he could react, he was immediately crushed underneath a massive piece of a spaceship hull, dropped on him by Iron Man. Using the Power and Reality Stones, the Titan freed himself by violently detonating the debris, before instantly transforming the rubble into an enormous swarm of bats.

Iron Man aerially battling against Thanos
The swarm quickly set upon Iron Man, forcing the Avenger to flee. Thanos was then bombarded by a renewed assault from Iron Man, who rained missiles down on the Titan. Unfazed, and with the Gauntlet freed, Thanos activated the Power and Space Stones. In a second, the explosive energy of Stark's missiles was absorbed by the Gauntlet and redirected at Iron Man in a concentrated beam of fire, blasting the Avenger far away into a spaceship husk. 

Iron Man and Spider-Man pull off the Gauntlet
With Thanos restrained, the group had executed the final step of their plan, as Mantis beckoned the others to hurry before Thanos broke her hold. Iron Man and Spider-Man moved to forcefully pull the Gauntlet from the Titan's hand. Flying in, Star-Lord confronted Thanos, before demanding the location of Gamora. Thanos began to react in anguish, with Mantis sensing that he was mourning. Nebula began to realize in horror that he sacrificed Gamora for the Soul Stone.

Iron Man restraining Star-Lord from interfering
In denial, Star-Lord angrily asked Thanos to tell him that Gamora was alive, only for Thanos to lament that he had no choice but to kill her, confirming Nebula's suspicions. Enraged, Star-Lord began to question Thanos for his actions. Observing this, Iron Man attempted to restrain him from any contact with Thanos, only for Star-Lord to ruthlessly attack him without thinking, inadvertently breaking Mantis' control over the Titan.

Iron Man desperately assaults a freed Thanos
Freed from his trance and now truly furious, Thanos quickly escaped his restraints and brutally overpowered the group. Iron Man made another desperate assault on Thanos, only for the Titan to turn to Titan's nearby moon. Using the Power and Space Stones, Thanos immediately pulverized the moon's surface, before hurling its fragments down on his opponents as a hail of meteors, incapacitating Iron Man.

Last Man Standing
Iron Man stormily confronting Thanos
Before Thanos could finish off Doctor Strange in their brief confrontation, Iron Man, being the final Avenger standing, restrained Thanos' gauntlet using a nanotech clamp. To the Avenger's surprise, Thanos recognized and called him by his name of Stark, before noting that they were both "cursed with knowledge."

Iron Man aggressively fighting against Thanos
Unfazed from Thanos' statements, Iron Man blamed him for his existences to be a curse, and attacked him first, blasting him with missiles. With Thanos distracted, Iron Man began attacking him relentlessly with his nanotech suit, kicking the Titan with his enhanced boosters before he could recover. Anchoring his feet to the ground, Iron Man immediately struck Thanos again with repulsor-powered battering rams, beating him back into a wall.

Iron Man protects himself from Thanos' attacks
Recovering quickly, Thanos tore off Iron Man's helmet with his bare hand and punched him to the ground. As Iron Man reformed his helmet just in time, Thanos quickly ripped the clamp from the Gauntlet, and blasted him with a concentrated beam from the Power Stone. Iron Man then managed to block the blast by forming a shield. Boosting towards Thanos, Iron Man swiftly pinned the Gauntlet to the ground using a foot clamp before pummeling the Titan's face with a repulsor-boosted hammer, with enough force to make him bleed.

Iron Man being taunted by Thanos
Unfazed from the damage upon his face, Thanos simply taunted the Avenger, for giving so much labor and struggle only to shed a single drop of blood. Thanos then effortlessly ripped the Gauntlet free from Iron Man's hold, flipping the Avenger onto his back. Thanos began to brutally beat Iron Man with his fists, breaking off more and more of his armor with each strike to the point of which he can not defend himself any longer.

Iron Man using his repulsors against Thanos
With Iron Man helpless to resist, Thanos followed with a powerful punched with the Power Stone into the Avenger's abdomen, sending him flying across the area and damaging his armor. Desperate and missing much of the upper half of his armor, Iron Man attempted to hold off Thanos with his repulsors, relocating the nanites on his leg to form new repulsors. Closing in, Thanos began beating the Avenger once again, destroying his helmet.

Iron Man being brutally stabbed by Thanos
Stark attempted to defend himself with his bare hands, only for Thanos to grab and trap his left hand. In an attempt to fight back, Stark immediately shifted the nanites from his left arm to his right arm to form a sword, and wildly stabbed at the Titan. However, Thanos simply tore the sword from Stark's hand and ruthlessly stabbed him in the abdomen with it, ending the fight. Cradling Stark's head in his hand, Thanos revealed his respect for Stark.

Stark being wounded after fighting Thanos
Nevertheless, Thanos said he hoped those who survive when he ended his mission would remember Stark and he prepared himself to kill him, only for Strange to intervene, offering the Time Stone in exchange for Stark's life. After Thanos took the Time Stone and left Titan, Stark would heal his wound, using the last of his nanites. Asking Strange why he would give up the Stone, Strange informed Stark that they were now in the endgame.

Thanos' Victory
Stark witnessing his allies turning into dust
Stark and his allies could only wait for Thanos to achieve his goals, and unlocked the powers of all combined Infinity Stones. Many of his allies began disintegrating into ash, including Doctor Strange and the Guardians of the Galaxy on Titan, much to his horror and distress. Stark attempted to reassure Star-Lord before his demise and was then told by Doctor Strange that this outcome was inevitable.

Stark mourns over the demise of his allies
Stark could only helplessly watch as Spider-Man then began disintegrating in his arms. Stark hugged the boy in an attempt to comfort him as Spider-Man begged Stark to save him until he accepted his fate and emotionally apologized for failing him. In the end, only Stark and Nebula remained on Titan. As Nebula somberly says in despair that Thanos had achieved his goal, Stark began mourning over the loss of his friends and Thanos' victory, unable to do anything but accept it, as he clutched Spider-Man's ashes.

Returning to Earth
Stark and Nebula trying to repair the Benatar
Directly after the Snap, Stark and Nebula used the Guardians of the Galaxy's ship, the Benatar, to get off Titan. Over the course of time they spent, Stark and Nebula discovered that the ship’s fuel cells had been cracked during the climax of the Battle of Titan. Attempting to fix it, they at least partially succeeded by working around the damage and tried to make back to Earth; however, the Benatar ran of flight power after only two days and gradually began running out of air, the former of which stranded the ship. Stark and Nebula attempted to fix this as well, but they simply failed to do so, leaving them lost in space.

Stark plays a friendly game with Nebula
Twenty-two days after the Snap, Stark and Nebula played a few rounds of Table Football in the bridge of the Benatar. As Nebula tried to catch one of the paper shards, Stark told that she doesn't need to do that and taught Nebula on how to play by letting their fingers still in position. As they continued to play more of the game, Stark and Nebula were eventually almost tied up and asked her if she would like to try again. Stark tried to make a goal but lost his aim, letting Nebula win the game and showed respect to her with a handshake. 

Stark leaves his message for Pepper Potts
Stark went to the front of the Benatar to record a message to Pepper Potts, using his helmet from the Battle of Titan. After Stark turned on the switch to record from his helmet, he tells Potts that if she finds the video of this recording, she should not post it on social media due to the sad situation he is in. Stark reflected on the past days of his survival, such as meeting Nebula, getting treatment from his injuries, fixing the ion charge from the ship that saved them forty-eight hours of time, and eating the remaining food rations.

Stark concludes his info during recording
Stark had then told Potts that the oxygen from the ship will run out the following morning, and that he hoped to pull off one last surprise. Stark told to not feel bad about his predicament and maybe just grovel and feel guilt for next upcoming weeks while he's gone. Stark began to drift off from the recording and finished the recording by saying he will promise to dream about Potts since it was always what he dreamed about. After finishing the recording, Stark put on his jacket and drifted off to sleep before Nebula put him in the captain's chair.

Stark discovers Captain Marvel hovering in front of him
While deeply sleeping from the chair for hours, Stark felt a slight arise of light coming from his face, causing some irritation. Stark suddenly awoke due to a beaming light outside the Benatar and as the glowing settled, and Captain Marvel revealed herself to be the glowing light, much to his surprise. As the group had decided to back to Earth, Danvers subsequently started to carry the Benatar back to Earth, locating across the New Avengers Facility where Stark would resign.

Stark and Pepper Potts being finally reunited
Getting the attention from the Avengers at the Facility, Captain Marvel landed on the ground where the Benatar had settled. Stark would be helped out by Nebula and Steve Rogers, once he got out of the ship's doorway. An emotional Stark tells Rogers that he was unable to stop Thanos, to which Rogers had responded back saying he couldn't as well. Stark then looked at Rogers and told him that he lost Peter Parker in the process. Before he had saying else, Stark was then greeted by an overwhelmed Potts. 

Stark gloomily sees a picture of Peter Parker
At the New Avengers Facility, the remaining Avengers conversed about the possible location of Thanos since the remaining days of him arriving to Earth. As the slide of pictures that were shown off from their system, Stark saw a picture of Parker as one of the casualties of Thanos' Snap, leading to him to look down and reminisce on his failure to protect the kid. Stark then asked the team about where Thanos was to which Rogers responded that they had no lead.

Stark meets Rocket Raccoon for the first time
Stark looked over to Thor and asked the team what had happened to him, leading Rocket Raccoon to tell him that he was guilty of failing to kill Thanos. While Rocket talked about the failure of each trying to stop Thanos, Stark was completely surprised from a talking raccoon, thinking he was a stuffed Build-A-Bear. When Rogers told Stark they been hunting Thanos for weeks and asked him if he had any indications of where Thanos could be, Stark mockingly erupted and told Rogers that he was beaten.

Stark rants about the past with Steve Rogers
Stark talked to the team about the vision he had that he didn't want to believe and saw it coming. As Rogers tried to tell him that he needed to focus, Stark angrily told Rogers that he needed him in past tense but it was too late to do that. As he began to fumble around the table and took off his tube from his arm, Stark then confronted Rogers, explaining that his attempt to build a suit of armor around the world was to prevent the very situation they were in.

Stark resting with Pepper Potts by his side
Stark then recalled the events of the Avengers Civil War, as he lost without the aid of Rogers, despite Rogers saying that if they lost, they would lose together. After giving up his Arc Reactor to Rogers in order to stop Thanos, Stark overcame his exhaustion and fainted in front of the team. Bruce Banner gave Stark a sedative, so that he can rest and heal due to his long duration in space. While Stark was resting, the remaining Avengers find Thanos, only to realize the Infinity Stones had been destroyed, leading Thor to decapitate Thanos.

A Normal Life
Reunited Again
Stark calling out for Morgan's attention
In the brutal aftermath of the Snap, Stark chose to retire from heroics, marrying Pepper Potts and having a daughter, named Morgan, and relocated to a cabin. Despite losing his allies, and half the universe to Thanos, Stark began to feel a sense of peace in the five years that followed.

Stark talks to Morgan about getting lunch
In 2023, Stark walked outside of his cabin and began to give his attention from Morgan so that she could get some lunch. After not having Morgan's attention, Stark sat down and called her full name again, to which Morgan gets out of the tent with her Mark XLIX helmet. Stark told Morgan to not wear the helmet since it was an anniversary gift for Potts, before taking her helmet off and asking if she was hungry for lunch. Stark then asked where Morgan found the helmet before picking her up, being told that she found it in his garage.

Stark is suddenly approached by his allies
While Stark and his daughter were about to enter back into the cabin, he was approached by Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Scott Lang, who proposed their idea of traveling back in time to acquire the Infinity Stones from the past in order to reverse Thanos' actions in the present. Stark disagreed with the group's decision to use Quantum energy to mess with the time scale or else they'll never return to their original timeline.

Stark strictly proposes to not mess with time
Once Lang told Stark that he came back from the past, he told Lang that his case was a billion in one chances of a cosmic fluke thus it could not happened, being told that the group was pulling a Time Heist. Stark continued to tell the group that it was pipe dream to travel back in time: However, Rogers and Romanoff told him that they could get everyone back by snapping their fingers to do it. Stark still kept himself skeptical for not having a logical set to pull off a time heist.

Stark declines on joining the Time Heist
When Lang sat down with Stark by telling that they will follow strict rules of time travel, he reluctantly rejected his proposal with concern about following logic from Back to the Future, saying that is not how quantum physics works. Despite the group taking a stand to fix what had happened to everyone, Stark still pursued on not joining the heist before Morgan was told to save him by Potts. Rogers told Stark this was their second chance, but he told Rogers that he already has one and still offers them to stay for lunchtime.

Solving Time Travel
Stark wonders on the possibility of Time Travel
At night, while washing the dishes after dinner, Stark accidentally sprayed an old photo of himself and Peter Parker with water and began cleaning it with a rag. Missing Parker's existence and pondering on the idea of time traveling, Stark decided to take it upon himself on testing out one of the theoretical models that would work with Scott Lang's quantum tunnel.

Stark figures out the possibility of Time Travel
Going up to his work table, Stark began working on a Time-Space GPS that would enable the device that could have particle factoring and a spectral decomp to travel through the device. Despite his skepticism, Stark was in complete shock once the device had successfully rendered. Being bewildered by this discovery, Stark let out a swear before noticing Morgan sitting on a staircase and told that she can't swear around the house and should go to bed.

Stark happily gives Morgan a goodnight kiss
Stark told Morgan that he had something on his mind to which she wonders if she wanted juice pops, much to his agreement on getting some after his discovery. After Stark and Morgan finished their juice pops, Stark told her go to bed and sleep before being told to tell a story. After telling a quick a story, Stark told Morgan that he loved her tons before being told back that she loved him three thousand, much to his loving surprise. Once Stark had got Morgan to sleep, he went into the living room where Pepper Potts was reading a book.

Stark talks to Pepper Potts about Time Travel
While talking to Potts and looking towards his lab table, Stark quickly admitted on figuring out how time travel works. Much to Potts' surprise on his incredible discovery, Stark sat down with her and was told they were lucky to have survived, unlike everybody else. Potts told Stark that he can do something about his discovery, but he told her that he could stop trying to save everybody: However, Potts admits that trying to get him stop was one of her failures.

Stark tells Pepper Potts about finally resting
Smiling at the prospect of Potts not giving up on him, Stark admits that sometimes he feels like he should put his optimism in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake so that he could finally rest. Potts then questioned that if Stark was able to rest now to which he decided on helping his team on pulling the Time Heist. Realizing that the chances of survival were improbable and not guaranteed, Stark recorded a parting message to his family in the event that he would die under any circumstances.

Time Heist
Returning to the Avengers
Stark arrives at the New Avengers Facility
Despite Stark's initial refusal to help, the remaining Avengers continued to research the possibility of Time Travel, and attempted to send Scott Lang through time but instead sent time through him, turning Lang into a baby, child, and old man. With no other option to undo the Snap, the Avengers almost lost all hope but just then, Stark arrived at the New Avengers Facility, much to the surprise of Steve Rogers.

Stark shows off his new Time-Space GPS
Once Stark had parked his car in front of Rogers, he rightly guessed that the Avengers' first attempt to time travel was a failure. When Rogers asked Stark why he arrived at the compound, Stark gets out of his car and tells him that the EPR paradox had affected Lang by letting time go pass through him. Rogers guessed that Stark had solved time travel, to which he admitted on inventing a Time-Space GPS. Stark then reconciled with Rogers, noting that resentment is corrosive and he hates it. Rogers says he hates resentment as well.

Stark gives Steve Rogers back his shield
Stark then talked about the conditions of his life before joining the heist, wanting the Infinity Stones to bring back the people who were dead but not having to die trying. As they both agreed, Stark and Rogers reconcile and work on the Time Heist. Before they could work on the heist, Stark gave Rogers back his shield, although Rogers was hesitant, Stark further told him that his father Howard Stark made it for him and he needs to get it out the house before Morgan finds it and takes it sledding.

Stark talks to Rocket Raccoon about his work
Knowing they would get a team together, Stark walked inside the New Avengers Facility with equipment on him, noticing Thor's arrival and made fun of his resemblances for looking like The Big Lebowski. Stark asked Rocket Raccoon on how he was working with the time machine, only to be insulted after mistakenly misnaming him. Stark then produced the Advanced Tech Suit with help from Hank Pym's designs and worked with Bruce Banner to send Clint Barton to the past.

Stark learns of the success of time-traveling
The operation was a success as Barton landed in his homestead at a time before the Snap before returning to 2023. Following this, Stark worked with the Avengers to determine the best times and locations to travel back to. During their brainstorming session, Banner noted they only have enough Pym Particles for one round trip each, and these Stones have a lot of different places throughout history.

Stark and the Avengers settle on the plan
Stark further noted that each group is going through their history which means there were not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in every given timeline. With each brainstorming session, the team's decisions had been concluded being New York City in 2012, Asgard in 2013, and Vormir and Morag in 2014. The Avengers then decided to pull off their heist the following day, prompting Stark to use his helmet to record a message for Morgan Stark in the event that he did not survive. Additionally, he named one of his A.I. systems E.D.I.T.H., standing for "Even Dead I'm The Hero," which he uploaded into one of his glasses. Believing that their efforts to reverse the Snap would be successful, Stark arranged for the glasses to be given to Nick Fury following the latter's resurrection in the event that he died, with the explicit purpose of having Fury hand it down to Peter Parker.

Stark prepares to time-travel to 2012
The next day, as the team had gathered around the circle, Stark and the rest listened up for Rogers' speech about how they lost friends, family, a part of themselves but now they have a chance to get them back. Knowing that this plan is the fight of their lives, Stark looked at Rogers being told that they are going to win for whatever it takes. Once the team was in position, Stark told Banner to activate the tunnel. As the team had finally united on the platform, Stark and his group traveled through time to 2012.

Infiltration into Stark Tower
Stark arrives in New York City back in 2012
The first team, comprised of Stark, Scott Lang, Steve Rogers, and Hulk, traveled back to New York City on May 4, 2012 during the Battle of New York. Rogers informed the group that they all know their positions on where the Infinity Stones are. While they talked about keeping an eye on each other and get out as quickly as possibly, Hulk from 2012 had smashed a Chitauri soldier through wreckage, much to the group's dismay.

Stark furtively infiltrates Stark Tower
Hulk was assigned to find the Time Stone at the New York Sanctum, smashing things along the way to not give any suspicions. Stark and Lang went to Stark Tower to retrieve the Tesseract, while Rogers focused primarily on the Scepter. Stark climbed onto a building and focused on the Avengers from 2012 interrogating Loki. Stark told Rogers to get inside Stark Tower, noted they are almost wrapped up on capturing Loki.

Stark and Ant-Man infiltrating Stark Tower
Stark, with a shrunken Lang on his shoulder, quietly entered Stark Tower successfully without being noticed. While Stark watched his past self and the Avengers clearing from clean up duty and captured Loki, he commented on the size of Captain America's buttocks being crapped into his former uniform. After Black Widow grabbed the Scepter, the STRIKE Team had entered the building, leaving Stark and Lang to hide out of sight. Stark further noted that the STRIKE team was art of HYDRA before quieting Lang's voice.

Stark leads Steve Rogers to the Scepter
Stark then flicked Lang towards his 2012 self in order to get closer to the Tesseract. Once their plan had settled out, Stark proceeded to flee out of the tower and located the Scepter near an elevator so that Rogers could meet up with other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. While Rogers had to capture the Scepter from Agent Jasper Sitwell, Stark managed to get a S.H.I.E.L.D. uniform and went undercover while his past self arrived on the spot of where they met Alexander Pierce.

Stark goes undercover as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent
Stark then ordered Lang that he was on area of where his past self was located and told him to go into 2012 Stark's shirt. While Lang went under 2012 Stark's shirt, he smelled Axe body spray on 2012 Stark's shirt, having 2023 Stark to explain he had one under a desk for emergencies. Under Stark's guidance, Lang entered the inside of his Arc Reactor, and was told to pull the lever that will temporarily give Stark's past self a mild cardiac arrest. When Lang damaged it, Stark's past self suffered a heart attack.

Stark steals the Tesseract from his past self
Using the distraction caused by 2012 Stark's collapse to their advantage, 2023 Stark told the security guards that 2012 Stark needs some help. While 2012 Stark had suffered pain from his heart, 2023 Stark had noticed Lang pushing the briefcase with the Tesseract and began to take it, walking away to escape. Despite successfully obtaining the Space Stone, an enraged 2012 Hulk busted through the door, sending both Stark and the case flying.

Stark wakes up from his punch by 2012 Hulk
The case then popped open and landed at the feet of 2012 Loki, who quickly grabbed the Tesseract and escaped with it. Stark woke up from his sudden knockout, much to his shock from the brute force from Hulk. Lang then jumped onto Stark and told them that part of the plan wasn't supposed to happen, leading him to tell Lang that they messed up the plan. Stark had to go back to the alleyway empty-handed.

Infiltrating Camp Lehigh
Stark admits on the failure of his plan
Lang and Stark met back up with Steve Rogers who had been successful in getting the Scepter. With only enough Pym Particles for a return journey home, Lang lectured the group that they won't be coming home. Suddenly getting an idea, Stark had an idea of getting more Pym Particles to take back the Tesseract, telling Rogers that it is in a military installation.

Stark and Captain America travel to 1970
Stark told Rogers that he doesn't know the exact date but knows where to go but decided to go improvise on which date the Tesseract and Pym Particles were there. Stark begins to set up a date as April 7, 1970 before Rogers entrusted Lang to bring the Scepter to 2023. When Lang told them if they failed, there wouldn't be a way to come back home, Stark dismissed him and began to suit up, leading the pair to travel further back in time to the date that was settled and take the Tesseract that was in possession of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Stark prepares to acquire the Tesseract
Arriving in 1970 New Jersey, Rogers and Stark infiltrated Camp Lehigh, where they discovered a doorway that is holding information in plain sight. Once Stark looked at the doorway closely, he examined the inner walls with his sunglasses, knowing that they could follow them around using the elevator. Stark and Rogers then took the elevator route while a S.H.I.E.L.D. worker looked over to them suspiciously.

Stark discovers the Tesseract in a vault
Once Stark told Rogers good luck once he arrived on the floor that he tracked down, he managed to get inside a facility where the Tesseract had been held through his lenses and eventually found it near a vault. Stark then burned the ridges of the lock and began to capture the Tesseract and put in briefcase that he stole. However, in the attempt, Stark ran into the 1970 version of his father, who was looking for Arnim Zola. Once Howard started asking questions, Stark told him that he was a visitor from MIT, covering up his identity as "Howard Potts."

Stark talks to his father from the past
Despite Stark's success in stealing the Space Stone, Howard engaged his future son in conversation, leading them to take it by going outside. While Rogers worked to obtain more Pym Particles from the 1970 version of Hank Pym, Stark talked to his father about the flowers he was carrying, being noted that Howard's wife is expecting a gift from him after working so long and that a kid is coming along.

Stark talks to Howard about his experiences
Once outside with his father, Stark was told that if Howard's baby would be called Almanzo, much to Stark's surprise and told to take his time. Howard asked his son if he was nervous when his kid was born, responding that he did in fact. As Howard followed up with further questions, Stark told his father that he just raised the kid as what he learned from his father, as they share their experiences with their childhood. Stark then when on talk about what he learned from his father, telling him that no amount money had bought a second of time.

Stark finally reconciles with his father
As they both had reconciled each other's fatherhood, Stark noticed Rogers by the base and noted that he has the Tesseract locked up in a briefcase. With his father ready to leave, Stark told him that it was great meeting him before hugging, much to Howard's confusion. Stark clarified to thank for what he has done for his country and proceeded to leave the camp, finally getting to reconcile with his own father. With the tools to get back home, Stark and Rogers travel back to 2023.

Death of Natasha Romanoff
Stark safely comes back into the present year
The entire team of Avengers have now escape from the past and had retrieve each individual Infinity Stones. Once Stark had arrived back from 1970, Hulk made a brief statement on making sure if anybody had all of the stones. Upon arriving in the present, however, Stark learned that Natasha Romanoff sacrificed herself on Vormir in 2014/Time Heist#1st so that Hawkeye could obtain the Soul Stone.

Stark sadly asks about Black Widow's family
Stark, along with the rest of the Avengers, took a moment of silence once Barton had told the rest of Romanoff's death. After the team had mourned Romanoff's death, they head on by the lake and Stark asked Rogers if Romanoff had any family, Rogers tells him that the Avengers were the only family she has ever gotten. Despite of the team's assurance, Thor was in denial that Romanoff was fully gone, leading Stark to tell him that he just asked a question.

Stark listens to Hulk's speech about the plan
Stark witnessed Thor ranting about getting her back by using the Infinity Stones; however, Barton argued against him considering that the sacrifice can not be undone. While Hulk was listening, he angrily throws a bench, Stark listened on as Hulk claims that they have to not let Romanoff's sacrifice be in vain, before proceeding with their plan to use the stones to bring back the victims of the Snap.

Assembling the Infinity Stones
Stark finishes building the Nano Gauntlet
With help from Rocket Raccoon and Hulk, Stark forged the Nano Gauntlet, capable of harnessing the power of the six Infinity Stones. Once Stark precisely moves all the Infinity Stones with his holographic tech and successfully finished putting them on the Nano Gauntlet, he was completely shocked and happy to finish, before Rocket Raccoon had startled him.

Stark tells Thor to not use the Nano Gauntlet
After settling the gauntlet down on a table, Stark noticed that Thor volunteered to bring everyone back from the dead, only to be stopped on his tracks. While Thor had to explain the team that he felt responsible to save the universe, Stark understood his reasoning but noted that Thor is in no critical condition. Hulk then volunteered to wield the gauntlet, noting what Thanos did with the Infinity Stones, which almost killed him and that none of them could survive.

Iron Man protects himself from the energy
It was decided that Hulk would be the one to wield it, and Stark specified that Hulk bring back the victims of the Snap to their present and not change anything else, fearing that his daughter would no longer exist. After Stark told F.R.I.D.A.Y. to lock down the New Avengers Facility, he watched Hulk put on the Nano Gauntlet and initially struggled to wield the Infinity Stones, while the version of Nebula from 2014 modified the quantum tunnel to allow 2014 Thanos and his forces to arrive in 2023.

Stark uses his coolant blasters for Hulk's arm
Despite the immense pain that he suffered due to his use of the stones' raw energy, Hulk was then able to snap his fingers, but fell to the ground unconscious shortly after doing so. Stark used his suit to cool down Hulk's scorched arm as Ant-Man saw several birds suddenly appear out of nowhere, while Barton received a call from his wife who had initially perished in the Snap, indicating that Hulk was successful in reversing the Snap.

Stark quickly recovers from the destruction
Despite their victory, however, the Avengers were unable to celebrate as 2014 Thanos' ship, the Sanctuary II, had arrived in 2023 and opened fire on the Avengers seconds later, burying the New Avengers Facility in rubble and leading War Machine, Hulk, Barton, and Lang to be trapped inside while Stark, Rogers, and Thor stayed on top. Once Stark survived the rubble, he walked toward Rogers unconscious body on the ground and woke up, giving back his Shield. As Rogers questioned on the situation, Stark grimly commented that messing with something like time had a strong chance to cause backlash.

Thanos' Offensive
Stark decides to confront Thanos in a fight
After the Snap was undone, Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor discovered Thanos from the alternate 2014, who is fully aware of his plan's success and his fate, has arrived on Earth. Stark asked Thor what Thanos has been doing to which he was doing nothing. As Rogers asked Stark where the Infinity Stones are, he noted that they were underneath the rubble.

Stark personally confronts Thanos outside
Thor told the group that his arrival could be a trap, but Stark admitted he couldn't care less. After Thor understood their agreement, Thor summoned his armor and wielded both Stormbreaker and Mjølnir while Captain America and Stark confronted Thanos who was sitting and waiting for them. As the three walk over to confront Thanos, Stark listened to his lecture about how they could not live with their failure and realized that there are those that remember what was, who are unable to accept what can be, much to Stark's agreement as he gloated on their stubbornness to Thanos.

Iron Man swiftly fighting against Thanos
Thanos, having seen the files from Nebula's memory and now believing that the universe would be ungrateful for him "correcting" it, had decided on a new plan to decimate the entire universe and start over with no one remembering the massacre. Stark watched with fury as the Mad Titan proclaimed his new goals, knowing that his universe will be born out of blood before Thanos threatened to kill him and the team. The four engaged in a fight, having Iron Man to equip his hidden blade from his hand and started blasting Thanos with his repulsors.

Iron Man shooting multiple repulsor beams at Thanos
Iron Man then used his extra repulsors from his back and told Thor to blast his lightning from behind, in order to increase the amount of fire power. As Thor began to charge up his lighting powers, Stark was immediately blasted with huge amounts of energy that powered up his suit, aiming at Thanos for an attack. Thanos blocked Iron Man's beams with his Double-Edged Sword and, as he grew closer, broke out of the laser.

Iron Man is knocked out from the battlefield
Thanos used this opportunity to grab Iron Man with both his hands only to witness Thor using Stormbreaker to hit Mjølnir, which he then used Iron Man as a human shield to knock him down and flew him across the field. After he rolled all over the ground, Iron Man was quickly hit by a near pile of rubble which had briefly put him in an unconscious state, becoming stalemated from the fight then on. The other Avengers had to fight Thanos without Stark, leading to one of them getting beaten relentlessly.

Stark witnesses his allies coming back home
While Captain America tried to fight Thanos with all his might, Thanos eventually gained the upper hand and called out his entire army to the ground such as the Black Order, Chitauri, and the Outriders. Captain America stood up against Thanos' giant army alone until Doctor Strange arrived with the reinforcements to battle Thanos' army. Stark then woke up from his concussion and witnessed his allies coming back from the dead, including Pepper Potts in her Iron Suit.

Battle of Earth
Iron Man joins into battle with his revived allies
With the rest of the Avengers in place with all of their allies and other worlds had gathered around to battle Thanos' army, Iron Man dropped down to line up against with them as all began to prepare for battle. Stark landed closely with his teammates and noticed Captain America holding Mjølnir, assembling the team to fight for their planet.

Iron Man fighting alongside with Pepper Potts
The entire team and other forces began to charge with fury attentions, running towards Thanos' forces as he sent his Black Order, Chitauri army, Sakaaran army, and the Outriders to kill them all. Iron Man flew across the battlefield with his allies and began to use his unibeam to attack any nearby threats. Iron Man then teamed up with Pepper Potts, who was donning her own Iron Armor, and fought alongside each other in aerial combat.

Iron Man fighting against a horde of Outriders
While attacking the many Outriders that are trying to kill him from above, Iron Man landed on the ground and blasted many incoming Outriders with his laser beams. While successfully winning his fight, Iron Man was then attacked by Cull Obsidian, landing onto a piece of rubble after getting knocked down. Iron Man tried to kill Obsidian with his repulsors but was proven to be ineffective. Iron Man was then saved by Spider-Man who pulled Obsidian down onto the ground with usage of his Web-Shooters, allowing Ant-Man to crush Obsidian to death.

Iron Man finally reunites with Spider-Man
Stark removed his own helmet to catch his breath after being almost killed only for Parker to give him a hand while he was on the ground. Parker told Stark about himself being in space and was turned into dust moments when he passed out. Parker further noted that Strange was there with him on Titan and began to wake him up to tell the rest that they need him. Stark, who happily grew closer to Parker after listening to him again, silently tells the boy to hold him and hugs him afterwards during the battle that was going on.
