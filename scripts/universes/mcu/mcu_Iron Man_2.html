<html><p>Stark eventually perfected the flight power after much trial and error, taking the silver Mark II Armor for its first test flight as Stark put on the armor for the first time with great pride and excitement. Despite J.A.R.V.I.S.' warnings that there had not been enough tests to be safe, Stark insisted upon being allowed to fly outside and fully test its true capabilities.

Stark tests his Mark II Armor's flight capabilities
Stark cheered in utter delight as he soared high across the sky over California and shouted out in gratification at his success, using the mask's system to zoom into the city where a young boy looked on in amazement upon seeing Stark. However, when he pushed the suit to see how high he could fly in an attempt to beat the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird's record, he learned the suit would freeze at such a high altitude, which disabled its power. Stark fell from the sky and was just able to restart the suit moments before he would have hit the ground, with Stark delighting at avoiding such a near miss.

Stark crash lands through his mansion
Having gained all the information about the suit's capabilities that he needed, Stark flew back to his mansion, where he then prepared to analyze the data to use in the next design. Stark hovered over the entrance of the mansion and prepared to land softly on the ground; however, he did not account for the suit's extra weight and promptly fell through the ceiling, destroying his piano and sports car. Upon crash landing, Dum-E once again sprayed Stark with the fire extinguisher, believing him to have caught fire upon the impact while Stark leaned his head back in both pain and frustration.

Stark finds Pepper Potts' present for him
Exploring his lap, Stark soon found that Pepper Potts had left a gift for him on his desk. Opening the box, Stark found his original Arc Reactor had been framed with a message saying it proved he had a heart. Some time afterward, Stark detected someone trying to hack into his own home computer system, tracing the signal to a corporation satellite. Believing it to be business espionage, Stark then took the skies to successfully destroy the satellite.

Obadiah Stane's Betrayal
Stark learns he was not invited to his party
While giving J.A.R.V.I.S. his plans to improve the Mark III Armor in order to fix the icing problems and improve the flight controls, Stark noticed a news report in which Zorianna Kit was reporting on a new charity event at the Walt Disney Concert Hall which Stark was now supposedly hosting. Stark questioned J.A.R.V.I.S. if he had been invited to the event to which J.A.R.V.I.S. then confirmed he had not, so Stark left his A.I. to complete the Mark III while he got himself ready to attend.

Stark greets Obadiah Stane at his own party
During his first public appearance since his return back to the United States of America, Stark arrived at his own party to be greeted by the press, having an attractive woman trying to speak to him who Stark quickly dismissed as he did not remember her before complimenting the Watcher Informant who he had mistaken for Hugh Hefner. Stark had soon found Obadiah Stane talking to the press as Stane expressed his surprise to see that Stark had arrived, advising him not to draw too much unwanted attention to himself as Stane was still trying to get the board of directors on their side. Stark promised to do so as he stepped inside the building, but Stane was unconvinced.

Stark is introduced to Agent Phil Coulson
Once inside, Stark met Phil Coulson, who introduced himself as an Agent of the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division, with Stark noting that the name of the organization was far too long while Coulson noted that they were now planning on shortening it. The pair soon arranged to have a meeting to discuss all the events of his kidnapping, but Stark was still not paying very much attention to him and told him to arrange it through his own team.

Stark shares a dance with Pepper Potts
Stark, however, was too distracted by seeing Pepper Potts, who he saw in the center of the room wearing a blue dress. Having said goodbye to Coulson, Stark went up to Potts and complimented her on her dress, which she noted she had bought as a present from Stark using his money. Despite Potts' protests, Stark took her onto the dance floor and danced with her, as Potts worried about being seen dancing with her boss. They joked about Stark firing her to make it less uncomfortable, but Potts noted that Stark wouldn't be able to survive without her assistance, questioning if he knew his own social security number which admitted he did not.

Stark shares a moment with Pepper Potts
Stepping outside, Potts confronted Stark about pushing her to dance with her while in front of all her coworkers due to Stark's reputation with women and fearing that her intentions with the dance would be misinterpreted by any who had watched them while Stark continued to argue that it was not really a big deal. As they spoke, the pair then almost kissed one another before Stark decided to go and get them both a drink, with Potts requesting a heavy drink.

Stark learns Stark Industries still sells weapons
While ordering all the drinks for himself and Potts, Stark was then accosted by Christine Everhart, whose name he briefly forgot despite them having slept together. Everhart expressed her disgust at Stark for claiming to halt the weapons development only to sell weapons to the Ten Rings. When Stark revealed he did not approve any shipments, Everhart informed him that his company did.

Stark learns about Obadiah Stane's betrayal
Disgusted by this, Stark confronted Obadiah Stane and demanded to know if he was making deals with Raza as well as the United States Armed Forces. Stane refused to answer the question; however, he called Stark naïve for not considering that this sort of thing could possibly be happening. Stane also revealed that he was the one to shut Stark out of the board while he recovered. Stane then left the party, leaving Stark in a state of utter shock and horror.

Battle of Gulmira
Stark decides to fight the Ten Rings terrorists
Faced with the realization of what his company had done behind his back and Obadiah Stane's part in the deception, Stark went back into his workshop and continued building his armors, while watching a FBX news report on how Raza and his Ten Rings soldiers were using Stark's own weapons to attack innocent people. Angered by what he was seeing, Stark rose from his seat and used his flight stabilizers to smash the glass doors, realizing they could be used as weapons.

Stark puts on his Mark III Armor
Seeking to do something good with the technology he had created, Stark weaponized his Mark III Armor and flew to Afghanistan. Knowing where Raza's men were attacking, Stark headed for Gulmira, the home village of Ho Yinsen. Upon arriving, Stark discovered innocent women and children were being dragged out of their own homes to become slaves for the Ten Rings while the men were being lined up to be executed right in front of their own horrified children.

Stark battles against the Ten Rings terrorists
Stark attacked and easily subdued all of the soldiers, using his advanced weapons systems to kill multiple terrorists with single strikes and saving the lives of innocent people. Having found his former captor, Abu Bakaar, Stark ripped him through a wall and left him for the villagers to gain their own revenge. While Bakaar was being punished, Stark focused his efforts on destroying the Ten Rings entire stockpiles of Stark Industries weapons.

Stark walks away after destroying a Ten Rings tank
During the battle, Stark was shot out of the sky by one of the Ten Rings' tanks, so Stark responded by shooting his own missile and destroying the tank with ease before he then targeted and destroyed all the Jericho missiles the Ten Rings had. The prolonged battle and massive explosions quickly drew the attention of the United States Air Force and his own friend and company military liaison, Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes who investigated the true cause.

Stark is targeted by two F-22 Raptors
Two F-22 Raptors were ordered by Rhodes to take out the unknown target, with Stark soon finding them directly behind him and attempting to lock on with their weapons, forcing Stark to use his new armor's upgraded flight systems to evade the attacks. As the jets continued targeting him, Stark found they had locked on with a missile so used flairs to destroy the missile before it could hit him, being blown forward by the force of the explosion.

Stark attempts to hide from the F-22 Raptors
Having managed to use his superior maneuvering systems to hide underneath of the jets itself without being seen, Stark called Rhodes and revealed his true identity to him in an attempt to have the attack called off, with Rhodes being horrified that he had sent some of his own equipment into an active war zone without informing him. While Rhodes tried to stop the attack, Major Allen, however, order the pilots to take the shot when they could get clear view of him.

Stark successfully saves a pilot's life
However, while trying to evade the attack, one of the Raptors lost its left wing when it accidentally collided with Stark during the chaos of the battle. The pilot ejected shortly afterwards, but his parachute jammed. Without hesitation, Stark dived down to help the pilot release his parachute before escaping. While heading back towards the United States of America, Stark spoke with Rhodes about what excuse he could then use to explain what had happened.

Stark's secret is discovered by Pepper Potts
Once back at his mansion, Stark was then helped out of his armor by both Dum-E and U, finding the experience fairly painful as they struggled to find a way to get him back out. During this, Stark was soon discovered by Pepper Potts who had just walked into his workshop to find him still half in his armor. Stark joked that it was still not actually the worst thing that she had ever caught him doing while Potts was horrified to see bullet holes in the armor.

Next Mission
Stark continues working on his Mark III Armor
With the mission to defeat the Ten Rings a success, Stark went back to work in tweaking the Mark III Armor in improving its performance. He was soon joined by Pepper Potts whom he requested go into his office in Stark Industries Headquarters to hack into the database in order to find out where his weapons were being sold to the Ten Rings so he could go in using his armor and destroy them. Potts, however, refused to help him on his mission as she feared that going into these active war-zones would result in him being killed, but Stark refused to listen.

Stark explains his new purpose to Pepper Potts
Stark noted that for years Potts had stood by his side when he and Stark Industries had been creating the weapons and now, she was planning on leaving once he finally began doing the right thing and protecting the people he had endangered like Ho Yinsen. Stark noted that since his kidnapping he had finally learned what he was meant to do with his life. Hearing how sincere Stark was about this mission, Potts took the hard-drive and agreed to help him.

Stark is left to die by Obadiah Stane
While inside his mansion, Stark attempted to answer a call from Potts when he found himself unable to move. To his horror, he found Obadiah Stane looking down on him while using a Sonic Taser. Stane confessed that he had arranged Stark's kidnapping while he ripped out the Arc Reactor from Stark's chest, causing him to go into cardiac arrest. Stane mocked Stark by comparing him to his father while promising to kill Potts before walking away.

Stark is given back his original Arc Reactor
Having regained some control of his body, Stark desperately tried to make it to his workshop to regain his original Mark I Arc Reactor to save his life. However, Stark collapsed inches away from it and was unable to move and minutes from death. But to save his life, Stark was aided by Dum-E and U who had managed to hand Stark the Arc Reactor just in time. Stark was then found by James Rhodes who he explained the situation to while being helped back up.

Stark prepares to confront Obadiah Stane
Having been told Potts had recruited Phil Coulson and an entire team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to arrest Stane, Stark warned it would not be enough as Stane had his own armored suit. To combat this, Stark put his suit on and prepared to battle Stane. While Rhodes admired the armor which he called the coolest thing he had ever seen, Stark told him to keep the skies clear from the United States Armed Forces while he then flew out of his mansion.

Duel of Los Angeles
Stark fights against Obadiah Stane
Stark flew straight to the Stark Industries Headquarters where he discovered Obadiah Stane was attempting to execute Pepper Potts, so he charged down and knocked Stane aside, crashing into the motorway and then through a Roxxon Corporation lorry. Stane responded by picking up a minivan holding a family and attempting to throw it at Stark, who put all his suit's power into the Arc Reactor to knock Stane back. Having just caught the minivan and put it down, Stark was briefly run over by the family who were terrified by the experience.

Stark hovers just above Obadiah Stane
As Stark recovered, Stane struck again, hitting him with a passing motorcycle and smashing him into a nearby bus. While he was striking him, Stane still continued to mock Stark by claiming that he had built Stark Industries up from nothing back when Howard Stark had been killed. Stane then fired a missile at the bus, as Stark was consumed inside the fireball but was still protected by his suit, despite being launched high into the air.

Stark is chased down by Obadiah Stane
While Stark hovered in the air, Stane complimented him on his upgrades before noting that his armor had upgrades of its own before flying into the air to then chase Stark down. As they considered what to do, J.A.R.V.I.S. had warned that his Mark III Armor would not survive much longer while Stark decided to fly straight upwards, believing that Stane had not done enough tests on his own armor in order to solve all of its own design issues.

Stark knocks Obadiah Stane out of the sky
As they soared higher and higher above Los Angeles, Stark soon found that the superior power of Stane's suit allowed him to quickly catch up with him. However, once Stane had managed to grab hold of Stark, claiming that his own armor was more advanced in every way, Stark revealed to him that he had not solved the icing issue his Mark II Armor had encountered, causing Stane's suit to lose power and then proceeded to fall out of the sky.

Stark is attacked by Obadiah Stane again
Losing his own power in his suit, Stark quickly returned to Stark Industries Headquarters where he attempted to get out of the suit, only to be immediately confronted by Stane yet again. Without one of the gauntlets, Stark found himself at a disadvantage as Stane got him in a bear hug and attempted to crush the suit with Stark still inside, until Stark managed to deploy his flares to briefly blind Stane, allowing him to get away for a moment.

Stark considers how to defeat Obadiah Stane
While hiding from Stane, Stark told Potts that all his current attempts to defeat Stane were not working so he decided to make a new plan. Stark ordered Potts to overload the main Arc Reactor inside the building and blast the roof with energy in an attempt to defeat Stane. While Potts made her way back into the building, Stark also told her to wait until he had gotten himself clear, promising to buy her some time by fighting Stane.

Stark damages Obadiah Stane's armor
Stark proceeded to jump onto Stane's back and ripped out important pieces of the armor, taking out his targeting system and effectively blinding Stane. However, Stane soon managed to rip Stark off his back and then threw him across the rooftop, taking off his own helmet as a result. Stark was then left almost defenseless with barely any power left in his suit to fight back against Stane, who opened up his armor and revealed himself.

Stark blocks Obadiah Stane's gunshots
While he crushed Stark's helmet, Stane began mocking Stark by claiming he had finally made his father proud before shooting at him, with Stark managed to block with his gauntlet before the glass floor underneath him was destroyed. While Stark held on, Potts told him to get off the roof. Stane noted that by trying to rid Stark Industries of weapons, Stark had inadvertently created the greatest one ever while Stane would then use to finally kill him.

Stark nearly dies upon defeating Obadiah Stane
While Stane struggled to aim his missiles at him, Stark ordered Potts to overload the Arc Reactor, which caused a burst of electricity which blasted Stark out of the way while frying the Stane's armor, also killing Stane inside. Stane then fell inside the Arc Reactor, causing a massive explosion while Stark fell unconscious from the ordeal. Stark almost died from the lack of power to his Arc Reactor, but J.A.R.V.I.S. managed to keep him alive long enough to be rescued.

I Am Iron Man
Stark prepares to make a public statement
In the wake of the Duel of Los Angeles as well as his own near-death experience, Stark was aided by James Rhodes who tried to get Stark into an ambulance to see if he had any internal injuries. However, the ambulance was a fake one sent by S.H.I.E.L.D. to retrieve him. Now that they could finally get to talk to Stark, Phil Coulson talked to him after they had dropped him off at a small theater. Coulson viewed Stark's fighting strategy from his fight with Obadiah Stane on a projector screen. He told him he needed to become a real fighter and that he would be trained by skilled S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.

Stark tells the entire world he is Iron Man
The next morning, news had spread of Stark's new alter ego, dubbed "Iron Man" by the press. Stark then held a press conference where Agent Coulson gave him a detailed fabricated cover story about his and Stane's whereabouts and advised him to state that Iron Man was his personal bodyguard. However, during the course of the conference, in a moment of self-clarity, Stark instead announced to the public that he himself was indeed Iron Man.

Meeting Nick Fury
Stark is introduced to Director Nick Fury
That night, Stark arrived home and was greeted by a visitor who was standing by the window. He revealed himself as Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., and assured him that he was not the only 'superhero' in the world, intending to discuss the Avengers Initiative with Stark. However, Stark, uninterested in having the government offering him opportunities, ordered Fury out of the house.

Armored Adventures
Finding World Peace
Iron Man continues protecting the entire world
Iron Man performed acts of heroism around the world. News outlets began crediting him as "the man who stabilized East-West relations" and Stark was chosen as "Person of the Year" by Time magazine. When blackmailed by the Ten Rings and Lina, Stark defeated all of the terrorists and also saved Lina's kidnapped son. When Nick Fury sent a team of United States Navy SEALs to board a ship controlled by the Ten Rings, Iron Man appeared and defeated the terrorists. Stark also helped Thaddeus Ross in saving the pilot of the Aerodynamic Marvel that crashed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In Germany, Stark managed to recover stolen paintings without the use of his armor, all to gain Evetta Gorani's number.

Palladium Poisoning
Unfortunately, Stark's own life was not as good as it appeared, as he was facing a double threat. The first was in the form of his own heart: the Arc Reactor palladium core was poisoning Stark due to overuse of the Iron Man Armor. To maintain appearances, he was forced to drink homemade medicine to counteract the symptoms. Meanwhile, Stark was also aware that the United States Armed Forces were constantly looking to confiscate all his technology.

Starting the Stark Expo
Iron Man entering at the Stark Expo conference
Six months after revealing his own identity to the world and helping maintain world peace, Stark appeared as Iron Man at the grand opening of the Stark Expo in Flushing Meadows, New York City, continuing the legacy his father, Howard Stark, had started. Treating the crowd to the Ironette Dancers and a speech in which he boasted about giving the world its longest running period of uninterrupted peace, Stark left the stage with a video of his father playing.

Stark and Happy Hogan leave the Stark Expo
Stark then left the Expo with Happy Hogan helping to keep the press at bay, signing autographs and meeting Larry Ellison and Larry King on their way out before he was then confronted by a beautiful U.S. Marshal who was waiting beside his car. The Marshal then informed Stark and Hogan that he was now required to attend a congressional meeting in Washington, D.C. the very next day in order to discuss the future of his work as the well-known superhero Iron Man.

Meeting with Senator Stern
Stark and Pepper Potts at the hearing
The second threat was from a senate committee hearing, this time led by Senator Stern, demanding that Stark release the technology of the Iron Man Armor for military application. Stark refused, believing it was not in the best interest of the American people for the United States Armed Forces to possess it since they would use it as a weapon that could very well be used against America if other various countries were able to recreate the Arc Reactor technology.

Stark humiliates Stern and Justin Hammer
Senator Stern tried to turn Lt. Colonel James Rhodes against Stark in an effort to force his decision. Competitor Justin Hammer tried to plead his case on the matter; Stark took this opportunity to embarrass both Hammer and Stern with a collection of footage of Hammer Industries and other entities around the world attempting to recreate the technology. Stark arrogantly stated that it would be years before anyone would be able to successfully recreate his tech and he had "privatized" world peace.

Making Pepper Potts CEO
Stark returns to his Malibu mansion
Returning to his mansion, Stark was greeted by J.A.R.V.I.S. who updated him on the fallout from his meeting with Senator Stern. While Stark listened to the news, he pulled out his Arc Reactor and examined the damaged palladium core which was slowly killing him, with J.A.R.V.I.S. noting that a replacement had not yet been found that could power his many Iron Man Armors and also still keep him alive.

Stark names Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries
Uncertain of his chances of survival, Stark decided to appoint his former personal assistant Pepper Potts into the role he no longer was interested in, the CEO of Stark Industries. When Potts arrived in his workshop, she and Stark had an argument about his own lack of interest in his company and their resources ever since becoming Iron Man, at which point Stark informed her that he had decided to promote her. Although Potts did not at first believe that he was being serious with this idea, Stark had Dum-E deliver some champagne to them as he confirmed that this would be happening and she was the perfect person to take over the job from him.

Stark and Happy Hogan box together
While doing some boxing training with Happy Hogan, during which he used dirty boxing techniques to gain the upper hand, Stark saw the arrival of Potts and a notary from the company, "Natalie Rushman", who was actually Natasha Romanoff, an Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.. Although Hogan hit Stark around the head, he proceeded to kick him away and beat him into surrendering before inviting Romanoff into the ring. Stark looked into Romanoff's eyes before inviting Hogan to train with her instead.

Stark and Pepper Potts discuss "Natalie Rushman"
Stark then sat down with Potts to discuss "Rushman", with him bringing up her "history files" and noting that she even spoke Latin and had once been a lingerie model. While they were speaking, Stark and Potts witnessed Romanoff using a leg move to pin Hogan to the floor, before she exited the ring and asked Stark to sign the paperwork handing Stark Industries over to Potts. Once Romanoff was gone, Stark told Potts that he needed her as his new assistant.

Monaco Grand Prix
Stark and Pepper Potts meet with Justin Hammer
Stark traveled to Monaco with Pepper Potts and Happy Hogan. There, Stark and Potts encountered Justin Hammer, who smugly tried to show off that he was being interviewed by Christine Everhart for an upcoming piece with Vanity Fair; Stark quickly made it clear of his own romantic history with Everhart and noted that Hammer Industries had lost their contract with the United States Armed Forces due to Hammer's embarrassing performance at the senate committee hearing.

Stark questions his difficult life choices
Taking some time away from Hammer, Stark excused himself to check his blood toxicity level in the bathroom. He saw that the Arc Reactor's poisoning of his body due to the levels of palladium was now emitting into his skin. Looking up at the mirror and seeing that he likely did not have much time left until he would eventually die from this poisoning, Stark began questioning what he would like to do with these last few months that he likely had left.

Stark decides to race in the Monaco Grand Prix
Growing increasingly despondent and thrill-seeking as a direct consequence of what he believed to be his impending death, Stark decided to take the Stark Industries car intended for the track and race it at the Monaco Grand Prix. As he stepped into the car, with all the cameras now facing him, Stark gave a look which he knew would be viewed by Hammer, much to his annoyance as Stark would once again be taking the spotlight away from him.

Duel of Monaco
Stark's car is destroyed by Ivan Vanko
As Stark drove around the track, Ivan Vanko, who had successfully constructed an Arc Reactor of his own, along with whip-like energy weapons, attacked him, using the whips to cut off the front of his car and cause it to crash along with several other race cars. Stark had managed to crawl out of the car before it could be sliced in half. Despite his best efforts to fight back, Vanko's armored weapons managed to get the better of Stark, who was defenseless.

Stark considers how to escape from Ivan Vanko
As Vanko prepared to rip Stark apart, he was forced to use his own wits and cunning to escape the deadly whips Vanko was using. Managing to get behind Vanko, Stark struck him on the back of the head with a car door, but Vanko proved to be unaffected, forcing Stark to dodge out of the way of his attacks. He then tricked Vanko into striking the whips onto gasoline, causing an explosion which separated the pair from each other for a brief time.

Stark is saved by Happy Hogan's arrival
With Vanko proving himself too strong to be beaten without his armor, Stark seemed to be running out of options as he was backed into a corner. However, he received aid with the sudden arrival of both Pepper Potts and Happy Hogan, who had driven their own car into the race track and successfully managed to crash it into Vanko, pinning him against the wall and briefly knocking him out cold. Stark then prepared to quickly make his escape.

Iron Man dons his Mark V Armor
However, while Stark moaned about Stark Industries' seeming lack of security at the event, Vanko continued to fight despite still being pinned to the wall and began ripping Hogan's car apart with furious strikes from his electric whips. This forced the terrified Potts to then hand Stark his portable briefcase armor, allowing him to don the Mark V Armor ready to do battle against his would-be assassin in the middle of the track, with Iron Man having the upper hand.

Iron Man being electrocuted by Ivan Vanko
Using his new suit, Iron Man attempted to subdue Vanko by firing his repulsor rays at his attacker, but Vanko was able to block those blows with his own armor before using his whips to strangle Iron Man. Vanko flung him across the racetrack into Hogan's car and then back the other way, tightening the whips around Iron Man's neck and shocking him with volts of electricity, which were slowly destroying the suit.

Iron Man successfully defeats Ivan Vanko
Not allowing himself to be defeated, Iron Man managed to build up his own strength and began wrapping the whips around himself in order to get closer towards Vanko. Once he was close enough, Iron Man punched Vanko in the face a few times before ripping the Arc Reactor out of his chest and crushing it. As Vanko was being dragged away by the police, he laughingly claimed that Iron Man had now lost while Iron Man studied Vanko's Arc Reactor, crushing it in shock.

Meeting with Ivan Vanko
Stark visits Ivan Vanko's prison cell
Afterward, Stark decided to pay a visit to Ivan Vanko personally while he was being held in Batiment B3, France to learn how he had acquired the Arc Reactor technology, being led there by Lemieux. Once they were alone, Stark commented on Vanko's armor and even suggested ways that he could improve it, thinking that he would never actually get a chance to. Stark wondered why Vanko would use the technology to kill him rather than for more tangible personal gain.

Stark and Ivan Vanko speak in private
Vanko revealed that he was the son of Anton Vanko, who had collaborated with Howard Stark on the first Arc Reactor but was deported back to the Soviet Union and died in poverty. Vanko blamed the Stark family for his family's fate, and sought revenge, warning that Stark would die now that he proved Iron Man was not invincible. Stark retorted that Vanko would still be in prison either way. As he left, Vanko mentioned Stark's current blood poisoning, taunting that it was a terrible way to die.

Ivan Vanko's Attack Aftermath
Stark speaks to Pepper Potts on his private jet
Despite Ivan Vanko having been imprisoned for his crimes, the response to another man using the Arc Reactor technology was immediate, with many people, including Senator Stern, commenting on Stark's failure. While on his private jet returning to the United States, Stark made breakfast for Pepper Potts as they discussed the aftermath of the attack. Stark even suggested that he quit being Iron Man from now on and almost confessed to Potts of his current state, but backed out.

Stark is berated by James Rhodes
Stark returned to his mansion where he and J.A.R.V.I.S. continued searching for a new Arc Reactor power source while looking over records of Ivan Vanko and his father, Anton Vanko. Stark learned Anton had worked for Stark Industries in the 1960s before being deported under the orders of Howard Stark whilst Vanko was a Soviet physicist arrested for illegal weapons dealing. He was later visited by James Rhodes, who came to warn Stark about the military's wish to take his suits. However, he recognized Stark's unwell state and assisted him by changing the Arc Reactor's palladium core. Rhodes then tried to convince Stark that he did not have to go through his journey alone but Stark remained skeptical.

Stark shares a drink with Natasha Romanoff
The next night, feeling more depressed about his future as the poisoning neared its peak, Stark considered canceling his birthday party after learning he had only a week left to live. He was then visited by Natasha Romanoff, undercover as "Natalie Rushman", who prepared Stark a drink and gave him a choice of watches to wear. He posed these questions to Romanoff, asking what she would do on her final birthday. Romanoff replied that she would do whatever she wanted, with whomever she wanted to do it with.

Birthday Party
Stark openly flirts with Natasha Romanoff
Stark decided to attend what could very well be his last ever birthday party and quickly got himself very drunk, partying with the many guests who had come to celebrate. He invited Natasha Romanoff, still known to Stark as "Natalie Rushman", to wear one of his gauntlets and fire it at an ice sculpture, taking great pleasure in the destruction before joining the other attendees. Stark then drank even more alcohol shots to become further intoxicated and even harder to keep in control.

Iron Man gets drunk at his own birthday party
While wearing the Mark IV Iron Man Armor and indulging in many dangerous activities, such as using his repulsor blasts to destroy a watermelon, Iron Man was watched by Pepper Potts who attempted to make him stop, being advised by James Rhodes that this was a terrible time to be acting so reckless. Despite Potts taking the microphone away from Iron Man and trying to tell the guests that it was time to go home, Iron Man would not listen to reason and instead insisted that his party keep going as he continued to misuse his suit to entertain his drunk guests within his mansion, much to Potts' and Rhodes' dismay as they looked on in concern.

Iron Man faces down James Rhodes
In the end, Iron Man's actions became more and more dangerous and foolish, forcing his friend, Rhodes, to intervene. Rhodes donned the Mark II Iron Man Armor and ordered the guests out of the room before demanding that Iron Man get out of the suit. Iron Man ignored him and instead requested that Adam Goldstein put on a good song for the incoming fight. The pair clashed as they flew through room to room, using whatever weapons they could find to try and subdue the other, including throwing heavy weights at each other before Rhodes managed to throw Iron Man into his upstairs bedroom.

Iron Man threatens to shoot James Rhodes
Eventually, after almost destroying the entire mansion in the resulting fight, Iron Man managed to subdue Rhodes by smashing his head down on the kitchen counter, before roaring at the onlookers to force them to flee the scene. After Rhodes recovered and knocked him against the fireplace, Iron Man dared his friend to take his shot as they both fired their repulsors at each other, causing a massive explosion. With Iron Man weakened  the fight, he could only look on while Rhodes flew away to deliver the armor to the United States Armed Forces.

Rediscovering the Element
Nick Fury's Help
Iron Man is greeted by Director Nick Fury
In the aftermath of his fight with James Rhodes, Stark took the Mark IV Iron Man Armor and flew to Randy's Donuts in California, buying himself a box of Donuts and aimlessly enjoying them in the middle of the sign above the shop. While he was relaxing in the morning sun, Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., approached Iron Man and ordered him to come inside.

Iron Man talks with Director Nick Fury
Taking a seat inside, Iron Man once again informed Fury that he was not interested in joining the Avengers before rudely asking if he should look at Fury's eye or patch. Changing the subject, Fury then revealed to Iron Man that "Natalie Rushman" was in fact undercover Agent Natasha Romanoff in her Black Widow outfit, who Iron Man tried and failed to fire from Stark Industries. As he and Fury continued their conversation, Black Widow injected Iron Man with Lithium Dioxide to slow down the poisoning in his veins caused by his Arc Reactor. Fury reassured Iron Man that somewhere there was a cure and he simply had not discovered it yet, despite Iron Man insisting that he had already looked everywhere and found nothing.

Stark and Nick Fury discuss Howard Stark
Returning to Stark's mansion, they discussed the history of Anton Vanko who had been working with Howard Stark in creating the Arc Reactor before he was deported for selling secrets on the black market, where he then raised his son, Ivan Vanko, in Siberia. Before he departed, Fury revealed that Howard was one of the founders of S.H.I.E.L.D. and left a skeptical Stark to go through his father’s belongings to find the cure, with Agent Phil Coulson watching over him.

Researching his Family
Stark watches his father's various film reels
Nick Fury gave Stark some of his father's old material to aid in finding a cure for the palladium poisoning. Stark found several items, including Howard's notebook with drawings of a "hypercube" and two Captain America comic books. He remained dismissive and bitter over these past relics until watching an old tape of his father, in which Stark discovered a hidden message where Howard told him that he was proud of his son and viewed Stark as his greatest creation.

Stark has a meeting with Pepper Potts
Stark then drove to the Stark Industries Headquarters, buying some strawberries along the way and met with Pepper Potts, though Bambi Arbogast tried to inform him she was too busy to talk. Once Stark got her attention, he attempted to apologize in his own way, which Potts struggled to believe and insisted she needed to focus on Stark Industries' future. They were interrupted by Happy Hogan and Natasha Romanoff, who were both now working only for Potts.

Stark spots a hidden message in a diorama
As Potts and Hogan left the office, Stark spoke with Romanoff and questioned how she could keep this lie going and she subtly insulted him before leaving. Stark prepared to leave the office, dumping the strawberries into the bin, but first, he thought he saw a hidden message in the diorama of the 1974 Stark Expo, which proved to be a diagram of a new element's atomic structure. Stark disassembled the model and drove it back to his mansion for further study.

Stark finally discovers the secret element
Putting the model on his desk, Stark ordered J.A.R.V.I.S. to make a scan of the model, removing all the trees and buildings from the holographic image so he could focus just on the model itself. As J.A.R.V.I.S. questioned what Stark's plan was, he explained that he believed he had found a hidden message. Eventually, Stark realized that the new element was inside Expo globe in the center and thanked his father for gifting him with it as it would soon save his life.

A New Element
Stark says goodbye to Phil Coulson
As Stark put the final pieces together to begin his experiment, he was greeted by Phil Coulson, who asked where he had been before discovering a prototype for Captain America's Shield which Stark took and used to straighten some of his machinery. Coulson then informed Stark that he was leaving to head to New Mexico to investigate a mysterious object that had been found there.

Stark begins creating the new element
With the aid of his A.I. J.A.R.V.I.S., Stark put his experiment into action, assembling a large laser in the center of his workshop in his mansion. Stark pushed the laser into position, struggling to hold it in place as it shot through the walls while he aimed it at its target. As the laser hit the newly-designed Arc Reactor Stark had made, it finally synthesized the new element. As Stark picked up his creation and studied it, J.A.R.V.I.S. confirmed that the new element would indeed be a suitable replacement for palladium and be able to keep him alive while powering his Iron Man Armors for the foreseeable future. Stark then continued upgrading the Reactor and his next suit.

Stark learns that Ivan Vanko is still alive
Afterwards while Stark continued his work on his new suit, he received a call which turned out to come from Ivan Vanko, despite having last been heard from dying in a prison explosion, revealing he was still alive and bent on revenge. While Stark attempted to trace the call and locate the dangerous terrorist, Vanko promised that he would soon have his revenge for what Howard Stark had done to his father Anton Vanko before hanging up the call.

Stark puts on his newly built Arc Reactor
As Vanko had warned that he had taken Stark's scientific advice and improved his own armor to be ready for their next battle, Stark donned the Mark VI Iron Man Armor. Despite J.A.R.V.I.S.' objections, Stark wore his new Arc Reactor and commented on how it felt putting it on for the first time, noting he got a distinct taste of both coconut and metal. Remembering Justin Hammer's new presentation for the military at the Stark Expo, Stark suited up and flew off to then confront Vanko and stop his evil plans.

Battle at Stark Expo
Iron Man arrives to confront Justin Hammer
At the Stark Expo, Iron Man arrived to confront Justin Hammer, who was busy unveiling his Hammer Drones, captained by James Rhodes in a heavily weaponized armored suit, which was a modified version of the Mark II Iron Man Armor. While trying to keep the audience calm, Iron Man demanded to know where Ivan Vanko was, although Hammer denied all knowledge of him and tried to play off the incident to the audience. Iron Man then approached Rhodes, warning him that Vanko was still alive.

Iron Man attempts to control James Rhodes
Suddenly, Vanko seized control of both the Drones and Rhodes' armor, directing them all to attack Iron Man, who then flew across the Expo in a desperate attempt to lose his attackers and cause them all to crash, while ordering J.A.R.V.I.S. to regain control of Rhodes. During the battle, Iron Man did all he could to save the hundreds of attendees fleeing during the chaos, including Peter Parker, who was mistaken for him by a Drone for wearing an Iron Man mask.

Iron Man outruns the Hammer Drones
Quickly running out of options as Rhodes continued to fire upon him using Hammer Industries weapons, Iron Man tried his best to take out the Drones, flying them all away from the civilians before leading them straight into the main globe in the center of the Expo. Using the his Mark VI Armor's superior maneuvering abilities, Iron Man had managed to escape and cause the bulkier Hammer Drones to crash into the globe and explode all together in a massive fireball.

Iron Man blocks James Rhodes' attacks
However, before Iron Man could relax, he was knocked out of the sky and into an Oracle Corporation dome by Rhodes, who was still being controlled by Vanko. Iron Man attempted to block Rhodes' attacks, holding his mini gun at bay until Black Widow successfully overrode Vanko's programming, having broken into the Hammer Industries Headquarters with a little help from Happy Hogan, despite failing to arrest Vanko.

Showdown with Ivan Vanko
Iron Man helps James Rhodes back to his feet
Iron Man knocked James Rhodes back before Black Widow confirmed that he was safe at last and in control of his own armor. She also complimented Iron Man on his new element which had now stopped his palladium poisoning, causing Pepper Potts to confront Iron Man for not telling her he was dying. While Potts had Justin Hammer arrested, Iron Man helped Rhodes back onto his feet.

Iron Man and James Rhodes fight some Hammer Drones
Knowing that the remaining Hammer Drones would be coming to their location, both Iron Man and Rhodes then came up with a plan to battle them; however, this only led to an argument between the two friends over who should take the better position in the area, with both of them believing that they had the superior armor and skills. However, before they could make up their minds, the Drones then arrived and surrounded Iron Man and Rhodes; with nowhere to escape to, the pair donned their own helmets and prepared for battle, firing their weapons at the attacking Drones.

Iron Man manages to defeat some Hammer Drones
As the battle then commenced, Iron Man and Rhodes found that although they could easily defeat each Drone, the numbers began to overwhelm them. While Rhodes used his impressive weaponry provided by Hammer Industries to destroy the attackers, Iron Man used his top-of-the-range armor to fight back and destroy multiple targets at once, eventually using his lasers to slice all of the remaining Drones in half and finally win the fight.

Iron Man and James Rhodes face Ivan Vanko
Upon eliminating the drones, Iron Man and Rhodes were then informed by Black Widow that they had a new enemy coming in, who she warned appeared to be much stronger than all of the previous ones. This was revealed to be Ivan Vanko in his new, more powerful suit of armor. Attempting to kill Vanko before the fight could even begin, Rhodes armed the Ex-Wife Missile, only for it to fail and not even dent Vanko's armor, with Iron Man then noting that it was clearly a Hammer Industries weapon due to being useless in battle.

Iron Man is almost overpowered by Ivan Vanko
Iron Man then engaged in a fierce battle with Vanko, with himself and Rhodes throwing all they had at defeating him or damaging his armor enough to cause him to surrender. However, they both found that not only was Vanko's armor too strong, but he had upgraded his whips to the point they were more dangerous than ever before. The pair soon found themselves overpowered by Vanko's improved technology and weapons.

Iron Man finds a way to defeat Ivan Vanko
Vanko soon managed to gain the upper hand in the battle when he succeeded in wrapping his electrified whips around Iron Man and Rhodes' throats and slowly tightened them, hoping to break their necks. With no other choice, Iron Man called on Rhodes to use the technique they discovered during the duel at his mansion and fired their own repulsor rays at each other, triggering an explosion in front of Vanko and knocking them all back.

Iron Man stands over the defeated Ivan Vanko
Recovering from the shockwave and getting back onto their feet, Iron Man and Rhodes found Vanko lying on the battlefield, with not only his Mark II Armor but his own body damaged beyond repair. Too injured to continue the fight, Vanko claimed that Stark had in fact lost this fight before he ignited his and all of the Hammer Drones' self-destruct bombs, including one in his own armor. Knowing that these Drones were littered across Stark Expo since he had shot many of them out of the sky, Iron Man quickly flew to rescue anyone remaining there before the Drones exploded and caused major casualties.

Iron Man finally shares a kiss with Pepper Potts
Iron Man raced to save Potts amid the series of explosions, pulling her away just in time. Seeing the chaos that he brought with him, Potts quit her position as CEO of Stark Industries, but Iron Man only teased her about the concept of leaving him before finally confessing how important she was to him, and the couple then kissed each other. Rhodes then revealed he was on the roof too before departing with his armor without serious objection from Iron Man, leaving them where he refused to accept Potts' resignation.

Not a Suitable Candidate
Stark and Nick Fury discuss the Avengers Initiative
At a debriefing, while showing news footage of another superhuman event, Nick Fury informed Stark that while Iron Man was a suitable candidate for the Avengers Initiative, Stark himself was not. S.H.I.E.L.D. wanted Stark as a consultant, but Stark claimed that Fury could not afford his help.

Stark poses with Stern and James Rhodes
Stark thought about the position for a moment and he agreed on the condition that Senator Stern present himself and James Rhodes with their medals for bravery in defeating Ivan Vanko and Justin Hammer. A couple of hours later in exchange, Stark got his wish and took the job as consultant. He took great pleasure in Senator Stern's annoyance at being forced to give him a new medal, smiling for the pictures and offering a peace sign to the crowd of onlookers.

Consultant for S.H.I.E.L.D.
Stark searches for General Thaddeus Ross
Keeping with his job as consultant for S.H.I.E.L.D., Stark was tasked with preventing General Thaddeus Ross from releasing Emil Blonsky onto the Avengers Initiative, ordered by the World Security Council. Stark arrived at the bar where he found a drunken Ross, who was still dealing with losing Hulk, despite his own prolonged search for him.

Stark makes a deal with Thaddeus Ross
The two exchanged insults about each other's recent battles before Stark told him that a team was being put together. Stark annoyed Ross so much that the latter tried to have him removed from the bar, but Stark had already bought and arranged it to be demolished later on, which Stark informed Phil Coulson and Jasper Sitwell on. The task was then completed with Ross refusing to release Blonsky from his custody out of pure spite.

In July 2011, Stark was interviewed by WHiH World News about his dual identity as Iron Man.

Iron Man completes his work on Stark Tower
Stark retrieved the James Rhodes' Mark I Armor and stripped it of all of the new Hammer Industries weapons and turned it back into the Mark II Iron Man Armor. When Rhodes then arrived, Stark informed him that he would never wear that armor again because he made him a new one with improved technology and weaponry. With that, Rhodes became a superhero who dons armored suits like Iron Man known as War Machine. Stark focused his efforts on Stark Tower in New York City which was powered by pure clean energy, with Stark admiring that his own name was lit up.
