<html><p>Coulson's Quinjet then landed on the roof of a building where Bakshi was searching for the Enhanced. Through Deathlok's implant, they were able to confirm that Skye was in the building, though Coulson warned Ward against making contact with her. Coulson then took everyone but Fitz to confront HYDRA. As he and Ward went on ahead, they ran into Deathlok, who had a tussle with an unidentified Enhanced who possessed electrical powers. Deathlok suspected that the young man was protecting Skye and pointed Coulson in her direction.

Coulson surrenders
Before he could reunite with Skye, the teleporter appeared and took her, accidentally taking Calvin Zabo along with them. Agent 33 and the wounded Hunter rejoined them, and Ward asked Coulson what they should do next as both S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA were coming. Ward ordered the others to escape while he stayed behind. Bobbi Morse and Alphonso Mackenzie soon arrived at the scene and Coulson surrendered himself to them.

Bringing the Team Back Together
Coulson gives Robert Gonzales the Toolbox
Coulson was brought to the Bus, where he eventually conferred with Robert Gonzales. When Gonzales asked why he had surrendered, Coulson revealed that he needed Gonzales' help to rescue Mike Peterson and the other enhanced individuals being held by HYDRA. Gonzales asked why he should trust him and Coulson said it was because they both had secrets. Coulson had learned from the Toolbox that Gonzales had a secret hidden in his cargo hold. The two agreed that Coulson and his original team would infiltrate the Arctic HYDRA Research Facility to free Deathlok and Lincoln Campbell. In return, Coulson promised he would open the Toolbox for Gonzales.

Coulson works out a plan
With the deal made, Coulson called for Grant Ward to fly the Quinjet onto the Playground. When he arrived, it was agreed that Ward would have armed guards with him at all times. Coulson, Gonzales and the others watched the feed from Deathlok's eyepiece which showed the HYDRA scientists removing his eye. In discussing the best plan of attack, Gonzales suggested that they simply bomb the base, but Coulson insisted he would not risk the lives of the enhanced prisoners. Coulson's plan was to take a small team to attack the base with Sunil Bakshi's help. Gonzales put the matter to a vote. Anne Weaver and Oliver voted against the idea, but Gonzales and Bobbi Morse voted to move forward. To Coulson's surprise, everyone turned to Melinda May for the tiebreaking vote. She asked to speak with Coulson in private before makes her decision.

Coulson and Melinda May argue
When they were alone in Coulson's office, Coulson confronted May for joining Gonzales. May defended her actions, stating that she had to watch over the Playground in his absence and she did it to protect him. Coulson insisted that he was fine on his own, and May angrily replied that solo was how he operated best. She then demanded he tell the truth about his overseas trips, as Gonzales' people suspected that Coulson was not trying to recruit new agents. She also demanded to know what Theta Protocol was. Coulson refused to answer, stating it was not because he did not trust her, but because she was not Director. May retorted that Coulson was no longer Director as far as anyone was concerned, and admitted that she had personal reasons for her actions. Coulson deduced that she had learned about his secret meetings with Andrew Garner and explained that he only went to him for counseling on his alien writing compulsions. May insisted that he should have told her. Coulson promised to apologize later at length and asked that they focus on the mission at hand.

Coulson defends himself
As Coulson prepared for the mission he was approached by Jemma Simmons who insisted on joining them on the mission. She explained that they would need someone familiar with Mike Peterson's medical history and cybernetic enhancements to treat his injuries. When the team arrived on the Bus they heard a loud thud. They immediately turned their guns on Ward, believing him to have sabotaged the Bus, but it was soon discovered that Skye had been teleported aboard to assist them in the mission.

Coulson listens to Ward's plan
En route to the HYDRA base, Coulson asked Ward to brief them on the upcoming mission. Ward began to explain Sunil Bakshi's role in the plan but then tried to explain and apologize for his actions since being revealed to be an undercover HYDRA agent. He claimed that his greatest regret was that his actions had destroyed the team. Skye, however, made it clear that she was still happy she shot him. As the team neared the HYDRA base, the Bus was targeted by HYDRA's defense systems. Coulson and the team escaped to the Quinjet just as the Bus was destroyed. Landing the Quinjet, they made their way to the base.

Coulson leads the attack on the HYDRA base
Once they arrived inside the base, they regrouped with Sunil Bakshi and prepared for the mission. Skye, Grant Ward, Jemma Simmons and Bakshi were sent to rescue Mike Peterson and the other enhanced individuals. Coulson, Melinda May and Leo Fitz went to take down the base's defense systems so that Robert Gonzales' men could destroy it. While May defended Fitz as he began to hack the defense system, Coulson sneaked away to download HYDRA files containing information about the location of Baron Wolfgang von Strucker and the Scepter. The team regrouped with Skye and Simmons, who had rescued Peterson and Lincoln Campbell. Ward and List escaped and Bakshi lost his life during the mission. The team evacuated just before Gonzales' men destroyed the base.

Coulson speaks to Ward over the phone
Back at the Playground, Peterson and Campbell were treated for their injuries. Shortly after arriving, Coulson received a phone call from Grant Ward, informing him that he preferred the idea of escaping rather than being arrested or having his mind wiped. Ward explained that he knew the team would never forgive him but he believed Agent 33 deserved forgiveness as she was a victim of Daniel Whitehall's experiments. Ward said he was leaving Agent 33 at S.H.I.E.L.D. to rebuild her life as an agent. Coulson promised Ward that he would take care of her and treat her well. Coulson then spoke to Robert Gonzales and Bobbi Morse who were discussing the idea of having enhanced individuals in the base. Coulson honored their agreement and opened the Toolbox before casually mentioning the fact that Nick Fury was still alive.

Calling in the Avengers
Coulson tells Maria Hill to send in the Avengers
Coulson received a phone call from Maria Hill wanting an update on the recent events. Coulson explained that he was keeping Gonzales in the dark about certain details as he felt his method of votes was ineffective. Coulson revealed the location of the Scepter to Hill, who then asked if Theta Protocol was ready. He confirmed that it was ready and ordered her to send in the Avengers to bring down the HYDRA base and capture it and Wolfgang von Strucker.

War Against the Inhumans
Reunification of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Coulson explains Theta Protocol
After the Avengers successfully defeated both Wolfgang von Strucker and later Ultron, Theta Protocol was activated. Both Nick Fury and Maria Hill assisted in the Battle of Sokovia, using the Helicarrier No. 64 to save thousands of civilian lives. After the battle, Coulson was on the Iliad, where he had a meeting with Robert Gonzales and his council. They discussed the recent events and revealed the true history of Theta Protocol. Coulson proposed that he and Gonzales join forces and reunify S.H.I.E.L.D., with Coulson as director and Gonzales and his council as his advisors.

Coulson and Gonzales see the Inhumans
Shortly after this discussion, the alarms on the ship were triggered when the Teleporter and Raina teleported onto the Iliad. They appeared to be searching for what was in the cargo hold. Coulson and Gonzales sent their agents to find them. Gordon and Raina escaped, having failed to destroy the Monolith. At a debriefing, Gonzales revealed that the monolith was alien and had been found on Earth over a hundred years ago. Coulson explained that the only information in the Toolbox about it was the fact that HYDRA was looking for it.

The New Threat
Coulson and his advisors discuss how to deal with the Inhumans.
After Gonzales' people located the Inhumans' home, Gonzales ordered them to prepare for an attack. Coulson convinced him that they should have a meeting with the Inhuman leader, Jiaying, and try and resolve the matter peacefully.

Coulson speaks to Skye about the Inhumans
Coulson met with Skye to see if she knew anything about the Monolith. She assured him that neither she nor Lincoln Campbell knew anything about it. Coulson asked Skye about her connections with the Inhumans and her changing loyalties. Skye suggested that if the Monolith was a weapon, then maybe the Inhumans were just afraid of what Gonzales might do with it. Skye told Melinda May that she had heard the story of what had happened to her in Bahrain and revealed that the two people killed were in fact Inhumans.

Coulson and May discuss the past
Coulson later spoke to Skye and she insisted that S.H.I.E.L.D. not go searching for the Inhumans' home. Coulson said they needed to assess how many Inhumans they were dealing and put them on the Index. Skye persuaded Coulson to let her and Campbell go in first, then she informed him that Jiaying was her mother.

Coulson later found May in the aircraft hanger and they commented on how much they missed the Bus. Coulson told May that Jiaying was Skye's mother, but May had no reaction. Coulson tried to apologize to May for lying to her about Theta Protocol. May did not want to listen. She told Coulson that the little girl who died in Bahrain had not been killed in the crossfire, but that May had shot her before the girl could kill everyone. They discussed their history and how Coulson had lost control when he began carving the Words of Creation on the walls. May told him that Skye was living proof that he had lost control.

Coulson watches Skye leaving the base.
When Skye and Lincoln Campbell prepared to leave the Playground, Coulson spoke to the pair. They discussed the Index and Campbell compared S.H.I.E.L.D. to HYDRA. Coulson insisted that Campbell could trust them.

Coulson briefed the team on the plan for visiting the Inhumans' home. Gonzales objected to Coulson going in, as he had too many personal connections to the people involved. When Coulson tried to argue his case, Gonzales used Tony Stark creating Ultron as an example of what happens when one man was allowed to go unquestioned. The matter was put to a vote and it was decided that Gonzales should be the one to go. Coulson agreed, as he did not wish to ignore the views of his council.

Coulson learns Calvin Zabo has been captured
The team left the base on the Quinjets and Coulson was visited in his office by Alphonso Mackenzie. Mack informed him that he was quitting because he did not wish to work for S.H.I.E.L.D. under Coulson's leadership. Coulson tried to convince him to stay, but soon accepted Mackenzie's choice and let him go.

Coulson watched the mission unfold from his office alongside Lance Hunter and Leo Fitz. Hunter and Fitz remained skeptical of Gonzales leading the mission, but Coulson insisted that he had to put his faith in the council, otherwise S.H.I.E.L.D. would fall apart again. As Hunter and Fitz made some casual comments about the dangers of enhanced people, Coulson said maybe they had been spending too much time together. He was later contacted by Melinda May, who informed him that Jiaying had handed over Calvin Zabo.

Open War
Melinda May told Coulson that they had lost communication with Bobbi Morse. Coulson sent Lance Hunter to investigate. Jemma Simmons entered and told them that Jiaying had been shot, allegedly by Robert Gonzales. Coulson didn't believe that Gonzales would have done that, so he sent the team to learn more and try to prevent the Inhumans from starting a war.

Melinda May was carried unconscious to the Quinjet after a fight with Skye. The council debated whether Robert Gonzales was really responsible for shooting Jiaying. Anne Weaver defended her former Director and revealed that he had gone to great lengths to secure a peace offering for Jiaying. Coulson agreed but still refused to begin a war with the Inhumans. He sent Weaver back to the Iliad to take command, before speaking to Melinda May and Jemma Simmons about Skye's seeming betrayal. He suggested that Calvin Zabo may know the answers. When Zabo arrived on the base, Coulson demanded to know why he was there. Zabo insisted he was a gift from his family. Coulson sent Zabo into a cell before Jemma Simmons revealed that Zabo had taken some kind of drug before arriving.

Coulson later learned through video footage that Jiaying had sent Gordon to take control of their Quinjet to fire upon their city, resulting in the Inhumans believing S.H.I.E.L.D. had attacked their home. He suspected Jaiying of murdering Robert Gonzales. Lance Hunter and Leo Fitz stormed in, having learned that Bobbi Morse had been kidnapped by Agent 33. Hunter and Melinda May were sent to locate and rescue Morse and kill 33 and Grant Ward.

During a video conference with Anne Weaver and Oliver, Coulson once again expressed his desire not to attack the Inhumans. He did not wish to start a war and risk the life of Agent Skye. Oliver argued that leaving Skye with the Inhumans could risk her exposing all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s weaknesses. Alphonso Mackenzie joined the discussion and explained that although he wished to leave S.H.I.E.L.D., with Robert Gonzales dead, he needed to see the matter resolved. Coulson requested time to speak to Calvin Zabo to try to gain information. Weaver agreed and gave him three hours.

Dealing with Calvin Zabo
Coulson questions Calvin Zabo
Coulson visited Calvin Zabo in his cell. Zabo complained he was suffering from the intense cold. When Coulson asked Zabo why he had surrendered, Zabo responded that because Coulson did not have children, he would never understand what a father would do for his child. Coulson asked Zabo how he had slaughtered an entire village. Zabo told him he had done it with style.

Taking a break from the questioning, Coulson went to Jemma Simmons to learn what substances had been detected in Calvin Zabo's Formula. Simmons revealed she had found traces of anabolic steroids, methamphetamine, and liver inhibitors, as well as less conventional ingredients such as gorilla testosterone and peppermint. When Coulson asked if the mixture would kill him, she informed him that a single vial should kill a normal man, and that Zabo had taken three.

Coulson returned to question Calvin Zabo, who was now suffering from intense heat and kept requesting more water. Coulson told him that Jiaying had assassinated Robert Gonzales with the intention of starting a war between S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Inhumans. Zabo refused to believe him. Coulson asked if Jiaying had forced Zabo to inject himself with his Formula as part of the distraction. Zabo divulged to Coulson that it was a formula of his own invention, designed to enhance his strength in order to protect his family. He had taken it of his own free will with the intention of killing as many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as he could.

When Coulson casually referred to Skye as Daisy, Zabo's rage intensified. He claimed that only Skye's family should use her real name. Coulson attempted to reason with Zabo. He pointed out that everything he had done, including wiping out the village and injecting the vials of his formula, was on Jiaying's behalf. Zabo refused to believe he was being manipulated by his wife, claiming that she was not a monster like himself. As he grew more and more angry at Coulson's accusations, his heart gave out and Zabo went into cardiac arrest and collapsed.

Coulson, Fitz and Simmons face off against the enhanced Calvin Zabo
Coulson had Zabo rushed to the emergency room and ordered Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz to try and save him. Simmons injected Zabo with adrenaline, which caused him to have a seizure and fall off the table. When he reappeared, he had undergone a transformation. His appearance was monstous and he had incredible strength. Coulson locked Zabo in the medical pod, but he escaped with little effort. Coulson and Fitz-Simmons shot him with I.C.E.R.s, to no effect. Coulson ordered Fitz and Simmons to flee while he tried but failed to reason with Zabo.

Coulson hitting Calvin Zabo with a car
Calvin Zabo ran amuck through the Playground, destroying everything he came across. Coulson tricked Zabo and pinned him against a wall with a van and a battering ram. Once Zabo was trapped, Coulson again attempted to reason with the him. Coulson told Zabo that they both wanted the same thing, which was to protect Skye. He said he believed Zabo was a good man who was being manipulated by Jiaying. Zabo told Coulson that he had reassembled his wife when Daniel Whitehall had murdered her, but she had never been the same. He explained that Jiaying's power was to take lives to heal and that in the past, an Inhuman elder would sacrifice their own life so she could live on and pass on tradition. Zabo admitted to having slaughtered an entire village to revive his wife and that Jiaying no longer valued human life. Zabo had tried to find Skye in the hope that it would restore his wife's humanity. Coulson asked if Zabo was willing to protect his daughter from his wife, pointing out that Jiaying was out for blood and there was no way Skye would go along with her plan. Coulson declared that Skye was like family to him and vowed to save her no matter the cost. Seemingly angered by Coulson's words, Zabo managed to free himself, but Instead of harming Coulson, Zabo swore to help him defeat Jiaying and save his daughter.

Zabo was held under armed guard. Jemma Simmons helped counteract the effects of his Formula and restored his appearance. Leo Fitz then informed Coulson that while they had been fighting Zabo, Jiaying and an army of Inhumans had taken over the Iliad. Coulson ordered Fitz to contact Lance Hunter and Melinda May, but Fitz told him they had already left on their mission to rescue Bobbi Morse from Grant Ward and Agent 33.

Coulson sees the wounded Bobbi Morse
Fitz later told him that he had invented a device to trap Gordon in a room. As Coulson discussed with Fitz and Simmons whether or not Calvin Zabo was prepared to join them on the mission, they were interrupted by the arrival of Lance Hunter and Melinda May bringing in the wounded Bobbi Morse.

Retaking the Iliad
Coulson fights Gordon
Once Morse was safe, Coulson, May and Zabo flew to the Iliad with the intention of fighting back against the Inhumans. May expressed her disapproval of Zabo's presence, but Coulson insisted his knowledge of the Inhumans would be beneficial and if need be, he could be a powerful weapon for S.H.I.E.L.D. to use. Fitz recognized a code being included in the distress beacon. Coulson knew it was a message from Skye, warning them they were heading into a trap. Coulson ordered the other Quinjets to fall back while his own continued on.

Alphonso Mackenzie cuts off Coulson's arm
Coulson and Leo Fitz found Alphonso Mackenzie protecting the Terrigen Crystals from Gordon, and joined him in the fight. Using Fitz's Quantum Field Disruptors, they trapped Gordon in the room. The team continued to fight Gordon, until the teleporter made a fatal mistake and teleported behind Fitz, causing the iron pole Fitz was holding to be embedded in his chest. As Gordon fell dying, he dropped the Terrigen Crystal he was holding. Knowing that if the crystal broke, it would kill everyone onboard the ship, Coulson dove to catch it. However, the moment he touched it, it began turning his arm to stone. Just as Coulson accepted his fate, Mackenzie used his axe to cut off Coulson's arm, saving his life.

New Objectives
With the Inhuman threat eliminated, Coulson returned to work and began planning out new ways of dealing with threats against the earth. He put his S.H.I.E.L.D. agents into new positions which best supported their views. He brought Andrew Garner back to assess his team and judge their readiness to continue working in the field. They discussed having Alphonso Mackenzie back on the team and in charge of all alien dealings. Coulson teased Garner about getting back together with Melinda May, then Garner handed him a file of his recommendations for Coulson's new program.

Coulson talks to Skye about her new mission
Coulson ordered Calvin Zabo be put through the T.A.H.I.T.I. program, allowing him to begin a new, peaceful life as a veterinarian named Dr. Winslow. Coulson joined Skye as she went to visit Zabo at his new office. Afterward, Coulson asked for her thoughts on leading a new team for people with powers, where they could use their abilities to help protect the world. Skye insisted that if they did this, the team should be kept a secret so the people involved could still live their own private lives. Coulson agreed, noting that his missing arm would be his personal reminder of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s past mistakes.

A New Organization
As new Inhumans started to emerge, Coulson and S.H.I.E.L.D. began the task of trying to find them. However, the first four who emerged disappeared, just as a new U.S. government organization, the Advanced Threat Containment Unit,  was created.

Coulson researches the ATCU
When a fifth Inhuman named Joey Gutierrez gained his abilities in Seattle, Washington, Coulson sent Daisy Johnson, Lance Hunter, and Alphonso Mackenzie to get to him before the ATCU could. While they collected Gutierrez and transported him to the Zephyr One, Coulson stood with the crowd of onlookers. When Rosalind Price arrived and spoke to her subordinate, Coulson took her picture.

Later, Coulson talked to Johnson about how Gutierrez was adjusting to having powers and knowing that he was an Inhuman. During their conversation, Johnson noted how much Coulson loved the new vehicle. The two were concerned about how the ATCU was finding the newly-powered Inhumans before S.H.I.E.L.D. and causing them to disappear.

Coulson talks to Hunter
Coulson met with Mackenzie and Hunter in his office at the Playground. They discussed Price and how she had past relationships with MI6 and the CIA. Coulson asked Hunter to see Bobbi Morse with the technology they had procured from an ATCU soldier, but Hunter refused.

Coulson went to the lab and saw Morse himself. Once there, he asked her about the whereabouts of Leo Fitz. Morse covered for Fitz, but both knew that he was chasing leads on how to free Jemma Simmons from the Monolith. Coulson and Morse devised a plan to talk to Price without her entourage present, since Morse had figured out her routine throughout Washington, D.C.

Coulson meets Rosalind Price
In the Washington, D.C. subway, Coulson and Hunter confronted Price, thinking they had tracked her, but Price had set a trap. ATCU soldiers soon surrounded the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Both leaders exchanged quips. After a few minutes of talking, each leader realized that neither organization was killing newly-transformed Inhumans. When Price's phone rang, Coulson's did as well. Both knew that a new Inhuman had emerged. As Price went to take the call, Coulson and Hunter escaped the subway.

Returning to the Playground, Coulson confronted Fitz on his obsession to save Simmons. Coulson compared Fitz's loss to his own loss of Melinda May, who had never returned from vacation months ago.

Coulson left to watch President Matthew Ellis have a press conference, officially announcing the creation of the ATCU. Coulson noted that the President said the same catch phrase that Price said to him about the "laws of nature" changing.

Rescuing Jemma Simmons
Coulson called Andrew Garner and asked him to assess Joey Gutierrez, to see if he was fit for the Caterpillars program.

Coulson was in the process of putting on his prosthetic hand when he had to run into the room that contained the Monolith. Leo Fitz had broken the seal to the chamber, and the other senior agents were inside trying pulling him out. Coulson berated Fitz for his emotional breakdown, saying he could not afford to lose him to the Kree stone, as he had already lost Jemma Simmons. Suddenly, Fitz ran from the room.

In Coulson's office, Fitz showed the the senior agents that the sample of sand found on him predated the Earth by a billion years. He said that proved the Monolith was a portal and that Simmons was somewhere consistent with that sand. Coulson watched as his agents decided that Simmons had to be rescued. He pointed out that Simmons could be dead, as it had been months since she had disappeared into the monolith.  Fitz was not to be dissuaded. Coulson told Daisy Johnson and Alphonso Mackenzie to stay at the Playground to meet Garner when he arrived. Bobbi Morse volunteered to help Fitz with his search. Coulson observed that she was already helping him, since she had covered for him when he went to Morocco to acquire the scroll. Coulson ordered Lance Hunter to continue on the mission they had previously discussed. Coulson then got his file on Elliot Randolph.

As the others departed on their assignments, Coulson gave Morse the file on Randolph and told her that since he was an alien who had been on Earth for centuries, he might have insight into the Monolith. After Morse kissed Hunter farewell and asked him not to get killed, Coulson told Hunter to assure that Grant Ward did.

Fitz, Coulson, and Morse took a Quinjet to Norway where they found Randolph in prison. He had been charged with being drunk and disorderly. Randolph originally refused to go with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, stating that being an alien was dangerous at the time, and that the jail had a good reading selection and good food. Coulson threatened Randolph, telling him that the Advanced Threat Containment Unit would love to dissect a member of the Asgardians. Randolph noted that Coulson had changed and asked about his hand. Coulson said that he adapted to the changing times. When Randolph used his strength to escape his cell, he told the guards that Coulson had done it.

They brought Randolph to look at the Monolith. He told them that he would escape in order to stay away from the portal, but he had no idea what "Amazon Woman" and "Robot Hand", as he called Morse and Coulson respectively, would do. He then read the scroll Fitz had acquired. With Coulson's permission, he told them to board the plane and take him to England.

Coulson in the English castle
In an English castle, Coulson found a secret doorway that lead to a room specially made for the Monolith. He then called Mackenzie and told him to pilot the Zephyr One to bring them the stone.

Johnson came with Mackenzie when he brought the monolith. She told the others how Garner had evaluated them in their present mental and physical conditions. Activating the Monolith, they saw a portal open, but there was not enough light for Fitz to see to the other side, so Coulson gave Fitz a flare gun which he fired into the void. When the machine sustaining the portal fell apart, Coulson saw Johnson faint. Trying to awaken her, Coulson called Johnson "Skye". Upon regaining consciousness, she corrected Coulson and said her name was Daisy. Morse noted that Coulson was having difficulty in accepting her name change. Fitz realized that the room acted as a sound amplifier and sound opened the portal. Johnson understood what Fitz was saying and believed that she could open the portal with her powers.

As Morse prepared a probe to send into the void, Johnson used her power to open the portal. Fitz, tied to a life line, entered instead. Watching Johnson straining and the life line falling apart, Coulson ordered the others to bring Fitz back immediately. Ultimately, Fitz returned, with Simmons.

Taking Simmons to a Medical Pod, Coulson and Morse determined through tests that she was not contagious and that she was normal after her experience. When Randolph asked Coulson what Johnson was, he told him that she was an Inhuman, a word Randolph had not heard for some time.

Compromising Solution
Coulson, Mackenzie and Johnson discuss Lincoln Campbell
Coulson had Alphonso Mackenzie put a tracker on Lincoln Campbell. When Daisy Johnson came to Coulson, frantic about Campbell being chased by the Advanced Threat Containment Unit, Coulson was not worried. He explained that he had been tracking Campbell since Campbell left the hospital. He watched as Johnson called Campbell asking him to accept help from S.H.I.E.L.D.. Campbell refused, found his tracker, and destroyed it.

Coulson grew tired of "good guys" fighting one another instead of their common foes, so he ordered Mackenzie to get the phone number of Rosalind Price so they could talk. Coulson accessed the line that Price used to talk to the President of the United States and requested a meeting.

Meeting Rosalind Price
At the meeting place, Coulson admired Price's car. Price teased Coulson about his prosthetic hand. Coulson told Price that he knew that she was under pressure from the President to have results, but declaring Campbell an alien fugitive on national news reports was not a good idea. Coulson also knew that Price was hiding something or she would not have met him with such confidence. Price revealed that she knew that Johnson had powers, and, when the time was right, she would have her arrested. Coulson decided to strike a deal with Price. He would work with the ATCU as a consultant if Johnson were left alone.

Coulson returned to the Playground and told Mackenzie and Johnson about his compromise to protect Daisy. The phone rang. It was Price calling to verify Coulson's number.

Working with the ATCU
Divided Attention
Coulson works with Alisha Whitley
Coulson was in a Quinjet with Alisha Whitley, while elsewhere her duplicate, Alphonso Mackenzie, and Daisy Johnson sought to recruit Shane and Lori Henson to the Caterpillars program. Coulson was getting real time information from Alisha, when suddenly the monstrous man appeared and attacked and killed the Hensons. Coulson ordered Johnson and Mackenzie to assist the duplicate as she fought the monster. Alisha lost control of her powers when her duplicate was killed.

Coulson called Rosalind Price and the Advanced Threat Containment Unit to support his S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they pursued Lash. When the two groups ran into each other from opposite directions, Coulson was with the ATCU. Johnson asked Coulson why he was with them and he reminded her that they agreed to work together and share information. Johnson was angry, but Coulson had other concerns.

He had called Leo Fitz and Bobbi Morse to do a forensic investigation at the scene of the Hensons' murder. They gathered samples and brought them to the Playground. There Andrew Garner was evaluating Jemma Simmons and Alisha. After the interviews, Garner accused Coulson of hiding Inhumans from him to fast-track the "Secret Warriors" project. As they talked, Melinda May entered the facility.

Melinda May asks for Coulson's help
May and Coulson met and discussed Lance Hunter having recruited her to assist him in seeking revenge on Grant Ward. Coulson wanted to know if May had left S.H.I.E.L.D. because he was working with Garner. May was more concerned that Hunter was involved in an uncontrollable situation. Coulson assured May that when the time came, he would have a support team ready to assist her and Hunter. On a lighter note, May asked Coulson why he was not wearing a tie. He showed her his prosthetic hand and told her that he was still learning. Coulson sent an agent to follow Garner as added protection against Ward.

Coulson outside Dwight Frye's home
Johnson had found that an e-mail virus was sent to the Hensons from Dwight Frye, a resident of Baltimore, Maryland. So Coulson called Price and the ATCU to meet him, Johnson, and Mackenzie at Frye's residence. During the interrogation, Frye became unruly, so Coulson used his prosthetic hand to hold the man, telling him that he had a finger which could emit a laser. Price wondered if it was true, but Coulson would not verify.

Coulson abruptly left and returned to the Playground. He permitted Johnson and Mackenzie to accompany Frye to the ATCU Facility, to discover what they would do with Frye there. At the Playground, Coulson had Fitz prepare Zephyr One to carry him and a support team to assist Hunter and May in their Attack on Grant Ward. When May asked for an estimated time of arrival, Coulson told her that he was twenty minutes away and suggested that they retreat. En route, a local convenience store exploded and Coulson had the plane diverted to that location.

Visiting the Facility
Coulson retrieved Andrew Garner from an assassination attempt at a local convenience store and brought him to the Playground, where Garner was examined by a medic. Melinda May returned to the facility simultaneously after her Attack on Grant Ward. May was relieved that Garner was alive and wanted to know how he survived. Garner thanked Coulson for saving his life and told them a lie about how he had escaped.

Allowing medics to examine Garner, Coulson left the room and saw May and Lance Hunter arguing. Coulson removed Hunter from the mission to find Grant Wardand put May in charge, since May declared that she was now back with S.H.I.E.L.D..

In Coulson's office, Daisy Johnson expressed her disappointment at not seeing the ATCU Facility and her theory that Lash was a member of the ATCU. Coulson advised her to keep her research into Lash off the radar of Rosalind Price, because he wanted her trust so he could see the facility. Johnson asked him if he and Price were getting close, but Coulson dismissed the idea.

To keep the Playground secret, Coulson had Price pick him up from a street corner. Suddenly, Price received a phone call stating that there was a break-in at her residence. She asked Coulson to allow her to attend to it without him, but he refused to leave her car, telling her that she was lying and trying to delay his visit to the facility. Price allowed him to accompany her.

Coulson at Rosalind Price's home
At her residence, they met Officer Stuart, who asked Price if he could search her place to see if anything was missing. Price told Coulson not to look around, but he did anyway, noting that she owned many biographies of Margaret Thatcher. He found that Price had expensive paintings and a baseball bat with many iconic autographs, but no evidence of theft. Price then brought in food from one of Coulson's favorite fast food restaurants. Coulson accused her of staging a break-in to garner sympathy and delay him from seeing the facility. Angered by his accusations, Price tossed the food into a wastebasket and told Coulson to come with her.

Coulson talks to Price about the way the ATCU is storing Inhumans
Price took Coulson to Endotex Labs, where they watched an Inhuman in an induced coma get locked away in a containment pod . Price tried to justified this action. She told him that they were working on a cure for the Inhumans and would keep them in a coma until they found it. Coulson realized that Price had lost someone. She said that it was her husband who died from cancer. She explained that she wanted to spare these people pain, as she wished she had been able to do for her husband. She then confessed she wanted Coulson to like her, as he had suspected.

Confronting Lash
Coulson and Daisy Johnson argued about the intention of Rosalind Price and the Advanced Threat Containment Unit to cure the Inhumans of their abilities. Coulson said that he was meeting with president Matthew Ellis about the Inhuman threat. He asked Johnson to talk with Price while they headed to the meeting on Zephyr One. Meanwhile, Andrew Garner went to evaluate Joey Gutierrez in the Cocoon. Price came on board Zephyr One and Coulson told her that Johnson would show her around.

Coulson received a call informing him that Melinda May and Garner were missing. Price then helped Coulson tie his tie and he told her why he had a robotic hand. Johnson entered the room and informed him that Lincoln Campbell and Alphonso Mackenzie had boarded. Campbell came and explained that he believed Garner was Lash. Garner was the only person who had access to Jiaying's ledger which contained all the names of the inhumans from Afterlife. Coulson ordered the plane redirected so they could search for Garner and May. Campbell warned them that Garner could be in the process of becoming Lash permanently.

Coulson fights Lash
They soon located May and Garner in an abandoned building at Culver University. With the help of the ATCU, they entered the building and readied the Containment Module. Coulson found the two and saw that May was chained up. He said to Garner that he didn't want to fight against him, but Garner defended his actions and everything he had done against the Inhumans he had killed. Campbell unexpectedly attacked Garner and Garner transformed into Lash and struck back. Coulson gave May a key to release herself and went after them. Coulson saved Mackenzie from Lash and the ATCU soldiers shot Lash. Then Lash threw Price from a great height, and as Coulson yelled, Johnson used her powers to save Price. May calmed Lash down and he transformed back to Garner. May shot him multiple times in the chest, causing Garner to fall into the Containment Module and pass out. Coulson asked May how she knew she wasn't going to kill him. May replied she didn't.

Coulson shares a kiss with Rosalind Price
After the fight, Coulson offered Campbell a position with S.H.I.E.L.D.. Garner was taken by the ATCU to be put in stasis while they searched for a cure. Price spoke to Coulson and offered to buy him a drink. Coulson happily accepted. The next day, Coulson was in Price's home and she suggested that they go out and eat. Coulson agreed and the two kissed.

Operation Spotlight
Coulson and Price oversee the transport of Lash
Coulson's team and Rosalind Price watched as Lash's Containment Module was loaded onto a van headed for Endotex Labs. Coulson questioned if they were doing the right thing. Price insisted they were, since it meant Garner had a chance at remaining human. She promised the ATCU would continue working on a cure. Coulson suggested that she visit the Playground to continue discussing the work of the ATCU. Later, Coulson was asked by Alphonso Mackenzie if he and Price were sleeping together. Coulson refused to answer and told him that he wanted to trust her while the rest of them had to go behind her back.

Coulson briefs his agents on Operation Spotlight
Coulson then summoned his agents and explained that Operation Spotlight was a mission to infiltrate the Advanced Threat Containment Unit base and to uncover its secrets. He assigned each team member a task. After the briefing, he asked Mackenzie if he had answered his concerns, but Mack replied that it had only raised new ones. After that, Coulson welcomed Price to the base and requested that they be able to scan her phone for any viruses. Coulson realized that Price had brought only her normal phone. They continued flirting and teasing one another. The scan sent the information in her phone to the team in Zephyr One.

Coulson shows Price the Playground
In the base's science lab, Coulson told Price about his team's breakthroughs in alien biology as well as robotics and prosthetics. Price received a call, informing her that the Containment Module had caused a security breach in the ATCU base. She asked Coulson if that were true. Coulson said the Containment Module would indeed scan all networks it was near. She informed him that they would shut it down and Coulson told her they needed to find other ways the flirt.

Coulson shows Price his office.
Coulson led Price to his office and he showed her the collectables he had acquired over the years. He was informed by Bobbi Morse that the ATCU was not trying to find a cure for the Inhumans, but was trying to create as many Inhumans as they could. Coulson led Price into the containment room and locked the door. At first, Price thought it was a flirtatious move. She teased Coulson, but he remained serious. He told Price she would now have to convince him that she was not HYDRA and revealed that his team had infiltrated the ATCU base. Coulson tried repeatedly to get the truth from her. She stonewalled and accused him of seducing her to get information.  

Coulson questions Price
Price confirmed that Andrew Garner was not being kept at Endotex Labs. Coulson replied that he believed she was lying, as only a HYDRA agent could know about T.A.H.I.T.I. and he demanded she reveal her source. Price confessed she had fallen for him but accused him of no longer being human, after having been stabbed through the heart. When Coulson informed her that his agents had learned the ATCU was not working on a cure, she didn't believe him. She mentioned that Gideon Malick gave her all the updates from the science division, including the T.A.H.I.T.I. information, thus revealing that Malick was HYDRA. Coulson understood his agents were in danger. He allowed Price to order Luther Banks to evacuate his agents.

Coulson learns the history of HYDRA
After returning to the Playground, the agents gathered with Coulson and Price. Price revealed how she had met Malick in 2001 and he had advised her on many key missions, starting when she worked for NASA. After some research, Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz informed them that they had discovered a division of NASA connected to an ancient HYDRA order obsessed with studying the Monolith. Fitz-Simmons showed them the HYDRA logo in ancient symbols which they had found.

Losing Rosalind
Coulson has dinner with Rosalind Price
Coulson and Rosalind Price had dinner together at her apartment. Coulson lighted candles while Price brought in their meal: Coulson's favorite takeout burgers. As they ate, Price began telling Coulson about her plans for the next day, including returning to her job in the Advanced Threat Containment Unit. Coulson asked if that was the best idea, and Price reassured him that she would be fine.

Coulson heard a sharp sound and looked over to Price's window, which had been broken by a bullet. Looking back at Price, Coulson saw that blood was seeping from a wound in her neck. Coulson dragged Price from her chair and laid her on the ground, begging her to stay with him. Price lost too much blood and died, leaving Coulson shocked and broken.

As he struggled to grasp what had happened, a phone rang. Coulson picked up to hear Grant Ward mocking him for experiencing what Ward himself had felt when Kara Palemas was shot. Ward warned Coulson that he had sent men to kill him and hung up. Coulson had just enough time to call for extraction and hide behind a wall when two men entered the apartment. Coulson shot the two and quickly rigged an explosive to serve as a distraction. The distraction worked and Coulson brought down three more agents, leaving the apartment and jumping out a window. Evading more men outside, Coulson found shelter and exchanged gunfire with the men until Alphonso Mackenzie arrived and extracted him. On the return to the Playground, Mackenzie asked Coulson about Price, but Coulson told Mackenzie to just drive.

Revenge Mission
Coulson questions Daisy Johnson
At the Playground, Coulson told Alphonso Mackenzie to ready the interrogation room, then went to his office without saying anything more. In his office, he looked down at his bloodstained shirt before tearing it off then throwing things around the room. Eventually, he calmed down and returned to his team. He interrogated each member of his original team to see if he could find anything he could use against Grant Ward. Coulson learned that Ward loved his younger brother, Thomas, and that it could be a weak spot to exploit.

Coulson returned to his office and began collecting files. Mackenzie asked him what he was going to do, and Coulson replied that he was about to cross lines the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. should not cross. Coulson then appointed Mackenzie the Acting Director until he returned from his mission.

Finding Lance Hunter with Bobbi Morse, Coulson ignored Hunter's condolences. He grabbed Hunter by the throat and pushed him against the wall. Morse asked Coulson to calm down. Coulson blasted Hunter for not killing Ward when he had the chance. When Hunter apologized and swore he would do anything to try again, Coulson released him and informed him that he and Morse would be joining his mission.

Coulson and Lance Hunter prepare to kidnap Thomas Ward
On the Quinjet, Coulson told Hunter and Morse that their target was Ward's younger brother Thomas. Hunter came up with a plan to rob the jewelry store where Thomas worked and kidnap him. As they flew, Coulson received a call from Mackenzie informing him that HYDRA had kidnapped Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons. Coulson threw the phone against the wall but continued his mission. At the jewelry store, Coulson and Hunter grabbed Thomas and returned to the Quinjet. Coulson called Ward and informed him that he had Thomas and showed him a video feed of Hunter holding a gun to Thomas' head. Once Ward had seen his brother, Coulson terminated the call. Coulson realized he needed to locate Ward, and Thomas offered to keep his brother on the phone long enough to trace the call. Within minutes, Ward called back and Coulson let him talk to Thomas until Morse traced his location. Coulson warned Ward that they were coming and hung up. Dropping off Thomas, the Quinjet continued on to the HYDRA base.

Once over the castle, Coulson watched the thermal scans of everyone in the base, noting that HYDRA had opened the portal and that Ward was one of the people entering it. Coulson began putting on a parachute. Morse tried to talk him out of jumping, but Coulson ignored her and leapt from the Quinjet, falling straight through the open portal and landing on the alien planet.

Battle of Maveth
Coulson faints in Maveth
Upon impact with the planet, Coulson was knocked unconscious. While he lay there, he dreamed of Rosalind Price, who told him to wake up as his team still needed him. Coulson awoke and began his trek in search of Grant Ward and Leo Fitz. Eventually Coulson spotted tracks and followed them until he found Ward and two guards. Killing the two guards, Coulson wounded Ward and handcuffed him, with Ward warning that he was the only one who knew where to return home, and that Fitz was also on the planet. Coulson continued to the exit portal with the prisoner Ward as guide.

As they walked, Ward confided that being on the planet had helped him find his true purpose, accepting that he was a part of a grand plan whereas previously he had looked for father figures in HYDRA and John Garrett. Coulson listened with distaste as Ward told him that he had realized his obsessions over revenge were insignificant, and that he was a part of something bigger. In response, Coulson wounded Ward again, telling him that he had no idea what he meant and the pair of them continued on through the desert.

Coulson finally kills Grant Ward
The two reached the exit point, where Coulson saw Fitz being attacked by Hive. Coulson shot at the man and saved Fitz, but in doing so gave Ward the opportunity to free himself and attack Coulson. Ward was wounded and weak and Coulson overpowered and beat him, reminding Ward of all the lives he had taken. As Coulson fought, Fitz warned him that the portal was closing. Still thinking of all the people Ward had murdered, including Rosalind Price, Coulson made the decision to kill Ward and slowly crushed his ribcage until he stopped breathing. Immediately horrified by what he had  done, Coulson removed his robotic hand and left it next to Ward's corpse. Leaving the body, Coulson returned home through the portal.

Coulson returns to Earth with Fitz
Coulson and Fitz barely made it through the portal before it collapsed, reaching the Containment Module before the HYDRA Castle was destroyed. They returned to Zephyr One with Alphonso Mackenzie and Daisy Johnson and were greeted with joy. While the group celebrated their victory over HYDRA, Coulson embraced Melinda May, while sharing a look with Fitz, knowing Fitz had watched him murder Ward and leave his body to rot on the alien planet.
