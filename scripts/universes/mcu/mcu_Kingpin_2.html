<html><p>When Fisk left the room, he spoke to James Wesley, who instantly turned off his phone and asked about her condition; Fisk told him that Marianna was recovering, despite Doctor Rosenberg having expressed the possibility of further complications. Fisk asked Wesley to call his mother back and ask what she wanted as he had missed her earlier call. Leland Owlsley stormed through security and also asked how Marianna was doing, but Fisk completely ignored him and went back into the room.

Fisk speaks to Vanessa Marianna in bed
Sitting by her bedside, Fisk spoke to the sleeping Vanessa Marianna about his family and religion; he told her about how his father was not a religious man although his mother had wanted to be. Fisk told Marianna about how he had read the bible as a child and tried to find truth and sentiment but found it to be false in his mind, therefore he could not pray for her recovery but could make her a promise which only a possible God could keep him from keeping. Fisk leaned in close to his lover and swore to her that he would make the people who tried to kill her suffer for what they had done.

Fisk attempting to contact James Wesley
Taking a moment to step out of Marianna's room to request a cup of black coffee from his bodyguards, although he refused to be brought any food, Fisk asked to know what had happened to Wesley. He was informed by Francis that Wesley had departed for unknown reasons, having promised Francis that he would return eventually and had asked for no assistance from the other men. Returning to Marianna's room, Fisk attempted to call his friend on the phone, however, he received no answer. After waiting a few minutes Fisk tried again, but once again heard no answer from Wesley.

Vanessa Marianna's Recovery
Fisk waiting at Vanessa Marianna's bedside
The next morning, Vanessa Marianna awoke; Fisk went to collect the doctor but when he saw her confused and in distress, he decided to tell her the truth. Fisk told her what had happened and apologized for getting her hurt as he had believed whoever had organized the attack was targeting him and not her. When he told her that he was sending her away for her safety, she refused, stating that she intended to remain by his side, Fisk had then vowed to find whoever was responsible for the attack and make them suffer, which Marianna fully and happily supported.

Fisk learns of James Wesley's whereabouts
The couple was interrupted when Francis asked for Fisk's attention. Although Fisk made it clear that he wished to stay beside his lover's bedside, Marianna ordered him to leave to deal with the situation as she simply told him she would not be leaving her bed any time soon. Stepping outside Marianna's hospital room, Fisk was then informed by Francis that James Wesley had been located. Fisk asked where his friend was but was mortified to learn that Wesley had been found dead inside of an empty warehouse, with nobody understanding why he had been in there or who had killed him and for what reason.

Fisk is broken by the death of James Wesley
Fisk went to his location and found Wesley had been killed by being shot multiple times in the chest. When Francis revealed that Wesley had not informed him of why he was leaving, Fisk lost his temper and beat Francis mercilessly until Leland Owlsley convinced him to stop. Once he calmed down, the heartbroken Fisk had sat beside the body of his closest friend. He kissed Wesley's forehead and vowed to get revenge, although Owlsley had attempted to keep his mind focused on the endgame before starting a war. Fisk took Wesley's phone and discovered the last call he made was actually to Fisk's mother.

Fisk tells his mother she has to leave
Believing she could get into danger, Fisk immediately had his mother moved from her nursing home to Italy. As he had her driven off, Fisk desperately tried to explain to her the reasons for having her moved but she was upset as she greatly enjoyed living there, did not speak Italian and did not know what she would watch on the television. His mother would often become highly confused by the situation due to her dementia, repeating that it was a beautiful day multiple times, as Fisk continued to hold onto her hand to keep her calm. Fisk asked her about what she had spoken to Wesley about the night before but she had still struggled to recall and repeated herself once again.

Assassination of Ben Urich
Fisk learning of Ben Urich's investigation
Fisk met with Leland Owlsley to discuss what he had learned about who was responsible for the recent attacks; Owlsley claimed that he had been unable to find anything to blame on Nobu Yoshioka's men. Fisk ordered Francis to double the offer for information and keep doubling it until someone talked. He then received a call on James Wesley's phone from his contact at the New York Bulletin in which he learned that Ben Urich had had a meeting with his mother and had likely gained valuable information about his past. With this information, Fisk left the meeting immediately.

Fisk confronts and threatens Ben Urich
Fisk chose to personally confront Urich in his own apartment. When Urich arrived, having been fired from the New York Bulletin, he sat at his computer to write a blog exposing Fisk. Fisk spoke calmly to him, revealing his presence; Urich demanded that he leave but instead Fisk insisted he stay until he had spoken his peace. Fisk apologized to Urich for not taking him seriously before revealing he did indeed have someone at the Bulletin. Fisk mocked Urich's attempts to reveal the story online as he believed that the internet was filled with nothing but videos of cats and unimportant celebrity news.

Fisk furiously strangles Ben Urich to death
Fisk asked Urich if he had been alone when questioning his mother; Urich remained confident, stating he was not easily intimidated. Fisk asked if Urich was responsible for Wesley's death which Urich denied, which did not surprise him. Fisk, however, told him that as he had gone after his mother, he was not here to threaten Urich but was there to kill him. Fisk then launched from his seat and attacked Urich, wrapping his massive hands around his throat. Although Urich did attempt to fight back, before long, Fisk had choked the life out of him and left Urich's body lying in his trashed apartment.

Self Destruction
Fisk caringly tends to Vanessa Marianna
Back in his Penthouse, Fisk cared for Vanessa Marianna, who was still recovering from her assassination attempt. When she asked what he was doing, he told her he was reviewing the funds to have her moved out of the country so he could move the funds back, allowing her to stay with him. Although Fisk had a good understanding of financial paperwork, he became confused at some irregularities, so he called for a meeting with Leland Owlsley to discuss them.

Fisk discovers Leland Owlsley's betrayal
Fisk and Owlsley discussed the final stages of Fisk's plans, with Owlsley stating they would need a replacement for Madame Gao's heroin business as it had been destroyed by the masked man. Fisk asked about the irregularities he had discovered but Owlsley insisted that it was normal; however, when Owlsley tried to hand the papers back, Fisk noted that his hands were shaking and he was sweating. Seeing no other alternative, Owlsley confessed to trying to kill Marianna in an attempt to get Fisk's mind back on the job but denied any involvement with James Wesley's death.

Fisk murders Leland Owlsley in a fit of rage
Owlsley then told him that their partnership was over and Fisk was to hand over half his assets to him. When Fisk questioned why, Owlsley informed him that he had Carl Hoffman, who was willing to go to the police if anything happened to Owlsley. He explained that he had more than enough money overseas for him and his son to never be seen again. Furious, Fisk refused the offer and attacked Owlsley, who defended himself with his stun gun, but Fisk was so angry, he barely felt it. Fisk disarmed Owlsley and threw him down an elevator shaft, killing him before ordering Francis to find and kill Hoffman.

Arrest and Escape
Fisk orders his men to find Carl Hoffman
In the wake of Leland Owlsley's murder, Fisk then scrambled to take control of the situation as quickly as possible. He later received a call informing him that Carl Hoffman had been located in an old church where Owlsley had been hiding him before his death. Knowing that Hoffman could destroy his entire organization if he was able to go to the New York City Police Department, Fisk ordered the closest team led by Corbin to then assassinate Hoffman immediately.

Fisk proposes to Marianna as he is arrested
The team, however, failed with their task and Hoffman was eventually rescued by the man in the mask. Hoffman then went onto the police and exposed Fisk's entire criminal operation and illegal actions with the help of Nelson and Murdock who he employed as his lawyers, directly leading to the arrests of Turk Barrett, Corbin and his fellow corrupt NYPD officers, M. Caldwell, who had been Fisk's contact at New York Bulletin, with Parish Landman, and Randolph Cherryh also then being arrested, as Cherryh still insisted on WHiH World News that they had done anything wrong.

Fisk is taken directly into custody by the FBI
Knowing that following all the sudden developments, there was now nothing he could possibly do to stop him being arrested for all of his crimes, Fisk proposed to Vanessa Marianna just as the FBI broke into his Penthouse to arrest him on racketeering charges stemming from Fisk's skimming off the inflated Union Allied pension funds. While the FBI charged into the building, Fisk put the ring on Marianna's finger and then told her that she held his heart while he was being dragged away, leaving Marianna alone. Fisk was taken outside and put inside the back of an armored van as the paparazzi had surrounded him.

Fisk explains why he cannot save the city
Inside the van, Fisk began reciting a parable from the Bible to the FBI agents inside, specifically the story of The Good Samaritan, in which a man is beaten and left in the dirt, only to be ignored and left to die by a priest and another religious man. Then a Samaritan came and helped the man, caring for his wounds while also then giving him his money. Fisk explained he had always believed he was the Samaritan in the story, but he had learned he was neither the Samaritan or the priest, but he represented the men of ill-intent who had attacked the traveler who had been on a road he should not have been on.

Fisk makes his sudden escape from the FBI
As Fisk finished his tale, the armored van was stopped in the middle of the road and a firefight broke out outside, while Fisk did not say another word and instead just simply sat calmly and waited for his escape plan to finally come into action. When Fisk's men succeeded in eliminating all of the police officers and FBI agents outside, the attackers banged on the door and demanded the guards to open it. One of the guards watching Fisk threatened to shoot him if they got inside, however, he was then shot the other, who had been working for Fisk and entire time and then freed him from his handcuffs.

Fisk makes his way onto Vanessa Marianna
Once the armored van's doors had been opened, the now free Fisk calmly walked to the other van with his armed guards before ordering his men to kill anyone who attempted to follow them, whether they follow on the ground or in the air, uncaring of the lives that would be lost as long as he got his own freedom. As they all continued making their hasty escape, before long Fisk's crew arrived at his warehouse where Fisk was then moved inside the Atreus Plastics van to avoid the detection from the FBI who were currently desperately searching for him throughout all New York City for their escaped prisoner.

Fisk tells Vanessa Marianna to leave the city
Once on the move, Fisk then called Vanessa Marianna, who was still waiting for his arrival with Francis guarding her as they still stood by Fisk's helicopter pad to leave New York. Fisk told Marianna to leave on the helicopter if he was not beside her in twenty minutes, fearing that he could still be found and recaptured, although she insisted that she would not go anywhere without him while they then continued to express their deep love for one another as Fisk continued his journey to her while thinking of them finally escaping from the city to begin a new peaceful life together away from all the crime and chaos.

Duel of Hell's Kitchen
Fisk's van is then ambushed by Daredevil
However, before they could get to Vanessa Marianna and Fisk could finally get away before he then was recaptured by the New York City Police Department, the van was attacked and caused to crash. Fisk fell out of the van, bleeding from his head injury while dazed and confused by the crash, but before he could get back onto his feet, Fisk was then confronted by Daredevil, who told him not everyone deserves a happy ending, which confused Fisk until he soon realized this was, in fact, the masked vigilante wearing a upgraded uniform.

Fisk furiously threatens to murder Daredevil
While Daredevil fought all Fisk's guards who began shooting at him, Fisk then desperately attempted to escape from the scene on foot only to be cornered by his enemy. With nowhere to go, Fisk roared at Daredevil, screaming as he told him how all of had wanted was to make New York City something better than it was, believing that his work to make it into something beautiful before Daredevil had then stopped his plans. Enraged by being confronted by his enemy, Fisk furiously vowed he was going to kill him in revenge for everything he had done, but Daredevil repeated what Fisk had said to him before following Nobu Yoshioka's death and told Fisk to take his shot.

Fisk attempts to beat Daredevil to death
The pair engaged in a fierce and aggressive fight, where Daredevil's speed and agility were equally matched against Fisk's brute strength and determination, with Daredevil flipping over Fisk and kicking him repeatedly while Fisk simply charged into him and threw him across the street. Although his new armor gave Daredevil extra protection, Fisk was still able to nearly beat him to death by lifting him in the air and slamming him down hard before beating him with a metal stick, all the while ranting about how New York City did not deserve heroes but deserved people like his father and to drown within its filth.

Fisk defiantly mocks Daredevil's beliefs
Refusing to give up, Daredevil then managed to disarm Fisk, telling him that the city was not Fisk's to control and was in fact a city under his protection, before using his own batons to then beat him down into submission, knocking Fisk to the floor following repeated strikes to his head and chest. Despite being barely able to sit up following the beating, Fisk had still continued to mock Daredevil's attempts to make any difference with the city on his own while wearing his new costume, which Fisk had called silly, claiming that one man could not make a difference with all of the crime and corruption in the city.

Fisk is finally knocked out by Daredevil
Daredevil just ignored the taunts and threw down his pair of batons, which Fisk then mockingly smirked at. However, with a final furiously hard punch to the face, Daredevil knocked out Fisk and he fell to the ground, finally defeated following his own desperate escape attempt. The still unconscious Fisk was then arrested and finally taken back into custody by the New York City Police Department again as soon as Detective Brett Mahoney had arrived onto the scene and finding him, with Mahoney personally handcuffing Fisk and letting Daredevil escape the scene for him finally bringing Fisk back to justice.

Imprisonment
Dutton's Power Struggle
Fisk being incarcerated in Ryker's Island
Wilson Fisk was taken to Ryker's Island inside an armored van with a team of SWAT officers keeping a close watch over him to ensure he could not escape a second time. When he arrived, with his face still covered with bruises and cuts from his battle against Daredevil, he was ordered by the guards to remove his clothes and personal items for storage, including his coat and his father's cuff-links.

Fisk sits alone inside his empty prison cell
Fisk was then given a white uniform to wear. A guard rudely hit Fisk over the head with his baton as he explained that the uniform which was for newcomers. Once he had his uniform and fresh towels, Fisk was walked down the corridors as the other inmates mocked him, and was led into his prison cell. Fisk could do nothing but sit quietly on his bed, stare at the blank white wall in front of him and begin planning for his eventual return to the city, when he would regain his power and get his cruel revenge on those who took away his life and destroyed his plans for New York City's better future.

Fisk has a meeting with Benjamin Donovan
Fisk later had a meeting with Benjamin Donovan who had warned him that the case was not looking good for him due to the long list of crimes the US Attorney was charging him with, including corruption and bribing. Fisk then asked Donovan about Vanessa Marianna, being assured that she was safe, although Fisk insisted that she could still not be allowed to visit him. Donovan warned him that although Marianna had been sent more than enough money, the government had seized a vast majority of his assets, and advised him to keep his head down and not cause trouble.

Fisk being personally threatened by Dutton
One day, while sitting in his cell and reading quietly by himself, Fisk was visited by Dutton who proceeded to have Fisk's cell door opened by his men so he could mock Fisk's current situation since his arrest. Fisk made it clear that he was aware of who Dutton was due to his reputation as a drug dealer in New York. Fisk was then told by Dutton that although Fisk may have made a name for himself on the outside, Dutton was the Kingpin of the prison and did not wish for Fisk to even attempt to change this, threatening his life if he tried it before walking away with a grin on his face.

Fisk is first introduced to Stewart Finney
Later, in the cafe, Fisk sat alone and watched Dutton from across the room. He was visited by Stewart Finney, who claimed that he wished to meet Fisk as he felt they could help each other, as they were both formerly rich men who were not common criminals and thugs. Finney explained that Dutton ran around eighty percent of the contraband running throughout the prison. Fisk asked about the men Finney had previously sat with, Miguel Valdez and his brother. Finley then explained that they were the violent brothers who had been sent to Ryker's for hideous crimes and also had a sick mother.

Taking Control
Fisk gives Benjamin Donovan his new job
Fisk called for a meeting with Benjamin Donovan where instead of being updated on his current legal case, Fisk ordered him to assist with Stewart Finney's case and pay the rent on Andrea Valdez's home. Despite Donovan's objections as he had previously advised Fisk not to get involved with any criminal activity within the prison, Fisk had furiously ordered him to get it done and ensure that all the transactions were untraceable.

Fisk starting to control of the entire prison
Fisk's plan worked as Finney, Miguel Valdez and his brother became loyal to him as they worked on a plan to assassinate Dutton and take over the prison. Despite Finney assuring Fisk that there was currently no way to get in Dutton's cell block, he did hand him the latest copy of the New York Bulletin which featured an article on the Punisher's trial and then conviction for the murders of various criminals which had included the Kitchen Irish, the Mexican Cartel and the Dogs of Hell. Fisk and Finney had then searched for any possible connection between all of these gangs and Dutton's own criminal career.

Fisk demanding to meet with the Punisher
Fisk recruited the assistance of Roy Olsky to ensure during the trial the Punisher pleaded guilty and was sent to Ryker's Island. Fisk had another meeting with Donovan to move all of his remaining funds to bribe the guards into joining his side, although Donovan warned that any other money he would need would for these criminal dealings be have to be taken from Vanessa Marianna's protection, Fisk, however, assured Donovan that he would not need any more money after this was completed. Donovan then asked if he wanted to know what the Punisher would be doing but Fisk still did not answer him.

Recruiting the Punisher
Fisk first introduces himself to Frank Castle
While exercising in the outdoor gym alone, Fisk was visited by the newly arrived Frank Castle. Fisk explained how he had followed Castle's case in the New York Bulletin before he tried to comment on how he felt the deaths of Castle's family was a tragedy but was ordered to stop as Castle insisted he was not allowed to mention his family as Castle claimed that he did not believe Fisk really had any sympathy for him and insisted Fisk get to the point.

Fisk recruits Frank Castle to murder Dutton
Fisk moved on and discussed Nelson and Murdock who had handled Castle's case in the courtroom and had tried to claim that Castle was suffering from PTSD from his experiences. Fisk offered to help him to find some closure instead, claiming he had found a sense of empathy while inside Ryker's Island for those who had been wronged by the law. Fisk informed Castle that Dutton had some kind of connection to the massacre at the Central Park, explaining that despite the fact that he was not part of either the Kitchen Irish or the Mexican Cartel, he had undoubtedly had a hand in all of their activities.

Fisk exposits his ideal plan to Frank Castle
Fisk explained how Dutton was in another cell block within Ryker's which he now essentially owned and was constantly surrounded by guards and inmates alike, which Castle in insisted he did not care about. Seeing his rage build, Fisk then offered Castle a chance to kill Dutton to avenge his wife and two children; when Castle questioned why Fisk did not kill Dutton himself, Fisk claimed that he desired to be unnoticed while in the prison so that he could do his time and then return to New York City. Castle at first refused to help, knowing that Fisk would personally benefit if Dutton was to be killed.

Fisk finally convinces Frank Castle to help
As tensions rose, Miguel Valdez and his brother stepped out onto the gym floor to back Fisk up, but Castle was unintimidated. As Castle still refused to be a mobster's personal assassin, Fisk argued that he should consider all of the enemies he had within the prison already and Fisk was giving him the perfect opportunity to confront the man implicated in his family's deaths. With this in mind, Castle then finally agreed to help and Stewart Finney stepped forward and gave Castle a shiv and they explained that Roy Olsky would assist him in getting into Dutton's cell block to confront and kill him.

Betraying Frank Castle
Fisk betraying Castle and leaves him to die
Fisk ensured his plan went as planned, and Frank Castle successfully assassinated Dutton by stabbing him with the shiv Fisk had provided, while learning that the Blacksmith was responsible for the Massacre at Central Park. When Castle returned, Fisk ordered Roy Olsky to lock the door, trapping Castle as Olsky unlocked the other cell doors, allowing all Dutton's loyal men to find his body. As he watched this unfold from the higher level, Fisk tauntingly thanked Castle before then leaving him to die by being beaten to death by all the other violent inmates who were still loyal to Dutton.

Fisk privately meets Frank Castle in solitary
Castle survived the assassination attempt and killed every attacking inmate. Having witnessed this, Fisk made a new plan for Castle using his talents for violence to Fisk's own advantage. Fisk visited Castle while he was locked inside solitary confinement with his arms and legs in chains, and even ordered the guards to wait outside. Castle confronted Fisk over trying to have him killed, which Fisk confessed would have been easier but noted that considering the state Dutton was found in then he had likely given Castle all of the information on his own wife and two children's deaths as he had wanted.

Fisk is furiously attacked by Frank Castle
Fisk was asked as to why he had left Castle alive and he explained that he had changed his former plans for Castle due to the changing circumstances, admitting he was wrong. Fisk told Castle that he had a gift for violence which he now wanted to exploit, noting he had not believed the stories of the Kitchen Irish and Dogs of Hell massacres he had committed. Fisk explained that he intended to use Castle's violent nature, but Castle, insulted, attacked by headbutting Fisk, but Fisk soon overpowered him due to Castle's chains and Fisk then furiously beat him into submission before stepping away.

Fisk offering to allow Frank Castle to escape
Once they had both calmed down in the wake of the clash, Fisk gave the order to some of the prison guards standing by that all of Castle's hand and ankle cuffs should be removed before he offered Castle the chance to escape from Ryker's Island and use all his skills to kill the crime rings in New York City so Fisk would have no longer have any rivals when he finally got free. Castle agreed, promising that one day he would target Fisk himself, with Fisk calmly replying that he was counting on it. Fisk had then allowed Castle to steal a guard uniform and walk free to then continue his violent crusade once again.

Fisk staying beside the dying Dutton's bed
With the Punisher gone to continue his crusade in New York City, Fisk then went to Dutton's bedside and ate his steak dinner beside him while Dutton struggled to breathe on life support. Fisk explained to Dutton that his wounds were indeed fatal and he would soon suffocate on his own blood. Fisk promised that Dutton would not suffer alone, as he felt Dutton had been right previously, that in prison there was only room for the one Kingpin to take charge. Dutton died shortly after this exchange and Fisk took command of the prison, doubling the cut of the guards and gaining even more influence than Dutton had ever had as Kingpin of the entire prison.

Matt Murdock's Visit
Fisk being questioned by Matt Murdock
Once Matt Murdock arrived at Ryker's Island to question Fisk, being brought in by Benjamin Donovan, where Murdock explained that he knew that Fisk was behind Frank Castle's escape, which Fisk initially denied as he claimed to have no interest in the Punisher's activities. Fisk continued to deny any involvement, leading to Murdock threatening to use the law to keep Vanessa Marianna out of the United States of America and ensure that Fisk never saw her again.

Fisk attacks and threatens Matt Murdock
This threw Fisk into a rage and caused him to rip off his handcuffs and brutally slam Murdock's head against the table multiple times. Murdock attempted to fight back; however, he was not a match for the vastly stronger Fisk, although he did punch him, leading to Fisk remembering that Murdock's father was a boxer. Fisk admitted to taking control of the facility and allowing Castle to escape before telling Murdock that once he is free, he will dismantle his life, as well as Foggy Nelson's, and that Castle's actions should be the least of his current worries. Murdock left Fisk shortly after.

Fisk plans to destroy Nelson and Murdock
While eating a perfectly cooked steak and drinking wine in his prison cell later that night while two other prisoners stood guard outside, Fisk took a sip of wine and was hurt by the cut on his lip from the earlier punch. While re-examining the cut Murdock left on his lip, Fisk seemingly remembered the same damage being inflicted upon him by Daredevil when he was arrested. The suspicious Fisk told Miguel Valdez that he would like to re-examine Murdock's files while he began planning on how he would destroy Nelson and Murdock and get revenge for his current situation in Ryker's Island.

Manipulating the FBI
Dealing with Ray Nadeem
Fisk sits alone while still within Ryker's Island
As his long imprisonment within Ryker's Island continued, Fisk was told that his mother died, leaving her box of memories, including the hammer Fisk used to kill his father. Fisk also attempted to distract himself by imagining he was inside of his own Penthouse, where he could make his traditional omelette in the morning. However, Fisk could still hear the other inmates over his classical music as he made himself breakfast, although Fisk could still furiously yell out to all of the other inmates to be quiet.

Fisk being updated about Vanessa Marianna
Fisk was rejoined by Benjamin Donovan and Nicholas Lee who came with news that his appeal was still continuing as they had planned, although Fisk suspected that they actually had more to tell him than just this. Reluctantly, Donovan and Lee then informed Fisk that there had been some more setbacks with bringing Vanessa Marianna back to New York City so they could be reunited as the FBI now wanted to charge Marianna as an accessory to Fisk's crimes, so she would be arrested as soon as she returned. Disappointed by this update, Fisk demanded Donovan and Lee go as he considered what to do.

Fisk goes to his next scheduled FBI meeting
As usual, Fisk was then called into his meeting with the FBI as they still attempted to get new information out of him about the criminal gangs who operated within New York, which Fisk had always refused to assist them with. This day, Fisk had been greeted by Agent Ray Nadeem who was clearly unimpressed by getting assigned to meet with Fisk since he had been refusing to help them for some time. Fisk, however, asked Nadeem if he was in love with anyone and what he would do to protect them, which Nadeem had briefly mistook for Fisk threatening his family, although Fisk calmly assured him that this was not the case, commenting on all of the mistakes he had made.

Fisk requesting a deal with agent Ray Nadeem
Fisk claimed that he was accepting the dept he was paying due to his many mistakes, but told Nadeem that he refused to accept that Marianna would have to pay for all those mistakes as well by being forced to never return to the United States of America and for them to never see each other again. As Fisk said he would do anything to protect Marianna, Nadeem then questioned exactly what he meant, as Fisk asked to make a deal with the FBI. Fisk gave the FBI key intel on the Albanian Syndicate, resulting in the arrest of the Mother Teresa and other mobsters which Nadeem took credit for.

Staged Assassination Attempt
Fisk works out while inside of Ryker's Island
In order to get out of Ryker's Island, Fisk had used his influence over the prison to convince Riggle to allow Jasper Evans to make an attempt on his life, believing this would allow Fisk to convince the FBI that prison was too dangerous. As part of this plan, Fisk put himself in a vulnerable position as he went to Ryker's gym.

Fisk comes close to murdering Jasper Evans
As was pre-planned, Fisk allowed Evans to come close to him, under the guise that Evans was assisting with Fisk's exercise, before Evans drew and shiv and plunged it into Fisk's stomach, causing non-fatal wounds while also screaming that Fisk was now the snitch so that everyone else in the prison could hear him. However, Fisk responded to this attack with pure rage and, despite this being pre-planned, Fisk threw Evans away from him and considered killing him in retaliation, trapping him underneath the barbell he was using and kicking him in the head, before almost striking the terrified Evans with a weight.

Fisk after getting stabbed by Jasper Evans
With Evans trapped and defenseless, he cried out in utter terror and begged for his life while Fisk stood over him, furiously holding up the weight over his head and considering crushing Evans' skull with it. However, Fisk then eventually recalled the plan and chose not to kill Evans, instead of dropping that weight down just inches from Evans' head and going to sit back down. Fisk then took a seat while all the prison guards arrived, taking control of the situation. As a reward for his own involvement with the scheme, Fisk had Riggle write up his false paperwork that Evans was sent to their solitary confinement, when in reality he was freed from Ryker's and returned home.

Moved from Ryker's
Fisk being checked on by agent Ray Nadeem
Following the stabbing, Fisk was rejoined by Ray Nadeem who first checked on Fisk's condition following the incident, noting that he had spoken to all the doctors at Ryker's Island who had just told him that the wound was not fatal. When Fisk commented that he found their new situation quite profound, Nadeem demanded that he not start with his mind games, although Fisk claimed that he found the situation to be extremely serious, noting that he had never before feared being attacked.

Fisk requests his transfer from Ryker's Island
Fisk commented that everyone in Ryker's knew that he was talking to the FBI and was, therefore, a snitch; however, Nadeem made it clear that the FBI still expected Fisk to continue cooperating with them to bring down more organizations like the Albanian Syndicate, noting that if he did not, then the FBI would not clear Vanessa Marianna of all criminal charges. Manipulating the situation to his own ends, Fisk reminded Nadeem that he had become a target within Ryker's and if he remained there he would likely be killed and then would be unable to help the FBI anymore, demanding a renegotiation of the deal.

Ambush on the FBI Convoy
Fisk is surrounded by Ray Nadeem's agents
With the FBI believing that Fisk would remain in serious danger if he was allowed to stay in Ryker's Island, a deal was renegotiated as Benjamin Donovan had managed to convince the FBI to allow Fisk to be taken out of Ryker's and instead moved into the Presidential Hotel as they could still keep Fisk under constant guard by the FBI as long as he was being kept there. As he was being prepared to be moved, Ray Nadeem complained about all Donovan's many demands before Fisk was lead out of the facility.

Fisk soberly tells Ray Nadeem about love
While they drove down the streets of New York City, Fisk listened to Nadeem as he explained the rules of his imprisonment at the Hotel. However, rather than acknowledging what Nadeem was saying, Fisk began talking about his own life and how he had spent much of that alone, believing that this was the source of his strength and how he achieved so much. Fisk noted that despite all his successes, he felt unfulfilled until he met Vanessa Marianna, telling Nadeem that he felt like he would explode just from the sense of almost overwhelming amount freedom and power that his love for Marianna brought.

Fisk is caught up in a sudden explosion
As he continued talking about his love for Marianna, Fisk said that he discovered the great lie behind love, in that the freedom it seemingly gave him was, in fact, the opposite. Fisk told Nadeem that while their literal prison presented a challenge for a prisoner to escape, love was the truly inescapable prison. Concluding his long metaphor, Fisk told Nadeem that due to his own love for Marianna he was always in his prison, but regardless of this, if he could do anything more to protect Marianna, then he would do that, as nothing would be a challenge for him as long as it had ensured that Marianna could remain safe.

Fisk sees the Albanian Syndicate attack him
However, just as Fisk concluded his metaphor about love, a sudden explosion then destroyed the car in front of them, before the second fireball rolled their own vehicle onto its back, knocking both Fisk and Nadeem unconscious. Fisk soon awoke, still handcuffed to his seat and found that Nadeem was still out cold, as Fisk then desperately attempted to free himself while calling out to Nadeem. Before long, bullets began striking the car's bulletproof windows as the Albanian Syndicate attempted to kill Fisk, who then used brute force to rip his handcuffs free, despite having nowhere he could escape to.

Fisk finding himself now completely trapped
From inside the bulletproof vehicle, Fisk watched the surviving FBI Agents fight against the Albanians, who still had them completely surrounded and managed to take them all down one by one, as one agent ordered Fisk to stay in the car before getting shot in the head. The Albanians then all surrounded Fisk's car, and began firing at the windows, aiming to kill Fisk in revenge for having both Vic Jusufi and the Mother Teresa arrested, as another Albanian sawed through the car door while Fisk prepared himself for a final and likely fatal fight with seemingly no hope of surviving this attack on his life.

Fisk's life being saved by Benjamin Poindexter
However, just before the Albanians could get inside Fisk's car, a shot rang out and took out an Albanian as Benjamin Poindexter stepped out and used pinpoint accuracy to shoot and kill the Albanians. Fisk continued to watch while Poindexter proved to be an extraordinary marksman, ricocheting bullets before brutally executing two men who surrendered to him and even throwing his magazine cartridge into another man's throat. With all this going on, Fisk finally managed to get out of his car, as Poindexter held his gun to Fisk and told him not to move, while Fisk had calmly raised up his hands.

Fisk being escorted into the Presidential Hotel
Now seemingly safe from harm, Fisk and all of the surviving agents were rescued by more squad cars as they drove at full speed through New York City until they reached the Presidential Hotel, as they then pulled Fisk straight inside while Fisk asked to make a phone call as Nadeem and Poindexter ensured that the area was safe for them to proceed. As he was moved, Fisk overheard Arinori complaining that five agents had been killed in that attack because of Fisk. Fisk saw that Donovan and Nicholas Lee were there as he then demanded they go and ensure that Marianna was safe.

Fisk then got inside the elevator with Nadeem and Poindexter as he was moved upstairs to the Penthouse where he would be continuing his sentence, finding that it was filled up with security cameras and a team of agents outside to ensure that Fisk could not leave. Nadeem explained the situation and promised that he would be safe there, Fisk complained that he had almost been killed that night, to which Nadeem responded by furiously grabbing Fisk's collar and reminding him that several good FBI agents had been killed while protecting him, demanding that Fisk's intel had better be worthwhile.

Once safe inside of the Presidential Hotel, Fisk was able to take his shower as he considered what had happened during their Ambush on the FBI's Convoy, recalling how his life had been saved by Benjamin Poindexter and his incredible shooting abilities. However, before Fisk could even finish his shower, he was interrupted by the arrival of Arinori, who informed Fisk that both of his lawyers from Donovan and Partners had just arrived, as Arinori threw Fisk a towel and had ordered him to then get dry and dressed.

Heading downstairs, Fisk found Benjamin Donovan waiting to speak to him with Nicholas Lee, as Fisk immediately questioned if they had been able to locate Vanessa Marianna. Although Donovan requested that the cameras be shut off so that he and Lee could speak to their client in peace, Fisk told them not to worry about all that and instead just finally tell him whether or not the Albanian Syndicate had indeed targeted Marianna. However, to Fisk's utter horror, Donovan had then regretfully informed him that they did not know if Marianna was safe as she had gone missing, as Fisk began worrying for her safety.

While he waited for an update on Marianna's situation, Fisk sat alone in his Penthouse and stared at the blank wall in front of him, being reminded of Rabbit in a Snowstorm.

Getting to the point, Fisk questioned where Marianna was now, while Lee explained that she was in a safe house in Barcelona, which had greatly annoyed Fisk since he believed Europe was too dangerous to hide Marianna due to the risk of extradition; however, Donovan had explained that it was Marianna's decision as she enjoyed the art and could be quite insistent. Briefly reminded of Marianna's nature which he found so attractive, Fisk calmed down before then demanding to Donovan and Lee get back into contact with Manning in order to get Marianna moved into somewhere safer and even closer to him.

New Allies, Old Enemies
Fisk acknowledging his own condolences
That evening, Fisk had been served his plain dinner by J. Lim, who had called him an asshole, while Fisk remained under the close watch of Benjamin Poindexter, who would barely look at Fisk as he was stood guard. Instead of eating, Fisk simply addressed Poindexter directly, commenting on how Poindexter had saved his life from the Albanian Syndicate's men the night before, to which Poindexter claimed that was a mistake. Fisk expressed his condolences for the lives of the FBI agents who died protecting him, acknowledging his own condolences would likely bring a little comfort to all of their families.

As Fisk continued talking, Poindexter simply ignored him, while Fisk had commented on how brave the men who lost their lives were, with Poindexter only speaking up to remind him that he only had five more minutes to finish eating that meal. Fisk then commented on how he owed all those fallen FBI agents a debt that he could never repay, but noted that he had also owed Poindexter a great deal, commenting on how Poindexter was incredibly skilled with a firearm, but Poindexter chose to ignore Fisk's questions about his talents as he instead took Fisk's food away from him and then left the room with all his food.

That evening, Fisk was rejoined by Benjamin Donovan who claimed that he had just been attacked by a masked man who Donovan had suspected was actually the Daredevil, as Donovan told Fisk how the masked man had taken out six FBI agents and, despite not wearing his red suit, he had little doubt that this was the same man. Having heard this, Fisk stepped over to his Penthouse's window and looked out over New York City, commenting that the Devil of New York had finally returned and was seemingly aiming to bring down his criminal empire once again, much to Fisk's considerable frustration.

That morning, as Fisk knew it would be, Lim and Poindexter charged in Fisk's bedroom to do a random room search, with the two agents surprised to find that Fisk was already prepared and facing the wall as was instructed by the time that the entered the room. While agent Lim began the search, Poindexter had explained the current situation to Fisk and demanded that Fisk would corporate with the situation, which Fisk calmly accepted while Lim proceeded to throw Fisk's bed onto the floor during his search, while Poindexter had then searched Fisk's entire body for any potential weapons that he might have.

Eventually, Lim's search of the room and Poindexter's search of Fisk himself was concluded while Fisk and Poindexter had then directly faced each other at the end of their search, both clearly sizing each other up, with Poindexter calmly confirming that the room was now indeed all clear. Fisk then watched while Poindexter and Lim left his room, watching while Poindexter momentarily paused while stepping out of the Penthouse, locking eyes with Fisk who was stood on his balcony and kept a closer eye on the agent, as Fisk still considered what benefits Poindexter could hold for him in the near future.

As Murdock tried to talk his way out of that situation, Fisk reminded him of how he threatened Vanessa Marianna the last time they had spoken, before Fisk left Murdock to fight his way towards freedom, ensuring that even if Murdock had made it back to his taxi, that taxi would still be driven into a river where Murdock would drown. That same day, Fisk had his daily food delivered, finding that agents J. Lim and Benjamin Poindexter had chosen to take a bite out of his burger before it was delivered, which Fisk ignored as he continued to eat the burger with his spork regardless of Poindexter and Lim's prank.

While he was eating his meal, Fisk was joined by Tammy Hattley as well as Winn who had come to talk to Fisk about the Ambush on the FBI Convoy on Poindexter's involvement with it. As Hattley and Winn questioned Fisk about what happened, he was asked about the men he saw who surrendered before Poindexter executed, with Fisk then telling Hattley and Winn that those men had tried to kill Poindexter before he killed them in self defense, which Hattley and Winn simply accepted. Once he was alone, Fisk looked up at one of the cameras, assuming that Poindexter would be watching what he had said.

Fisk making his case for Benjamin Poindexter
Following this interview, Fisk sat alone in the Penthouse and read the New York Bulletin until he saw all the cameras in the room being shut off. Poindexter then burst into the room and questioned what Fisk's game was. Fisk claimed that he was not offering Poindexter favors, but sympathy, noting that while Fisk himself could handle the insults and mockery that the papers like the Bulletin could throw at him, he believed that an agent like Poindexter would struggle with that the press would say, to which Poindexter then noted that despite all his confidence, Fisk still did not actually know anything about him.

Fisk, however, simply showed Poindexter the Bulletin's report about the Ambush, which suggested that the FBI had botched the transfer, knowing that this would add to Poindexter's paranoia about being used as a scapegoat for the FBI's failure. Fisk made this point clear, noting that the FBI were now investigating Poindexter for just simply doing his job, complimenting Poindexter on his outstanding work in saving his life as well as Ray Nadeem's life during that ambush, as he claiming that the FBI were now trying to demean Poindexter's act of courage, before the confused Poindexter then walked away.

Framing Matt Murdock
Fisk learning of Matt Murdock's lucky survival
Fisk was later informed by Benjamin Donovan that despite his best efforts, Matt Murdock had seemingly survived his taxi being driven into a river since his body had not been recovered, much to Fisk's great frustration. Considerably annoyed, Fisk told Donovan to go and remind Felix Manning that he did not tolerate loss ends; however, Donovan still attempted to reassure Fisk that Murdock's corpse was likely just swept away in the water, noting that even if he had gotten free of the taxi, there was no way that any blind man could have then swum back onto the shoreline following such a brutal crash.
