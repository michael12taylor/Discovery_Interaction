<html><p>Master Scientist: Foster has become one of the most important astrophysicists in the world, having studied the existence of Einstein-Rosen Bridges, also known as wormholes, since before discovering their true nature through her experiences with Thor. Once he departed from New Mexico, Foster developed a revolutionary theory on wormholes known as the Foster Theory. She began to give lectures around the world, and she was even considered a serious candidate for the Nobel Prize.
Equipment
Phase Meter: Foster used this device to measure the cosmic energy anomalies within the Nine Realms. This device was used when Foster came across a series of portals created due to the Convergence.
The Reality Stone flowing within Foster's body
Reality Stone: A strange red liquid, which was actually one of the Infinity Stones, that absorbed itself into Foster's body, using her as a host to draw from and grow stronger. While fused with Foster, the Reality Stone would release a violent blast from her body to protect itself. It was finally extracted from her body by Malekith, as well as Rocket Raccoon in an alternate timeline.
Magnetic-Propulsion Ball: An Asgardian toy that Foster believed could be a scientific breakthrough for Earth.
Gravimetric Spike: A device designed by Erik Selvig to stabilize the focal point of the Convergence and pass by its effects. Foster planted these devices to teleport the Dark Elves away, stalling their plans.
Vehicles
Campervan: To be added
Dark Elf Harrow: Following Malekith's attack on Asgard, Foster joined Thor and Loki as they commandeered an abandoned Harrow left by the Dark Elves. As they escaped in the ship, Foster fainted and was carried off the ship to the Asgardian Skiff.
Asgardian Skiff: After departing from the Dark Elf Harrow, Foster boarded the ship with Thor and Loki as they escaped from Asgard to Svartalfheim and travelled to confront Malekith.
Facilities
Culver University: Foster attended Culver University as a student and would eventually graduate.
Foster with Thor in her Research Base
Smith Motors: When Foster moved to New Mexico to look into anomalies out in the desert surrounding Puente Antiguo with Erik Selvig and Darcy Lewis, they operated out of a lab to conduct their research. When they met Thor, they allowed him to stay at the base with them. The base was completely emptied out when S.H.I.E.L.D. arrived to confiscate their equipment, but later returned it so Foster could work from the base for S.H.I.E.L.D..
Foster reunites with her team in her apartment
Jane Foster's Apartment: Originally her mother's place, Foster moved in to the apartment after she was called London by Erik Selvig. Foster used the apartment as her lab, although she found herself spending all her time moping around, still hung up about Thor. When Foster returned to Earth, she went back to her apartment where her team formulated a plan to stop Malekith. After the Convergence, Foster witnessed Thor arrive at her apartment to live a life with her on Earth.
Royal Palace of Valaskjalf: When Thor discovered something to be wrong with Foster, he brought her to Asgard to help her. After learning the that the Aether was inside her, Foster was allowed to stay on Asgard for safety, given her own chambers, which she was imprisoned in temporarily after the Sacking of Asgard.
University of London: When living in London, Foster found employment at the University of London, where she would continue her research in astrophysics, the Nine Realms and the Convergence. Thor visited Foster at the University, where she brought him to the observatory, telling him about her research.

Trivia
In the comics, Jane Foster eventually took up the mantle of Thor after he lost his ability to wield Mjølnir and was stripped of his powers.
Natalie Portman desired the role of Foster because the character is an astrophysicist in the films despite being a registered nurse and medical doctor in the comics.
Behind the Scenes
Chris Hemsworth hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live on 7 March 2015 in which he portrayed Thor in an Avengers-themed skit. During the skit, Thor refers to Jane Foster as his "ex", leading some to speculate that they had broken up between the events of Thor: The Dark World and Avengers: Age of Ultron. Chris Hemsworth later clarified that Thor and Jane were still together during that time in an interview.
Dorenda Moore, Elsa Pataky, Ashlee Fidow and Zia Kelly were stunt doubles for Natalie Portman in the role of Jane Foster.
Faye Sewell was a stand-in for Natalie Portman in the role of Jane Foster.
Portman expressed interest in having Foster appear in The Avengers but her pregnancy at the time meant that she couldn't appear in the film so her absence was explained as her working at an observatory in Norway alongside Darcy Lewis.
According to Natalie Portman, the reason for which Jane Foster wasn't written into the story of Thor: Ragnarok was because of its setting: Obviously, I wasn't written into Thor: Ragnarok because of where it took place. It wasn't really on Earth, and my character is on Earth.
Natalie Portman did not shoot any new footage for Avengers: Endgame, only recording a new line that Jane Foster speaks when heard speaking from a distance, and all of the footage of her is recycled from Thor: The Dark World. The film's first draft had Jane talking with future Thor upon meeting him during the Time Heist, but Frigga ultimately filled that role. A scene featuring a conversation between Jane and Rocket Raccoon in which the latter tries to explain her what he is going to do before taking the Reality Stone from her was cut.
A.C. Bradley originally pitched an episode of What If...? featuring Jane Foster's transformation into Mighty Thor, but her idea was nixed because Taika Waititi was keeping it for Thor: Love and Thunder.
Natalie Portman revealed in an interview with Vanity Fair that for Foster's transformation into Mighty Thor in Thor: Love and Thunder, she trained with Naomi Pendergast for four months prior to filming and throughout the entire filming process: "We did a lot of weight training and a lot of protein shakes—heavyweight training that I haven’t ever done before. Of course, I've never really aimed to get bulky. It was very physical, so it was a lot of both agility work and also strength work. It definitely helps you get into character, and it's definitely changed the way I move. You walk differently; you feel different. I mean, it's so wild to feel strong for the first time in my life."
