<html><p>When they entered Bakuto's office, Rand questioned what Bakuto's motivations were for the Iron Fist, although Bakuto insisted that they were not using people at his compound. Taking a seat, Rand noticed an ominously familiar knife which he had seen at Harold Meachum's Penthouse. Slightly alerted, Rand continued his conversation with Bakuto as he was praised for his action in Rand Enterprises dealing with the Leishmaniasis Cure as he noted how the world was run by companies, it was good to have a man with moral values, noting that Bakuto was certain that Rand would turn his company around.

Rand and Bakuto discuss Iron Fist's power
Bakuto showed Rand a recording back in 1948 as he explained that during World War II a group of Chinese soldiers had inadvertently gotten lost in the mountains, and there the soldiers had unexpectedly encountered the Iron Fist who was guarding the pass and defeating all of the soldiers with considerable ease while only using his bare hands charged with the Iron Fist. Rand had watched as the recording showed a fully-trained and realized Iron Fist who had just furiously dominated his opponents, as Bakuto noted that this was what Rand had the potential of being if he fully realized his own power.

Rand listens to Bakuto's obsession
Rand turned to Bakuto and asked why he was so interested in the Iron Fist as Bakuto had then explained that he had spent his entire life listening to the masters' stories about the Immortal Weapon and became obsessed with learning about the powers of the Iron Fist. Although Rand claimed that Bakuto might have the wrong man if he wanted Rand to be a guard; however, Bakuto had instead offered a partnership with Rand to protect all his students from Gao and her deadly Heroin. Bakuto claimed that this was his motivation, but Rand had remained somewhat uncertain of trusting Bakuto just yet.

Rand is called by Harold Meachum
Following his private talk with Bakuto, Rand had then received a call from Joy Meachum who gave the phone to Harold Meachum who it turned out was still alive despite Rand having previously found the pool of blood at his Penthouse. Rand learned that Joy knew about her father's secret and that they were working on a plan to regain control of Rand Enterprises. Rand informed Harold about Gao and Bakuto, much to the great relief of Harold as Rand had promised to confirm if Gao was dead or being kept locked away, claiming that Bakuto was a friend, although he still remained uncertain.

Terrible Discovery
Rand talks to the students in the compound
As Rand kept exploring the Compound to get a sense of the people, he was greeted by Darryl who asked if Rand was joining them as he said that he was thinking about it. Rand learned from Darryl that he enjoyed staying in the Organization and he was well-treated and the quality of life was great, introducing him to Gil and Ciara. Rand also learned that there were a few areas they were not allowed to go and that there was a curfew, as Rand decided to investigate.

Rand sneaks around inside the compound
Looking for answers, Rand sneaked into the compound protected by guards without being seen, and had eventually managed to find out where Madame Gao was located. As Rand approached Gao's cell where there was a video communication as the old woman rose from her chair and greeted Rand as he told her that he was glad that Gao finally got what she deserved, but Gao replied that punishment was juvenile and boring. Gao then continued to chid Rand for his childish thinking, as Rand mockingly replied that at least he was not in prison, although Gao had then asked Rand if this looked like prison.

Rand talks to Madame Gao about the Hand
Gao berated that she offered Rand freedom and leniency to live his life: however, he chooses and instead, he pursued her to China where he had kidnapped her and then ran directly into slavery, calling Rand an idiot, as Rand stated that she was baiting him with insults. Gao told Rand that she was only treating him with respect by being who she truly was and not everyone around him was the same, but Rand did not believe her. Gao warned Rand that 'they' were stealing his ability to trust and, when Rand questioned who, while smiling, Gao replied it was the Hand, much to the complete horror of Rand.

Rand is caught on sight by Bakuto
Shocked, Rand asked what she was talking about. Gao urged Rand to open his eyes and question where he was. However, before Rand to ask more questioned, Bakuto appeared as he acknowledged that Rand found what he was looking for. Rand defended that he was only looking for some answers to which Bakuto replied that he would not find them here while speaking with Gao, claiming that he already had tried himself, but he was glad Rand had tried so he could see for himself that Gao would not work with them or against them. Bakuto then led Rand out of the compound and back to his room.

Rand personally questions Colleen Wing
As Rand found Colleen Wing was waiting for him, she could see that something was troubling Rand as she asked what was wrong. Rand answered that he went to talk to Gao and how she had continued to manipulate him, as Gao had made him question everything. He told Wing that Gao told him that they were in the Hand, noting that the knife he saw in Bakuto's office was a Hand Ceremonial Knife which he had seen Alexi and Vando using. Following a brief silence, Wing revealed that she wanted to tell him from the beginning, proving that Gao was telling the truth and Wing was a member of the Hand.

Rand furiously argues with Colleen Wing
Shocked, confused and then devastated by Wing's deception, Rand had a hard time listening to Wing as she tried to explain. He furiously stated Wing that the Hand were murderers and killers while Wing defended the denunciation and explained that it was all Gao's action as she was part of a rogue faction committed criminal activity that destroyed lives like selling her Heroin. However, Rand did not accept the story as he sorrowfully told Wing that she had been lying to him the whole time. Then, Rand started questioning if Wing was ordered by Bakuto to meet him in the Central Park, but Wing denied it.

Rand asks if Colleen Wing works for the Hand
He further asked if she was ordered by Bakuto to allow Rand to stay in the Chikara Dojo as Wing tried to reassure Rand that there wasn't a conspiracy as Wing claimed that she already met him and already developed feelings for him. Rand asked if that was before or after she learned about him being the Iron Fist, but Wing insisted it was before. Still unable to trust her, Rand asked if it was Bakuto's idea to sleep with him and recruit him into the hand but once again, Wing had continued to deny this, while Rand retorted that the only reason why people were interested in him was because of the Iron Fist.

Rand feeling betrayed by Colleen Wing
Rand asked why Wing lied as she replied that it was because Rand had been brainwashed by the Order of the Crane Mother against the Hand, as she urged Rand to think of whenever someone mentioned the Hand, he went to fight them with a reckless and rashed attitude, reasoning that he grew up in K'un-Lun hearing only one story about the Hand which was a lie forced upon him, urging Rand to consider the possibility that the story was wrong. Bitterly, Rand had reminded Wing that the Hand had killed his family. Feeling utterly betrayed by someone he loved and trusted, Rand then left Wing alone.

Escape from the Hand Compound
Rand meditates to recharge his Chi energy
Later that night, while he was still attempting to process everything that he had learned about all of the terrible lies he had been told ever since arriving in New York City, Rand had attempted to meditate in his room in order to recharge his Chi energy, while Colleen Wing was sleeping on the bed beside him. Hearing some instinctive chatter that had gained his attention, Rand then quietly went to out investigate. Making his way through the Hand Compound, Rand ensured that he was not being watched as he eventually had found his way down to the locked off basement by managing to locate a secret entrance which did not require a passcode.

Rand discovers the Hand's monitors
Once downstairs, Rand had discovered several cameras, monitors, and voice tracking from all the locations he had been since his return, including the Chikara Dojo as well as Harold Meachum's Penthouse. In absolute fury, Rand destroyed the monitors, enraged at the sheer rage about all of deception he had discovered. While Rand continued furiously breaking the equipment, Bakuto emerged and expressed his disappointment as he hoped that Rand would not take the bait. Rand angrily rebuked Bakuto for keep lying to him but Bakuto only replied that he was simply testing Rand to which he had just failed.

Iron Fist furiously fighting against Bakuto
The furious Rand the attacked Bakuto, at first throwing a key board at him which Bakuto easily avoided. They then exchanged blows, with Bakuto using his speed to avoid the Iron Fist's attacks and using his rage against him. Bakuto had then armed himself with two blades which he began swinging at the Iron Fist with great force, damaging some stone pillars in a furious swing. Before long however, the Iron Fist managed to disarm him and when Bakuto had attempted to do a flip, he knocked him down and made him crash hard on the ground; however, Bakuto's soldiers were already coming to his aid.

Rand seeing Davos fighting in front of him
Now that he knew the Hand's intentions were malevolent and that he needed to escape and warn his allies about what he had discovered, Rand began heading out, only for the alarms to begin ringing out throughout the compound as before Rand could even get out of the basement, he encountered a few students who were there to stop him. However, as Rand prepared for the fight, Davos then suddenly appeared and knocked them out as he chastised Rand for being the worst Iron Fist ever before then moving ahead. Confused by his best friend's appearance, Rand then followed closely behind him.

Rand and Davos are surrounded by the Hand
As the two friends moved ahead, Davos explained Lei Kung tasked him to bring Rand back to K'un-Lun. He asked who the people were, Rand had answered that they were the Hand, to which the horrified Davos vowed that they would kill as many of them as they could on their way out of the Compound. The alarm continued and guards started appearing, as Rand and Davos then found themselves being surrounded by the guards and managed to fend them off by working as a perfect fighting unit, even when the sheer number of the Hand's soldiers came close to overwhelming them in the tight corridor.

Rand and Davos escape Bakuto's compound
They hurried outside where Davos made the plan as he had advised Rand to use his Chi summon up the Iron Fist and smash through the gate to get out. Rand warned that they would be seen as Davos said that he would hold them off for as long as he could. Seeing that Rand was still tensed, Davos had tried to calm him down by reminding his friend that stealing apples from Master Q'uon was harder than what they were about to experience. Together they had charged towards the gate in order to make their escape; however, Darryl appeared to block their path, as Rand had tried to get him out of the way.

Rand realizes that the Iron Fist does not work
During the scuffle, Rand was stabbed in the side by Bakuto, an act witnessed by Colleen Wing. When Davos broke Darryl's leg, Rand tried to help him before Davos convinced him otherwise as they instead continued making their way towards the exit. The two friends reached the gate and Davos urged Rand to summon the Iron Fist; however, Rand found himself unable to summon his powers. As more and more guards arrived, the situation got worse as Bakuto calmly explained that Rand's anger, pain, and confusion had destroyed his chi, leaving him completely unable to access the Iron Fist no matter how hard Rand tried to calm himself down and concentrate.

Iron Fist battles against all Bakuto's soldiers
Enraged, Rand then charged ahead to face his opponents as Bakuto ordered his students to attack them. Both Rand and Davos faced the swarm of Hand cultists, each using the skills which had been taught by the Order of the Crane Mother to fight alongside each other with excellent coordination, as Rand and Davos managed kept the Hand at bay. When more Hand soldiers appeared, Davos then leaped over Rand's back to push them away, before getting into a fighting stance and commenting that this was not what they had planned. Despite proving themselves to be the superior warriors, Rand and Davos had soon found the sheer number of Bakuto's soldiers overwhelming as the had soon begun to lose their advantage during the fight.

Rand following Davos in his escape
In the midst of their fight however, someone opened up the gate for them to escape through. Davos then prevented Rand from keeping fighting his opponents as more reinforcement appears. They both went through the gate while a few cultist followed them through the gate as it closed again. Davos quickly dispatched them, as Rand turned and saw Wing in the control room, having opened the gate for them to escape. Confused, before Rand could talk to her, Davos had insisted that they needed to keep moving as the two then escaped the Hand's compound before Bakuto could capture them.

Rand being furiously confronted by Davos
As they reached New York City in the early morning, Davos told Rand that he needed get stitched up before they returned to K'un-Lun, but Rand refused. Davos reminded Rand that the path to K'un-Lun was open and that he was not there to protect it as Rand insisted that he could not leave. Davos pointed out that Rand had no trouble leaving them, which Davos reprimanded Rand for. Davos continued that they should head back and submit to the Thunderer who could hopefully restore Rand's Chi, noting Rand was a complete failure as he could not even light up the Iron Fist due to his previous mistakes. Hearing this, Rand held his bloody wound, knowing Davos was right.

Davos' Confrontation
Rand examines his wound at a bathroom
Taking refuge while still running from the Hand Compound, Rand had then taken a moment to enter into a bathroom where he lifted up his shirt and examined the wound given to him when Bakuto had stabbed him. Rand attempted to restore his Chi so he could regain the Iron Fist, but visions of the Cave of the Dragon, the betrayal of Bakuto, screams of pain from Darryl as well as his final look at Colleen Wing caused Rand too much emotional distress for him to focus.

Rand asks Davos on how he found him
Rand and Davos then hid in an empty parking lot while Davos urged that they should hurry return to K'un-Lun as soon as possible so his father, Lei Kung, could restore his chi. Rand had asked how his old master was and if he was pissed off over his action, to which Davos replied that Kung was troubled, confused over Rand's abandonment and was indeed angry. Rand asked how Davos managed to find him. Davos showed him a New York Bulletin article about his recent work at Rand Enterprises on his phone. Suddenly Rand dropped and then stamped on Davos' phone much to his friend's complete dismay.

Rand explaining on the Hand was involved
Rand explained seeing tracking equipment in Bakuto's basement, as Davos pointed that as another reason to leave New York City. Rand is unwilling to leave, to which his friend reminded him that the path won't be open forever and if they miss their opening it will be years before they can return home. Rand told Davos that the Hand caused the Plane Crash which had killed his parents and were responsible for everything. Davos maintained that Rand was the Iron Fist and his duties were to K'un-Lun. Rand reasoned that his duty as the Iron Fist was to destroy the Hand and they were within New York.

Rand replied to Davos on why he left K'un-Lun
He told Davos that just like him, he was trained to be the Iron Fist; however, Davos noted that he was not chosen to undertake the Trial of Shou-Lao and Rand had instead taken the power of the Iron Fist and ran away with it, which Rand insisted was not the whole story. Davos asked what was worth abandoning them, as Rand replied that he got the truth about the deaths of his mother and father. Rand then asked for Davos' help in destroying the Hand as they finally come to an agreement, the moment they had destroyed the Hand once and for all, they would then finally return back to K'un-Lun.

Medical Assistance
Rand and Davos go to Claire Temple for help
Seeking medical attention for his still bleeding wound, Rand had then travelled across New York City until he arrived at Claire Temple's residence to get some help. Temple explained that she had been looking all over the city for him, ever since Rand had been taken from Chikara Dojo, before Temple then asked who Davos was, as Rand explained that he was his friend. Davos then questioned if Temple was a healer before they revealed Rand's bleeding wound, as Temple had immediately got Rand inside.

Rand's injury is stitched up by Claire Temple
While Rand lay shirtless on the table, Temple successfully found and removed a shard of the dagger which had been left behind by Bakuto when he had stabbed Rand. Temple suggested that Rand should use his Chi to heal himself, much to Davos' shock at Temple knowing all about the Iron Fist. However, Rand had revealed that he was unable to summon the fist at the current time. As Temple then helped stitch Rand's wound by painfully using a staple gun, she had asked several questions as Rand explained that Davos was also from K'un-Lun and noted that Bakuto was responsible for the bleeding wound.

Rand informs Claire Temple about the Hand
When Temple then asked about Colleen Wing and what happened to her, Rand had told Davos to go and check the perimeters despite his friend's reluctance to leave Rand. Once he was away, Rand informed Temple that Wing was part of the Hand much to her disbelief and shock, as she noted how Wing previously helped them to fight and capture Madame Gao, although Rand noted that Bakuto and Gao seemed to hate each other. Rand explained the division in the Hand's structure and Bakuto was building an army of soldiers in New York while Temple tried to reason that she may be brainwashed.

Rand is told to calm down by Claire Temple
In a fit of rage, Rand uttered that all this time Wing lied and used him until Temple managed to sternly compel Rand to calm down. Temple asked what happened, Rand dismissed and simply said he was fine while Temple told Rand that the reason for his trouble and emotions might as well be from a broken heart. Finished with cleaning Rand's wounds, Temple urged Rand to get antibiotics and gave Rand a shirt from Luke Cage. Noticing all the bullet holes which had covered the shirt, Rand had then worriedly asked if her friend was okay, Temple smiled and replied that he was probably better than Rand.

Colleen Wing's Explanation
Rand attempts to meditate on the rooftop
Seeking to try and recharge all his Chi, Rand then went out onto the roof of Claire Temple's building as he performed several moves that he had been taught by the Order of the Crane Mother. However, Rand had still found himself with considerable pain due to the wound inflicted by Bakuto, as well as still feeling conflicted emotions as well as memories and pain, thinking back to guarding the pass of K'un-Lun alongside Davos when he had first become the Iron Fist, as these memories had only caused Rand considerably more emotional stress as he could not meditate.

Rand notices Colleen Wing on the rooftop
As Rand struggled to meditate, he was visited by Colleen Wing, as Rand cautiously asked if Bakuto was with her, to which Wing said she was alone. As she tried to approach, Rand stepped away from her, noting that Temple stitched up his wound, but Wing noted that he did not look fine, urging Rand to go to Metro-General Hospital. Rand reminded her that her sensei stabbed him as Wing said that Bakuto told her that he attacked them first while Rand countered that was not what happened as he warned Wing that Bakuto was not a good person and he was building the Hand a new army.

Rand declares he is the enemy of the Hand
Wing reasoned that Bakuto was helping and empowering the kids to make them better like Kevin Michener as well as Becca Yoo. Rand asked why Wing was even there as she answered she cared about him and she wanted to make things right. Unable to trust her, Rand asked if Bakuto told her to say that. When she could not find an easy answer, Rand took a breath as he declared that he was the Iron Fist and Sworn enemy of the Hand. Rand went back to his meditation. Before leaving, Wing sorrowfully apologized for what happened, an apology that Rand silently acknowledged when she left.

Rand suggested to go to his Penthouse
Rand had then rejoined Davos and Temple, who were enjoying pizza together. Knowing that Harold Meachum was the only one who can help them fight against Bakuto, Rand suggested that they should go over to his Penthouse, although Temple had cautioned Rand not to charge in blindly, although Rand told Temple that he only want to see the Hand destroyed. Temple asked Davos to let them speak privately and, once they were alone, Temple then expressed her worry about Rand's state of mind following everything that had happened. Rand, however, had reassured her that he finally knew true purpose.

Rand thanking Claire Temple for her help
Temple then explained that she believed that Rand was more than a destroyer as she told Rand that while she did not know why he left K'un-Lun, whatever he was looking for would not be back there. She further reasoned that his Traumatic Experience as a ten year old was the cause of all of his rage and emotions, warning if he did not get it under control, then destroying would be the only thing that he would be capable of. After taking a short moment to consider all Temple's words, Rand thanked her for her help. He then asked for one more favor, which is to borrow her car, a favor that Temple agreed.

Retaliation against Bakuto
Rand and Davos meet with the Meachums
Returning to Harold Meachum's Penthouse, Rand was first greeted by Harold with a hug before Rand turned to Joy Meachum, who was not too pleased for having been kept out of loop about her father's resurrection; however, Harold defended Rand, saying that he simply followed his wishes. When Harold had then asked about him, Rand had introduced the Meachums to Davos, explaining that Davos was another warrior who was originally from K'un-Lun who was willing and ready to fight alongside them, much to Harold's delight.

Rand discusses how to take on Bakuto
They began discussing how to take on Bakuto, as Rand noted that his Hand Compound was like a fortress, with Davos noting that there were too many guards for them to go in alone, to which Harold then devised a plan to draw Bakuto out. Since Bakuto was draining the money from Madame Gao's Heroin deals back into his accounts and since the Meachums had regained control of Rand Enterprises, they could close the transfer and use that to lure Bakuto out of hiding, as Harold claimed that the Hand were nothing more than mere criminals seeking financial gain and therefore would be easier to predict.

Rand admits that he is willed to stop Bakuto
Harold suggested Rand and Davos would stay near the compound and strike when Bakuto left to take back his money. Davos, however, had remained concerned that Bakuto was still a skilled warrior to take on by themselves, although Harold had insisted that Bakuto would be no match for the Order of the Crane Mother's most skilled warriors, including the Iron Fist. Joy meanwhile was disturbed by Rand's willingness to use lethal force on Bakuto, having assumed that they would simply capture him and hand him over to the New York City Police Department to face his justice within jail.

Rand explains to Davos why he left K'un-Lun
At night, Rand and Davos waited outside Bakuto's compound, while bickering about who could drive Claire Temple's car, as Davos then reminded Rand of when Rand wrecked Brother Kuo's cart when they went to watch girls bathing only for them to find Lei Kung meditating naked. Rand told Davos about how he got flashes of anger which made his Chi harder to control making him question his right for the Iron Fist, as Davos said he should have followed Kung's teaching as none of the recent events would have happened if Rand had simply remained stationed at K'un-Lun as was the duty of the Iron Fist.

Rand confesses that he needed to leave
Davos confessed that he struggled with his anger, admitting that he thought the Trial of Shou-Lao was his birthright. Davos questioned Rand over leaving K'un-Lun for New York City, questioning why he would abandon his friends and family. Rand could only explain that ever since his Plane Crash he had felt an emptiness that not even the Iron Fist could fix, explaining how while looking for a sign for what to do, he saw a hawk flying which allowed him to know that the way out of K'un-Lun was open, although Davos argued that it was a sign that the way was open and K'un-Lun had now needed protection.

Rand stops Colleen Wing from her attack
As Davos had questioned what was keeping Rand in New York, they had then spotted Colleen Wing just as she was making her escape from the Hand Compound. Upon seeing this, Rand then followed her much to Davos' protest. Rand had worriedly approached Wing who, having been traumatized following being betrayed by Bakuto and being forced to fight her former students, her faith in the Hand was shaken and destroyed, Wing grabbed a metal pipe and swung it at Rand. Having calmed down since their last encounter, Rand told the clearly terrified Wing that he was not trying to do her harm.

Rand forgives Colleen Wing for her actions
In her suicidal state of mind, Wing tried to provoke Rand to kill her but Rand managed to grab the metal pipe and held Wing as he then pleaded for Wing to calm down. She bemoaned that everything she believed in the Hand was false as Rand comforted Wing, noting how he had understood how it felt to have everything one believed in only to be pulled away as Rand told Wing that they had to stop running and destroy everything. Finally forgiving her, Rand pulled Wing into a hug and consoled her. Meanwhile, Davos watched them from behind, disappointed and highly concerned about Rand's decision.

Tension between Brothers
Rand comforts Colleen Wing after her trauma
Making their way back towards New York City, Rand had then calmly comforted Colleen Wing who was still shaken by the knowledge that her own beloved Sensei, Bakuto, had tried to kill her. However, they were interrupted when Davos warned Rand not to believe Wing since she was a part of the Hand, although Wing stated that she was not. Rand urged Davos to relax but, still mistrusting Wing's intentions, Davos refused to believe anything Wing said, becoming angered when Wing recognized him as being from K'un-Lun as Davos realized that Rand had told her about him.

Rand defends Colleen Wing from Davos
Rand defended Wing, reminding Davos that she helped them escape the Hand Compound; however, Davos believed that she simply faked defection to spy on them. Rand maintained that Wing was on their side, so Davos then suggested that Wing could help them blow up the compound with Bakuto and his soldiers inside it, but Wing refused, stating that her students from Chikara Dojo were all still in there. When Davos taunted that he brutally defeated her students during their escape, Wing punched him as Rand quickly intervened to then keep the fight from escalating as the tensions rose.

Rand insist on being rational than Davos
Davos took that as proof that Wing was still with the Hand as Wing made her disapproval of Davos known. Rand pleaded both of his friends to calm down as Davos insisted that he was the only rational one. He reminded Rand that as Iron Fist, it was his duty to destroy the Hand. Davos then taunted and asked when Rand had become a coward but Rand ignored him and tried to reason with Wing that he was simply taught in one way by the Order of the Crane Mother back at K'un-Lun. His friend countered that the place confused Rand and ruined his Chi and with that said, the trio had tensely continued.

Rand praises Colleen Wing for her bravery
They finally regrouped at Chikara Dojo where Rand cleaned Wing's bruises in her room while he had praised her for being brave during the Escape from the Hand Compound while Wing stressed that she was foolish as everything Bakuto told her was a lie and she believed him, although Rand told Wing that Bakuto was a piece of garbage while she was still human. Rand then told Wing he would use his own influence at Rand Enterprises to arrange a hotel for her, so she can be safe from another attack by the Hand; however, Wing refused and said that she would not hide as she wanted Bakuto dead.

Rand gets a video-message from Bakuto
Davos entered the room and noted that they were losing their focus, just when Ward Meachum video-called Rand. Answering the call, Rand discovered to his great horror that Bakuto was calling him as he showed the Meachums taken hostage as Bakuto told Rand that he left him a few options and that he should take it as a compliment as it showed how much the Iron Fist meant to him. Without another word, Bakuto shot Joy Meachum into the stomach, much to Rand's horror as Bakuto told Rand that if he did not come in thirty minutes, Joy would bleed out and Harold Meachum would get beheaded.

Rand tells Davos that he must stop Bakuto
As Bakuto drew his Katana and held it to Harold's neck, Bakuto then warned that he would soon lose another family if he did not obey him, while Ward Meachum cared for his sister's gunshot wound. Left with no other option, Rand prepared to go to the Penthouse to the Meachum's rescue; however, Davos suggested that they should wait for Bakuto to leave the building and take him down. Rand told Davos that he would not lose his family to the Hand again as Rand furiously told Davos that as the Iron Fist, he did not have to listen to whatever Davos had said to him, as Rand had then stormed outside.

Fighting Bakuto
Rand demands Bakuto let Joy Meachum go
Making his way across New York City as fast as he could, Rand just reached the Penthouse in time to prevent Bakuto decapitating Harold Meachum in front of his children. As Bakuto joked that Rand had cut it a little close, Rand demanded that the Meachums be let go, while walking past the bodies of Kevin Singleton and Gary who had been gunned down by Bakuto's men. Taking Joy Meachum's hand, Rand insisted that she needed a doctor, as Bakuto promised she would get medical attention once they had left the building.

Rand surrendering himself over to Bakuto
After exchanging a few words with Joy, Bakuto's men put Rand into handcuffs despite Rand insisting that he was surrendering under his own free will as Bakuto noted that with or without the Iron Fist, Rand was still a dangerous enemy who needed to be controlled. Rand then learned that Ward Meachum was the one who called Bakuto there as Bakuto apologised that he would not live up to his end of the deal in which Ward had attempted to have his father killed, as Rand looked at Ward in disgust while Ward could only remorsefully apologize onto Rand while Bakuto and his men left with the captured Rand.          

Rand questions Bakuto's true plans for him
In the elevator, Bakuto called the Meachums a pit of vipers and that Rand should be thankful that he helped Rand get away from them. Rand asked Bakuto what he was planning to do with the Iron Fist as Bakuto simply smiled and said that someone in the Organization had wanted work with Rand while Bakuto also said that they were going to change the world. Bakuto vowed he would keep the promise he made back at the Hand Compound to complete Rand's training as the Iron Fist, although Rand had replied that he did not even what he wanted to be himself and questioned how Bakuto would help. 

Iron Fist breaking free from his handcuffs
As they reached the bottom floor, Rand calmed himself and slowly regained a semblance of his Chi without Bakuto or any of the other guards noticing. Having calmed his mind, Rand had then succeeded in summoning the Iron Fist and Broke his Chains with a single strong movement. Wishing to take advantage of the element of surprise, Rand attempted to strike at Bakuto but quickly lost his powers again. While Bakuto and all of his men were distracted by Rand's sudden escape, Colleen Wing and Davos had then sprung out from their own hiding places and had then furiously attacked Bakuto's soldiers.

Rand faces Bakuto head on in a duel
Iron Fist quickly dispatched one guard before he faced Bakuto while Iron Fist had taunted that he had gotten the feeling that Bakuto was not actually allowed to kill him. However, Bakuto had simply drawn his own Katana and answered that he was allowed to subdue him by means necessary. Bakuto immediately managed to slash at the Iron Fist's chest, cutting him as Bakuto noted that the Hand had some of the best doctors in the world who could put him back together. Iron Fist and Bakuto entered into their fierce struggle as Bakuto prepared and more aggressive this time, keeping the Iron Fist on the edge.

Rand trying to get the upper hand on Bakuto
As Bakuto furiously swung his Katana at Iron Fist, he attempted to land a deadly blow, only for Iron Fist to catch the blade with his bare hands and keep Bakuto at bay while Wing and Davos continued their own brutal duels. As they became distracted by Wing screaming in pain at being cut by her own Katana, Rand pushed Bakuto away as they continued their fight. When all his guards were defeated by the combined forces of Wing and Davos, Bakuto was forced to make a run for it out of the Building with Iron Fist chasing after him, followed by Wing and Davos who would not allow him to escape.

Rand and Davos watching Bakuto's final duel
They followed Bakuto through New York City until Bakuto eventually reached Central Park and stopped to face them. He berated Wing for betraying the Hand as he stated that he should have recognized that she was too weak for the Hand as he called her nothing more than a teacher of children at Chikara Dojo. Wing told them that she would take him on alone as Rand was forced to watch as Wing duel against her former master, fearing for Wing's safety against the formidable Bakuto. Following their Intense Duel, Wing emerged as the victor as she had finally stabbed Bakuto straight through the stomach.

Rand tells Davos that he should not kill
Davos urged for Bakuto to be killed, reminding him of his duty as the Iron Fist by the Order of the Crane Mother; however, Wing stated that they should instead hand Bakuto over onto the New York City Police Department. While bleeding out, Bakuto then taunted Rand, asking if this was what his father's intentions were when he had raised him as Danny Rand, as Bakuto said that if he killed him, then Rand will only be another one in a long line of the Immortal Weapons to be used by others. Furious by Rand's inaction and indecision, Davos murdered Bakuto himself by plunging his dagger into Bakuto's heart.

Fight Between Brothers
Rand is insulted by Davos's remark on him
In horror, Rand had then admonished Davos for his action in having just murdered Bakuto, as Davos strongly reminded Rand that he was the Iron Fist and his duty was to kill the Hand while Rand argued that the rules were different in New York City as there were consequences for killing but Davos still disagreed and stated that Rand simply could not commit the act as he was not a warrior and further denounced him as a failure. Colleen Wing had defended Rand, to which Davos loudly told her that due to her past actions she had no say in this while Rand had still stood by Wing.

Rand demanded Davos to yield from their fight
Aggravated, Davos told Rand that K'un-Lun would have been better off if neither Chodak nor Tashi had not saved him from the wreckage of his Plane Crash. Enraged, Rand had charged at Davos as the two former friends furiously began to fight each other. While they fought, Davos still castigated Rand's decision to stay in New York over the people who raised him while Rand countered this had nothing to do with K'un-Lun, he stated that Davos was angry because Rand left him. They continued their fight and Rand managed to force Davos to the ground, demanding that Davos yield and offered a hand.

Rand declaring to be the Iron Fist
Full of resentment and rage, Davos refused and attacked him again but Rand had quickly forced Davos to the ground again and held him down. Angered, Rand used his Chi and summoned the Iron Fist once again, demanding Davos to yield. Rand admitted and acknowledged that he hurt Davos and it was selfish to leave without telling him, but Rand further explained that ever since he returned to New York, he had learned that his powers were not just meant for K'un-Lun. While the others before him were content with being guardians, he declared that he was of both worlds, as Danny Rand and Iron Fist.

Rand apologizes to Davos following their fight
Dismayed for what he almost did, Rand apologized to his friend while Davos got back onto his feet and stepped away from him. Rand then pleaded for Davos to understand his reasoning; however, Davos sadly replied that he would never understand why he would ever choose to abandon the Order of the Crane Mother to return to the United States of America, noting that all that he had understood now was that now K'un-Lun's passage was opened and that Rand was putting them all in danger by leaving it unguarded. Before leaving, Davos warned his former brother that there would soon be consequences.

Rand realizes that Bakuto had disappeared
While Davos had walked away from Central Park and left them alone, Wing had then asked if Rand was okay, to which he replied that he would get through it. When they turned to look at Bakuto, they found to their complete shock that his corpse was gone. They deduced that Bakuto's men must have taken him as they would not want anyone getting ahold of the corpse of a Hand leader. Although they affirmed that Bakuto died when Davos stabbed him through the heart, they remained worried as Rand noted Harold Meachum had managed to return from the dead as well with the assistance of the Hand.

Meachum's Betrayal
Calm Before the Storm
Rand calls Harold Meachum about Joy
Driving Colleen Wing back towards the Chikara Dojo, Rand had then called up Harold Meachum to update him on the situation and to also inform him about the death of Bakuto which had relived Harold. After learning about Joy Meachum's current condition following her being shot by Bakuto in the stomach, Rand asked which hospital they were at by Harold insisted that he instead get some rest. As they ended their conversation, Rand had told Harold that he would be staying with Wing at the Dojo for the time being, as Harold then thanked him for finally setting him free.

Rand speaks on behalf of his fight with Davos
They started walking back to the dojo. Rand informed Wing that he had no idea that his Chi powers would work again when Bakuto had handcuffed him, as Wing asked if this meant that Rand is recovering but he said not to get too excited about it. Taking a moment to talk, Rand told Wing about his misgivings with his fight with Davos as he had greatly regretted ruining his friendship over their different views on the Iron Fist's responsibilities. Rand admitted that he did not want his relationship with Wing also breaking apart. He told Wing that ever since the Plane Crash, he always felt the need to find a family.

Rand tenderly kisses Colleen Wing
Rand went on to explain hoped that he had hoped to fill the void left by the deaths of his mother and father within the monks who had saved him at K'un-Lun or later on with the Meachums when he had finally returned back to New York City, but he had found that neither of them did and had just left him feeling more confused about his place in life. Rand confessed that what he found in his relationship with Wing filled the emptiness in way that he could only describe as new and different. Wing smiled and admitted her feelings for Rand were mutual as happily, they kissed and retired to the dojo.

Rand and Colleen Wing training side by side
The next morning, Rand turned on some of his music and meditated, practicing his martial arts as he did. Wing eventually woke up and went to join him, as they then stood side by side and practiced their moves. After spending some time meditating together, the music stopped when Rand's phone received a message. When Rand went to check the message, he learned that Ward Meachum texted and warned Rand to immediately get out of the dojo and someone was after him. After quickly asking who, Ward replied and warned that Harold betrayed him and again demanded that Rand escape.

Rand and Colleen Wing escape from the DEA
Immediately heading towards the window to investigate, Rand had then spotted several armed guards entering the dojo. Believing them to be the Hand, Rand and Wing immediately faced them when they broke in, preparing themselves for a fight as they believed they were sent by either Madame Gao or Bakuto. After dispatching them with considerable ease however, they realized that they were DEA, as one of the agents demanded that Rand get down on the ground before he was then knocked unconscious by Rand's kick. Knowing they were now hunted, Rand and Wing had immediately fled the dojo.

Framed and Hunted
Rand and Colleen Wing hiding together
Hiding in Central Park, Rand hid behind a tree as he saw a few New York City Police Department cops passed by. With Rand still highly on edge, he was alerted when Colleen Wing had arrived with the New York Bulletin which had stated that Rand was wanted for drug trafficking and money laundering. Baffled, Rand reasoned that he shut down Madame Gao's operation and got the drugs out of Rand Enterprises; however, Wing had simply stated that it did not change what the news was currently reporting.

Rand plans to find evidence of his innocence
Angered and confused about what was happened, Rand questioned what had made Harold Meachum betray him since he had freed him from the Hand. Wing urged Rand not to overthink, as she noted that this would not help their situation before Rand then asked how Wing was dealing with the situation following everything that happened with Bakuto and their escape from Chikara Dojo. Calming down a bit, Rand planned that they need to find evidence of his innocence and that they need to get in touch with Jeri Hogarth. They enlisted Claire Temple's assistance to help get them in contact with Hogarth.

Rand secretly meeting with Jeri Hogarth
While hiding in a secluded alleyway, Temple had managed to bring Hogarth to Rand and Wing. Hogarth updated Rand on what was happening, advising them not to hand themselves in as it would not end well. She warned Rand and Wing that the DEA considered them both dangerous and thus they would not hesitate to shoot, noting that now Wing was also a target. Hogarth gave Rand documents which Rand recognized them as being from the Hand tablet, except they were changed. Hogarth informed Rand that Harold had made his appearance and was currently based in Rand Enterprises.

Rand deciding to look for Madame Gao
Hogarth noted how early in her career she had learned never to trust Harold, as Rand noted how Ward Meachum had warned him about trusting him. Hogarth then listed the three options that Rand could take, he could return back to K'un-Lun and stay away from New York City, turn himself in but given the evidence against Rand, Hogarth can only help him with a plea deal or Rand could prove his innocence as the documents are digital and they could have been easily copied somewhere. Knowing that he had no other option except one, Rand decided to look for the one person he trusted less than Harold.

The Hard Truth
Rand heads back to the Hand Compound
Rand and Colleen Wing headed back to the Hand Compound. While they ventured deeper inside, they found the place deserted, as Wing noted that there were at least fifty teenagers who had lived there, so it should not be as silent as it currently was. Rand questioned if, as they had killed Bakuto during the Duel at Bethesda Terrace, maybe the students had abandoned the Compound, although Wing noted that they would soon find out, while commenting on how little she understood while they made their way through the Compound.

Rand greeting Madame Gao in her cell
They eventually reached Madame Gao's cell, finding her still in her room seemingly abandoned by Bakuto's men without food or water, although Gao noted that she had survived worse. Rand noted that Gao could easily used her Chi to have escaped from her own room; however, Gao had simply laughed and stated that she wouldn't miss Rand's visit, having foreseen that he would return. Rand asked for access to her files, Gao replied that she had purged all information from her computer. Wing stated that she was lying only for the old woman to insist that she never lied to Rand, unlike Wing.

Rand listens to Madame Gao about the truth
They then entered Gao's cell as Rand demanded she tell him what he needed to know, but Gao had still ridiculed Rand for being a poor Iron Fist as he did not understand his own path and his chi was so polluted with guilt. Rand asked what he should feel guilty of as Gao answered the Death of his Parents. Gao quietly stated that Rand  must have wondered why he had survived, noting the reason that Rand left K'un-Lun was his guilt with anger and rage. Rand insisted that he had not been seeking revenge, although Gao noted that even when young, Rand knew something had caused the crash.

Rand has a conversation with Madame Gao
Rand questioned why, if what she was saying was the truth, why he had not killed Gao already, to which Gao laughed and said that he knew deep down that she did not kill his parents. Gao explained that it was someone far more treacherous, claiming that she tried to talk him out of it. Wing warned Rand that Gao was playing mind games and tried to get him on her side but Gao claimed that she was trying to get him on the side of truth and honesty. When Rand asked who would want to kill his parents, Gao told Rand to stop thinking like a child and consider who would benefit from his family's death.

Rand enduring the lies of Harold Meachum
Rand noted that Harold Meachum was his father's best friend and would not have him killed, Gao sharply reminded Rand that Harold had no trouble hurting him now. Forced to acknowledge the truth of Gao's word, Rand listened as Gao explained that Harold accepted his resurrection and that he set up their heroin deals in China. She further explained that Wendell was close to discovering Harold's new dealings, so he asked Gao for the poison. Gao had then claimed that Rand would only achieve the true strength of the Iron Fist if he killed Harold as Wing took Rand away and led him out of Gao's cell.

Turmoil from Betrayals
Rand considering Harold Meachum's betrayal
Regrouping again with Claire Temple, Rand was still reeling from the knowledge that Harold Meachum had lied to him all this time. Feeling utterly betrayed by the man he considered a friend and father figure, Rand made his opinion about vengeance known to his companions while Colleen Wing had pledged that she will help him and Temple stated that all they needed was to get the Hand tablet to prove his innocence. Rand had then told his friends about how he used to believe his mother was still alive and she was waiting for Rand to find her. The thought filled Rand with guilt.

Rand listens to Claire Temple's thoughts
Temple tried to comfort Rand. She told him about her other friends who had special abilities like him like Daredevil and Luke Cage, as Temple noted that when she first met him, she noticed that Rand had the sweet innocence to him compared to her friends who were dark and haunted people. Temple told Rand that the more he kept fighting the anguish of his past, the more Rand would end up just like them. Temple told Rand that he knew that he was not given his powers just to be a murderer as she further told Rand that killing Meachum would still not make him feel any better about his parent's deaths.
