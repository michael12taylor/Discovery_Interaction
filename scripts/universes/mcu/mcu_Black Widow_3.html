<html><p>As the battle wound down, Black Widow and Hawkeye turned their attention to evacuating the civilian populace, but soon she received the call to calm Hulk back to his human state. However, the process was interrupted by Ultron, who raked Hulk with gunfire whilst at the controls of the Avengers' own Quinjet and knocked Black Widow out.

Black Widow is saved by Hulk

Hulk grabbed Black Widow and bore her to safety on a newly arrived Helicarrier, before leaping after Ultron to vent his rage. Black Widow soon learned that Hulk had beaten Ultron in the departing Quinjet and appealed to him through a video link to disengage the plane's stealth technology, stating that it was harder for the Avengers to track him down, but Hulk simply severed the connection.
New Avengers
The New Team
Romanoff and Nick Fury discuss Bruce Banner
With the Ultron Offensive neutralized, Romanoff returned to the New Avengers Facility with the rest of her teammates. Since her plan to run away with Banner had failed, due to him missing in action, she had nothing else but to remain a superhero.

Romanoff trains the new lineup of Avengers
After being sent a Skype video of the newly-born Nathaniel Pietro Barton, Romanoff joined Captain America in co-leading the second incarnation of the Avengers, featuring Scarlet Witch, War Machine, Vision and Falcon. When an intruder breached the facility, Falcon engaged him in a fight, but ultimately lost. Upon his defeat, Falcon told Romanoff through the commlink it was important to him that Captain America never found about his failure.

Attack of Ultimo
HYDRA collected many of the parts of the destroyed Ultron Sentries and took them to an undisclosed location in Eastern Europe, where they used the parts to create the Ultimo and then used it to attack a small village. Romanoff joined the Avengers to an attack on the giant robot and together, they managed to destroy Ultimo.

Attack on the IFID Headquarters
Black Widow in Lagos
In 2016, Black Widow was on a mission in Lagos with Captain America, Scarlet Witch, and Falcon, where they were waiting to ambush Crossbones. Black Widow was sitting at a caf√® with Scarlet Witch, observing the area. When Redwing scanned a garbage truck, it was revealed to be at maximum capacity; Black Widow realized that the truck was a battering ram. The team then moved out to the IFID Headquarters where the truck had gone to. Crossbones, having retrieved the biological weapon, escaped the building with his henchmen.

Black Widow fails to defeat Crossbones
Black Widow gave chase on a motorcycle. She defeated Crossbones' agents with relative ease but was grabbed by Crossbones himself, her Bite ineffective against his armored suit. Crossbones, claiming that his allegiance was no longer to HYDRA, threw Black Widow into a truck containing two of his agents, tossing a grenade inside and closing the roof. Black Widow incapacitated the agents and escaped the truck when the grenade blew.

Black Widow tries to retrieve the chemical
Crossbones gave the chemical his agents, ordering them to split up. This prompted the Avengers to chase them around Lagos. While Captain America fought Crossbones, Black Widow and Falcon pursued his agents. Black Widow reached them and held them at gunpoint; however, one threatened to drop the chemical. Black Widow killed one of them and the Redwing drone killed the other. Black Widow caught the vial before it hit the ground, thanking Falcon as she left the area. Though Falcon insisted that she thank the drone, Black Widow refused. The battle ended with a blast accidentally caused by Scarlet Witch, which killed several civilians. Black Widow was quick to comfort her afterwards.

Avengers Civil War
Sokovia Accords
The Avengers meet with Thaddeus Ross
In the wake of their mission in Lagos, the Avengers were presented summoned to a meeting by Thaddeus Ross, who proposed the Sokovia Accords, which would put them under the direct command of a panel of the United Nations. Ross explained that while there were many who were grateful for the heroic actions of the Avengers, some deemed the members of the organization dangerous and believed the Accords would establish sanctions and oversight of the group.

The Avengers fight over the Sokovia Accords
Ross proceeded with video footages of the Battle of New York, Battle at the Triskelion, Battle of Sokovia, and the Attack on the IFID Headquarters, as well as the serious amount of destruction and chaos induced by individuals such as Loki, Ultron, the terrorist organization HYDRA, and the former HYDRA agent Crossbones to show them why many individuals around the world deem the Avengers as vigilantes.

Romanoff debates the Sokovia Accords
After the meeting concluded with Ross, the Avengers reunited at the New Avengers Facility where Tony Stark discussed his position on the Sokovia Accords. Much to the shock of her comrades, Romanoff agreed with Tony Stark and was willing to agree to the terms of the Accords, as she firmly believed that the Avengers as a group made mistakes in the past that they need to amend. She then called Clint Barton and asked if he would sign the Accords, but he claimed he had retired rather than sign.

Peggy Carter's Funeral
Romanoff comforts Rogers
On her way to Vienna, where the Accords would be amended, she stopped at Saint Luke's Cathedral, where Steve Rogers had attended the funeral of Peggy Carter. After everyone else left, Rogers stayed behind alone in the church. Romanoff approached him and listened as Steve claimed how he initially assumed that everyone he knew was deceased after he awoke from the ice, but later found that Peggy was still alive.

Romanoff informs Rogers about the status of the Sokovia Accords
Romanoff condoled him and said that Carter had his back. He asked her who else had signed the Accords, so she replied that Stark, James Rhodes and Vision had all signed. She asked Rogers if he would reconsider his decision to not sign the Accords, saying that the Avengers should stay together regardless of how. He, as she expected, still refused and she admitted she was there as a friend to support him as he mourned the loss of Carter.

Vienna Conference
Romanoff meets Prince T'Challa
In the conference at Vienna, Romanoff met T'Challa, who thanked her for supporting the Sokovia Accords. She also met his father, T'Chaka; to him, she gave her condolences for the death of the Wakandan citizens in Lagos. During the conference, a bomb was activated, killing T'Chaka. The authorities suspected that Bucky Barnes was responsible for the bombing from security tapes showing the man responsible.

Romanoff speaks with Steve Rogers
Outside the building, Romanoff apologized for T'Challa's loss and promised him that the task force would catch Barnes, but T'Challa said that he would kill Barnes himself. Steve Rogers called her and asked if she was fine and Romanoff responded positively, asking Rogers to stay out of the case with Barnes, or he might make things worse. However, Rogers insisted that he should be the one who to bring Barnes in since he would not die by trying it. He hung up the phone, and Romanoff knew he went to defend Barnes.

Winter Soldier's Escape
Romanoff in the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre
Steve Rogers, Sam Wilson, T'Challa and Bucky Barnes were captured by the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre, and were brought to the agency headquarter in Berlin. There, Romanoff told Rogers that what he had done had made things worse. In a meeting hall, Romanoff, Rogers, Wilson, Stark, and Sharon Carter watched Bucky's interrogation by Theo Broussard. However, Rogers began to suspect the psychiatrist was involved somehow with the setup of Barnes.

Romanoff is strangled by the Winter Soldier
During Barnes' psychological assessment, a power failure occurred. Barnes freed himself and tried to escape; however, Romanoff, Tony Stark and Sharon Carter engaged him. After which Stark and Carter were subdued by the Winter Soldier, Romanoff engaged him personally. Romanoff was strangled by Barnes. As he attempted to finally kill his enemy once and for all, Romanoff asked if he could at least recognize her from their last encounter during the Battle of Washington, D.C. until T'Challa saved her in the nick of time.

Romanoff recruits T'Challa
However, Barnes escaped, but she and Stark knew Barnes was most likely with Rogers, who, along with Wilson, had also escaped custody. Thaddeus Ross gave Stark thirty-six hours to bring them in. Stark asked Romanoff if Hulk could assist them, but Romanoff knew that even if he was here, he would probably not be on their side. To get the fugitives in time, Romanoff approached T'Challa to ask for his help, promising she would help him find Barnes, despite engaging in a brief confrontation with Ayo, who initially demanded her to move away from T'Challa, but was dismissed by her King, who explained that Romanoff was an ally.

Clash of the Avengers
Black Widow confronts Captain America
With a team assembled, Black Widow joined Iron Man's team as they arrived at and evacuated the Leipzig-Halle Airport. When Captain America headed for a helicopter, he was stopped by Iron Man, and then surrounded by his team. Black Widow approached and asked Captain America to think about what was going to happen, and if he wanted it to turn into violence, rather than surrendering. However, Captain America's team then ambushed them, and they began to clash.

Black Widow fighting against Ant-Man
Black Widow found herself fighting against Ant-Man, who was hesitant to hurt her, which she assured him not to stress about as he didn't stand a chance against her. Black Widow then attacked Ant-Man and gained the upper hand in their fight; however, he suddenly shrunk down and threw her to the ground and began to pin her arm. As a response, she used her bite to knock him away, freeing herself.

Black Widow during the Clash of the Avengers

Joining War Machine and Black Panther who were fighting Captain America, Ant-Man returned, who enlarged a truck that Captain America threw, with a Pym Particles Disks, towards the three, causing an explosion. Black Widow was able to evade the explosion but was still knocked to the ground. Becoming frustrated by their opponents' refusal to surrender, Black Widow checked back with Iron Man to ask if this was all a part of the plan, for which he claimed they were only going easy on them, causing them to now going to change up their approach to be more aggressive.
Fighting Former Comrades
Black Widow alongside Iron Man's team
When Captain America's team were stopped by Vision, the rest of Iron Man's team regrouped, Black Widow being carried in by Iron Man. The two teams then stood before each other, and when the opposing team began to approach, Black Widow sarcastically and exhaustedly stated that it was going to end well.

Black Widow fights against Ant-Man again
They then followed in moving forward so that they were both then charging at each other at full force. As the two sides collided together, a battle erupted with Tony's team fighting Steve's team to prevent them from escaping to Siberia. When they collided, Black Widow found herself fighting Ant-Man again, dodging his attacks and kicking him when he returned to regular size, thus defeating him. She then threw his whole body to the ground, concluding their fight.

Black Widow being confined by Hawkeye
Black Widow then moved on and came into contact with Hawkeye, and engaged in a fierce fight with him. The two used their combat skills and weapons to fight each other until Hawkeye threw her to the ground. He then pinned her on the ground, and the fight was paused when she asked whether they were still best friends despite the current conflict, which he jokingly assured depending on how hard she hit him. 

Black Widow is thrown back by Wanda Maximoff
At that moment, Black Widow then got the upper hand, wrapping her legs around Hawkeye and threw him aside, due to him holding back. When she then went to kick him in the face to finish him, she was suddenly immobilized by Wanda Maximoff, saving Hawkeye. Unable to fend off Maximoff's abilities, Black Widow was then launched into a luggage vehicle and was knocked out. After coming to, Black Widow climbed on top of a jet bridge, where she witnessed the fight continue, to her displeasure.

Black Widow witnesses the fight continue
No longer wanting to participate in the fight with those she cared about, she made her way to the hangar to guard the Quinjet, as it was the only way of escape. Eventually, Captain America and Bucky Barnes made it to the hangar, where they were stopped by Black Widow. Knowing Captain America, she knew that he would never surrender and that there was no point in fighting them, so she decided to let them go.

Black Widow chooses to switch allegiances
However, Black Panther then appeared behind them and was about to apprehend them, when she used her Bite to hold him back, tasering him. Captain America and Barnes then made their way onboard the Quinjet, as Black Widow continued to stall Black Panther, hitting him with her taser disks whenever he broke free of them. However, he was able to get past her, but it was too late, as they had escaped in the Quinjet, leaving the airport. She told Black Panther that she would help him find them, not capture them, seeing a difference in that.

After the Clash
Romanoff after betraying her team in the fight
Moments before the end of the fight at the airport, James Rhodes crashed on the ground due to Vision's misfire. They all headed to Columbia University Medical Center, where Rhodes was treated, and Romanoff met up with Tony Stark, and the two went to talk privately.

Romanoff is updated on James Rhodes
Stark informed her of Rhodes' current state, which she then addressed how Steve Rogers wasn't going to stop, meaning what happened to Rhodes was a best-case scenario. However, Stark called Romanoff out for letting Rogers and Bucky Barnes go, which she defends her actions by saying that they went about the whole incident the wrong way. Stark insults Romanoff by calling upon her former days of being a double agent. Romanoff then called Stark out for letting his ego cloud him.

Romanoff confronts Tony Stark about how he acted
Stark then told her that T'Challa had told Thaddeus Ross of her betrayal, giving her a halfhearted warning that the government would come to arrest her, while saying that double crossing people is one of the things she's good at. However, Romanoff stated that she wasn't the one that needed to watch her back, but rather Stark, due to the loss of allies he created due to how he had chosen to act during the whole incident, not trying to keep his friends together. Romanoff then left Stark and went on the run.

Confronting Her Past
Escaping from Thaddeus Ross
Romanoff evades Thaddeus Ross
Romanoff left the United States of America and fled to Norway. In Norway, she watched phone security footage of Thaddeus Ross and his S.W.A.T. team entering a train station in Albany where she had left her suit and tracker in, and then called Ross to speak with him directly. Romanoff told Ross that he was embarrassing himself trying to capture her, before hanging up and taking a ferry to her hiding place.

Romanoff is assisted by Rick Mason
After collecting some supplies, Romanoff drove up to her safehouse, where she was reunited with her old friend Rick Mason, who had set her up in her new location and brought a set of new identifications for her under the name "Fanny Longbottom." Before Mason left, Romanoff asked about a box full of mail, which he explained was from her Budapest safehouse, as he had someone else occupying that place.

Ambushed by Taskmaster
Romanoff fires upon Taskmaster
That night, Romanoff put the box in her car, and settled in watching Moonraker, as well as considering dying her hair blonde. When the generator ran out of fuel, Romanoff decided to drive out and get more, but was hit with an explosive, causing her to nearly fall off the bridge. Noticing Taskmaster approaching her, who Romanoff assumed was sent by Thaddeus Ross, she opened fire upon her assailant, only to be counter attacked with a shield being thrown at her.

Romanoff fights against Taskmaster
Romanoff got out of the car, and was continued to fire upon Taskmaster, before being soon disarmed, turning the fight into a hand-to-hand. Romanoff preformed her signature scissor leg takedown, to no effect, only for Taskmaster to copy the exact same move, knocking her down. Confused by Taskmaster's perfect mimicry of her move, Romanoff got back up in her pose, which was simultaneously copied by Taskmaster, adding to Romanoff's puzzlement. Realizing Taskmaster wasn't after her, Romanoff grabbed the contents of the case that was in her car, but was kicked off the bridge, and fell into the river, allowing her to escape. Romanoff inspected the vials of Red Dust, which had an attached picture of her and Yelena Belova, her estranged adoptive sister.

Reuniting with Yelena Belova
Romanoff reunited with Yelena Belova
Arriving in Budapest, Hungary, Romanoff headed to her safehouse, retrieved her stashed gun, and went to stealthily enter the apartment, but Yelena Belova revealed she was aware of her presence. As they talked to each other, Romanoff went inside, searching for Belova, until they were finally reunited, both aiming guns at each other. 

Romanoff fights with Yelena Belova
Having the same training, the sisters were able to disarm and take each other's gun, leading to a fierce and brutal brawl, as they fought throughout the apartment, smashing each other into walls, doors, and cupboards. Belova pulled a knife out to attack Romanoff with, but she was able to knock it out of her hand. When they both began to choke each other with a window curtain, Romanoff saw that Belova would not desist, nor win, so she decided to call a truce, which Belova agreed to, and they stopped fighting.

Romanoff learns the Red Room is still active
Belova enquired about the bullet holes in the wall, which Romanoff replied that they were made by arrows, and then asked about the Red Dust, so Belova explained that it controls minds. Being on the run, Romanoff expressed her disinterest in helping her, but Belova had no one else to come to, and hoped that she would have gotten the Avengers to take down the Red Room. Having thought she killed Dreykov years ago with Clint Barton, Romanoff was shocked and in disbelief to learn that the Red Room was still active. Romanoff detailed the intense mission to kill Dreykov, convinced he was dead, in which Belova brought up his daughter. 

Romanoff being ambushed by the Black Widows
The two were then attacked by the Black Widows, forcing them to escape from the apartment, which was made difficult with assassins at every turn as they tried to reach Belova's motorbike. Reaching the rooftops, they were pursued by a Black Widow, who Romanoff attempted to save when they jumped on a moving pillar, only to drop her when she was attacked. Romanoff also fell, and when she went to check on the Widow, she witnessed her uncontrollably kill herself, to Romanoff's horror.

Romanoff escapes with Yelena Belova
They got to the Belova's motorbike, which Romanoff had stolen the keys for, when an armoured car driven by Taskmaster crashed into the scene and began chasing after them. Another Black Widow on a motorbike came after them and knocked them off their vehicle, so Belova stole a car for them, which Romanoff drove. Unable to get away and coming under heavy fire, Belova decided to deal with the Widow herself, but they were still being chased by Taskmaster. Using an explosive arrow, Taskmaster fired it at the car, sendind it to topple over and crash into a subway station.

Romanoff talks about killing Antonia Dreykov
After getting out of the car, Romanoff told Belova not to bandage her arm so they could trick Taskmaster with a fake trail of her blood, as they snuck into an old hiding spot she and Barton used during their mission. Losing Taskmaster, Romanoff revealed that she spent two days in the ceiling with Barton, and Belova proceeded to explain who Taskmaster was. Belova then brought up how Romanoff killed Dreykov's daughter, so she went into complete detail about how she needed to do it in order to defect into S.H.I.E.L.D..

Romanoff is accused of being a poser
Heading to a store, Romanoff asked more about the Red Room, but Belova didn't know much, due to all the Widows forced into being sedated, and that Dreykov never went after Romanoff because the Avengers would come after him. Romaonff revealed that she believed Belova would have gotten out of the Red Room long ago and not wanted to see her. Belova then asked Romanoff about her tendency to pose during fights, leading them to talk about how they're both killers, but only Romanoff is considered a hero.

Romanoff and Yelena Belova decide to team up
Afterwards, as they shared drinks, Belova told Romanoff more about the Red Dust and her time with the Red Room, being made to kill with no independence. Belova then asked Romanoff several questions, including if she ever searched for her real parents, and whether she ever wanted to have children. With nowhere to go, Romanoff invited Belova to help her kill Dreykov and end the Red Room together. Belova accepted, and they stole another car, where they discussed Belova's vest during the drive.

Rescuing Alexei Shostakov
Romanoff is helped by Rick Mason
Deducing that her adoptive father, Alexei Shostakov, would know Dreykov's location, Romanoff planned to break him out of the Seventh Circle Prison in Russia, so she contacted Rick Mason to get her a jet. However, he was only able to get them a helicopter, so Romanoff and Yelena Belova playfully questioned his capabilities. Mason also provided them with white suits, and told Romanoff that helping her was getting the attention of Thaddeus Ross before they departed.

Romanoff breaks out Alexei Shostakov
Flying to Russia, Romanoff used a Red Guardian action figure to smuggle a ear-com to Shostakov inside the prison, allowing him to follow her directions to escape. A riot broke out, making it harder for Shostakov to escape, so Romanoff jumped out of the helicopter and assisted him by fighting off the Russian Armed Forces. Belova accidentally caused an avalanche, so Romanoff hung from the helicopter and grabbed Shostakov before he could be killed, and brought him onboard the aircraft.

Romanoff is reunited with Alexei Shostakov
As they flew away, Shostakov expressed his gratitude that they came to rescue him, but Romanoff made it clear they only wanted information from him about how to get to the Red Room Academy, but he had no idea and instead rambled about being betrayed by Dreykov. However, Shostakov suggested that they ask their adoptive mother, Melina Vostokoff, due to her still working closely with Dreykov in St. Petersburg, so they headed there.

Family Reunion
Romanoff is praised by Alexei Shostakov
Crash landing before making it to Melina Vostokoff's farm and forced to walk, Romanoff and Yelena Belova continued to express their annoyance at Alexei Shostakov's behavior. Shostakov then spoke with Romanoff, as he wanted to know whether Captain America ever talk about him, which frustrated her more, leading to him asking if he did something wrong. Romanoff and Belova brought up the past, but Shostakov only saw it as a positive as both of his daughters went on to be renowned assassins, which made him proud, as he hugged them.

Romanoff reunited with her adoptive family
Finally reaching the farm, Romanoff was reuinted with her adoptive mother, who invited them all into her home, and they sat at the table, with Shostakov putting on his Red Guardian costume. Although Romanoff wanted to get down to business, Vostokoff and Shostakov were swept up with their family being back together again, much to her annoyance. Vostokoff then demonstrated what their mission in Ohio resulted in, which was how Dreykov could now completely control the Black Widows. Having had enough, Romanoff made it clear their family was not real, which deeply upset Belova, so she left.

Romanoff speaks with Melina Vostokoff
Shostakov went to check on Belova, leaving Romanoff with Vostokoff, where it was revealed that all Red Room assassins weren't abandoned but taken because of their genetic potential, and Romanoff's true mother searched for her until Dreykov had her killed. Romanoff noticed that Vostokoff had kept their photos, and they began to open up to each other about their past traumas, mending their relationship. The moment was cut short when Vostokoff revealed she had alerted the Red Room of their presence.

Destruction of the Red Room
Melina Vostokoff tells Romanoff the plan
Even though Melina Vostokoff initially betrayed her family, she was no longer loyal to the Red Room and decided to help Romanoff take them down, so they made a plan to infiltrate the base, using the Photostatic Veil to disguise themselves as each other, alert Thaddeus Ross to her location once inside, and land the base. Vostokoff also informed Romanoff of Dreykov's pheromones that prevented any violence against him.

Romanoff inside the Red Room Academy
Disguised as Vostofkoff, Romanoff found Yelena Belova and knocked her unconscious with her Bite, and had her, along with Alexei Shostakov and Vostokoff, brought onboard an aircraft to take them all to the Red Room Academy. Once inside the base, Romanoff made her way through, watching a room full of controlled Black Widows training, before going to meet with Dreykov. Pretending to be her adoptive mother to make Dreykov think she was still loyal, Romanoff acted as if she did not care for her family, as she was given orders to put Belova and "Romanoff" back under his control.

Romanoff learns Antonia Dreykov is alive
However, Dreykov was not fooled by Romanoff, and disabled the Photostatic Veil, ending the ruse. Romanoff asked Dreykov what her mother's name was, but he replied that the tombstone only read "Unknown." In attempt to enrage Dreykov, Romanoff brought up killing his daughter, but he only laughed, revealing that Taskmaster was his daughter. Dreykov proceeded to explain how she survived, and that he turned her into what she is now. When Taskmaster left, Romanoff pulled her gun out on Dreykov, but could not kill him.

Romanoff learns about the Black Widows
Romanoff then began to mock Dreykov for how pathetic he is, goading him into punching her repeatedly as she continued to antagonize him. Dreykov started to explain the Black Widow Program, and how many assassins he had stationed all over the world that could cause major world collapses in an instant. With everything she needed from Dreykov revealed, Romanoff smashed her face into a table, severing her nerve, as instructed by Vostokoff, preventing her from smelling Dreykov, allowing her to attack him.

Romanoff is confronted by the Black Widows
Before Romanoff could kill Dreykov, she was stopped by the Black Widows, who were then instructed by Dreykov to kill Romanoff. She held her own for a while, but they soon managed to overwhelm her, pinning her down and beating her up. Before they could kill her however, Belova saved her by detonating the Red Dust over all the Widows, releasing them from Dreykov's control. Belova helped her to her feet and painfully removed a knife from her back. Realizing the entire fortress was coming down, Romanoff instructed Belova and the Widows to get as far away as possible, sending them away first. Having stolen Dreykov's ring, she was able to upload all of the data on the Black Widows, and she cracked her nose back into place.

Black Widow releases Taskmaster from a cell
Once the data was collected, the base began to explode, forcing Romanoff to jump out of a window to avoid being killed. She managed to get back inside the base, where she came across Taskmaster locked in a cell. Knowing she was being controlled just the same as the other Widows, Black Widow decide to free her, before another explosion occurred, separating the two. Romanoff managed to land safely on the runway and saw Belova on top of Drekov's aircraft. Despite her sister's pleas, Belova shoved her baton into the engine, destroying it and throwing her off the edge.

Black Widow fights Taskmaster in the sky
Acting quickly, Romanoff grabbed a parachute and went after Belova as she fell through the sky. Romanoff managed to catch Belova and attach her to the parachute, only to then leave her when she spotted Taskmaster chasing after them in free fall. Romanoff and Taskmaster engaged in a duel as they fell to the ground, but before they hit, Taskmaster released her parachute, and Black Widow managed to grab onto her, so she landed safely.

Black Widow frees Antonia Dreykov
On the ground, Romanoff and Taskmaster continued their fight, with Romanoff dodging Taskmaster's sword attacks before stealing the weapon from her. However, Romanoff did not use it, instead trying unsuccessfully to defuse the fight between them. Romanoff managed to climb on top of Taskmaster and take off her helmet, allowing her to hit her with the Red Dust, freeing her from Dreykov's control. They both collapsed, and Romanoff apologized for what she had done to her, assuring her that Dreykov was finally gone.

Leaving her Family Fixed
Romanoff and Yelena Belova embrace
Romanoff then searched for Yelena Belova, and found her on the ground, which made her think she was dead, but she soon awoke. With the Red Room finally destroyed, Romanoff apologized to her sister for abandoning her, and admitted that their family was real to her, too, so they embraced each other.

Romanoff farewells her repaired family
Melina Vostokoff and Alexei Shostakov then regrouped with them, and Romanoff asked if Shostakov had anything to say, but he decided to not, knowing he'd mess it up. Instead, they held each other's hand, reconciling their issues. Noticing Thaddeus Ross driving up to their location with a fleet of soldiers, Romanoff told her family to leave while she stayed behind, which they were against doing. However, Romanoff insisted, as she had repaired her family, and decided to try and do the same with the Avengers. Belova gave Romanoff her vest.

Romanoff watches Thaddeus Ross' arrival
Romanoff then informed Belova that there were still a massive amount of Black Widows around the world, so once Vostokoff duplicated the Red Dust, she should go and free them all. They all then witnessed an aircraft land and the freed Widows exited, so Belova spoke with them, while Vostokoff and Shostakov said their goodbye to their daughter, telling her to take care of herself. After Romanoff and Belova did their whistle call to each other, she was left by herself amidst the rubble as Ross and his soldiers arrived and surrounded her, but she managed to escape.

Back on the Run
Romanoff speaks with Rick Mason
Two weeks later, Romanoff, having received a short haircut, dyed her hair blonde, and sporting Yelena Belova's vest, headed back to Ohio to meet up with Rick Mason who had provided her with a Quinjet. 

Romanoff talks about fixing the Avengers
Romanoff thanked Mason for his help, saying he's always been a good friend to her. Romanoff then talked about how for her whole life she had alway thought she never had a family, but she has now relaized she has two. And now that she has repaired one of them, she wanted to see if she could help fix the Avengers, which included breaking a few of them out of the Raft. Romanoff left Mason, and boarded the Quinjet to meet up with Steve Rogers, who was also currently on the run.

Romanoff leaves to free the Avengers
She then flew off and joined Rogers and Bucky Barnes in breaking Clint Barton, Sam Wilson, Wanda Maximoff, and Scott Lang from the Raft. Romanoff stayed with Rogers and Wilson, while Barton and Lang went into house arrest, and Maximoff fled to Scotland. Months later from going on the run, and evading capture thanks to their ties with S.H.I.E.L.D., Romanoff, Wilson, and Rogers were shortly met by Nick Fury. Romanoff used her KGB contacts to track down a terrorist organization supplied with Chitauri fueled weapons in Syria. Infiltrating the terrorists, Rogers, Wilson, and Romanoff disabled the weapons and then left for Lebanon.

Infinity War
Attack on Vision
Romanoff fighting Corvus Glaive
In 2018, Black Widow, Steve Rogers, and Sam Wilson received a call from Bruce Banner, who warned them about the threat as well as the fact that the Black Order were hunting the Mind Stone. The three headed down to Edinburgh, Scotland to protect Vision.

Romanoff fights the Black Order
The three arrived just in time and fended off Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive with great ease. While Rogers appeared behind a passing subway to distract Midnight, who attempted to finally finish off Wanda Maximoff and Vision, Falcon immediately attacked her, kicking her into a cafe inside the train station. Black Widow arrived moments later to assist in the fight. She appeared behind Glaive, who was attacked by Falcon, catching him by surprise and she managed to severely injure him using Midnight's spear.

Romanoff watches Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive escape
After which Falcon arrived and subdued Midnight, who was dueling both Rogers and Black Widow at the same time, Black Widow watched as he held Midnight and Glaive at gunpoint. Black Widow then claimed that they did not want to kill them but they would, Midnight taunted Black Widow that they will never get the chance again before retreating to their Q-Ship. Afterwards, Rogers decided to head back to the New Avengers Facility to try to help Vision, who was also severely injured.

Reuniting with Bruce Banner
Romanoff reunites with Bruce Banner
Arriving at New Avengers Facility, Romanoff and the others were greeted warmly by James Rhodes. Thaddeus Ross, present via a holographic video call, ordered Rhodes to arrest her, Steve Rogers, Sam Wilson, and Wanda Maximoff, but he disobeyed the order, cutting off the call. As Rhodes welcomed them back, Bruce Banner emerged, having been missing for over two years. Romanoff greeted Banner while Wilson commented that the meeting was awkward.

The Avengers discuss Thanos' plan
Banner then warned them about Thanos' threat, informing them that Thanos recently obtained both the Power and Space Stone during the Massacre of the Xandarians and the Attack on the Statesman, as well as the fact that Thanos has an enormous army ready to invade Earth. When asked about the others, Romanoff revealed to Banner that Clint Barton and Scott Lang were both on house arrests due to their involvement in the Avengers Civil War.

The Avengers discuss saving Vision
Romanoff then listened as Vision suggested that he would sacrifice himself to destroy the Mind Stone within him, only for Rogers and Maximoff to protest his statement. Vision instead reminded that Rogers was willing to sacrifice his life. Banner related back to Tony Stark's creation of J.A.R.V.I.S. and Ultron, suggesting that they could remove the stone imbedded within Vision without killing him. Rogers then claimed to know one place capable of doing that, Wakanda.

Arrival at Wakanda
The Avengers are greeted by the Wakandans
Romanoff and the Avengers arrived at the Golden City in Wakanda where they were greeted by T'Challa and the Dora Milaje. Rogers also reunited with Bucky Barnes, who had recently been cured of his HYDRA programming. The Avengers then met with Shuri, who explained how she planned on removing the Mind Stone from Vision.

Battle of Wakanda
Romanoff meets with the Black Order
Assembling the Avengers and the Wakandan armed forces to oppose the Black Order, Black Widow joined Steve Rogers and T'Challa in talking to Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian at the shield boundary. Black Widow inquired where Corvus Glaive was; Midnight intimated that he was dead. Midnight and Obsidian then initiated the Battle of Wakanda as they proceeded to release their army of Outriders.

Black Widow witnesses Thor's arrival
A great battle commenced after which T'Challa ordered the Dora Milaje to open up their defenses. The Black Order and Outriders swarmed the battlefield, attacking the Avengers. The Avengers became overwhelmed by the Outriders. However, the team and the Wakanda army were saved by the arrival of Rocket Raccoon, Groot, and Thor, who recently obtained his new weapon, Stormbreaker, from Nidavellir. The battle continued with the Avengers gaining the upper hand against Thanos' army.

Black Widow fights against Proxima Midnight
After facing off against the Outriders, Scarlet Witch was subdued by Midnight and was about to kill her, when Black Widow and Okoye intervened, preparing to face off against the alien warrior. Black Widow managed to fend off Midnight's attacks and then proceeded to fight back, outnumbering her. However, they were soon overwhelmed by Midnight's strength, and Black Widow was knocked out whilst Okoye was thrown to the ground. Midnight then approached a subdued Black Widow and put a blade to her.

Black Widow pinned by Proxima Midnight
When Midnight went to finish off Black Widow, only barely holding her back, Scarlet Witch used her powers to restrain Midnight and launch her into the path of one of Thanos' war machines, killing her, resulting in some of her blue blood being splattered across her face. Black Widow, lying on the floor, commented that Midnight's blood was gross before getting up and continuing to fight against Thanos' army. The Avengers then located Vision in a forest who prompted Scarlet Witch to destroy the Mind Stone within him while Black Widow and the Avengers awaited Thanos' arrival.

Black Widow is entrapped by stone pillars
Once Thanos finally arrived on Earth, Black Widow tried to stop him from obtaining the Mind Stone, but found that she and her allies were hopelessly outmatched by Thanos' use of the Infinity Gauntlet. While War Machine, Black Panther, Okoye, Bruce Banner, Falcon, and Winter Soldier were blasted away by the Power and Space Stones, Black Widow was subdued by Thanos who used the Reality Stone to form stone pillars to trap her.

Black Widow witnesses Thanos' victory
As Thanos united the six Infinity Stones, however, Thor impaled him with the Stormbreaker. Moments later, however, Thanos snapped his fingers and wiped out half of the life in the universe. Despite being weakened by a fatal blow from Thor's Stormbreaker, Thanos transported to the Garden, leaving Black Widow as one of the survivors of the genocide. She had freed herself from Thanos' prison as she and her remaining allies could do nothing but accept their defeat.

Meeting Captain Marvel
Romanoff observes the Snap's death count
Following the Battle of Wakanda, Romanoff, along with Steve Rogers, James Rhodes and Bruce Banner, returned to the New Avengers Facility. The Avengers sought out to hunt Thanos, using deep-space scans and satellites, only to have no results. Having discovered the Transmitter Pager in Atlanta that Nick Fury had activated before his death, the Avengers bypassed the pager's battery for it to continue to send out its signal. As Rogers and Romanoff were witnessing reports on the aftermath of the Snap, Rhodes, who was monitoring the pager, informed the pair and Banner that the pager had stopped transmitting the signal.

Romanoff tells the Avengers to track the signal

Rogers requested that they reboot the pager and resend the signal, only for Banner to respond that they had no idea what the signal was for. As Romanoff explained that Fury knew whom the signal was for and that she wanted to know who it was as well, she came face to face with Captain Marvel herself, who demanded to know where Fury was.
Ambush on Thanos
Romanoff witnesses the Benatar‚Äôs arrival
Twenty-three days after the Snap, Captain Marvel returned from her mission to find Tony Stark, carrying Benatar towards the New Avengers Facility. The Avengers, along with Pepper Potts stood outside and witnessed Stark exit the ship, along with Nebula.

Romanoff talks about the Snap
They all then gathered inside where Romanoff informed Danvers and Stark of the Snap and the effects that have occurred since. As they continued to talk about Thanos, Stark began to get angry because of the encounter he had with Thanos alone. However, due to being in a weak state, he collapsed so Bruce Banner tended to him while the others waited. When Danvers decided to go out and find Thanos on her own, Romanoff stopped her, informing her that they work as a team.

Romanoff learns of the Infinity Stones' activity
Nebula then joined the conversation and informed them of Thanos' location, the Garden ‚Äî a place that Thanos planned to retreat to after the Snap, where Rocket Raccoon told them of a power surge that occurred two days ago. They then began to discuss going after Thanos, where they planned to retrieve the Infinity Stones and bring everyone back, something that Romanoff felt they owed to those who were gone because of the Snap.

The Avengers agree to ambush Thanos
As they continued to discuss the plan, Danvers told them that they would be successful because they had her this time, causing an annoyed War Machine to retort back at her. As she claimed that many other planets in the universe did not have a team like the Avengers, Thor, who had been silent for all of this, got up, and summoned Stormbreaker to prove she was worthy. Danvers did not blink and Thor exclaimed his fondness for her. With all the Avengers on board with the plan, they all suited up and boarded the Benatar.

Romanoff on board the Benatar
A team of Steve Rogers, Black Widow, Thor, Captain Marvel, Nebula, Banner, Rocket and War Machine all made their way to the Garden by making a jump through space. Rocket asked them not to throw up on his ship, having learned that they have never been to space, with the exception of Nebula. When they arrived at the planet, Captain Marvel exited the ship to do recon while the others waited.

Romanoff with Steve Rogers before the attack
Black Widow saw Rogers look at his compass, and reassured him that the plan was going to work, to which he responded by saying he wouldn't know what to do if it didn't. Captain Marvel then returned and updated the Avengers that it was only just Thanos on the planet. They then began their ambush, with Captain Marvel bursting into his home, placing him in a headlock. Bruce Banner in the Iron Man Armor: Mark XLVIII quickly joined her, restraining the Infinity Gauntlet, with War Machine holding Thanos' other arm.

Black Widow confronts Thanos in the Garden
Thor then arrived and sliced off Thanos' left hand with Stormbreaker, releasing the Gauntlet and causing great pain to the Titan. Rogers, Black Widow, and Rocket Raccoon then entered the hut, and they were all shocked when they saw that the stones were no longer in the gauntlet. Under interrogation, Thanos revealed that his most recent usage of the Infinity Stones had been to destroy them, ensuring that he could not be tempted to use them again and that the Snap could not be undone.

Black Widow is disquieted by their failure

The Avengers initially believed Thanos to be lying, so Black Widow demanded the location of the Infinity Stones, but Thanos assured them they were gone and that he was nearly killed because of it. Nebula addressed that while her adoptive father was many things, a liar isn't one of those things. Thor then cut off Thanos' head, killing him. He then left, leaving a feeling of despair amongst them all.
Leading the Avengers
Keeping Her Family Together
Romanoff as leader of the Avengers
With the Mad Titan's victory seemingly final, the Avengers spent the next five years moving on: Tony Stark started a family; Steve Rogers held support group meetings; Thor set New Asgard on Earth; and Bruce Banner merged himself with Hulk. However, being alone all her life until she was a part of the Avengers, which she saw as her family, Romanoff continued the team, with James Rhodes staying on board and Carol Danvers, Rocket Raccoon, Nebula, and Okoye joining as new members. They operated on a bigger scale than they used to, helping reform the world back to normal after the Snap and dealing with threats in outer space as well.

Romanoff during a meeting with the Avengers
Due to her affiliation with the Avengers and her role in trying to stop Thanos, Romanoff was legally forgiven for her violation of the Sokovia Accords back in 2016. This allowed her to operate as the official leader of the Avengers. In 2023, Romanoff held a meeting with the Avengers, who were all at different locations, where she was provided with updates on what they were each doing. When the meeting concluded, Romanoff reminded them that the channel would always be open if there was ever a problem. Rhodes stayed on the channel, telling her that he was in Mexico, still following Barton, telling her that after witnessing the scene he had left, he was not sure if he even wanted to find Barton.

Romanoff cries about Clint Barton
However, Romanoff asked if he could keep looking anyway. When he left, Romanoff began to cry over the thought of her best friend until Rogers entered the room. Rogers, noticing his friend was in distress, attempted to comfort her, but she stopped him from telling her to look on the bright side by jokingly threatening to hit him with her sandwich. When Rogers sat down, the two began to discuss moving on, something Rogers had been telling others but was not reciprocated by them.

Romanoff talks about her life

Romanoff pointed out that if she didn't lead the Avengers, no one would, something Rogers believed might be fine. However, Romanoff told him that she used to have nothing in her life until she became an Avenger, giving her a family and making her better. She then addressed that even though people are gone, she was still trying to be better, which Rogers then stated that they both needed to get a life.
Scott Lang's Return
Romanoff learns about the Quantum Realm
Suddenly, an alert appeared for the front entrance camera, so Romanoff opened it revealing Scott Lang to be standing outside. They then let him inside, where he asked them if they studied Quantum Physics, which Romanoff said she was, only for conversation.

Romanoff listens to Scott Lang's theory
Lang then told them about how he got trapped in the Quantum Realm five years ago due to the Snap. Lang then revealed that for him, it was actually five hours in the Quantum Realm. Rogers then tried to get Lang to clarify what he was saying, which was that time works differently in the Quantum Realm, but there is no way to navigate it. He proposed the idea to control the Quantum Realm, entering at one point in time and exiting out another.

Romanoff visits Tony Stark
However, none of them knew how to handle this idea, so they decided to visit Tony Stark, who was living a normal life with his family. They drove to his house and sat down with him to discuss Lang's idea, but Stark was opposed to it. Romanoff told Stark that they had to try, but he continued to refuse. Stark then left them when his daughter came out, causing them to leave without his help. Rogers then suggested another brain they could use to help them, Bruce Banner.

Time Travel
Romanoff meets up with Bruce Banner
The three then met up with Banner in a diner, who explained to Lang his new transformation into a mixture of Banner and Hulk. They were then interrupted by some kids who wanted a picture with Banner, and when they left, Banner informed them that Time Travel was outside his area of expertise, but Romanoff reminded him that he was able to merge his two personas, something that seemed impossible before.

Romanoff witnesses the experiment
He then agreed to help them, and they returned to the facility to work on navigating the Quantum Realm to ensure time travel. They then began to test time travel, with Lang wearing the Quantum Realm Exploration Suit. When Banner mentioned not wanting something to go wrong and have Lang stuck in the past, Romanoff said he was joking, but Banner was unsure of that, due to the uncertainty of the experiment. Banner set the machine up to send Lang back a week and bring him back in ten seconds.

Romanoff tries to return Scott Lang to his age

They then activated the machine, which sent Lang into the Quantum Realm, and when they brought him back, he was a child. Banner then tried to fix this error by sending him back, but when he returned he was an old man, followed by a third try which brought Lang back as a baby. Banner then told Romanoff to kill the power on his signal, which successfully returned Lang to his normal age.
