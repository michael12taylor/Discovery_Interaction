<html><p>Regenerative Healing Factor: Spider-Man's increased metabolism allows him to rapidly heal and regenerate from harm faster and more extensively than normal humans can recover from. He was able to rapidly heal from a black eye from Giant-Man after nearly a day had passed. After suffering multiple wounds from his fight with Vulture, Parker's scars were fully healed in a matter of hours. He similarly recovered in mere hours from many bruises and cuts he gained during the Battle of Earth, after Sanctuary II opened fire on the battlefield and then during Mysterio's ambush on him, in which he was repeatedly attacked by Stark Industries Combat Drones disguised with holographic illusions and then being struck at full force by a speeding train after being lured into its path by the illusions.
Wall-crawling: Spider-Man can adhere to walls, ceilings, and other surfaces in order to scale them and has stated that he does not use any adhesive gloves or fabrics to do it. This ability allows him to stick to almost any surface when willing himself to, as physical contact with said surfaces creates a locking connection necessary to support his body, even when he is inverted above the ground. Alternatively, Parker could make individual portions of his body adhesive, which allowed him to stick his foot onto the chest of a bank robber to fling him into a wall. He was able to have a car stick onto his hand and easily lifting as well without required strong grip when fighting against armies of drones lead by Mysterio.
Abilities
Genius-level Intellect: Peter Parker is a highly intelligent science enthusiast, with aptitudes in chemistry, physics, and engineering. His intellect was praised by some of the smartest people in the world such as Tony Stark himself (who considered him a candidate for MIT) and Quentin Beck (who described Peter as "smart as a whip"). In addition, Parker was a valued member of the Midtown School of Science and Technology academic decathlon team, with Liz Toomes claiming that Parker was its most intelligent member and strongest asset in physics and his other teammates being distressed when he briefly dropped out of the team. Parker is also an intellectual rival of Flash Thompson, whom he often effortlessly upstaged in class.
Parker concocting web fluid
Expert Scientist: Parker displayed knowledge in various fields of science. He developed a highly advanced chemical compound into a silk-like material (the sophistication of which even impressed Tony Stark), using salicylic acid, toulene, methanol, carbon tetrachloride, potassium carbonate, and ethyl acetate to make it sticky, malleable, load-bearing, strong, hold with extreme amounts of tension and stress, yet have a little stretch to it. He later quickly deduced the composition of Falcon's wings based on their relationship between rigidity and flexibility, despite only witnessing their usage in a short span of time. Parker also has knowledge in physics; he was able to quickly solve a physics problem (calculating linear acceleration between points A and B) with just a glance at the board and is well-versed in the multiverse theory, comprehending that it changes how humans understand the initial singularity due to an eternal inflation system. Parker is also well-read and good at math, claiming to have "nailed" an algebra test the day Stark recruited him.
Expert Engineer: Parker has an affinity for working on and building computers, and has become an expert when it comes to creating new technology. As such, he constructed his own web-shooters with over-the-counter materials along with his first Spider-Man Suit and goggles. Furthermore, when deprived of his former suits, Parker managed to take for himself all of Stark's previous designs to create a suit of his own using Stark technology, which caused Happy Hogan to smile as it reminded him of Stark's engineering genius. Parker also quickly understands how to utilize artificial intelligence to his advantage, as his performance with Karen led Stark to entrust him with E.D.I.T.H., a multi-billion dollar augmented reality tactical intelligence system.
Skilled Tactician: Parker draws from pop culture when formulating strategies, notably when he let Iron Man and War Machine know of his plan to tie up Ant-Man's legs, after which they knocked the immobilized giant down. In a similar fashion, Parker devised a plan to rescue Doctor Strange from Ebony Maw by ejecting him out of his Q-Ship through a hull breach. He also uses the laws of physics to his advantage, such as when he used the lift from a SWAT team's helicopter blades to his advantage to get enough momentum to break a window in order to save his classmates. Parker is still relatively inexperienced, however, since he asked Iron Man for advice during the Avengers Civil War, and later consistently asked for Karen's assistance in taking down Vulture and his gang. Following his battles in space against the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thanos, as well as the battle for Earth, Parker seems to have grown in this ability in the eight months following Stark's sacrifice, being able to fight against the highly intelligent Mysterio, circumventing his illusions and ultimately stopping his plans.
Investigator: Parker was able to effectively utilize his suit's video archives and Karen's access to law enforcement databases to generate suspects to interrogate and locate Vulture and his illegal weapons trade, notably producing the identity Aaron Davis.
Spider-Man briefly subdues Captain America
Combatant: After fighting crime for six months, Parker's combat style developed into a somewhat instinctive and improvised collection of techniques that emphasizes the use of his superhuman strength, speed, agility, and Web-Shooters. Hence, Parker uses quick, powerful attacks and agile movements while firing his webs to immobilize his enemies. However, Parker is not skilled in martial arts as his style is self-taught and he often gets distracted while in combat. Despite his inexperience, Spider-Man easily defeated both Falcon and Winter Soldier, two military-trained hand-to-hand combatants, as well as temporarily held his own against the far more experienced Captain America; according to Iron Man, however, Rogers was holding back during that fight and could have beaten Parker easily. Parker also fought against Vulture despite the latter repeatedly besting him in combat. Because of his limited experience, Parker was easily subdued by Shocker during their brawl due to him heavily relying on his Web-Shooters for offensive attacks. Later on, Parker had somewhat improved his skills but remained vastly outclassed by experienced fighters, as shown when he and his allies fought the Guardians of the Galaxy and later when he briefly fought Thanos. While Parker was able to briefly duel the highly skilled Star-Lord, he was quickly subdued by the latter's equipment. Due to his predictable combat style during the Battle of Titan, Thanos defeated Spider-Man in moments after recognizing his attack pattern, but nevertheless Parker managed to stagger him. Furthermore, during the Battle of Earth, Parker was capable of handling group fights with each incoming attack but despite activating the Instant-Kill mode in his suit, he was easily overwhelmed by the sheer number of Outriders that were called for assistance. After the Battle of Earth, Parker seems to have improved as a fighter, but still relied heavily on the Iron Spider Armor, as seen when he went against the Manfredi Crime Family. Against Mysterio and his army of drones, Parker opted to rely on his physical abilities to best him, also taking full advantage of his superior senses and early awareness of danger.
Expert Marksman: Spider-Man possesses extremely keen eyesight, and is able to accurately utilize his Web-Shooters to neutralize his targets during his crime-fighting. He was capable of simultaneously ensnaring Captain America's hands and strip him of his shield, mid-air, executing it all at high speed. Parker was also able to precisely shoot a Spider-Tracer onto Herman Schultz's foot across a classroom, and ensnare and latch onto Vulture's Exo-Suit with little effort despite the rig moving at incredible speeds at times, notably during the Hijacking of the Stark Cargo Plane.
Spider-Man swinging through New York City
Master Acrobat: Due to his superhuman agility, Spider-Man can perform acrobatic and gymnastic feats, such as flips, with little effort. Hence, he was able to accurately shoot a string of webbing at Captain America's Shield, then caught it mid-air and land on a vehicle. While wearing the Iron Spider Armor, Parker's coordination is greatly enhanced, allowing him to easily navigate throughout the environment of Titan, rescuing Mantis, Star-Lord, and Drax mid-air while swinging through the obstacles affected by the planet's gravitational distortions, as well as effortlessly dodge plasma blasts from an accomplished marksman like Star-Lord.
Multilingualism: Parker speaks his native English, as well as some Spanish, studying the language in school with success and being able to understand enough to know a quip Delmar was making about his aunt, May Parker, and then make his own quip about the deli owner's daughter. Parker also knows Italian, as displayed in his text messages with Ned Leeds before their trip to Europe and when he accidentally spoke the language in Prague.
Equipment
Uniforms
Spider-Man wearing his new upgraded suit
Spider-Man Suit: Parker originally wore a handmade suit while operating on the streets of New York City. Nothing more than a red hoodie, blue sweats, and a pair of goggles, this suit was created with the intention to help Parker to conceal his identity and keep his superhuman senses in check. Parker would later use an upgraded and much more refined suit designed by Tony Stark to better focus his superhuman senses. The new suit also included moving eyepieces that resemble camera shutters to filter out stimuli while in use.
Utility Belt: The suit has a utility belt seamlessly integrated into it. It contains spare web fluid cartridges for Spider-Man's Web-Shooters.
Spider-Drone: The spider emblem on the front of Parker's suit can detach and act as a reconnaissance device. It has a drone mode allowing it to fly onto a target for Parker to follow.
GPS Tracking System: In his right Web-Shooter, Parker has access to the suit's GPS tracking system via a holographic display, allowing him to follow his Spider-Drone.
Karen: After deactivating the Training Wheels Protocol, Parker's suit now features an A.I. user interface program similar to J.A.R.V.I.S. and F.R.I.D.A.Y. that provides diagnostic and tactical reports.

Iron Spider Armor: Following his confrontation with Vulture, Tony Stark presented the newly created Iron Spider Armor for Parker to use as the newest member of the Avengers, but Parker declined the offer. After initially rejecting the suit, Parker was ultimately given the armor to help during his pursuit of a Q-Ship over New York City, and later during the Battle of Titan. The suit was composed of nanites, similarly to Tony Stark's latest Iron Man suit, and was able to manifest four armored spider-legs from the rear spider symbol, which granted Spider-Man greater mobility and better grip on his surroundings.
Former Equipment
Jester Mask: During the Battle in the Grand Canal, Peter used a jester mask to hide his identity, after he left his suit in his hotel room, in order to help Mysterio battle Hydro-Man.
Weapons
Parker examining his new Web-Shooters
Web-Shooters: A pair of wrist-mounted mechanical devices used by Spider-Man to project synthetic webbing. Parker invented the first pair while Tony Stark created a new and improved pair to go along with his new suit. Though, this new pair supplied by Stark merely involved technological improvements and a few new features while the overall mechanics and webbing itself Stark did not attempt to replace. The upgraded Web-Shooters come with selective web types and a laser targeting system for accuracy. Parker finds the amount of possible Web-Shooter combinations Stark included to be excessive.
Synthetic Webbing: Created by Peter Parker himself, this web-like organic chemical substance is meant to emulate the silk created by the common spider, while its composition and tensile strength are substantial enough to greatly impress Tony Stark himself. This synthetic spider silk is used by Parker to help swing around New York City, bind and tie up enemies, steal weapons, and make other useful applications. Spider-Man combines this synthetic web with agile movements to dodge enemy attacks and often targets the enemies' arms and legs to break their balance and immobilize them. The chemical compound was so durable that both Captain America and Winter Soldier had trouble breaking it, despite their enhanced strength. Parker can also fabricate his web compound with ordinary school chemicals used while in chemistry classes. According to himself, the webs take about two hours to dissipate. The latest formula developed is his 3.01 version.
Spider-Signal: A red light emitted from Spider-Man's web-shooters, which Tony Stark added much to Parker's surprise and delight.
Spider-Tracer: A small tracker designed by Tony Stark that resembles a spider. Parker planted the tracker on Herman Schultz and used it to track his gang's movements.

Tony Stark's Glasses: Following the death of Tony Stark, Peter was given the glasses that Tony had previously used. Using these, Peter was given access to E.D.I.T.H., an advanced A.I. designed by Stark, which gave Peter access to all the Stark Industries databases and satellite system.
Vehicles
Stark Industries Private Jet: After being recruited by Tony Stark to assist his team in the fight against Captain America's team during the Avengers Civil War, Parker boarded the Stark Industries Private Jet to go to Germany to assist in the fight. Much later before his final battle with Mysterio, Peter is given access to the Private Jet, this time to build his own suit to his own specifications.
Q-Ship: Parker and Tony Stark broke into the Q-Ship to rescue Doctor Strange, who had been kidnapped by Ebony Maw. Stark killed Maw by ejecting him into outer space and Parker saved Strange from being sucked out into space. The trio then used the ship to travel to Titan and stop Thanos.
Facilities
Parker goes inside his apartment home
Parker Residence: The Parker Residence is the apartment home to May and Peter Parker. When Tony Stark is required to bring Captain America and his team into custody, Stark goes to Queens to recruit Parker. After Spider-Man's battle at the airport with the Avengers, Aunt May aided Parker's bruise in his room. When Spider-Man had returned home, Ned Leeds had been inside of his room all along and had witnessed Parker crawling across the ceiling while wearing his Spider-Man Suit. Returning to the Residence, Parker and Leeds used the Tracer on Shocker's boot to begin following the gang's current movements as they made their way outside of New York City. After asking Liz Toomes to go to homecoming with him, Parker returned to his home and asked Aunt May for her assistance. Once he returned back home, Parker discovered that Stark had returned his suit, putting it on again, until Aunt May shockingly saw him wearing the suit.
Parker at his locker with Ned Leeds
Midtown School of Science and Technology: Midtown School of Science and Technology is a high school that Parker and his best friend Ned Leeds attend as students. It also had an Academic Decathlon Team that is managed by Roger Harrington and led by Liz Toomes; only now appointed to Michelle Jones as the new team's captain. Parker took advantage of the school's equipment for his Spider-Man activity, using the chemistry labs to synthesize his web fluid and hiding his homemade suit below a series of lockers.
Kurhotel Ströszek: The Kurhotel Ströszek is a hotel in Germany that Parker had stayed in with Happy Hogan and Tony Stark before the Clash of the Avengers. After the fight, Parker spent the night at the hotel before going home the next day. While in Germany and at the hotel, Parker made a video diary.
Hotel DeMatteis: Hotel DeMatteis is a hotel in Venice where Parker stayed in with his classmates during their trip before the subsequent appearances of Hydro-Man and Mysterio during the Battle in the Grand Canal.

Trivia
In the comics, Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider that granted him superpowers. Upon the death of his uncle, Ben Parker, due to Parker's indifference, he decided to become a selfless hero.
One of Tony Stark’s guesses as to Parker’s superhero alias was “Spiderling”. In the comics, this name is used by Parker’s daughter, Annie Parker, on Earth-18119.
Parker's birthday being August 10th is a reference to Amazing Fantasy Vol. 1 #15, where Spider-Man made his first appearance and was published on August 10, 1962.
Parker is a fan of the indie rock band Alt-J and Led Zeppelin.
Parker is a Star Wars fan and a Lego collector. Parker has Star Wars action figures and Lego models of the Death Star, a X-Wing fighter, and a AT-AT Walker. He also referenced The Empire Strikes Back during the Clash of the Avengers.
Despite this, Tom Holland is not a big Star Wars fan and has never seen the original trilogy, though he did enjoy Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Rogue One, as well as the prequel trilogy when he was a child.

Parker is a fan of the New York Mets.
Parker's school locker is #1184.
Spider-Man is one of three superheroes who defeated the main antagonist of their first standalone movie without any assistance, the other two being Hulk and Ant-Man.
Spider-Man is the second superhero to star in two solo films in the same phase, with the first being Iron Man.
Parker began his sophomore year of high school in 2016, meaning he was originally set to graduate in 2019 prior to the Snap.
In the comics, a version inspired of MCU Spider-Man appeared in Spider-Verse #3 and in Spider-Geddon #5 as part of the Spider-Army assembled to fight the Inheritors led by the Earth-616's Spider-Man.
Behind the Scenes
Spider-Man was first indirectly referenced in an alternate version of the post-credits scene for Iron Man, in which Nick Fury mentioned to Tony Stark about "radioactive bug bites" on the "bigger universe" he has become part. This version ultimately went unused from the finished film, likely because Sony Pictures Studios owns the film rights of Spider-Man.
Joss Whedon wanted to include Spider-Man at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron, but was unable to do so because the deal with Sony Pictures Studios had yet to be completed during filming.
Tom Holland made audition tapes together with Jon Bernthal while filming Pilgrimage, both landing their roles of Peter Parker and Frank Castle respectively.
Tom Holland learned that he had been cast as Spider-Man on Instagram: "I was actually having a really bad day, and I found out on Instagram. I was in my bed, I was scrolling through Instagram, and Marvel had posted a photo of Spider-Man. It said, 'Go to our website, and find out who it is'. I opened the screen, and then it said my name, and I went nuts."
During his audition, Tom Holland mentioned that Robert Downey, Jr. gave him advice, saying "Listen, I remember my screen test for Iron Man. I remember how terrified I was. Just think of it as an audition. It's nothing too scary. If you get it wrong, we'll just start again. No pressure.."
Max Favreau, the son of Jon Favreau, had a role as an "Expo Kid" in Iron Man 2 which was later retconned as a young Peter Parker. This is a nod to the relationship shared between Happy Hogan and Parker in Spider-Man: Homecoming.
In an interview with the Huffington Post, Holland confirmed that the child that Iron Man rescues from the Hammer Drones in Iron Man 2 was, in fact, Peter Parker after "literally" having conversation with Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige "only 20 minutes ago." Jon Watts revealed in an interview with Uproxx that the boy retroactively revealed to be Parker was portrayed by Jon Favreau's son, Max Favreau.

Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the fourth live-action incarnation of the character, following incarnations portrayed by Nicholas Hammond, Tobey Maguire, and Andrew Garfield.
Tom Holland has stated that while he has not been in contact with either of them, he will take inspiration in his performance from both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's incarnations of Spider-Man.
Unlike previous incarnations, this Spider-Man's agility and athleticism were performed by actor Tom Holland due to his history in dance and gymnastics, thereby allowing a majority of the stunts to be produced practically and without CGI.

Tom Holland mentioned that he has signed on for three Spider-Man movies and three other Marvel films, bringing a total of six films in his contract.
Asa Butterfield, Charlie Rowe, Judah Lewis, Matt Lintz and Charlie Plummer were the final contenders for Spider-Man with Rowe being the runner-up for the role.
In Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man kicks but never punches. Holland noted it was a conscious decision to emphasize Parker's age: "Every decision we make on set is based off, 'How would a kid react in this situation?' so every fight scene we have is designed in a way that's almost child-friendly, so he never actually punches anyone. It's all done [by him] kind of by accident."
In the Italian dubbing of the Iron Fist episode Eight Diagram Dragon Palm, Ward Meachum mentions Spider-Man when he compares Danny Rand's scaling of a building, instead of Daredevil.
Spider-Man is mentioned in the Wu-Tang Clan song "Protect Ya Neck," which is featured in The Defenders episode The Defenders.
This version of Parker served as one of the inspirations for one of the Spider-Men featured in the Sony Pictures Animation film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. There were also plans to include Holland's Spider-Man in an scene which would have featured him alongside Maguire's and Garfield's versions of the character, but the scene was scrapped due to fears it would have been far too convoluted.
The Falcon and The Winter Soldier showrunner Malcolm Spellman stated in an interview with Inverse that there were plans to include Spider-Man in the first season finale "One World, One People", as the episode takes place in New York City, but Kevin Feige convinced him to not include Spidey because he didn't belong to the story in an organic way.
Marvin Ross, Holland Diaz, Danny Downey, David Elson, Alrik Kreemke, Chris Silcox, Christian Peden, Luke Scott, Greg Townley and John Flanagan were stunt doubles for Tom Holland in the role of Spider-Man.
Diaz and Elson were both stunt doubles for previous cinematic incarnations of Spider-Man. Diaz doubled for Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man 3 and Elson doubled for Andrew Garfield in The Amazing Spider-Man.
Diaz and Elson were both stunt doubles for previous cinematic incarnations of Spider-Man. Diaz doubled for Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man 3 and Elson doubled for Andrew Garfield in The Amazing Spider-Man.
Ian Kyle Findley, Freddy Parkington, and Shane Hibbard were stand-ins for Tom Holland in the role of Spider-Man.
Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Black Widow are the only characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to receive a solo movie following their debut.
This version of the character is featured in the post-credit scene of Venom: Let There Be Carnage which ties into the ending of Spider-Man: Far From Home.
