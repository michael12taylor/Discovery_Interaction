<html><p>Scepter: After HYDRA collapsed, the Scepter was then retrieved by the Avengers when Tony Stark later borrowed it to research and experiment its power to complete the Ultron Program. The Scepter was taken and dismantled by Ultron after shattering its blue gem casing, which in the process reveals the Mind Stone inside.
Mind Stone: The Mind Stone was originally portrayed as a containment vessel and a power source for the Scepter. Ultron, who used its power to enthrall Helen Cho, in order to make him a new body with a combination of her expertise using the Regeneration Cradle and Ultron's supply of vibranium. He later broke the Scepter to claim the jewel, so he could use its power to evolve into a perfect body.
Others
Ultron claiming Ulysses Klaue's vibranium
Vibranium: With plans of creating a perfect form being thwarted, Ultron decided on a compromise in which he used parts of the remaining vibranium to create a more durable robotic body while using the rest of the vibranium to strengthen the core structure of his device. To terrify Natasha Romanoff, Ultron ripped apart his current body and showed her his new upgraded form.
Ultron builds Vision in the Regeneration Cradle
Regeneration Cradle: Ultron coerced Helen Cho to use her Regeneration Cradle and the vibranium to construct a new, more powerful body for Ultron. Though Helen Cho said that the Cradle could not create a functioning body, Ultron disagreed and stated she merely lacked the proper tools. Ultron used the Scepter to control Cho and began work to create a body.
Vehicles
U-GIN Truck: Ultron used this truck to try to transport the Regeneration Cradle out of South Korea but his plans were foiled by the Avengers.
Quinjet: During the Battle of Sokovia, Ultron manages to take control of it and uses its weapons systems against Hulk and Black Widow and then to kill Quicksilver.
Facilities
Avengers Tower: Having been originally activated through the experiments with the Scepter, Ultron built himself his first body by using pieces of a broken Iron Legion robot, having found the pieces in the Avengers Tower. With his new body, Ultron stepped out into the Avengers Tower main hall, where he confronted the Avengers, explaining that he had killed J.A.R.V.I.S. and explaining his plan for peace via destruction. Ultron would then attack the Avengers with an army of hijacked Iron Legion robots, before being defeated, with Thor destroying Ultron's first body, only for his mind to escape from the tower via the internet.
HYDRA Research Base: Having escaped from Avengers Tower, Ultron would then taken over HYDRA's research base in Sokovia, which had been abandoned following the defeat and capture of Baron Wolfgang von Strucker. From here, Ultron built his army of Ultron Sentries, as well as his Doomsday Trigger which he intended to use to complete his goals. Ultron also brought Pietro and Wanda Maximoff there to see his work in the base, and recruited them into his war against the Avengers, as they discussed their own motivations to defeat the Avengers. Ultron would continue building his army of Ultron Sentries here, while he captured Black Widow and held her captive inside the base, explaining his scheme and motivations to her, before showing his newly built Vibranium form to her, leaving her behind to die once he destroyed the entire city.
Novi Grad Church: Ultron used the church in the center of Novi Grad to meet with the Maximoff twins, commenting to her that the people of Sokovia had built the church in the exact center of the city, which he admired. Ultron would also place his Doomsday Trigger in the church, which he unveiled to Iron Man during their confrontation, explaining his plan to turn the city into a meteor and destroy all life on the Earth. As the Avengers attempted to stop Ultron from activating the trigger, Ultron launched an assault upon the church, but was held back by the Avengers, until eventually, once all the Avengers had been distracted, he was able to send a final Sentry to activate the key.
U-GIN Genetic Research Facility: Having successfully obtained the Scepter from the Avengers and Vibranium from Ulysses Klaue, Ultron traveled to this facility in Seoul to force Helen Cho to build him a new body, threatening to execute her staff if she refused, and using the Mind Stone to put her under his control. However, while Cho was using the Regeneration Cradle to build the body, Wanda Maximoff learnt of Ultron's true plans, causing her and her brother to free Cho from Ultron's control and escape, while Cho stopped the transfer of Ultron's mind into the body. With that Ultron attacked Cho and her staff, before being forced to escape, as the Avengers arrived.

Trivia
In the comics, Ultron was traditionally created by Hank Pym; however, Joss Whedon has stated that in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ultron's origin would be different, relating more to the current roster of Avengers already established in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Marvel Cinematic Universe iteration of Ultron is thus the second one depicting him as having been created by Tony Stark rather than Hank Pym; the first time was in the Marvel Animated Features direct-to-video film Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow.
In the comics, Ultron created Vision, Jocasta, Victor Mancha and Alkhema. All of them betrayed Ultron, in which Vision and Jocasta even joined the Avengers with Victor Mancha joining the Runaways respectively.
Ultron recites "I've Got No Strings," a song from Pinocchio, a Walt Disney film about an inanimate puppet who gains sentience; Ultron serves as a dark parallel of Pinocchio.
The scene where Ultron first meets Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, while sitting on a throne and wearing a hood over his head is an allusion to Ultron's first appearance in the comics, when he was disguised as Crimson Cowl.
Ultron is the second main villain to be destroyed through the power of an Infinity Stone, the first being Ronan the Accuser.
Ultron had planned to adopt a humanoid appearance and wield the power of an Infinity Stone, in which the base synthetic body would eventually become Vision. Similarly in the comics, Ultron had planned to adopt a humanoid appearance through the possession of Adam Warlock's body; in which Warlock himself had previously possessed an Infinity Stone.
Ultron was made of adamantium in the comics rather than vibranium, and was actually the first Marvel character to have it (this change is likely due to adamantium being part of the X-Men film series universe at the time the film, Avengers: Age of Ultron, was created).
Behind the Scenes
Director Joss Whedon has elaborated on Ultron's character saying, "He's always trying to destroy the Avengers, goddamn it, he's got a bee in his bonnet. He's not a happy guy, which means he's an interesting guy. He's got pain. And the way that manifests is not going to be standard robot stuff."
Whedon would further add that Ultron is "not a creature of logic – he's a robot who's genuinely disturbed. We're finding out what makes him menacing and at the same time endearing and funny and strange and unexpected, and everything a robot never is."
James Spader described Ultron as being "self-absorbed" and added, "I think he sees the Avengers as being part of a problem, a more comprehensive problem in the world. He sees the world from a very strange, biblical point of view because he's brand new, he's very young... He's immature, and yet has knowledge of comprehensive, broad history and precedent, and he has created in a very short period of time a rather skewed worldview."
Ultron's main form (curved antennae, internal torso lighting, and prominent shoulders) seems heavily inspired by modern depictions of the character as seen in the "Annihilation: Conquest" and "Age of Ultron" comic book crossover series as opposed to his classic depictions.
Ultron's planned final form in the film was more humanoid in appearance and served as the host body that would eventually be used to create Vision. This isn't the first time that Ultron desired to create a powerful humanoid body, as he has been depicted as adopting a fully humanoid appearance twice within the comics; using the Wasp and Adam Warlock as his body templates respectively.
Ultron's primary form is officially dubbed as "Ultron Prime" while his vibranium form is officially dubbed as "Ultimate Ultron."
Ultron's scheme of raising Sokovia as a city in the sky is a homage to Hayao Miyazaki's film and Studio Ghibli's first animated feature, Castle in the Sky.
Ultron was brought to life through motion capture by both James Spader and the 7' 7½" tall actor and former basketball player Neil Fingleton.
Roy Taylor was a stunt double for James Spader in the role of Ultron.
James Spader was initially approached by the crew of Avengers: Damage Control to reprise his role as Ultron, but he was unavailable due to scheduling conflicts, leading Ultron to be recast with Ross Marquand.
