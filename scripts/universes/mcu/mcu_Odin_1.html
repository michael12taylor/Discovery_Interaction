Odin Borson was the former King of Asgard, son of Bor, husband of Frigga, father of Hela and Thor, the adoptive father of Loki, and the former protector of the Nine Realms. During the ancient times, he was worshiped as the god of wisdom by the inhabitants of Earth. Once the greatest warrior in all the Nine Realms, over the centuries he learned how to appreciate peace, eventually banishing his own daughter to Hel when she attempted to subjugate the entire universe. When Thor almost provoked a new war with the Frost Giants of Jotunheim, Odin stripped him of his powers and exiled him to Earth, leaving Loki to take the throne. Around this time, Odin unexpectedly fell into the Odinsleep, and when Thor had returned and saved the Frost Giants from extinction at the hands of Loki, who seemingly lost his life during the conflict, Odin realized that Thor had proven that he would be worthy enough to take the throne of Asgard.

Loki survived his fall into the abyss and was captured by Thor after causing the Chitauri Invasion of Earth, causing Odin to sentence him to life in prison. When Odin's own wife Frigga was killed at the hands of the Dark Elves' leader Malekith, Odin vowed revenge on them, no matter the cost, putting him at odds with his son. After faking his death, Loki cast a spell on Odin, banishing him to New York City while masquerading as Odin and ruling Asgard himself. While he had eventually recovered from the spell placed on him by Loki, Odin chose to remain in exile in Norway and would ultimately reach the end of his extremely long life. After an emotional farewell to his sons, Odin finally went to Valhalla. His spirit, however, would remain with Thor and all Asgardians to import wisdom and help them on their future journeys.

Biography
King of Asgard
Conquering the Nine Realms
Odin was the son of Bor, the second king of Asgard. He had many brothers, who all perished during the Asgardians' many wars. Bor ultimately died in battle as well, Odin ascending to the throne as king of Asgard and peacekeeper within the Nine Realms. In an effort to prevent the prophecy of Ragnarök from taking place, Odin defeated the Fire Demon Surtur, taking the Eternal Flame, the source of his power, back to Asgard with him and banishing Surtur in the realm of Muspelheim, where he remained for thousands of years.

As Allfather, Odin battled great beasts, invaded other realms, destroyed demons and monsters, devastated whole worlds, and laid waste to mighty kingdoms. To maintain his immense power, Odin required a prolonged period of time to rest and regain his strength. This deep sleep became known as the Odinsleep.

Odin eventually had a daughter named Hela, whom he chose to be his Executioner and Commander of the Einherjar, Asgard's army. Together, they conquered the Nine Realms, forging Asgard into a mighty empire.

Banishing Hela
Odin and Hela charge into battle together
Hela's ambitions eventually grew too great for Odin's liking, as he realized that peace, not war, was the only way to maintain order within the Realms. Hela refused to back down, however, and attempted to take the throne from her father by force. Odin and Hela fought, Odin emerging as the victor.

Odin and Hela rule over all the Nine Realms
Odin by now had realized that Hela was a central part of the prophecy of Ragnarök and destined to be killed by Surtur, the Fire Demon he had battled and weakened long ago. Unwilling to seal Asgard's fate with his daughter's life, Odin instead banished Hela to the barren wastes of Hel, binding his lifeforce to her prison to ensure Hela remained imprisoned for as long as he lived.

Massacre of the Valkyrie
When Hela tried to break from her prison, Odin sent his legendary female warriors, the Valkyrie, to stop her. When Odin realized that the Valkyrie had been defeated and killed by his daughter, Odin personally entered Hel, once again emerging victorious over Hela, and re-imprisoned her. However, unknown to him, Brunnhilde, the leader of the Valkyrie, survived, but wanted nothing to do with Odin after the death of her fellow Warriors.

Ushering a New Peace
Odin's original rule over Asgard
To make sure Hela's impact on the Nine Realms was forgotten, Odin wiped her out of history and had several other murals installed in his palace, depicting a false history where Asgard reaches its status and glory through peace treaties and amiable meetings with other realms. Desiring to be benevolent, Odin chose to rely solely on peace to bring about a new state of stability and order in the Nine Realms.

Odin's eventual new rule as a benevolent king
Eventually, Odin felt that the burden of wearing the crown was too much for him alone and married Frigga, because she was a strong partner and had a helpful ear. Odin and Frigga had a child together, a boy they named Thor. With the birth of Thor, Odin felt that one day he would be able to pass his crown to a worthy successor. Odin's efforts at benevolence were crowned with success, bringing a period of stability that he would later refer to as the "Great Beginning".

Asgard-Jotunheim War
War with the Frost Giants
Odin fights against the Frost Giants' armies
In 965 A.D., King Laufey of Jotunheim invaded Midgard, intending to enslave the humans and to place the planet into a new Ice Age, replacing their own dying world. Odin led his Asgardian army against Laufey and his horde of Frost Giants in the Asgard-Jotunheim War.

Odin defeats Laufey and ends the war
During the furious Battle of Tønsberg, Odin lost one of his eyes, but eventually, the Asgardians came out victorious over the Frost Giants, with Odin defeating Laufey in single combat on top of a temple within Jotunheim. In exchange for his life, Laufey agreed to a peace treaty between Asgard and Jotunheim which would last for over a thousand years. After the battle, Odin's forces took the Casket of Ancient Winters from one of Laufey's temples, ensuring that the Frost Giants could never attack any other worlds ever again.

Odin finds and adopts the infant Loki
While exploring the depths of the Jotun temple, Odin discovered an infant Frost Giant, Loki, who was the son of Laufey. Loki was left to die by his cruel father because of his small stature. Odin and his wife, Frigga, already had a son, Thor, but they adopted Loki as Thor's brother, using sorcery to change his appearance to that of an Asgardian, and kept the truth of Loki's birth from both of them. Odin believed that a Frost Giant living as a prince of Asgard could help bring about a permanent peace between the two realms.

A King and A Father
Odin explains the responsibility of being king
Odin raised both Thor and Loki as brothers, attempting to never allow Loki to feel any different from his brother or allow him to know his true Frost Giant nature. He taught them about the responsibilities of being king of Asgard, the history of Asgard's great wars, and other lessons about maintaining the peace should they take the throne.

Odin raises both Thor and Loki together
Odin answered their questions happily and showed them both great love and care. Loki showed Odin many times that he would be a capable king; however, Odin had long since decided that Thor would be his heir, though he still told Loki he had what it took to become king. As they grew older, Odin gave Thor the mighty hammer Mjølnir to use as his weapon of war, while Frigga taught magic to Loki, giving them each their own power to protect the Nine Realms.

Bringing the Tesseract to Earth
Odin brought Thor and Loki on a visit to Earth. The Asgardians taught the Norse people their language and culture and displayed their abilities; this caused the Norse people to believe the Asgardians to be deities, and bestowed upon Thor the moniker "God of Thunder." This tradition was continued for many years. During one of these visits, Odin brought the Tesseract from his vault and brought it to Tønsberg, Norway, where he left it in the care of devout Asgardian worshipers.

Loki's Schemes
Thor's Delayed Coronation
Odin attending Thor's royal coronation
Many years later, Odin decided to retire as King of Asgard, intending to make Thor King in his place. In the Great Hall, Odin prepared to crown Thor as he watched his son confidently stroll through the cheering crowd with Mjølnir, while Frigga stood by Odin's side with Loki, Lady Sif, and the Warriors Three.

Odin greeted Thor and explained the responsibilities of king and protector of the Nine Realms, asking Thor if he swore to defend these all people throughout the galaxy. While Odin speaks, Frost Giants enter Asgard in an attempt to retrieve the Casket of Ancient Winters from Odin's Vault. Sensing the attack, Odin released the Destroyer, which quickly obliterated the intruding Frost Giants. 

Thor, Odin, and Loki after the attack
Odin, Thor, and Loki traveled to Odin's Vault and found the remains of the Frost Giants and the Einherjar Guards. Thor was angered by the slaughter, demanding Odin travel to Jotunheim to retaliate for the attack. Odin, however, insisted that the peace with Laufey was still in effect and the attack was not an act of war, but an act of a few Frost Giant rebels doomed to fail, and they should continue to act as though their peace treaty is still in effect.

Odin decides not to allow Thor to be king yet
Seeing Thor's rage and war-hungry ways, Odin chooses not to name him King yet, fearing his uncontrollable rage would cause another war with Jotunheim, causing the deaths of thousands across the Nine Realms. Despite Odin's clear orders, Thor remained furious by this attack, and with his friends, Lady Sif, the Warriors Three, and Loki, he went to Jotunheim to personally confront King Laufey and the Frost Giants to find answers he sought about the attack.

Banishing Thor
Odin saves Thor's allies on Jotunheim
When Odin was warned of his son's actions by a Einherjar guard, he charged forward to Heimdall and used the Bifrost Bridge to rescue Thor and his friends from Jotunheim riding aboard Sleipnir, his eight-legged steed, after Thor went there seeking answers regarding the intrusion. He soon found them in the middle of a fierce battle with a Frost Beast and the Frost Giants' entire army.

Odin tries and fails to make peace with Laufey
Although Thor cheered at his arrival and suggested that together they destroy the Frost Giants, Odin furiously ordered his son to be silent. Odin tried in vain to rebuild the peace between Asgard and Jotunheim, but Laufey would have none of it, and declared war between their worlds, which Odin had no choice but to accept. Laufey tried to stab Odin in the back, but Odin was able to use Gungnir to throw Laufey away and escape with his allies.

Odin confronts Thor about his actions
Returning to Asgard Odin ordered Lady Sif and the Warriors Three to take Fandral to the healing room to treat the injuries he had sustained during the battle. Furious at what had happened and what had now begun, Odin berated Thor for his arrogance and stupidity in starting a new war with one of his greatest enemies, putting millions of innocent lives in harm's way, while Thor claimed that their enemies should fear him and the other Nine Realms were laughing at their inaction. He told Thor he was not unworthy of his title and of his family, only for Thor to yell back that his father was nothing more than an old man and a fool for not taking any action against Laufey.

Odin taking Thor's power and banishing him
Seeing no alternative, Odin decided that the only possible chance for peace was the banishment of his own son. As he began insulting and degrading his son, Loki tried to step in, but Odin ordered him to be silent. He then stripped Thor of his powers and in the name of his father Bor and Bor's father before him, banished Thor to Earth for his arrogance. He placed an enchantment on Mjølnir that allowed only the worthy to wield it. He then sent Mjølnir to Earth as well.

Telling Loki the Truth
Odin tells Loki the truth about his birth
Loki, witnessing his hand turning blue when he was at Jotunheim, decided to confirm his fears by breaking into Odin's Vault touching the Casket of Ancient Winters. Odin discovered his adopted son who confronted Odin about his true origins, having turned blue upon touching the casket. Odin revealed that he not only stole the Casket, but Laufey's son who was left there to die.

Odin collapses and falls into the Odinsleep
As he took in this news, Loki demanded to know Odin's reasons for such a deception, Odin revealed that he wanted to gain a permanent peace between Asgard and Jotunheim by having Loki rule the world of the Frost Giants. Loki was disgusted by his own parentage and claimed that Odin could have never loved him the same way he loved Thor and would have never given him the throne. Overwhelmed by Loki's furious accusations, he fell into the Odinsleep.

Losing Loki
Loki and Frigga with Odin in his Odinsleep
While he slumbered, Loki took the throne for himself. Frigga spent much of her time sitting by his bedside, waiting for him to awaken. While living on Earth, Thor proved himself worthy and regained his powers while fighting the Destroyer as Loki carried out his plans to destroy Jotunheim by allowing Laufey to enter into Asgard before killing him, preventing Laufey from stabbing the sleeping Odin, while presenting Loki as the apparent saviour of the King of Asgard.

Odin manages to save both Thor and Loki
The two brothers battled as Loki attempted to destroy Jotunheim while Thor tried to stop such a genocide and eventually caused the destruction of the Bifrost Bridge. As they were falling off the bridge, Odin, awoken from his Odinsleep by the dangers his sons were in, grabbed Thor's leg just before he fell into the black hole below. As they hung on the edge of the world, Loki desperately tried to explain to Odin that he did everything for his beloved family.

Odin watches Loki fall into a black hole
Odin could not accept Loki's ideals and simply told him no. Loki, devastated by the rejection, let go on Gungnir and allowed himself to fall into the deep and dark abyss created in the wake of the Bifrost Bridge's destruction. While Thor screamed out in mourning agony, Odin watched on helplessly as his adopted son fell to his presumed death. Odin then ensured that Thor was safe while the Frost Giants reacted to their near extermination at Loki's hands.

Odin speaks to Thor about being king
With the threat of the Frost Giants now at an end, Asgard then had a mighty feast, to celebrate the end of the war and the return of Thor. Odin, however, did not attend, instead he looked out into the nine realms, mourning his lost son. Thor joined his father and told him that he now understood why he had been banished and knew he still had much to learn. Odin told Thor that he had already made him very proud and he would make a fine leader someday.

Odin offers Thor some calm and vital advice
As a group of rag-tag invaders called the Marauders started to attack several of the Nine Realms, at the same time, Frigga discovered that Loki was alive and that he intended to conquer Earth. Odin sent Thor to retrieve Loki using his dark Magic, at the cost of his own and Thor's health. However, there was an amount of time for Thor to get back onto Asgard with Loki. Odin watched Thor's confrontation with Loki through the eyes of Hugin and Munin.

War of the Realms
The Trial of Loki
Odin orders Loki to be locked away
When Thor returned to Asgard with the now captured Loki and the Tesseract, Odin decided to speak with the prisoner. Though Loki tried to justify his actions on Earth claiming that it was his birthright to be a king, Odin openly told him that he would spare his life only because of Frigga's love for him. Odin then condemned Loki to an eternal imprisonment inside the Asgardian Dungeons.

End of the War
Odin overlooks the peace within Asgard
Approximately a year after Thor helped the mortals in saving Earth from Loki and his army of the Chitauri, the Marauders were still pillaging the peaceful inhabitants of the Nine Realms, and Odin had to send Thor to lead the armies of Asgard against them. During a final battle on Vanaheim, Thor along with Lady Sif and the Warriors Three managed to defeat the Marauders and force them to surrender.

Thor seeks out Odin's help and council
Once Thor had returned from the Battle of Vanaheim, they discussed the newly secured peace across the Nine Realms as Odin thanked his son for everything he had done. Odin then discussed a pressing matter with his son; his infatuation with Jane Foster, recommending that Thor instead seek a romantic relationship with an Asgardian rather than a human, suggesting Lady Sif for Thor's affections as she clearly had strong feelings for him. Knowing that Thor would not listen, Odin suggested that he at least try to enjoy his victory over the Marauders by joining Fandral and Volstagg for celebrations in an Asgardian bar while having drinks with the people of Asgard.

Return of the Dark Elves
Odin introduces himself to Jane Foster
Thor eventually brought Jane Foster into Asgard, much to Odin's disapproval. Odin stormed into the room as Eir was conducting tests on a strange illness that had befallen Foster and demanded that she return to Midgard. However, when it was discovered that Foster was carrying the Aether within her veins, Odin was mortified and decided to keep her protected within the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf.

Odin tells Thor and Foster about the Aether
Odin showed Thor and Foster the Book of Yggdrasil and explained the history of the Dark Elves, a race of creatures that was believed to be extinct for thousands of years ever since Odin's father King Bor defeated them during the First Battle of Svartalfheim. However, Odin knew that as the Aether had finally been found, the army of the Dark Elves, led by Malekith the Accursed would return seeking to finally reclaim their most powerful weapon once again.

Sacking of Asgard
Odin speaks to Frigga for the final time
When the Dark Elves attacked against Asgard by sending in their Dark Elf Harrows to attack Asgard's defenses, Odin led a troop to put down the rebellion in the Asgardian Dungeons led by Kurse. Along the way, he came across Frigga and Jane Foster; he assured Frigga that there was nothing to fear and smiled as she showed her fear for his safety. Odin said that even after he had survived so many previous battles, his wife still worries for him; she reminded him that it was due to her worrying that he had survived for so long.

Odin witnesses the attack of the Dark Elves
When Odin, Lady Sif and their squad of Einherjar soldiers returned to the upper chambers, they discovered that the army of Dark Elves had successfully invaded the palace and killed dozens of the Asgardian soldiers and destroyed Odin's own throne with a Black Hole Grenade. Once Odin had dispatched one fleeing Dark Elf with a single powerful blast from Gungnir, Odin realized that the Dark Elves would likely attack Frigga to get to Foster and steal the Aether.

Odin discovers Frigga's lifeless body
Odin quickly went to their aid but was too late, and discovered that his beloved wife Frigga had been murdered by Malekith and Kurse while protecting Foster with her magic. Although also Thor arrived, he was unable to kill the Dark Elf leader, instead severely burning his face with a powerful blast from Mjølnir. Upon discovering her body, Odin fell to his knees and cradled his beloved wife, devastated by the loss of the woman he truly loved so dearly while Thor looked on.

Odin attends Frigga's funeral
Odin arranged for a ceremonial funeral for Frigga and the soldiers who died in the attack. Odin wore an all black armor and oversaw the ceremony where his wife's body was placed into a ship and transformed into glittering mist resembling stars in the universe. Odin remained silent during the ceremony, silently mourning his beloved wife. Every resident of Asgard, including Heimdall and Lady Sif, showed their respect for their queen and the soldiers.

Seeking Revenge
Odin vows to destroy Malekith and his army
Desiring to destroy the Dark Elves once and for all, Odin met with Fandral and Volstagg to discuss military plans only to learn that they were almost completely defenceless against this threat. Interrupting the meeting, Thor tried to convince his father to allow him leave Asgard with Jane Foster and draw Malekith away, but Odin declined, stating that he was powerful enough to defeat Malekith himself, and insisted they simply wait. Odin said he was willing to sacrifice every soldier needed to avenge Frigga and defeat Malekith.

Odin learns Heimdall has helped Thor escape
Thor defied Odin's own orders and enlisted Heimdall, Lady Sif and the Warriors Three in helping him, Foster and Loki escape Asgard with the intention of using the Aether to draw Malekith into the open and destroy him and his weapon. Heimdall then sent for Odin and confessed his disobedience. A slightly surprised Odin simply ordered his guards to stop Thor, who was escaping on a Dark Elf Harrow, by any means, but they were too late and quickly lost him.

Odin learns of Loki's apparent death
With Thor now gone with Foster and Loki, Odin sent his Einherjar Guard to Svartalfheim to check on the battle against Malekith. When the guard returned, he approached Odin with news that they had discovered Loki's body. The guard, however, was actually Loki in a disguise. Some time later, the throne of Asgard was usurped by Loki who had disguised himself as the Allfather, allowing himself to rule Asgard as he had desired and send Thor to Earth.

Deception
Banished to Earth
The appearance of Odin was used by Loki to rule the Asgardians for some time after Loki's faked death on Svartalfheim. While ruling Asgard as Odin, Loki cast a spell on his father and exiled him to Earth, leaving him dazed at Shady Acres Care Home: a retirement home in New York City. Some time after Odin was left on Earth, his retirement home was destroyed and he eventually overcame Loki's strong enchantment. Doctor Strange contacted Odin during this time, however, Odin chose to stay on Earth instead of returning to Asgard. He subsequently traveled the Earth and enjoyed his time.

Search for Odin
When Thor exposed Loki's deceptive rule to the people of Asgard, Thor ensured his brother would aid him in his quest of finding their father. However, Shady Acres Care Home was bulldozed and destroyed, upon arrival. Doctor Strange, having detected the presence of Asgardians in his city, stepped in and volunteered to help Thor find his father on the condition that Loki leaves Earth thereafter. With the aid of several tomes within the New York Sanctum, Doctor Strange used Thor's hair to mystically pinpoint Odin's location and create a portal to Odin in Norway.

Death
Odin sits down with Thor and Loki
When his sons found him, Odin was nearing the end of his long life. He commented that Norway was beautiful and revealed it took him a while to break Loki's spell over him, noting that Frigga should be proud of him. He revealed that he could feel his time coming to an end by saying that his wife was calling out to him. When Thor insisted to take him back to Asgard, Odin instead took to resting on a rock.

Odin peacefully dies
Before dying, Odin lamented that Ragnarök would come and he revealed the existence of Hela, his oldest child and only daughter, warning Thor and Loki that Hela would be released once he died. Telling his sons he loved them, Odin finally died and his spirit ascended to Valhalla. Upon his death, Hela was finally freed from her banishment.

Legacy
Odin appearing in Thor's vision
Thor was devastated by his father's death and mourned him when he was imprisoned in Sakaar. Even Loki was also saddened and showed remorse for his death. However, Hela rejoiced at his demise, commenting that she would have loved to see it. While Odin failed to prevent Ragnarök, his spirit continued to aid Thor as he traveled to stop Hela, sending visions from Valhalla. Thor's first vision of Odin allowed him to quickly gain the upper hand over Hulk and this allowed him to survive the Tournament, the only person to have ever done it, although he did not win thanks to the Grandmaster interfering. Thor saw his father one more time when he was being easily defeated by Hela and had lost his eye in the process.

Odin leaving Thor after giving guidance
When seeing Odin, Thor desperately admitted that he could not defeat Hela without his hammer, which she destroyed, and that he is not as powerful as Odin was. The Allfather encouraged Thor by reminding him that he is not the God of Hammers and Mjølnir was only ever a focus to his powers as well as revealing Thor was actually even stronger than him.

Odin telling Thor that he is stronger than him
This vision allowed Thor to fight back against Hela alongside Valkyrie long enough for Loki to revive Surtur and destroy both Hela, and Asgard itself. Odin had said himself that Asgard was not a location, but wherever their people are was truly Asgard, thus Ragnarök being more of a Rebirth for the Asgardians than their doom.

Personality
Odin was a patient, just, and wise king. He strived to maintain the peace between the Nine Realms and was thoughtful of the lives of the innocent. Despite his enemies warring against him and his willingness to cause mass destruction when needed, he was compassionate enough to not seek the obliteration of the innocents of the opposing force. He even adopted Loki, the abandoned son of his old foe Laufey, and raised and loved him as his own son, although he initially did this as a way to unite Asgard and Jotunheim. Nevertheless, Odin was firm in his rule and did not hesitate to mete out justice on those who threaten the peace, even if those individuals were his own children.

Odin was considered to be the wisest king in Asgard's history, admired by all for his leadership, and was thus an exceptional leader. He had effectively led the Einherjar into victory in countless wars over all the Nine Realms. His skills allowed him to conquer the Nine Realms when he sought to conquer all the Realms. However, after realizing peace would be the only way to truly unite the Realms, Odin became the benevolent, peace-loving, nearly all-powerful and all-knowing ruler of Asgard and the guardian of the Nine Realms. As such, he was wise and honorable. He was dedicated to using his power for keeping the peace between the Nine Realms. He believed in being responsible (in terms of being careful and responsible for one's actions), duty (in terms of the protection of and keeping the peace between the Nine Realms), and honor (always being a man of his word). However, when angered or upset, he could be very stern to the point of ruthlessness when necessary. As Frigga stated, "everything he does, he does with a purpose." He loved Thor but when Thor went to Jotunheim and nearly started a war in the process, he exiled Thor to Earth, to teach him what it meant to a good warrior and a hero, as well as to bolster his humility.

While he was a good king who cares about the peace of the realms, the ghosts of his past self and his initial anger that once controlled him can show, as he was willing to sacrifice as many Asgardians as necessary if Malekith had attacked again, showing to be just as ruthless as Malekith at the time, as Thor noted, due to the intense grief, rage, and need for revenge coursing through him after Frigga's death. Even when Thor asked what would make Odin different from Malekith, Odin merely laughed and said the difference was that he would win. It was from this that Thor realized that Odin, due to his lust for vengeance, was not thinking straight and under his rule, Malekith would be able to destroy Asgard.

In his youth, Odin was a ruthless war king who had no qualms violently conquering the Nine Realms with his daughter, Hela. After conquering the Nine Realms, Odin underwent a change upon realizing that only through peace can the Nine Realms truly be united and desisted with further conquest. He then made a transition both societal and personal, shifting from a ruler of a war-seeking realm into the wise and benevolent king his sons grew up knowing. Hela was not able to make this transition, which resulted in a conflict that ended with her exile and imprisonment.

Odin was also criticized by all three of his children and Brunnhilde on how he dealt with his problems and past mistakes, most often through secrecy, lies, or by covering them up. He hid the original mural depicting his bloody history and conquests with Hela by covering it with a mural that showed him and his family uniting the realms through peaceful methods, and even erased his daughter from Asgardian history. He had never revealed to Loki his heritage, hoping that by hiding it, his adopted son wouldn't feel disparate from his family. Though he loved and respected him, Thor openly admitted his father's faults to others, even commenting that Hela had the right to be angry at him. Odin later showed remorse and regret for how he handled his mistakes and problems in his last moments, implying his exile made him realize had he not used secrets and lies, things would not have escalated to Ragnarök.

In his exile, Odin apparently thought over all the acts he had done and likely felt remorse over them, as he showed no hostility towards Loki and even noted Frigga would be proud of him. He also admitted that he truly loved both of his sons and expressed remorse for failing to stop Ragnarök. He had made peace with his fate and died peacefully while in the company of his sons, apparently content he would be reunited with Frigga in the afterlife and leave Thor as the new King of Asgard. His spirit was much kinder and less strict to Thor, as when Hulk pummelled Thor, instead of being angry and strictly asking him to get up, Odin simply serenely smiled at his son and later openly encouraged Thor that he was stronger than him.

As with all Asgardians, Odin possessed superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, durability, and was extremely long-lived. However, as the King of Asgard, these attributes were significantly superior to those possessed by the other members of his race.

Asgardian Physiology: As the king of the Asgardians, Odin had immense superhuman abilities and powers that far surpassed almost all other Asgardians, even his son Thor, who openly acknowledged Odin's powers as being superior to his. Odin's powers were even superior to that of Hela, the Goddess of Death and his first-born, as he was able to defeat and imprison his only daughter in Hel, defeated and grievously wounded a fully empowered Surtur and took away his Eternal Flame, which left Surtur in a battered, limping and weakened state for five thousand years. Odin's immeasurable levels of power made him the most powerful Asgardian and among the most powerful beings in the Nine Realms and the cosmos. His powers were so great that even Hela held it in a high regard and openly claimed that he always remained unchallenged in his conquest and had the power needed to conquer the cosmos.
Superhuman Strength: As the King of Asgard, Odin possessed immeasurable levels of superhuman strength, making him the strongest Asgardian, far stronger than average Asgardians and holding far superior strength to his son Thor and even was stronger than Hela, allowing Odin to overpower and imprison her in Hel twice. Odin also managed to overwhelm the Fire Demon Surtur while the latter was fully empowered by the Eternal Flame and deemed as one of the most powerful beings on the Nine Realms and in the cosmos as well, and confined him to his realm Muspelheim. When he was younger, he was able to battle multiple Frost Giants on his own and lift one with his spear Gungnir, even using it to overpower their ruler, Laufey. He was also able to catch and hold onto both of his sons Thor and Loki when they were sent flying off the edge of the Bifrost and effortlessly rip off pieces of Thor's armor, despite his advanced age.
Superhuman Durability: As the King of Asgard, Odin possessed immeasurable levels of superhuman durability, making him the most durable Asgardian, far stronger than average Asgardians and holding far superior durability to his son Thor and even his first born, Hela.
Superhuman Speed: Odin can move and run faster than a normal human.
Superhuman Agility: Odin naturally possessed greater agility, dexterity, balance, and body coordination than that of a normal human being.
Superhuman Stamina: Like all Asgardians, Odin's musculature produced considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of humans.
Superhuman Reflexes: Odin could react and dodge objects traveling at high speeds.
Regenerative Healing Factor: Despite his body's resistance, Odin could be injured like any other Asgardian. However, his metabolism enabled him to rapidly regenerate damaged bodily tissue with greater speed and efficiency than a human being is capable of. He wasn't able to grow back missing organs though, as he lost his right eye during the Asgard-Jotunheim War and it had not been healed back since.
Longevity: Like all Asgardians, Odin aged at a rate that is much slower than that of a human being. Even though he was thousands of years old, he was still in very good health, greatly belying his appearance. When he died, he was over 5,000 years old if not older.

Odinforce Manipulation: Odin was capable of generating and skillfully manipulating his own life force's magical and cosmic energy for a number of powerful effects, such as warping reality. His power allowed him to effortlessly strip Thor of his own powers and made him mortal, causing his Asgardian armor to dissolve off his body. He also was one of the only two Asgardians who had access to dark magic, which allowed him to effortlessly tap into an esoteric energy capable of summoning the Bifrost to transport others through the universe without needing to use the Rainbow Bridge, as shown when he was able to channel a great amount of dark energy to send Thor to Earth when the Bifrost was still destroyed. Odin is also capable of placing multiple permanent enchantments on items, as he did for Mjølnir when he exiled Thor to Earth, while beforehand he was able to summon Mjølnir from Thor to his own hand and use it to unleash a powerful beam of golden light capable of destroying the remains of Thor's armor and blasting him through the Bifrost Bridge to Earth. His power of enchantments allowed him to change the appearance of Loki into that of an Asgardian when the latter was a baby, presumably by giving some Asgardian energy to him, which seemingly enhanced Loki's physical powers, though the spell could be briefly seen through when Loki was in contact with the ice power of the Frost Giants and the Casket of Ancient Winters, as well as to enhance Mjølnir to make it able to allow Thor to easily harness his innate supernatural powers until he had fully mastered them. Whilst channeling the Odinforce through Gungnir, Odin is capable of projecting powerful energy blasts that enabled him to destroy millions of Frost Giants and Dark Elves effortlessly. He is especially skilled in using his power during combat situations, and was able to casually destroy his opponents with ease during the war with the Frost Giants. When it was still active, Odin had a mental connection to the Destroyer through Gungnir, allowing him to remotely command it and use its senses to perceive what transpired around it. The weapon was also used in a funeral ceremony for those who had fallen during the Sacking of Asgard, with Odin slammed Gungnir on the ground, causing the bodies of the dead to transform into a glittering mist that flew up into the night sky. He also was able to use the Odinforce to bind Hela in Hel with his life serving as the lock to her prison. His mystical power also allowed him to transcend death and exist as a spirit, allowing Thor to have visions of his father and communicate with him after he had died and his body dispersed into energy.
Abilities
Genius-level Intellect: As King of Asgard and recognized in mythology as the God of War and Wisdom, Odin possessed vast knowledge of ancient and arcane wisdom, considered to be his most powerful weapon.
Master Tactician: Odin's thousands of years of experience resulted in him becoming a master tactician. His tactical abilities were shown by the fact that he had led Asgard's army, the Einherjar, to victory in countless battles.
Odin battling against the Frost Giants
Master Combatant: Odin was an exceptionally proficient warrior, in both armed and hand-to-hand combat, and was known as the greatest warrior of the Nine Realms of his time. At his prime, he was capable of defeating beings as formidably powerful as Hela, his first-born and executioner, something that not even the combined might of all the Valkyries and Thor, even after gaining full power and aided by Brunnhilde, could not do, imprisoning his daughter in Hel, and even Surtur at full power, grievously wounding him to the point that he remained in a limping, weakened state for thousands of years. During Asgard's war with the Frost Giants, Odin effortlessly killed multiple of the race with relative ease and ultimately ended the war when he defeated their leader, Laufey, in single combat.
Spear Mastery: Odin is highly proficient in Spears, especially his Gungnir. He was able to use it against Frost Giants with great efficiently and defeat Frost Giants.
Bilingualism: Odin was fluent in speaking and understanding Asgardian and English.

Behind the Scenes
Odin was portrayed by Anthony Hopkins in Thor. Hopkins reprised his role in Thor: The Dark World. Tom Kane voiced Odin in the video game Thor: God of Thunder, as did Scott Rayow in Thor: The Dark World - The Official Game.
With the whereabouts of Odin at the end of Thor: The Dark World unconfirmed, Anthony Hopkins expressed disinterest to return to the franchise while both he and Alan Taylor confirmed he was dead as a twist for the end. Kevin Feige however said "like all of our plans at Marvel Studios, we know where we would like to go if given the opportunity. We have very good ideas whether the Allfather is with us or not", giving the possibility of his return. Hopkins later reprised the role in Thor: Ragnarok.
Mel Gibson was offered the part of Odin, but turned it down.
Raliegh Wilson and Brian J. Williams were stunt doubles for Anthony Hopkins in the role of Odin.
