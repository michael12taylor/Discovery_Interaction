<html><p>Lang with Hope van Dyne and Cassie Lang
Afterwards, Lang and Hope returned to Maggie Lang's House and spent some quality time with his daughter. The three sat outside on the front steps together while watching the fireworks going off to celebrate the return of people in the Blip.

Lang attends Tony Stark's funeral
A week later, Lang attended Tony Stark’s funeral with Hope and her restored parents, Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne at Stark's home. The four stood together, along with several other heroes and allies, as they watched Pepper Potts and her daughter put Stark's Arc Reactor in the lake.

Personality
Scott Lang is an affable rogue with tongue-in-cheek humor. Despite his criminal activity, Lang is a man of honor, good morals, and justice, though to the point of being stubborn, with it being his sense of honor that had led him to his break-in at Vistacorp, where Lang avenged all the people the corrupt corporation wronged. Lang's desire to right wrongs was often the motivation for his illegal activities, yet his love for his daughter, Cassie, also made him determined to go straight upon his release from San Quentin State Prison. Lang only went back to criminal activities when his criminal record ostracized him and gave him no other choice in supporting his daughter. Lang will "do the wrong thing for the right reason", which is why he joined Captain America's team during the Avengers Civil War, seeing Rogers' point of view on the Sokovia Accords far more just and honorable than Tony Stark's.

Lang also had the drive to prove himself worthy, as he felt he didn't deserve the admiration of his daughter Cassie. In fact, Lang was initially unwilling to take up the mantle of Ant-Man from Hank Pym due to his own fears of having used the suit. But upon a chat with the former hero, Lang realized he had a chance to become the hero that his daughter already thought he was.

Despite being a thief, Lang is a big fan of the Avengers, admiring their heroism deeply. Although he shared the same dislike of Tony Stark as his mentor, Lang was quick to request they ask the Avengers for help to deal with Darren Cross. Rather than trying to fight Falcon, a member of the Avengers, immediately, Lang tried to reason with him, attempting to no avail to appeal to the Avenger's desire to protect the world, and apologized for having to fight and harm him. He is a particular fan of Captain America, calling it an honor to meet him and was awestruck towards Rogers, shaking his hand for too long and babbled before Rogers brought him back to reality. Lang's respect for Rogers was so great that he allowed him and Bucky Barnes to escape by creating a distraction which he implied could have killed him, and knowing that even if he survived he would've been captured. In addition, although Black Widow was his enemy during the conflict, Lang showed reluctance and regret that he would have to fight her.

Lang also had a considerable dislike towards Tony Stark and the latter's attitude. This was highlighted when he was interviewed on WHiH World News, as when Christine Everhart said he that he was "no Tony Stark", Lang was relieved at the news, genuinely desiring to be nothing like Stark. This was highlighted once again during the Avengers Civil War. Prior to the Clash of the Avengers, he reacted with alarm and distrust to Stark's name. Lang also takes great pleasure in mocking Stark and battling against him; whilst shrunken down during the Civil War, he started disabling Stark's Mark XLVI Armor from the inside and implied he didn't have a conscience despite the fact that not saying anything may have allowed Lang to do more damage without being detected. When he was later imprisoned in the Raft, he again mocked Stark to his face saying that Pym was right not to trust Stark's family. The fact that Stark asked him who he is was a severe blow to Lang's ego. However, after Lang escaped the Quantum Realm by sheer happenstance five years after the Snap, he sought out Stark's help in reversing it and worked with him as his partner during the Time Heist, appearing to let go of his grudge against him. After Stark sacrificed himself to defeat Thanos, Lang attended his funeral with a somber look.

Since being put under house arrest after escaping the Raft, Lang had time to prioritize what was important in his life. He respected Hank Pym enough to hide the Ant-Man Suit instead of destroying it; he also refused to attempt contacting them as by using the Pym Particles in the Avengers Civil War, it put him on the Most Wanted list. Lang learned Up Close Magic and set up imaginary heists and getaways throughout his apartment as entertainment for his daughter. He also used his former thief skills to set up X-Con Security Consultants with Luis and the rest of his buddies, now creating security systems instead of bypassing them. Lang retained a romantic interest in Hope, a woman who he respected for both her intelligence and fighting skills; as Lang put it, if he was going to have a partner, there was no one else he would want but Hope (professionally and romantically).

Powers and Abilities
Ant-Man Suit Capabilities
Lang shrinking down into small size
Size Manipulation: Using technology developed by Hank Pym, Lang is able to reduce himself to approximately the size of an ant, though he can also grow his body to gigantic sizes, doing the latter, however, puts an enormous strain on him. He still maintains his regular-sized strength and resilience when shrinking; while in reduced scale, this translates to granting him inhuman effort and exertion capabilities. Also, obtaining momentum and kinetic energy in small scale and exerting it immediately while returning to or right after returning to normal size can result in a feat of superhuman effort and exertion, and therefore, momentarily give Lang enhanced strength while in regular size, enough to send a man flying while attacking and enlarging himself at the same time. The process of altering size compresses force and energy, manifesting as brief shockwaves of vibration around the target that charge the target with momentum. Lang cannot maintain himself giant for extended periods time, as it causes some heavy stress on his body and if done long enough he can even faint. However, Lang seemed to be getting used to it the more times he does it, and instead of fainting he only gets very exhausted; by the time of Battle of Earth, Lang remained most of the conflict in giant form without fainting, exhausting, or showing any major drawback.

Ant-Man punching a Leviathan down
Superhuman Strength: While wearing the Ant-Man Suit in its miniature form, Lang possesses superhuman strength due to his increased density, effort, and exertion, enabling him to take out multiple opponents of normal human size while shrunk and use the physical force and momentum attained from changing size to simulate superhuman strength directly after returning to normal size. This strength also extends to legs, allowing him to jump, spring and leap across with great force, allowing him to move through the air like a bullet to strike and impact opponents and incapacitate them instantly or move halfway across a room in a single bound. However, exerting too much force into impacts and physical attacks can accidentally kill an opponent, due to the force of attacks being comparable to that of a bullet. The process of altering size compresses force and energy, manifesting as brief shockwaves of vibration around Lang that charge the target with enough momentum that can briefly enhance the target's strength while enlarging or immediately after enlarging. In his enlarged form, Lang's strength enabled him to crush huge vehicles, stomp on Cull Obsidian, tear a passenger plane apart, and punch a Leviathan into the ground. While having an enormous mass, Lang's side effects come at a cost of his speed and balance, causing him great exhaustion, but this drawback seems to have faded after having spent five years in the Quantum Realm.
Ant-Man taking missiles from War Machine
Superhuman Durability: While wearing the Ant-Man Suit in its miniature form, Lang's increased density also affords him superhuman durability, retaining the resilience of a human of regular size. This notably allows him to withstand impacts that would easily stun or even kill a normal human, enough to him to fall from great heights and crash onto a surface with the force of a bullet, leaving a bullet hole like a crater in the surface while he remained unharmed. When he has increased his size into a giant-sized man, he naturally becomes far tougher and more durable than normal. This is due to his increased density and muscle mass, and it was enough to withstand missiles from War Machine. However, this enormous amount of durability comes at the cost of his speed and balance, making his movements somewhat clumsy as a result.
Insect Manipulation:     Lang befriending a fellow ant companion   Lang, through the use of the EMP Communication Device within the suit's helmet and the earpieces given to him by Hank Pym, can affect the pheromones of insect-sized organisms and stimulate their olfactory nerve centers, allowing him a rudimentary form of control over ants. He can direct their actions and behavior at will to cause them to work together, such as by forming themselves into bridges or walkways, allowing themselves to be used as mounts, or attacking a target, usually in swarms as a distraction for the user.

Abilities
Gifted Intellect: Lang possesses above average intelligence, as he was able to figure out how to use the highly complex Ant-Man Suit and gain a Master's Degree in electrical engineering, along with bypassing the security of Hank Pym's home. He also has quite a good understanding of chemistry which allowed him to destroy Hank Pym's safe.
Expert Engineer: Lang was an electrical engineer, having earned a Master's Degree in the subject. He was formerly employed by Vistacorp as one of the chief engineers. His knowledge was useful when he was able to tinker a way out of the Quantum Realm using tech pieces provided by Hank Pym.
Expert Thief: Lang was highly trained in theft, specializing in breaking into homes or facilities and other places to steal, even some of the most advanced facilities in the world like Vistacorp Headquarters, New Avengers Facility and Pym Technologies Headquarters. He has shown to break into Vistacorp Headquarters, Geoff Zorick's Mansion, Pym Residence, New Avengers Facility, Pym Technologies Headquarters, Berkeley University, Brookemont Elementary School and Ghost's Hideout. He is also highly skilled in utilizing chemistry when opening locked safes and bypassing security systems.
Expert Hacker: As one of the chief engineers of Vistacorp, an international cybersecurity and data storage conglomerate, Lang possessed a large amount computer programming and hacking skills. Lang was able to create and improve the security systems for Vistacorp Headquarters and easily corrected and fixed a program that made the company overcharge customers in their transactions. Lang even able to hack the systems of Vistacorp Headquarters, stealing nearly four million dollars and paying back the money to Vistacorp's customers, even Hank Pym was impressed by his skill in hacking as Vistacorp Headquarters has one of the most advanced security systems in the world.
Expert Tactician: As a highly trained tactician, Lang has a keen mind for formulating elaborate plans and schemes, and is especially notable for being able to modify those plans to adapt to unforeseen circumstances at short notice - sometimes within seconds. Examples include when he discovers the fingerprint scanner in Hank Pym's home, when he discovers that the warehouse he is breaking into is actually now the New Avengers Facility, when he is discovered by Falcon, and when Darren Cross triples security on the Pym Technologies building, in all of these situations he was able to improvise and solve these problems quickly and effectively. He, alongside Hope van Dyne and Hank Pym, worked together on creating the heist mission to stop Darren Cross and steal the Yellowjacket Suit. He later orchestrated the breakout of Hope and Hank from police captivity.
Expert Martial Artist: Initially, Lang had limited fighting skills as he avoided confrontations during his heists. Hope van Dyne trained him and he slowly became a highly skilled fighter. His fighting style includes muay Thai, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, judo and American boxing. His skills, combined with the Ant-Man Suit, and shrinking powers, allowed him to defeat armed security personnel, and even beat Falcon and keep up with Black Widow in his respective duels with them, despite her being a supremely skilled hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist. Two years later, Scott retained his training and used it in a fight against Ghost at the Oui in conjunction with van Dyne, and the latter even commended his form when he caught her fist and kicked her to the floor.

Expert Acrobat: Lang is highly trained in acrobatics, parkour and free running maneuvers, leaping across steep divides and climbing difficult structures. He does not just perform these stunts in his shrunken state, but also when breaking into houses while in the process of thievery.
Musician: Lang was able to play Drums perfectly.
Equipment
Other Equipment
Ant-Man Suit: The suit can manipulate its wearer's size while simultaneously enhance both the wearer’s density and strength.
EMP Communication Device: Within the suit's helmet and in the form of earpieces developed by Hank Pym, allowing for the control of ants.
Pym Particles Disks: About the size of a coin and shaped like a triskelion-styled shuriken, the disks are filled with specified forms of Pym Particles. Targets impacted by Red Disks shrinks to the size of an insect. Targets impacted by Blue Disks enlarges to a bigger size.
Ankle Monitor: In the aftermath of the Clash of the Avengers, Lang was charged for using Hank Pym’s technology which were against the Sokovia Accords and was sentenced to serve two years under house arrest while ordered by the FBI to wear a tracker for monitoring his daily routines and positions.
Quantum Realm Exploration Suit: Lang wore this suit when he and the Avengers were performing a test to see if Time Travel through the Quantum Realm is possible.
Advanced Tech Suit: This suit was designed in order to time travel through the Quantum Realm safely. It is a white, red and black suit that materialize around the wearer's regular clothes, managing to be summoned when time travel is required again, and disappear when no longer in use. It has size-shifting adaptability down to subatomic levels and a wrist gadget that allows for displacement through time and space.
Vehicles
Luis' Van: After given parole from his time of house arrest, Scott rejoined with Hank, Janet, and Hope to use another different way to use the Quantum Tunnel by miniaturing it to an exact size to fit in the back of Luis‘s vehicle as transport for it.

Trivia
Ant-Man concept still
In the comics, Scott Lang is the second individual to take up the Ant-Man mantle with the approval of Hank Pym, after he originally steals the Ant-Man Suit in order to take care of his daughter Cassandra's medical bills. He also had a relationship with Jessica Jones.
His Giant-Man persona doesn't exist in the Earth-616 (Mainstream) Continuity, but rather on Earth-1610, the Ultimates comics. Here, Scott Lang never became Ant-Man, but inherits from Hank Pym the title of Giant-Man, a super-soldier working for S.H.I.E.L.D..

Scott Lang is the first character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to have taken over the mantle of a former superhero, followed by Robbie Reyes, Hope van Dyne and Sam Wilson.
According to Andy Park, in the early stages of development of Captain America: Civil War, Scott was meant to side with Iron Man during the Avengers Civil War, like Hank Pym in the original Civil War comic book storyline. This was later changed as the script evolved.
Behind the Scenes
Before Paul Rudd was cast as Ant-Man, Adrien Brody, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Simon Pegg and Ewan McGregor were all in the running for the role.
Colin Follenweider, Mark Wagner, Brett Smrz, Marlow Warrington-Mattei and James Harris were stunt doubles for Paul Rudd in the role of Ant-Man.
Michael Aaron Milligan, Brian Simpson and Kevin Marshall were stand-ins for Paul Rudd in the role of Ant-Man.
