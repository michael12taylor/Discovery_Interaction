<html><p>Micro found Henderson in a cabin in Kentucky. Castle went alone to find Henderson while Micro stayed with the van. When Castle was investigating the cabin, Henderson shot him with an arrow. He convinced Henderson to talk with him and that he is not a threat. Henderson revealed why he filmed the execution of Ahmad Zubair and discovered that Morty Bennett supervised the operation.

Castle ready to murder all of the Anvil agents
Meanwhile, a helicopter with Anvil agents landed in the woods. Assisted by Micro who spotted targets with a drone, Castle and Henderson took out the tactical team. Rawlins, who oversaw the operation, discovered that Castle is still alive. Both Castle and Henderson were badly wounded. Henderson died of blood loss, and Castle was rescued by Micro, who gave him basic medical treatment and brought him to the hideout. Micro asked Curtis Hoyle to help Castle. At the hideout, Hoyle removed the arrow from his shoulder and patched him up.

Slow Recovery
Castle imagined a Thanksgiving dinner with both the Castle and Lieberman families but they were surrounded by masked soldiers from the Cerberus Squad. Despite Castle's pleas, both families were slaughtered. Micro enlisted Curtis Hoyle's aid in treating Castle. Waking up, Castle's first thought was for Henderson. Micro informed him that his friend died and Castle worried about making good on his promise to Henderson. Micro told him that he has made arrangements for Henderson to receive a decent burial.

Reunion with Billy Russo
Castle is finally reunited back with Billy Russo
Castle got's a call from Billy Russo where the two would meet with each other. Coming to the outskirts of New York City, Castle and Russo were reunited as Russo offered his condolences for the deaths of Castle's family. As they sat down for a beer together, Russo questioned why Castle had not reached out to him, noting that Dinah Madani was aware of Castle's survival. Russo then told Castle about Anvil, with Castle teasing him over Russo's love for wearing fancy suits as well as cars and Russo's sexual relationship with Madani.

Castle sitting with Billy Russo to catch up
Castle told Russo what he knew of Operation Cerberus and their illegal actions in Kandahar, noting that he was now aware that Agent Orange, Ray Schoonover and Morty Bennett were selling heroin and using the profits to fund their illegal assassination missions, mentioning that Henderson had been killed when he had tried to blow the whistle on the entire operation. Seeking to end Castle's search for those responsible for Cerberus, Russo then offered him the chance to go work for Anvil overseas, noting that although Castle's family were gone they were still brothers.

With the offer to take a new job with Anvil overseas still on the table, Castle left to think it over and decide what would be the best move for him; however, Russo began planning for his friend's assassination, fearing that Castle could expose Cerberus Squad and ruin everything he had been building since leaving the United States Armed Forces.

Infiltration into Fort Bryon
Castle trying to find Fort Bryon
Castle and Micro planned their infiltration of the Fort Bryon where Morty Bennett is stationed in order to use him to get Agent Orange's name. Aided by Micro and his drone, Castle clipped the chained fence guarding the outside perimeter and managed to maneuver through the shadows, avoiding detention from foot soldiers. Meanwhile, Bennett dined and vented his frustration to his Mistress, whom he engaged in erotic role-play.

Castle interrogating Morty Bennett
With the arrival of Castle, she alerted Billy Russo and Anvil unit of his presence, Bennett attempted to grab his gun, but Castle pinned him to the wall and threatened him. Warned of approaching soldiers by Micro, Castle demanded that Bennett kept silent in a closet before dropping two smoke grenades and concealed his face. They silently searched for their target before being taken out one by one by Castle, who chose not to kill any of them. One agent found and aimed their rifle at Bennett by mistake, only for Castle to appear from the darkness and knock the man out. Eventually, Castle took out the final agent, non-lethally shooting him. At this time, Micro finished hacking and said Castle to escape. Castle leaped out of the window while the final agent continued shooting at him.

The base was put on alert in order to find the intruder. Castle successfully got to the exit but confronted with a young soldier who told Castle to surrender. He shot soldier in the arm and escaped on his van. Castle and Micro managed to escape the area and retreated to the hideout to await new intelligence from Bennett's phone.

Attack on William Rawlins
Having used a bug in Morty Bennett's phone, Micro tracked him down to the CIA Safe House. Castle and Micro arrived at the location and then Castle prepared his sniper rifle to find his target. Finally, he spotted Agent Orange, who came close to the window. Castle took his advantage and took a single shot right in the direction of Orange's head. However, he survived because the window's glass was bulletproof. The whole compound went to full alert and Castle and Micro managed to escape.

Helping the Liebermans
Castle being kissed by Sarah Lieberman
Arriving at the Lieberman house, Castle found out that Sarah Lieberman had unplugged the Internet to punish Zach Lieberman for his behavior, causing the cameras to go offline. However, she then admitted that she undermined herself by allowing him to go out. Sarah asked Castle to stay for a glass of wine.

Castle reactivated the Internet router in the Lieberman Residence. Unfortunately, this allowed Micro to see Lieberman drunkenly kissed Castle. While Castle gently rebuffs her advances, he returned to Micro's Hideout to find that Micro was now extremely drunk.

Castle and Micro discussing their own wives
Micro and Castle talked about how they each met their wives. Micro came to the decision that the only way back to his family is to involve Dinah Madani. Castle would be the witness she needed to take down William Rawlins. Unwilling to allow this to happen though, Castle responded by punching Micro out to stop him.

Frank and Micro having breakfast
Micro wakes up with a hangover but still thinks going to Madani is the best option. Sarah calls Frank for help with Zach. She is freaking out that she found a knife in his bag. Frank has a talk with Zach and manages to scare the kid enough for him to finally break down and admit that he is sad and scared.

Zach and Frank throw a football around, and Micro comes by. Frank tells him to leave before Zach sees him because it could lead to his family being killed. Frank promises to talk to Dinah.

New York Bombings
News Reports
Punisher and Micro watching Dinah Madani
Castle and Micro had continued to watch Dinah Madani through the window from a nearby rooftop in preparation for approaching her, noting how Madani seemed to still be mourning the death of Sam Stein. As they watched, the street below is rocked by an explosion. Castle and Micro watch the news where he stated his hatred of cowardly bombers. Castle said they are putting their plan to contact Madani on hold because of the current situation.

Castle getting ready to save Curtis Hoyle
Castle later read a newspaper article by Karen Page, whom the bomber had directly mailed, speaking out against the bomber, which he regarded as reckless provocation. Subsequently, Micro revealed that Page was on the Ricky Langtry Show with Senator Stan Ori, the latter of whom dragged Castle's name through the mud by bringing up his murder spree. The bomber called the show to spout his rhetoric, ending his call with sic semper tyrannis. Castle then suspected that Lewis Wilson from Hoyle's support group was the bomber on the radio and had Micro look up his address. Once obtained, Castle ignored Micro's suggestion to tip off the authorities or call Hoyle, knowing the latter would try to fix Wilson.

While staking out Clay Wilson's house, Castle then called Page to warn her against going after Wilson. Page suspected he knew something and insisted they do things the right way but Castle advised her to remain under FBI protection and hung up. Micro then informed him that he pinged both Wilson and Hoyle's cellphone at O'Connor's apartment, forcing Castle to head there.

Rescuing Curtis Hoyle
Frank trying to disarm the explosives on Curtis
Castle arrived at O'Connor's Residence to find Curtis Hoyle tied up and rigged with mines. Castle attempted to find a way to disarm the explosives, until Lewis Wilson, watching from a rooftop, called him.

Castle talking with the terrified Curtis Hoyle
Since Castle could not figure out how to disarm the bomb, Hoyle told Castle to leave him and admitted that he was living a lie. Despite looking like he had things together, he is as miserable and scared as the other United States Armed Forces veterans. Part of him thought it would have been better to die rather than just lose his leg. Hoyle had called the New York City Police Department so that there would be a witness to the explosion, but Castle wanted Hoyle to tell him how to disarm the bomb.

Identity Exposed
Castle chased by the New York City Police Department
Castle told Lewis Wilson the story of how Curtis Hoyle lost his leg, and how Castle was to blame for not shooting a suicide bomber in time because she was pregnant. Lewis finally told him to cut the white wire and then escaped. Castle disarmed the bomb then flees before the New York City Police Department arrive. However, he is spotted and chased. Cornered by a squad car, Castle knocks out the two police officers and steals the cruiser.

News breaks that the Punisher was still alive, the cop car that he stole captured a clear image of him via its dash camera.

Royal Hospitality Situation
Castle attempting to rescue Karen Page
Castle managed to track down Lewis Wilson to the Royal Hospitality where he intended to assassinate Senator Stan Ori. Avoiding Anvil agents stationed in the hotel to guard Ori, Castle infiltrated inside and called Billy Russo. Castle informed him that Wilson is targeting Ori, who Russo is currently providing protection for. He asked Russo to evacuate Ori and leave Wilson for him to deal with.

Karen Page arrived for her interview with Ori. She also says that Ori pushed Page into Wilson's arms to escape. Wilson then took Page hostage to escape while wearing a bomb vest, heading to the elevator he prepared earlier. When Lewis is clear of the floor, the surviving agents targeted Castle. Castle managed to avoid the hostiles and followed Wilson to the stairwell. In the stairwell, Castle was confronted by Dinah Madani who ordered him to surrender. However, Castle knew that Madani could not shoot him and went downstairs to chase Wilson.

Before he could leave, Castle was suddenly shot by Russo who wanted Castle killed. Madani shifted her attention to Russo and came to the realization that Russo led the mercenaries and killed Sam Stein. The New York City Police Department arrive and restrain Russo and Madani while wounded Castle fought back and used a fire hose reel to escape.

Castle and Karen Page survive the bomb blast
Castle followed Wilson and Page to the basement kitchen where he attempted to talk him down and used the story about how he helped Curtis Hoyle as a signal to Page to grab the white wire on Wilson's deadman's switch. She yanked the wire out to disarm the bomb, then uses the gun in her bag to shoot him in the foot. Wilson then locked him in a storage room, before Wilson used his own explosives to commit suicide. En route to the elevator, Castle was confronted by Brett Mahoney and the Emergency Service Unit who ordered Castle to surrender. Castle did not listen to Mahoney's orders, using Page as a human shield to get him to an elevator. Inside, Castle used the emergency hatch to escape into the shaft, reaching the roof to escape via a zip-line.

Rawlins and Russo
Ambush in Micro's Hideout
Punisher prepares himself for Anvil's assault
With everything in place for the incoming battle, the Punisher donned his Skull Vest and waited in the shadows while the Anvil agents had then arrived inside Micro's Hideout with their guns raised, as they all searched for their target. Keeping still, the Punisher kept himself from being found on their motion sensors, while waiting for the mercenaries to split up during their search, as he then managed to get behind one of their mercenaries and put him into a chock hold before brutally breaking his neck, ensuring that had nobody heard the death before the Punisher then silently went in search of his next target.

Punisher silently murders several Anvil agents
Using a booby trap that he had already set up, the Punisher had then managed to tie a noose around one mercenaries throat and lifted him into the air, until he chocked to death, before stabbing two more men in the throat, still without raising the alarm. As the Punisher brutalized the corpses, the mercenaries made it to Micro's computer system as they found footage of William Rawlins torturing Ahmad Zubair playing on a loop. While they were distracted, the Punisher cut off the head of one of the mercenaries and strapped a grenade to it, before simply tossing the bloody head at them as they all looked on in horror.

Punisher begins shooting at the Anvil agents
Before the men realized the danger, the grenade exploded, killing two more people before the Punisher had then used the distraction to his advantage, storming out of the shadows and engaging in his surprise gunfight with the mercenaries, who were all too disorientated by the explosion to realized what was happening. As the mercenaries finally regained their bearings, the Punisher took cover before shooting at a flash grenade he had hidden inside a light, blinding a man before he gunned him down. When one man had almost shot him, the Punisher pushed him back and shot in twice in the gut and then in the face.

Punisher shooting a soldier through the skull
Due to his own superior knowledge of the layout of their hideout, the Punisher was able to get around the mercenaries who could only fire blindly at where they thought he was. Grabbing the shotgun he had hidden earlier, the Punisher shot one mercenary into his Bulletproof Vest twice, knocking him into another mercenary who he shot point-blank in the face. As the other man then attempted to crawl away in agony, the Punisher calmly stepped over to him and shot him into the back of the head. However, Jack witnessed this and began shooting the Punisher in the back on his vest, forcing him to take cover.

Punisher calling out to Billy Russo to fight him
While more men began shooting at the Punisher, he took cover as he waited for them to reload, allowing them to believe that they had him cornered, while in reality, he had allowed them all to move to deadly positions. During the standoff with the mercenaries, the Punisher had furiously called out to Billy Russo, who he assumed would come into their ambush personally. As the Punisher vowed that he would watch Russo die, he got no answer from his former friend so he responded by then setting off a series of bombs that had been set up around the hideout, which had killed multiple mercenaries in those blasts.

Punisher furiously shooting at the mercenaries
As the surviving mercenaries recovered from the multiple explosions, the Punisher then grabbed his FN M249 SAW that had been hidden beside him and began furiously gunning down multiple men, with all the shots being powerful enough to tear through all their bulletproof vests. As one man took cover behind a pillar, the Punisher continued shooting at him, forcing him to stay hidden, before the Punisher then dropped the gun and had plunged his knife into the man's chest. The Punisher witnessed Jack helping another mercenary to his feet, as he gunned down the other man, leaving only him and Jack standing.

Castle after slashing the back of Jack's thighs
In the confusion of the battle, the Punisher mistook the masked Jack for Russo, as he had then furiously thrown his knife at the mercenary, embedding it into his shoulder which allowed the Punisher to charge forward and engage with his enemy one on one. Kicking him across the room, the Punisher witnessed Jack rip the knife from his shoulder as he then attempted to defend himself, but the Punisher had soon proved himself to be the superior fighter, while he managed to disarm Jack and stabbed him in the gut, before brutally ripping the knife out and throwing him over the table, which left Jack defenseless.

Punisher shooting an Anvil agent in the face
While Jack attempted to get on his feet, the Punisher, still believing it to be Russo, slashed at his legs to cause him more pain. However, all of the sounds of Jack's screams of agony soon made him realize that it was the wrong man, as the Punisher called out into the Hideout for Russo, and got no answer, as he realized that Russo was not in here. Walking through the Hideout to inspect all of the bodies, the Punisher found a wounded man attempting to crawl away, as the Punisher had removed his helmet and mask to check his identity and, when he had confirmed it was not Russo, proceeded to shoot him in the face.

Punisher brutally tortures and executes Jack
Frustrated that he was not able to locate and kill Russo, the Punisher then overheard the badly wounded Jack attempting to crawl away to safety. Walking over to him, the Punisher first removed Jack's mask before questioning where Russo was. As Jack failed to answer him, the Punisher simply shot him into the leg before he then questioned where Sarah and Zach Lieberman were, only for Jack to insist that he had not been given that information. Believing that Jack really did not know, the Punisher accepted his answer and calmly executed him by shooting him in the head, before searching his pockets for a phone.

Punisher making the phone call to Billy Russo
Surrounded by the corpses of all of the Anvil soldiers he had gunned down the Punisher took Jack's phone and used it to call Russo. As he sat in silence, the Punisher listened as Russo mockingly answered the call, knowing what had happened to all his men, as the Punisher noted that the Russo he had served within the United States Marine Corps would have been brave enough to come to the ambush alone, although Russo simply commented on how he had men of his own who could be sent to the fights. The Punisher warned that eventually, they would face each other one on one, although Russo denied this.

Punisher making his new deal with Billy Russo
Having noted how the Punisher was now a wanted man, Russo then questioned him over what exactly was on all of the computers, only for the Punisher instead questioned where Lieberman's family were, as Russo promised they were with him and could be put into danger soon. Hearing this, the Punisher explained how the computers held the secrets about Operation Cerberus that Russo and Rawlins were trying to bury, as they made the deal to exchange Sarah and Zach for Micro and the Punisher, as Russo had then promised to make all the arrangements for their exchange while the Punisher hung up.

Reunion with Leo Lieberman
Castle comes back in contact with the group
Having cleared out all of the Anvil agents, Castle then gotten back in contact with Dinah Madani, as he requested that she come alone to a secure location. Castle kept himself out of sight as Madani arrived alone and greeted Micro, who was waiting for Castle alongside Leo Lieberman. Once he was certain that Madani had come alone, as he requested, Castle stepped out of the shadows, and joined them, with Micro noting that they had been worried that he might have been killed during the gunfight against Anvil.

Castle talking to Leo Lieberman on his secrets
Castle teased Madani about pulling her gun on him again, following their last encounter at the Royal Hospitality, before he made it clear that if Micro trusted Madani, then he did as well. Having seen Leo in the Van with her father, Castle stepped over to her side and told her she had done well to survive. However, Leo noted that Castle always knew her father was alive the entire time, which Castle confirmed and apologized for. As Leo had noted that she did not know what to call him, Castle reintroduced himself, with Leo noting that he was scarier than Pete had been, which Castle had acknowledged was true.

Homeland Security Interview
Castle getting interviewed by Dinah Madani
Having agreed to work with Dinah Madani, Castle was then taken to the Homeland Security Headquarters, where he then agreed to do an interview directly on the camera, exposing everything that he had uncovered, regarding the Rawlins Conspiracy. Sitting down with Madani, Castle gave his name for the record, scoffing as Madani gave him their legal statements that he had to agree to before he would testify. Castle was asked to confirm his time in the Marine Corps, before being asked about his final mission.

Castle is asked about his mission in Kandahar
Castle told Madani about their Operation Cerberus, which he called a covert CIA operation, claiming that their mission was to apprehend, interrogate and assassinate targets in Afghanistan. As Madani asked him to confirm why there were no records, Castle became frustrated, as Madani already knew that. With Madani requesting the answer on tape, Castle explained that the operation was illegal and was funded through the sales of heroin out of Kandahar, noting that the operation was run by Ray Schoonover and Morty Bennett, as well as the former SAC of Homeland, Carson Wolf, all of whom were now deceased.

Castle upholds Billy Russo to be responsible
Castle then also confessed to killing Schoonover and Wolf, although he noted that Bennett was murdered by his allies, since Castle put a target on Bennett's back. When Madani asked Castle who this target was for, Castle looked directly into the camera, and said that William Rawlins was the man in charge, and had ordered Bennett's death, as he named Rawlins' rank in the CIA, as he claimed that Cerberus was founded by Rawlins. When asked who else was involved, Castle then named Billy Russo, telling the camera that Russo was a fellow marine who had worked for Rawlins, noting that Madani already knew this.

Castle being asked about all Cerberus' targets
Castle was then presented with a photograph of Ahmad Zubair, as he confirmed Zubair was one of Cerberus Squad's targets, confessing that they had followed Rawlins' orders and kidnapped Zubair in front of his terrified wife and family, before he was tortured and executed. Madani asked Castle to admit that he had witnessed everything that had happened to Zubair, while he confirmed that it was Rawlins who gave these orders, with Castle commented that there was already the video, that Gunner Henderson recorded that showed Zubair's torture and execution, admitting that the video had damned all of them.

Castle admitting into executing Ahmad Zubair
Madani then asked if Russo had executed Zubair once Rawlins gave the order, which Castle denied, as he confessed that he was actually the one who pulled the trigger and killed Zubair, much to the shock of Madani, as he once again noted that this video had damned them all. Castle and Homeland Security then came to an agreement, for them to stage their exchange for Sarah and Zach Lieberman, in which they would try to capture both Russo and Rawlins. However, Castle and Micro came up with his separate plan allowing Castle to be captured, in order for him to get a chance to murder Rawlins and Russo.

Rescue of the Liebermans
Castle and Micro awaiting the arrival of Anvil
Having made an arrangement with Billy Russo, Castle and Micro had gone to the location and awaited the arrival of the Anvil agents, with Micro noting that they were late, although Castle insisted that they were already there and watching them from afar. Castle had then listened while Micro theorized that they could shoot them down from there, and questioned if his wife and son were already dead, to which Castle then reassured him that they were clearly needed alive.

Castle talking to Micro about their plan
Castle reassured Micro that having footage of Ahmad Zubair's death along with the countdown at the Hideout had clearly done what they intended, which was why Anvil had not killed them. As Micro had still doubted their plans, Castle then ordered him not to have any second thoughts, telling him to quiet down his thoughts. However, Micro had then noted that Castle did not really have to do any of this for him or his family, to which Castle promised that he would not allow anything to happen to Sarah and Zach, ordering Micro to stick to their plan, no matter what happened, which Micro had reluctantly agreed to.

Castle watches Anvil releases the Liebermans
While Castle quietly pulled out the wire that was hidden in his jacket pocket, Micro expressed his gratitude to him over everything that he was doing for his family. However, they were then interrupted as the Anvil agents arrived on the scene, as Sarah and Zach were taken out of the van. Castle reminded Micro to stay calm as he watched their masks being removed, and the Lieberman's looked at each other for the first time in a year. Castle and Micro watched as the Anvil agents stabbed the cans of petrol that they strapped onto Sarah and Zach's backs, threatening to burn them with flares if anything went wrong.

Castle listens to orders that he has to follow
Castle answered Russo's phone call, as he instructed him and Micro to get into the van or he would have the two Lieberman's burnt alive. Castle then mocked Russo for failing to get past Micro's computers, which was why they had both not been shot down, only for Russo to insist they focus on the exchange for these Lieberman's. Following all Russo's instructions, Castle and Micro had walked forward, while they passed Sarah and Zach, with Castle telling Micro to just remain focused despite Sarah looking straight at him and also attempting to touch his hand, as the continued to approach the Anvil agents.

Castle being unconscious and dragged away
However, as they had arranged, the exchange was interrupted by the arrival of Homeland Security, getting led by Dinah Madani. This then resulted with a shootout, during which Castle had allowed their Anvil agents to knock him unconscious and drag him back inside the van. Although Castle was captured, the rest of the plan went according to plan, as Sarah and Zach were then rescued by Madani's agents, and Micro was able to fake his own demise during the chaos, since these Homeland agents shot his Bulletproof Vest, causing all Russo's men to then drive away from the scene with only Castle in custody.

Tortured by Rawlins
Castle's life is threatened by Billy Russo
Castle was captured by Billy Russo who wanted to unlock Micro's computers which were on a countdown clock. Castle asked Russo did he trust William Rawlins, similar to how he trusted Morty Bennett before his murder. Rawlins answered that he and Russo had some mutual interest. Rawlins put on his Leather Gloves while Castle asked were they the same ones he used to torture Ahmad Zubair, Rawlins replied that these were special and for Castle's interrogation only. Rawlins proceeded to slap Castle around and punch him repeatedly while the latter mocked him. Rawlins stopped the torture after two hours of beating Castle, taking a break while Russo convinced Castle to enter the codes into Micro's computer. Rawlins told Castle he was deeply disappointed on how he broke so easily under torture.

Castle biting into William Rawlins' neck
However, Castle was using their overconfidence to get the blade he hid under his chair, which he used to furiously stab Rawlins in the chest. Russo attempted to stop Castle but the latter continued and bit Rawlins on the neck, causing the agent to scream in agony. As the two wrestled, Russo struck Castle with his gun, leading to Castle letting his grip go. Rawlins proceeded to kick Castle in anger and knocked him unconscious. Enraged, Rawlins mocked Castle for being nothing but a military grunt and did not have the right to kill him and continued to torture him.

Castle being tortured by William Rawlins
Russo interrupted Rawlins and told that they should focus on wiping everything on Micro's computers and will kill Castle himself. Rawlins refused, stating that he wanted to kill Castle for everything he took from him and have the latter begging for his life. Russo questioned what Rawlins had meant by Castle taking things from him, as Rawlins had inadvertently revealed that Marion James had taken his position from him.

Castle being almost executed by Billy Russo
Rawlins continued to torture Castle by pushing his finger into his wound; causing Russo to drag Rawlins away. Rawlins reminded Russo that he pulled Russo out of the mud after Afghanistan, and reminded Russo that he murdered Homeland Security agents and gotten this far by him. Russo claimed that he wish Castle had killed him back in Kandahar, causing Rawlins to laugh in his face. Russo proceeded to place a gun to Castle's head, leading to Rawlins to pull out his handgun, ordering Russo to step away and not take away his revenge, stating that Castle owed him an eye.

Punisher preparing to murder William Rawlins
Unbeknownst to Rawlins, Russo had cut Castle's cord, allowing him to kill the agent. Russo left Castle's side and took away Rawlins' gun, who continued his torture by injecting Castle with adrenaline to keep alive long enough. The Anvil agents left after the hacker succeeded to wipe all of Micro's files as Rawlins proceeded to test Castle's heartbeat. Rawlins grabbed the weapon he would get his revenge on Castle, holding a blade to stab out his eye for payback.

Punisher collapses by William Rawlins' corpse
Castle stopped Rawlins, knocking him on the ground, learning of Russo's betrayal. Rawlins stabbed Castle into his side, but the latter took it out of his side and stabbed the agent's throat and shoulder. Russo watched from afar, allowing Castle to kill his former ally. Castle told Rawlins that he was a reminder of the crimes he committed and the punishment that came for them. Castle proceeded to punch the agent repeatedly, ending his life by pushing his thumbs into his eyes. Castle then fell to ground beside Rawlins' corpse, tired of holding his own from his torture and killing the CIA agent.

Attack on Curtis Hoyle
Punisher attempting to shoot at Billy Russo
Seeking to find Billy Russo as soon as possible, Castle realized that he would likely decide to confront Curtis Hoyle in order to learn if he had known of Castle's whereabouts. Castle's prediction was correct as he took up a sniping position directed at Hoyle's Apartment where he had Hoyle move Russo by a window where Castle could shoot him. However, at the last moment, Russo predicted what was happening and dived for cover, which caused Castle to miss his shot.

Punisher tries to ensure Curtis Hoyle's safety
In the chaos, Russo was able to shoot Hoyle in the shoulder as they both vanished from Castle's view, although Castle still kept his close watch on the window which Russo was hiding under and shot at his knife when Russo had wanted to check if Castle was still out there. In order to find out what was happening, Castle then called Hoyle who informed him that he had been shot in the shoulder and was bleeding badly. Castle had then asked Hoyle to put Russo on the phone, with Russo noting how they knew one another so well that they had been able to predict exactly how the other would react to the situation.

Punisher and Billy Russo agree to their fight
As Castle tried to get Hoyle safe, he noted that nobody else needed to die, to which Russo vowed to hurt anyone Castle ever cared about to get to him. As Castle had promised on his honor as a Marine to let Russo walk if he let Hoyle go, Russo noted that he could let Hoyle bleed out, as Castle promised to call Homeland Security if he did that. Russo then demanded that Castle empty his sniper rifle first. As Russo got up, he suggested they meet at Central Park for their final battle, wanting it to be where Castle's entire family had been gunned down, before Russo had then simply walked out of the door.

Duel at the Central Park Carousel
Punisher prepares to fight against Billy Russo
Staying true to his word, Castle headed out into Central Park, having donned his Skull Vest and armed himself with multiple weapons for his showdown with Billy Russo. Upon arriving, Punisher kept himself hidden in the shadows until he witnessed the Carousel being activated, giving Punisher flashbacks of his family. Getting his mind back on the mission, Punisher checked through his rifle scope and discovered that Russo had kidnapped Carl and Hayley and tied them to the horses, with wounds that they were bleeding heavily from.

Punisher shooting his grenades at Billy Russo
Just as Punisher watched the kids suffering, he received a phone call from Russo who questioned if he was already out there in the woods, before mockingly reminding Punisher of how Carl and Hayley did not have long left until they would both bleed out from their wounds, as Russo then gave Punisher a reminded of the ticking clock he had to save them before he hung up their call. Unwilling to allow two more children to die because of Russo's actions, Punisher then proceeded to fire off several grenades into the air, intending to distract Russo for a brief but vital moment while he made his move to get closer.

Punisher and Billy Russo exchanging gunfire
However, Russo spotted Punisher coming at him and began firing at his former friend, as the two exchanged gunfire before Punisher was struck into the leg, forcing him to take cover. While Punisher was in cover, Russo continued shooting at him, as the Punisher waited for an opening and fired back. However, Russo managed to retreat onto the Carousel itself, giving the Punisher time to bandage up his leg before returning to the fight. Sticking to cover, the Punisher ensured that Russo was out of sight before then stepping onto the Carousel himself while keeping his weapon raised and ready to be fired.

Punisher attempting to shoot at Billy Russo
With the Punisher now on the Carousel, he was then suddenly hit by multiple flashbacks of his wife and two children playing on that same Carousel on the day that they were all massacred in front of him. As all these images flashed in front of his face, the Punisher focused on the cries of desperation from Carl and Hayley and then continued to attempt to find Russo onboard the Carousel. During his search, the Punisher heard Russo mockingly call out to him, claiming that guys like them needed this type of conflict and that they were never good people and deserved nothing better than what they had gotten.

Punisher gets distracted by all his memories
Checking the mirrors around the Carousel, the Punisher managed to find where Russo was hiding as the two began exchanging gunfire, using the horses as cover before the Punisher made a tactical retreat, forcing Russo to hunt him down. Russo then continued mocking his former friend, claiming that nobody would mourn them and that they were the same kind of man. At that moment, Russo managed to find the Punisher as they shot at each other again, with Russo hitting the Punisher right in his Bulletproof Vest, while the Punisher shot Russo directly in the face, causing Russo to fall onto his knees in pain.

Punisher surrendering his guns for Billy Russo
While Russo pulled the bullet from his cheek, the Punisher recovered and drew his handgun, having dropped his assault rifle, until Russo, furious at having his handsome face permanently scarred, yelled out to the Punisher to end their fight once and for all. While the Punisher kept his weapon raised up, Russo shut down the Carousel ride and aimed his gun directly at Carl and Hayley's heads, promising that if the Punisher did not come out into the open, then he would execute the kids without a second thought, forcing them to desperately beg for their lives until the Punisher finally came around the corner.

Punisher being shot repeatedly by Billy Russo
Once he was out in the open, the Punisher told Russo to let the kids go free, only for Russo to keep his weapon on them and demand that the Punisher throw his gun and knife aside. With no other choice, the Punisher did as Russo instructed as Russo lowed his weapon from the kids, threatening that if they did not shut up he would shoot them both. As the Punisher still demanded that Russo let these kids go, he was told that attachments were a weakness as Russo then shot him in his skull vest, knocking the Punisher onto the ground, although the Punisher had claimed that Russo had once had the Castle family.

Punisher furiously beating down Billy Russo
Just as Russo mocked the Punisher's name, calling it a crock of shit, they were interrupted by the arrival of Dinah Madani, who had come to capture or kill Russo. However, Russo was altered to this as Carl called out to Madani for help, as Russo spun around and managed to shoot Madani directly in the skull, as her lifeless body dropped to the ground. Witnessing this, the Punisher had furiously charged at Russo while his back was turned as they wrestled for Russo's weapon, with neither managing to shoot the other until their gun had been thrown aside and they then continued fighting with just their bare fists.

Although Russo's speed proved superior for a while as he smashed the Punisher's face into the steel poles and kicked him to the ground, the Punisher managed to use his brute force to gain an advantage as he countered Russo's punch before lifting him straight up into the air and slamming him onto the ground. From here, the Punisher began repeatedly punching Russo in the face, until Russo was finally able to avoid his strike, causing the Punisher to painfully hit the hard floor, as Russo then punched him right into the throat, knocking the Punisher back as Russo drew his knife, prepared to kill his former friend.

However, the Punisher was swiftly able to disarm Russo and pushed him back against one of the mirrors before he attempted to plunge Russo's own knife into his eyeball. While Russo held back the knife, he looked the Punisher directly into the eye and smiled, before then drawing his own Hidden Blade, which penetrated the Punisher's arm. With the Punisher now severely wounded and with Russo armed with two blades, he was now on the defensive as Russo swung these two blades at him repeatedly, cutting into his skull vest while the Punisher landed several more counter strikes during throughout their clash.

Eventually, Russo managed to gain a full advantage during their fight, knocking the Punisher into the mirror and cracking it, before stabbing his Hidden Blade into the Punisher's shoulder, causing him to drop to the floor in agony while the mirror behind him fell apart. While Russo looked down upon his former friend, he mockingly told the Punisher to look at himself as he was pathetic, before ripping the blade out of his shoulder and preparing to finish him off once and for all. However, the Punisher managed to find the broken shard of glass and stabbed Russo in the gut with it, causing Russo to then stop in his tracks.

With the broken shard of the mirror now imbedded into Russo's gut, the Punisher got back onto his feet while he looked his former friend directly in the eye before pushing him away, allowing Russo to pull the shard out as his blood poured out of the open wound. Although Russo tried to regain his strength and fight back, he had become too weak as the Punisher took full advantage, punching Russo into the mirror. Having cracked the mirror, the Punisher decided to take away Russo's most valued asset, as he grabbed Russo's face, dragging it down a broken mirror, tearing Russo's face apart as he screamed.

Punisher deciding to allow Billy Russo survive
Having been pulled away from the mirror, a horrifically scarred Russo had attempted to fight back, only for the Punisher to break his arm and slam him face-first into the mirror. Having collected Russo's own knife, the Punisher gave him a moment to look at his mangled face, before holding the blade to Russo's throat. Unwilling to live like that, Russo begged him to kill him, as the Punisher considered every life that Russo had taken or destroyed through all of his selfish actions with William Rawlins. However, the Punisher decided to give Russo a worse punishment and removed the knife, choosing not to kill him.

Despite Russo begging for death, the Punisher told him dying would be too easy, before kicking him, face first, into the mirror. Grabbing ahold of Russo's hair, the Punisher proceeded to smash his face into the cracked mirror repeatedly, ripping his face to shreds while telling Russo that he would learn about pain and loss. Before Russo had lost consciousness, the Punisher told him about his grief towards his own dead family, and how every morning he would search for them. The Punisher promised that whenever Russo looked at his reflection and only saw ugliness, he would always be reminded of his day.

Punisher attempting to save Dinah Madani
Having smashed Russo's face in the mirror a final time, the Punisher had left his bleeding body behind and instead went to care for Carl and Hayley, cutting them down and setting them free. Once the kids were safe, the Punisher then went to Madani's aid, finding that she was bleeding heavily from that gunshot wound into her skull. As the Punisher sat with Madani and held her head in his lap, he had heard the sound of the New York City Police Department coming to their location, but made no attempt to escape. Carl and Hayley then sat down beside the Punisher and thanked him for saving their lives.

A New Life
Some Kind of Justice
Castle getting released from the DHS agents
In the aftermath of the fight in Central Park, Castle had then been taken back into custody by the Homeland Security and spent the next three days in Sacred Saints Hospital. During Castle's long and ongoing recovery from all his injuries sustained during their clash, Rafael Hernandez and Marion James had then later joined Dinah Madani, as she recovered in their hospital having been shot in the head by Billy Russo. Kept in handcuffs, Castle was brought to speak with them, as Hernandez ordered Castle's handcuffs to get taken off.

Castle comments on Dinah Madani's survival
Now that those handcuffs were taken off, Castle then commented on Madani's survival and questioned if she saved his life, as James had stepped forward, commenting that they would not take away his life. Castle was told from James that he would be getting a free pass due to the debt the country owed to him due to William Rawlins' betrayal, as he confirmed if this was the pay off in order to ensure that he kept his mouth shut about Rawlins and the CIA, to which James had then confirmed. James had explained that Lewis Wilson and Russo would be the only ones involved with all of those recent terrorist attacks.

Castle getting the clean slate from his records
As Hernandez went on, Castle was told that the prints and DNA had been wiped from the system and replaced with those of a dead man. Castle then questioned if they had considered having him killed, only to be told that it had been Madani's idea, as all of those men that she knew needed be punished, were dead. After his issue had been dealt with, Castle was told by James to enjoy his new freedom. Castle had asked Hernandez about Russo following his disfigurement, being told that Russo was in a coma and all the doctors were still unsure of how much damage his brain had actually suffered during the beating.

With his conflict seemingly concluded, Castle had then headed over into St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church, as he had finally made the decision to join in with Curtis Hoyle's regular therapy sessions, in order to deal with the trauma of losing his family. While setting up all the chairs for the veterans who would also be joining them in the session, Castle was visited by Hoyle, who had jokingly commented that Castle was clearly a shit magnet of the highest order, following everything that he had experienced, which Castle did not deny.

Castle talking with Curtis Hoyle's rehab center
Castle had then questioned if opening up like this would actually be a good idea, Hoyle reassured him that he would be safe there, while he promised that everything he said would stay confidential. Castle took Hoyle's advice, as he stayed until the rest of the United States Armed Forces veterans had shown up. As Castle spoke to their group about his feelings since leaving the Armed Forces, he had noted that since he had killed William Rawlins, and defeated Billy Russo, he no longer has any sort of objective or mission to fulfill, Castle admitted to being scared for not knowing what the rest of his life may hold for him.

That evening, Castle had decided to stop by Lola's Roadhouse, as he watched Shooter Jennings' performance and requested another beer, turning down an offer for the tab.

Castle first encounters Amy Bendix at the bar
While Castle remained at the bar, he witnessed Amy Bendix come to the bar and ordering a soft drink from Beth Quinn. When Bendix had noticed Castle looking her, she questioned what he wanted from her, while referring to him as "rough road," which Castle merely chuckled at. Since Bendix continued looking at him, Castle glanced over to her again, as she again questioned what he wanted, to which Castle had just claimed that Bendix was the one who had actually been looking at him, before he questioned if Bendix was doing okay, only for her to just pay Quinn for the drink and then walk away from the bar.

Castle telling Johnny to stop his harassment
Once Bendix had walked away, Castle and Quinn shared a joke by commenting on her manners, with Quinn also referring to Castle as "rough road" which he laughed at. Once Castle later returned to the bar having been to the bathroom, he noticed that Quinn was getting harassed by Johnny, who had been insisting that she drink with him. Although Castle had initially attempted to keep his distance to avoid trouble, he eventually stepped in when Johnny's advances became more sexual and demanding, as he then ordered Johnny to let go of Quinn's arm and simply allow her to continue with her work.
