<html><p>Barton promised his clearly nervous wife that this would be his final mission with the Avengers and vowed that he would return and finish redecorating the house, although Laura had still teased that he would inevitably find another project that he would start on after that. They kissed each other goodbye and Barton left with the Avengers, taking control of the Quinjet and then flew their team to Seoul to search for Ultron, as well as the Maximoff twins, and finally end the war.

Striking Back
Battle of Seoul
Hawkeye overlooking Seoul to locate Ultron
Their team arrived in Seoul where Captain America departed from the Quinjet to do recon and had eventually found Helen Cho lying injured in the remains of her Laboratory. They discovered Bruce Banner was right about Ultron attempting to build himself a body using the Regeneration Cradle. Flying overhead, Hawkeye and Black Widow searched for Ultron, Black Widow had suggested that he could be at a private jet taking off.

Hawkeye manages to find Ultron on the road
Before long, however, Hawkeye spotted a truck from the lab driving away, as he scanned the inside and confirmed that Ultron was inside along with the Cradle and several Ultron Sentries. Hawkeye informed Captain America of this and then told him that he could eliminate the driver, but Captain America stopped him, warning him of the danger of the stone. With little time remaining, Captain America then went to stop the truck himself, drawing out Ultron away from the cradle.

Hawkeye sees Captain America fighting Ultron
Captain America attempted to distract Ultron by engaging him in one on one combat as the truck drove through the roads of Seoul, hoping that this would ensure that he could not complete his plan of building his newest body inside the Cradle. Seeing that Captain America was facing Ultron alone, Hawkeye made it clear that he was considerably outmatched by the robot during their fight, something which Captain America was clearly frustrated to hear from his own teammate.

Hawkeye sending Black Widow into the fight
While Captain America had continued fighting against Ultron on the roads, Hawkeye made his way through the city, eventually catching up to Captain America and prepared to drop Black Widow out of the Quinjet on a Motorcycle to aid Captain America and also obtain the cradle. As Hawkeye dropped Black Widow, telling her to give Ultron hell, he navigated her towards the truck's current position but had no shot at it from the Quinjet, while giving Black Widow directions.

Hawkeye is ordered to take his shot at Ultron
Having managed to catch back up with the truck, Black Widow then returned Captain America's Shield and asked Hawkeye to draw away the Ultron Sentries who were currently guarding the truck so that she could then attempt to get inside. Hawkeye made his way in front of the truck and began firing at Ultron, knowing that the Sentries would come after him in defense. Hawkeye then began to fly straight up, in the hope of leading these Ultron Sentries away from the others.

Hawkeye dodges Ultron's incoming attacks
As a result of this assault, however, Hawkeye had then found himself under attack by the Sentries, who were attempting to blast through the cockpit. However, Hawkeye was able to maneuver away from the Sentries, while spinning the Quinjet around to throw them off. When Captain America removed Ultron from the truck and threw him onto a moving train, the Sentries went to return to the truck to protect it as Hawkeye had advised Black Widow make her next move soon.

Hawkeye steals the Regeneration Cradle away
When the Sentries had returned to the truck, they attempted to fly it away. Hawkeye went to take out the truck since the explosion would be out of range of any civilians, but Black Widow alerted him that she was inside, much to Hawkeye's shock and frustration. Black Widow then informed Hawkeye to be ready to receive the cradle by lining up with the truck. With time running out, Hawkeye then advised Captain America that it was time to go while Black Widow freed the Cradle.

Hawkeye asking for Black Widow's location
As Black Widow then jumped from the truck with the cradle, she was then grabbed by Ultron at the last second, but still able to deliver it to Hawkeye. Hawkeye then called out to her, worried for her safety and asked Captain America if he knew of her status. However, he ordered Hawkeye to take the cradle to Stark, much to Hawkeye's dismay as he pleaded to rescue her. Hawkeye reluctantly left Seoul and headed to Avengers Tower, frustrated over leaving his best friend behind.

Birth of the Vision
Barton discusses finding Natasha Romanoff
Bringing the Regeneration Cradle back to Avengers Tower from Seoul, Barton first caught back up with Tony Stark and Bruce Banner who were getting prepared to study it. Barton attempted to physically open the Cradle but was not able to. Banner asked if there was any word on Natasha Romanoff, but Stark confirmed that they had not heard anything. Stark suggested that Romanoff might be using old school spy techniques to send out a message for Barton to search for.

Barton successfully finds Natasha Romanoff
Taking Stark's advice, Barton then immediately began searching for Romanoff by working out where Ultron may have taken her, listening out for any Morse code messages being sent out through the airways which would not be heard by any of their high tech machinery. Before long, Barton managed to find a signal she was sending over the radio waves which revealed her location to be in Sokovia, which confirmed that Romanoff was still alive, much to Barton's considerable relief.

Barton manages to outwit Pietro Maximoff
Having confirmed Romanoff was being held in the Facility which had been previously owned by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, he went to inform the rest of their team. However, Barton soon discovered that during the Battle of Seoul aftermath, Steve Rogers had also recruited both Pietro and Wanda Maximoff as they had betrayed Ultron. Barton was present as Stark and Banner were confronted when they tried to upload J.A.R.V.I.S. into the same body Ultron had been creating.

Barton standing smugly over Pietro Maximoff
The realization of Stark's latest plan resulted in a massive argument breaking out, which Barton had stayed out of, although he remained close by. When Pietro had then attempted to sabotage the machine by ripping out its wires, Barton was able to defeat him by firing his gun at the glass below his feet, causing it to shatter as Pietro fell and landed onto the floor by Barton's feet, as Barton mockingly repeated what Maximoff had taunted him during their other encounter.

Barton witnesses the creation of the Vision
As tensions still rising between the Avengers, Stark and Rogers had finally begun to fight, with Rogers then using his shield to do more damage to the machinery, until they were interrupted by the sudden arrival of Thor who proceeded to use lightning to activate machine. The being within jumped out and briefly attacked Thor until he looked out over New York City. Having calmed down, the being apologized and called itself the Vision, much to Barton's complete shock.

Barton watches Vision giving Mj√∏lnir to Thor
As they spoke to Vision, Wanda noted how she had seen annihilation inside his head, to which Barton made it clear that he did not trust anything that either of the Maximoff twins had to say on any subject. Barton then informed the team of Romanoff's current location back in Novi Grad while Vision claimed that he intended to assist them in fighting Ultron. As proof of his honor, Vision simply handed Thor back his weapon while Barton and the rest of the team were shocked.

Hawkeye collecting his weapons for battle
As the team prepared for their mission, Barton collected his uniform and weaponry ready for the oncoming battle. Barton took a moment to look at the photograph of his family to remind himself of what he was fighting for. Barton then took control of the Quinjet and flew the Avengers into Sokovia while Rogers gave them a speech about what they had to expect from Ultron and vowing that they would protect all of the innocent people of Sokovia before confronting Ultron.

Battle of Sokovia
Hawkeye and Captain America in Sokovia
The team soon located Ultron in Novi Grad where he had planned to continue his evil schemes. Once the Avengers had arrived; Captain America made it clear that the first priority was to evacuate all of the civilians to ensure their safety.

Hawkeye watches the evacuation of Sokovia
The Avengers landed and as they exited the Quinjet, Captain America had then noticed some graffiti written on a wall which Hawkeye had commented as not bad. Hawkeye sat in the clock tower and overlooked the whole evacuation, watching as Wanda Maximoff continued to use her mind control power to convince the people to leave while Hawkeye had ensured that the Ultron Sentries did not attack the people.

Hawkeye battles against Ultron's army
Eventually, Ultron made his move and sent out his armies of Ultron Sentries to attack the Avengers, targeting their fire at the civilians so the Avengers would have to prioritize protecting them over stopping Ultron directly. As the battle broke out, Hawkeye had stayed close to Maximoff and begun shooting the Sentries out of the sky with his arrows while Maximoff also created an energy shield to keep the civilians safe from Ultron: However, they were soon overpowered.

Hawkeye witnesses Sokovia being raised up
However, despite the best efforts of Vision to incapacitate Ultron, the A.I. was able to activate his machine in the center of Sokovia which caused a massive Earthquake. As Hawkeye tried to understand what was happening, he watched on in horror as the ground around them shattered and Novi Grad began rising up into the sky, as Ultron had created his device with all the Vibranium which he stole from Ulysses Klaue to turn all of Novi Grad into his own destructive meteorite.

Hawkeye shoots another Sentry out of the sky
When one of the Sentries gave a speech about Ultron's plan to wipe out all of humanity with his meteorite, Hawkeye shot it out of the sky, only for another Sentry to continue the speech regardless. Following the orders of Captain America, Hawkeye and all the rest of the team engaged the robots in the major battle, while focusing on protecting the civilians. As Maximoff had created more forcefields to defend the people from the blasts, Hawkeye engaged them all in battle.

Helping Scarlet Witch
Hawkeye battles the multiple Ultron Sentries
With the battle still raging across Novi Grad, which had continued to rise higher and higher into the sky, Hawkeye stayed close by Wanda Maximoff as even more Ultron Sentries continued attacking them. While Hawkeye used his training from S.H.I.E.L.D. to avoid the Sentries' attacks and destroy as many as he could, he noticed that Maximoff was struggling to cope with such an onslaught.

Hawkeye motivates Wanda Maximoff to fight
As they had swiftly become completely overwhelmed by the endless attacks from the Ultron Sentries, Hawkeye saved Maximoff and hid her in a building while she had her panic attack. Maximoff believed everything that was happening was her fault, since she had sided with Ultron and helped him obtain the Vibranium from Ulysses Klaue. As he saw this, Hawkeye tried to reassure her that nobody cared about that anymore and simply questioned if she was ready to continue their fight.

Hawkeye makes Wanda Maximoff an Avenger
Wanting Maximoff to make her choice, Hawkeye then noted that the entire city was flying and he was battling an army of robots with nothing but a Bow and Arrow. Hawkeye finally managed to calm her down as he told Maximoff that he would continue to fight and it was her choice to stay or run, promising to go get her brother to help her if needed. However, he assured Maximoff that if she continued fighting, she would be an Avenger, before getting up and readying himself for the continued battle.

Hawkeye attempting to fight off Ultron's army
Hawkeye then loaded his bow and charged out of the door, leaving Maximoff to consider what he had said to her. With Ultron Sentries still baring down on him, Hawkeye fired off arrows as swiftly as he could, destroying multiple robots across the city. However, the ongoing fight against Ultron's massive army of robots had taken its toll as Hawkeye had dived for cover, complaining about the amount of pain he was in before another onslaught of Sentries arrived.

Hawkeye witnesses Wanda Maximoff return
Just as he became overpowered by the great number of Sentries that had him completely surrounded, Hawkeye's words proved effective as Maximoff stepped out of the door and rejoined him, destroying the robots with ease and confidence while he looked on. With Maximoff having finally gained his faith, Hawkeye called Captain America over the radio to tell him they had just cleared the area and learned that he was currently being overwhelmed at the bridge.

Hawkeye humoring shooting at Quicksilver
Hawkeye and Maximoff began to make their way to the bridge to assist the rest of the Avengers, but before they could get back there, Quicksilver took his sister into his arms and ran to the center of the city, mocking Hawkeye by calling him an "old man" and telling him to keep up. Irritated, Hawkeye then aimed his bow at Quicksilver as he jokingly considered shooting him, thinking no one would know since he could blame the speedster's death on Ultron, before jogging after them.

Reinforcements
Hawkeye being reunited with Black Widow
Hawkeye eventually made his way to the middle of Novi Grad, where he reunited with Black Widow who had managed to escape from her imprisonment. As Hawkeye took off his jacket, he gave Black Widow her weapons to fight. Hawkeye had then informed them that if the city got any higher the people would start collapsing. Captain America ordered Wanda Maximoff to help get all the people hiding in the city out and Hawkeye told him that he would watch her back.

Hawkeye helping the evacuation of Novi Grad
While the first wave of Ultron Sentries was pushed back, the team's attention turned to how they would get the people to safety without destroying the city. Suddenly, Nick Fury and Maria Hill arrived on a Helicarrier and sent in Lifeboats to bring all the citizens to safety. Hawkeye and Wanda Maximoff took charge of the operation to load the people onto the Lifeboats while Iron Man and War Machine were both then ordered to protect them from more Ultron Sentries.

Protecting the Key
Hawkeye and the Avengers face Ultron's army
Hawkeye rejoined Wanda Maximoff and Quicksilver at the center of Novi Grad as they regrouped with the other members of the Avengers. As everybody had arrived, Iron Man explained to the team that they had to protect the device's key from Ultron, since activating the key would cause the city to drop out of the sky, all while Ultron had gathered his entire army just outside the church, which completely surrounded the Avengers.

Hawkeye battles the army of Ultron Sentries
As Hawkeye watched on, Ultron mocked the Avengers by claiming that having them all gathered in one place to face him was exactly what he had wanted. When Thor had furiously taunted him about the size of his army, Ultron responded by unleashing his entire army of the Ultron Sentries upon the Avengers and Hawkeye joined his team in putting all his energy in fighting against the seemingly unstoppable army of evil robots, firing his arrows as fast as he possibly could.

Hawkeye overpowering Ultron's entire army
Despite doing his best to keep these Sentries at bay by shooting his many trick arrows at them, Hawkeye was forced to resort to hand to hand combat as he threw his bow aside and began using his arrows as his melee weapons to overpower the robot army. Before long, the combined might of the Avengers pushed the army of Ultron Sentries back and with combined efforts of the Vision, Iron Man, Thor as well as Hulk had destroyed Ultron's armor and sent him fleeing.

Hawkeye discusses protecting Ultron's core
With Novi Grad rising ever so higher, Captain America then ordered the team to fall back before the city could be destroyed in the sky to keep it from falling down to the surface of the Earth and wiping out all of humanity as Ultron planned. Hawkeye questioned what would be done to protect the key, which Maximoff vowed to protect it, noting that it was her job to do so, repeating the words Hawkeye had said to her earlier. Hawkeye nodded and then made his escape.

Rival Turned Savior
Hawkeye and Black Widow driving to safety
With little time to spare, Hawkeye and Black Widow stole a car and drove to the Lifeboats ready to be taken to safety. As they drove along, Hawkeye explained his plans to rework his home by fixing up the dining room to make more room inside for his children to play. As they parked, they overheard Hulk's roar and Black Widow went to calm him down and bring him to safety.

Hawkeye searches for a lost child
While Black Widow was speaking with Hulk, Hawkeye had finally made it onboard one of the boats and attempted to leave Novi Grad behind. However, as Hawkeye briefly paused in order to check that nobody was left behind in the city, he then heard the cries of a young woman whose brother was still missing somewhere in the city, as Hawkeye knew that he had to help and ran back to the remains of the city to find him and bring him to safety before it was too late.

Hawkeye protecting a young boy from Ultron
Before long, Hawkeye had managed to find the young boy trapped underneath the rubble and had managed to free him as he lifted the child up in order to bring him back to the Lifeboat. However, just as Hawkeye picked up the child, the Avengers found themselves under fire by Ultron who had stolen the Quinjet. Ultron then aimed directly at Hawkeye and the young boy in his arms, mercilessly firing a hail of bullets at them.

Hawkeye's life being saved by Quicksilver
Seeing no way out, Hawkeye tried to use his body to shield the boy from harm, but, as a dash of wind went by, they found that none of the bullets had struck them. Hawkeye looked up to see that they had all hit Quicksilver, who had run into the line of fire to save Hawkeye and was fatally wounded. Quicksilver told Hawkeye with a smile that he did not see that coming before falling down. Captain America ran over to their aid but Hawkeye confirmed that Quicksilver was dead.

Hawkeye is finally able to get out of Sokovia
Hawkeye had ensured that the boy was reunited with his sister and Captain America then carried Quicksilver's body on the Lifeboat. Hawkeye refused medical attention as he claimed to be fine, as he then laid down beside his savior, exhausted by the battle. Moments later, Ultron activated the key and the city began to descend, only to be destroyed by Iron Man and Thor, saving billions of lives. Shortly afterwards, the final Ultron Sentry had been destroyed by the Vision, finally ending the war.

Retirement with Family
Barton returns home to his wife and children
Having promised his wife during the Ultron Offensive, Barton retired from the Avengers and returned home to his family. Soon after, Laura Barton had given birth to their son, Nathaniel Pietro Barton, who had been named after Natasha Romanoff and Pietro Maximoff. Later, the Bartons sent a video for Romanoff to show off their newborn while she was working at the New Avengers Facility.

Barton shares a loving hug with Laura Barton
During his retirement, Barton played golf with his spare time, always hitting a hole-in-one due to his incredible marksmanship. Barton also would plan a waterskiing trip for his kids to go on around mid-2016. Nearly a year later, Barton had been informed by Romanoff about the new Sokovia Accords, a registration document created for enhanced individuals. When asked about signing, Barton told Romanoff that he was retired, allowing him to not need to sign these Accords.

Avengers Civil War
Rescue of Wanda Maximoff
Hawkeye breaks into the Avengers Facility
During his retirement, Barton was called by Steve Rogers, who had become a fugitive due to defying the Sokovia Accords, and asked Barton to help rescue Wanda Maximoff from the New Avengers Facility where Tony Stark had told the Vision to supervise her. Upon arriving at the facility, Hawkeye set off an explosion which distracted Vision while he got in. However, Maximoff had sensed a presence behind her, causing her to launch a knife towards the intruder.

Hawkeye preparing to entrap the Vision
Fortunately, Maximoff saw it was Hawkeye and stopped the blade inches from his head, as Hawkeye pushed the knife away and joked that he should have knocked. Maximoff then asked what Hawkeye was doing here, to which he claimed to be disappointing his kids. Hawkeye shot his Trap Arrows on both sides of the room and told Maximoff they had to go as Rogers currently needed their help, taking Maximoff's hand as they then attempted to leave.

Vision stops Hawkeye and Wanda Maximoff
Before they could get out, however, Vision returned to the room as he told Hawkeye that he should not be in there to which Hawkeye joked that he had retired for five minutes and it all went to shit. While Vision started to approach Hawkeye and Maximoff, as he told Hawkeye to consider the consequences of his actions before he was stunned due to Hawkeye's electrical arrows. With Vision incapacitated, Hawkeye started to leave, knowing that it would not hold him for long.

Hawkeye tries to motivate Wanda Maximoff
However, as he went towards the exit while they still could, Hawkeye had then noticed Maximoff's hesitancy to leave as she stayed in the same spot, with Hawkeye becoming frustrated as he turned back to attempt to convince her to leave. Maximoff, however, then explained how she felt guilty following the fight against Crossbones earlier that week and felt that she should stay in their facility, to which Hawkeye mockingly told her to go back to school if she wanted to mope.

Hawkeye desperately trying to fight Vision
Telling Maximoff that if she wanted to make amends for her previous mistake while fighting Crossbones then she needed to get off her ass as Hawkeye attempted to get her to leave. However, before he could, Vision used the Mind Stone to escape the electrical bondage. He approached Hawkeye, who fired an arrow, but that phased through Vision. Vision then knocked Hawkeye away, with the now frustrated Hawkeye responding by noting that he should have stretched first.

Hawkeye readying himself for their next fight
Seeking to use any weapon he could, Hawkeye had then equipped himself with his collapsible baton and prepared to fight the android. All of Hawkeye's attacks were countered by Vision's ability to phase around objects. Hawkeye attempted to punch Vision several times in the head, but his attack was useless due to Vision's Vibranium skin. Hawkeye soon became overpowered by Vision, who broke his baton and captured him in a headlock which he could not escape from.

Hawkeye being almost subdued by the Vision
Vision then calmly stated to Hawkeye that he could not really defeat him, to which Hawkeye had agreed and noted that Maximoff could. Maximoff told Vision to let Hawkeye go and that she was choosing to leave, while Vision told Maximoff that he could not let her. Maximoff proceeded to use her powers to control the Mind Stone in Vision's forehead and forced him to phase, which released Hawkeye and then caused Vision to fall to his knees by increasing his density.

Hawkeye and Wanda Maximoff escape
While Hawkeye recovered from their fight, he watched as Maximoff then pushed Vision several stories through the ground. Having taken a moment to look at the crater left by their battle where Vision could no longer be found, Hawkeye and Maximoff left the New Avengers Facility. The pair then had to make one final stop on their way to help build up Captain America's team by recruiting Scott Lang, who had been recommended to join their Avengers team by Sam Wilson.

Recruiting Scott Lang
Barton reunites with Steve Rogers in Berlin
Arriving there first, Barton and Wanda Maximoff waited for the arrival of Steve Rogers in Berlin as they arranged to meet in a quiet parking complex where nobody would see them. When Rogers arrived, the two friends reunited as he told Barton that he would not have called him if there were any other choices,

Barton and Steve Rogers discuss the situation
But Barton insisted that he was doing him a favor, noting that he owed Maximoff a debt following the death of Quicksilver. When Rogers thanked Maximoff for rejoining them, she quoted back what Barton had said to her back at their New Avengers Facility about how she needed to get off her ass and make amends for her past mistakes, which Barton had simply smiled about.

Barton introduces Scott Lang to Steve Rogers
When Rogers then asked about Scott Lang, who was asleep in their van, Barton woke him up and introduced him to Rogers, much to the amazement of Lang. They all then discussed the Winter Soldiers who were under the control of Helmut Zemo. As they prepared to leave, they then heard the airport was being evacuated by Tony Stark. The group then suited up and made their way into the airport where they would depart to Siberia before Iron Man could stop any of them.

Clash of the Avengers
Hawkeye and Wanda Maximoff standing by
As their plan went into effect, Captain America and his team headed to the Leipzig-Halle Airport where they had a helicopter waiting to take them to Siberia. However, almost immediately Captain America got surrounded by Iron Man's team, as Spider-Man stole his shield and webbed his hands. Hawkeye, who had taken a position inside the airport with Wanda Maximoff, waited for his perfect opportunity and then shot one of his arrows, which cut straight through the webs on Captain America's hands and the Avengers began fighting.

Hawkeye and Wanda Maximoff avoid explosions
While many other members of the team were being located and then confronted, Hawkeye attempted to get Maximoff out of the danger zone. However, while the pair of them were running towards a newer safe spot, Iron Man quickly located and went after the pair of them and fired several missiles near them, causing some large explosions which blocked their path, forcing them to stop. Hawkeye protected Maximoff from the flames as Iron Man confronted them.

Hawkeye being confronted by Iron Man
Having caught them, Hawkeye watched while Iron Man told Maximoff she may have hurt the Vision's feelings when she had escaped from their New Avengers Facility, which she denied while Iron Man insisted he locked her there to protect her. Iron Man then joked about Hawkeye coming out of retirement while Hawkeye stated that he had played eighteen holes of golf and had managed to get eighteen holes in one, noting that he simply had not been able to miss once.

Hawkeye fires his multiple arrows at Iron Man
With Iron Man briefly distracted by their conversation, Hawkeye had then fired a few arrows at him, only for Iron Man to dodge and easily destroyed them all. Unimpressed by the shots, Iron Man commented that this seemed to be the first time that Hawkeye had missed, only for Hawkeye to note that he had made Iron Man look behind him as he revealed that he was just distracting him so Maximoff could drop a bunch of cars on top of him from the car park, which allowed them both to then get away while Iron Man was still trapped.

Fighting Former Comrades
Hawkeye alongside Captain America's team
While the conflict continued, Hawkeye and Wanda Maximoff managed to make their way back to Captain America and his team, so they could get to the Quinjet that would take them to Siberia. As their team ran together, Hawkeye spotted the Quinjet up ahead, but they were then stopped by Vision who shot a laser beam from the Mind Stone in front of them. Vision warned them to surrender as the rest of Iron Man's team regrouped. However, Captain America then told his group to fight regardless.

Hawkeye manages to pin down Black Widow
The battle between the Avengers began with the two teams charging at each other, Hawkeye firing several trick arrows at his former allies as one of his arrows managed to incapacitate Vision as Hawkeye had aimed his other arrows at Iron Man and Spider-Man. Hawkeye and Black Widow then started to fight. He had managed to throw Black Widow to the ground, she questioned if they were still friends, which he had jokingly claimed that it depended on how hard she hit him.

Hawkeye being assisted by the Wanda Maximoff
As their clash still continued, Black Widow had then finally managed to get the upper hand due to Hawkeye holding back all his punches. Taking advantage of Hawkeye's unwillingness to really hurt her, Black Widow threw him off her and attempted to kick him in the head, only for Maximoff to save Hawkeye and then knock her out with her telekinetic powers, telling off Hawkeye for holding back. As the battle raged on, Hawkeye continued to fight against Iron Man's team.

Hawkeye about to fire Ant-Man on an arrow
As Falcon was being attacked by Iron Man while they flew over the airport, Hawkeye teamed up with Ant-Man to assist their ally, firing one of his arrows with Ant-Man riding on it so he was able to crawl inside and disable Iron Man's armor from the inside. As planned, the arrow broke apart into several, smaller arrows, but was destroyed by Iron Man's repulsor blast, while Ant-Man had managed to then jump off the arrow, land on top of Iron Man and crawl inside his suit.

Hawkeye continues firing arrows at Iron Man
While Ant-Man was still disabling the suit from the inside, Hawkeye had continued to fire more of his arrows in order to distract Iron Man while Ant-Man continued doing his work. Right as he prepared to fire back at Hawkeye, Iron Man's armor started to malfunction due to everything that Ant-Man had been doing, as Hawkeye made his way to his next fight as F.R.I.D.A.Y. had been able to locate Ant-Man and had then managed to harmlessly eject him out from the armor.

Winning a Losing Battle
Hawkeye telling Captain America their plan
As team Iron Man pressed in, Falcon had finally realized they could not win the battle and get everyone to Siberia. While he was dodging an attack by War Machine, Hawkeye commented that some of them would have to stay behind and fight in order for Captain America and Bucky Barnes to get to the Quinjet. As the team made their way to the getaway vehicle, they discussed how to best distract Iron Man during the escape.

Hawkeye fighting against the Black Panther
In an attempt to cause a distraction so some of their team could get away, Ant-Man transformed into Giant-Man, causing chaos around the airport which allowed Captain America and Barnes to get away unseen. While Giant-Man fought against Iron Man and War Machine, Hawkeye then faced-off against Black Panther in order to distract their enemies from noticing the escaping pair, with Hawkeye firing arrows at Black Panther who managed to simply avoid them.

Hawkeye introduces himself to Black Panther
Hawkeye shot another two arrows at the closing in Black Panther, but he managed to catch these arrows in mid-air before they exploded in his face, with his Panther Habit absorbing the explosions. Knowing that archery was not the best for face-to-face conflict, Hawkeye put away his bow and transformed it into a bo staff, before introducing himself to T'Challa, who claimed to not care. Resuming the attack, Hawkeye continued to distract Black Panther.

Hawkeye being outmatched by Black Panther
Hawkeye managed to hold his own briefly but was defeated as Black Panther struck him in the face, broke his staff, and was knocked out, allowing Black Panther then chase down Captain America and Barnes. Due to all of the efforts of Hawkeye and Giant-Man, Captain America and Barnes had boarded the Quinjet and escape, despite the efforts of Vision and Black Panther. However, despite the team's success, all of Captain America's allies were then arrested.

Imprisoned in the Raft
Barton greets Tony Stark while inside the Raft
Following the Clash of the Avengers, Barton and all the other heroes who supported Captain America were captured and taken to the Raft, where they were imprisoned for their role in destroying the airport and defying the Sokovia Accords by impeding Bucky Barnes' arrest. When Tony Stark visited, Barton sarcastically applauded his arrival, taunting that "the Futurist" had just arrived. Stark noted the Raft was built for criminals, to which Barton angrily claimed they were all now because of Stark trying to bring them down.

Barton begins to mock Tony Stark's ideals
Barton then noted how he, Sam Wilson and Wanda Maximoff had all become criminals now. However, Stark refused to take Barton's bait, casually replying that he did not make the former Avengers readily break the law, his calm attitude at his former friends being imprisoned enraging Barton. Stark pointed out Barton should have thought of his family before he chose to join Captain America and walked off, furthering angering Barton with his dismissal.

Barton calling out Tony Stark for his actions
As Stark walked to Wilson's cell, Barton slammed on his cell wall and warned his friends to watch their back, as Stark was likely to break it; emphasizing his anger at his former teammate and making a clear reference to James Rhodes being seriously injured during their clash. The Avengers leader, however, did not turn to look back at Barton for the remainder of his visit while he spoke with Wilson, also choosing to ignore Scott Lang as Lang then tried to insult him.

Barton continues his imprisonment in the Raft
Unwilling to let his friends be imprisoned, Steve Rogers returned and infiltrated the Raft to free Barton and the others. While they celebrated their freedom, Barton decided to officially retire from the Avengers in order to care for his family. Barton and Lang had then made deals with the FBI to be placed under house arrest and agree to follow the Sokovia Accords as Thaddeus Ross demanded, with Barton returning to his Homestead until his house arrest was complete so he could live a peaceful life.

Ronin
Losing Everything
Barton teaching his daughter archery
In 2018, Barton, who was still under house arrest, was having a picnic with his family outside of his homestead. While Laura prepared lunch and his sons played catch, Barton was teaching his daughter Lila archery. Barton guided Lila in how to shoot an arrow, a skill he had perfected, as his wife called out for what condiment they wanted on their hot dogs: mayonnaise or mustard. Barton requested mustard for the two of them, joking with Lila how only her brothers preferred mayonnaise on hot dogs.

Barton compliments his daughter's shooting
Barton then watched as Lila took her shot, hitting the bullseye. He proudly congratulated his daughter, calling her "Hawkeye". As Lila went to collect her arrow, Laura called them over for lunch. When Barton called for his daughter, he discovered that she was gone. Barton called out for Lila again, wondering where she had gone, but to no prevail. Confused by his daughter's sudden disappearance, Barton turned to where his wife and sons were, only to find them gone too.

Barton discovers his daughter has vanished
Starting to get very worried, Barton began to unsuccessfully search for his family around the homestead, unaware of what was happening. Barton could do nothing but desperately, and with great fear, call out for his family. Barton would eventually learn in complete horror that his wife and children actually perished alongside half of the universe's population, all thanks to Thanos obtaining the six Infinity Stones to commit the Snap, despite the best efforts of the Avengers to stop him.

Barton sees his whole family disappearing
Even when the other Avengers were able to successfully track down Thanos to the Garden several weeks later, it became all for naught as Thanos had already destroyed the Infinity Stones, before Thor proceeded to behead him with Stormbreaker, leaving the Avengers in utter defeat as they could not reverse the Snap without the Infinity Stones' power. This left Barton completely devastated, as any hope of saving his family appeared to be lost forever, due to the complete destruction of the Infinity Stones and the death of Thanos.

Massacre in Tokyo
Ronin slaughters all of his many enemies
As a result of losing his family, Barton had embraced his grief and became Ronin, going on a path of vengeance against any criminals who had survived the Snap. Using a new uniform and weaponry, including a Katana, Ronin travelled to Mexico where he ruthlessly murdered all members of Mexican Cartel. This resulted in Ronin being sought out by the remaining Avengers, as James Rhodes continued investigating Ronin's actions.

Ronin furiously fighting against Akihiko
Ronin then found himself in Tokyo, Japan, where he planned to eliminate all members of the Yakuza faction there. Despite the great numbers and rapid gunfire, Ronin managed to make his way through all enemies with great ease, going through a building where he headed for Akihiko, a Yakuza operative. The two then found themselves in the streets, where Akihiko questioned Ronin on his actions, which he informed him that it was the fact they survived and half the population didn't. The two then drew swords and began to fight.

Ronin after murdering Akihiko with his sword
Despite the duel being fairly even, Ronin was able to cut Akihiko's throat, causing him to beg for his life, promising to give Ronin anything he wanted. However, Ronin ignored his cries for mercy, stating that the only thing he wanted, which was his family, could not be given by Akihiko. He then finished off Akihiko, cleaned his sword, as he became aware of Romanoff standing behind him, telling her that she should not be there.

But Romanoff believed that he should not either, but Barton informed her that it was all a part of a job that he believed he had to do. Romanoff addressed how everyone he has murdered was not going to bring his family back, for which she then informed him a plan to bring everyone back. However, despite desperately wanting to be with his family, Barton initially rejected the idea, not wanting to be given hope, only for it to be taken away if it failed.

Barton being comforted by Natasha Romanoff
Romanoff, clearly seeing her best friend in distraught and what he had become, apologized for not giving hope to him sooner. She then comforted him by holding his hand. The two then entered the Quinjet and flew back to the New Avengers Facility, in order to attempt to undo the actions of the Snap.

Time Heist
Testing Time Travel
Barton volunteering himself to test Time Travel
With Scott Lang giving the idea to use the Quantum Realm to travel back in time, the Avengers began to work on a way to successfully do so. Barton watched as Lang prepared to test the time traveling, to see if it actually worked. However, after an accidental triggering of one of the last available Pym Particles, Lang stated that he couldn't do it. Barton then volunteered to do the test run and switched with Lang. Nebula then helped Barton into the Advanced Tech Suit as Bruce Banner instructed him on some experiences he may have during the test.

As they prepared, Rhodes and Lang expressed their thoughts on time travel, believing that changing the past changes the future, something Barton supported. However, Banner tried to explain how time travel actually worked, debunking all the examples of time travel seen in movies that Rhodes and Lang listed, stating that them going into the past is their future, and the present would be their past, which couldn't be changed by the new future.

Barton at his house in the past
Barton stood on the platform and waited to be transported through time, via the Quantum Realm. Banner counted down to when he activated the machine, causing Barton to be sent into the Quantum Realm. Barton navigated his way through, coming out at his home, before the Snap. Barton took a moment to adjust to being back in the past, before approaching his house, where he picked up a baseball mitt. He then overheard his children, causing him to call out to his daughter to try and see her again. However, he was sent back to the present just before he could, narrowly missing his daughter.

Barton successfully returns from the past
When he returned, he was temporarily discomforted by the travel, but quickly adjusted. Natasha Romanoff went to check on him and see if he was fine, which he told her he was. He then informed the Avengers that their plan had worked, and he had successfully traveled through time, as he had brought the mitt back with him. He threw the mitt to Tony Stark and they all began to brainstorm about the Infinity Stones. Through this experience, Barton was given hope again, and was now back to himself, although the Ronin identity still stuck with him.

Locating the Infinity Stones
Barton and James Rhodes listen to Thor
With the means of travel accounted for, the team then began brainstorming when and where they could retrieve the stones, addressing that they need to be specific where they travel to, as the stones have all crossed paths with most of them. They decided to brief themselves on each stone and the history of where they've been. Thor told them about the Aether, but began to get off topic as he had not come to terms with some of the trauma in his life, including his mother's death. 

Barton listens to Nebula talk about Vormir
Rocket Raccoon then informed them about the Power Stone, which Peter Quill stole from Morag, and Nebula told them about the Soul Stone, and how Thanos also killed her sister there, too. They then refined their plan to retrieve all six stones the best way possible, as there was a time when three stones were on Earth at once. They then split the Avengers into small teams, each responsible for a different stone. 

The Avengers finish the Time Heist brainstorm
They assigned three teams: Stark, Steve Rogers, Banner and Lang going to 2012 to get the Space Stone, Mind Stone and Time Stone, Thor and Rocket to 2013 to get the Reality Stone, and Barton and Romanoff were tasked with retrieving the Soul Stone, which they would do by going to Vormir in 2014 with Rhodes and Nebula, who would go to Morag to get the Power Stone. However, they only had enough Pym Particles to send them back in time, and back to the present, meaning this was their only chance.

Retrieving the Soul Stone

The Avengers all then suited up in their Advanced Tech Suits and made their way to the platform, where Captain America gave them a speech about everything that had led up to that moment and how this was their only opportunity to change what had happened.

Hawkeye and Black Widow prepare to leave
Hawkeye was given a shrunken down Benatar to take with him so he and Black Widow could travel to Vormir, which Rocket Raccoon made him promise to return without any damages, which Barton casually agreed to. Bruce Banner then activated the machine and they all were transported to the Quantum Realm, where they each traveled to their designated time.

Hawkeye and Black Widow on Morag in 2014
Hawkeye, Black Widow, War Machine and Nebula all successfully arrived in 2014 on Morag, where they enlarged the Benatar and waited for Nebula to lower the Benatar's Space Pod. Hawkeye and Black Widow then boarded the Benatar and said goodbye to War Machine, who asked them to watch over each other. They then departed Morag and headed to Vormir, to retrieve the Soul Stone.

Hawkeye and Black Widow travelling in space
As they traveled to Vormir, which Nebula had set the coordinates for, making their only requirement to not fall out of course, the two best friends enjoyed the sight of space travel. They laughed with each other as Hawkeye mentioned that they had come a long way since being S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, mentioning their mission in Budapest. While the ship was on autopilot, the two had a deep conversation about their relationship.

Hawkeye and Black Widow locate Red Skull
They soon arrived at the planet, which amazed Hawkeye, saying that what they were doing would be awesome if not for the circumstances. They then made their way through the planet, climbing up the mountain, which they found to be exhausting. When Black Widow called Rocket a "Raccoon", Hawkeye stated that technically he was not a raccoon, but she didn't care. When they made it to the top of the mountain, they were greeted by the Red Skull, who alarmed them, causing them to draw their weapons at him.

Hawkeye learning the cost for the Soul Stone
The Red Skull informed them that he was a guide for those seeking the Soul Stone, so Black Widow demanded that he show them where it was. However, he informed them that it is never that simple. They learned that the stone was at the bottom of the cliff, and then the Red Skull told them that they had to make a sacrifice of what they love for the Soul Stone.

Losing his Best Friend
Hawkeye questions if the sacrifice is real
Upon learning about the price to pay for the Soul Stone, Hawkeye and Black Widow took a moment to let the severity of the situation sink in. Hawkeye felt as if the Red Skull may be lying, but Black Widow believed that he was not and that a sacrifice is necessary.

Hawkeye deciding to sacrifice his own life
She considered how Thanos arrived on Vormir and did not leave with Gamora, believing it not to be a coincidence with their current predicament. They then repeated what Captain America had said before their mission "whatever it takes", before accepting that one of them needed to sacrifice themselves for the stone. Hawkeye decided that he would make the sacrifice, holding Black Widow's hand to comfort her in their final moments.

Hawkeye and Black Widow discuss sacrifice
However, she then reciprocated the same gesture, making him realize that she intended on sacrificing herself. They then argued over which one it should be, neither wanting to willingly let the other die. Black Widow attempted to make her case, saying this is what she had been working towards all these years, and that she did not want Hawkeye to die. However, Hawkeye told her he should do it, as he saw himself as too far gone, which she assured him that he is more than his worst moments.

Hawkeye and Black Widow share an embrace
However, when he told her that she should not try and give him a chance, she responded to the fact that he did for her when they first met. They then took a moment to embrace each other's friendship, resting their heads on one another, until Hawkeye took her off guard and threw her down so he could sacrifice himself. He told her to tell his family when they were brought back, that he loved them. 

Hawkeye jumps off the cliff to sacrifice himself
However, Black Widow gained the upper hand and threw him down, deciding to make the sacrifice herself. She hit him with her Bite, causing him to get shocked. As she made a run for the cliff, Hawkeye ripped off the taser, drew his bow, and fired an explosive arrow near her, causing her to be thrown away from the cliff. He then made it for the cliff and jumped off, but Black Widow also jumped and grabbed him, shooting a grapple and attaching it to him, so he wouldn't fall, sacrificing herself.

Hawkeye watches Black Widow's sacrifice
However, Hawkeye was able to grab onto her, but could not pull her up, without both of them falling. He got mad at her for stopping him from sacrificing himself. She asked him to let her go, knowing that there was no other way, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. He desperately tried to get her to not do it, not letting go of her, as he did not want his best friend to die, but she felt the exact same and forced him to let go. Hawkeye cried as he watched Black Widow fall to her death, helpless to do anything else.

Hawkeye manages to obtain the Soul Stone
With the required sacrifice being made, a light burst out and knocked Hawkeye out and teleporting him to a river. Hawkeye soon awoke, confused on the new area he suddenly appeared in, sitting up in the water. He had obtained the Soul Stone, which appeared in his hand, but at that moment, all that he was thinking about was the death of his best friend. As he sat in the river, Hawkeye cried over her death.
