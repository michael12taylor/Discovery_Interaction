<html><p>Psionics: As a result of exposure to the cosmic energies from the Scepter, which contained the Mind Stone, Maximoff gained an array of psionic powers. These powers manifest as a luminescent mist or vapor of red hue emanating from her hands and body, resembling the natural Chaos Magic she was born with. When using her telepathic abilities, Maximoff's irises glow a dark red color. Her power signature is similar to that of the Mind Stone, as she gained her powers from it. Maximoff's powers are reliant on movement and focus, which means her enemies or opponents can stop her from using her powers by disrupting her concentration or restricting her movement. War Machine was able to incapacitate her momentarily using a sonic cannon and her powers were restricted with a straitjacket and specialized collar during her time on the Raft. During the Battle of Wakanda, Proxima Midnight was able to ambush Maximoff by striking her on the head with the hilt of her sword, which disrupted Maximoff's focus and stopped her from using her powers momentarily. During the Battle of Earth, Wanda's powers had grown so strong that she was able to single-handedly overpower Thanos, a feat that Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America via Mjølnir failed to accomplish. These enhanced powers, much like her Chaos Magic, are magical in nature.
Psionic Energy Manipulation:      Maximoff generating psionic energy   Maximoff can project energy blasts, streams, waves and bolts of her own psionic and telekinetic energy, allowing her to strike, push, pull or blow away her targets, potentially exerting enough force to destroy them. This energy manifests in any shape or form, outlining her telekinetic spheres of influence, as the energy is visible in a reddish color. When her energy hits a target, she can use her telekinesis to inflict further damage. Significant emotional turmoil can both amplify Maximoff’s power and causes her to lose control over it, such as when she inadvertently unleashed a wave of red psionic force that tore apart and disintegrated surrounding Ultron sentries when she sensed her brother Pietro Maximoff's death, letting out a scream of anguish. Maximoff proved herself capable of destroying the Mind Stone, due to her powers having a similar energy signature. She could also use her psionic energy streams to enhance the powers behind her attacks, such as when she first used her telekinesis to bring Vision to his knees and then use a dense stream of energy to force him through several floors and several feet into the ground. During the attack on Vision, Maximoff utilized this power to knock back Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive using a bolt of psionic energy, and later used another blast to throw Corvus Glaive through the wall of a bell tower. She also showed the capability of multitasking while using her abilities, as she simultaneously held back Thanos with a stream from one hand while destroying the Mind Stone with a stream of energy from her other hand. She was also able to use her telekinesis with one hand to stop Thanos' sword in midair while also using a powerful energy blast with her other hand to cleave it into two pieces. In her second encounter with Thanos, Maximoff's energy blasts were powerful enough to force the Mad Titan to go on the defensive against her and were enough to knock him back and make him stumble backwards even when he blocked them with his sword. Maximoff was also able to push Monica Rambeau out of her reality with a powerful energy blast that sent her through several walls, including the barrier that divides Westview from the outside world; while leaving Rambeau completely physically unharmed and send "Pietro Maximoff" flying with a powerful blast. She accidentally used her powers to nearly suffocate the entire population of Westview when she was overwhelmed by her emotions and later to throw away reanimated witches from her while she was trapped in Harkness's hallucination. She can also utilize her psionic energy in a neurological way to manipulate the thoughts and memories of others, akin to telepathy. Her psionic energy is capable of persisting even when she is no longer actively controlling it, such as when residual energy persisted and clung to the S.W.O.R.D. drone she destroyed. Agatha Harkness' runes were able to not only strip Wanda of her chaos magic, but her psionic energy as well.
Telekinesis: Maximoff has the ability to move, levitate and otherwise manipulate objects using her psionic energy in a remote manner without the need for her energy to first be projected from her hands. Maximoff uses this energy to affect and control molecules and particles, allowing her to fully control matter and energy. Maximoff started training this power by moving wooden blocks around while imprisoned in Wolfgang von Strucker's secret facility. Maximoff pulled them apart with her power, and suspended them in the air. Maximoff used this power to stop an off-rail train in Seoul, tear apart Ultron sentries and rip out the central processor of Ultron's primary body, which was made of vibranium. Maximoff's telekinesis can control a soldier's gunfire and throw him away, lift Captain America into the air to enter a building, hurl aside Black Widow and Black Panther, hurl cars at Iron Man and Spider-Man, extract and dissipate an enormous amount of gas, and even hold up a collapsed watchtower for several minutes to allow Captain America and Bucky to escape. Maximoff was also capable of using her energy to slow the chemical reaction within Crossbones' explosive vest by reducing the particles' kinetic energy on a molecular level, although it caused her great strain due to the massive energy the reaction induced once it had started. She was even able to bring the immensely powerful Vision to his knees while influencing the Mind Stone in his forehead and blast him vertically down through a building's many floors. Her telekinesis is powerful enough to bend vibranium, as she managed to rip open the chest of Ultron's damaged primary body to summon his central processor to her hand, and was even strong enough to shatter the Mind Stone. She was also able to stop a massive line of Threshers and redirect them at Thanos' Outriders, as well as hold back a Chitauri Leviathan. During her second fight with Thanos, she lifted and flung large portions of debris at him. She then was able to use her telekinesis to hold back Thanos' sword even with the Titan using both of his arms in an attempt to overpower her, and was able to weaken its structural integrity, causing cracks to appear in it, before finally using an energy blast to cleave it in two. She then incapacitated him by lifting him into the air and began to squeeze his body, snapping off significant portions of his armor. She displayed great degrees of precision with her telekinesis, such as when she used it to heal Vision by telekinetically repairing his body on a molecular level. Maximoff was also precise enough to use her energy to remove a copious volume of poisonous gas by spreading her energy throughout every molecule of gas and making it dissipate into the atmosphere. Maximoff was able to use her telekinesis to organize the dishes in her kitchen, use it to help herself handle all the kitchen items while preparing a dinner, rebuild part of her house after having expelled Rambeau, lift Rambeau into the air to get her out of her house before dropping her to the ground, open a door in S.W.O.R.D. Headquarters, break the glass of a large window to access the lab where Vision's body was being disassembled, and hurl a car at Agatha. She also (inadvertently) strangled dozens of people at once.
Disintegration: Maximoff is capable of using her energy in such an acute telekinetic way that she is able to completely disintegrate objects, as she did with several Ultron Sentries after sensing her brother's death.
     Scarlet Witch creates a psionic force-field  Force-field Generation: Maximoff is able to create highly durable barriers of red energy that she can shape and manipulate as needed. She can use it to grab and break apart targets, protect others from enemy fire, contain a target or to cover and deflect attacks from enemies, such as Ultron's sentries. Like any physical barriers, the barrier could be broken with extreme brute force, as the Sentries were able to eventually break it. During her time as an Avenger, Maximoff learned to project her energy around herself, constructing a close-to-the-body psionic armor to protect herself from extreme impacts, such as falls from great heights or blows from superhumanly strong combatants, increasing her durability to a significant degree. This allowed her to land safely whenever she crash lands, as well as defending her against the might of superhuman combatants, such as Midnight and Glaive who sent her and Vision crashing through a glass roof after being shot down by Proxima Midnight's spear. Maximoff was also able to create a force field to protect her family from Agatha Harkness' attack and later created a barrier to prevent Vision from intervening during her duel with Agatha.
Flight: Maximoff is able to use this power to move through the air and simulate flight, in order to hover and safely float back to the ground. The use of this power manifests as a blast of psionic energy expelled from her hands onto the ground to propel herself up in the air, with a second blast used to slow her momentum as she approaches ground allowing her to land safely. It operates more like an enhanced leap similarly to Hulk, thanks to the force of gravity pushing her down. Maximoff's power grew over time to the point where she could project herself, along with Vision, far higher into the air and for much longer than before. After her resurrection and empowerment, she was able to effortlessly levitate several feet into the air while simultaneously lifting two massive pieces of rubble, no longer needing to actively project energy from her hands to levitate herself, and later flew through the air to intercept a Leviathan before it could attack Valkyrie. During her discussion with Vision, Maximoff was able to float merely by holding the psionic energy in her palms, and later showed the ability again upon leaving Westview, indicating growth in her ability to fly.
     Scarlet Witch manipulates Black Widow  Mental Manipulation: Maximoff was able to deploy a form of mental manipulation, often as a type of illusory hypnosis, using the same neuro-electric interface that is the basis of her telepathic powers. This power can be hypnotic in nature as shown when she used it against the Avengers in South Africa, placing them in a sort of trance while she viewed the Avengers' memories. When using her power, her irises sometimes glow a dark reddish color, especially when she concentrates it on specific targets. She was able to use this ability to cripple the Avengers, forcing them each to recall the darker events of their pasts and placing them inside daydream-like visions that rendered them nearly helpless. When this ability is in use, Maximoff's reddish energy takes a more mist-like form, floating into the head of the victim in the form of neurons. The effects also distort the victim's iris coloration, causing them to shine a dark reddish color. This also allows her to control other people's actions, as she did with a considerable number of civilians in Sokovia to aid in their evacuation, causing them to experience a form of sleepwalking and making them all get up and leave the city. Maximoff's mental power is even strong enough to reverse the effects of the Mind Stone, one of the most powerful objects in existence, as shown when she freed Helen Cho from the stone's control. She can also manipulate the memory, thoughts, actions, emotions, and senses of others at will, as well as to induce sleep or pain and create illusions without any difficulty. After joining the Avengers, she initially stopped using these powers, but later resumed their use after creating the Hex. Maximoff could use her telepathy to affect the Mind Stone, such as when she forced used her power to make Vision phase through Hawkeye to release him. Maximoff can also use her psionic energy to read the Mind Stone and state that she felt Vision's consciousness. Maximoff was able to use this power to cause several S.W.O.R.D. agents to point their guns at Tyler Hayward.
Emotional Manipulation: With her mental powers, Maximoff often used it in order to elicit fear or emotional pain in a person in the form of nightmarish hallucinations that could stun and weaken even an individual as powerful as Thor. These visions can depict things that a person fears, regrets, or general disturbances, though the nature of it is not up to Maximoff. She is able to know what her victim is seeing and be inside the vision with them, as demonstrated when she used the ability on Harkness.
Telepathy: Due to her ability to interact mentally with others, Maximoff can read minds, communicate telepathically and experience the memories and thoughts of others. She also used this ability to temporarily see into Ultron's mind whilst he was uploading his consciousness into the android body of what would later become Vision and it was thanks to this that she was able to discover his genocidal intentions and rebel against him. Maximoff can also sense the minds and emotions of those around her as she could see Stark's fear in their first encounter and sensed Quicksilver's death, knowing exactly what happened to him as if she had been there in person. While her telepathic abilities could work inside the confines of Agatha's protection spell-ladened lair, she was unable to penetrate Agatha's mind due to the latter's own power.
Psionic Energy Manipulation:      Maximoff generating psionic energy   Maximoff can project energy blasts, streams, waves and bolts of her own psionic and telekinetic energy, allowing her to strike, push, pull or blow away her targets, potentially exerting enough force to destroy them.

While her telepathic abilities could work inside the confines of Agatha's protection spell-ladened lair, she was unable to penetrate Agatha's mind due to the latter's own power.
Master Sorceress: As revealed by Harkness, in addition to the psionic abilities granted by the Mind Stone, Maximoff was born with latent magical abilities that were later unlocked and amplified through her exposure to the Stone. At first, Maximoff had no knowledge of her magical origins, however, when she discovered the true extent of her powers, Maximoff began studying the Darkhold and the spells found within it. According to the Darkhold, Maximoff's powers exceeded even those of the Sorcerer Supreme. Despite this, Maximoff has never received formal training, and has not yet refined her magic, especially when compared to Doctor Strange.
Chaos Magic Manipulation:      Maximoff displaying her Chaos Magic   Able to harness Chaos Magic, Maximoff was the realization of the myth of the Scarlet Witch, a being capable of spontaneous creation. She can shape and manipulate this magic for different effects, such as forming tangible constructs of energy or cast spells without incantation. Her magic is primarily composed of the same red energy as her psionic powers, but mixed with darker red and black hues. At first, Maximoff had no control over this power, however, upon studying the Darkhold, Maximoff gained more experience in the control of her magic.
Reality Manipulation: Maximoff can warp reality. She accomplishes this by manipulating molecular polarity, allowing her numerous other capabilities. Maximoff's reality warping abilities began initially on a small scale, however, as time progressed, her powers have grown exponentially. Maximoff can also create small zones where reality follows her wishes and rules. The areas are surrounded by a partially invisible force field and appear normal from the outside, as when she took control of Westview the town looked normal from the outside even though the reality had completely changed inside. When a person or object enters the area, it automatically becomes part of the reality. Using this ability, Maximoff was able to take control of Westview by placing a hexagonal force field around the town called the Hex, which emits a type of radiation known as CMBR, a remnant radiation from the Big Bang. Inside the Hex, Maximoff has absolute power and can change anything to suit her thinking, being able to create a perfect world based on classic sitcoms, as well as use her powers to rewrite reality and make any person and any object adapt to the time in which they were live in Westview, demonstrated when she had Rambeau's bulletproof vest changed to fit the clothing of her world of classic sitcoms. In fact, every rewritten object inside the Hex, when it exits Westview, remains the same as it was inside, containing the same microscopic elements of their original forms. Due to the authentic sitcom setting, certain abilities also took on different forms within the Hex, such as the lack of energy discharge in the early eras, or the appearance of red smoke rather than energy when imitating Harkness's teleportation. This extended to Vision as well, whose powers were symbolized by the appearance of sparkles during the 1950s. The Hex could alter almost all aspects of reality, including the behavior, thoughts, and memories of the people living inside it, as well as the entire flow of time, all to Maximoff's will. However, inadvertently, the spell was flawed, which caused the suppressed consciousnesses of the Westview residents to still be capable of basic sentience, but removing their willpower. Essentially, they were aware of what they were doing, but were not capable of controlling their own actions. Additionally, every resident ended up feeling the same grief and sorrow Wanda felt over Vision. This was so emotionally taxing on them that it led to some residents becoming suicidal. Although at first the Hex was only found around Westview, when Vision came out of the barrier and nearly died, Maximoff expanded the Hex to save him, also causing everything in his path to be rewritten, transforming the S.W.O.R.D. base into a circus and its agents into clowns. The Hex is able to do this even if Wanda is not aware of it, as the Hex began to immediately disassemble Vision's vibranium body after he left, but Wanda was unaware of it happening. Due to the nature of the Hex, Harkness described it as "magic on autopilot" because the Hex was capable of rewriting reality to fit Wanda's vision automatically without Wanda needing to say any incantations or even having to think about it. However, the magic of the Hex does not seem to work on people or objects that have not passed through its border first, as when Hayward's troops entered the Hex, they weren't affected by it because they never passed through the Hex itself. After gaining more control of her power by transforming into the Scarlet Witch, Maximoff was able to make the Hex disappear completely, reversing the changes it caused to everything and everyone that were still inside.
Conjuration: With a wave of her finger she was able to create wedding rings for herself and Vision. During the magic show on Westview, Maximoff was able to conjure a small crane to cover up Vision's flight. Later on she was able to create a dog collar for Sparky. It was later revealed this was how she was able to conjure a copy of her deceased lover, Vision, within Westview with Chaos Magic, as well as creating an entire house for them to live in.
Life Creation: Within the Hex, Maximoff could create living organisms, like her twin sons Billy and Tommy, though they would be destroyed if they left the Hex.
Time Manipulation: Within the Hex, Wanda could control the passage of time for all of Westview, notably causing the time period within the town to change overnight and even accelerating the day and night cycle to fit the length of her sitcom episodes. Maximoff reverted a whole chicken into its egg form and later reversed the entire flow of time inside her reality by saying "no" in response to a S.W.O.R.D. agent crawling out of a sewer. While expanding the Hex to save Vision, Maximoff caused time in Westview to completely stop.
Teleportation: During the talent show she instantly transported Geraldine from backstage into the magic box. In her battle with Harkness, Maximoff was also able to disappear and reappear behind her, leaving behind a trail of red smoke as she did, imitating Harkness's own teleportation.
Transmutation: Maximoff was able to change her dress, transformed a real piano into a fake cardboard cutout, turned her and Vision's beds into a single bed, brought color to Westview and also brought fake butterflies on a mobile to life without meaning to. Maximoff was able to make herself four months pregnant inadvertently, and also caused her to give birth at a logarithmic rate. When dealing with pain from her contractions Maximoff inadvertently changed her coat several times and also accidentally brought life to a stork from a painting, however, when Maximoff tried to get rid of the stork, she was unsuccessful, as the most she could do was cause a puff of red dust to erupt around it. As her mental stability deteriorated, she further lost control of her surroundings, and began to inadvertently change objects in her home into versions from previous sitcom eras. While battling Agatha Harkness, Wanda used this ability to appear as if her life force had been drained by Agatha, including masking and hiding her psionic energy while flying in order to trick Harkness into thinking she had lost, when in actuality, she was preparing runes around the Hex to strip Harkness of  her magic. Once the Hex was reversed by Wanda, everything and everyone changed by it, provided they were still inside it, reverted back to their original forms, including the clothing Wanda herself was initially wearing when she inadvertently created it. Maximoff also can transform herself from her civilian clothes to her Scarlet Witch uniform and back at will.
Electricity Manipulation: Maximoff turned a light on and off with her hand and later, while experiencing contractions, Maximoff caused a power surge that intensified the light from a ceiling light and caused a power outage that affected the whole block.
Weather Manipulation: When Maximoff's water broke she caused a rainstorm to erupt within the Vision Residence. After the rain stopped, she generated intense winds to pour in from outside in order to dry herself, Vision, and her house.
Fire Manipulation: While experiencing contractions, Maximoff ignited a fire within the fireplace and caused it to intensify before dying down.
Water Manipulation: While experiencing contractions, Maximoff caused a faucet to spew water and a washing machine to overflow with water.
Protection Spell: Learned from Harkness, Maximoff used a protection spell via magic runes on the walls of the Hex that neutralized Harkness's magic, and revitalized Maximoff's own magic, even after having been drained of it.
Energy Absorption: Maximoff displayed the ability to absorb Agatha Harkness' Dark Magic and transform it into Chaos Magic, amplifying her own magic to an even greater extent. Unlike Harkness, who also needs to absorb life force in order to absorb magic from others, Maximoff is capable of absorbing magic and energy without killing her target.
Astral Projection: Unlike traditional astral projection, Maximoff was able to project her astral form without losing consciousness of her physical self. She accomplished this by manifesting the Scarlet Witch outside of her own body, as demonstrated when she studied the Darkhold in her astral form, whilst also brewing a cup of tea in her physical form.</p></html>
