<html><p>Despite the threat, however, Loki appeared to remain confident and mocked the Avengers throughout the interrogation, questioning how desperate Fury must be to bring together such a poor team together in order to stop him. Fury answered this by listing all of Loki's crimes, including threatening the Earth with war while killing innocent lives. Loki had mocked Fury by claiming that he had lost his chance to use the Tesseract to gain unlimited power and, although Fury had merely scoffed at the statement, making it clear that Loki no longer had any power, mocking him by offering a magazine as he walked away.

Fury discussing what Loki's schemes are
Having left Loki alone in his cell, Fury then rejoined the Avengers who were still discussing what Loki's true plans could be, finding Bruce Banner and Tony Stark discussing how Loki could use the Tesseract and harness its power for his own means. As they agreed to begin studying Loki's Scepter and how that worked, Fury then expressed his desire to understand how Loki had just recently used the Scepter to change both Hawkeye and Erik Selvig to his own personal slaves, while also making a comparison with the Flying Monkeys, which was a reference which Captain America was delighted to understand.

Fury speaks with Thor about Loki's schemes
Having discussed what Loki had said with the Avengers, Fury later spoke to Thor, who had been discussing Asgard's wars on Earth with agent Phil Coulson and commenting on how Loki's fury at him had resulted in him sending the Destroyer to Puente Antiguo and nearly killing several innocent lives. Fury asked Thor if he felt he could learn what Loki's plans were with the Tesseract, but Thor simply remained uncertain, as he told Fury that Loki's mind has snapped and he now not only wanted power but vengeance on him and his family for the slights against him since learning of the truth about his past.

Fury speaks with Thor about Loki's schemes
When Thor questioned what it was that Fury was asking him to do, fearing that he may soon be called upon to end his own brother's life, Fury, in turn, questioned what Thor was now prepared to do in order to keep the Earth safe from Loki's wrath. However, believing that they had gained the upper hand over him, Thor had then questioned what possible risk Loki could be to the Earth now that he was his prisoner onboard the Helicarrier, Fury instead then raised his concerns about Loki's seeming overconfidence and noted that he seemed glad to be on the ship unlike everybody else who was there with him.

Avengers Argument
Fury sees Tony Stark has hacked S.H.I.E.L.D.
As Fury sent Natasha Romanoff to interrogate Loki and trick him into giving away his schemes as she seemingly tried to bargain for Clint Barton's life, Fury was unaware of tensions between the Avengers as they searched for the Tesseract. Eventually, Fury learned of this as he saw a warning that the Helicarrier was now being hacked, allowing someone to access all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s top-secret documents and Fury had no doubt about which genius rogue was to blame.

Fury questions what Tony Stark is really doing
Angered by this, Fury then went to Tony Stark and Bruce Banner as he questioned what they were doing and why they were not trying to locate the Tesseract, only for Banner to explain how they had been doing that and figured out a system as they waited for the alert. Stark then completed his hack into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s systems as he had asked Fury what Phase 2 really was. However, just before Fury could then answer Stark's question, Captain America had then entered the room with a Arnimhilation 99L Assault Weapon which he had found, claiming that Phase Two was S.H.I.E.L.D. using the Tesseract to make weapons.

Fury defends his use of the HYDRA weapons
As Fury then attempted to defend his actions to Rogers by claiming that they had simply gathered everything they could on the Tesseract, he was interrupted by Stark who pulled up files proving that S.H.I.E.L.D. was indeed copying the HYDRA's designs in order to make Tesseract-powered weapons, which greatly angered Rogers. As they were joined by Romanoff and Thor Banner was asked to leave the room since they now believed that he could be getting manipulated by Loki, only for Banner to then demand to know what S.H.I.E.L.D.'s real intentions with the Tesseract were.

Fury explains why S.H.I.E.L.D. made weapons
Finally, Fury confessed that the weapons were being built due to the recent arrival of all the Asgardians, pointing to the Battle of Puente Antiguo in which Loki had sent down the Destroyer which had been proven to have considerably more strength than S.H.I.E.L.D. could currently handle. While Thor insisted that the Asgardians only wanted peace with the Earth, Fury noted that they were not the only beings out there who they could not match or control. Thor, however, claimed that Fury's use of the Tesseract had brought Loki there, claiming that it was a signal that the Earth was ready for a higher form of war.

Fury argues with all the Avengers over secrets
When Stark insulted Fury's attempt to use a nuclear deterrent to end the crisis, Fury remained him of how Stark Industries had made their billions from selling their weapons. This led to an intense argument with Rogers and Stark then debating the standards of being heroes, as Thor questioned Fury over whether or not Humans were more advanced than this, to which Fury had simply noted how they had never gone to Asgard and caused destruction, unlike Loki. While Banner claimed that the Avengers were a time bomb, Fury became concerned and recommended Banner step out of this situation.

Fury sees Bruce Banner almost losing control
Fury then watched as Rogers and Stark had continued their argument, until telling Romanoff to remove Banner from the room, leading to Banner becoming angry over the creation of a cell made to kill him, explaining that it was not possible to kill him, which he knew to attempt suicide previously. To their horror, the agitated Banner then picked up the Scepter as he had promised to explain his secret to remaining calm, as Rogers made him realize what was happening just as they got the signal on the Tesseract's location, as Banner then calmed down and went to check the result.

Attack on the Helicarrier
Fury being attacked by Hawkeye's soldiers
However, just before Bruce Banner could inform Fury and the others of the Tesseract's location, Loki played his hand, as Fury was caught off guard when the Helicarrier came under attack and their engine was destroyed in a daring commando raid by Loki's mind-controlled soldiers led by Hawkeye. With one of their propellers completely destroyed, Fury ordered the Avengers to assemble as they all desperately attempted to regain control of the sudden deadly situation.

Fury taking over command of their situation
Once he returned to his post on the bridge to take command of the situation, Fury ordered that the Helicarrier be positioned over water to ensure that if they fell out of the sky, they would not kill thousands of innocent lives below them, becoming annoyed as he had to give directions to the navigator about how to figure out where to turn to get over water. Fury remained instrumental in controlling the current situation, ensuring that Captain America and Iron Man focused onto repairing the damaged propeller to ensure their safety while giving his orders to the other team members to finally regain control.

Fury defending the Helicarrier's control room
However, just as they were taking back control, Maria Hill noticed a grenade being thrown into the control room, causing an explosion which knocked Hill backwards. Reacting swiftly, Fury then hid and allowed Loki's soldiers to ensure the room before he ambushed them, as Fury grabbed one from behind and took a hold of his gun before he gunned him and two other soldiers down. When another soldier then almost took Fury unprepared, Hill managed to shoot him dead, before Fury and Hill joined forces and held Loki's forces at bay to keep them from managing to take over their control room.

Fury shooting at Hawkeye and all his soldiers
With the attack still continuing, Fury had then engaged in a fierce gunfight alongside Hill, keeping all Loki's soldiers at bay, until Hawkeye joined the fight and had fired several explosive arrows at Fury and Hill, causing explosions which killed multiple S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Just as Fury saw Hawkeye and shot at him to keep him back, Hawkeye managed to shoot his hacking arrow at the control box, causing the entire Helicarrier to lose control, as Fury and Jasper Sitwell looked on in horror as they began falling from the sky, until Iron Man eventually succeeded at restarting the engines with Captain America's help.

Fury finally regaining control of their situation
Knowing that Hawkeye was running the attack, Fury then sent Black Widow to go out and personally engage him while also ordering one of his fighter jets to fire at Hulk in order to force him to escape the Helicarrier before he could tear it all apart, which resulted in Hulk furiously destroying the jet before disappearing having been thrown overboard. During the aftermath of the battle, Thor and Hulk had been thrown off the Helicarrier, while Hawkeye had been captured in the aftermath of a fight with the Black Widow, during which Loki had also escaped onboard a Quinjet in all of the still ongoing chaos. 

Fury witnesses agent Phil Coulson's demise
Fury had eventually found Phil Coulson severely wounded by Loki's hands, having been stabbed through the chest while he was attempting to stop Loki from getting away using the Destroyer Armor Prototype Gun, while Coulson apologized for failing to stop Loki from getting away. Despite all Fury's efforts to keep him awake, Coulson's wounds were fatal, and Coulson died just as a medical team arrived, with his own final words telling Fury that the Avengers Initiative would never work unless they had someone to avenge. Fury informed all of the other agents and the Avengers of Coulson's sudden death.

Inspiring the Avengers
Fury informs the Avengers of Coulson's death
Fury called a meeting with the last of the Avengers left on board the Helicarrier, Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, and showed Rogers all of Phil Coulson's beloved collection of trading cards, which were now stained with Coulson's blood as Fury claimed that he had gotten them from Coulson's jacket when in reality he had taken them from Coulson's locker in the room that seeing them would inspire the team, reminding Rogers of how Coulson had never had a chance to get his hero to sign them as he had asked just before his death.

Fury discusses the Avengers Initiative
With great regret, Fury told Rogers and Stark their communications and idea of where the Tesseract currently was were all gone, along with both Thor and Bruce Banner who had also been recently thrown off their Helicarrier during all of the chaos, while noting that due to Coulson's death he had lost his one good eye, questioning if he had that coming to him. Fury confessed to the pair that S.H.I.E.L.D. was indeed planning on building up their arsenal of weapons with all the Tesseract's technology, similar to what HYDRA had previously done, but noted that he had another plan which was an even greater risk.

Fury attempts to inspire Tony Stark into action
Fury then explained to Rogers and Stark that Coulson had wanted to believe in heroes as he had designed the Avengers Initiative to bring together remarkable people to see if they could become something more, and become the team which could fight all of the battles that S.H.I.E.L.D. never could, such as the threats that Loki was currently posing to the Earth. As Fury had noted how Coulson had died while still believing in this Initiative and the concept of heroes, Stark got up and left the room out of grief and frustration over Coulson's death, as Fury regretfully confessed that it was an old fashioned notion.

Fury looks at Coulson's trading cards
As he overlooked the skyline while looking at Coulson's trading cards himself, Maria Hill questioned Fury as Coulson kept his trading cards in his locker, not his jacket as Fury had claimed; Fury explained that he had used the cards to give the team the push they needed. Fury had used Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers, hoping that Coulson's death would be a trigger that would finally unite the team. Despite the ethically questionable nature of the plan, it proved to be effective, as the Avengers were inspired to stop Loki and had set off onboard a Quinjet in pursuit of Loki shortly thereafter.

Battle of New York
Fury watches the Avengers battle Loki's army
With the team inspired by agent Phil Coulson's death and wanting to avenge him, the Avengers Initiative had finally come to fruition, as the team traveled to New York City where they found Loki had activated the Tesseract, opening a portal above Stark Tower which had allowed his army of Chitauri to pour into New York, causing mass destruction and claiming hundreds of lives. As the Avengers battled Loki's army, Fury watched the action from the Helicarrier, however, he soon discovered that his role in the Avengers' battle was not yet done.

Fury argues with the World Security Council
With their battle still raging, Maria Hill had approached Fury and then informed him that the World Security Council were demanding to speak with him. To his horror, Fury spoke to the Council who issued orders for Fury to send his nuclear missile directly into the vicinity of Manhattan in order to destroy Loki and his army, which Fury furiously refused to do, still stating that he would not just order the deaths of millions of innocent lives despite Gideon Malick's insistence that they would lose everything in this war if they did not fire upon the invading force, before Fury had simply hung up his call with the Council.

Fury shoots down one of his own planes.
Furious that Fury was disobeying a direct order from them to fire the nuclear missile, the Council had instead chosen to take away Fury's command of S.H.I.E.L.D., overriding the order and sending an F-35 Lightning II to fire upon the city and kill millions of people. Hill was able to warn Fury of the launch and he ran onto the launchpad in his desperate attempt to stop the jet. Fury was able to shoot the jet with a rocket launcher causing it to crash but not kill the pilot, however, a second jet had been sent as well which Fury was unable to stop as it flew towards New York City while Fury looked on helplessly.

Fury watching Iron Man's ultimate sacrifice
Fury called Tony Stark to warn him of the impending nuke, Stark was able to intercept the missile and fly it towards the Wormhole. At the same time, Romanoff and Erik Selvig has figured out a way to close the Wormhole using the Scepter, giving Stark only seconds to lose the missile and escape. Stark then flew through the Wormhole and destroyed the Chitauri Command Center, killing all of the invading aliens of the mothership. Stark barely survived the fall back onto Earth but was caught and saved by Hulk. They looked across the city and determined they had won the war as they captured a bruised and beaten Loki yet again.

Disbanding the Avengers
Fury debriefs with the World Security Council
Now that the Avengers Initiative had ultimately succeeded, Fury's defiance of the World Security Council may not have been forgotten, but his methods and actions had saved the world. Fury then updated the Council members on the whereabouts of the Tesseract, which had been taken back to Asgard by Thor, despite Gideon Malick insisting that this was not Fury's decision to make, to which Fury simply claimed that he just had not argued with Thor.

Fury and Maria Hill discussing the Avengers
When the council asked the whereabouts of the Avengers, he told them that they were no longer being tracked as he believed that they had deserved the chance to go off the grid following their victory. When Hawley noted that Fury was putting them at risk by bringing the Avengers together, Fury informed her that they had successfully made it clear to every world that they were dangerous and there to protect Earth. When Malick asked if making a statement of strength had been the point of this entire endeavor, Fury instead claimed that he had made a promise (indirectly mentioning Carol Danvers), before he hung up the call to the Council.

Fury reassures Maria Hill about the Avengers
As Fury walked across the Helicarrier's control room and overlooking the skyline, he was questioned by Maria Hill about what they would do if the world came under threat again, as now the team had gone their separate ways, with some now traveling to the other end of the universe. Fury, however, resolved to call upon the Avengers should they be needed again, and made further assurances that they would come, why Hill asked him why he was so sure of this, he told her this would be that they would need them. With Hill now satisfied with the answer she walked away, leaving Fury overlooking the skyline.

Aftermath of the Invasion
Fury watches Phil Coulson's slow recovery
Unknown to the Avengers, Phil Coulson was brought back to life with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s advanced technology and experimental drugs. Fury chose to hide the truth about Coulson's survival from the Avengers, classifying the information to those with Level 7 clearance or above.  He then buried information about Coulson's involvement in Project T.A.H.I.T.I. in Coulson's fake grave, cryptically telling Maria Hill that he buried the information about who led Project T.A.H.I.T.I. when he decided not to bury Coulson.

Fury and Phil Coulson discussing the Bus
Following the Battle of New York, with the planet now learning of the existence of extraterrestrials and demigods, criminals and terrorist organizations wanted to obtain new technologies and weapons left by the Chitauri. Fury knew that he has to do something about that, instructing Coulson to build an operative team to prevent this. However, the true builder of Coulson's Team was Melinda May; upon orders from Fury, she covertly chose the members for very specific reasons pertaining to Coulson's resurrection. Fury also had May keep him updated on Coulson for signs of mental deterioration.

Fury overlooks the damage done to the Bus
Following Coulson's mission in Peru, Fury was furious at Coulson as the Bus was heavily damaged. He also warned him that Skye was a risk as she had previously been a member of the Rising Tide. As Fury left he told Coulson not to allow Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz to install their fish tank onto the plane. Shortly after the Battle of Greenwich, Coulson and his team were investigating the discovery of a lost Asgardian artifact known as the Berserker Staff. Coulson wanted to consult with Thor, but Fury informed him that Thor had taken himself "off the grid".

Fury warning Coulson of the risk Skye poses
According to Victoria Hand, when Coulson got abducted by the Centipede Project and tortured for several days by Edison Po, both Fury and Maria Hill wanted constant updates on the situation of the rescue mission coordinated by Hand and the other agents. Hand later informed Coulson that Fury was very relieved after hearing of Coulson's successful rescue mission. A few weeks later, May used a secure phone line on the Bus to call Fury and tell him that Coulson knew the truth about his resurrection.

HYDRA Uprising
Project Insight
Fury being confronted by Captain America
Shortly after the Battle of New York, Captain America remained with S.H.I.E.L.D. and worked with the STRIKE team at Fury's behest, often partnered with Black Widow. In 2014, Fury then covertly hired Georges Batroc and his team of mercenaries to take over the Lemurian Star in order to provide cover for Romanoff's mission to get information on Project Insight. After the successful mission, Rogers and Fury clashed over the director's secrecy concerning mission details.

Fury tells Steve Rogers about his grandfather
Wishing to prove to Rogers that he was willing to share secrets, Fury decided to take him to see Project Insight, overriding protocol to give Rogers security clearance. As they were going down in the elevator, Fury told Rogers the story of how his grandfather was often threatened and carried a gun at work to protect himself; Fury explained that while his grandfather liked people, he did not trust them and they now had guns somewhat bigger than what his grandfather had.

Fury discusses Project Insight with Rogers
Fury revealed to Rogers that S.H.I.E.L.D. intended to preemptively eliminate their enemies through the new Project Insight Helicarriers. Rogers, however, who mortified with the concept, pointed out how this meant that people were being killed before they had a chance to commit a crime, something that could be highly dangerous. Fury responded that soldiers like Rogers in World War II were involved in various war crimes, too, but Rogers refused to budge on his stance.

Fury slowly beginning to doubt Project Insight
As Fury returned to his office and prepared to look into the files that Romanoff had gathered from the Lemurian Star, he found that he did not have clearance for the files. This confused Fury, as there were very few to no documents which he was not cleared to access, raising his suspicions that Project Insight could be a risk. Fury went into the elevator and prepared to speak to the only other man who could have access to the blocked file.

Fury having a meeting with Alexander Pierce
Fury found Secretary Alexander Pierce speaking to the World Security Council about the Hijacking and Retaking of the Lemurian Star, defending Fury's actions involving the mission and discussing Batroc. Fury briefly pulled Pierce out of the meeting and asked him to delay Project Insight's launch, hesitant of the possible dangers of the project to the world. Pierce was incredibly reluctant as he knew the amount of work which would go into such an action, but Fury insisted that it would be worthwhile. Pierce agreed with one condition, that Fury had Iron Man visit his niece's birthday party. Fury agreed and the pair shook hands and departed.

Attack on Nick Fury
Fury giving his latest orders to Maria Hill
Afterward, Fury drove across Washington, D.C. and called Maria Hill, telling her to come to Washington to discuss his theories about Project Insight and gave her three hours to arrive, which she did not question. As Fury continued driving, he encountered two police officers who appeared to be watching him, so Fury insulted the pair, assuming that they were simply being racist and profiling him.

Fury defends himself against HYDRA soldiers
Before he could react, a group of HYDRA agents disguised as cops then attacked Fury while he was driving, slamming into his car and using an Electronic Battering Ram to try and penetrate the vehicle's armor. Despite suffering a fractured arm, Fury was able to utilize his SUV's defense mechanisms to fight back against the assassins, firing a machine gun at them before driving away. During a prolonged car chase, Fury continued to fight and outwit his attackers while driving.

Fury is almost murdered by the Winter Soldier
Just as Fury got to safety after causing two of his assassins' car to be hit by a passing lorry, he encountered an assassin known as the Winter Soldier, who used a Disc Grenade to disable Fury's SUV, causing it to violently crash and greatly injure him. As the Winter Soldier walked to the car to execute him, Fury used a Mouse Hole to cut through the car and escape into the sewers, seeking assistance from the only person he felt he could trust.

Fury hiding out in Steve Rogers' apartment
Fury retreated to Steve Rogers's apartment and sat waiting in the darkness while listening to music. When Rogers arrived after speaking to his neighbor, Fury greeted him and showed Rogers his injuries to express the seriousness of the situation. He spoke in coded language, claiming to have been thrown out of his house by his wife, who very few people knew about. Meanwhile, Fury texted on his phone to communicate to Rogers his real message that S.H.I.E.L.D. was compromised, as he knew the apartment was bugged.

Fury is seemingly killed by the Winter Soldier
However, the Winter Soldier had followed Fury there and fired two sniper rounds through the wall and into his chest, mortally wounding him. As Fury struggled for breath, he gave Rogers the hard drive of Project Insight and urged him not to trust anyone. Sharon Carter arrived and treated Fury's wounds while Rogers chased the Winter Soldier, but was unable to capture the assassin. Fury was taken to the hospital and ultimately pronounced dead during surgery, after which his body was taken by Hill.

Fighting Back
S.H.I.E.L.D. declares Fury as deceased
Despite Alexander Pierce and the entirety of S.H.I.E.L.D. believing him to have been killed, Fury had in fact successfully faked his death by using Tetrodotoxin B, a drug developed as a heart-rate suppressant by Bruce Banner to relieve stress. Fury retreated with Maria Hill and Doctor Fine to a hidden facility until Hill was able to bring Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff and Sam Wilson, who had almost been captured by HYDRA, to the base and reveal the truth.

Fury greets his team during his recovery
Fury told the group that they needed to expose Project Insight and save S.H.I.E.L.D., but Rogers insisted that he intended to destroy S.H.I.E.L.D. entirely, pointing out that Fury's compartmentalization and secrecy were what allowed HYDRA to infiltrate the organization in the first place, as well as create the Winter Soldier. Although Fury told Rogers that he had not known about the Winter Soldier, Rogers pointed out that Fury probably would not have told him even if he did. Realizing that Romanoff, Wilson, and Hill agreed with Rogers, Fury then consented to destroy S.H.I.E.L.D.

Fury makes a plan to destroy S.H.I.E.L.D.
The team then worked out a plan to infiltrate the Triskelion and destroy Project Insight, which had been revealed to be a HYDRA plot orchestrated by Arnim Zola and Pierce. Before returning to the Triskelion, Fury ordered Agents Bobbi Morse and Isabelle Hartley to rescue Robert Gonzales in the Iliad. He also ordered Morse to destroy the ship in order to prevent HYDRA from obtaining a Monolith of extraterrestrial origin.

Battle at the Triskelion
Fury finally returning back into the Triskelion
The plan went underway as Captain America rallied the remaining loyal S.H.I.E.L.D. agents together to fight HYDRA while Black Widow used a Photostatic Veil to disguise herself as Hawley to infiltrate the World Security Council and get to Project Insight's leader. Once Romanoff was able to capture Alexander Pierce, Fury arrived and confronted his former friend. 

Fury personally confronting Alexander Pierce
While Pierce joked about having sent flowers to Fury's funeral, he attempted to justify his actions of nearly assassinating Fury and causeing mass-genocide by comparing Project Insight to what Fury did in Bogotá, not waiting for orders but doing what needed to be done. Fury asked why Pierce made him Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., and Pierce explained that it was because he felt Fury was the best at what he did, as well as being the most ruthless person he'd ever met.

Fury uploading all of HYDRA's secrets online
Fury and Romanoff revealed that they intended to release all of S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA's files onto the internet, exposing Pierce as a traitor, but Pierce remained confident as he had ensured that Fury's clearance had already been wiped from the system. However, Fury replied that to stay ahead of him, Pierce needed to keep both eyes open, thus revealing he had a security contingency in place should S.H.I.E.L.D.'s arsenal fall into the wrong hands. Fury then used his blind eye, which Pierce had forgotten to delete from the retinal scan, to unlock the system.

Fury shoots and kills Alexander Pierce
When Pierce attempted to turn the tables on his situation, killing all the members of the Council and trying to take Romanoff hostage, Fury was left with no choice but to surrender to save his friend's life. However, when Romanoff used a Taser Disk to disable the miniature bomb attached to her, Fury took the opportunity to shoot Pierce twice in the chest, killing the secretary and leaving his body behind as he helped Romanoff get back to her feet.

Fury pilots a helicopter away from the battle
Fury and Romanoff escaped in a helicopter and witnessed Rogers successfully complete their mission, destroying all of the Helicarriers while battling the Winter Soldier. As Fury flew the Helicopter, one of the Insight Helicarriers crashed into the side of the Triskelion, causing Sam Wilson to run for his life until he leaped from the window and barely managed to land inside the helicopter thanks to Fury's exceptional piloting skills.

Fury destroying the things of his former life.
Rogers managed to survive his battle with the Winter Soldier and their mission was complete, resulting in the world learning of HYDRA's attempt to take over the world. Following the subsequent fall of S.H.I.E.L.D., Fury went into hiding, burning his possessions and replacing his eyepatch with a pair of sunglasses, along with a wardrobe change, to blend into a crowd. Only a select few others were given knowledge of his survival, including Eric Koenig and Phil Coulson.

Departing
Fury visiting his grave with Rogers and Wilson
Fury went to his fake graveside to talk with Steve Rogers, Sam Wilson, and Natasha Romanoff before he went into hiding. He prepared to depart for Europe, intending to seek out and take down all of the remaining HYDRA cells. Fury asked if Falcon would like to join him there, but Wilson refused, stating that he was a soldier, not a spy. As they shook hands, Fury reminded them not to tell anyone of his survival.

Fury talking with Steve Rogers before leaving
Fury later guided Phil Coulson to a secure S.H.I.E.L.D. base in the Canadian wilderness, using Coulson's S.H.I.E.L.D. badge to send the base's coordinates. Coulson took a leap of faith in assuming that Fury and not HYDRA had sent the coordinates. Once at Providence, Eric Koenig assured Coulson that Fury was alive, but that only they, Hill, and a few Avengers were aware of this. Koenig instructed Coulson to keep it secret from his team for the time being.

Fury continues his own undercover missions
While Fury remained under the radar, Melinda May confronted Maria Hill to find out who led Project T.A.H.I.T.I., so Hill simply told her the cryptic answer that Fury had given her. May then suggested that Hill ask Fury herself, but Hill quickly said that Fury was still dead. May, doubting this, replied that she would believe that when she saw it herself. Later, May realized what Fury meant by his riddle and went out to recover the video hidden inside of Coulson's grave.

Battle at Cybertek
Fury rescues Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz
On his way to Europe, Fury received a weak distress call which led him to Agents Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz, who were stranded in the ocean. He managed to rescue both of them, although Fitz suffered brain damage from the ordeal. When Simmons awoke while being treated, however, she was able to provide him with the information he needed to find Phil Coulson. Fury headed to the Cybertek Manufacturing Facility where Coulson was involved with a fight against HYDRA.

Fury handing Phil Coulson the Destroyer Gun
Fury managed to locate Coulson in a fierce battle against the rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. agent John Garrett, who had gained super strength, as Coulson crawled for cover he found Fury waiting for him, joking about his current appearance since going underground. Although Coulson was furious about being kept in the dark about Project T.A.H.I.T.I., they agreed it was best to focus on defeating Garrett, so Fury supplied Coulson with the Destroyer Armor Prototype Gun. Together they fought Garrett, who had become extremely powerful due to being injected with the GH.325 serum.

Fury and Phil Coulson fighting John Garrett
While Coulson blasted away his bodyguards, Garrett was able to survive when Fury shot him multiple times in the chest due to his new enhanced healing and began mocking Fury and Coulson. As Garrett continued to monologue about his plans, Fury was able to correct him when he misquoted one of Fury's speeches, making it clear that his mindset was all wrong. However, Skye managed to communicate with Deathlok who betrayed Garrett and killed him by crushing his head while Fury and Coulson looked on without sympathy.

A New Foundation
Fury makes Coulson Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
On the Bus, Phil Coulson, accompanied by Melinda May, infuriated, yelled at Fury because he proceeded to use the Project T.A.H.I.T.I. on him even after Coulson told him that the procedure was dangerous, especially since it was meant to resurrect a fallen Avenger. Fury told Coulson that he brought Coulson back because, in his eyes, Coulson was an Avenger, one of the few people that he trusted and told Coulson that S.H.I.E.L.D.'s goal was founded on the purest of ideas: protection. He then gave Coulson the Toolbox, a device that contained everything Coulson would need to rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D. and appointed him as the new Director.

Fury leaves to go underground for a time
Once he had told him that how S.H.I.E.L.D. proceeded from here was up to Coulson, Fury then got up and prepared to leave the Bus, telling Coulson that he intended to put his focus on having his feet on the ground rather than having a view of everything like he had as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. When Coulson suggested that he meant he would disappear, Fury laughed and lifted up his sunglasses to reveal his scarred eye, telling Coulson with a smile that he should know him better than that as he would be everywhere, he then turned around he walked away, leaving S.H.I.E.L.D. in the best hands.

Ultron Offensive
Advising the Avengers
Fury learns of Ultron's plans for genocide
When Tony Stark inadvertently created an artificial intelligence robot known as Ultron, his creation immediately turned against humanity and declared war with mankind. The Avengers battled Ultron and the Maximoff twins whom Ultron had recruited; however, the battle left almost all the Earth's Mightiest Heroes wounded both physically and mentally.

Fury offers some more advice to Tony Stark
The team traveled to Clint Barton's Homestead where Fury was waiting. Fury spoke to Stark in private and tried to get his mind back on track after Wanda Maximoff had used her powers to make Stark see visions of a terrible future in which the Avengers had been killed. When Stark claimed that he would be responsible for the deaths of his friends, Fury reminded him that he did not invent the concept of hate and war, but he could fight against them.

Fury gives another speech to the Avengers
Having revealed his survival to the rest of the Avengers, Fury and the team discussed their next move. Natasha Romanoff mocked Stark for his failure to save the world and Fury tried to offer them all the confidence to go into battle again to save the world. Romanoff also commented that she had hoped Fury would have more to offer but he insisted that this team was enough and together they could stand and outwit and defeat Ultron and his army.

Fury leaves the Avengers to fight Ultron
Eventually, Bruce Banner worked out that Ultron's next move would be to force Helen Cho to build him a new body out of Vibranium and the Scepter, one that if he was able to use, he would be too powerful to stop, so they got ready to investigate in Seoul. As the team prepared for their next battle with Ultron, Fury spoke to Stark and requested Maria Hill's assistance with the next stage in his plan to help the Avengers, which he accepted without any hesitation.

Battle of Sokovia
Fury leading their attack against Ultron's army
Fury had secretly been working with Phil Coulson on a project known as the Theta Protocol, a hidden Helicarrier kept completely off records for emergency use only.  With Coulson's and Maria Hill's help, Fury gathered together a team of former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and took possession of the Helicarrier. While the Avengers continued their battle with Ultron's army, Fury arrived in the Helicarrier and used the Lifeboats to take the civilians to safety; he sent War Machine into the battle to fight the army of Ultron robots.

Fury destroys another of the Ultron Sentries
Midway through the battle, one of the Ultron Sentries crashed onto the bridge of the Helicarrier and attempted to kill the crew inside, going straight for Cameron Klein. Although Maria Hill shot at the robot multiple times, this did not seem to slow the machine down. Fury finally managed to destroy it by stabbing it through the head with a piece of debris. With Fury's help, the Avengers were able to destroy Ultron and save thousands of lives.

New Avengers
Fury arriving inside the New Avengers Facility
Fury received information from S.H.I.E.L.D. about where Hulk and the Quinjet may have crashed. Fury later arrived at the New Avengers Facility in upstate New York and told Natasha Romanoff the last known location of the Avengers Quinjet, which Hulk had taken at the end of the battle. He suggested that Banner had likely escaped and gone to live in peace. Romanoff asked Fury if he had known she and Banner would get feelings for each other; Fury answered that he had simply hoped for the best and had gotten a great team for them to use.

Fury having his talk with Natasha Romanoff
In the wake of dissolution of the Avengers which had been due to the actions of Helmut Zemo, Fury began operating under a private crew of his own, with hand-selected operatives. He was met by Maria Hill at his safehouse to discuss recent events of that conflict, which included the falling out between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers and the imprisonment of Rogers's entire team at the Raft. Sometime later, Fury met with Rogers, who was now a fugitive, to convince him to contact Stark and work things out in the wake of their disagreeement, although this seemed like an impossible task.

Fury and Maria Hill talking about Wakanda
One day in 2018, Fury was driving through Atlanta with Maria Hill and with no clear idea of what was happening, asked for updates on Tony Stark's location after he had disappeared into a spaceship. Hill replied they had found nothing despite an extensive search around the world. She then informed Fury of unidentified objects detected over in Wakanda, indicating that something serious was happening there.

Fury realizes something terrible has happened
Before Fury could then order Hill to notify Cameron Klein where they would meet, a car spiraled out of control right in front of them and crashed, blocking their route. When Hill stepped out of Fury's car to check whether the occupants were injured, she simply noted nobody was in it, unaware that it was due to the Snap. The duo began to notice civilians disappearing and a helicopter colliding into a nearby building.

As Fury instructed Hill to call control for a code red, she alerted him that she was disappearing herself, and he watched in horror with nothing he could do to save her. Fury raced back to his car and grabbed his pager, sending out an emergency alert to Captain Marvel. Mere seconds later, his hand vanished, and Fury cursed as he disappeared.

Blip Aftermath
Fury attends Tony Stark's funeral
Five years later, as a result of the Blip, Fury was restored to life. As per Stark's wishes, Fury was given a pair of glasses that housed the E.D.I.T.H. artificial tactical intelligence system, and was instructed to bequeath the glasses to Peter Parker, having been made aware that Parker was Spider-Man. Fury attended Tony Stark's funeral at Stark's house, where he stood silently on the porch and briefly reunited with Carol Danvers for the first time since 1995. While at the funeral, Fury noticed Parker in attendance, and was going to introduce himself and deliver the glasses but changed his mind, feeling that the time was not right nor appropriate. 

Fury is contacted by Talos
After spending some time re-establishing contact with the Skrulls, Fury asked Talos and Soren to impersonate him and Maria Hill on Earth for a while as he took a vacation on the Skrull flagship in space. Fury also gave Talos the E.D.I.T.H. glasses that Stark wanted him to deliver to Parker, and informed Talos of Parker's identity as Spider-Man.

Fury ends his vacation
After the resolution of the Westview Anomaly, Fury sent a Skrull to arrange a meeting with Monica Rambeau. In mid 2024, Fury was contacted by Talos and was informed of Mysterio and how they had been tricked. Realizing that the situation had gotten worse, Fury decided to end his vacation. Turning off his simulation of the beach, Fury told the other Skrulls to get back to work, asking them where his shoes were.

Personality
Nick Fury is somewhat of an enigma, but his actions prove him to be bold and pragmatic. It's nearly impossible to read his emotions. He is known to manipulate people and is the bearer of many, classified, global security secrets. Nor does he tell whatever happened to his damaged eye. However, while showing Project Insight to Steve Rogers he gives a backstory saying, he lost an eye the last time he trusted someone, insinuating he doesn't trust easily and he is known to compartmentalize. Ironically, Fury lost sight in his left eye over trusting Goose, and not an enemy. 

Fury and his organization, S.H.I.E.L.D., share a cynical outlook. Sometimes, Fury finds that cutthroat actions and clandestine, illegal operations are necessary to protect the world. Fury stated that "the world is filling up with people that can't be matched" and advocates methods for S.H.I.E.L.D. to arm themselves against potential threats, even if it involves creating weapons of mass destruction. Fury himself quotes "that S.H.I.E.L.D. sees the world as it is, not how it likes to be seen"; though Captain America believed that Project Insight was controlling people using fear. Fury's main goal was world safety against alien and human threats, going so far as to create a team of people with extraordinary abilities called the Avengers and secretly planned to use the Tesseract for weapons as a secondary security option. The latter was kept a secret, even from the Avengers. 

While his decisions make him appear ruthless and the nature of his profession occasionally requires a moral grey, Fury genuinely cares about human life and didn't see his agents or Avengers as pawns. Phil Coulson was his closest friend and he seems to trust people like Maria Hill and Steve Rogers. However, he did use Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers and used alien biology to bring him back to life, no matter how much Coulson begged to die. In fact, he would often help the Avengers, whether by providing resources or motivating them during turbulent times. When New York was under attack by the Chitauri, the World Security Council insisted on a nuclear strike on New York, but Fury refused to destroy a populated city. He was also seen rescuing people from Sokovia when Ultron uplifted it in the air and intended to use it as a weapon against Earth. In spite of the seriousness of his job, Fury has displayed a knack for dry humor and use of visual puns whilst regarding his eye and his constant global surveillance, often using irony and metaphors due to the combination, i.e. referring to Tony Stark "I've got my eye on you".

Fury is a man of great and indomitable will, but he can feel too, as he was shaken with the death of Coulson and was deeply disturbed at seeing Hill fade away due to the Snap. While visiting Tony Stark at Clint Barton's home, Fury told Stark that he cared very much about him. It is also shown that Fury has a soft spot for cats, as shown by his interactions with Goose. Fury was saddened by Stark's death and paid his respects to a fallen friend by attending his funeral.

One thing about Fury for certain is that he prefers everyone that knows him to only call him by his last name, even his family. This allows him to know instantly if there's a spy or imposter around if they call him Nick or Nicholas. Though if its someone who likes to annoy him, it also allows Fury to confirm their identity.

He has used these talents to great effect in his leadership of S.H.I.E.L.D. for years until he resigned. Phil Coulson has even stated that Nick was always five steps ahead of anyone else.

When he needed intelligence on Bruce Banner, he sat practically unnoticed among restaurant patrons to observe him. Fury also managed to make the majority of those who knew him to think he was dead, including HYDRA and the rest of the world. During his first meeting with Tony Stark, Fury was able to sneak into his mansion without being detected and managed to shut down J.A.R.V.I.S.'s systems.

Equipment
Weapons
Fury has access to an array of S.H.I.E.L.D. weapons, conventional and otherwise. In addition, due to him being the leader of a secret but a covert/military organization, he has access to the most cutting-edge technology S.H.I.E.L.D. has to offer.

SIG Sauer P226: The SIG Sauer P226 was the standard pistol issued to S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel in the 1990s. Fury carried this handgun during his mission to interrogate Carol Danvers. While it was taken from him as he arrived to the Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. Facility, he managed to take it again, and he used it to hold Talos at gunpoint when he entered into the Rambeau Residence. He also tried to use it when Starforce arrived at Mar-Vell's Laboratory, but Minn-Erva pointed her weapon at him to make him drop it.
Glock 17: The Glock 17 was the standard sidearm used by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, before being replaced by the Smith & Wesson M&P. Fury carried one while he accompanied Tony Stark to his mansion in order to help him overcome his Palladium poisoning finishing Howard Stark's work.

Smith & Wesson M&P: The Smith & Wesson M&P pistol is the standard sidearm carried by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, and Fury also carried one as his sidearm, using it to fire at Loki while he escaped after having obtained the Tesseract for the first time, when the Helicarrier is attacked, during the Battle at the Triskelion, and to try to kill John Garrett during the Battle at Cybertek. He also carried it while commanding the bridge of the Helicarrier during the Battle of Sokovia, but he did not use it against any of the Ultron Sentries that attacked it.
