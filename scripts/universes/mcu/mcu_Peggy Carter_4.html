<html><p>According to S.H.I.E.L.D. Files, Peggy joined the Special Air Service (SAS) in 1936. In reality, SAS wasn't formed until July 1941. The file also says prior to this, she served as a British Air Force Nurse from 1934-1936. None of this history has been referenced on-screen, only that Carter was a code-breaker, and so should be taken as non-canon along with some other inaccurate information presented at the time due to her history not being as fleshed out when that Deleted Scene was written.
Carter’s S.H.I.E.L.D. file also lists her time with the Strategic Science Reserve as being from 1950-1985. Presumably, this was actually her time with S.H.I.E.L.D. since her time with the SSR was listed above this line. Whether or not it was Carter’s time with S.H.I.E.L.D., it was regardless proven to be false as she was still shown to be with S.H.I.E.L.D. by 1989.
The file also lists Carter’s date of birth as April 9th, 1919. This was later proven to be slightly off to when she actually was born in 1921.

Behind the Scenes
There was a planned scene for The Avengers where Steve Rogers reunites with an elderly Carter, but said scene was never filmed. The idea was eventually recycled and integrated into Captain America: The Winter Soldier. However, there is a deleted scene in The Avengers where Rogers finds files about the deceased Howling Commandos and Carter. Her address and telephone number are on the file, but Rogers decides to not make a call.
Peggy Carter is the most frequently recurring secondary character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, having been featured in six movies (Captain America: The First Avenger, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man, Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Endgame), a one-shot and two TV series (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Agent Carter).
Emily Blunt was offered the role, but she turned it down.
Peggy Carter almost didn't appear in Avengers: Endgame with her presence during the Theft of the Space Stone sequence not included in the first draft: "Our first draft did not have this, and it would have been a shame," confirmed Stephen McFeely "It's really lovely. Just the structure of the scene. The production design, setting up this office in such a way that he can be in shadow and she can be in light."
Kelly J. Dent, Shauna Duggins, Kimberly Shannon Murphy were stunt doubles for Hayley Atwell in the role of Peggy Carter.
Caridad Angus and Monique Davis were stand-ins for Hayley Atwell in the role of Peggy Carter.
Emma Lillie Lees was a photo double for Hayley Atwell in the role of Peggy Carter.
