<html><p>Stark eventually found a large bedroom filled with movie props, along with the Mandarin's wardrobe; there were also signs that someone was living inside and Stark came upon two half-naked women in the bed. Hearing someone enter from the bathroom, Stark then hid; the Mandarin entered, speaking in a British accent. Stark ambushed him, holding the Mandarin at gunpoint, and was surprised by the sudden cowardly reaction from the terrorist, demanding answers.

Stark is found and ambushed by Eric Savin
To his horror, Stark soon learned that "the Mandarin" was nothing more than a character the actor, Trevor Slattery, had been hired to play; Slattery was given endless amounts of drugs and anything else he desired in return for taking the blame for the explosions. The person who had employed him was Aldrich Killian, who needed to cover up the failures of his Extremis program. Just then, Stark was knocked unconscious by Eric Savin, who took him hostage.

Aldrich Killian's Hostage
Stark is questioned by Maya Hansen in captivity
Upon awakening in captivity at Aldrich Killian's mansion, Stark was shocked and angered to learn that Maya Hansen was working for A.I.M.; she had used the formula he wrote down in a drunken daze after their night together to better stabilize Extremis but needed money so she joined Killian. Although having forgotten all about the equation he gave her, Stark refused to help Hansen better understand it and expressed his disgust over her losing her soul, since he remembered her as a woman who used to have a moral psychology and a sense of right and wrong. Stark tried to appeal to what remained of Hansen's humanity to make her help him escape.

Stark's life is threatened by Aldrich Killian
Their conversation was interrupted when Killian arrived and revealed the reasons behind A.I.M.’s actions, and how he was grateful to Stark for teaching him that he needed to control the chaos from behind the scenes. Killian expressed that since Stark left him behind on the roof in Switzerland, it gave him a sense of desperation, which changed his life. Killian went on to discuss Trevor Slattery's role as the Mandarin, acknowledging his over-the-top personality.

Stark learns Pepper Potts is being tortured
Killian compared Slattery's Mandarin performance to him creating a terrorist like Osama Bin Laden or Muammar Gaddafi to blame his failures on. Expressing his desire for Stark to suffer desperation, Killian revealed he had captured Pepper Potts and was infecting her with Extremis, leaving her in danger of exploding; Stark would be now forced to help improve Extremis in order to save Potts' life, with Killian cruelly noting how much pain she was currently in.

Stark witnesses Hansen betraying Killian
While Stark struggled to look at the video feed of the woman he loved suffering, Killian offered to pay him for helping them and began to strangle Stark. Hansen, realizing he had gone too far, demanded Stark's release by threatening to kill herself with an overdose of Extremis and wound Killian in the blast, whilst depriving him of his chief researcher. Stark watched in horror and sadness as Killian murdered her without any remorse. As Killian left Stark to think about his next move, Stark angrily called him a maniac for killing Hansen while Killian claimed to be a "visionary".

Break Out
Stark attempts to intimidate both his guards
Stark was left guarded by two of Aldrich Killian's henchmen, one of whom broke Harley Keener's sister's watch. Once he learned the correct time, Stark worked out that his suit would be charged by now and offered the henchmen, one of whom he nicknamed “Ponytail Express”, a chance to escape, believing that it would arrive in seconds; however, this led to an awkward period of Stark awaiting his suit which took considerably longer than he expected to arrive.

Stark collects parts of his Mark XVII armor
The reason being that the doors to Keener's barn the pieces were being kept in were chained shut, and therefore the rest of the armor was trapped. Summoning his Mark XLII all the way from Keener's home, Stark was given one of his gauntlets, which he used to shoot Ponytail Express and free himself. A boot then attached itself onto Stark’s leg to give him the advantage in the fight against his captors, although Stark still questioned where the rest of the armor was.

Stark fights all Aldrich Killian's henchmen
Having escaped captivity, Stark was forced to battle several guards from A.I.M., despite only getting a hand and leg part of his suit for the duration of the fight. Stark found that this greatly affected how he could fight, as he struggled to maintain control of flying while wearing only the pieces of armor he had. When one guard grabbed Stark from behind, Stark used the boot’s repulsor to launch himself backwards and knock out the guard, stealing his gun in the process.

Stark allows the final A.I.M. guard to leave
Keener soon freed the rest of the parts of the Mark XLII, knowing that Stark was in need of his armor. Once the guards were all knocked out, Stark prepared to shoot the last one, only to be amused when the man quickly surrendered to him as he claimed to hate working for Killian and A.I.M.. The rest of the suit arrived and Stark made his way through the facility. He greeted J.A.R.V.I.S. while seeing the Iron Patriot Armor fly off, with his own suit failing to fly.

Stark and Rhodes question Trevor Slattery
To Stark's surprise, he ran into James Rhodes, who he thought was in the armor; it turned out that the Iron Patriot suit was stolen by Eric Savin in order to kidnap President Matthew Ellis. Needing a way to go after Killian, Stark and Rhodes interrogated Trevor Slattery, waking him from another drunken stupor. Seeking to save the President, Stark remembered that Slattery had been given a speedboat from Killian and demanded it.

Stark and James Rhodes discuss the rescue
Onboard Slattery's boat, Stark called Vice President Rodriguez to warn him that President Ellis was about to be attacked by Savin posing as the Iron Patriot, with Rodriguez informing them that Ellis was about to board Air Force One. After Rodriguez promised to handle the situation, Stark and Rhodes next discussed who they had time to save, Pepper Potts or President Ellis. Stark decided to remote control his armor so they could save both of them.

Saving the Air Force One Crew
Iron Man and Eric Savin battle to the death
To protect President Matthew Ellis, Stark remote-controlled his armor to Air Force One, where Eric Savin had already forced President Ellis into the Iron Patriot armor and sent it away. Fighting Savin, Iron Man's armor was briefly disabled by the man’s Extremis powers, but he soon managed to shoot directly through Savin's chest and kill him, though at the cost of the plane falling apart around him.

Iron Man catches the falling passengers
To his horror, Iron Man witnessed all of the passengers onboard being sucked out of the plane through a hole caused by a bomb Savin had planted and now plummeting thousands of feet to the ocean below. With everyone else falling, Iron Man flew out of Air Force One just before it exploded, asking J.A.R.V.I.S. how he could save them all. J.A.R.V.I.S. informed him that the Mark XLII could not carry that many people at the same time.

Iron Man saves all of the other passengers
With no time to spare, Iron Man grabbed ahold of Heather and told her to in turn grab whoever she could reach, explaining that he would send a shockwave through her body so that Heather could not let go of them. Iron Man saved two other passengers while diving down to collect the others, quickly running out of time as they fell towards the ocean. Forming a human chain by the passengers grabbing each other, Iron Man dove for the final passenger once everyone was linked.

Iron Man successfully saves all the people
With everyone now connected, Iron Man used his thrusters to give them more height before he then safely deposited them in a river. As the people cheered in celebration, Iron Man ensured that they were all okay and complimented the group before turning around to return to the boat and save Pepper Potts. However, when Iron Man was not looking, the armor was knocked apart by an incoming truck, smashing into pieces across the road.

Stark breaks off his connection to the armor
Still back onboard the boat, Stark took off his Mark XLII Telepresence Headset and confirmed to James Rhodes that he had indeed saved the passengers. As they prepared to move on to find Potts and Aldrich Killian, Stark was then informed by J.A.R.V.I.S. that the rubble had been cleared out from his Malibu Mansion, finally allowing him to reactivate the Iron Legion. Stark ordered J.A.R.V.I.S. to send the suits to him ready for the next battle against Killian's soldiers.

Battle on the Norco
Stark and James Rhodes prepare for the fight
Stark and James Rhodes had eventually traced Aldrich Killian to an impounded oil tanker called the Norco where he now intended to kill President Matthew Ellis on live television. Sneaking in, they were attacked by several Extremis Soldiers. Stark fired his gun at the soldiers, but was unable to stop them due to poor aim, which Rhodes mocked him about. Taking out a light from a long distance, Rhodes quickly proved himself to be the superior marksman due to his training in the Armed Forces which greatly annoyed Stark.

Stark calls upon the entire Iron Legion
Outnumbered, Stark summoned the Iron Legion to their aid, all of which were currently being controlled by J.A.R.V.I.S., except the Mark XLII, which was running late after trying to save the president in Air Force One. Rhodes looked on in amazement as all the armors flew in together and lined up, awaiting the orders of Stark. Taking delight in his achievements, Stark then wished J.A.R.V.I.S. a Merry Christmas before sending all of the armors into battle, ordering them to target the Extremis Soldiers with extreme prejudice. Stark watched the battle unfolding, ordering Mark XXXVIII to hold up the platform under them and Mark XVII to assist Mark XXXV in the fight.

Stark dons his new Mark XXXIII armor
Stark donned the Mark XXXIII suit and prepared to fly into battle, as Rhodes requested his own armor to fight in. Stark, however, revealed that the armors were only coded to himself and therefore, he had to send the Mark XVII to carry Rhodes to find both President Ellis and the Iron Patriot Armor, much to Rhodes' annoyance. Stark then flew across the battlefield in search for Pepper Potts so that he could take her away from the battle towards safety.

Stark attempts to rescue Pepper Potts
While his suits continued to fight all of the enhanced soldiers, with several of the armors being torn apart by their Extremis powers, Iron Man eventually found Potts unharmed underneath wreckage from a recent explosion. He mocked her about all of this happening because she spent time with Maya Hansen, while trying to get her out without risking the structure falling and crushing her. Reaching out, Iron Man and Potts were able to grab each other's hands.

Iron Man is ambushed by Aldrich Killian
However, before Stark could free Potts, Aldrich Killian unexpectedly attacked him and damaged the armor's Arc Reactor. Pinning Iron Man down, Killian began slowly burning through his suit with his finger, taunting that Stark should close his eyes and die. Refusing to give in, however, Stark was forced to cut off Killian's arm with the armor's hidden blade and eject from the suit, only for Killian's still red-hot severed arm to burn through the floor underneath Potts.

Stark chases closely behind Pepper Potts
Seeing that Potts was trapped and being pulled towards a sheer edge, Stark charged through the battlefield as he demanded that J.A.R.V.I.S. provide him with a new suit. As he ran across the Norco, Stark failed to get a new armor and was informed that Rhodes had rescued President Ellis and was taking him to safety. With all of the Extremis Soldiers being kept at bay, Stark began catching up with Potts and leaped from one platform to the other to get to her.

Stark witnesses Pepper Potts' seeming death
Approaching as close as he could, Stark was still unable to quite reach Potts and begged her to reach out for him as he stretched as far as he could to try and save her life. However, Stark was then forced to watch in utter horror as a jolt from the platform Potts was on caused her to lose her grip and she fell into a pit of fire 200 feet below to a certain death. Stark looked on with complete heartbreak and devastation as he failed to protect the one person he could not live without.

Showdown with Aldrich Killian
Iron Man prepares to fight Aldrich Killian
While Stark continued to react in horror, Aldrich Killian then appeared and mocked him, claiming that if he was in Stark's position, he would have caught Pepper Potts. Infuriated, Stark then ran forward in order to engage in a final fight with Killian. When Killian leaped into the air to strike Stark, he then dived underneath him and donned the Mark XVI armor.

Iron Man fights against Aldrich Killian
Even with his armor on, Tony found Killian was the superior fighter and the situation was made even worse by his Extremis abilities, which could penetrate any armor with relative ease. Killian used his red-hot limbs to cut through the metal armor and attempt to kill Iron Man. As their duel continued, Iron Man did all he could to subdue Killian, but found that the man could withstand and heal from any strike and his strength also surpassed Stark's, even tearing off part of the Armor from Stark's left hand and healing from having his own left hand broken when they clashed their fists. When he was pinned down, Iron Man again exited his suit to avoid Killian's burning fist.

Iron Man dons yet another armor in the fight
Having launched himself off the edge of the platform, Iron Man then donned the Mark XL in midair and attacked Killian once again. Iron Man flew Killian across the battlefield but was still unable to tire him out, as all his attempts to stop Killian were met with superhuman combat attacks and his armor was once again cut to pieces by Killian's Extremis powers. Killian almost cut off Iron Man's leg before Stark was finally able to gain the upper hand.

Stark attempts to reclaim the Mark XLII armor
Iron Man was able to avoid death once again by ejecting out of his suit seconds before Killian ripped it apart with his bare hands, falling hard on his back onto the platform below. Standing alone on the platform, Stark, now armor-less due to the rest of the Iron Legion being preoccupied with his command to destroy all of Killian's Extremis Soldiers, awaited the arrival of the Mark XLII but was soon deflated when it crashed and disassembled once again.

Stark traps Aldrich Killian inside his armor
Amused at Stark's failed attempt to don another armor to continuing fighting against him, Killian mockingly spoke to Stark about him not deserving Potts and claiming that he was close to making her "perfect" in his eyes by experimenting on her with Extremis. Stark agreed that Killian was right and he did not deserve Potts, but retorted that she already was perfect before sending the Mark XLII onto Killian, trapping him with all the thrusters on full power, eventually pinning him against the wall.

Iron Man attempts to escape the explosions
As Killian yelled out in anger at seemingly being defeated, Stark then ordered J.A.R.V.I.S. to activate the armor's self-destruct protocol while he escaped. Diving off the platform, Stark avoided the massive explosion behind him, which seemingly destroyed Killian once and for all. As the fireball continued to grow and destroyed most of the Norco, Stark summoned the Mark XV to catch him as he jumped to safety, only for the armor to fail on the way down by crashing into the platform, causing Stark to crash-land, barely avoiding all of the flames and the debris that followed him down from the explosion.

Suit Destruction
Stark recovers from surviving the battle
Lying on the ground, a battered Stark watched as the Mark XLII helmet fell into the fire before him and broke apart. Suddenly, Aldrich Killian emerged from the flames with most of his own skin destroyed seemingly beyond Extremis' ability of reconstruction and still intent on Stark's death. Stark was now powerless and at the mercy of Killian, who proclaimed himself the Mandarin, saying that he was from the start.

Stark sees Pepper Potts kill Aldrich Killian
During this tirade, Pepper Potts, still alive due to the Extremis in her system, struck Killian to the ground with a large metal pipe, to which Stark was left speechless. The Mark IX armor flew downward in an attack position, and Stark failed to tell J.A.R.V.I.S. to disengage due to losing his earpiece. Potts then jumped off his knee to impale the suit and don one of its gauntlets. Stark watched as Potts sent Killian flying backwards and threw a missile at him, blowing it up with a repulsor blast.

Stark attempts to reassure Pepper Potts
With Killian and all the Extremis Soldiers now dead for good, Stark approached the confused Potts, who took a minute to realize the violence of what she had done while under the influence of Extremis. Stark and Potts teased each other about how he had thought she was dead while she joked about who was the bigger "hot mess" now. Stark apologized to Potts and promised to find a cure for her powers, joking that a relationship with him would always be a mess.

Stark initiates the Clean Slate Protocol
Seeing that Potts was still worried about their future together, Stark decided to give her another early Christmas present and finally ordered J.A.R.V.I.S. to destroy all his remaining Iron Legion armors in Operation: Clean Slate Protocol. Surrounded by the firework-like explosions in the sky, the couple embraced, with Stark asking if Potts was enjoying the show, which she said she did, as he accepted a life without such an obsession of being Iron Man.

Temporary Retirement
A Step Further
Stark shortly before his heart surgery
Stark was able to use his vast resources to cure Pepper Potts of the Extremis, removing her superhuman abilities. Stark used the cure to develop a method to extract the shrapnel within his heart without dying, and two days later, Stark underwent surgery from Doctor Wu in Hong Kong to have it removed.

Stark gives Pepper Potts a necklace
He used the pieces of shrapnel that had been removed by Doctor Wu to make a necklace, which he gave to Potts. Since Tony Stark's Mansion had been destroyed by Aldrich Killian and Eric Savin, Stark and Potts moved in together at Stark Tower, which he had now redesigned and renamed Avengers Tower ready if he would ever again need to rejoin the Avengers for a future mission to save the world again.

Stark prepares to begin his next chapter
Returning to his home's wreckage, Stark threw his Arc Reactor into the ocean, vowing that he was still Iron Man. He took the remains of his Dum-E and U to repair. Stark retired from the hero "business" for at least a year, but continued to work as a consultant for S.H.I.E.L.D. and run Stark Industries. He began helping S.H.I.E.L.D. by making repulsor technology for their three new Helicarriers, to avoid the issue that happened during the Attack on the Helicarrier.

Therapy Session
Stark sees that Bruce Banner is falling asleep
In the wake of his battle with Aldrich Killian and all of the stress he had endured from the Battle of New York aftermath, Stark retold the entire story to Bruce Banner in the Avengers Tower. Much to Stark's great annoyance, Banner had fallen asleep during the tale, telling his friend that he was not that kind of doctor. Stark ignored this comment and then began telling more stories of his life, much to the dismay of Banner, who proceeded to go to sleep again.

War on HYDRA
Project Insight
Tony Stark is targeted by Project Insight
Tony Stark was listed as another potential target of Project Insight by HYDRA. Luckily, Captain America was able to stop HYDRA in time to save all of HYDRA's intended victims. In the wake of the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D., Stark hired Maria Hill, utilizing his army of lawyers to protect Hill, in order to help him fill the void left by S.H.I.E.L.D.'s absence by privatizing global security. As a result of HYDRA's return, the Avengers were reassembled and Iron Man signed up.

Attack on the HYDRA Research Base
Iron Man tracks down HYDRA's leadership
As they tracked down HYDRA's current leader, Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, the reassembled Avengers came into conflict with Doctor Jensen in Sudan as she was using Chitauri weaponry. Working as a team, the Avengers defeated Jensen. With the help of Phil Coulson and the newly rebuilt S.H.I.E.L.D., Iron Man and the other Avengers attacked Strucker's HYDRA Research Base to battle HYDRA's leadership.

Iron Man fights Wolfgang von Strucker's men
While the other Avengers fought the soldiers on the ground, Iron Man worked on destroying the base's shields to allow the team access. When Iron Man swore during the mission, Captain America told him to watch his language, much to Iron Man's amusement. When the people of Sokovia began being targeted by all Strucker's guns, Iron Man ordered J.A.R.V.I.S. to send out the Iron Legion in order to get the innocent people back to the safety of their homes.

Iron Man breaks into the HYDRA base
Iron Man soon managed to disable the shields and entered the base; subduing all of Strucker's soldier's with ease. Once inside, Iron Man killed List who was attempting to delete his files before making his way through the hallways. Removing the Mark XLIII, Stark scanned the room in order to find a secret hallway, hoping to find all of Strucker and List's secret experiments, while being informed that during the battle Hawkeye had been badly injured.

Stark's mind is attacked by Wanda Maximoff
While Captain America had successfully captured Baron Strucker, Stark located inside the base the corpse of a Leviathan, which HYDRA had stolen after the Battle of New York, and the Scepter, which had last been seen in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s hands having been taken away from Loki. While Stark was looking at the Scepter and prepared to take it back into the Avengers' custody, Wanda Maximoff snuck up behind him and gave him a vision of the future with her powers.

Stark is given a vision of the Avengers' future
In the vision, Stark saw the Avengers lying dead after a mysterious battle against a powerful enemy. As Stark explored the battlefield, he saw the deaths of his team mates, with Captain America's Shield lying broken in half. Going to Steve Rogers, Stark was surprised when Rogers grabbed his hand, telling him that Stark could have saved them before dying. Stark looked up and saw the Leviathans and Chitauri heading to Earth through a portal in space.

Stark finds and recaptures the Scepter
Shaken by what he had seen, Maximoff allowed Stark to retrieve the Scepter, knowing its power would ultimately cause his own downfall. Unaware that he was now being watched by Maximoff and her twin brother Pietro Maximoff, Stark reclaimed the Mark XLIII gauntlet and used it to snatch the Scepter away, originally planning on giving it back to Thor to take back to Asgard to keep the Earth safe from its power, but Stark now had some new ideas about using it.

Creation of Ultron
Stark flies back towards Avengers Tower
With Baron Wolfgang von Strucker now in the custody of the United States Armed Forces, Stark flew the Avengers away from Sokovia onboard the Quinjet. Along the way, Stark asked Bruce Banner if it was okay for Doctor Helen Cho to set up all of her own equipment in his lab so she could begin the operation to save Clint Barton's life in the wake of his injuries during the battle.

Stark asks Thor for the use of the Scepter
As they came closer to their destination, Stark had put J.A.R.V.I.S. in charge of flying while he spoke with Thor and Captain America about what was to happen with Loki's Scepter now that they had finally recovered it from HYDRA. Stark requested that he be allowed the chance to study the Scepter before Thor returned it to Asgard to be kept safe, which Thor agreed with before they all discussed having a party to celebrate the capture of Baron von Strucker.

Stark returns back to the Avengers Tower
Upon arriving at Avengers Tower, Stark was greeted by both Doctor Cho and Maria Hill, with Stark correcting Hill when she called him boss, claiming that Rogers was the boss despite Stark paying for every they did. While the Iron Legion returned to the tower, Stark checked on Barton's condition while Cho used the Regeneration Cradle to repair his damaged skin tissue, with Stark teasing Barton that he was dying while Barton insisted that he would now live forever.

Stark and Bruce Banner discussing Ultron
Continuing his mindset toward protecting humanity while realizing the void that the downfall of S.H.I.E.L.D. created, Stark created an intelligence with the mandate to ensure global peace at any cost. The intelligence, Ultron, who in turn took control on the Ultron Sentries to defend humanity as a sort of makeshift army and allow the Avengers to retire. Seeking to push the Ultron Program forward, Stark recruited Banner by pitching the Program to him and showing him a detailed breakdown of the Mind Stone inside the Scepter, claiming that they could use its detailed brain waves to give life to Ultron, something they had failed to do in all of their past experiments.

Stark explains his vision for Ultron's future
When Banner expressed his doubts about the Ultron Program, Stark argued if they were successful, they could finally retire and Banner may not have to worry about facing Veronica. Claiming that with Ultron, the next Chitauri Invasion would never happen again, Stark told Banner that he had a vision of a suit of armor around the Earth, when Banner claimed this sounded like a cold world, Stark said he had seen colder, referring to Wanda Maximoff's vision.

Stark and Banner try to give life into Ultron
With Banner now onboard, he and Stark spent the next three days before it was returned to Asgard attempted to sync the Mind Stone from the Scepter into the Ultron Program in order to finally give life to Ultron. However, after three days of constant experimentation with the system, Stark and Banner admitted defeat, believing that there was no way for Ultron to be given life. J.A.R.V.I.S. recommended that Stark leave the project and attend to his party guests.

The Avengers Party
Stark hosts a party for all of the Avengers
At a party hosted at Avengers Tower, celebrating their recent defeat of HYDRA and the capture of the Scepter and HYDRA's current leader Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, Stark welcomed not only his own teammates, but also several allies of the team such as Sam Wilson and Maria Hill, with Doctor Helen Cho agreeing to attend the party as she had heard that Thor would also be attending. Stark also decided to invite several World War II veterans to the party who spent their time with Thor and Steve Rogers, drinking ancient Asgardian alcohol which got one attendee too drunk to walk.

Stark compares Pepper Potts and Jane Foster
While drinking with Thor, Stark listened as James Rhodes attempted to impress them with stories of how he had secured a tank while in his War Machine Armor, with nobody impressed. Stark and Thor then began debating if either Pepper Potts or Jane Foster was the more impressive girlfriend, with Stark noting all of Potts' work with Stark Industries which caused Rhodes to walk away with Rhodes, leaving Stark and Thor to continue the girlfriend debate alone.

Stark and all of the Avengers discuss Mjølnir
As the party went through the night, many of the attendees returned to their home, including Wilson, leaving Stark and the Avengers along with Hill and Cho as the only remaining non-team members there. As the remaining group joked and drank together around a table, they began to discuss Thor and his power to lift Mjølnir. As the debate went on, Clint Barton decided to try to lift Mjølnir himself, with Stark joking about him not being able to get it up. Stark then stepped up, joking that he wanted to rule Asgard if he picked it up.

Stark and James Rhodes pull at Mjølnir
Stark initially tried to lift it on his own, when that failed he called for the help of James Rhodes to no more avail, even with the Mark XLIII gauntlet. All the other Avengers then each decided to have a go at lifting the hammer, with Bruce Banner joking about Hulking out and Steve Rogers only slightly moved it while Natasha Romanoff refused it even try. Upon his defeat, Stark looked for fingerprint recognition software on the hammer which Thor still had denied.

Ultron Offensive
Attack on Avengers Tower
Stark witnesses Ultron's threats to them all
As the group laughed, a sudden loud ring echoed through Avengers Tower as they turned to see one of the Iron Legion robots stepping out of the darkness to confront them. While Stark tried to get J.A.R.V.I.S. to shut down the robot, it introduced itself as Ultron, claiming that it was there for peace in their time. When questioned about its true intentions, Ultron told them it intended to destroy the Avengers in order to achieve peace as they listened in horror.

Stark fights against the new Ultron Sentries
Ultron then sent out all his Sentries to attack the Avengers. Without his Mark XLIII armor to defend himself, Stark was quickly separated from James Rhodes and was forced to use whatever had come to hand to battle the robots. Grabbing a knife, Stark jumped onto the back of one of the many attacking robots that he had once designed himself and attempted to damage it's inner wiring in mid-air, eventually succeeding as they fell to the floor together.

Stark watches Thor destroying Ultron's body
In the wake of the brief battle, which concluded when Hawkeye had handed Captain America his shield which he used to destroy the final robot, Stark and the Avengers were faced with the main Ultron form. Refusing to listen to the robot's threats to them any longer, Thor then destroyed Ultron's robot body with Mjølnir, although one of its own Sentries had already escaped with the Scepter in its hand and had claimed that it would attack all of the Avengers again.

Team Argument
Stark examines the broken Ultron robot
With the Avengers now all gathered together, Stark began examining the Ultron robot to understand what caused it to attack them all. He listened closely as it was soon learned that Ultron had successfully accessed Avengers Tower's files and escaped through the internet, with James Rhodes and Maria Hill worrying that he may also gain access into the nuclear codes. When it was noted that Ultron had claimed to have killed somebody, Stark revealed that he had learned that Ultron had destroyed J.A.R.V.I.S.' mainframe in a rage.

Stark is confronted by Thor
While Stark and Helen Cho discussed Ultron's possible motives for turning against him, Thor then stormed in and grabbed Stark by the throat, accusing him of bringing destruction onto the Earth. Thor explained he had lost the Scepter, claiming Ultron was created by Stark messing with something he did not understand. As Stark had started to laugh, despite Bruce Banner telling him to stop, he claimed it was funny they did not understand why it was needed.

Stark discusses the future of the Avengers
Stark defended himself, claiming that he was coming up with a new solution to end the war that would destroy the Earth based on the vision recently given to him by Wanda Maximoff. Stark then recalled the Battle of New York, claiming that what was out in space would destroy them all if they did not plan ahead. As Steve Rogers claimed they could beat that threat as a team, Stark claimed that they would fail, with Rogers telling him they would still be a team.

Stark learns of Wolfgang von Strucker's death
Seeking leads, the team began searching for wherever Ultron was heading next and later learned that Ultron had built himself a new body and had murdered Baron Wolfgang von Strucker in his prison cell and had recruited the aid of Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Upon learning of Baron Strucker's death, it was noted that this was likely a smokescreen to throw them off, with all of their own information on Strucker having been deleted off their computers.

Stark discusses Ulysses Klaue's past history
Forced to use old S.H.I.E.L.D. files, the team researched anyone who was connected to Strucker who may be able to find a new lead. Stark soon pointed out Ulysses Klaue, noting that he had almost done a deal with him to sell Stark Industries weapons. Stark explained that Klaue was known for having a brand on his neck that marked him as a thief of Wakanda, the land where vibranium was made, so they all assumed that Ultron would go to him for the metal.

Hunting Ultron
Iron Man and the Avengers engage Ultron
Stark led the team to Johannesburg where they found Ultron, along with Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, taking the vibranium having just cut off Ulysses Klaue's arm in a fit of rage. Confronted Ultron, Iron Man attempted to talk him into surrendering, but Ultron refused, with the Maximoff siblings backing him up and insulting Iron Man's legacy. When Iron Man questioned what the vibranium was for, Ultron responded by suddenly and attacking Iron Man.

Iron Man battles against Ultron
They engaged in a fierce battle, with Iron Man taking on Ultron alone while Thor and Captain America fought the Ultron Sentries and the Maximoff twins, and both Hawkeye and Black Widow fighting against all of Klaue's soldiers who had come to defend their own employer following Ultron's assault on him. As their battle continued, Iron Man and Ultron flew out of the Churchill and across the Salvage Yard, still firing all of their own weapons at each other.

Iron Man successfully destroys Ultron's body
Eventually, Iron Man brought down Ultron and threatened him with a missile; however, Ultron revealed that he had already transferred his mind into another Sentry body and explained that the team had been mentally taken down by Wanda Maximoff, who had proceeded to cause Bruce Banner to transform into Hulk in the middle of South Africa and had started to destroy everything he could. Responding by destroying Ultron, Iron Man then went after Hulk.

Duel of Johannesburg
Iron Man sends Veronica to contain Hulk
Knowing that many innocent civilians would undoubtedly be killed in Hulk's rampage, Iron Man was forced to leave Ultron behind and called on Black Widow to try and calm Banner down, only to be told by Hawkeye that Romanoff was unable to go into battle. Iron Man called upon his Mark XLIV and Veronica in an attempt to subdue Hulk himself.

Iron Man suits up in the Hulkbuster Armor
However, despite soon being trapped inside Veronica's enforced and electrified metal cage, the enraged Hulk had soon managed to break himself free. Ordering the South African police to stand down from the fight, Iron Man tried to get through to Bruce Banner by telling him that Wanda Maximoff was messing with his mind, telling him that Banner was stronger and smarter than her. However, the mention of Banner's name only seemed to enrage Hulk even further.

Iron Man attempts to keep Hulk at bay
When all of Iron Man's attempts to calm Hulk down had failed, the two began to fight. Hulk launched a car at Iron Man, knocking him back, so Iron Man responded by flying to Hulk and dragging him face first through the concrete. When Hulk damaged the armor, Stark called for extra parts and used its many capabilities to try to knock Hulk down. With Hulk charging at him, Iron Man kept him at bay with his gauntlet beam while his arm was repaired.

Iron Man and Hulk punch each other
Hulk charged forward and the pair smashed their fists into each other, causing a shockwave through Johannesburg. Pinning Hulk to the ground, Iron Man began repeatedly punching him in the face and begging him to go to sleep and finish their fight; however, Hulk's rage only continued to build. Iron Man attempted to trap his arm with the Hulkbuster Armor and fly him out of the city in order to protect the people, with Hulk still fighting back.

Iron Man pushes Hulk against the wall
As Iron Man attempted to fly Hulk out of the city, he continued to fight back and forced Iron Man to crash land on the side of a large building. As Hulk tried to rip him apart, Iron Man pushed him against a wall and tried spraying gas in his face, although this tactic had almost no affect. As they continued fighting, Iron Man was aware that behind him an elevator filled with people were standing just feet away from the battle as they attempted to escape.

When he was kicked back with incredible force, Iron Man crashed into the elevator filled with innocent people, forcing him to catch it before it hit the ground as he ordered everyone to get out while they still could. Iron Man then proceeded to use the elevator as a weapon as he slammed it down onto Hulk's head. Once Hulk was stunned, Iron Man hit him across the face, knocking out one of his teeth, an action which Iron Man then soon regretted.

Iron Man manages to knock out Hulk
The enraged Hulk then proceeded to smash Iron Man across the city, attempting to rip out the Arc Reactors powering the Mark XLIV armor. Despite trying to get assistance from Veronica, Hulk proved to be too strong as he tore the armor apart. Eventually, Iron Man resorted to dropping Hulk through a building still going through construction; this massive impact seemingly calmed Hulk enough that Stark could knock him out with a final massive punch to the head.

The Barton Home
Stark updates Maria Hill on the team's state
With the battle over, the Avengers were flown away on the Quinjet. Stark spoke with Maria Hill who told him of all the reactions to the Avengers' actions in South Africa and talks for Bruce Banner's arrest. Hill also suggested that they should go somewhere to rest. Clint Barton told Stark to get some sleep because they would land soon. When Stark asked him where they were going, Barton responded to a safehouse.

Stark arrives inside Clint Barton's Homestead
They landed in a countryside and entered into a small house. The team was surprised to learn that it was Barton's family home and that he has a wife and children. Although Stark at first assumed it was a lie as Barton was a S.H.I.E.L.D. spy, Barton explained to them that the reason the team were still unaware of his family was due to Director Nick Fury helping him to have this second peaceful life just outside S.H.I.E.L.D. where his family could be safe.

Stark has an argument with Steve Rogers
Stark and Steve Rogers went outside and chopped wood together. They discussed how Wanda Maximoff had been able to use her new powers to pull the team apart. When the conversation moved to how Stark and Banner inadvertently created Ultron, they then proceeded to argue and debate on simply whether or not Stark should have ever experimented on Loki's Scepter. Stark explained his action by using the argument that the reason they fight is to end the fight.

Stark has a conversation with Nick Fury
Just as Rogers was making his point, Laura Barton then asked Stark if he could help to fix their tractor. While Stark examined the broken tractor, Nick Fury revealed himself; Stark realized that Maria Hill had called him. Fury tried to convince Stark that Wanda Maximoff had just tricked him, but Stark said that the vision he had seen where all of his friends are dead would be in the future, if Stark would not do everything he could to save them and all of humanity.

Stark plays a game of darts with Clint Barton
Having gathered together the entire team, Fury then showed himself to the rest of the Avengers and started to discuss their next move to stop the Ultron Offensive. Fury told them that his contact people in "NEXUS" in Oslo had informed him that Ultron had attempted to get nuclear codes but somebody was changing the codes all the time. While Stark played darts, being outplayed by Clint Barton, he told the group he would go to NEXUS to find Ultron's new enemy.

Stark discusses Ultron's next possible move
When Natasha Romanoff noted she had hoped Fury had more to offer, Fury gave them a speech to inspire them to get up and fight against Ultron, telling them to stand up and fight as a team once again. This led to them discussing Ultron's motives at which point, Bruce Banner then realized that Ultron wanted always to improved his body, so he needed Helen Cho and her Regeneration Cradle device to create his ultimate body which he could use to become unbeatable.

Hacking the NEXUS
Stark speaks with Steve Rogers and Nick Fury
Stark then made it clear to Steve Rogers that if Ultron succeeded in uploading himself to the synthetic body, he might be stronger than any of them. Nick Fury then told them that he will take Bruce Banner to the Avengers Tower and said to Stark that he needed Maria Hill. As the Avengers flew to Seoul, Stark was inside the NEXUS Internet Hub searching for the person who prevented Ultron from obtaining launch codes for nuclear missiles.

Stark successfully hacks into the NEXUS
While hacking into the NEXUS to find Ultron's new enemy, Stark was shocked to find out it was J.A.R.V.I.S., who erased his memory and had scattered himself all across the Internet to block Ultron. It turned out that Ultron was afraid of J.A.R.V.I.S. and of what he could do, so J.A.R.V.I.S. went underground and prevent from Ultron from getting the codes. Restoring J.A.R.V.I.S.'s memory, Stark then sent his own programming back towards Avengers Tower.

Birth of Vision
Stark reveals the survival of J.A.R.V.I.S.
Having learned what he needed to at the NEXUS, Stark then went back to the Avengers Tower where Bruce Banner and Clint Barton waited for him. Greeting Stark upon his arrival at the Tower, Barton was with the Regeneration Cradle with the synthetic body inside it. Barton informed Stark that Ultron had also successfully kidnapped Natasha Romanoff during the Battle of Seoul, so Barton began his search for her. Stark then told Banner everything he discovered and he asked for his help him upload J.A.R.V.I.S. to the synthetic body.

Stark and Bruce Banner discuss the new body
Banner was against the idea of messing with the body, finding the situation to be a time-loop they were all now stuck inside since first activating the Ultron Program; however, Stark argued that this was the right move and they did not have the time for the decision to be argued by the other Avengers. Stark was able to convince Banner that the new being Ultron had created could be a benefit by giving it J.A.R.V.I.S. as a core persona, and prevent megalomania.

Stark is confronted by Captain America
As the two were almost finished preparing to upload J.A.R.V.I.S. into the Cradle, Steve Rogers with Wanda and Pietro Maximoff came and ordered him to shut it down. Stark and Banner refused, shocked that Rogers had recruited the Maximoffs as they recalled how Wanda's powers had caused the Duel of Johannesburg. When Rogers tried to convince them, Stark argued that whatever had already happened was nothing compared to what was still incoming.

Stark attempts to fight off Captain America
To try and end the dispute before it got out of hand, Quicksilver then responded by speeding around the Cradle and unplugging all of the cables, until he was then subdued by Hawkeye's quick thinking. This action then led to a brief clash between the group, with Stark calling on parts of his Mark XLIII armor and shooting at Rogers, who in turn threw his shield at Stark, while Banner and Wanda Maximoff had a brief fight in which she knocked him back with her powers.

Stark witnesses the birth of Vision
Just as their fight was getting underway, Thor had suddenly charged straight into Avengers Tower and revived the synthetic body with a massive bolt of his lightning as Stark and the others looked on in shock and horror. The living body then jumped out of the Cradle and looked around its surroundings while the group looked on. The being then briefly attacked Thor until he looked out over New York City and calmed down as the Avengers moved down to speak to it.

Stark listens closely to Vision's speech
The living body apologized and called itself Vision and claimed to wish to assist them in their fight against Ultron. Thor explained that while in the Water of Sights he had seen Vision in his dream and the Mind Stone, one of the six Infinity Stones, that is in Vision's forehead. At first, the team did not trust Vision's motives, but as proof of his honor, Vision handed Thor Mjølnir. A shocked Stark was congratulated by Thor for creating a new worthy ally.

Stark and Vision agree Ultron hates him most
Having successfully tracked down Ultron to Sokovia where he was planning on using Wolfgang von Strucker's former base to begin his schemes, Stark and the other Avengers got themselves prepared for what could be possibly their final battle. As Stark was talking with Rogers and Banner, he noted that if any of the Ultron Sentries got away, then they had lost. When Stark noted Ultron was waiting for him, Vision confirmed that Ultron hated Stark most of all.

Stark listens to Captain America's speech
Getting onboard the Quinjet in order to fly to Sokovia and confront Ultron for the final time, Stark and the other Avengers listened as Captain America gave a speech in which he told the team that their priority would be to get the people of Novi Grad to safety before fighting Ultron's army. Looking at Stark, Rogers noted that Ultron believed the Avengers were what was wrong with the world, and this was their chance to prove that he was wrong.

Battle of Sokovia
Iron Man arrives in Sokovia to confront Ultron
The Avengers had eventually tracked Ultron down in Sokovia, where he had taken Natasha Romanoff to be held in a secret cell. Before leaving, Stark first installed a new AI, F.R.I.D.A.Y., into his newest suit as he no longer had J.A.R.V.I.S. to assist him. As the rest of the Avengers helped to evacuate the civilians out of Novi Grad and Bruce Banner went to free Romanoff from her cell, Iron Man confronted Ultron in the city's church right in the center of Sokovia.

Iron Man is found and confronted by Ultron
Ultron revealed himself to Iron Man, showing that he had created a new near indestructible body for himself made from the vibranium he had stolen from Ulysses Klaue, and a drill that had emerged from the center of the church which dug deep underground, also revealing a vibranium detonator with a mechanism located underground. As the machine was activated, Iron Man went to understand how to stop it while Vision then came to confront Ultron himself.

Iron Man flies above the rising Novi Grad
As Vision succeeded to disconnect Ultron from the internet. Ultron activated the drill and a part from the city flew to the sky. F.R.I.D.A.Y. informed Stark that if the city would get high enough, the impact of its fall to the ground would cause a global extinction. While all the Avengers fought against the Ultron Sentries and made sure that the civilians were safe, Stark and F.R.I.D.A.Y. debated about a way to make sure the city would not be able to hit the ground.

Iron Man saves a family during the battle
While flying around the still rising Novi Grad, Iron Man witnesses one building falling off the edge of the drop, with F.R.I.D.A.Y. informing him that there were still people trapped inside. Without a moment to spare, Iron Man flew into the building to find a terrified family, so he ordered them to get into the bathtub as he flew them down to the ground to safety. Iron Man warned Captain America of more Sentries heading his way, although Rogers was hit regardless.

Iron Man flies into battle with War Machine
Eventually through lots of planning with F.R.I.D.A.Y., Iron Man came to the idea that he and Thor can destroy the entire city in the air by attacking it from the top and the bottom. With it seeming there was no hope of saving all of the civilians, Nick Fury and Maria Hill arrived with a new Helicarrier and a fleet of Lifeboats, helping all of the Avengers with evacuating Novi Grad while War Machine helped with the battle as he and Iron Man fought the Sentries together.

Iron Man saves a falling Lifeboat
As Iron Man did all that he could to keep the Lifeboats filling with civilians safe, he continued discussing how to destroy Ultron's core, coming out with a plan to supercharge the inside from below. When one Lifeboat was damaged, Iron Man flew up and pushed it the rest of the way to the Helicarrier. Iron Man was informed by Thor that Ultron was now heading towards the core so Iron Man called on the Avengers to come together and stop him from activating it.
