<html><p>Enhanced Durability: T'Challa's bones and muscles are denser and is much more harder than a normal human being, which makes him incredibly durable. Even when not wearing his Panther Habit, he can survive extreme blunt force trauma such as being hit with the Winter Soldier's bionic arm with no visible injuries, and surviving the explosion at the Vienna International Centre despite being right next to the blast's epicenter with only minor injuries. During the Avengers Civil War, T'Challa was able to resist several of Black Widow's Taser Disks whereas a normal human would be knocked out by just one. During his pursuit on Ulysses Klaue, T'Challa was blasted down onto a casino table and exited the building unharmed.
Enhanced Speed: T'Challa can run and move at speeds beyond the peak of human potential, moving and running into the early levels of superhuman condition. Like his father, T'Chaka, he can run as fast as a zebra and outrun a white rhinoceros. He was able to catch up to and outrun speeding vehicles and outpace the running pace of Captain America and Winter Soldier respectively, eventually overtaking the Winter Soldier's motorcycle by using the vehicle Captain America hijacked as a springboard. T'Challa has proven to be slightly faster than Captain America, as shown during the Battle of Wakanda, when he ran at almost superior speeds with him when rushing towards the Outriders. During the Rescue of Nakia, T'Challa was fast enough to attack the traffickers even before they were able to aim their weapons on him. During the escape of Klaue, T'Challa was able to quickly catch up to the accelerating van but then he was blasted by a grande launcher fire by Killmonger. Upon seeing Killmonger was about to kill Shuri, T'Challa was able to run from one side of the battle field to another with extreme speed in a matter of seconds, successfully saving Shuri by tackling him and causing both of them to fall into the Great Mound. He also fast enough to stab Killmonger in the heart with a Vibranium Zulu Short-Spear before the former's nanite suit could reform. In combat, he was fast enough to go toe-to-toe with the fellow super soldiers like Captain America, the Winter Soldier and Erik Killmonger. During Battle of Earth, T'Challa was able to easily outrun all of the Outriders while holding the Nano Gauntlet to prevent them from getting it.
Enhanced Agility:     T'Challa acrobatically fights Captain America   T'Challa's agility is outstanding. He can coordinate his body with perfect balance, equilibrium, flexibility, and dexterity and leap or lunge great distances with extreme accuracy. He was able to lunge forward several feet when attempting to shield his father from the explosion in at the Vienna International Centre, and being able to reach the second floor of the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre Building faster than Barnes could walk up a set of stairs. His enhanced agility also allows him to effortlessly outrun and vault over moving vehicles. He was able to lunge forward several feet by vaulting over a moving vehicle and successfully pounce onto the back of the car which Rogers stole, and later lunge forward several feet by jumping from Rogers' car in an attempt to knock Winter Soldier off his motorcycle, as well as lunging forward several feet by vaulting over a vehicle moving in the opposite direction and successfully pouncing onto the back of Falcon. T'Challa was able to perform aerial wheel kicks while fighting Captain America, leap forward several feet to dodge an explosion and a large burning fire truck being thrown towards him, jump forward several feet trying to get a hold of the Quinjet. During the Rescue of Nakia, T'Challa was able to roll himself forward mid-air for several feet and land on a traffickers's truck with ease. During Manhunt for Ulysses Klaue, he was able to leap over to the top of the balcony with a single bounce, backflip several feet upwards and land onto a moving car controlled by Shuri with ease, and easily lunge and latch from one car to another while they were traveling at high speeds and taking out Klaue's henchmen. After being propelled into the air by a kinetic pulse, T'Challa was able to contort his body mid-air and land on the roof of a vehicle while it was traveling at high speed without any difficulty. When the car was blown away by Klaue's sonic cannon, T'Challa was able to jump and leap from that car to a height of several stories in a single bound, landing onto the ceiling wall of a neon sign and then successfully leaping onto the side the van wit ease. T'Challa was also able to jump over a height of several feet of the Border Tribe's defense shields. During the Battle of Wakanda, T'Challa was able to leap forward several feet alongside with Captain America to attack the Outriders, leap forward several feet to attack Cull Obsidian and successfully knock him down, and later Thanos, though he was able to catch him mid-air and knock T'Challa to the ground. During the Battle of Earth, he was able to leap several feet upward in attempt to secure the Nao Gauntlet but only to be ensnared by Ebony Maw's telekinesis.

Enhanced Stamina: T'Challa's musculature produces fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human and his body eliminates the excessive build-up of fatigue-producing chemicals in his muscles. He was able to intensely pursue the Winter Soldier on foot without any signs of fatigue, and fight against fellow super soldiers like Captain America, the Winter Soldier, and Erik Killmonger for an extended period of time without tiring, ultimately defeating the latter. During all those battles T'Challa have fought include Avengers Civil War, Battle of Mount Bashenga, Battle of Wakanda and Battle of Earth, he has shown without any noticeable sign of fatigue.
Enhanced Reflexes:     Black Panther catching Hawkeye's arrows   The heart-shaped herb enhanced T'Challa's reflexes, allowing him to effectively process the world at an accelerated rate. His reflexes were sharp and fast enough to dodge an explosion and a large burning fire truck being thrown towards him, evade a kick from enlarged Ant-Man, dodge many Hawkeye's arrows and even manage to catch them out of the air with his bare hands, stop Zemo from committing suicide using a gun at point-blank range, dodge gunfire from point-blank range by the traffickers, evade a blast from Ulysses Klaue's prosthetic arm, cover a grenade using his body the moment he saw it, catch a spear in mid-air, easily dodge an aircraft which was crashing towards him, dodge an attack by a charging rhino with ease, and even swiftly dodge a train moving towards him at high speed. His reflexes also allow him to respond quickly to fast-paced combat, as he was able to quickly dodge or block the attacks from the likes of Captain America, the Winter Soldier, Hawkeye and Erik Killmonger.

Regenerative Healing Factor: T'Challa's fast healing capabilities allows for him to have a conditioned metabolism that enables an extraordinarily efficient recovery. After being stripped away the powers of the herb, T'Challa suffered blunt force, cuts, and bruises due to fighting for the Black Panther monarchy. Afterward, having being restored the powers of the herb, T'Challa recovered from many of the damages he endured and was healed in a matter of hours. This even enables him to fully recover from being on the brink of death in mere hours.
Panther Habit Capabilities

Superhuman Durability: While wearing the habit, T'Challa's durability is increased to superhuman levels thanks to its vibranium composition, making him nigh-invulnerable, which allows him to withstand bullets and explosions while being completely unfazed. During the Battle of Mount Bashenga, T'Challa was able to withstand being hit by members of Border Tribe using their Vibranium Mambele, struck by a charging rhino, an immense fall into the Great Mound after he tackled Killmonger off of Shuri, Killmonger's kinetic energy pulses, even being hit by a Wakandan train while battling Killmonger but manage to quickly got back up, all without any injuries. During Battle of Wakanda,  T'Challa even able to withstand a strong punch to the head by Thanos, all without showing any sign of injuries.
Kinetic Energy Pulses: The habit can store kinetic energy, which T'Challa can then release in a pulse of purple energy. Using the kinetic energy absorbed from the bullets being fired at him, T'Challa was able to disable a car with an energy pulse expelled by the habit, using the propelling force to launch himself further into his pursuit. During the Battle of Mount Bashenga when he was overwhelmed by Border Tribe warriors, the habit gained an increasing amount of energy from their attacks that T'Challa was able to release as a much more powerful and devastating pulse, strong enough to send multiple enemies flying. During the Battle of Wakanda and Battle of Earth T'Challa used the kinetic energy to shoot down more soldiers of  Thanos' army. The habit can even generate pulses strong enough to knock back Cull Obsidian, the largest and strongest member of the Black Order.
Physical Augmentation: The kinetic energy stored within the habit can also be used to add more force behind T'Challa's blows, allowing him to increase the strength of his punches and kicks.
Abilities
Genius-level Intellect: T'Challa has a very high intellectual mind that is on par with some of the greatest scientific pioneers in human history, as seen by him being smart enough to have designed his own Panther Habit using his country's greatest resource with his own two hands.
Master Tactician: T'Challa has great knowledge of tactics and leadership, which he uses to great effect as both the King of Wakanda and the Black Panther. Due to his desire for revenge on the Winter Soldier, T'Challa planned an attack on Barnes in the short time when he was on the run. When battling Killmonger, he was able to strategically beat him by using his knowledge of the flaws in the vibranium suit, which he had Shuri utilized the Wakandan Maglev Train's sonic stabilizers to disrupt the vibranium technology in the habits to get the edge on his opponent in their rematch, ultimately defeating him and even impressing him. During the Battle of Wakanda, he was able to use his battle strategies to lead a Wakandan army and the Avengers against Thanos' Outriders.
Black Panther fighting an Outrider
Master Martial Artist: T'Challa is an incredibly skilled master hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist, having been trained vigorously from childhood to one day take up the mantle of the Black Panther, making him one of the most dangerous and best fighters on the planet. His unique Wakandan fighting style is very acrobatic and heavily attack-oriented, primarily utilizing powerful sweeping kicks, aerial takedowns, and slashing attacks with hooked and clawed fists, reminiscent of the manner in which a panther strikes. His attacks are fluid and swift, allowing him to transition from attack to defense rapidly. Black Panther's techniques combine African oriented martial arts and other styles, including Zulu stick-fighting, tiger-style kung fu, wushu, Dambe, Laamb, capoeira, Taekwondo, muay Thai, shurikenjutsu and intonjutsu. T'Challa has displayed the sufficient level of skill that in his fight with the Winter Soldier after the latter had swiftly beaten Tony Stark, Sharon Carter, and Black Widow, he was able to fight on par with Barnes and even pressuring him, forcing him to flee eventually. While wearing his suit, T'Challa was skilled enough to fairly quickly overpower and knock out Hawkeye who was using his staff while T'Challa was unarmed, best and almost kill the Winter Soldier, and even fight on par with Captain America himself, briefly knocking him down. He was also able to contend with Erik Killmonger while wearing his own Panther Habit and boosted by the heart-shaped herb, and eventually defeat him, although not without extreme effort. Even without the herb's power, T'Challa's skill and rigorous training in martial arts make him highly formidable and he is also accomplished with the use of Wakandan weapons, as displayed when he fought for the Black Panther monarchy. He was able to best M'Baku, the leader of the Jabari Tribe, and go up against Killmonger, initially having the upper hand, only losing due to the fact that he was hampered by his mercy and indecision to kill his cousin. T'Challa also managed to defeat many members of the Border Tribe during the Battle of Mount Bashenga, bested and killed many of the Outriders during the Battle of Wakanda, and bested and killed many members of the Chitauri and Outriders during the Battle of Earth.

Knife Mastery: T'Challa is highly skilled in using a knife in close combat. He used a dagger during the ceremonial duel for the monarch against M'Baku and later Erik Killmonger.

Shield Mastery: T'Challa is highly skilled in using his Nguni Shield.

Combined with his immensely enhanced agility, T'Challa has proven to be extremely agile and can perform highly acrobatic feats in combat, as he shown in his fights against Winter Soldier, Captain America, Hawkeye, M'Baku, Erik Killmonger and so on. He also used these skills to fight against hordes of enemies at once, namely the traffickers, Klaue's henchmen, members of Border Tribe, Outriders, Chitauri and Sakaarans. He also utilizes these talents for evasive purposes, as he was able to dodge many arrows fired by Hawkeye using acrobatic moves.

Equipment
Panther Habit

Panther Habit: As Black Panther, T'Challa dons a uniquely crafted vibranium-weave combat suit that, like Captain America's Shield, is lightweight, nigh-indestructible, and renders him immune to most physical damages, especially from collisions and conventional firearms, though the habit was notably susceptible to the electrical charges of Black Widow's Bite and vibranium weaponry. After his return to Wakanda, T'Challa received an updated version of the habit designed by Shuri to be more advanced than his traditional Habit, capable of absorbing and manipulating energy for various purposes. The updated version also facilitates extreme ease of storage, due to being constructed from vibranium nanites embedded in his necklace.
Vibranium Claws:      T'Challa swiping his claws   Two sets of retractable and extendable vibranium claws embedded in the fingers of the gloves like nails. The suit can also deploy claws from its knuckles. They serve as both utility and the primary combat weapon of T'Challa during combat. The claws are exceptionally strong and razor sharp. The claws are capable of damaging other items made of vibranium such as Captain America's Shield during his fight with Captain America.
Sneakers: The Panther Habit also equipped with sound-absorbent shoes, completely nullifying any noise T'Challa would make when walking.
