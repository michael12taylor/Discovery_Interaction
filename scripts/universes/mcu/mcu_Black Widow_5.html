<html><p>In the comics, Black Widow is the product of a Soviet Super Soldier experiment, and has had relationships with Bucky Barnes, Matt Murdock, Tony Stark and Clint Barton.
In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Endgame and Black Widow, Romanoff wore a necklace with an arrow pendant, as a symbol of her friendship with Hawkeye.
In Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episode Hot Potato Soup, Sam Koenig mentioned that Black Widow is the subject to a large amount of "steamy" internet FanFiction, with some people shipping her with Quake under the name “Quack.”
Behind the Scenes
Scarlett Johansson was pregnant during the filming of Avengers: Age of Ultron, so many of her scenes were scheduled early in filming before she began to show. To help hide her pregnancy later in filming, three stunt doubles were hired. This caused quite a bit of confusion among the other actors since, according to them, all of the stuntwomen looked very similar to Johansson. Chris Evans stated that it got to the point where he would say hello and start a conversation with one of them, only to realize that the person he was talking to was not Johansson. Ultimately, some scenes used CGI to hide Johansson's pregnancy.
The role of Black Widow was originally offered to Emily Blunt, but she turned it down.
Before given the role of Black Widow in Iron Man 2, Johansson wanted the role so badly that she dyed her hair red.
Scarlett Johansson was uncredited for her appearance in Captain Marvel.
Gemma Arterton, Jessica Alba, Jessica Biel, Natalie Portman, Eliza Dushku and Angelina Jolie were also considered for the role. Natalie Portman would later play Jane Foster in Thor, Thor: The Dark World, Avengers: Endgame and Thor: Love and Thunder and Angelina Jolie would later play Thena in Eternals.
Heidi Moneymaker, Bridgett Riley, Amy Johnston, Mandy Kowalski, Casey Michaels, Helen Steinway Bailey, Crystal Hooks, Tara Macken, Rebecca Bujko, C.C. Ice, Michaela McAllister, Dena Sodano, Lucy Jayne Murray, Mickey Facchinello and Martin Ivanov were stunt doubles for Scarlett Johansson in the role of Black Widow.
Dina Cataldi, Rachel Steele, Faye Sewell, Amanda Fordham and Alexandra Doyle were stand-ins for Scarlett Johansson in the role of Black Widow.
Megan Harwick was a photo double for Scarlett Johansson in the role of Black Widow.
In an earlier idea for Black Widow, Yelena and Natasha were adversaries and Yelena tried to dethrone her, but Scarlett Johansson didn't like it and thought it wouldn't work.
