After Parker told himself this, he noted to Beck that Stark gave him a message when he received the glasses, leading Beck to become in disbelief of that conclusion.

Parker tells Quentin Beck to keep the glasses
Parker told Beck that Stark knew every mistake he made so he must have known that he wasn't ready to fight battles bigger than him yet. As Beck asked why would Stark give the glasses to Parker, he told him that he was probably trusted with the power to choose Stark's successor with E.D.I.T.H. and not someone like Fury because he would just give himself the glasses. Parker emphasized that he needs to pick the next Iron Man who is an adult with experience and not himself.

Parker proudly gives Quentin Beck the glasses
Despite Beck refusing to handle control over the glasses, Parker decided to put them on and tell E.D.I.T.H. to have Beck gain access over the network.

Before Parker would elaborate, the item projected a momentary appearance of the Air Elemental.

Parker closely examines the projector
After the projection was over and startled the two of them, Parker investigated the device and deduced that it is an advanced projector. Given the image and technology, they had concluded the Elementals were all illusory projections.

After hurting himself by landing face front on the ground, Spider-Man heard Beck's voice about telling him not knowing what's real. Spider-Man was then transported into a miniaturized version of Queens but was punched in the faced by Mysterio's hand as it went through a building and crashed into a glass wall, hitting the many web-lines surrounding him until he landed on the hood of a car.

After being ejected out of the building, Spider-Man dropped himself to the ground and found himself in an empty lot. Being badly injured and afraid, Spider-Man witnessed Mysterio's drones again, as they descend upon him to resume the illusion of many shards of glass that stopped his tracks. Spider-Man was then alluded to imagery of himself and tried to touch one of the glass, but was taken out of surprise when one of them pulled him in. After escaping one of their grasp, Spider-Man met himself in another mirror that was about to attack him until he punched it in the face.

As more of himself as mirrors started to get out of the reflection, they attacked Spider-Man by piling him on top of him, taking off his Stark Suit until it was turned into his Homemade Suit. While Beck was taunting and berating him, Spider-Man then saw a series of statues that had the founding Avengers being shown to be broken in front of him but witnessed Mysterio as the one still standing. Spider-Man was then ambushed by Mysterio, but evaded his energy blasts while trying to attack him with his webbing.

Spider-Man is haunted by an undead Iron Man
Once Spider-Man shot his webs at Mysterio and tried pull him in front, he was tricked again as it was revealed to be another illusion and avoided the lifting crane he pulled. As Spider-Man dodged away more of Mysterio's energy blast, he felled down to the ground from the explosion he faced and saw a stature of a fist falling down on him, only for it to another illusion. Spider-Man then looked up to see Iron Man's gravestone in front him, as he was told by Beck that if he were good enough, maybe Stark would've been alive.

After pausing on Stark's gravestone to sink the notion harder, Spider-Man was then startled by a zombified hand, as Iron Man crawled out from his grave to horrify him. While Iron Man's head transitions itself into an army of Mysterio figures, Spider-Man found himself being lost and accidentally ran into another, hurting himself again. Spider-Man was caught off guard by noticing himself inside a snow globe, as he freaked out by the buildings coming out from closely.

As Mysterio kept playing with Spider-Man's mind, the illusion was cut off by Fury, once he shot him in the back. Spider-Man stood up as Europol agents surrounded Beck, while Nick Fury approached him to demand anyone who knows Beck's deceit, as they might expose him. Confused and pressured, Spider-Man named Jones and Ned Leeds as well as and maybe Betty Brant, but Fury laughed at him for being smart yet gullible. Confusing Spider-Man, Fury was revealed to be an illusion that Beck made to drop his guard.

With Beck telling Spider-Man that all of his friends had to die for knowing his secret, he resumed the nightmare illusion and steered Spider-Man away from his path. Spider-Man witnessed a barrage of illusions that changed his environment, such a room full of lockers, shards of glass, and a dark room of statues that are all falling apart as he sees, while Beck kept telling him that he really is sorry. As the illusion had ended, Spider-Man was suddenly hit by a train.

After being hit so hard by a high speeding train, Spider-Man managed to survived the impact of the collision with minimal harmful injuries and crawled back to the side of it. Spider-Man would finally gain access to the doorway of the train and waked forward inside, unmasking himself so that he could breathe heavily. Now further away from Beck's illusions, Spider-Man sat down on one of the seats to recover from his pain but was soon passed out from succumbing to his wounds.

Wondering into a remote field surrounded by tulips, Parker witnessed Hogan arriving in the Stark Industries Private Jet. Given the recent deceptions from Quentin Beck, Parker demanded Hogan to prove himself to be real, asking Hogan to tell him something only he would know.

While inboard the jet, Hogan was providing first aid to Parker, stitching up a wound on his back. After feeling too much pain from the suturing and being told to relax, Parker got up from his seat and angrily vented to Hogan about how he failed to stop Beck from taking the E.D.I.T.H. glasses away and now Beck will use it to kill his friends and other civilians. Calming himself down, Parker apologized to Hogan for his outburst and expressed how much he missed Tony Stark.

Taking a moment to think, Parker tearfully expressed how everywhere he went, he saw Stark's face and was asked if he was going to be the next Iron Man. Parker admitted he felt incapable of living up to his mentor's legacy. Hogan then reminded Parker that he'll never be Iron Man and that not even Stark could ever live to it. Hogan revealed that Stark always second-guessed everything he did, but never regretted picking Parker to be the next superhero to protect the world and be looked up to.

Once Hogan gave Parker the necessary motivation to focus on stopping Beck, Parker stood up and declared that he will kick Beck's ass. While Hogan asked Parker what to do when leaving, Parker noted that he can't call his friends because Becks tracking them and asked Hogan's mobile phone to find them. Knowing Flash Thompson had a livestream going on his school trip, Parker learned that his friends were in London, leading Hogan to prepare flying the jet.

Parker then asked Hogan that he needed a suit, leading Hogan to activate a hidden room with a suit synthesizer which Stark had left in for him. To the surprise of Parker, he commanded the machine to bring up anything it had on Spider-Man. Looking at the many Spider-Man Suit designs available, he focused on the designs of different Web-Shooters and while he was about to work on them, he looked over to Hogan smiling at his ingenuity.

Hogan told Parker to focus on the suit, while he handled the music for the occasion. While Hogan turned on Back in Black on the sound system, Parker mistaken the artist for Led Zeppelin upon taking off.

After finishing his suit design and waited for printing of it, Parker was told that he gave Nick Fury a code to let him know that he is being tricked into believing Beck's lies.

Parker explaining his plan against Mysterio
Once Hogan asked Parker how his plan would go, he explained that all he needs to do is go inside Beck's illusion tech so that he could take it down, find Beck, and take E.D.I.T.H. back into his hands. While Hogan counteracted his point about him being hit by a train, Parker noted to him about his sixth sense, having Hogan be familiar with it as the "Peter Tingle." Being told by his aunt's words, Parker told Hogan that does work, despite his unsure of its fully active. As Hogan left for the plan, Parker awaited for his new suit to finish.

Battle of London
Spider-Man and Happy Hogan fly into London
Arriving in London, Spider-Man rode on the side of the Stark Industries Private Jet, while Happy Hogan piloted it over to the city. While Hogan asked Spider-Man how he was feeling, he told him that felt great and even thanked him for complimenting his new suit.

Once Spider-Man told Hogan to get the jet high enough so that Mysterio won't see him coming, they were soon hoisted up in the air above the Elemental Fusion. As the jet has got enough air that is set in the plan, Spider-Man told Hogan that when this is done they must have a serious conversation with him and his aunt before letting go of the jet. As Spider-Man head dives into the Elemental Fusion above, he equipped himself with his new parachute to slow down his altitude and used his paraglider to move forward into through the illusion. 

Spider-Man enters inside the Elemental Fusion
After heading towards the illusion and telling himself that it isn't real, Spider-Man crashed into one of the Combat Drones that was projecting the Elemental Fusion, looking all over in awe of how the illusion was made so efficiently to prepare for such larger than life. Spider-Man then used his webbing to stick onto one of the Combat Drones he was holding on, and with his superhuman agility, created a linkage between some of them in a row, in order prepare setting them up for destruction.

Spider-Man partly destroys the illusion tech
Once Spider-Man was finished settling the webs to some of the drones, Spider-Man took a moment to dismount the last drone he was on. Spider-Man shot his web to set off the control of his taser webbing which detonated the amount of electricity being circuited within his webbing on some of the drones that were connected. Spider-Man landed on top of a Combat Drone and looked over to see the illusion being cut off as the drones were exploding.

After being hit against the wall and falling down to the ground, Spider-Man painfully gets up from the ground.
