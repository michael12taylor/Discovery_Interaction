Trivia
Rogers is 6'2" and weighs 240 lbs.
According to Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America/Steve Rogers is based on the comics version of his 616 mainstream counterpart. While the Marvel Cinematic Universe version of Captain America's date of birth is listed as July 4, 1918, the mainstream comics version's date of birth is July 4, 1922.
According to Anthony and Joe Russo, Steve Rogers' travel to the 1940s at the end of Avengers: Endgame created an alternate timeline, where he lived out a life with Peggy Carter, eventually traveling back to the prime timeline in his old age. However, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely gave a contradictory explanation, stating that Captain America did not create an alternate timeline, but rather traveled to the past of the same timeline, meaning that his life with Peggy Carter meant he had always been her husband in the original timeline, as well as the father of her two children.
In the comics, Rogers originally drinks the Super Soldier formula, while in the movie Rogers is transformed into Captain America through injections and radiation, designed by Abraham Erskine and Howard Stark.
Rogers' phone number is [].
Although it isn't shown, during the events of Avengers: Endgame, Rogers traveled to Asgard in order to return the Reality Stone and Mjølnir. That makes him the third known human after Jane Foster and Bruce Banner to visit Asgard.
Trevor Slattery has a tattoo of Captain America's shield on his neck, but instead of a star in the middle of the circles, is the symbol for anarchy.
Method Man mentioned Captain America in his song "Bulletproof Love" in the Luke Cage episode Soliloquy of Chaos.
The helmet he wears on his first mission is a homage to the Ultimate Universe WWII Captain America's helmet.
His triangular shield is based on the character's original shield, as well as the Ultimate version.
In the comics, Rogers has been shown to be worthy of wielding Mjølnir on four separate occasions, such as Thor #390, Fear Itself #7, Secret Empire #10, and Avengers Volume 8 #28. Rogers' Earth-93074 counterpart is also worthy, as well as his daughter from Earth-9811.
In Avengers: Endgame, when Rogers attempts to get the Scepter from Jasper Sitwell, he says "hail HYDRA," similar to what Steve Rogers said in the Secret Empire series in the comics, when it's revealed that Captain America was a sleeper agent for HYDRA.
Behind the Scenes
According to Anthony and Joe Russo, they had considered making Steve Rogers the living incarnation of the Soul Stone.
Though Chris Evans nearly turned down the role of Captain America, his close friend Robert Downey, Jr. convinced Evans to play the character.
Before Evans was cast as Captain America, Sam Worthington and Will Smith were in early talks for the role of Captain America. Later on Garrett Hedlund, Channing Tatum, Scott Porter, Mike Vogel, Sebastian Stan, Wilson Bethel, John Krasinski, Michael Cassidy, Chace Crawford, Wyatt Russell, and Jensen Ackles were on the final shortlist for the role. Kellan Lutz, Ryan Phillippe and Alexander Skarsgård carried out auditions in case Evans wasn't going to do the role. Sebastian Stan would later be cast as Bucky Barnes in the film, Alexander Skarsgård's father, Stellan Skarsgård, was previously in the film Thor as Erik Selvig and Wyatt Russell would later be cast as John Walker in the TV series The Falcon and The Winter Soldier.
In an alternate opening to The Incredible Hulk, Bruce Banner is attempting to commit suicide on top of a glacier, instead transforming into Hulk before he can do it, smashing the glacier. A freeze frame shot of the crumbling glacier shows Captain America in the ice, although this contradicts the canon, as Captain America was frozen within the Valkyrie.
Captain America has the most screen-time in The Avengers with nearly thirty-seven minutes. He also has the most screen-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron with just over fifty minutes.
Starting with his introduction in 2011, Captain America (and his actor Chris Evans) appeared in at least one film per year during the Infinity Saga: Captain America: The First Avenger in 2011, The Avengers in 2012, Thor: The Dark World in 2013, Captain America: The Winter Soldier in 2014, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man in 2015, Captain America: Civil War in 2016, Spider-Man: Homecoming in 2017, Avengers: Infinity War in 2018, and Captain Marvel and Avengers: Endgame in 2019.
It should be noted in Thor: The Dark World, it was not actually Captain America, but Loki taking on the form of Captain America.
