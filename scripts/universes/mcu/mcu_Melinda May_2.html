<html><p>Phil Coulson and she went to Portugal to retrieve Sif, who had lost her memories but was seeking something called "Kava". Skye found on YouTube a video of Sif fighting a man; May showed the video to Sif but it did not help her. While talking to Sif, May complemented the Asgardian on her skills as a warrior.

Eventually, the man was apprehended and revealed himself to be a Kree named Vin-Tak. He came to Earth because a Diviner had been activated and he wanted to destroy the Inhuman who had transformed. Vin-Tak told them that he caused Sif to lose her memory using his Truncheon. He used the device on Sif again, curing her amnesia.

May continued to listen as Vin-Tak further explained the origin of the Inhumans. When Skye was questioned about what she saw in Kree City as Raina transformed, she became nervous and caused the Playground to shake. May, Coulson, Sif, and Vin-Tak all realized Skye was an Inhuman. Sif and Vin-Tak both decided that Skye needed to be destroyed; May and Skye ran with them in pursuit.

May trying to calm Skye
May took Skye to Vault D and activated the Inertial Confinement Laser Barrier to be alone with her. May tried to talk Skye into using the calming techniques that they had practiced; however, Skye could not stop herself from causing the quakes. When Sif used her sword to break the barrier, Skye used May's I.C.E.R. to knock herself unconscious to keep from harming anyone. May used that act to get Sif to stand down, showing that Skye was not harmful to those she considered her friends.

May and Coulson escorted Sif and Vin-Tak away from the Playground so that the Bifrost Bridge could take them to Asgard. After they were gone, she and Coulson remembered how the first mission of Coulson's Team involved Skye and wondered if it was fate that brought everyone together.

Reunion with Andrew Garner
May in Andrew Garner's office
With it known that Skye was an Inhuman, Phil Coulson and May put her on the Index. A psychological assessment was a requirement for Index candidates, so May went to Culver University to request the assistance of ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. consultant and her ex-husband Andrew Garner. He told May that he would assist Skye, not her, not S.H.I.E.L.D. While in his office, she noticed a picture frame, but did not ask about it.

She brought Garner to the Playground, but asked him to allow her to speak to Skye first before his interview. May revealed to Skye that Garner was her ex-husband; this made Skye want to meet him to try to learn of May's past. After the interview, May and Garner had an amicable talk that Leo Fitz, who had not previously known that she was married, noticed made her smile and laugh. The conversation was interrupted by the Bus shaking; May awakened the sleeping Skye to stop the tremors.

Andrew Garner confronting May on the Bus
Meanwhile, Coulson and Bobbi Morse were dealing with a prison break orchestrated by Calvin Zabo to release David Angar. When Zabo and his Slicing Talons were located in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, May quickly took the Bus to that location to backup Coulson, despite Garner and Skye being on-board. May told them to remain as non-combatants, but Skye insisted on helping; May decided to use Skye's relationship with Zabo to her advantage.

Melinda May threatens to kill Skye
May brought Skye at gunpoint to the location of Zabo's and Coulson's confrontation; this caused Zabo to hesitate and explain his motives. Before David Angar could attack, Zabo was teleported away. May told Garner to take Skye off the battlefield as she ran to fight Francis Noche. She kept the super-strong villain from making contact as best as possible, but all fighting stopped when an earthquake started.

Back at the Playground, May told Skye that she would do everything she could to help her. Garner decided not to rejoin S.H.I.E.L.D.; as May escorted him off the grounds, he decided not to rejoin with her as well, because of the person in the picture frame.

May gave Garner's recommendation that Skye be relieved from field assignments to Coulson. They discussed that May was having difficulty working with Skye because May did not want to repeat what happened in Bahrain. Coulson assured her that she could adapt.

Suspicious
Alphonso Mackenzie returned to the Playground without Lance Hunter; when May asked why and if he saw Bobbi Morse while he was out, Mackenzie lied, telling May that he had not. May then called Phil Coulson and asked him to return from a S.H.I.E.L.D. Safe House where he had taken Skye.

May and Phil Coulson talk to Glenn Talbot
May and Coulson spoke with Glenn Talbot about his difficulties with Grant Ward and how, with assistance, he released Sunil Bakshi.

Turning their attention to more immediate matters, Coulson asked May if she believed Mackenzie's alibi; they did not and decided they would confront him.

S.H.I.E.L.D. Civil War
Deputy Commander Duties
May points her gun at Bobbi Morse
May found Bobbi Morse in Phil Coulson's office with the Toolbox in her hand, and she drew her gun on the intruder. Morse said that she could give an explanation, but then jumped through the window, hoping to escape. May pursued Morse and the two fought viciously; Morse activated an EMP to escape May in the resulting blackout.

May found Leo Fitz in the blackout of the Playground and the two found Coulson. The three compared notes; Alphonso Mackenzie was on the run and Morse had used a Vibranium tracking device to find the Toolbox. May remembered that Mackenzie was given the blueprints of the Playground earlier, but Coulson assured her that no one knew the facility better than they did.

Searching Morse's locker for where Morse would go if she left the base, May found a gas mask in a hidden compartment; she immediately realized that Morse was not leaving, but inviting an invasion.

May hid in the shadows as agents loyal to Robert Gonzales invaded the base. She listened as they discussed capturing Skye; May called Skye at the Retreat and warned her of the coming threat.

Shooting Gonzales with an I.C.E.R., May freed Coulson from his containment and sent him away through a hidden passageway before guards surrounded her. She chose to surrender.

Robert Gonzales' Proposal
May is questioned by Robert Gonzales
Two days later, May sat silently as Robert Gonzales attempted to interrogate her about the whereabouts of Phil Coulson or Skye, both of whom having escaped capture. He attempted to break down her loyalty to Coulson, reminding her of her previous directive to monitor Coulson for Fury and her subsequent order to terminate Coulson if he went insane, all because he could not trust himself. When he questioned if she was loyal to Coulson or to S.H.I.E.L.D., May responded that they are one and the same. Gonzales countered that Skye injured seven agents with her powers.

May defended her protege, insisting that the Diviner, not Coulson, was responsible for Skye's powers. Gonzales deconstructed that fact by reminding her of how GH.325 drove Coulson to the Kree City, but May defended that they went to stop HYDRA because it was their job, and argued that it is what S.H.I.E.L.D. should be doing instead of wasting their time on a witch-hunt. Gonzales held up the file of May's actions in Bahrain to remind her of the dangers of individuals with superpowers; this still did not make her talk. She promised Gonzales that Coulson would eventually face him on his terms.

Later, Gonzales took May aboard the Bus to the Iliad. He passed her his gun and told her to shoot him if she believed he was a traitor to S.H.I.E.L.D., if not, to hear his proposal. He asked May to join the leadership of his faction of S.H.I.E.L.D. as an advocate for Coulson, so that when he was captured, someone could understand and defend Coulson's motives against the other leaders. May gave Gonzales back his gun, saying that it was just for show; Gonzales emptied the clip and chamber of the loaded gun to show that he was deadly serious. May began to contemplate.

Return to the Playground
Aboard the Iliad, May was asked by Bobbi Morse and Anne Weaver if she could tell them about Deathlok and about Theta Protocol, but May gave only a little information about it. Morse and Weaver explained to her the massive investment of Phil Coulson on Theta Protocol and that the reason why they wanted to open the Toolbox was answers. May asked them if she could become the person in charge of the Playground and investigate those accusations.

On a Quinjet back to the Playground, Morse realized that May had no idea about Theta Protocol. As May returned to the Playground, she was greeted warmly by Jemma Simmons, whom May asked to assist her. They discovered that Coulson was commissioning Simmons to upgrade Deathlok without her knowledge, was having clandestine meetings with Andrew Garner, and was spending a lot of money. With growing concern, May ordered Simmons to open the Toolbox.

Finding Phil Coulson
May and Bobbi Morse
In Coulson's office, Simmons revealed to May that she worked on a fake Toolbox and the real one was with Leo Fitz. May told Simmons that she would handle it, and she told Bobbi Morse about Simmons' action. When she told Simmons what she had done, May asked Simmons if she could hack into Mike Peterson's hard-drive and see, through him, where Phil Coulson was. Simmons agreed to the question but with disappointment over May's actions.

May tried to convince her that her actions were the right thing to do in order to reveal Coulson's secrets. May, Simmons, Morse and Alphonso Mackenzie were in Coulson's office when Skye called. May asked her where she was and Skye told her she was with Calvin Zabo. May signaled to Simmons to locate Skye's location. Skye told May that she would not stay with Zabo much longer and S.H.I.E.L.D. needed to retrieve him before he hurt someone. Morse suggested that she take a team and retrieve Skye and her father.

Later, Simmons succeeded in hacking Peterson's hard-drive and they saw that Coulson was with Grant Ward.

Attack on the Arctic HYDRA Research Facility
Phil Coulson returned to the Playground with Grant Ward and Agent 33. Later, May, Coulson, Ward, Robert Gonzales, Bobbi Morse, Anne Weaver and Oliver had a meeting about Coulson's plan to infiltrate the Arctic HYDRA Research Facility, destroy it and rescue Deathlok with the help of Sunil Bakshi, a spy in the facility. Gonzales' board voted on whether or not to approve Coulson's plan. Before May made her vote, she spoke with Coulson about his previous lies and his meetings with Andrew Garner, but Coulson told her that the meetings with Garner were only for counseling on his alien writing compulsions. He assured May he would apologize to her at length after they had saved Peterson and the other powered people. May agreed to Coulson's plan and joined his infiltration team.

When Coulson, May, Jemma Simmons, Leo Fitz and Ward boarded the Bus, they heard a loud noise. May immediately pointed her gun toward Ward, but he said it had not been him. Skye appeared; teleported from Afterlife to assist their mission. On the way to the base, Coulson asked Ward to give the team the information about the base sent by Bakshi. As Ward was speaking, he quickly stopped and tried to explain his actions as an undercover HYDRA agent, but none of the team members were convinced of his choice. Near the base, HYDRA spotted the Bus' location and sent missiles to shoot it out of the sky, but the team escaped with a Quinjet and entered the base.

Once they were inside the base, the team regrouped with Sunil Bakshi and were split into two groups: Skye, Simmons, Ward and Bakshi went to save Mike Peterson; and May, Coulson and Fitz went to take down the defense system, so Robert Gonzales' men could destroy the base. May defended Fitz while he hacked HYDRA's system. When he succeeded, she looked for Coulson and found him hacking into another computer. She ordered him to leave, and once he had finished, he did. When the team saved Peterson and Lincoln Campbell, May informed Gonzales that they had succeeded in their mission.

One S.H.I.E.L.D.
During a meeting with Phil Coulson, Robert Gonzales, Bobbi Morse, Anne Weaver and Oliver on the Iliad, Coulson revealed that Theta Protocol was a hidden Helicarrier which, during the events in Sokovia, was activated and used against the threat of Ultron. Coulson suggested that the two factions unite into one S.H.I.E.L.D. where he would be Coulson and Gonzales' council would act as his advisors.

War Against the Inhumans
A New Threat
May aims her gun at Gordon and Raina
Later, May and Bobbi Morse spoke about how things had gone back to normal, but May did not believe that. May asked Morse if she thought that if she forgave Coulson, Lance Hunter would forgive her. Soon after, the ship's alarm was triggered and May and Morse found the invaders, Gordon and Raina in the cargo hold, where the Monolith was. However, Gordon teleported himself and Raina before they could be captured.

May and Phil Coulson argue with Skye
May was present in a meeting with Phil Coulson and his council, who discussed the new parties and the Monolith. Coulson and May returned to the Playground and asked Skye if she knew what the Monolith was, but she said neither she nor Lincoln Campbell knew what that was. May watched as Coulson asked more about the new group, but Skye only said they wanted to be left alone. Coulson asked how they should call them; Skye said they called themselves Inhumans. May claimed that the Inhumans were very dangerous, but Skye retorted that the same thing could be said about May. Skye told May that Jiaying had told her the story of what happened to the little girl and her mother in Bahrain, and revealed that the two were Inhumans.

May and Phil Coulson discuss the past
May and Coulson were in the hangar, and she told him she missed the Bus. Coulson told May that Jiaying was Skye's mother, but May did not respond. Coulson wanted to apologize to May, as he had promised, but May did not want to talk about it. She revealed what really happened to the little girl in Bahrain and the choice May had to make to save the agents' lives. May also claimed that Coulson had lost control when he carved the Words of Creation. Coulson said he had control, but May said that Skye was a living proof that he had not.

The next day, after S.H.I.E.L.D. found the Inhumans' settlement, Coulson and the council planned Coulson's meeting with the Inhumans' leader, Jiaying, and finding a solution to their conflict, but Robert Gonzales claimed that he should go to meet her because Coulson was too close to Skye. He gave the example of the Ultron's creation by Tony Stark, and how the Avengers had let one man do whatever he wanted. Coulson asked for May's opinion, and she said that Gonzales should go.

Ambush in Afterlife
May arrives at Afterlife
May flew Gonzales and Anne Weaver to the Inhumans' base with a Quinjet. She walked with Gonzales until he entered to meet Jiaying. She saw then Calvin Zabo arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D.. Skye asked her where Coulson was, but May told her there had to be someone objective to meet her mother. Skye said that Gonzales sent people to kill her a few weeks ago, but May said that he was a much better person than she thought. May told Skye she hoped her mother was everything Skye had wanted her to be.

As a seeming peace-keeping gesture, Jiaying handed over Calvin Zabo to S.H.I.E.L.D. to be punished for his many crimes before beginning with discussions with Robert Gonzales. Once Skye had dropped off her father and as Zabo was being handcuffed and searched by Anne Weaver and her team, May informed Phil Coulson that the Inhumans had turned over Zabo. Not quite understanding what this could mean, Coulson told her that they would deal with that later.

War Started
May discusses Robert Gonzales' action
May informed Phil Coulson that Bobbi Morse had not arrived yet nor answered her. Coulson asked how Skye was, and May replied she was disappointed that he did not meet Jiaying. Jemma Simmons came and said that Robert Gonzales had allegedly shot Jiaying. Coulson asked her where Gonzales was now, but Simmons did not know. He ordered the agents to find Gonzales and rescue him, so May ordered the agents to be prepared to take off when she returned and warned them about Calvin Zabo, who might be somehow involved.

May found Skye fighting against an agent, so she ordered her to stand down; Skye claimed that May needed to stand down, after Gonzales shot her mother. May asked where he was so they could fix this, but Skye said it was too late for fixing; May needed to take her people and get away from there. May said she would leave after she found Gonzales, but Skye did not let her keep going and eventually, the two fought each other. Skye used her Inhuman powers to knock May out.

May awoke in a Quinjet to the singing of Calvin Zabo. She joined the argument of Coulson, Simmons and Anne Weaver about whether or not Gonzales attacked Jiaying. After Weaver cut off, Coulson said he could not believe Skye turned against them; May said he did not see Skye attack her. Coulson understood Skye's confusion and Simmons asked why Jiaying had invited S.H.I.E.L.D. only to attack them. Coulson said that he did not know why but maybe Zabo did.

Kidnapping of Bobbi Morse
May and Lance Hunter on find the Quinjet
After they returned to the Playground, Coulson discovered that the attack of S.H.I.E.L.D. on Afterlife was actually an order of Jiaying to her men to attack their home, so her people would think that they declared war on them. Lance Hunter and Leo Fitz then entered and said that Bobbi Morse was taken by Agent 33, disguised as May, on a Quinjet which landed in Spain. Hunter asked for a pilot, and May volunteered to join him. Coulson followed with them and their team and realized that Grant Ward left Agent 33 for this reason.

May said that she was planning to kill Ward once and for all. Hunter and May found where Morse's Quinjet landed and they saw signs of a struggle in the plane. May comforted Hunter by saying that Morse could handle herself against Ward. While they flew there in their Quinjet, Hunter discovered that Morse's phone was back in service and it should not be a problem to find her location. May said that it could be a trap, so Hunter asked if she was ready. May said she had an opportunity to kill Ward, so she was all in.

Tricking Grant Ward
May tricks Grant Ward
May, Lance Hunter and their team raided the building where Bobbi Morse was held. May took two agents to search for Morse while Hunter took only one. During her search, she came across Agent 33 and started shooting at her, but Agent 33 avoided her shots. May noticed that Agent 33 had stolen a radio from a knocked out agent, so she had an idea how she could make Grant Ward kill Agent 33.

She then issued a call on the radio for all agents to move to the south side of the building and only lower their guard once they saw her face, knowing that Agent 33 listened to this call. An agent near to her said that only Hunter was left and May responded that Agent 33 didn't know that. Eventually, her plan worked and Ward killed Agent 33 as she had disguised herself as May. May found Hunter holding Morse while she was badly wounded and bloody. She helped him to take her to the Quinjet.

Hijacking and Retaking of the Iliad
Before they landed in the Playground, Bobbi Morse stopped breathing, so May resuscitated her. Once they landed, she and Lance Hunter brought Morse to a room for surgery by Jemma Simmons. As she saw Morse recovering but still in a coma, May made a phone call to Andrew Garner. As soon as he answered the call, May said that he just wanted to hear his voice. Garner knew that something was wrong, saying that May had not made a call like this since Bahrain. He asked her how bad the situation was, and she responded that there was no way it was ending well. She also said that there was a lot she had not said that she wished she had. Garner said that he had too. He asked her to do good and to get home safe.

The Inhumans hijacked the Iliad and captured most of the crew, and a distress signal was sent from the ship to all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s channels around the world. Phil Coulson organized a squadron of Quinjets to fly to the ship and shut down the Inhuman threat. May was with Coulson and Leo Fitz in one of the Quinjets along with Calvin Zabo, although May told Coulson she had doubts of bringing Zabo on the mission. Coulson responded that Zabo had lived among the Inhumans so he knew what they were going into and he could be useful for them. Fitz recognized a code being included in the distress beacon, which Coulson knew was a message from Skye warning them they were going into a trap. Coulson ordered the other Quinjets to fall back while his own continued on.

May joins the Retaking of the Iliad
As they landed on the ship, Fitz said that another message from Skye had came saying there were synthetic Terrigen Crystals and they must go to the room which controls the ventilation of the ship. Zabo said that Jiaying's plan was to gas the ship with the Terrigen Mist and kill all of the agents. Coulson and Fitz went to find the Crystals while Zabo went to find Jiaying. May went to the ventilation control room. On her way, May came across with Lincoln Campbell and they teamed up to save Skye from Alisha Whitley's duplicates. Once they saved her, Skye went to find Jiaying while May and Campbell continued fighting Alisha and her duplicates, until they succeeded in knocking her out. Skye and S.H.I.E.L.D. were able to stop Jiaying's plans, leading to the deaths of Jiaying and the teleporter Gordon.

Time Off from S.H.I.E.L.D.
May takes a time off from S.H.I.E.L.D.
With the War Against the Inhumans finished, Andrew Garner spent a few days in the Playground for Phil Coulson's evaluations. They agreed that May should take time off from her duty as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.; Garner revealed that they will travel together. May then asked Coulson, for the first time in her life, for a confirmation for timeout from S.H.I.E.L.D.; Garner and Coulson discussed this and Garner said that was time for her to rediscover the world outside S.H.I.E.L.D.. May then emptied her locker and took her gun with her, just in case.

Coulson felt that he lost his right hand as well as his left, when May did not return from vacation after a few months of absence.

Vacation with Andrew Garner
May in Hawaii with Andrew Garner
May and Andrew Garner did their vacation in Maui. On the last scheduled day, Garner took an impromptu picture of May as she watched the sun set. They began talking and she decided that she wanted to continue to be on vacation in order to continue the rekindled spark between her and Garner. Garner agreed and asked May if they could exclusively date again.

Suddenly, Garner refused to see her and returned to teach in Culver University. She also got a call from Phil Coulson and he told her that Jemma Simmons had been swallowed by the Monolith.

Father-Daughter Times
May heard that her father, William May, had broken his hip in a car accident. May was afraid that Grant Ward was involved in the accident, so she went to guard him in his house in Sun City, Arizona. She covered her motive from her father by saying she was with him to help him recover his hip, although her father knew she was hiding something.

May in her father's house
They played golf and William commented on her hits. May said that he needed to work his hip. William revealed to her that he did not believe that she was with him only to help him recover. He knew something was not right because she returned from her vacation with Andrew Garner to spend time with him. May kept her silence, so he said that he would figure out by himself what was the reason.

Later, May and her father looked at an old picture of her, at the time she was an ice-skater, and they talked about her childhood. Suddenly, May saw a man coming to the door. May picked up a knife, surprised the man and neutralized him, but she saw that it was Lance Hunter.

Lance Hunter's Request
May thinks about Lance Hunter's request
May and Hunter sat in the yard, and after Hunter explained how he found her and the rumors of May's departure from S.H.I.E.L.D., he said that he needed her help to find and kill Grant Ward. May initially refused, saying that her father needed her. Hunter was aware of the accident, and he knew that May was concerned that maybe Ward was behind it and that is why she was with him. May asked how he was going to kill him and he responded that he will climb the ranks of HYDRA until he was close enough to Ward to put a bullet in his head. He told her where he was going to be if she changed her mind to join him.

May then returned to the house where her father asked if Hunter's visit was an unfinished business. May remained silent, so he knew she meant yes. May said that she wanted to know if she could have a normal life without S.H.I.E.L.D., but her father said that it was not possible if she always expected an attack.

Revenge on Grant Ward
Fight Club
May eventually decided to join Lance Hunter in his campaign for vengeance against Grant Ward for the Kidnapping of Bobbi Morse. May then took a phone call from Andrew Garner, where he informed her that Jemma Simmons had been rescued and was safely returned to Earth. May relayed the information to Hunter, who praised how smart Leo Fitz was and insisted that he and May celebrate over a beer.

May accompanied Hunter, under the alias "Gina", to a bar to meet Spud, an associate of Hunter who worked with HYDRA in the United Kingdom; their cover was selling weapons to HYDRA and wanting to meet its leader. Upon meeting her, Spud felt that "Gina" looked too good for the likes of Hunter.

May and Lance Hunter drink with Spud
May wanted to talk business, but the men insisted on drinking first. Eventually, after they were so drunk they could hardly enunciate, May was allowed to tell Spud that she and Hunter had powerful weapons that they wanted to sell. Spud informed them that to get an audience with the leader, they needed to win in the fight club that was established for new members to prove themselves.

Waiting for the established time, May offered to fight instead of Hunter; Hunter noted that a small Asian woman with remarkable fighting skills would get the attention of Grant Ward too soon. May then offered to train Hunter; he planned to tire out his opponent, but he took the brass knuckles May had. Discussing her relationship with Andrew Garner, May revealed that she was not the one who left him in Maui.

Entering the warehouse where the fights occurred, May and Hunter noted that the fights were to the death. When Hunter entered the fighting circle, Spud was his opponent; he began beating Hunter mercilessly.

May found herself surrounded by three huge men led by Tat, who insisted on buying her drink. Though she refused, they made their desires clear. May took the three to an adjacent room, then proceeded to demonstrate her superior fighting skills on them. She, needing to keep her cover, told them that they would be embarrassed if they let it be known that a little Asian woman beat them. May returned to the fight circle in time to see Hunter use the brass knuckles to kill Spud and gain entrance to its higher levels.

Backup
May argues with Lance Hunter
A week later, Lance Hunter got an assignment from Kebo. He had no idea what the assignment was or where it would be; May berated Hunter for going to a mission ignorant. The two agreed that they both wanted Grant Ward dead; however, Hunter was going to have his revenge, no matter the cost.

May returns to the Playground
May went to the Playground and alerted Phil Coulson that Hunter was in a situation too deep for her to handle alone. Coulson assured her that he would assist when needed; he also wanted to know if his working with Andrew Garner was what caused her not to return. May was not considered about that, only that Hunter was in danger. May noted that Coulson was not wearing a tie; showing her his prosthetic hand, Coulson said he was stilling learning.

May refuses to speak with Andrew Garner
Garner caught May as she was leaving; he wanted to talk, but May had few words. Garner told her that he had a good time with her in Hawaii. Garner explained that it was his fault that things did not go well, but May insisted he just did not love her. He told her he was to blame for why they separated again; May agreed, citing that it was payback for when she had left him herself years ago. Garner asked her to dinner, but she refused and left.

May helps Lance Hunter fight Grant Ward
May followed Hunter to his rendezvous with Kebo and killed five of the eleven HYDRA operatives surrounding Hunter as he attacked Grant Ward. During the assault, May called Coulson, but he said he was twenty minutes away and recommended that they escape; Hunter refused and pressed the attack. Ward revealed that he had Andrew Garner surrounded, but he would release him if Hunter allowed Ward to escape. Once again, Hunter refused, despite May's concern for her ex-husband. Ultimately, Ward escaped, leaving May angry.

Return to S.H.I.E.L.D.
May and Lance Hunter returned to the Playground, timely enough to see Andrew Garner in a gurney and being helped by S.H.I.E.L.D. medics. May asked Garner how he survived the assassination attempt; he revealed that Phil Coulson had sent an agent to tail him, who engaged the HYDRA operatives who pursued him. Garner then told a tale of how he escaped. Deciding to allow the medics to care for him, May left Garner and ran into Hunter who had wished to see Garner; May adamantly refused to allow that. Coulson exited the room and saw the conversation; he took Hunter off the assignment for his failure and emotional issues.

May testing Bobbi Morse
May went to where Bobbi Morse was doing her rehabilitation routine and attacked her. Morse and May fought until Morse pinned her. May congratulated her on passing her test for combat readiness; Morse said that she was not medically cleared, but May dismissed her excuse. When the women saw Coulson, he asked May had she returned to the agency; May declared that she was back.

Search for Werner von Strucker
May revealed to Bobbi Morse that she had researched the attack on Andrew Garner and had learned that Werner von Strucker was one of its participants. She also had learned that Strucker had activated a bank account in the Cayman Islands. After assuring that Morse knew how to speak Mandarin Chinese and that Leo Fitz had made appropriate aliases for them, May and Morse went to Grand Cayman Island.

"Katelin Frayer" and "Shu Wong"
There, May pretended to be a socialite who only spoke Mandarin and had Morse as a translator; in reality, May and Morse were communicating secretly. The two met Jerome Deschamps who left them alone in the bank vault. As they were going through Strucker's lock box, an alarm was activated and Deschamps returned with security. May, in Mandarin, told Morse to prepare for battle, but Morse tried to talk her way out of the situation. One of the guards was not fooled and a fight to escape the bank happened anyway. Later, May chided Morse for hesitating in battle and told her that she was better now than when she was in S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy because Morse now has the "experience" from the incident with Grant Ward on her side.

May and Morse discovered that Strucker was in a Penthouse in Lisbon, Portugal. The two kicked in the door and saw Kebo torturing the young man. Kebo remembered May from the Attack on Grant Ward she performed earlier, stabbed Strucker, then attempted to escape. Morse gave pursuit while May fought and defeated the other HYDRA operatives.

Andrew Garner's Secrets
Finding Out About Lash
May hears the truth about Andrew Garner
May removed the restraints that were holding the gravely injured Werner von Strucker and demanded that he reveal the location of Grant Ward. Strucker started to breathe heavily and, upon hearing Ward's name, told May that he was trying to follow directions and feared Ward because he failed in his Attack on Andrew Garner. May requested to know the truth about the incident and Strucker slowly told her of how Andrew Garner transformed and killed his HYDRA teammate before Strucker barely escaped; May was in disbelief. When asked what Garner was, May answered that she did not know.

Confronting Andrew Garner
Returning from Lisbon, May struggled to believe that her husband was Lash. She realized that she could check Werner von Strucker's story, immediately searching for Garner's flight records. She learned that Garner had been within thirty miles of several Inhuman deaths. May went to the lab and found Garner's medical file, but could not find his blood samples, all but confirming von Strucker's story. Asking where Garner was, she learned that he was in a different S.H.I.E.L.D. facility reassessing Joey Gutierrez. May immediately left to find him.

May confronts Andrew Garner
At the Cocoon, May pushed her way past several guards and interrupted Garner as he was interviewing Gutierrez. She ordered the others from the room, and told Garner that von Strucker was alive, and that he had told her that Garner was Lash. She also informed him of her search into his records. As May confronted him, Garner grew unstable, drew an I.C.E.R., and shot May unconscious.

Kidnapped
May awoke in an old building at Culver University, chained to a water tank. Immediately, Andrew Garner ran to her side and apologized for her treatment, saying that he had needed to get away from S.H.I.E.L.D. to explain. May listened as Garner explained when and how he had undergone Terrigenesis, and his first transformation into Lash. She asked if Garner would have killed Joey Gutierrez; he assured her he would not have. May and Garner reminisced about their relationship, and the two shared a kiss, only to be interrupted by Phil Coulson.

May assured Coulson she was all right, then watched as Coulson informed Garner that he wished to bring him in safely. Garner explained to Coulson that he had only done what he needed to do; suddenly, the lights flickered and burned out. May watched as Lincoln Campbell entered, angrily claiming Garner had torn his friends apart and had no right to do so. Garner, in a rage, transformed into Lash as May watched, sadly accepting what her former husband had become. As Garner and Campbell fought through the building, Coulson gave May a file, which she used to escape her chains.

May calms down Lash
Following the battle, May blocked Garner's path just as he was about to kill Campbell. May begged Garner to stop and asked that he kill her, noting that she never would have thought he would be the reason she died. May told Garner that she had never known why he had married her, and assured him that she would not walk out on him again. Her words caused Garner to revert to human form, and as he stood before her, May shot him in the chest, knocking him back into the Containment Module and closing the door just as he transformed back into Lash. May watched as gas from the chamber sedated Garner.

May flies away in a jet
With Garner sedated and safe, Rosalind Price offered May the chance to have Garner put in a medical coma to slow his transformation. May asked Daisy Johnson what she would do; Johnson replied that she would take the chance. May told Price to do it, then walked away.

Apologies
May returned to the Playground saddened and angry. She attended a meeting and listened as Phil Coulson described Operation Spotlight. Learning she was in charge of extracting Lance Hunter and Bobbi Morse, she requested Lincoln Campbell as her partner in the mission.

Melinda May with Lincoln Campbell
On the Zephyr One, May listened as Hunter and Morse infiltrated Endotex Labs, and left to extract them in a Quinjet with a reluctant Campbell following. In the Quinjet, she tried to find words to apologize for Lash's killing Campbell's friends, only to have Campbell confront her over her silence. May told Campbell that she was sorry for Lash's killings and that she should have known. Campbell told her that he should be thanking her for shooting Lash; he was interrupted by a warning that the extraction needed to be sped up. May increased the Quinjet's speed.

At Endotex Labs, May successfully extracted Morse and Hunter, along with Luther Banks, who had helped them to escape.

Back to the Field
Attack on the HYDRA Castle
May is interrogated by Phil Coulson after the Assassination of Rosalind Price
After Rosalind Price was assassinated by Grant Ward, Phil Coulson interrogated his original team members in order to find a weakness in Ward. May expressed her condolences to Coulson and was asked about her intimate moment with him. May told him that the had not talked so much.

As Coulson went to find and kill Ward, he appointed Alphonso Mackenzie to the acting Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. by the time he was missing. Mackenzie asked about May opinion about Andrew Garner's evaluation on Lincoln Campbell, but she replied that she was not sure whether Garner had written that or Lash. She saw satellite photo of the HYDRA Castle, where Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons were held by Ward and Gideon Malick. Mackenzie, knowing he was outmanned and outgunned, did not know what to do, so May told him that she thought he knew what to do, implying to activate Caterpillars project. May listened to Mackenzie as he tried to convince Campbell and Joey Gutierrez to join their mission and stopping HYDRA. After they agreed, May complimented his speech.

On their way to the castle, Daisy Johnson discovered that HYDRA brought to the compound dozen Inhumans inside Suspension Gels. May thought that Garner might be there as well. Mackenzie suggested that two teams would enter the castle, one for finding Fitz or Simmons and the second to secure the portal chamber. Johnson also discovered an aqueduct which led straight to the castle.

May learns that Lash is inside the HYDRA Castle
As they entered the aqueduct, May went with the Secret Warriors to find Fitz or Simmons. They hided in the castle's field and May managed to take one soldier down. Johnson warned them from Giyera and Campbell and Gutierrez revealed their fears. Johnson tried to calm them down by saying they all feared, but May said she was not. Campbell used his powers to turn off the lights. The Secret Warriors entered the castle and May stayed outside. When a soldier found Simmons, May threw at him a knife. May asked about Fitz and Simmons said that Grant Ward had taken him through the portal. She also told May that Garner was there and he had saved her life. May said to Simmons that she did not want to look for him and she informed Johnson she found Simmons.

May searches for Lash
However, May did searched for Garner, and she found out that he had killed all the Inhumans that were in the castle. She entered the portal chamber and informed the team what she had found and also that she could not find a difference between Garner and Lash. As HYDRA tried to entered the chamber, Mackenzie ordered May to take the team to Zephyr One, and blast the castle in case Hive would return to Earth or HYDRA would enter the room. He also told them that May would be Coulson if he died.

Mackenzie and Johnson stayed in the chamber and waited Phil Coulson and Fitz, while the team returned to Zephyr One. May readied the rockets to be fired, and Mackenzie ordered her to shoot them at the castle, as he returned in the Containment Module to the plane with Johnson, Coulson and Fitz. While the group were reunited with each other and celebrated their victory over HYDRA, May embraced Coulson, knowing he had killed Grant Ward for good.

Comforting Phil Coulson
May accompanies Phil Coulson
Phil Coulson and President Matthew Ellis had a meeting in Rosalind Price' apartment. May said to him that it was probably not easy for him and asked him why the meeting was there. Coulson responded that he wanted the President would see where Price had been killed and that he did not want to give the location of the Playground. The President entered and the two were talking about the Advanced Threat Containment Unit would serve as S.H.I.E.L.D.'s public face. As Coulson asked him if he could help him finding Gideon Malick, the President said he could not. May then said she was sorry for that, but Coulson responded that the President might helped him.

May comforts Phil Coulson
She then helped carrying Werner von Strucker to the Theta Brain-Wave Frequency Machine, so he could help them find Malick. After Coulson found a way to communicate with Malick, May found out where the phone was connected. Later, May and Coulson were in his office and May felt his new robotic hand. May saw that he was upset, so she said to him that maybe he could not overcome this feeling. Coulson said he did not know what had happened to him on Maveth, and May said that he joined the Calvary. The two watched as the stocks of Malick's company dropped. May said that sometimes you get hurt and sometimes you wound.

Infiltrating the Taiwan Symposium
Under the guidance of May, Lincoln Campbell protected Phil Coulson during his meeting with Glenn Talbot, the new head of the Advanced Threat Containment Unit. May advised Campbell to blend in the best he could while she watched him through CCTV, when Campbell caught sight of General Talbot, he joked about his terrible haircut until he spotted someone seemingly following the pair, warning May that it was not a joke this time. Campbell then suspected someone who followed Coulson. May discovered it was Carl Creel. She warned Coulson about it and ran to defend him. She tricked him into turning into metal. Campbell's powers almost killed Creel until Coulson ordered him to stop. When Talbot was freed, he revealed that Creel was not attacking them but was now Talbot's personal bodyguard.

In Coulson's office, his agents disagreed with him that Creel should join the mission to the Symposium on Alien Contagion. May noted that Creel had a criminal record long before he joined HYDRA. Eventually, Coulson accepted Creel to the mission. He asked May to accompanied Talbot to Creel. On Zephyr One, she informed Lance Hunter that the briefing was about to start. She saw him watching Creel and he said that he still did not trust him after he had killed Isabelle Hartley and Idaho. She said to him that the mission was more important, but he said that he was tired to hear that, since it was not valid when it had come to Andrew Garner. She stated that the only reason he called himself an agent was because of Bobbi Morse. He said that he was a friend who tried to keep her save, but May said that they weren't friends.

May in the Symposium on Alien Contagion
In symposium, May, Hunter and Morse disguised as waiter and entered the delegates' room to find a clue that one of them was Gideon Malick' inside man. May entered Haruto Yakimura's room. She heard as the delegate Ellen King said harsh things on the Inhumans. May tracked a message to King. She decrypted it and the words "MOVE HIM OUT" appeared.

Morse informed him that Hunter had gone after Creel and went to her room. May was informed by Morse that King had an Inhuman for military experiments. As Hunter was threatened in guns by HYDRA operatives, May and Morse knocked them out. Hunter informed her that Talbot's son was there, inside a Suspension Gel. May realized that Malick blackmailed Talbot. Hunter gave them their weapons he had managed to smuggle. May said he hated him less now. She took a motorcycle and drove to find Talbot's son. She found him inside a truck, so she drove to take Coulson, Talbot and Creel.

On Zephyr One, Coulson told May that he suspected Malick answered to someone else. May asked if he was someone more powerful, so he answered that he was someone or something.

Mission in Siberia
Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter managed to follow Gideon Malick to Siberia, with the team follow them on Zephyr One. After a few hours, May, Daisy Johnson and Alphonso Mackenzie landed with a Quinjet to assist Morse and Hunter. Morse informed them that a group of Russian ministers had a meeting with Malick to see an Inhuman. May ordered Johnson, Morse and Mackenzie to find Malick while she would be with Hunter. Hunter and May hided from the soldiers in outside the compound. Hunter discovered a body and May told him that it was the Russian Prime Minister's Attaché. They delivered his biological condition to Jemma Simmons. With the help of Morse, the team learned that Malick planned to use the Inhuman, General Androvich to kill the Prime Minister, as he did with his Attaché.

May hides with Lance Hunter
As Hunter and May were still hiding, he said she could work with Mackenzie, but she replied that she trusted him. Hunter remained her that she said they weren't friends, so she said that friends don't put other people's life in danger for selfish reason, like he did during Attack on Grant Ward. Hunter explained that he would risk his life for everyone at S.H.I.E.L.D. only because they were he cared for them. May said that he was willing to kill Andrew Garner to revenge Grant Ward, something that S.H.I.E.L.D. did not stand for the greater good, and sometimes they had to sacrificed the people you care for that. Hunter said he felt sad for her but also admired her and apologized for everything he had made to her.

The Prime Minister arrived to the compound and Phil Coulson ordered the agents to go to protract him from Androvich. The team converted to the meeting. Mackenzie asked for a distraction, so Hunter said the had an idea that included May hitting people, to which she smiled. With a smoke bomb, Hunter took the Prime Minister and ran while May fought the guards. Morse managed to kill Androvich, but she and Hunter were arrested.

May farewells Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter
Coulson went to free them, but he returned to Zephyr One alone. He informed that the team and they were disavowed from S.H.I.E.L.D. in order to keep it a secret. Later, the team visited a bar where Morse and Hunter were. Without directly contacting them, May and the others all ordered shots for the two, saying goodbye in the only way they could

Tracking Andrew Garner
May tracks Lash down
May encountered Jemma Simmons practicing shooting range and gave her an advice. May asked her why she was doing it, and Simmons said that since she could not defend herself so she had let Lash kill innocent people, she needed to know how to use a gun. May told her that it was not her fault and left. In order to find Garner, May assigned some of S.H.I.E.L.D. services. She asked for Simmons' help, and Simmons told her she used them wrong, since Lash was driven by basic instincts. Simmons asked her what she was planning to do with him, so she answered that she would kill him. Simmons told her about the vaccine for pre-Terrigenesis Inhumans she was working at that could help Lash, but May refused.

Preparing for the Future
May defends herself against HYDRA
While riding in Zephyr One a call came through in which Edwin Abbott desperately called for Daisy Johnson's help. his team went to investigate as Abbott desperately tried to explain that he had seen these events already happening in a vision of his own death given to him by Charles Hinton. An HYDRA QuadCopter suddenly arrived and May shouted that they were HYDRA and pulled her gun at them. They killed Abbott and used the Extraction Claw to kidnap Hinton just as he gave Johnson her own vision.

The team returned to the Playground where Johnson explained her vision, telling that she had seen her fighting to save Hinton from HYDRA. They began discussing how they could try and get ahead of the vision and change the future, but Leo Fitz insisted that it was a fixed point in time which could not be altered no matter what they did. Phil Coulson suggested that they ensure that Johnson would not leave the Playground in order to change the course of the future. Instead, Coulson suggested May would go to save Hinton, since she had not appeared in Johnson's vision.

May found Johnson, Fitz and Jemma Simmons trying to find the building where the fight would accord. Fitz told her that he was using every S.H.I.E.L.D. services for it. May, knowing she had to find Andrew Garner with them, said angrily to Johnson to leave them. Simmons asked her if she believed they could change the future, to which May answered that every move they made changed the future, and the real feat was changing the past.
