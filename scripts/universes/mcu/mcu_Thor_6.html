<html><p>Superhuman Strength:     Thor moving the giant rings of Nidavellir   As an Asgardian, specifically the son of Odin, Thor is the third strongest Asgardian of his time, surpassed only by Odin and Hela, and with their deaths, he is now the strongest Asgardian alive. His incredible high-level of superhuman strength enables him to easily overpower hordes of Humans, Enhanced Humans, Asgardians, Frost Giants, Chitauri, Marauders, Dark Elves, Ultron Sentries, Outriders and various other species within or beyond the Nine Realms. He can lift or move immensely heavy objects effortlessly, such as when he was able to easily catch a falling car with one arm during Battle of Sokovia, saving the family trapped inside it, and flip a large, wide ceremonial table over on Asgard. He can also easily crush extremely durable objects, such as Iron Man's gauntlets. Thor's strength extends to his ability to leap great distances. With his strength, Thor is able to take on multiple enemies at the same time, using Mjølnir to send large groups of enemies, like the Frost Giants, the Chitauri, or Ultron Sentries flying with each strike. Using his weapon Mjølnir, Thor's strength is compounded, as he is able to swing his mighty hammer with great speed and force. Thor's strength is so great, that he can throw his hammer with enough force to break through nearly any barrier. Thor was also strong enough to overpower the Destroyer, which had overwhelmed the likes of Sif and the Warriors Three combined. Notably, he kicked Loki with enough force to shatter glass, lifted his brother off the ground and slammed him with enough force to stun him in their second duel. He also effortlessly overpowered Iron Man in his Mark VI despite it being empowered by Thor's electricity. His strength is so great that strikes with Mjølnir are usually fatal, knocking out opponents with one hit, and only beings of incredible power, like the Destroyer, Hulk, Malekith, Kurse, Ultron, Surtur, Hela, and Thanos can take multiple direct hits from Thor. Hence, Thor was able to shatter a massive Kronan Marauder, take down a Leviathan, and even break the Rainbow Bridge, all with only several blows of his hammer. Thor's immense strength combined with Mjølnir also enabled him to break out of an extremely durable confinement capsule which was specifically designed to hold the Hulk. Using his immense strength, Thor was able to block a crushing blow from Hulk with his own arm and even punch the latter in the face hard enough to make him stagger. Thor also managed to match Malekith, whose strength was greatly compounded by the Aether, equally and eventually overpower him. According to F.R.I.D.A.Y., Thor is able to "crack" the Vibranium core itself with his raw strength alone. He later managed to overpower a weakened Surtur, killing him with a fully-powered hammer blow to the head. During the Contest of Champions, Thor's strength and considerable fighting skill allowed him to dominate against Hulk, capable of staggering Hulk with his punches alone and sending him flying across the arena with a single hammer blow as well as even restraining him, only being overpowered by Hulk's growing anger and surprise attacks. After receiving visions from Odin's spirit, Thor's strength and fighting skill combined with his newfound ability to generate lightning allowed Thor to instantly topple and daze the angered Hulk with a single punch that visibly dazed him. When he fought Hela, although he was ultimately no match for the more powerful Goddess of Death, Thor's physical strength and skill still allowed him to put up a reasonable fight on his own against Hela, who had single-handedly killed the Valkyries, among the most powerful warriors of Asgard, managing to slightly stagger her with his punches and inflict minor injuries and briefly pressure her with Gungnir. Thor was also able to easily rip apart several Berserkers with his bare hands and contend with Hela during their final battle, managing to lift her off her feet and throw her to Valkyrie, fighting her to a prolonged standstill alongside Valkyrie. While attempting to restart the forge, Thor was able to easily swing around Rocket Raccoon's Benatar escape pod at great speeds, and physically holding against the force necessary to move the gigantic rings of Nidavellir, which encircled the neutron star. He also was able to hold open the iris of Nidavellir's star long enough for Eitri to melt ingots of metal that would become Stormbreaker, as well as throw the axe with enough force that, combined with his powers, it was able to slice through a beam from the completed Infinity Gauntlet, and lodge deep into Thanos' chest, as well as cause him great pain upon twisting the axe deeper. During the Battle of Wakanda, Thor overpowered an army of Outriders to save the lives of the Avengers and Wakandan soldiers as well as destroyed several Outriders' armored ships with relative ease. Even while weakened by having became fat, Thor's strength was still immense, as he was capable of grappling with the likes of Thanos for a brief period of time, as Thanos had to use both hands to overpower Thor's attempts to stop him from stabbing him with his own axe and he was able to hold long enough for Captain America to save him and with both Stormbreaker and Mjølnir in his hand when he attempted to decapitate Thanos again, he was gradually able to overpower the one-hand holding Mad Titan, coming very close to succeeding, eventually forcing Thanos to use both his hands and sudden momentum to knock him down. In addition to Thor's high-level strength, a full-power hammer throw aided by Stormbreaker was strong enough to knock out Iron Man in his strongest armor. Only a few beings were able to overpower Thor, including Hela, Surtur at full power, Odin, and Thanos.

Superhuman Durability:     Thor endures the energy of a neutron star   Thor's skin, muscle, and bone tissue have many times the density of the same tissue in the body of a human being, making him nigh-invulnerable, much more so than regular Asgardians to the point that Gamora claimed that Thor's muscles felt as if they were "made of Cotati metal fibers". Even when he was stripped of his powers, Thor was still amazingly resilient due to his dense body, withstanding being hit by a van with ease, and only being seemingly killed by a punch from the Destroyer. When he is at full power and armed with Mjølnir, Thor possesses nigh-invulnerability, including high resistance to powerful energy blasts, immense blunt force trauma, falls from great heights, explosions and various other opposing forces. He was unharmed and unaffected by the vacuum of space for indefinite periods of time unaided. Thor withstood high caliber bullets from the Quinjet that was flown by Ultron, who attempt on killing him during the fight at Sokovia without any injury. He withstood the extreme cold of Jotunheim, the extreme heat of Muspelheim, survived a direct near point-blank range blast from Gungnir blasting him out of Odin's chamber, and falling several hundred feet to the ground, showing no visible signs of injury. Thor easily withstood a four hundred percent-charged repulsor blast from Iron Man, was barely affected and completely uninjured by Quicksilver smashing into him at extreme speeds, took a mighty punch from Hulk with only a minor nosebleed, and even withstood the full force of the Destroyer's energy blasts with no visible injury. During his final battle with Malekith, Thor was even able to survive being hit by quite a few tendrils of the Aether Infinity Stone energy, and later a blast of Surtur's Twilight Sword flames without any permanent damage, though it should be noted that Thor had not been facing off against Surtur while the latter was at full power. Whenever he is injured, Thor's physique allows him to shrug off minor injuries such as small stab wounds from Asgardian blades or allows him to withstand a direct blow in the face from a massive Frost Giant and laugh afterwards. He resisted the direct destruction of the city of Novi Grad followed by a one-kilometer drop in the sea and was only momentarily unconscious. However, his durability would not prevent equally or even stronger foes like Hulk, Kurse, Ultron, weakened Surtur, Hela, or Thanos from wounding him. Nevertheless, Thor's own durability could still allow him to withstand their strength and power for quite some time before he starts to drop in power and be injured, as he withstood a severe beating from Kurse, Ultron, and Hela, notably surviving being stabbed with her Necroswords, which easily killed not only the Einherjar with a single hit but also the Warriors Three and the Valkyries, who had greater durability than low-tier Asgardian warriors, with no permanent damage, and managed to continue fighting afterwards, overpowered Surtur despite Surtur being at least equal, if not superior, to Thor in power, withstood a repeated tossing to the ground from Hulk during the Contest of Champions with no damage whereas Loki, despite his own extreme resilience, was completely wiped out from such an attack, and he was able to remain conscious upon being overpowered and pummelled by the angered Hulk long enough for him to experience a vision from Odin and turn the tides while sustaining no injury. After getting his full powers, Thor's durability grew much greater, with him thus shrugging off Hela's attacks and continuing to fight her with no deterioration in his performance and even managing to remain conscious after having been badly beaten by Thanos to an even greater degree than Hulk was, which still soundly knocked out the gamma beast, and even survived having his head squeezed by Thanos, whereas Loki was quickly killed by Thanos with less effort, once again proving he is significantly more durable and resilient than Loki, and soon be exposed to the vacuum of space, although all this combined caused him to pass out. Thor was also capable of surviving the full force of a re-ignited Nidavellir star for several minutes, though it left his body severely charred and rendered him unconscious, leaving him near-death. Thor's physical constitution is so strong he is able to survive exposure to the power of the Infinity Stones, as evidenced when he was able to quickly recover from being hit by the Reality Stone's powers whenever Malekith blasts it at him. He was also able to remain conscious after repeatedly being pressed by the force of the Power Stone against his head, however, at a less degree of the stone's full power whereas beings less powerful were instantly obliterate by the Stone, although he nevertheless suffered excruciating pain every time Thanos pressed it against him and prolonged exposure would likely eventually kill him, as Loki quickly submitted to Thanos' demands when he saw Thor being tortured by the Power Stone. Even while hampered by his poor lifestyle and subsequent weight gain, he was still far more durable than most of the other Avengers, as he was able to withstand getting pummeled by the 2014 Thanos' strongest attacks while remaining conscious, as well as enduring Thanos using Stormbreaker to nearly gut open his chest long enough for Captain America to save him with only minor bruises and bleeding scars.
Thor endures the energy of a neutron star
Superhuman Speed: Thor can move at great superhuman speeds. Thor tackled Hulk through the wall of a Helicarrier in a split second, visibly appearing as a blur when they were battling in the hangar bay. He also proves capable of overwhelming Hulk in hand-to-hand combat during their second fight, able to easily dodge his feral attacks and land his own blows and get a grip on him. In battle, while holding back, he is easily fast enough to contend with the extremely fast Loki in combat and although his adopted brother is capable of outmaneuvring him when he is holding back, when Thor unleashed his rage, he was able to easily catch Loki off-guard, disarm him of his scepter and then brutally attack him without Loki being able to react in their second duel, implying that his speed exceeds Loki's. Moreover, Thor was so fast that he was still moving in Quicksilver's accelerated perception, while Captain America and Iron Man appeared as frozen in comparison. He could also contend with Hela, who had easily killed several Einherjar before they could react, for a time, able to briefly push her back when giving it all he got and land blows and react to her attacks after she recovered before being ultimately outpaced, and after unlocking his full powers, he was able to stay in combat with Hela to an even greater degree, showing no strain in moving fast enough to land glancing blows on her and even to surprise and lift her off the ground. Although he was easily kicked away soon after, Thor was able to surprise and land a hit on Thanos before he could kill Hulk. Even with his fat body diminishing his speed, he was still stupendously fast, as he was able to surprise the Mad Titan twice, first when he had just knocked down Captain America, catching him off-guard enough to disarm him and then in their last altercation when he was in a haste to retrieve the Infinity Gauntlet to briefly outmaneuver him enough to land a blow with his hammer and slash off his armor with his axe.
Superhuman Agility: Thor's agility, dexterity, balance, and bodily coordination make him a great warrior for battle. He moves with incredible grace and speed despite his considerable size and body density. He was able to dodge the wing of a jet fighter thrown at him by Hulk, as well as dodging many of Hulk's hammer and battle-ax blows and outmanoeuvring him in their second battle. He can easily keep up with Loki while holding back despite Loki's great agility in both their fights. While his five years of constant drinking and becoming fat did hamper his agility, he was still extremely agile, as he was able to dodge Thanos' sword when it was thrown at him and seamlessly attack Thanos enough to disarm him and quickly landed hits on Thanos immediately upon landing down to intercept him when he was off-guard in their last altercation.
Superhuman Stamina: Thor's advanced musculature is considerably more efficient than that of a human and most other Asgardians. As a result, his muscles produce far fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity compared to those of humans and most other members of his race. He was able to endure the vacuum of space while unconscious.
Superhuman Reflexes: Thor can react and dodge objects traveling at high speeds, with him dodging many of Hulk's blows during the Contest of Champions and he was able to blast away swords thrown by Hela as soon as they were sent flying towards him. He was also able to dodge intense Odinforce beams from the Destroyer and deflect them with his hammer. Thor was also capable of reacting to energy blasts from Loki's Scepter during their battle on Avengers Tower and energy blasts from Chitauri Guns, using his hammer to deflect them.
Regenerative Healing Factor: Despite his astounding resistance to injury, it is still possible to injure Thor. However, due to his Asgardian physiology, Thor is able to heal at a rate significantly faster than a normal human and even much faster than most Asgardians. After seemingly being killed by the Destroyer and proving himself worthy of Mjølnir once again, Thor regained his full power and immediately healed himself in seconds. Despite receiving mild to severe stab wounds from Asgardian blades on several occasions, after working past the initial pain of the injury, Thor was able to quickly recover and continue fighting. After the brutal beating he suffered from Kurse, upon arriving at Earth several minutes later, he had nearly completely recovered from his bleeding wounds. While fighting Hela, Thor was painfully pierced multiple times by her Necroswords, getting his right eye gouged out in the process, and while Thor was unable to regenerate his eye, he recovered from all of the stabs mere minutes later, despite the Warriors Three all perishing from a single stab from Hela each. After suffering a beating from Thanos and getting burned by the Power Stone, Thor managed to recover rapidly afterwards. Later, Thor survived the full force of a re-ignited Nidavellir star, though it left his body charred and near death, Thor was completely healed after receiving Stormbreaker to harness and amplify his supernatural powers.
Longevity: Thor, like all other Asgardians, is not truly immortal. It is possible to kill an Asgardian and other beings in the Nine Realms. More accurately, Asgardians are extremely long-lived beings. Thor ages at a pace far slower than a normal human. During his conversation with Rocket Raccoon, he claimed to be 1,500 years old.
Thor's entire body is charged by electricity
Elemental Manipulation: Though Thor's Asgardian physiology far exceeds the abilities of a normal athletic human, when he was stripped of his power and found unworthy of Mjølnir, his god-like abilities were diminished so much that he was able to be tasered into unconsciousness. It was only when he was found worthy of wielding Mjølnir did Thor recover his god-like physiology and therefore could go toe-to-toe with extremely powerful beings like the Destroyer. Thus, the hammer enhances a person's physiology to that of Thor, the "God of Thunder". It was later revealed Mjølnir was never the source of Thor's power, but a tool to help him focus his power until he was able to master and wield his powers freely, which he would finally do after Odin made him understood that the powers he channeled through his hammer were his own. As a result, Thor is now able to utilize his innate supernatural abilities without Mjølnir's aid. These abilities include:
Weather Manipulation: Thor was born with the power to control weather storms, with it being the reason he is called the "God of Thunder". Even before Thor unlocked his powers, he still displayed a level of control over the weather, able to manipulate parts of it, although his focus always seemed to be somewhere else so whenever events of him displaying this power occurred his mind was elsewhere. Among them was when he was able to keep rain from touching Jane Foster as a downpour occurred as well as when he began to generate sparks of lightning from his hands after becoming furious. He began to unlock the full potential of his abilities during his encounter with Hela and is now able to generate rather large storm clouds and create thunder.
Electricity Manipulation:     Thor projecting lightning from his weapons   Thor was born with the ability to generate, control and project electrical energy, with him thus being dubbed the "God of Thunder". Even while unable to personally harness it and needing Mjølnir to focus his powers over electricity, Thor's electric bolts were already strong enough that it was able to blacken an Aether-enhanced Malekith, take down two Chitauri Leviathans and a large amount of the aliens, and his electrical powers was already potent enough that Thor could generate incredible enough levels of electricity as to help Iron Man swiftly smite the falling Sokovia City to oblivion. Following Odin's death and visions from his father's spirit, Thor finally fully unlocked his electrical powers and his powers over lightning are enhanced to the point where he could generate incredible amounts of electrical energy from his own body and summon thunder and lightning from the sky, all without the use of Mjølnir. His new ability allows him to seamlessly integrate lightning into his fighting sequences against Hulk in the Contest of Champions, and then later against Hela and her undead army. He becomes able to use lightning to pull and hurl enemies, blast projectiles to pieces, and infuse his weapons with electricity. Thor's generated lightning bolts grew so powerful that he was able to easily send an enraged Hulk flying back and visibly stun him for a time and even temporarily stun and knock down Hela herself with a single respective blast. Thor was even able to cast a lightning bolt powerful enough to destroy a portion of the Rainbow Bridge that Hela was standing on to ultimately send her crashing down into the water beneath. Wielding Stormbreaker, Thor's powers over electricity grew greatly to the point that he was able to generate a lightning blast powerful enough to knock Thanos back a considerable distance and using all his power, was able to charge the Stormbreaker so powerfully that he was able to throw it with enough power to quickly slice through a beam fired from the completed Infinity Gauntlet, although Thanos was off-guard and did not use the Infinity Gauntlet to its full power, and grievously injure Thanos in a single strike, with Thanos himself saying that Thor may have been able to kill him had he aimed for the head.
Flight:     Thor flying over the battlefield in Wakanda   One of Thor's new abilities that he discovered after losing Mjølnir was how he was able to hover, glide, and fly through the air at great speeds without any outside help. He was able to grab onto Hulk and lift him several feet in the air while they were fighting in the Contest of Champions. He also was able to hover across the Rainbow Bridge multiple times during his final encounter with his sister Hela. He was able to launch himself into the air from the Royal Palace to the middle of the Bifrost within moments. During the Battle of Wakanda, Thor flew easily while using Stormbreaker to destroy the ships of the Outriders and later while attacking Thanos.
Weather Manipulation: Thor was born with the power to control weather storms, with it being the reason he is called the "God of Thunder". Even before Thor unlocked his powers, he still displayed a level of control over the weather, able to manipulate parts of it, although his focus always seemed to be somewhere else so whenever events of him displaying this power occurred his mind was elsewhere.

He began to unlock the full potential of his abilities during his encounter with Hela and is now able to generate rather large storm clouds and create thunder.

Powers via Stormbreaker: After acquiring a new weapon to replace Mjølnir, Thor gained additional powers through its use.
Bifrost Summoning: After Thor gained his new devastating weapon, Stormbreaker, he was able to teleport at will, due to gaining the ability to manipulate the Bifrost Bridge. As a result, Thor instantly teleported himself, Rocket Raccoon and Groot to Wakanda, in order to aid his allies in the battle against Thanos and the Black Order.
Weapon Summoning: After Thor received his new axe, Stormbreaker, he gained the ability to summon it similar to Mjølnir.
Bifrost Summoning: After Thor gained his new devastating weapon, Stormbreaker, he was able to teleport at will, due to gaining the ability to manipulate the Bifrost Bridge.

Weapon Summoning: After Thor received his new axe, Stormbreaker, he gained the ability to summon it similar to Mjølnir.
Former Powers
Powers via Mjølnir: Due to the enchantments placed upon the mystical hammer, Thor was granted the ability to focus his innate mystical abilities and harness them. It allowed him to easily harness his dominion over weather elements and that allowed for several other sub-abilities to follow suit. Along with the discovery of his powers originating from himself instead of his weapon, Thor retained the abilities he had with and without Mjølnir once he obtained Stormbreaker, which also amplified them to a degree.
Weather Manipulation: Wielding Mjølnir's helped refine Thor's power to give him the ability to control the base elements of a storm. It could control the elements and create giant raging electrical storms complete with thunder, lightning, hurricane-force winds, tornadoes, tidal waves, earthquakes, and torrential rains all on a moment's notice. With Mjølnir's help, Thor was able to summon an isolated class 5 tornado while battling the Destroyer as well as a lightning bolt strong enough to destroy a large piece of landscape in Jotunheim. The Norse myths and legends regarded him as the God of Thunder because of the hammer's influence over the weather. After discovering that Mjølnir was only used to focus his power and was never the source of it, Thor was able to summon thunder and lightning from the sky as well as from his own body. With the use of Stormbreaker, the abilities Thor had with his hammer are restored and greater enhanced.
Electricity Manipulation: Thor's main weapon while using Mjølnir is the ability to summon a lightning bolt from the surrounding skyline. As well as being able to channel electricity on its own Mjølnir is able to attract the ambient electricity from the surrounding atmosphere and redirect it towards a given target, such as when he summoned electricity from inside of Avengers Tower and used it to bring Vision to life. While on Jotunheim, Thor summoned a huge lightning bolt, strong enough to destroy a large portion of the landscape. During the Battle of New York, Thor used the spire of the Chrysler building to channel a tremendous lightning bolt, which he directed at the portal of the Chitauri to deter a portion of the enemy reinforcements, managing to bring down two massive Leviathan and numerous Chitauri aliens with the blast. During the Battle of Sokovia, Thor was able to generate an incredible amount of lighting, helping Iron Man swiftly smite the hovering Sokovian capital city into oblivion, thwarting Ultron's plans in the process. After his visions of Odin and discovering Mjølnir was not the source of his powers, he became capable of summoning thunder and lightning without it and even generating electrical energy from his own body. Thor's power over electrical energy was greatly enhanced by his use of Stormbreaker, which restored and improved upon the abilities he possessed with Mjølnir.
Energy Projection: With Mjølnir, Thor could project blasts, waves, and bolts of electrical energy of various sizes and intensities. While the hammer can generate electrical energy, it can channel more energy from the lightning storms it creates to summon its lightning for powerful energy attacks. With Mjølnir, Odin could project a powerful beam of golden light and use it to take away all of Thor's superhuman powers, destroy what was left of Thor's armor after stripping much of it off of him, and ultimately send him flying into the Bifrost.
Weight Manipulation: Mjølnir's enchantment allows its worthy wielders to swing it nearly effortlessly yet, in reality, it is extremely heavy to an average person. Its ability to manipulate its weight allows Thor to hurl Mjølnir at great speeds or alternatively by holding onto the leather thong and whirling it like a flail, use the hammer as a thrashing vortex. In Jotunheim, he bashes the Frost Giants around him, then throws Mjølnir, making it hit multiple Frost Giants in its path in moments. Quicksilver, Loki and Hulk were pinned down by Mjølnir's immense weight, though also due to them being unworthy to wield it.
Flight: Thor was capable of spinning Mjølnir with great force, at such high speeds that it seems like a blur to the naked eye, and by holding onto the leather thong, was capable of flying through the air at immense speeds. How fast exactly was not specified, but he was able to remain aloft in the middle of a Class 5 tornado, and traverse the distance from his father's chambers to Himinbjorg and back again in seconds. Using Mjølnir, Thor could also move across the New Mexico desert in a matter of seconds. While flying, Thor can use his speed to strike enemies with immense force, such as when he tackled Hulk through a wall, tackled Malekith in and out of portals, and when Thor killed a Frost Beast on Jotunheim by flying through its skull.
Weapon Summoning: Mjølnir obeyed Thor's summons as though it was driven by a form of intelligence. Mjølnir went to Thor when it was in a crater miles away, arriving in seconds. Mjølnir would return to Thor whenever he threw it at an opponent. While battling Hulk in a hanger of the Helicarrier, Thor summoned Mjølnir from another room and it came crashing through the Helicarrier to get to him. Thor's newest weapon, Stormbreaker, retains Mjølnir's ability to be summoned and telekinetically controlled by the user.
Armor Generation:     Thor summons his armor   By summoning lightning from the sky into Mjølnir, Thor's clothes are transformed into his combat armor. The hammer was also able to transform Thor's clothing into those worn by humans, while it could appear as an umbrella. With the use of Stormbreaker, Thor is able to transform his clothing into his combat armor once more.
Resurrection: Mjølnir possessed the ability to revive people back from death itself and to restore them to optimum health like when it resurrected Thor as he was passing away due to being injured by the Destroyer while he was mortal. This ability was passed over to Thor's replacement for Mjølnir, Stormbreaker, which allowed him to fully recover from nearly fatal injuries.

With the use of Stormbreaker, Thor is able to transform his clothing into his combat armor once more.

Resurrection: Mjølnir possessed the ability to revive people back from death itself and to restore them to optimum health like when it resurrected Thor as he was passing away due to being injured by the Destroyer while he was mortal. This ability was passed over to Thor's replacement for Mjølnir, Stormbreaker, which allowed him to fully recover from nearly fatal injuries.

Thor fighting against HYDRA
Master Combatant: Thor is the greatest and most powerful warrior in Asgard since Odin and Hela have currently been deceased. He is one of the most skilled fighters in the Nine Realms, as he has been trained in the arts of war and various Asgardian fighting techniques. He is therefore extremely masterful in many areas of combat and with over centuries of combat experience, including hand-to-hand combat and various forms of weaponry available in Asgard, primarily swords and spears, though he usually prefers to wield his hammer Mjølnir. Thor is known to be very cunning and intuitive in battles and in warfare, having fought and defeated many enemies throughout his life. Even when rendered mortal and stripped of his strength and powers, Thor utilized his sheer vast fighting skills to overpower nearly a dozen highly skilled S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives in hand-to-hand combat, as the very impressed Phil Coulson stated that Thor made some of the most highly trained professionals in the world "look like a bunch of minimum wage mall cops." At full power, Thor has fought and defeated over a hundred Marauder warriors in Vanaheim, beaten several armed Asgardian soldiers without needing to use his hammer with ease, battled hordes of Frost Giants with great ease in Jotunheim, as well as numerous hordes of Chitauri aliens in the Battle of New York. During the Battle of Sokovia, Thor fought and destroyed many Ultron Sentries effortlessly, prompting an irritated Ultron to tackle him away and deal with Thor personally. Thor was also able to overpower the extremely formidable Destroyer, which even the combined might of Lady Sif and the Warriors Three failed to do, maneuver around the larger Hulk and strike the latter with ease, and could easily handle Loki in both of their altercations while holding back to not kill him, not only always gaining the upper hand over his brother despite Loki putting up a considerable fight but upon being engaged in their second fight, he was able to swiftly overtake Loki without needing his hammer and defeat him when he had the Scepter. Thor even went toe-to-toe with the extremely skilled and experienced Aether-enhanced Malekith, and ultimately defeated the latter after a prolonged battle. Thor also easily defeated hordes of Surtur's Muspelheim warriors, took down a weakened version of Surtur himself and dominated the equally strong Hulk in the Contest of Champions, despite Hulk's skill having grown so much he was undefeatable in the contest, displaying a substantially superior fighting level, as Hulk only managed to hit Thor when he was surprised and off-guard while Thor was easily able to counter most of Hulk's blows both in armed and hand-to-hand combat and land several blows and with his full powers, he swiftly outmatched Hulk, with only Grandmaster's interference keeping Thor from winning. Thor was even capable of standing up the far more powerful and experienced Hela in their second fight, who had single-handedly massacred the top-elite Asgardian warrior Valkyries and all the Einherjar, able to briefly outmaneuver her even unarmed while she had her Necrosword before ultimately being overpowered and having his right eye gouged out. Upon gaining his full powers, Thor was able to effortlessly defeat all of Hela's undead troops with his bare hands and with aid from Valkyrie was able to fight Hela to a prolonged standstill. Thor also survived his first battle with Thanos and despite having been easily defeated and badly pummeled, managed to surprise and land a hit on him before getting easily kicked away. After acquiring Stormbreaker and regaining his armor, Thor effortlessly killed many Outriders and destroyed their ships and, by focusing all of his power into a single blow, was the only hero able to surprise and severely injure Thanos. When battling the 2014 Thanos, Thor, despite having not fought for 5 years and gotten out of shape, proved to remain an extremely formidable fighter, as not only could he easily take down multiple Outriders, but he even fought the hardest against the Mad Titan out of himself, Captain America and Iron Man, managing to disarm Thanos of his sword and come considerably close to killing him with some aid from Rogers.

Hammer Mastery: Thor is exceptionally proficient in using his war hammer Mjølnir, due to centuries of practice wielding it, and he is also extremely proficient in hammer throwing. He even had been able to use Mjølnir as a powerful defense tool, blocking energy shots from the Destroyer, Loki's Scepter, Chitauri weaponry, Malekith's Aether, and even Surtur's Twilight Sword (though Surtur was notably not at full power then). His overall skill in using Mjølnir in combat had allowed him to best Loki twice using the equally powerful Scepter and Gungnir despite later admitting he was holding back, stalemate the Aether-enhanced Malekith, kill Surtur, effortlessly defeat multiple enemies be it Frost Giants, Ultron's sentries or Surtur's warriors. Thor's hammer fighting skills are also highly adaptable, as displayed when he used a far bulkier Sakaaran hammer to battle Hulk in the Contest of Champions due to his hammer having been destroyed and was able to dominate Hulk and break his axe, although Hulk managed to use his growing rage to catch a blow from Thor using said hammer and then surprise and disarm him. Not using his hammer for several years did little to hamper Thor's skill in hammer combat, as he was quickly able to dual-wield Mjølnir along with Stormbreaker effectively against Thanos and Outriders, with Thanos being forced to use Iron Man to shield himself when Thor threw the hammer at him and easily killing many Outriders when he switched weapons. He was also readily able to use Doug's mace in conjunction with a shield in his duel against Hulk, but did not get a proper chance to use them and instead had to resort to using a knife and swords.
Sword Mastery: Thor is highly accomplished in swordsmanship, with him choosing a pair of blades out of all available weapons for the Contest of Champions, and managing to block several strikes from Hulk with them, though the swords broke in the process. Thor later used another pair of blades against Hela in their second battle and was able to momentarily hold his own against her, though Thor was quickly disarmed. Thor would later duel much better against Hela using two blades in their final fight when he had unlocked his full powers, managing to land glancing hits on the Goddess of Death and easily destroy her Necroswords.
Spear Mastery: Thor is extremely skilled at fighting with a spear, as he notably wielded Gungnir in his second battle against Hela, and was briefly able to push her back, disarming her of her Necrosword and scoring several hits and countering some of her attacks, before ultimately getting disarmed.

Axe Mastery: Thor is immensely skilled in fighting with an axe, able to wield his newly forged Stormbreaker with ease against several Outriders, single-handedly taking down an entire ship of Outriders and even able to severely injure Thanos with a single throw. He also was able to stand his ground against the 2014 Thanos using his sword, even able to disarm him and slice him when he was unarmed, along with later on cutting his armor when he was off-guard. While using Stormbreaker, Thor expertly transitions between using the hammer section and the axe portion in battle, using the former to land vicious blows channeled by his own electricity to target multiple Outriders and using the edges of the axe to mortally wound and later decapitate the Mad Titan himself.
Expert Marksman: Thor is a skilled marksman, he was able to gun down several Sakaaran Guards with a Sakaaran Laser Rifle with little effort during the Escape from Sakaar. However, his marksmanship is best shown in throwing his hammer or axe. He is able to throw them with extreme accuracy, hitting his target every time.
Master Tactician: Thor is an excellent strategist due to centuries of combat training and experience. He has lead his allies into many battles for centuries, including Sif and the Warriors Three, with great leadership and the employment of strategies and tactics adapted from various civilizations across the Nine Realms. In order to save Jotunheim, Thor realized he had to destroy the Rainbow Bridge even though it meant he might never see Jane Foster again. During the Battle of Vanaheim, Thor ended the battle early just moments after arriving by defeating the biggest Marauder. During the Second Dark Elf Conflict, Thor successfully orchestrated Jane Foster's escape from Asgard, a feat which impressed Loki, and nearly succeeded in destroying the Aether had it not been for its indestructibility. After he received a vision by Scarlet Witch during the Battle at the Salvage Yard, Thor went to the Water of Sights to unlock the secrets of the hallucinations created by Scarlet Witch during the Battle at the Salvage Yard. This decision led to Thor helping create Vision which in turn helped stop the threat of Ultron. Thor realized Loki had replaced Odin and was masquerading as him something other Asgardians had failed to notice. After being trapped on Sakaar, Thor managed to orchestrate an escape from the planet and freed several prisoners at the same time. After realizing he couldn't defeat Hela himself, Thor had Loki resurrect Surtur in order to destroy her. This plan worked and all Asgardians were evacuated before Asgard's destruction. After being defeated by Thanos, Thor realized he needed a new weapon to fight him and went to Nidavellir to make a weapon capable of killing Thanos. This decision proved fruitful as it led to the creation of Stormbreaker. Thor used Stormbreaker to turn the tide during the Battle of Wakanda and eventually killed Thanos with it. During the Theft of the Reality Stone, Thor decided to take the past version of Mjølnir to the future with him for use in future battles. This decision proved fruitful as Captain America proved worthy of wielding it and used it to save Thor from being killed by the past version of Thanos. Thor is also a brilliant combat strategist as he has used Mjølnir's worthiness enchantment to immobilize enemies such as Loki and the Fire Dragon.
Pilot: Thor has demonstrated a level of proficiency and knowledge in piloting various types of alien spacecrafts, able to effectively pilot a Dark Elf Harrow and Grandmaster's ship, the Commodore, while also displaying some understanding of Star-Lord's ship, the Benatar.
Multilingualism: Thor speaks Asgardian, English and he can understand Groot.
