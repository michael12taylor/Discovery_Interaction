<html><p>This clash was once again taken away by Daredevil, who blocked everything that Poindexter threw at him before fighting him one on one, while Fisk wrapped Marianna in his coat and attempted to use the distraction to take her away to safety. However, Poindexter soon managed to subdue Daredevil while throwing him through a window before picking up shards of broken glass and throwing them at Fisk who, now without his protective jacket, was impaled by the shards, causing him considerable pain. While Fisk ripped the shards out of his skin, Daredevil had continued holding Poindexter back.

Fisk furiously defeats Benjamin Poindexter
Despite Daredevil soon regaining the upper hand over Poindexter as he had beat him down, Poindexter had spotted an opportunity to kill Marianna, as he grabbed a steel bowl and threw it with considerable force at her head, only for Daredevil to leap up at the last moment and block it from hitting Marianna. Fisk, enraged by all Poindexter's continued attempts to murder his wife, charged at Poindexter and managed to pick him up off the ground, before smashing Poindexter into a brick wall at full force, which had resulted in Poindexter's spine being crushed and leaving him lying paralyzed on the floor.

Fisk ready to fight back against Daredevil
Now with Poindexter out of their fight, Fisk turned his attention back to Daredevil and, despite being wounded by Poindexter's last attack, Fisk continued attempting to beat Daredevil to death. However, it soon became apparent that, no matter how much strength and rage Fisk still had, Daredevil remained the superior fighter and still had more energy than Fisk, as Daredevil managed to land several strong hits against Fisk, beating him down until Fisk then managed to land a head butt that knocked Daredevil back for a brief moment, while Fisk then locked eyes with Marianna who had continued watching.

Fisk stops to look back at Vanessa Marianna
Distracted by looking at his beloved wife, Fisk lowered his arms and allowed Daredevil to continue beating him, as Fisk was beaten down onto his knees and repeatedly struck in the face, as Fisk's blood had stained Rabbit in a Snowstorm as Fisk was finally beaten down into submission. As Marianna screamed in horror, Daredevil considered snapping Fisk's neck, only to stop himself and roar in rage, while Fisk still told Daredevil that he would continue hunting Karen Page as well as Foggy Nelson and he would expose Daredevil's true identity to the world and demanding that Daredevil kill him once and for all.

Fisk getting talked down upon by Daredevil
Knowing that his death would destroy Daredevil's soul forever, Fisk noted that no prison like Ryker's Island would be able to hold him in and continued to demand that Daredevil kill him. Daredevil, however, refused to allow Fisk to destroy who he was, furiously vowing that Fisk would spend the rest of his life in his cage, being kept far away from Marianna and knowing that New York City had rejected him and that Daredevil had beaten him. Daredevil had then lifted up his mask, revealing Matt Murdock underneath, while demanding that Fisk keep his secret and never attempt to assassinate Page or Nelson.

Fisk is forced to accept Daredevil's offer
Daredevil had then threatened that if he did not agree, then he would prove that Marianna ordered the death of Ray Nadeem. Looking at Marianna, Fisk confessed that he had failed her and admitted that this had been the happiest day of his life, as she told him that all she ever wanted was him. With that, Fisk agreed to Daredevil's terms in order to keep Marianna safe. Having shaken hands, Fisk watched as Daredevil left before Brett Mahoney and his team arrived to arrest Fisk and Marianna, taking the paralyzed Poindexter into custody as Mahoney acknowledged Poindexter was not the real Daredevil.

Kingpin being taken away by Brett Mahoney
Having finally been defeated, Fisk was taken outside in handcuffs by Mahoney, along with several FBI agents who had also been exposed by Nadeem's video, including Tammy Hattley. While Fisk was being moved to Mahoney's police car to be taken back to prison, he asked Mahoney to have one final chance to say goodbye to Marianna, who was being put into a separate police car; however, Mahoney refused as he noted how Fisk had not done the same for all the men who he murdered. As Marianna was taken away from him, Fisk roared out in frustration before being taken into police custody once again.

Personality
Despite being one of New York City's most powerful crime lords, Fisk has a very shy and introverted demeanor. He did not like crowds and was uncomfortable around other people, until Vanessa Marianna's involvement. Fisk almost had an compulsive mindset, being a creature of habit and hating when things in his life changed, or went against how they were planned. It could be argued that Fisk exhibits symptoms of autism, due to these reasons.

However, in spite of his social anxiety and his awkward nature, he is nonetheless capable of being extremely persuasive and charismatic when he needs to be. He has a keen understanding of psychology and social dynamics, which allows him to almost effortlessly manipulate people around him and exploit their psychological and emotional weaknesses. He also has a natural talent for leadership, as his take-charge attitude, the sheer force of personality, and raw physical presence enable him to take control of chaotic situations. As evidenced from the speeches he gave at his press conferences, he knows how to play a crowd as well, feigning emotion and passion in order to rally support from the masses.

He is a polite, articulate, and well-spoken man of courtesy and manners. He expected courtesy from his subordinates as well, as he would attack and sometimes even kill those who did not show respect to him or those he cares about. Fisk is a man of deep sophistication, enjoying the high-class life despite his poor origins. He enjoyed fine suits, fine dining, and classic literature and music. He considered himself a man of honor and always kept his word. While he can be a brutal, cold, calculating machine, he honestly believed what he was doing for Hell's Kitchen was righteous.

However, if Fisk was provoked he had an unstoppable, almost animal-like rage. His aggression was immense, and nothing could get in his way if those he cared about or his plan for the city were in danger. This was largely due to his abusive father, who taught him to keep hitting someone even when they were bloodied and beaten. Fisk's broken childhood had a lasting effect on him, still causing him nightmares even into his later years. He even hallucinated his reflection in the mirror having the image of his younger self covered in blood after murdering his father.

There are only four people that Fisk has ever cared for in his life. Fisk's mother was the only person that showed him love and respect growing up, and thus Fisk would kill to protect her, killing both Ben Urich and his own father for her. Vanessa Marianna became the love of his life; Wilson once brutally beat Anatoly Ranskahov to death and removed his head with a car door for simply interrupting their date. When Leland Owlsley had been involved in poisoning Marianna, he threw him down an elevator shaft to his death. James Wesley was the only man Fisk ever called a friend; he was emotionally distraught upon learning the death of Wesley, even kissing the forehead of his dead friend, and ordered the assassination of Karen Page when he found out she was the one who had killed him. Finally, Fisk had a deep respect and almost fear of Madame Gao, and her opinion of him, though this changed after he found out that she was responsible for the attempt on Marianna's life.

Marianna's effect on him made him more vulnerable and less able to run his organization because his focus was primarily on her. He ignored both Gao's and Owlsley's warnings to cut ties to her and as such, Owlsley betrayed him by dealing with Gao and was part of the plot to poison Marianna. Fisk was shocked at his friend's betrayal and it took time for him to come to his senses and kill Owlsley. When his criminal organization was brought down and his plans for the city ruined, he finally snapped and no longer cared about the city, saying it deserved to be destroyed and it deserved people like his father. His belief was shown when he related himself to the antagonist of the Good Samaritan story, as he first thought himself to be the hero of it.

After being imprisoned, Fisk became even more cynical, ruthless, violent, and sociopathic. Having given up on his ambitions to change the city for the better, he became concerned solely with attaining money and power, getting revenge upon the people who had wronged him, and being reunited with Marianna. He also became more impulsive and prone to homicidal outbursts, as he beat Wellers to death in a fit of rage after Benjamin Poindexter failed to kill Page. While he originally showed some reluctance and remorse about killing civilians like Elena Cardenas, this changed after his release from prison, as he displayed a willingness to order the murders of innocent people without a second thought if it would even slightly further his plans. This was evidenced when he had Poindexter go on a killing spree at the New York Bulletin in order to cause a panic, and when he had Julie Barnes murdered to secure Poindexter's loyalty even though it was not necessary.

Despite losing most of his moral compass, Fisk still does have some level of compassion and loyalty in regards to Marianna. When Felix Manning failed a task Fisk not only spared him but allowed him to still work for him in gratitude for keeping Marianna safe. He also kept his word not to expose Daredevil or go after Foggy Nelson or Page when Daredevil threatened to expose Marianna to the police as being the one who had ordered the hit on Ray Nadeem.

Abilities
Gifted Intellect: To be added
Master Tactician: Fisk is an excellent manipulator. He has managed to cause a fair deal of the criminal activity of Hell's Kitchen for years without revealing his identity to the public. Even when he revealed himself, he fooled the public into supporting him and viewing Daredevil as a terrorist. Whilst in Ryker's Island, Fisk was able to maneuver himself from being a first-time inmate to being almost in control of the whole prison within a mere matter of months by eliminating his competition. Hence, Fisk was even able to persuade Frank Castle (an accomplished strategist himself) to kill Dutton for him, despite the fact that the Punisher usually went out of his way to avoid making deals with criminals. Upon their first meeting, Fisk was able to sense that Benjamin Poindexter was not entirely mentally fit, and began to slowly manipulate him into working for him as an assassin.
Master Businessman: Fisk at first only controlled the crime of the Hell's Kitchen, but has come to hire half of the underworld from New York City, be it criminal organizations like the Hand, individual criminals like Turk Barrett or even part of the FBI, all to keep himself safe. He came to found his own shell companies, like Union Allied Construction, Confederated Global Investments, Vancorp, and Red Lion National Bank for his illegal activity.
Fisk completely overpowering Daredevil
Expert Combatant: Fisk, despite having no formal combat training, is a very formidable opponent due to his size and pure muscle, with his immense brute strength allowing Fisk to lift a grown man into the air with a single arm, to beat men to death with only a few hits, to bench press an extreme amount of weight on a prison barbell, to punch through brick, and to toss Daredevil around a small alley. Hence, Fisk was able to fight the highly trained Daredevil almost to a standstill in their second duel. Fisk also used his great strength to knock down and overpower Frank Castle, though it should be noted that the latter was limited at the time by having his hands and legs cuffed together, as well as him still not having yet fully recovered from the numerous wounds from a prison fight. Fisk was able to hold his own against both Daredevil and Benjamin Poindexter at once for a prolonged period of time, and even though both of them were more skilled combatants, he eventually overpowered Poindexter and broke his back.
Multilingualism: Fisk is fluent in English, Mandarin, and Japanese.
Equipment
Weapons
Hammer: Upon witnessing his father brutally beating his mother, Fisk chose to grab a hammer and struck his father across the head. Fisk then proceeded to beat his father in the head with the hammer until he was dead, which had then forced Fisk's mother to cover up the bloody murder.
Jimenez Arms JA32: During his second date with Vanessa Marianna, Fisk commented on the gun she had brought with her, as she handed it over to Fisk, who had then placed inside his jacket pocket.
Metal Rebar: Fisk had used this piece of metal rebar as his blunt melee weapon during his second fight against Daredevil, though he was eventually disarmed of it.
Billy Club: Fisk temporarily used Daredevil's own billy club against him during their second fight, brutally beating him while Daredevil was on the ground, though Daredevil's armour protected him from the blows and he was eventually able to take it back from Fisk.
Other Equipment
Body Armor: Fisk wore a protective suit designed by Melvin Potter which was made of a durable material that was able to withstand being cut and stabbed as shown in his first fight against Daredevil and Anatoly Ranskahov. As it gave Fisk protection, the armor was also light and flexible as clothing, allowing it to be worn underneath to fool any opponent.
Fisk closely studying Rabbit in a Snowstorm
Rabbit in a Snowstorm: When he visited the Scene Contempo Gallery, Fisk had been convinced to buy the all-white painting by Vanessa Marianna. Hanging the painting above his bed, Fisk found it reminded him of the day when he had murdered his own father, having starred at the blank wall before the murder took place, giving him a feeling of being alone. When Fisk was arrested and sent into Ryker's Island, the painting was returned into Esther Falb, whose family originally owned it, although Fisk was determined to get it back. Once he was freed, Benjamin Donovan had failed to negotiate for the painting, and Fisk finally agreed to allow Falb to keep it. However, the painting was recovered by Benjamin Poindexter, who killed Falb to get it, although it was later ruined when Daredevil was brutally beating down Fisk, causing much of Fisk's blood to stain the canvas.
Ankle Monitor: Following his release from Ryker's Island, Fisk was fitted with an Ankle Monitor by the FBI, so they could keep track of his location while he was being held at the Presidential Hotel. However, as Fisk took control of various FBI agents, he was able to manipulate them into removing the Monitor whenever he wanted to leave the hotel.
Facilities
Fisk Residence: During his childhood, Fisk lived in a small apartment in Hell's Kitchen with his parents. Once, when Bill Fisk attacked Marlene, Fisk killed his father, smashing Bill's skull with the hammer. Together with Marlene, Fisk dumped Bill's body in the river, while most people assumed that Bill had left the city due to his debts to Don Rigoletto.

Wilson Fisk's Penthouse: Fisk acquired an expensive penthouse in New York City where he lived, once the penthouse was finally ready. Fisk used to arrange the meeting with his associates, such as Madame Gao and Leland Owlsley, to discuss the recent events and next moves. Later, Vanessa Marianna began to live together with Fisk at his penthouse. Eventually, as Fisk's illicit activity was exposed, the FBI stormed his apartment and had taken Fisk into custody.
Pier 81 Warehouse: Fisk used an abandoned warehouse building in docks to meet with his associates, like Nobu Yoshioka or Carl Hoffman. The building also was used to lure Daredevil into the trap, as he was attacked by Yoshioka. As Yoshioka was defeated, Fisk attacked Daredevil himself and ordered James Wesley to execute him. However, Daredevil managed to escape, leaping into the river.
Van Lunt Building: Fisk organized a fundraiser at the building, owned by Cornelius van Lunt, where he was thanking the guests for their donations. However, several guests were poisoned, including Vanessa Marianna, much to Fisk's ultimate horror. Taking Marianna, he rushed to the Metro-General Hospital to request medical treatment for her.

Presidential Hotel: Still imprisoned in Ryker's Island, Fisk managed to purchase the Presidential Hotel through the Vancorp, laundering money at Red Lion National Bank. As part of Fisk's schemes, he bribed Jasper Evans to attack him and forced the FBI to release him from the prison and relocate him in the secured facility. Despite the Albanian Syndicate's attack on the convoy, Fisk was brought to the Presidential Hotel where his sentence was supervised by the FBI. In fact, Fisk owned the whole hotel and secretly ordered to reconstruct his suite. Eventually, as Fisk's leads were useful, the FBI allowed Fisk to move within the hotel and returned him his confiscated property. Once the charges against Fisk were dropped, Fisk organized a wedding with Vanessa Marianna in the hotel and invited a lot of guests. However, the wedding was disrupted by Benjamin Poindexter and Daredevil, and Fisk was arrested by NYPD once again.
Red Fish Blue Restaurant: Having the FBI to apprehend several criminal bosses, Fisk ordered to bring them to the Red Fish Blue Restaurant. The agents completed the mission and stayed to watch for detainees. Fisk then arrived at the restaurant where he offered the bosses cooperation. Everett Starr declined the offer, resulting in his death by Benjamin Poindexter's hands. Rosalie Carbone, Latimer Zyl, John Hammer, and Sophia Carter then accepted the offer and Fisk left the restaurant.
Prisons

Ryker's Island: Following Fisk's arrest, he was brought to the Ryker's Island to serve his sentence. Despite Benjamin Donovan's best efforts, United States Department of Justice refused to drop the charges against Fisk, and he recommended Fisk to serve his sentence as quietly as possible. However, Fisk was encountered by Dutton, who had already managed to control half of the prison, much to Fisk's displeasure. Using the rest of his money, Fisk bribed several prisoners and guards, and even brought Frank Castle into Ryker's. Castle successfully murdered Dutton, which had allowed Fisk to take control over the prison. However, Fisk was annoyed by his scenery and cut the deal with the FBI, eventually forcing them to release him from Ryker's and relocate Fisk to the Presidential Hotel.

Behind the Scenes
Kingpin in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the third live-action incarnation of the character, following incarnations portrayed by John Rhys-Davies and Michael Clarke Duncan.
The cinematic rights for Kingpin seem to be shared by Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures Studios, as he appeared in the 2018 Sony Pictures Animation film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. This may be due to the fact that Kingpin originally appeared as an enemy of Spider-Man (whose rights are owned by Sony), yet he is usually depicted as the arch-enemy of Daredevil (whose rights are owned by Marvel Studios).
Pete Klein, Airon Armstrong, Matt Leonard, Chad Knorr, Aden Stay, and Jean-Claude Leuyer were stunt doubles for Vincent D'Onofrio and James Northrup was a stunt double for Cole Jensen in the role of Kingpin.
Kristoffe Brodeur was a stand-in for Vincent D'Onofrio in the role of Kingpin.
