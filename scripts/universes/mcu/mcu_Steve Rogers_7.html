<html><p>Enhanced Strength: Rogers' physical strength is enhanced to superhuman levels, beyond the peak of human potential. His incredible strength allows him to physically overpower elite-trained humans, extraterrestrial troops, and robot sentries. Rogers initially has shown visible effort in bending metal bars when he just used the serum, but later he effortlessly slam through solid walls and reinforced glass, pry open steel doors, and even briefly hold back an accelerating helicopter. Rogers also able to effortlessly crush a walkie-talkie from one of the German police officers in one hand and tear off a taxi door with ease. Rogers' immense strength allows for him to send enemies flying several meters in the air from mere punches and kicks during his fight. He can even generate enough force to have his shield pierce the metal frame of a Quinjet. During his USO tours, Rogers was able to lift a motorcycle frame with three showgirls sitting on top without any strain. With one hand, Rogers can lift a grown man over his head and throw him like a rag doll. He was also able to pull himself away from the immense magnetic force applied on his hand by a magnetic handcuff, which humans are impossible to achieve. Rogers was able to lift a large metal support beam to save a trapped Winter Soldier, while he was critically injured. He also supported falling debris from a small collapsing building to save Black Widow and himself from being crushed with the help from his shield. While chopping wood, Rogers easily ripped apart a block of a wood trunk in half with his bare hands. He was also able to throw a moving motorcycle at a jeep and with no required effort, and support the weight of an entire car during Ultron's initial attack on Sokovia. Rogers even stopped a helicopter, piloted by Winter Soldier from lifting off by pulling on its landing gear with extreme effort. In Lagos, Rogers kicked a 1.48-ton pickup truck with enough force to dent it and send an enemy soldier flying away upon impact. While Rogers' strength is rivalled by enhanced beings like Red Skull, Black Panther, Winter Soldier with his natural arm and Iron Man in his early armors, but surpassed by the likes of Winter Soldier via bionic arm, Corvus Glaive and Spider-Man, and outclassed by Loki, Ultron, Iron Man in his latest armors, Hulk, Thor and Thanos. Rogers' strength combined with his astonishingly effective muscle control, can greatly enhance his profound fighting skills, making him an incredibly formidable opponent. Rogers has shown to overpower extraterrestrial troops with ease, being able to easily overpower several Chitauri soldiers simultaneously, lifting, throwing and knocking them away with ease, even chopping their arms out with his shield, and with his vibranium gauntlets, he was able to tear through the durable skin of Outriders and kill many of them, as well as robots, he was able to easily overpower many Ultron Sentries and rip them apart with his bare hands. Moreover, Rogers' experience of unarmed and armed combatant allows him to subdue those of equal strength, such as when Rogers successfully overpowered Winter Soldier by restraining him while firmly breaking his arm and leaving him unconscious after an extended period of choke-holding him, successfully force him to drop the key. Later on, during Escape from the JCTC, Rogers was able to hold off Winter Soldier's cybernetic arm combined with his natural arm for a while, and using his both hands to briefly hold himself against Winter Soldier's cybernetic arm before being overpowered and got punched through an elevator shaft. He has shown to be strong enough to push back both Black Panther in his Panther Habit and War Machine with little difficulty, knocking Black Panther far away with a kick and grounding Rhodes in his armor while breaking his electro-staff, and later breaking out of Spider-Man's web and use it to pull Spider-Man to him and knocking him down repeatedly while holding back. With aid from Winter Soldier, Rogers was able to eventually overpower Iron Man in his Mark XLVI Armor by pummelling him and even forcing him to be pinned down even when he had activated his repulsors mid-fight, dismantle pieces of the armor and destroy its arc reactor with a single blow from his shield with great effort. Rogers was able to hold himself against Loki long enough for Stark to help him catch Loki, with him managing to slightly harm him with a strong-force kick and jab to the face. Rogers was able to hold himself against Ultron's second robotic body and even toss him through a solid pillar, hold back Midnight's attempt to stab Black Widow, and contend against Glaive to enough degree to effectively block his blows, even tackle him by ram against him and knock him down with a strong punch from his vibranium gauntlets. Even most impressively, with all his strength fuelling his determination, Rogers was able to hold his own against Thanos even though it only last for moments. Nevertheless, Rogers was able to slightly stagger Thanos with a few blows from his collapsible Wakandan shields and exerted all of his maximum potential strength with both his arms to briefly halt Thanos from closing his Infinity Gauntlet hand with five Infinity Stones already inserted, though he was nowhere nearly using his full strength, but this incredible feat of strength that eventually surprised Thanos, despite the fact he was completely unmatched for the Mad Titan. Later on, Rogers was able to make the 2014 Thanos slightly stumble with a kick to the head despite his helmet and momentarily restrain Thanos hard enough to make him grunt in discomfort while along with Thor gradually pushing Stormbreaker to Thanos' head, nearly succeeding in killing him and ultimately forcing Thanos to use both hands to swiftly overpower him and Thor. After Michael Peterson moved a bulldozer in further distance, he asked a S.H.I.E.L.D. trainer, who records the time, to see if he beat Rogers' time; however, a S.H.I.E.L.D. trainer replied that Peterson was "not even close" to beating Rogers' time record. In other words, Rogers was able to move a bulldozer much faster than Peterson himself. During the Battle at the HYDRA Siberian Facility, Iron Man's suit recorded his punching power at 1,346.206 newtons (302.6 pounds of force).
Enhanced Durability: Rogers' bones and muscles are denser and much harder than average humans, which makes him incredibly durable. Though he is not bulletproof, he can survive extreme blunt force trauma, such as being hit with solid objects like his own shield, or contact with superhuman opponents like Loki, the Winter Soldier, and the Red Skull. With his vibranium shield, he is capable of surviving falls from immense heights that would definitely kill a normal human. Rogers has been tasered, shot, stabbed, caught in several explosions, and taken several beatings including being blasted off of a causeway into a city bus by a launched grenade, falling from the 30th floor of the Triskelion while using his shield with little discomfort, and getting beaten by the metal arm of Winter Soldier in the face multiple times. With his enhanced physiology, Rogers was able to recover and continue fighting after taking such powerful blows in efficient time. Another example of his durability is when Rumlow tried to tase him with the Taser Rod, which he resisted for more than five seconds with endurable discomfort whereas ordinary humans would become unconscious almost immediately on contact. Rogers also dropped down to one of Project S.H.I.E.L.D. Insight's helicarrier from a considerable height without injury. Rogers was able to dive out of a Quinjet without a parachute into open water. He was able to survive both of Ultron's blasts and Iron Man's repulsors straight in the chest, as well as Scarlet Witch's telekinetic bolts and a super-accelerated punch from Quicksilver, all without any noticeable damage whatsoever, while he could get back up immediately after all of these. Rogers was even able to withstand being telekinetically knocked away by Thanos using the Infinity Gauntlet and quickly recover to stand against the Mad Titan for a while on his own. Even after being briefly incapacitated by a powerful punch from Thanos, who nowhere near used his full strength, Rogers was once again able to eventually get back up on his feet. He was later able to withstand powerful blows from 2014 Thanos even without Mj√∏lnir with only some bleeding scars and critical bruises.
Captain America and Black Panther running
Enhanced Speed: Rogers can run and move at speeds beyond the peak of human potential. He can catch up to or outrun speeding vehicles and cover a small area such as city blocks in seconds as well. Sam Wilson stated that Rogers ran thirteen miles in thirty minutes after their warm-up jogging. Even while completely unmatched, Rogers was quick enough to surprise Quicksilver before he gets back up and briefly stun him with his shield. Similarly, while overwhelmed by Thanos, Rogers was able to surprise him enough to land three hits on him. Although Rogers' speed rivals with Winter Soldier and Black Panther, they were capable of outrunning him in a chase due to their head start, forcing him to resort to hijacking a car to catch up. Nevertheless, at peak capacity, Rogers proves to be as fast as them, as shown during the Battle of Wakanda, when he ran at almost equal speeds with T'Challa when rushing towards the Outriders.
Enhanced Agility: Rogers' agility is far greater than that of an Olympic-gold medalist. He can coordinate his body with perfect balance, equilibrium, flexibility, and dexterity. While escaping the destruction of the HYDRA base that Bucky Barnes and the Howling Commandos were held captive in, Rogers was able to leap from one end of the complex to the other in order to escape. During his chase of the Winter Soldier, he was able to leap from the inside of his apartment into the building across the street. Rogers can leap over cars with simple running moves. Rogers can use his enhanced agility to perform amazing parkour and gymnastic moves that would be impossible for a normal human to accomplish.
Enhanced Stamina: Rogers' body eliminates the excessive build-up of fatigue-inducing lactic acid in his muscles and his musculature produces fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human, granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity, greater than of normal humans. Rogers could exert himself at peak capacity for several hours without showing any sign of fatigue, allowing him to fight for long periods of time. Additionally, Rogers can hold his breath underwater for several minutes and will not lose breath or get exhausted due to his stamina extending to his lung capacity. Rogers was able to run for 13 miles without any noticeable sign of fatigue. Rogers was also able to hold his breath underwater to intercept Heinz Kruger in his miniature submarine for brief periods of time. Moreover, Rogers has a higher level of endurance than a normal human.  It allows him to remain calm in stressful situations and able to endure high levels of pain.
Rogers catching Proxima Midnight's spear
Enhanced Reflexes: Rogers' reflexes are far superior to those of the finest human athletes. His reflexes allow him to dodge rapid gunfire at close range and was once able to evade gunfire from a Quinjet's Gatling gun with ease as he was accelerating towards the airship on his motorcycle. Rogers' auto-reflexes allow him to easily dodge gunfire, and respond quickly to fast-paced combat soldiers which they subdued by him before they can even aim their weapons on him. He also quickly dodged the accelerated helicopter blades that were coming towards him after pulling down the helicopter that the brainwashed Winter Soldier was flying in. His immense reflexes can also be used to attack and counter instead of just defensive purposes, allowing him to punish attacks with devastating counters when fighting extraordinary quick opponents. Rogers was also able to easily catch Proxima Midnight's spear when it was hurled at him, and even had enough reflexes to stop Thanos' left hand, which was adorned by the Infinity Gauntlet, before it could hit him, and was able to react to the 2014 Thanos' attacks and block them with his shield.
Enhanced Senses: Rogers' natural senses have been enhanced beyond the peak of human potential. He can see, hear, smell, feel, and taste things imperceptible to the normal humans. This allows him to see further, hear with amazing clarity, detect specific persons, objects, substances with his smell and so on. He was able to notice little things such as sweat drops trickling down a man's face to tip him off to danger. Rogers has also spotted a HYDRA soldier high up in a tree completely hidden when platoons of soldiers had no idea. Despite Barnes having stealthily sneaked behind Rogers in his apartment making no sound whatsoever, the latter was somehow immediately aware to the former's presence.
Regenerative Healing Factor: The Super Soldier Serum granted Rogers' physiology an accelerated rate of healing and regeneration. Rogers is immune to earthly infections, diseases, and disorders as well as cannot become intoxicated by alcohol, drugs, toxins, or impurities, thus he can't get drunk like his friends. Rogers' metabolic rate is able to withstand the consumption of Asgardian ale which was aged for a millennium in the barrels built from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet and deemed by Thor to not be intended for mortal men to drink. Rogers is capable of healing large cuts and bruises within hours and fatal gunshot wounds and fractures within several days. Rogers was able to regenerate from being shot in the stomach by a Chitauri gun directly in the abdomen in a matter of minutes. Rogers' injuries can heal and regenerate rapidly and perfectly without leaving a trace. Rogers is able to regain consciousness in a short amount of time after nearly dying. He is also immune to poisonous gas as shown in the Attack on the IFID Headquarters, when Rogers went into the building, he was completely unharmed from the poison effects whereas a terrorist soldier, whose gas mask been taken off by Rogers, was instantly suffering from the gas.
Longevity: As a result of the Super Soldier Serum, Rogers ages much slower than the normal human, a trait he shares with fellow super soldiers like Bucky Barnes and Isaiah Bradley. This kept him alive and halted his aging while being frozen in ice and placed in a cryogenic state for nearly seventy years. After being in the modern day for twelve years, Rogers time traveled from 2023 back to the 1949 and lived for approximately seventy years, and upon his return to 2023 had the bearings of a slightly younger man despite being biologically almost two hundred years old.
Former Powers
Powers via Mj√∏lnir: Due to the enchantments placed on the mystic hammer, Rogers was given the ability to focus on Thor's abilities and take advantage of them to considerably increase his abilities. The hammer also allowed him to easily take advantage of the weather elements.
Lightning Manipulation:     Rogers sending lightning to Thanos   While using Mj√∏lnir, Rogers gained the ability to summon bolts of lightning from the surrounding horizon. In addition to being able to channel electricity on its own, Mj√∏lnir can draw environmental electricity from the surrounding atmosphere and redirect it towards a specific goal, as was shown when Rogers was able to summon several bolts from the sky and briefly subdue Thanos with them. He also used the bolts during the battle against Thanos' army.
Physical Augmentation: After becoming worthy of Mj√∏lnir, all of Rogers' physical attributes such as his strength, speed and durability were increased to incredible superhuman levels, as he was able to overtake and topple Thanos, outpacing his sword blow and knocking him down, and proceed to land blows on Thanos that were strong enough to knock him over and hurt him, even damaging his helmet, with the hammer and swiftly get back up on his feet with no injuries upon being roughly slammed to the ground by Thanos, before being ultimately overpowered and disarmed of the hammer by the Mad Titan.
Weapon Summoning: Mj√∏lnir obeyed Rogers' summons as though it was driven by a form of intelligence. Rogers didn't seem to have total control of this ability, as on at least one occasion, he accidentally summoned Stormbreaker instead.

Abilities
Rogers fighting against Crossbones
Master Martial Artist: Rogers is an incredibly skilled master hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist, having extensive levels of knowledge of melee combat as well as being considerably experienced in combat operations, making him one of the most dangerous and best fighters on the planet. He has mastered numerous martial arts such as muay Thai, boxing, Krav Maga, Taekwondo, savate, wushu, judo, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, kickboxing, wrestling, aikido, karate, and wing chun. Even in World War II, when he was still inexperienced, Captain America has already proven to be a skilled fighter, having used his knowledge of combat, his enhanced attributes, and shield to defeat hundreds of Nazi soldiers with ease and even Red Skull himself. After being defrosted in the 21st century, Rogers was quickly put into action again and remained as skilled as ever; he was able to stand against Loki in combat, holding him long enough for Iron Man to aid him by arresting him, hold his own against an enraged Thor during their first encounter to standstill with aid of his shield, and also managed to defeat hordes of Chitauri aliens at the Battle of New York. When a police officer questioned why Rogers should take orders from him, the latter easily defeated several attacking Chitauri soldiers, inducing the impressed officer to follow his orders without question. When he joined S.H.I.E.L.D., Rogers received more extensive training and became even more skilled in hand-to-hand combats and martial artists, proving more than capable of defeating several armed pirates, soldiers of HYDRA, a dozen STRIKE agents while limited by the confined space of an elevator, as well as having Georges Batroc knocked out in a one-on-one fight with ease. Captain America have enough skill to evenly matched against opponents like Black Panther and Winter Soldier. He was able to fight on par against both Black Panther and War Machine at the same time, sometimes even gain the upper hand in their first fight, though it should be noted that Black Panther's vengeance and full intentions wasn't targeting on Rogers but instead Winter Soldier, and War Machine didn't used any lethal weapons which only used an non-lethal hammer to attack him. He was also able to equally fought against the notorious Winter Soldier in combat, being able to go toe-to-toe with him in their first fight and ultimately defeating the latter by putting him in a chokehold in their second fight, while their last fight ended in Barnes' victory due to Rogers being caught off guard, he was able to block most of Barnes' blows during all of their battles. He was also able to match and eventually defeat an armored Crossbones. Rogers is even able to use his combat skills to hold his own against or even defeat considerably stronger opponents, with him swiftly beating the inexperienced Spider-Man while holding back, holding his own against and landing some hits on Loki, giving Ultron's second body a prolonged fight, easily overwhelming Iron Man in hand-to-hand combat and forcing him to use F.R.I.D.A.Y.'s advanced combat analysis, with even then Tony needing to use his repulsors to overwhelm him briefly, and yet eventually still win against Iron Man with aid from Winter Soldier, who distracted Iron Man by grabbing onto his leg before getting hit. Rogers easily disarmed and competed against Corvus Glaive shortly before Glaive could gain the upper hand, and even ultimately managing to briefly hold his own alone against Thanos himself, even landing three punches on the Mad Titan in quick succession and just barely managing to stop a blow from Thanos, although he was quickly beaten, as well as later on holding off the 2014 Thanos long enough for Iron Man and Thor to prepare a coordinated attack. Rogers also managed to defeat hordes of Ultron Sentries during the Battle of Sokovia, best and kill many Outriders during the Battle of Wakanda, and numerous Chitauri, Sakaarans, and Outriders during the Battle of Earth. Furthermore, he ultimately defeated his 2012 counterpart by outwitting him in combat and using Loki's Scepter to subdue him.
Captain America throws his shield at HYDRA
Shield Mastery: Rogers' years of training and experience with his unique shield, as well as its physical properties, making him extremely skilled in wielding it and allowing him to accomplish amazing feats with the item. Rogers is able to throw it with perfect aim, managing to slice Spider-Man's webbing with it mid-air. Rogers can hit multiple targets with the same throw by means of ricochet, and could even achieve a boomerang-like return effect, allowing him to strike enemies from behind or retrieve the shield without objects to ricochet from. Additionally, Rogers can perform combination techniques with his allies, such as allowing Thor to strike his shield to create a directed shockwave at HYDRA soldiers, jumping and catching his shield thrown by Hawkeye and throwing it at an Ultron Sentry before landing on the ground, and allowing Thor to strike his shield's edge with his hammer to send it through multiple Ultron Sentries. He is also extremely skilled in using it in close combat to bash aside foes and block incoming attacks, even from extremely skilled weapon masters such as Thor with his hammer and even Thanos using his sword. Beside his own vibranium shield, Rogers' skill also applies to other different shields, as he was able to wield the Wakandan shields given to him for the Battle of Wakanda very expertly as blunt weapons, killing many Outriders and managing to combat and even disarm Corvus Glaive as well as even land a few hits on Thanos. Rogers can use his signature shield in conjunction with other weapons like Thor's hammer and Stormbreaker with equal, if not even greater effect. Rogers was even able to wield his shield effectively after it was broken by Thanos.
Spear Mastery: Rogers is highly skilled at fighting with a spear in close combat, managing to use Corvus Glaive's weapon to fight and disarm Proxima Midnight of her spear alongside Black Widow.
Captain America wields his shield and Mj√∏lnir
Hammer Mastery: Rogers displayed outstanding skill with the mighty Asgardian war hammer Mj√∏lnir, after he had been found worthy of wielding it, able to briefly overtake Thanos, landing several vicious blows, and could easily take down many Outriders with it. He could also throw it accurately to hit his shield after having previously thrown it to the air to generate a shockwave to stun Thanos.
Axe Mastery: Rogers is highly skilled in fighting with an axe, able to effectively wield Stormbreaker to easily kill off several Outriders, whenever he and Thor traded weapons.
Master Marksman: Rogers can throw projectile weaponry with great accuracy and is well-versed in the use of firearms like the military-issued Colt 1911 or the Thompson submachine gun during World War II and eventually modern firearms, picking up a Noveske N4 Diplomat and using it with ease. While he knew how to use the modern assault rifle, he was not used to it and missed his targets each time he fired, even slipped from the platform he stood on when he caught in a hail of gunfire from the men that he was fighting on the Helicarrier, but managed to grab a wire to stay on the ship. Moreover, Rogers is extremely skilled in shield throwing, being able to throw his Vibranium shield with unerring accuracy. Rogers also shows expertise in knife throwing, as seen during the Battle in the Valkyrie, the Attack on the Helicarrier, and the Hijacking and Retaking of the Lemurian Star, being able to accurately hit his targets. During the Clash of the Avengers, Rogers accurately threw a miniaturized truck at one of Lang's Pym Particles Disks.
Captain America kicking at Georges Batroc
Master Acrobat: Rogers' years of training and experience have made him an highly skilled acrobat, gymnast, and aerialist, being able to fluidly dodge attacks from multiple directions using coordinated flips, twists, and sharp turns without losing balance. He often utilizes these talents in combat for both evasive and offensive purposes. Combined with his enhanced agility, Rogers has shown expertise in utilizing parkour and tricking flips in his attacks and takedowns.
Master Spy: Aside from being a veteran soldier and one of the world's greatest combatants and martial artists, Rogers is highly skilled in espionage, intelligence gathering, stealth, infiltration, and sabotage. During World War II, Rogers and the Howling Commandos successfully raided several HYDRA bases, rescued Allied POWs, and captured top HYDRA scientist, Dr. Arnim Zola. After being revived in the 21st century, despite his lack of knowledge of the current technologies, he managed to sneak around in the Helicarrier without getting caught and discovered S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Tesseract-based weaponry. When Rogers received additional training from S.H.I.E.L.D., he became a highly accomplished spy in his own right. He participated in several black-ops missions with STRIKE and helped thwart the HYDRA Uprising. Rogers, Romanoff and Wilson easily infiltrated Fort Meade to retrieve the EXO-7 Falcon, despite it being protected by three guarded gates and a foot-long steel wall. He and Stark also successfully infiltrated Camp Lehigh, absconding with the Tesseract and Pym Particles. He successfully evaded capture from authorities when he became a fugitive twice (during the HYDRA Uprising and Avengers Civil War). However, Rogers' most impressive feat was breaking into an underwater highly secured prison, the Raft, and freeing his fellow Avengers with exceptional difficulty.
Master Tactician: Rogers is an excellent strategist and tactical genius. He can formulate battle strategies and his brilliant tactical sense allows him to alter near any strategy to fit the changing needs of the situation. A prime example is when he formulated the plan to go in first by himself in "the front door" of Red Skull's hidden base. After taking out the Red Skull's defenses and feigning a surrender, the assault team and then the full force of the Strategic Scientific Reserve came in and raided the base following Rogers' initial assault. His tactical brilliance also came into play during the Chitauri assault on New York, first in organizing first responders to protect the civilian population, and then re-deploying other members of the Avengers to best defend the city with their limited resources. While not as intelligent as Tony Stark or Bruce Banner nor possessing Clint Barton's keen awareness, Rogers frequently proved himself a quick study in battlefield situations being able to quickly ascertain details from minor actions. His bravery and determination further supplement this as he is willing to take even the riskiest of choices to stand a chance to win, a trait best exemplified when he was quickly able to deduce the HYDRA personnel in an elevator were about to attack him and provoked them into attacking him. He again demonstrated this skill when Thanos arrived in Wakanda, quickly realizing that the Infinity Gauntlet had to be clenched for access to its powers and bravely charging the warlord to hold his hand open. As seen during World War II and the Chitauri Invasion, Captain America has demonstrated impressive charisma and leadership skills. Rogers was able to command respect from his fellow Avengers and the undying loyalty of his Howling Commandos. Rogers' extraordinary ability to not only inspire the nobility in others but also assess combat situations and come up with effective strategies made his fellow Avengers recognize him as the leader of their team. During the Chitauri attack on New York, Captain America focused on directing civilian authorities to keep the citizens safe and off the streets while the rest of the Avengers focused their efforts on taking out the Chitauri's military assets. Even when outnumbered by the forces of HYDRA within S.H.I.E.L.D., Steve was able to get Wilson, Hill, Romanoff, and even Fury, along with the loyal agents within S.H.I.E.L.D. to fight back against HYDRA and stop Project Insight from being achieved. As a result, Rogers dealt HYDRA their first devastating blow in decades, since he fought against them in World War II.
Rogers drawing how he viewed himself
Skilled Artist: Before fighting in the War, Rogers took art classes at Auburndale Art School from 1937 to 1938. During the war and his tour, Rogers kept a notebook of his drawings that showed his discontent as a mascot. Peggy Carter even kept his drawing of himself as a monkey in her retirement home. After being defrosted, Rogers retained his artistic skills, as he vividly sketched Stark Tower on a napkin outside a restaurant.
Pilot: Rogers has at least basic knowledge of aircraft piloting. In the 1940s, he crash-landed Red Skull's plane on the Arctic. After returning, he has proven the capability to fly a Quinjet.
Multilingualism: Rogers speaks his native English, as well as fluent French, which he used to communicate with Georges Batroc. He also understands Arabic.
Equipment
Weapons
As a weapon of choice, Rogers uses a round shaped vibranium shield, which can be used as a throwing weapon and is able to absorb any kind of impact. Rogers has also been known to utilize various firearms.

USO Shield: The prop shield Rogers used during his campaign across United States of America, where he promoted the purchase of war bonds as "Captain America".
Captain America carries his shield into battle
Vibranium Shield: Rogers' primary weapon is his concave disk shield. The shield is about 2.5 feet in diameter, weighing 12 pounds painted in its familiar red-white-and-blue pattern with a five-pointed star design in its center, constructed by Howard Stark and made from Vibranium only. The vibranium composition allows the shield to absorb and reflect kinetic energy from impacts, therefore, making it nigh-indestructible. Nearly every kind of human weaponry cannot even dent it, as bullets normally bounce off it. The shield is also strong enough to combat magic and mystical weapons, such as Thor's hammer Mj√∏lnir. It also withstood Iron Man's repulsors, deflecting them in a coordinated team attack. The shield's shape makes it a superb throwing weapon. It can cut through the air with minimal wind resistance. It is also able to bounce off solid objects, such as walls and floors, when struck on its edge and can be ricocheted off of multiple surfaces. It also makes a formidable and devastating hand-held weapon. Combined with Rogers' strength and combat skills, it enables him to plow through virtually any opponent. The vibranium in the shield also enables Rogers to withstand great falls and devastating blows that he couldn't otherwise. At the end of the Avengers Civil War, Rogers surrendered the shield to Tony Stark acknowledging that Howard Stark had made it and he had proven unworthy of it. However, its durability was finally put to the limit when fighting Thanos; after repeated strikes from the titan's double-blade, combined with Thanos' immense strength, eventually broke it in half.
Rogers preparing his sidearm
Colt M1911A1: Rogers was issued an M1911A1 as his sidearm during World War II. He took one of them in an unauthorized mission to liberate Bucky Barnes in a HYDRA facility in Austria, and continued to use it during the rest of the war, especially in his attacks against HYDRA all over Europe and the capture of Arnim Zola. The pistol is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution.
M1 Garand: Rogers has issued an M1 Garand rifle for his training maneuvers in Camp Lehigh. However, he never used it for actual combat during World War II. The rifle is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution.
M1921 Thompson: Before joining World War II, Rogers played a colorful character named Captain America in a series of live shows and films. In those films, he used an M1928A1 Thompson to attack Nazis and protect America, inspiring soldiers to join the United States Armed Forces and citizens to buy war bonds.
Captain America wielding an assault rifle
Noveske N4 Diplomat: Captain America took one of these rifles from one of the mercenaries that attacked the Helicarrier, and used it to defend his position while helping Tony Stark to restart the aircraft's propellers.
M67 Grenade: Rogers obtained a grenade from one of the HYDRA operatives patrolling one of the Project Insight Helicarriers, using it to attack a group of operatives while infiltrating the aircraft.
Proxima Midnight's Spear: Rogers briefly used Proxima Midnight's weapon when rescuing Vision, catching it after Midnight threw it to him and quickly passing it to Black Widow so she could impale Corvus Glaive.
Corvus Glaive's Glaive: Rogers temporarily used Corvus Glaive's weapon in combat with Proxima Midnight. Together with Black Widow, Rogers managed to disarm and defeat Midnight before they escaped. The glaive then was aspired back and also returned to the owner.
Rogers preparing to fight Thanos
Wakandan Shields: Rogers was given two-handed shields in Wakanda, capable of collapsing to be smaller and used as gauntlets for punching. The shield's points are incredibly sharp, creating an offensive weapon, being able to pierce the skin of Outriders. He used them to go against Thanos himself, even managing to strike him three times in quick succession.
Scepter: During the Time Heist, Captain America stole the Scepter from the STRIKE team carrying it and convinced Jasper Sitwell that he had orders to take the Scepter after whispering "Hail HYDRA" to his ear. After stealing the Scepter, Captain America accidentally ran into his past self and engaged him in combat after the latter mistook him for Loki in disguise. Captain America defeated his past self by distracting him by informing him Bucky Barnes was alive and then knocked him out using the Scepter. Captain America then gave the Scepter to Ant-Man to return it to the present while he and Iron Man stayed in the past to steal the Space Stone.
Captain America wielding Mj√∏lnir
Mj√∏lnir: During a party held to celebrate the capture of Wolfgang von Strucker, the Avengers took turns trying to lift Thor's hammer, during which Rogers was able to slightly budge it. Much later, during the final battle with Thanos, Rogers revealed that he was able to lift Mj√∏lnir and wield it to great effect against Thanos. Thor was delighted, having been suspicious that Rogers had been worthy all along.
Stormbreaker: Much like Mj√∏lnir, Rogers was able to wield Stormbreaker in the final conflict with Thanos. However, his time with Stormbreaker was brief as Rogers summoned it by accident, giving it back to Thor at his request.
Other Equipment
Uniform: Rogers and Howard Stark both designed the original suit he wore during the war. It was made of carbon polymer and it offers a medium level of resistance to gunfire. The helmet also served as a mask. It also allowed for a sidearm. The shield could be attached to the back. However, upon his reawakening and him joining the Avengers, S.H.I.E.L.D., along with input from Phil Coulson, designed his new upgraded suit. It has more flexibility and mobility than his previous suit. The new suit carries a wireless communicator. The uniform was composed of a Nomex and Kevlar fiber. While it did not allow for him carrying a sidearm, nonetheless, it was bulletproof and fireproof. It could also withstand blunt force trauma and energy blasts from alien weaponry.
Compass: A device that allows him to navigate easily, due to the fact that it indicates direction. On the inside, it contains a photo of Peggy Carter, specifically on the lid.
