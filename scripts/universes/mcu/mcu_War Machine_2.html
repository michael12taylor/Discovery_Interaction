<html><p>In order to do what they could to protect the civilians, Iron Man then forced War Machine and the Air Force drones to chase him out of the Expo, flying above parked cars. However, War Machine had noticed that Vanko was sending multiple Hammer Drones back into the Expo to target civilians, before warning Iron Man that he had managed to get a target lock on him. Vanko then forced War Machine to fire all of his weapons at Iron Man, causing a massive explosion.

War Machine realizes what Iron Man planned
Needing to do something to take out the pursuing Hammer Drones, Iron Man confirmed that War Machine and the Drones were all still locked onto him, before charging full speed towards the globe statue in the center of the Expo. War Machine realized what was about to happen in time as his suit was able to divert and avoid the globe, while the robotic Hammer drones had then all smashed straight into it, causing a fireball that destroyed dozens more of Vanko's drones.

War Machine and Iron Man continuing to fight
With most of the Hammer Drones now destroyed, War Machine alone was forced to attack Iron Man, knocking him out of the air before the two friends wrestled on the ground. With War Machine unable to stop Vanko's programming, he was then forced to fire his mini-gun at Iron Man's head, who was barely able to avoid the bullets. Fortunately, with the help of Black Widow and Happy Hogan, War Machine was finally freed from Vanko's control and then thrown backward.

Showdown with Whiplash
War Machine being helped back onto his feet
Following Black Widow successfully managing to reboot his armor, War Machine was briefly knocked out from the final hit and awoke to find Iron Man tapping on his helmet, asking him to get back. War Machine noted that Stark could have the Mark II Armor back if he wanted it. As Hammer Drones were incoming, Iron Man helped War Machine back onto his feet before they apologized to each other.

War Machine and Iron Man making their plan
The pair then agreed to work together to battle the Hammer Drones and began creating a plan on how to defeat them. However, this soon led to an argument over who was the leader out of them, since War Machine had insisted that his Mark I Armor was superior to Iron Man's Mark IV, thanks to all the weaponry that Justin Hammer designed. They continued to argue about where Iron Man should be based during the fight, struggling to come to a decision on their plan.

War Machine and Iron Man prepare to fight
Before either War Machine or Iron Man could make a decision about how to prepare for the fight, their argument was interrupted by the arrival of all the Hammer Drones, who completely surrounded the pair and put them into the worst position, with Ivan Vanko's drones blocking all their exits and all their guns trained on them both. However, rather than be intimidated by all the odds being stacked up against them, War Machine and Iron Man put their helmets back on and readied their weapons, before the Hammer Drones had proceeded to charge forward and begun shooting.

War Machine battling all the Hammer Drones
As the Drones were attacking, War Machine and Iron Man used every weapon in their arsenals to fight back against them, with War Machine deploying all the guns on his hands and the mini-gun on his back to tear the drones all apart before they could get close. While War Machine's guns dismantled the Drones, Iron Man used wrist-mounted missiles to destroy three in one go, with War Machine complimenting him while they continued fighting side-by-side.

War Machine tearing a Hammer Drone apart
Although War Machine and Iron Man fired every weapon they had at the Drone army, before long they both appeared to be completely overwhelmed by the numbers as they struggled to hold them back. Finally, Iron Man ordered War Machine to drop to the ground before he used a laser to cut them all in half. Getting back onto his feet, War Machine then commented that Iron Man should have used it earlier, to which Iron Man had admitted that it could only be used once.

War Machine witnesses Whiplash's arrival
Despite all of the Hammer Drones being destroyed, War Machine and Iron Man were then warned by Black Widow that another, much larger target was heading straight towards them. The two of them then witnessed the arrival of Ivan Vanko, who was wearing an upgraded Whiplash Armor. Seeing this, War Machine commented that this would not be good, just as Whiplash then demonstrated his upgraded whips, powered by a new version of the Arc Reactor which was considerably more dangerous than anything they had faced.

War Machine shoots the Ex-Wife at Whiplash
Seeking to end the fight before it could even begin, War Machine had stepped forward and attempted to use the Ex-Wife Missile to destroy Whiplash. However, as soon as War Machine had fired the missile, it simply bounced off Whiplash's armor and malfunctioned on the floor. Seeing this pathetic attempt, Iron Man then questioned if that missile was built by Hammer Industries, which an embarrassed War Machine had confirmed while Whiplash prepared to begin their fight.

War Machine continues shooting at Whiplash
Whiplash then attacked both War Machine and Iron Man, separating them as War Machine unloaded every weapon he had in an attempt to break through Whiplash's armor. However, Whiplash responded by striking at War Machine with one of his electric whips, tearing off his mini-gun, before attacking Iron Man. War Machine continued shooting at Whiplash to protect Iron Man before then being strangled with the electric whip and punched straight across the battlefield.

War Machine becomes trapped by Whiplash
It soon became clear that they were greatly outmatched by Whiplash as he managed to strangle Iron Man with his electric whip while also pinning War Machine to the ground. Despite Iron Man attempting to free him, Whiplash had still managed to wrap his second electric whip around War Machine's throat and he began slowly strangling the pair, who were unable to break free. However, Iron Man made it clear that he had a plan to defeat Whiplash with the help of War Machine.

War Machine and Iron Man defeat Whiplash
Iron Man instructed War Machine to raise his hand up so they could then both fire their repulsor beams at each other as they had done during their last fight at Stark's mansion, which had then caused a massive shockwave. Although War Machine was highly skeptical of this plan, with little time remaining he did as Iron Man suggested. They caused a shockwave directly beside Whiplash, resulting in great damage to his armor as they were freed from his grasp.

War Machine stands over the beaten Whiplash
With Whiplash defeated, War Machine and Iron Man then got back to their feet and had stood over him, finding that his armor had been damaged beyond repair and he had fatal injuries across his body. As they looked down at Whiplash, he claimed that they had lost, before his armor began flashing red, along with those other broken Hammer Drones. To their horror, War Machine and Iron Man realized they had been set to explode all across the Stark Expo. Iron Man immediately launched into the air to rescue Pepper Potts before the Drones could detonate, with War Machine following close behind.

Rhodes in the damaged War Machine armor
Iron Man was successful in saving Potts and managed to pull her out of the Expo moments before the Drones exploded, resulting in Whiplash's death. Iron Man had then brought Potts onto the same rooftop that War Machine was waiting on, failing to notice that he was there. Potts tried to resign from Stark Industries due to all of the stress that she was feeling, which Iron Man then responded to by simply kissing her, prompting War Machine to then tease the couple by claiming they were acting like "two seals fighting over a grape".

War Machine leaves the scene with his armor
While War Machine and Iron Man complemented each other in their battle against Whiplash and the Hammer Drones, War Machine then explained that his car had been destroyed in the explosions, meaning that he would have to take the armor with him to get home. Although Iron Man still insisted that he was not okay with that, War Machine replied that it was not a question and simply flew into the air with the armor, leaving Iron Man and Potts alone on the roof.

Honored by Stern
Rhodes is presented with a medal from Stern
In the wake of their clash with Whiplash at the Stark Expo, Rhodes and Tony Stark were to be awarded medals for their bravery. Having made a deal with Nick Fury, Stark managed to arrange for Senator Stern to award the medals to him and Rhodes, much to Stern's annoyance due to his dislike of Stark, as he was forced to make a speech praising them.

Rhodes and Tony Stark are honored by Stern
Stern had shown great reluctance to be presenting the pair with their medals for bravery, as he congratulated Rhodes for his exceptionally distinguished performance in defeating Whiplash, telling him that he deserved the medal while struggling to look him in the eyes. Rhodes then watched with amusement while Stern gave Stark his medal before posing for the press photos, with Stark giving a peace symbol to the cameras while Rhodes smiled.

Iron Patriot
Hunting the Ten Rings
Rhodes becomes re-branded as Iron Patriot
Following the defeat of Whiplash, War Machine's Mark I armor was upgraded by Tony Stark before he went out to hunt down members of the Ten Rings. During this time, War Machine was called to assist in the Battle of New York, but he arrived after the Avengers had already defeated the Chitauri Invasion and then found them in a Shawarma Palace. Following this, Stark took Rhodes to his Mansion and revealed that he was developing the Iron Legion, a unit of his remote-controlled Iron Man Armors that were designed to assist with their protection of the world.

Iron Patriot poses for pictures with Rodriguez
In response to the Chitauri Invasion, and as attacks from the Ten Rings seemingly continued across the United States of America under the Mandarin's leadership, Rhodes personally recruited by President Matthew Ellis to combat these attacks; his Mark II armor was then upgraded and rebranded by A.I.M. to turn him into the Iron Patriot, whose mission was to find and defeat the Mandarin for good.

Lunch with Tony Stark
Rhodes and Tony Stark discussing Iron Patriot
Rhodes met with Tony Stark at Neptune's Net where Stark had teased him over his rebrand to the Iron Patriot, although Rhodes still insisted that the Mark II's name change tested better with the general public. Changing their subject, Stark asked about the Mandarin and what was being done to stop the ongoing terrorist attacks, although Rhodes insisted that this was classified information.

Rhodes telling Tony Stark about the Mandarin
Despite his reluctance, Rhodes explained to Stark about how there had been nine recent bombings across the United States of America linked to the Ten Rings and the Mandarin, although the general public only knew about three of these. As Rhodes revealed how they had been unable to find the cause of the explosions, Stark insisted that he could help, explaining that he had recently created technology which was ideal for this mission to track down the Mandarin.

Rhodes being interrupted by young children
As Stark discussed his additions to the Iron Legion, Rhodes simply asked when he last got some sleep, expressing his own concern for Stark's wellbeing. As the pair began to argue, they were interrupted by two young children who wanted Stark to sign a drawing they had made depicting Iron Man fighting the Chitauri back in New York City. Rhodes had then gone on to discuss how the Pentagon was reacting to the Mandarin, noting that the Avengers should not get involved.

Rhodes witnessing Tony Stark's panic attack
However, while Rhodes was speaking, Stark had begun to have a panic attack seeing the drawing of him going through the Wormhole during the Chitauri Invasion. As he got up and charged out of the bar, Rhodes quickly followed his friend outside and found Stark had stepped inside his Mark VII, still trying to figure out what was happening. As Rhodes tried to help by noting that this looked bad, Stark claimed he had to go, pushing Rhodes back before launching into the sky.

Search for the Mandarin
The Iron Patriot hunting down the Mandarin
While Iron Patriot had continued hunting down the Mandarin, he learned that Tony Stark had seemingly been killed by the Mandarin's soldiers when his Mansion was destroyed. Iron Patriot continued looking for the Ten Rings' leader with intel from President Matthew Ellis in the hopes of finally bringing the Mandarin to justice, although much of this intel he was being provided led to nothing.

Iron Patriot locates some Ten Rings members
During one raid in Pakistan, Iron Patriot burst inside a room filled with potential Ten Rings members, catching them all off-guard as he aimed all of the Mark II's weaponry at them and ordered them not to move. However, Iron Patriot's threats were undermined when he received a call which caused him to pause. Answering the call, Iron Patriot realized it was Stark, who told him about an encounter he had just had with Ellen Brandt and her Extremis powers, before noting how the last time he went missing, Rhodes had searched for him.

Iron Patriot learning Tony Stark is still alive
Once Rhodes had confirmed that the recent Iron Patriot redesign was done by A.I.M., Stark insisted upon getting Rhodes' password so he could hack into the security files and learn more about Aldrich Killian's possible connection with all the Mandarin attacks. Despite being somewhat reluctant, Rhodes confessed that his password was "WARMACHINEROX", much to the amusement of both Stark and several of the terrorists, as Stark left to continue his mission.

Captured by A.I.M.
Iron Patriot continues hunting the Mandarin
While flying high above Pakistan, Iron Patriot had been contacted by President Matthew Ellis with a possible new location of the Mandarin, as they believed they had tracked down the broadcasting location from his recent video threats. Iron Patriot proceeded to fly down and charge into the location, with the Mark II's weaponry pointed at everyone.

Iron Patriot realizes he has false intel yet again
However, much to Iron Patriot's considerable frustration, he had then discovered that the room only contained women seemingly working in a sweatshop. While Iron Patriot had expressed his own frustration at the United States Armed Forces for sending him more incorrect information, all the female workers then began leaving the sweatshop, before Iron Patriot had then realized he had inadvertently freed them from imprisonment as they all began thanking him.

Iron Patriot's armor is suddenly taken down
While Iron Patriot awkwardly accepted the gratitude, he shook hands with one of the women and was ambushed by her Extremis attack, which had caused the Mark II armor to shut down and he fell to the floor, trapped inside. As the Sweat Shop Agent then phoned up Eric Savin with an update on the situation, Iron Patriot proclaimed that he would not allow them to take the armor away from him, but the Extremis agent simply assured they would kill him to do so.

Tortured by Aldrich Killian
Rhodes refuses to step out the Mark II armor
Having been captured by the A.I.M. soldiers, Rhodes was then taken into a Mansion where Aldrich Killian's guards then spent several hours attempting to cut him out from the Mark II armor. However, Rhodes insisted that he would not allow them to get their hands onto the armor, since they planned to then use it to kidnap President Matthew Ellis. He had remained locked inside until Killian became frustrated by all of his soldier's lack of results and decided to get involved himself.

Rhodes is slowly boiled alive by Aldrich Killian
While Eric Savin and the other scientists watched on, Killian stepped up to the Iron Patriot armor and had rested his hand on the stomach plating, as he then used his Extremis powers to begin heating up the suit. While Rhodes felt his armor heating up and slowing boiling him alive, Savin warned that what Killian was doing would likely damage the armor, although neither he nor Killian showed any concern for Rhodes, who still refused to open the armor, despite the pain.

Rhodes avoids being burnt by Aldrich Killian
However, in spite of all of Rhodes' attempts to keep the suit locked, its defensive systems forced it to open up in order to save Rhodes from being burnt to death. With no other choice, Rhodes launched out of the suit and then attempted to put up a fight, punching Savin to the ground. When Killian had then used his Extremis powers to breath flames at him though, a stunned Rhodes gave in. Savin then used his superior strength to shove Rhodes into a wall headfirst, knocking him unconscious.

Finding the Mandarin
Rhodes escapes from Aldrich Killian's capture
Rhodes eventually awoke and found that Eric Savin managed to take control of the Iron Patriot Armor, as he used it to kidnap President Matthew Ellis while under the guise of Rhodes. Having gotten free, Rhodes took down several nearby guards before calling Tony Stark and confirming he had not left in the suit. Stark then told Rhodes to meet him by the main house to see somebody.

Rhodes shoots Aldrich Killian's armed guards
Rhodes and Stark formed a plan to capture the Mandarin once and for all. Stark made himself known to the armed guards while he was wearing his Mark XLII, causing them to shoot at him while Rhodes dove through a glass doorway and shot them both dead. With the guards taken care of, Rhodes and Stark then found their supposed Mandarin sitting in an armchair with a beer while watching a football game on the television.

Rhodes threatening to shoot Trevor Slattery
Stark introduced Rhodes to the Mandarin, who was actually just a British actor named Trevor Slattery whom Aldrich Killian had paid to be his decoy while he carried out Extremis experiments, much to Rhodes' disbelief. Although Slattery immediately tried to defend his actions, Stark made it clear that he was not playing as Rhodes used his smoking gun to burn Slattery's ear before they interrogated him on a kidnapped Pepper Potts' whereabouts and what Killian was planning, although Slattery clearly did not know much.

Rhodes and Iron Man speak to Trevor Slattery
While Slattery was completely unaware of what had happened with Rhodes' Mark II suit or anything about Potts, since he was more interested with the ongoing football watch, he did reveal that Vice President Rodriguez might be involved in Killian's orchestrated conspiracy. As Rhodes and Stark tried to formulate a plan, they decided to take control of the speedboat that Slattery had previously mentioned to Stark, which he had been provided by Killian as a payment.

Stopping Aldrich Killian
Rhodes and Stark decide on their next move
Rhodes and Tony Stark then rode on Trevor Slattery's speedboat as they tried to get control of the situation. As they were traveling, they got in contact with and warned Vice President Rodriguez that Iron Patriot was actually Eric Savin who planned to kidnap President Matthew Ellis. Rodriguez promised that he would send F-22 Raptors to ensure that President Ellis was safe from harm.

Rhodes trying to communicate with Rodriguez
As they continued traveling, Rhodes had made it clear to Stark that they could either decide to save President Ellis or Pepper Potts, but not both. However, the decision was made for them as Rodriguez did not pass on the message about Aldrich Killian's attack, being secretly in league with Killian in an attempt from the latter to gain control over the United States of America, and they learned that Savin was now attacking Air Force One.

Rhodes learning Matthew Ellis has been lost
Stark used his remote-controlled Mark XLII to fly onto the Air Force One Plane, killing Savin and rescuing airborne passengers from death when Savin had destroyed the airplane. However, Savin had placed Ellis inside the Iron Patriot suit and sent him to the Norco. Following this mission, Rhodes had checked on Stark, who was wearing the Telepresence Headset, as Stark confirmed that Iron Legion was ready for deployment, although Ellis was captured by Killian.

Battle on the Norco
Rhodes and Tony Stark look for Aldrich Killian
Rhodes and Tony Stark then infiltrated Roxxon's Norco with the mission to save both Pepper Potts and President Matthew Ellis. As they both made their way onto the docks, avoiding the A.I.M. guards, Rhodes questioned if Stark was going to have another panic attack, although Stark promised that he would not. Eventually, the pair found President Ellis, who had been encased in the Iron Patriot Armor and suspended high above them from a crane, awaiting public live execution. The two charged upstairs to try and free Ellis.

Rhodes witnessing the Iron Legion's arrival
As they continued onwards, Rhodes gave Stark instructions on how to protect himself, until they were spotted by A.I.M. guards, who began shooting down at them. As they took cover, Rhodes proved himself as the superior marksman by shooting out the light bulb, before they argued about who should get more ammunition. Looking around the docks, Stark noted that several Extremis Soldiers were now heading to them. As Rhodes expressed a desire to get his Mark II armor back, Stark pointed to the far off distance and revealed that he had already summoned his Iron Legion as backup, as they surrounded the docks and were directed to attack all the Soldiers as Rhodes watched on.

Rhodes being told he will not be getting a suit
Rhodes watched as J.A.R.V.I.S. took control of the Legion and began attacking the soldiers, witnessing Stark sending out Igor to go steady the tower they were on. As Stark put on the Silver Centurion, Rhodes excitedly asked if he would get to wear one of these new suits, but Stark revealed that the only armor that would work on him was the Iron Patriot. Rhodes was instead given the Heartbreaker armor to give him a lift towards Ellis, much to Rhodes' annoyance.

Rhodes attempting to rescue Matthew Ellis
However, the Heartbreak armor was soon taken down by an Extremis Soldier and Rhodes was thrown off, landing on a walkway. As more soldiers ran towards him, Rhodes was protected by Striker, who had launched them into the air before Tank blasted them out of the sky, allowing Rhodes to keep moving. With the Iron Legion still protecting him, Rhodes eventually found the captured President Ellis, promising that he was on his way while more soldiers surrounded Rhodes.

Rhodes attempting to shoot at the soldiers
Landing onto a hanging container, Rhodes was followed by the two Extremis Soldiers, as he drew his weapon and fired several bullets in their faces and chest. However, Rhodes watched in horror as the soldiers used their Extremis powers to instantly heal before they then continued stepping towards him. When one of the soldiers dislodged the container, Rhodes was thrown off and barely able to hold on, as the two soldiers looked down at him, preparing to kill Rhodes.

Rhodes manages to get Matthew Ellis free
However, Rhodes simply shot out the container's other support wire, causing it to swing free and the soldiers to be thrown off. Rhodes then swung through the air and landed onto President Ellis.  As the falling container exploded and caused a massive fireball, Rhodes used the Iron Patriot's repulsor to then destroy one of the chains holding him in place, and they swung away from the incoming flames before Rhodes landed and shot off the other wire, finally freeing Ellis.

Iron Patriot rescues President Matthew Ellis
With Ellis now safe, Rhodes then complimented him on how good he looked in the Iron Patriot Armor, before then insisting that he needed to get it back. Rhodes got his armor back and then used it to fly himself and President Ellis back into Washington, D.C. and out of danger zone. Stark then confirmed that he was staying behind in order to continue his fight with Aldrich Killian, aiming to stop all his schemes and the remaining soldiers while also rescuing Potts.

Conflict Aftermath
Rhodes watches on as Rodriguez is arrested
While Iron Patriot ensured that President Matthew Ellis was safe from any other danger, Tony Stark eventually defeated Aldrich Killian and the rest of his Extremis Soldiers with the aid of Pepper Potts, who had gained powers from Extremis. With their conflict over, Rhodes further aided his government by then outing Vice President Rodriguez as Killian's conspirator and watched as he was arrested by the FBI inside the White House.

Rhodes and Pepper Potts support Tony Stark
Rhodes attended Stark's surgery to have his Arc Reactor taken out, alongside Potts, giving Stark a thumbs up for support before he went under. Doctor Wu then successfully removed the remains of the shrapnel. Rhodes later repainted his armor back to its original color scheme and returned to using the alias War Machine, as he went on missions for the United States Armed Forces. One such adventure had War Machine capturing a tank and delivering it to a General's home.

Ultron Offensive
Party at Avengers Tower
Rhodes attending the Avengers' victory party
Having continued to take part in several missions as War Machine for the United States Armed Forces, Rhodes was later invited to attend a party at the Avengers Tower alongside the Avengers to celebrate the Avengers' recent victories over HYDRA and the capture of Baron Wolfgang von Strucker. During the celebration, Rhodes enthusiastically told the story of how he had found and then delivered an entire tank to a general, but he was quickly disappointed when Thor and Tony Stark were both unimpressed by the tale of his heroic adventures, as Rhodes had then complained that other people were always impressed by his recent War Machine stories.

Rhodes having a chat with Natasha Romanoff
Rhodes had then asked why Pepper Potts and Jane Foster were not also attending the party with them, although Rhodes had then swiftly walked away alongside Maria Hill had then walked away when Stark and Thor began arguing about who has the better girlfriend, as Stark had continued to compare Potts' recent work with Stark Industries to Foster's discoveries with the Convergence. During the party, Rhodes had found Natasha Romanoff and spent some time talking with her.

Rhodes retelling his own War Machine stories
Frustrated by his friend's lack of interest with his adventures, Rhodes decided to distance himself from the Avengers and spend his time at the party with other non-powered guests in an attempt to feel better after being mocked by Thor and Stark. Rhodes told that same story about wearing his Mark II and flying the tank to a general's office to a group of beautiful women and was then satisfied when they had all seemed to be impressed by the story and laughed at the punchline.

Rhodes and Tony Stark attempt to lift Mjølnir
As the party had begun to reach its conclusion and most of the other guests had departed, Rhodes stayed behind with Stark playing cards with Hill and watched as the Avengers challenged each other to try to lift Thor's hammer Mjølnir. After watching Clint Barton be the first to fail to even move Mjølnir, Rhodes had joined in Stark's unsuccessful attempt, despite using the gauntlets from their War Machine and Iron Man armors, as Rhodes had still demanded Stark pull harder.

Rhodes watches the other Avengers failing
The other Avengers had also tried, including Steve Rogers and Bruce Banner, but in the end it everybody had failed, as Rhodes smiled with Stark and Barton who continued to try and come up with their own theories over how the hammer could be lifted, refusing to accept that it was an Asgardian enchantment, however it still seemed that only Thor was capable of lifting the hammer and then claimed they were simply all unworthy, much to Rhodes and the other's great annoyance.

Attack on Avengers Tower
Rhodes watches on as Ultron reveals its form
As the group had continued their celebrations, they were interrupted when a loud screech was heard throughout the Avengers Tower. As Rhodes and the others turned to see what it was, they found that a scrapped Iron Legion suit had begun calling itself Ultron awakened from Tony Stark's laboratory and began talking about saving their world. Rhodes and the others were immediately suspicious before Ultron claimed that his plan was to cause the Avengers' extinction.

Rhodes attempting to shoot at Ultron's drones
Ultron had then furiously attacked the Avengers by launching several of the Iron Legion robots at them, while Steve Rogers kicked over the table as his defense before then being thrown backward by one of the robots. Reacting immediately, Rhodes helped his allies as he was Stark leaped down into the fight, but before Rhodes could even fire a shot, he was then thrown out of a window, but he was able to survive thanks to the bridge on the floored part of the tower below him.

Avengers Argument
Rhodes and the others discuss Ultron's plans
Following the defeat of Ultron first attack against them, the team had discussed the events and what Ultron's plans could be, with Rhodes also making his disapproval of the situation clear to the Avengers, noting that Ultron could be targeting the nuclear codes. As it was revealed that Ultron had managed to destroy J.A.R.V.I.S., Rhodes then witnessed Thor attack Tony Stark in retaliation for the situation.

Rhodes questions the threat that Ultron poses
 While Thor confirmed that Ultron had taken Loki's Scepter, Stark had then revealed that he and Bruce Banner had originally created Ultron as their means to protect the world from an upcoming war that they were doomed to lose. When Stark had commented on his previous experiences during the Battle of New York, Rhodes then sarcastically claimed that all these were not events that Stark had ever mentioned before, as Stark continued defending his and Banner's actions.

Rhodes giving Natasha Romanoff his updates
As the situation with Ultron continued unfolding, Rhodes was sent to the Pentagon to try and calm things down, as the Armed Forces were aware that other countries were also dealing with Ultron's continued attempts to gain their nuclear codes. Rhodes had contacted Natasha Romanoff and then explained that War Machine was being sent into the Middle East for peace talks, while Stark had promised to upgrade his Mark II armor to ensure that Ultron could not hack into it.

Battle of Sokovia
War Machine furiously destroys Ultron's army
When Nick Fury called together their former S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel to assist the Avengers with the conflict against Ultron, Rhodes was sent in with them, utilizing the Mark II to defend the Helicarrier and assist with evacuating all the civilians from the elevated Novi Grad. Charging in the fight, War Machine began shooting the Ultron Sentries out of the sky, commenting that this would make for a good story.

War Machine flies into the battle with Iron Man
War Machine was joined in the sky by Iron Man, who questioned if he would be able to hold his own in their battle alongside the Avengers, before making his awkward comments, before War Machine and Iron Man joined forces to continue shooting Ultron's army out of the sky. As Fury's team used their Lifeboats to rescue the civilians, Ultron tried to take them out, as War Machine then tore these Sentries apart while Iron Man had then ensured they did not fall to their deaths.

War Machine tears another Ultron Sentry apart
As Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch had joined in the fight alongside the Avengers, they were soon able to push back Ultron's army and even came close to destroying Ultron. With Ultron clearly losing the fight, his remaining Sentries attempted to flee, so War Machine was called to stop them, however, Vision flew by War Machine and assisted him in destroying all these Ultron Sentries with the Mind Stone, while War Machine was surprised to receive help from an unknown ally.

New Avengers
Joining the Team
War Machine at the New Avengers Facility
Once the Ultron Offensive had finally been concluded, War Machine officially joined the Avengers' roster, acting as a liaison between them and the American government. He arrived at the New Avengers Facility and began their training under the leadership of Captain America and Black Widow. War Machine did not, however, participate in the mission to defeat Crossbones in Lagos, Nigeria along with Vision, since that mission had required more stealth tactics.

Sokovia Accords
Rhodes joining the Avengers for their meeting
In the aftermath of the Avengers' disastrous mission which had taken place in Lagos, Nigeria, where the Avengers fought against Crossbones, which had ended as Crossbones set off a bomb, causing the deaths of citizens when Scarlet Witch had redirected the explosion into a building filled with innocent people. Following this, Rhodes and the Avengers were called into a meeting to discuss this incident.

Rhodes listening to Thaddeus Ross' speech
Sitting with the Avengers, Rhodes listened while Thaddeus Ross had explained that, following the high civilian death tolls connected to the Avengers' missions in New York City and Sokovia while they fought against Loki and Ultron, it had been decided that they needed to be put under a lot closer checks. Ross had then presented Rhodes with their recently created Sokovia Accords, which Ross explained meant that the United Nations would have control over the Avengers.

Rhodes and Sam Wilson discuss the Accords
Once Ross had left the New Avengers Facility, Rhodes and the other Avengers began discussing the Accords and whether they should be accepted, while Rhodes spoke with Sam Wilson, arguing that Ross' military record should give him more credibility. While Wilson argued that there was a risk they would be sent to the Raft if they disobeyed the Accords, to which Rhodes then noted that with the support of the hundred and seventeen countries, the Accords should be obeyed.

Rhodes listening to the Avengers' arguments
Their debate was interrupted by Vision who then made the point that following Tony Stark announcing that he was Iron Man, the number of enhanced individuals and world threatening events had skyrocketed, claiming that the Avengers' presence would always invite challenge and conflict. As Rhodes agreed with Vision, Natasha Romanoff then invited Stark to make his own case, as Stark told them about Charlie Spencer, who was killed in Sokovia while they had fought Ultron.

Rhodes and Steve Rogers having their debate
Rhodes listened closely while Stark had claimed that his example of Spencer proved why the Avengers needed to be put in check, which Rhodes agreed with. However, Steve Rogers instead claimed that the Accords shifted the blame and they should all take responsibility and continue the fight. Rhodes disagreed, calling Rogers' points arrogant and also noted that the decision was not being made by the World Security Council or HYDRA, although Rogers insisted that the United Nations was run by people with agendas which could change, which could put innocent people in danger if they had ever decided that the Avengers would not be allowed to go out on certain missions.

Rhodes makes his decision on the Accords
While Stark and Rogers engaged in their own debate over the morals of the Accords, Rhodes had listened while Stark noted that when he learned what Stark Industries' weaponry was doing in the hands of the Ten Rings, he had shut down that operation, to which Rogers had noted that Stark chose to do that, which the Accords would not have allowed. While the Avengers chose their side with the debate, Rogers learned that Peggy Carter had passed away and left the room.

Arresting Captain America
War Machine arrives to arrest Captain America
When Joint Counter Terrorist Centre successfully managed to locate the Winter Soldier in his hiding place within Bucharest, Rhodes, in his newly upgraded Mark III armor, was then called in to aid GSG 9. Arriving just as the GSG 9 held Captain America, Winter Soldier, Black Panther and Falcon at gunpoint, War Machine landed with his weapons loaded and aimed at his former Avengers allies as they surrendered.

War Machine personally greets Black Panther
While Captain America had managed to convince the Winter Soldier not to fight back and handed over his Shield to them, War Machine told him that as he had disobeyed the Sokovia Accords, he was now a criminal. While taking them into their custody with his weapons still trained on them, War Machine was also shocked to discover that the Black Panther was King T'Challa of Wakanda, as he showed respect to the Wakandan king who had tried to kill the Winter Soldier.

Clash of the Avengers
War Machine and Iron Man confront Rogers
However, before long the Winter Soldier had been broken free from the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre Building, having just gotten the assistance of both Captain America and Falcon who helped him go into hiding. Upon hearing of their escape, Iron Man called in War Machine and other allies in order to stop Captain America and his teammates from escaping, as War Machine and Iron Man had blocked Captain America in an airport.

War Machine watching over Captain America
While the two armored heroes blocked Captain America's way, they were also joined by Black Panther and Black Widow, while Captain America attempted to explain that Helmut Zemo was in fact behind everything that was happening. Frustrated by the situation, Iron Man called in Spider-Man, who stole Captain America's Shield to disarm him while Iron Man tried to convince him to surrender now, insisting that if he did not, their situation would become more dangerous.

War Machine ready to battle Captain America
However, it soon became clear that Captain America did not plan to surrender as Hawkeye freed him from Spider-Man's Webbing before his shield was stolen back by Ant-Man. As War Machine had tried to understand what was happening, they spotted Falcon and the Winter Soldier in one of the terminals, only for Captain America to throw his shield at War Machine before he then tackled Black Panther in order to keep them both from attempting to target the Winter Soldier.

War Machine being taken down to the ground
While Captain America was still fighting against Black Panther, War Machine drew a Stun Staff from his Mark III armor, commenting that it would not kill Captain America but would not tickle either, however, Captain America was still able to block the strike with his shield. As War Machine attempted another strike, Captain America was able to knock him out of the air, causing him to crash land which also broke the staff, much to War Machine's annoyance and he discarded it.

As War Machine had prepared to continue his fight against Captain America, he witnessed Ant-Man returning to the fight. War Machine then witnessed Captain America and Ant-Man using one of the Pym Particles Disks to force an entire truck at the group. Although all the others managed to dodge out of the way, War Machine was hit with the full force of the exploding truck, although his War Machine Armor had protected him despite this greatly angering him regardless.

Before Captain America's team could all reach the Quinjet and make their escape, their path was blocked by Vision who fired his beam of energy from the Mind Stone. War Machine had then regrouped with his own team, flying Black Panther to the line up as the two sides of the Avengers faced each other down. When it had become clear that Captain America would not surrender despite the situation, their two teams began to run towards each other to continue their fight.

Once the fight had begun, War Machine targeted Falcon, as they flew above the Leipzig-Halle Airport and tried to knock each other out of the sky. War Machine and Iron Man focused on trying to take out Falcon, while also taking some shots at Hawkeye, as they continued flying over the airport. However, as War Machine also caught Falcon, suddenly Ant-Man transformed into Giant-Man and then caught War Machine in mid-air, much to his complete and utter surprise.

Giant-Man then proceeded to toss War Machine aside, while Spider-Man swung in and had caught him with his webbing, launching War Machine back into the fight, while Giant-Man had continued to cause chaos throughout the battlefield. War Machine and Spider-Man then teamed up to target Giant-Man, as War Machine fired his weaponry which had no effect, before War Machine launched Spider-Man onto his arm, as he used all that momentum to land a heavy kick.

Using whatever weaponry he had, War Machine attempted to take down Giant-Man with his Sonic Cannon, only for Giant-Man to punch him across the airport. Once he recovered, War Machine witnessed Giant-Man grabbing an entire walkway and swinging it towards him, as War Machine unloaded every weapon on his armor to destroy it before it could hit him, before then managing to dodge out of the way of Giant-Man's continued attacks as he then flew all around him.

War Machine's efforts to take down Giant-Man were then interrupted by a series of attacks from Wanda Maximoff, who threw multiple cars at War Machine. During this, their team realized that Captain America and the Winter Soldier had almost reached the Quinjet. Vision attempted to block their path, only for Maximoff to keep it clear. Seeing all of this happening, War Machine used his Sonic Cannon to incapacitate Maximoff, causing her to scream in complete agony.

Despite these efforts, they were unable to stop Captain America and Winter Soldier from reaching the Quinjet. War Machine and Iron Man had then continued focusing their own efforts on attempting to bring down Giant-Man, until finally, Spider-Man had an idea to defeat him, taking inspiration from The Empire Strikes Back. Understanding the plan, War Machine watched as Spider-Man tied up Giant-Man's legs before War Machine and Iron Man then punched him on the jaw and caused him to fall down and crash land hard onto the ground.

War Machine trying to catch Captain America
With little time remaining, War Machine and Iron Man had then begun chasing down the Quinjet as Captain America and the Winter Soldier had attempted to get away. During this chase, War Machine became aware that he was being followed before Falcon had begun firing all of his own weaponry from his EXO-7 Falcon to try and prevent both War Machine and Iron Man from managing to catch up to the Quinjet, as War Machine had called out to his allies for their assistance.

However, when Vision had attempted to assist War Machine by firing a blast of energy from the Mind Stone at Falcon's wing suit, he was too distracted by caring for Scarlet Witch and missed his shot. That blast then completed destroyed War Machine's Arc Reactor, causing his Mark III armor to shut down as he plummeted towards to ground below, while Iron Man and Falcon had both desperately attempted to catch up to War Machine before he crashed land onto the ground.

Despite the efforts of Iron Man and Falcon, they were not fast enough to save War Machine before he crash landed on the ground, causing unrepairable damage to his spine. As he landed beside him, Iron Man tore off War Machine's helmet, before F.R.I.D.A.Y. confirmed he was still alive. With this, the fight concluded as the remaining members of Captain America's team were sent to the Raft by Thaddeus Ross and War Machine was taken to a medical center for medical attention for all his injuries.

Injury Recovery
Rhodes learning that he has been paralyzed
Following his grave impact during the Clash of the Avengers, Rhodes was then taken straight back to New York City where he was treated at the Columbia University Medical Center, under the close watch of both Tony Stark and Vision, who had felt great personal guilt for his part with Rhodes' injuries. Having undergone several tests, Rhodes had then learned that due to the impact, he had been paralyzed from the waist down.

Rhodes' recovery being helped by Tony Stark
Having been returned to the New Avengers Facility, Rhodes had then continued his recovery, with the assistance from Stark who had built him leg braces that could help him walk again, but Rhodes had problems adapting to it. Sitting on the floor, Rhodes then noted how he had done a hundred and thirty eight combat missions while in the Air Force because he had thought this was the right thing to do, same as the Sokovia Accords which he had still supported.

Rhodes and Tony Stark greet the Delivery Man
While Stark had helped Rhodes get back to his feet so that he could continue practicing to walk again, they were then interrupted by the unexpected arrival of a Delivery Man who mistakenly misread Stark's name as "Tony Stank," much to Rhodes' amusement, who claimed he would never forget that nickname. Rhodes then carefully walked away, while commenting about all the different ways that he planned to use the name Stank to annoy his friend in the years to come.

Reuniting the Avengers
Rhodes discusses Vision's disappearance
Rhodes spent the better part of two years recovering from his injuries and adapting to the leg braces that enabled him to walk. During this time, Rhodes gradually became embittered towards the Sokovia Accords, as well as Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, despite having signed them himself over the damage done to the Avengers and the latter's bullheaded perception of Steve Rogers as a criminal.

Rhodes speaking to Secretary Thaddeus Ross
Ross contacted Rhodes at their New Avengers Facility to discuss the recent disappearance of Vision, who had last been seen when both he and Wanda Maximoff were being attacked in Edinburgh and leaving in the company of the fugitive Avengers. Rhodes had insisted that his former team mates were only being branded as criminals due to the orders of Ross himself, and argued that if it was not for the Accords being created, Vision would have been with them in the Facility.

Rhodes reveals his betrayal of Thaddeus Ross
Although Ross reminded Rhodes of how he had signed the Accords himself, Rhodes claimed that he had paid the price for that decision, indicating to his leg braces. Just as Rhodes had insisted that he no longer had second thoughts about these decisions, they were then interrupted by the arrival of Rogers, who had arrived there onboard the stolen Quinjet along with the wounded Vision, as well as all of the other fugitive Avengers, much to the complete shock of Ross.

Rhodes being reunited with Captain America
While Ross and Rogers discussed the situation following the arrival of the Black Order and the disappearance of Tony Stark, Ross then ordered Rhodes to arrest them all immediately. Instead, Rhodes cut off the call with Ross, accepting that this would be a court marshal offense and would immediately cost him his Air Force career. Despite that, Rhodes happily reunited with his friends, jokingly commenting that they looked like crap, to which Sam Wilson noted that they had not been staying in five-star hotels during those previous two years. The group was then greeted by Bruce Banner, who revealed that he had returned, much to Natasha Romanoff's considerable surprise, as Wilson had then jokingly commented on the awkward situation.

Rhodes discusses the Black Order's return
Following their reunion, Rhodes and all the other Avengers discussed what was to be done about the Mind Stone, as they had learned from Banner that it was being sought by the Mad Titan Thanos in his quest to gather all the Infinity Stones and then cause the Snap. Looking at the footage of the Black Order, Rhodes commented that clearly they would soon be returning and would then be able to track them down, therefore they needed to get somewhere safe to protect Vision.

Rhodes agreeing to destroy the Mind Stone
To the surprise of Rhodes and everyone else, Vision suggested that they instead destroy the Mind Stone, indicating that Maximoff could do it due to her similar powers. Having agreed to do it if they could ensure Vision survived, Rhodes had pushed the group to find somewhere they could achieve this goal, to which Rogers suggested they visited T'Challa in Wakanda. The group agreed and traveled to destroy the stone before Thanos could ever get his hands on it.
