<html><p>Rogers questioned Thor's motives as he explained that he had seen a vision which had shown him that the Mind Stone on Vision's forehead was one of the six Infinity Stones, which they would need to defeat Ultron. Vision promised to assist the Avengers in their war with Ultron and, in an attempt to show its worthiness to the Avengers, as Rogers and the others had continued to question it, Vision calmly lifted Mjølnir and handed it to Thor, proving his worthiness. This sight left Rogers greatly surprised as he watches Thor congratulate Stark.

Rogers agrees to go to war against Ultron
The Avengers then teamed up with the Maximoff twins and regained their weapons ready to go to war with Ultron. They discovered that Ultron was heading back to Sokovia with a plan to destroy the world and was holding Black Widow there as well. Rogers gathered with Stark and Banner to discuss their plan of attack, Stark noted that it was unlikely that they would all survive the battle but Rogers did not let this stop him, jokingly noting that he had no other plans.

Rogers giving his speech to the Avengers
As they flew to Sokovia in the Quinjet, Rogers gave a speech where he informed the Avengers that the priority was to get the people of Sokovia away from the harm before engaging Ultron. Rogers detailed the plan to evacuate the city, rescue Romanoff, discover what Ultron was building with the vibranium taken from Ulysses Klaue and then engage Ultron himself. Rogers concluded that this was their chance to prove they were not monsters as Ultron believed they were.

Battle of Sokovia
Evacuating the Citizens
Captain America arriving within Sokovia
As the Avengers arrived in Sokovia, Rogers attached his shield and grabbed his helmet. He walked down to see some graffiti of him with the word 'Fascist' written on it. In disgust, Rogers threw his helmet back on the Quinjet. Rogers was then informed by Wanda Maximoff that the bridge was the main way out and Quicksilver said that they would cover the others so Rogers told them to get everybody out while they still could. As Rogers prepared to go and evacuate the civilians, Clint Barton walked by and noticed the graffiti, while jokingly saying it was not bad.

Captain America destroying an Ultron Sentry
When he was confronted by Iron Man, Ultron had then responded by unleashing his army of Ultron Sentries across Sokovia, ordering them to slaughter all the innocent people in order to ensure he was not bothered while he continued with his schemes. Captain America led the Avengers in their battle against the armies of Sentries, as Maximoff offered protective shield while Rogers continued to fight them back, managing to rip the arm off one of the Ultron Sentries.

Captain America watches while Sokovia rises
Eventually, Ultron made his move towards complete destruction and used a device which was powered by Ulysses Klaue's vibranium, to levitate Novi Grad as Ultron had then prepared to drop the entire city down onto the Earth to destroy the entire planet. Captain America watched this unfolding from the bridge, seeing buildings falling apart as the citizens ran in terror, all while Ultron watched from the air and vowed that before long only he would remain on the planet.

Captain America giving the Avengers orders
While they continued trying to get as many people out of harm's way as they could, Iron Man warned Captain America of an incoming. However, he informed him just a moment too late as another Sentry crashed into Rogers and sent him flying backward. Getting back to his feet, Captain America ordered Tony Stark to focus on bringing the city back down safely, while ordering the team to tear the Sentries apart, telling them to walk off any injury, even their own death.

Captain America and Thor save the citizens
As the army of machines continued to attack the civilians of the city, Rogers spotted two cars which were dangling from the edge of the broken bridge. Captain America attempted to save at least one, but was seconds too late as both of the cars fell from a bridge, tumbling hundreds of feet. Thor came to their aid and flew down, pulling the woman out of her car and throwing her to Rogers, who was able to pull her back to safety. Another Sentry then attempted to kill them, but Rogers was able to use his shield to rip it in half before he had thrown its mangled body off the bridge, mocking it as it fell while Thor successfully brought the second car back onto the bridge.

Captain America and Thor destroying Sentries
While Hawkeye joined forces with Maximoff and Quicksilver while they battled the Ultron Sentries in the city center, Captain America and Thor fought the incoming army inside the outer limits of the city, protecting the citizens from danger, with Captain America allowing Thor to use Mjølnir to strike his shield with considerably more power. While Ultron personally confronted Thor, Hawkeye claimed that they were all clear, which Rogers disputed as he destroyed Sentries.

Captain America joining up with Black Widow
When Black Widow had arrived on the battlefield, she found herself surrounded by Ultron's forces until Captain America came to her aid. Together, Romanoff and Rogers fought side by side, assisting each other in their fight as Rogers then threw her his own shield which she used along with her Batons to fight back against the Sentries which surrounded her. Rogers joined the fight until the first wave of Sentries were all destroyed, giving the Avengers a moment of peace.

Reinforcements
Rogers and Romanoff discuss an escape plan
During this time, Iron Man flew outside of Novi Grad to try and work out a solution in order to stop Ultron's plans for global annihilation, when he suggested that they destroy the city while it was still in the air, Rogers insisted that they would not leave the city and risk the lives of the thousands of citizens. Standing on the edge of the city, Black Widow had argued that the percentages of these sacrifices did not match up.

Captain America sees the arriving Helicarrier
While they continued debating the matter, they were then interrupted when eventually, Nick Fury and Maria Hill had unexpectedly arrived on board a Helicarrier. While Rogers looked on with amazement, Fury explained that he gained the old and supposedly Helicarrier with the help of some old friends. Rogers, surprised yet delighted over Fury's surprise arrival, jokingly called him a son of a bitch, to which Fury teased if Rogers spoke to his own mother the same way.

Rogers evacuates all the people of Sokovia
With the assistance of Cameron Klein who was also on board, Fury then used the Helicarrier to enact Rogers' plan and evacuate all the civilians while War Machine joined the battle to keep the Helicarrier from harm. Fury sent out a squad of rescue boats to evacuate the citizens while Rogers and all the Avengers ensured no one was left behind, ensuring that every civilian got to the safety of the Helicarrier before the entire city could then be dropped out of the sky.

Protecting the Key
Captain America stands with the Avengers
Seeing the Avengers were winning the battle, Ultron had attempted to activate the key, dropping Novi Grad out of the sky and destroying the entire planet as a result. Captain America and the rest of the team arrived inside the church and surrounded the key in order to protect it. Once everybody had finally reassembled around the key, Iron Man explained to Black Widow that if Ultron was able to get near the key, the day would be lost. Just as this was said, Captain America noticed Ultron was currently assembling his armies just outside.

Captain America and Thor preparing to fight
When Thor had mocked Ultron by questioning if all this was the best he could do, the robot responded by showing off his army of hundreds of Ultron Sentries. Captain America then turned to Thor and commented on how he had to provoke Ultron resulting in such a difficult challenge for them. As Ultron continued to monologue about how he intended to destroy them, Iron Man said they would defeat him the way Captain America had once suggested; together.

Rogers battles the army of Ultron Sentries
With the challenge accepted, Ultron immediately unleashed his entire army of the Ultron Sentries upon them, who completely surrounded the church within seconds. Captain America and all the Avengers put all their force into destroying the seemingly endless horde of Ultron Sentries: However, even Captain America soon found himself being overwhelmed as one of the Sentries grabbed ahold of his throat until he was able to free himself and ripped off the Sentries head.

Captain America fighting with the Avengers
As the onslaught of Sentries continued to attack them, the Avengers fought as a perfect unit, with Captain America crushing the Sentries under his shield while Vision used his incredible abilities to give them a clear advantage against Ultron's forces, until finally, they were pushed back. When Ultron attempted to join the fight in his strongest form, Vision alongside Iron Man and Thor nearly destroyed him as well as his vibranium armor with their own combined powers.

Captain America gives orders to the Avengers
With the battle almost won, Captain America then ordered the team to get to a Rescue Boat and leave the city before Iron Man and Thor stayed behind and destroyed the city, despite knowing that there was a strong chance of their deaths. When Hawkeye questioned how the key would be protected, Wanda Maximoff had agreed to stay behind to protect it, despite Quicksilver being unsure of the idea. With little time to spare, Rogers and the others made their way to safety.

Destruction of Sokovia
Rogers speaks to Thor during the battle
With only limited time remaining to get the final few civilians off Novi Grad and onto the Helicarrier, Captain America regrouped with Thor to ensure that everybody was safe, including most of the Avengers who were no longer needed in the mission. While they were speaking, Iron Man requested that Thor return to the church so, together, they could destroy the entire city by overloading and then striking the vibranium core once everybody was clear from danger.

Rogers witnesses the death of Quicksilver
However, before they left, Ultron had managed to successfully take control of their Quinjet and used it to fire a hail of bullets upon the Avengers. While Captain America was able to block the bullets using his shield, Ultron was, however, successful in killing Quicksilver in the process, who was attempting to protect Hawkeye by sacrificing his life. Rogers quietly carried Pietro's body onto the rescue boat while Hawkeye saved a young boy and reunited him with his sister.

Rogers ensuring Sokovia has been evacuated
While Ultron was ripped from their Quinjet by Hulk to ensure he could not do any more damage, he was thrown back down into the streets of Novi Grad, with his robotic body disabled. There, Ultron was later confronted by the Wanda Maximoff, who attempted to avenge her brother by destroying Ultron's primary body. Meanwhile, Rogers remained on the surface of the city and watched the final few people get on the Lifeboats ready to get away from the danger.

Rogers watches Novi Grad fall towards Earth
Without warning, Ultron took advantage of Maximoff leaving her post and managed to activate the key and Rogers was barely able to escape onto the Lifeboats as Novi Grad fell towards the Earth at a terrifying speed. Thor and Iron Man were able to destroy the device, saving the Earth from Ultron's devastating plan. With the battle won, Vision was able to destroy the final Ultron body, effectively killing him and ending the threat of global destruction for the world.

New Avengers
Leading the Team
Rogers speaking with Thor and Tony Stark
The Avengers were soon disbanded in the aftermath of the Battle of Sokovia, with Tony Stark and Clint Barton retiring and Bruce Banner still missing in action. Rogers, Stark and Thor met at the New Avengers Facility where they discussed Vision keeping the Mind Stone in his head, Thor insisted that he could as he had proven himself worthy by lifting Mjølnir, although Rogers questioned if this counted as Vision was a machine, comparing him to putting Mjølnir into a lift which would still go up.

Captain America says goodbye to Tony Stark
Thor then returned to Asgard to learn more about the Infinity Stones, as he had been given a vision of their true power while within the Water of Sights, claiming that someone was planning on using their power for something terrible soon. Stark then departed the facility, telling Rogers that he believed it was time for him to return to Stark Industries and Pepper Potts away from the Avengers, with Rogers telling Stark that he would miss him once he was gone.

Captain America recruiting Black Widow
Rogers then explored the New Avengers Facility, which had been formed by Nick Fury, with the help of Maria Hill, Erik Selvig, Helen Cho and other former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to train a new Avengers team. Before long, Rogers found Natasha Romanoff in one of the hallways having just spoken with Fury and considering where Banner might have gone. Rogers teased Romanoff before calling her into action and asking her about their new team of Avengers.

Captain America training the new Avengers
Captain America then greeted the New Avengers team, consisting of Vision, Wanda Maximoff, War Machine and Falcon. Before long, HYDRA collected many of the parts of the destroyed Ultron Sentries and took them to an undisclosed location in Eastern Europe, where they used the parts to create a giant robot called Ultimo. HYDRA then used the Ultimo to attack a village. Rogers led the Avengers to an attack on the giant robot and managed to destroy Ultimo.

Attack on the IFID Headquarters
Captain America leads the Avengers in Lagos
Rogers led his fellow Avengers on a mission in Lagos, Nigeria to stop Brock Rumlow - now a freelance mercenary who had since separated from HYDRA. Rogers observed the streets from a building when he saw a suspicious garbage truck. Rogers had Falcon follow the truck using Redwing. Discovering the truck was at maximum capacity with an armed driver, Black Widow realized that the vehicle was being used as a battering ram. 

Rogers fights all Crossbones' mercenaries
The truck then drove into the IFID entrance, allowing all Crossbones' mercenaries to break in. The Avengers attacked the mercenaries as Falcon dropped Rogers from the sky where he proceeded to take out some of Crossbones' mercenaries. Falcon soon located which floor Crossbones was, so Rogers was thrown into it by Wanda Maximoff who emptied the building of gas. Rogers fought through all Crossbones' mercenaries to discover that he had taken a biological weapon.

Captain America is shot at by Crossbones
Rogers reached the balcony when Crossbones attacked him from an armed vehicle after having already subdued Black Widow. Despite Rogers attempting to get away, Crossbones still continued to fire at him, destroying much of the building before knocking him out of a window when Rogers was hit by a fireball. While Rogers recovered from the fall, Crossbones and his mercenaries managed to escape to the market and the Avengers quickly chased after them all.

Captain America is attacked by Crossbones
Before long all of Crossbones' mercenaries had been found and defeated, with Black Widow recovering the biological weapon and sending it away within Redwing, however, Crossbones himself still remained at large. Once Captain America had arrived on the scene, Crossbones managed to attach a bomb to his shield. To save himself and the citizens around him, Rogers threw his shield away before it exploded, only to be attacked from behind by Crossbones.

Captain America fights against Crossbones
Captain America and Crossbones then battled one another, with Crossbones desperate for revenge for what had happened to him during the Battle at the Triskelion in which Rogers had crashed a Helicarrier into the Triskelion and nearly killed him. Crossbones used the upgrades on his Battle Suit to try and kill Rogers, including using retractable blades, but Captain America's superior fighting skills and enhanced strength gave him the edge in the fight.

Captain America confronts Brock Rumlow
As their fight went on, Captain America managed to rip off both of Crossbones' gauntlets and then eventually beat him into submission. Having finally defeated Rumlow and removed his enemy's mask, Rogers interrogated him about his plans, demanding to know who he was planning on selling the biological weapon to. Unintimidated by the threats, Rumlow proceeded to taunt Rogers about how HYDRA had tortured and brainwashed Bucky Barnes under the orders of Alexander Pierce, which managed to distract Rogers from the threats around him. With Rogers thrown off by thoughts of Barnes, Rumlow then triggered his suicide vest to kill both himself and Rogers to finally gain his revenge.

Captain America sees Wanda Maximoff's mistake
Before Rogers could be consumed in the fireball, he was saved just in time as Maximoff used her powers to protect Rogers and all the immediate civilians by containing the explosion and throwing Rumlow into the air, where he exploded. As a result, however, dozens of the innocent people inside a nearby building were killed by the blast, as Rogers and Maximoff looked on in horror. Upon seeing the carnage, Rogers instructed Wilson to call fire and rescue onto the scene.

Avengers Civil War
Sokovia Accords
Rogers listens to Thaddeus Ross
A month after the event, Wanda Maximoff still felt guilty over the death of the civilians. Rogers tried to comfort her by admitting he was also at fault for freezing up when Brock Rumlow mentioned Bucky Barnes. He reminded Maximoff that sometimes, they could not save everyone despite their best efforts, but more innocents might die if the Avengers aren't there. Vision then entered the room and informed Rogers that Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross had arrived at the New Avengers Facility. The new Avengers members and Tony Stark were present, as Ross explained to them that as a result of many catastrophic events in which the Avengers had been involved in over the years, the United States planned to sign the Sokovia Accords alongside countless other nations, regulating superheroes and subjecting the Avengers' actions to the approval of a United Nations panel.

Rogers debating over the Sokovia Accords
The Avengers were divided on the issue, with each member beginning to take sides. Stark fully supported the bill, feeling the regulation was necessary to do good and protect people, making an example of a young man who had died in Sokovia while he was helping the poor. Stark tried to convince Rogers, but the latter was hesitant. Rogers felt that the Avengers were successful because they did not have a government to which they answered; deliberation of when to deploy the team would render the Avengers too slow to act in emergencies and prevent them from determining when and where to act when people need help the most.

Rogers mourns the loss of Peggy Carter
While Stark felt guilty over creating Ultron, Rogers felt that the intervention of another party could have similar results to the S.H.I.E.L.D. infiltration by HYDRA. Ross informed the team that refused to sign the Accords was tantamount to resignation. During the meeting, Rogers received a text telling him that Peggy Carter had passed away peacefully in her sleep, much to his heartbreak.

Death of Peggy Carter
Rogers attending Peggy Carter's funeral
At the funeral in London, Rogers' beliefs on the Sokovia Accords were affirmed by a eulogy given by Sharon Carter, who revealed her relation to the former Carter; she was Peggy's niece. Rogers stayed in the church after the funeral, alone, acknowledging that another friend was deceased. Natasha Romanoff arrived and consoled with Rogers. They discussed the Accords, and what it would mean for Rogers in the team. Romanoff felt it was necessary to sign, but Rogers was unmoved.

Rogers speaking with Sharon Carter
Rogers and Carter were in Vienna where the Sokovia Accords were underway to be signed. Rogers talked to Carter about her work when she was spying on him and later spoke about any of this to Peggy to which she denied. Rogers spoke about Carter's work at the CIA being stationed in London, but she said that she will be in Berlin for joining the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre. Upon arriving in an elevator with Carter, Rogers was suddenly informed by Sam Wilson that a bomb was detonated outside the Vienna International Centre. They watched the news reporting that the prime suspect was Bucky Barnes.

Hunt for Winter Soldier
Rogers and Natasha Romanoff discuss Barnes
Rogers called Natasha Romanoff and asked her if she was alright. After she said she was fine, she urged him not to go after Barnes. He refused, saying that he was the most capable to confront him and he hung up. Rogers and Sam Wilson met in a nearby bar, and Wilson asked him if Romanoff had told him to not interfere. Rogers said that Barnes would have done the same thing. Sharon Carter then entered, giving Barnes' location in Romania and a warning to Rogers that the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre had given the order to kill Barnes on sight.

Rogers locates Bucky Barnes in his apartment
Against the warnings of Romanoff, Rogers and Wilson went to Romania. Rogers entered Barnes' apartment and saw Barnes. While Wilson updated him about GSG 9 soldiers approaching their location, Rogers asked Barnes if he remembered him. Barnes said he did since he had read about him at the Smithsonian Institution. Rogers warned him about the task force coming for him, as they thought Barnes had caused the Bombing of the Vienna International Centre, but Barnes assured him that he had not done it. Rogers asked Barnes why he had pulled him out of the river during the Battle at the Triskelion, but Barnes said he did not know why, although Rogers thought otherwise.

Rogers fighting GSG 9 agents
Once the GSG 9 operatives broke into the apartment, Rogers and Barnes fought against them together. The two escaped, but Barnes was attacked by Black Panther. As the two fought each other, a GSG 9 helicopter shot towards them, and Rogers asked Wilson to deflect it. Barnes escaped through a tunnel, with Black Panther and GSG 9 operatives after him, and Rogers went after Barnes to defend him. 

Rogers and Barnes are apprehended
The pursuit continued, Rogers running after Black Panther. Because he was so fast, Rogers entered one of the GSG 9 cars. Black Panther held onto the car and Rogers could not get rid of him, asking Wilson to help him. Barnes threw a bomb to the tunnel's entrance and Black Panther managed to catch him. Rogers got out from the spinning car, only to be arrested by the GSG 9 operatives and War Machine, who called him a criminal. Black Panther revealed himself to be T'Challa, the prince of Wakanda.

Fugitive of the Law
Rogers being introduced to Everett Ross
The four were brought to the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre Building in Berlin. During the transition, Rogers asked T'Challa if his Panther Habit was made of vibranium as it had proven to be bulletproof. He replied that he took the title of the Black Panther after his father had died in the Bombing of the Vienna International Centre. Barnes was held in a containment cell and Rogers, Sam Wilson, and T'Challa met with Everett Ross, the deputy task force commander. He told them their equipment, meaning the EXO-7 Falcon and Captain America's shield, had been confiscated for the foreseeable future.

Rogers having his debate with Tony Stark
They were offered exoneration on the condition they sign the Sokovia Accords, but Rogers and Wilson refused to sign. Tony Stark arrived, extending an olive branch by offering Rogers a set of antique fountain pens, and asking his friend once more to sign. Rogers almost agreed, but he felt he must stand by his principles. They argued, including the house arrest Stark had ordered Vision to do for Wanda Maximoff in the New Avengers Facility. Rogers still refused to sign the Accords.

Winter Soldier's Escape Attempt
Rogers furiously confronting Helmut Zemo
Rogers and Wilson, with Sharon Carter, watched the interview of a contained Barnes by the psycho-analyst, Theo Broussard. Rogers suspected the motive behind releasing Barnes' picture to the public. Carter realized that he thought someone had framed Barnes only to get him; Rogers suspected the psycho-analyst. Suddenly, the power across the headquarters went out. Rogers and Wilson hurried to the interrogation room, finding the psychoanalyst on the ground without Barnes. Rogers asked him who was he and what he wanted, so he replied he wanted to see "an empire fall."

Rogers pulls back Bucky Barnes' helicopter
Barnes suddenly attacked Rogers and Wilson, easily subduing Wilson and engaging in a brief scuffle with Rogers, using his Prosthetic Arm to throw him down an elevator shaft. Rogers went after him, finding him on a helicopter. With his strength, Rogers managed to hold the helicopter to the landing platform and prevent the escape. Barnes fell to the river and Rogers pulled him out.

Learning of Winter Soldiers
Rogers speaks with Bucky Barnes
The duo had then taken Bucky Barnes to an abandoned building and subdued him by placing his Prosthetic Arm into a vice. They questioned him if he was still under brainwashing of the psychoanalyst, who was really Helmut Zemo and deliberated their course of action; telling Tony Stark or the others would get them back where they started, but doing otherwise could make them wanted men. Barnes elaborates the potential motives of Zemo. He believed that Zemo was traveling to the HYDRA Siberian Facility that had kept him when he was in HYDRA. He suspected he would use the Winter Soldiers, highly trained HYDRA assassins, for his goals. Rogers said to Sam Wilson that they were alone in the fight, but Wilson said that he knew a guy who could assist them.

New Team
Rogers is given his shield by Sharon Carter
Knowing the threat an army of Winter Soldiers posed to the world, Rogers, Sam Wilson, and Bucky Barnes weighed their options. They decided they must put a team together to stop Helmut Zemo and to resist Tony Stark and his team. He connected with Clint Barton, asked him to free Wanda Maximoff from the New Avengers Facility and then to recruit Scott Lang.

Rogers assembles his team
Rogers met with Sharon Carter in a parking lot, with her returning his shield and Falcon's wings that she had stolen. The pair then shared a kiss as Barnes and Wilson smiled in approval, much to Rogers'  great embarrassment. After she left, Barton arrived with Maximoff and Lang, who was eager to meet Captain America and the other heroes and agreed with their plight, even though Rogers informed him that he would once again be a criminal. They planned to take a Quinjet at the Leipzig-Halle Airport and use it to get to Zemo, although they knew Stark and his team would wait for them. Rogers told his team to suit up.

Clash of the Avengers
Captain America facing Iron Man's team
Captain America and his companions arrived at the Leipzig-Halle Airport to take a Quinjet and find Helmut Zemo. Rogers went to the field alone, where he was intercepted by Iron Man and his Avengers, who offered Rogers and his team one last chance to surrender. Rogers tried to convince Stark that Zemo was behind their fight, but he did not listen. Suddenly, Spider-Man showed up, using his Web-Shooters to take Rogers' shield and to tie his hands. Falcon found the Quinjet, so Hawkeye freed Rogers and Ant-Man brought his shield back. The two teams then fought each other.

Captain America fights against Black Panther
Rogers fought against War Machine and Black Panther. As T'Challa ran to Bucky Barnes, Rogers stopped him. Ant-Man came to him, telling him to throw the shrunken truck at the Pym Particles Disks. Once he did that, the truck grew and exploded. Captain America's team reunited and ran to the Quinjet, but Vision arrived and blocked their way with his energy blast. As both teams were facing each other, Falcon asked Rogers what should they do next, so he replied they would fight.

Captain America leading his Avengers team
Captain America and his team ran to Iron Man's team and the two fought each other. Captain America managed to bring Spider-Man to the ground and he told him that he did not understand what was happening. They fought each other and Captain America dropped a platform on him, forcing him to hold it. Rogers asked him from where he came, so Spider-Man replied that he was from Queens. Rogers smiled and said he was from Brooklyn. Rogers and Barnes reunited and ran to the Quinjet. Ant-Man had a plan to distract the other team, so he grew in size. As they ran to the hangar, Vision used his energy blast to collapse it, but Wanda Maximoff used her power and prevented it. 

Captain America manages to escape the fight
The two entered the hangar; however, they were intercepted thereby Black Widow. Rogers did not want to fight against her. To Rogers and Barnes' surprise, she let them leave, repeatedly shocking Black Panther, who was about to stop them, to keep him in place, giving the two the chance to reach the Quinjet. As they departed, Iron Man and War Machine followed them through the air as they attempted to fly away. In turn, Falcon followed the two armored Avengers to try to stop them. But only after the two changed directions, Rogers and Barnes had an opportunity to leave.

Battle at the HYDRA Siberian Facility
Rogers and Barnes explore the HYDRA facility
On their way to the HYDRA Siberian Facility, Bucky Barnes said to Rogers that he felt he was not worthy enough so Rogers would lose his friends. Rogers said to him that what Barnes had done over the years was not his fault. The two entered the facility, a few hours after Helmut Zemo.

Rogers and Barnes are found by Iron Man
As they searched for Zemo, Tony Stark arrived at the facility and declared a truce to stop Zemo. The trio found the Winter Soldiers, all deceased. Zemo revealed himself behind a bunker and explained that he successfully managed to bring him and Stark to the base, after a year of planning. Rogers realized that he was from Sokovia and wanted revenge because of the battle there.

Captain America confronts Helmut Zemo
Blaming the Avengers for the loss of his family during the battle, he had orchestrated a plot to tear them apart from the inside. He then started a video of a car on a dark road which Stark instantly recognized. The three watched it, as it revealed Barnes, under HYDRA's control, killing Howard and Maria. Stark then moved to attack Barnes before Rogers held him back. Stark then demanded Rogers to tell him if he had known that Barnes had killed his parents.

Rogers reveals the truth to Tony Stark
Rogers revealed that he had known Stark's parents were killed by HYDRA, but didn't know it was Barnes. However, Stark saw right through the lie and demanded the truth, forcing Rogers to admit that he had known about Barnes killing his parents for a few years. Already enraged by Rogers' decisions over the past few days, Stark snaps and attacked Barnes with the intent to kill him. He forced Rogers into clamps before the super soldier broke free with his shield as Stark and Barnes had destroyed the base's main floor. As the Mark XLVI was pinned under debris, Rogers told Barnes to flee and he attempted to reason with Stark that Barnes had no control over his actions. When Stark refused to listen, Rogers was forced to damage one of the suit's boot jets before Stark trapped him with the laser.

Rogers defends Bucky Barnes from Iron Man
Rogers caught up in the fight, managing to reflect a lethal repulsor blast back at Stark before being separated from his shield and trapped on a lower level. When Stark tried to crush Barnes under the Mark XLVI's weight, Rogers tackled the Avenger taking the two down to the main level. Rogers again attempted to reason with Stark which falls on deaf ears again, overpowering the super soldier before Barnes intervened with the shield, turning the fight into a two on one brawl. Stark responded to the uneven odds by simply blasting Rogers point blank, disabling him for nearly two minutes.

Captain America battles against Iron Man
Barnes managed to force Stark against the wall and tried to rip out the main Arc Reactor. Stark responded with the Unibeam, disintegrating Barnes' metal arm before knocking him aside with a standard blast. Recovering, Rogers stormed towards Stark, deflecting the repulsor blasts with his shield before forcing Stark back against the wall and pummeling him relentlessly.

Rogers tries to justify his actions
Knowing he stood no chance up close, Stark changed his tactics, anticipating Rogers' moves and caught the shield before blasting it away and brutally beating down the captain. Utterly defeated, outclassed by the Mark XLVI, and having lost everything, Rogers tried to appeal to Stark to make him understand why he did what he did before Stark bitterly commented that they were enemies now and threw him aside, giving him a final warning to stand down.

Rogers refuses to stand down
Bloodied and exhausted, Rogers still refused to stand down, even as Stark charged a repulsor blast. Barnes, who was still alive, managed to grab Stark's boot before Stark kicked Barnes in the face. This provided a distraction for Rogers, who grabbed Stark from behind and violently slammed him into the ground. Rogers pinned him to the floor and pummeled him with every bit of remaining strength he had, smashing his helmet to pieces and shattering his Arc Reactor with his shield.

Rogers surrenders his shield to Tony Stark
As Rogers carried the injured Barnes away, Stark claimed that Rogers did not deserve the shield, as Howard Stark had made it. Acknowledging that he had proved himself unworthy of the weapon, the title as Captain America and out of sympathy for his former friend, he reluctantly surrendered it back to the Stark family and left the scene with Barnes. Once outside the facility, Rogers and Barnes were confronted by the Black Panther, who revealed that he had overheard everything and had already apprehended Zemo. Before leaving to take Zemo to the authorities, Black Panther told Barnes that he had resources in Wakanda that could help him in removing his Winter Soldier programming.

The Nomad
Escape from the Raft
Rogers frees all of his Avengers members
Two days later, after finishing his plan on how to infiltrate the underwater prison, Rogers took a Quinjet to the Raft and liberated his teammates, who had been confined there following the airport battle. Rogers then went on the run with Sam Wilson and Wanda Maximoff, while Clint Barton and Scott Lang returned to their homes.

At the same time, seeking to make amends, Rogers sent Tony Stark a package containing a letter and a cell phone. In the letter, Rogers apologized for the events that had transpired, specifically withholding the knowledge of Stark's parents' murder and the fact that they couldn't agree on the Sokovia Accords. He assured Stark that if the latter would ever need him, he would be a phone call away.

Wakanda
Rogers watches Bucky Barnes getting frozen
Some weeks after the Escape from the Raft, Rogers and Barnes were told by T'Challa that Bucky Barnes would have to return to cryo-sleep stasis to have a better chance of having his Winter Soldier programming removed. Though Rogers disagreed, he left the choice to Barnes, who decided to give it a chance. After Shuri explained how she intended to remove the HYDRA programming, Rogers stayed by Barnes' side as he went into the ice once again.

Rogers speaking with T'Challa in Wakanda
Rogers thanked T'Challa for his actions in protecting Barnes, with T'Challa noting that both Barnes and T'Chaka were victims and he wanted to help one find some kind of peace. Rogers warned him that if the United Nations would discover that Wakanda was harboring the Winter Soldier, they will come as Thaddeus Ross and Everett Ross were still furious that he had gotten away, to which T'Challa boldly stated that they may try.

Infiltrating Terrorists
After Shuri successfully freed Barnes from HYDRA programming, and he was allowed to settle on a Wakandan farm, Rogers occasionally visited his friend to check his recovery. After months of remaining under the radar, thanks to their ties with S.H.I.E.L.D., Rogers and Wilson were later joined by Natasha Romanoff, who was now on the run for helping Rogers during the Clash of the Avengers.

Romanoff used her KGB contacts to track down a terrorist organization supplied with Chitauri fueled weapons in Syria. Infiltrating the terrorists, Rogers, Wilson and Romanoff disabled the weapons and then left for Lebanon. While retaking Chitauri technology from terrorists, Rogers, Romanoff and Wilson were met with by Nick Fury, who tried to get Rogers to contact Stark to work through their falling out.

Infinity War
Saving Vision
Rogers shows up to help Vision
Steve Rogers, who had been called by Bruce Banner, located Vision's area, alongside Natasha Romanoff and Sam Wilson. Rogers stepped into the light as Vision and Wanda Maximoff looked hopeful and relieved. While all parties are distracted, Sam Wilson swooped in and kicked Proxima Midnight across the platform and through the closed café's security gate and furniture.

Rogers battles against Proxima Midnight
In a coordinated attack, the three rogue Avengers engaged the Black Order, attacking together and even using their own weapons against them. With Wilson knocking Midnight away, Romanoff managed to use Midnight's spear to severely injure Corvus Glaive, while Rogers retrieved Glaive's weapon.
