<html><p>After their failed experiment, Stark arrived at the facility having figured a way to perform time travel successfully. He then agreed to help them, and they began to get the Avengers back together. Romanoff went to Tokyo in search of her best friend, Barton, having discovered that is where he was. She made her way to Barton's location, to be confronted with him ruthlessly murdering Yakuza boss Akihiko.

Romanoff reunites with Clint Barton
When Barton became aware of her presence, he told her that she should not be there, to which she replied neither should he. Barton told Romanoff he had a job to do, but she told him that it wouldn't bring his family back. She then revealed their plan to bring everyone back, but he told her to not give him hope, something he had lost which Romanoff wished she could have given him sooner. She then held his hand to comfort him and the two returned to the facility.

Time Heist
Creating a Plan
Romanoff checking on Clint Barton
With all the Avengers assembled once again, they began to work on creating the machine as Scott Lang prepared to test it. They finished the machine, but Clint Barton ended up being the one to test it, as Lang was not ready. They all watched as Barton stood on the machine and then went into the Quantum Realm. A few seconds later, he was brought back, and Romanoff checked up on him. After telling her he was fine, he showed her a baseball glove he retrieved, revealing that their experiment had worked.

Romanoff and Rocket Raccoon listen to Thor
With the means of transportation achieved, the team then began to discuss the Infinity Stones' history. They started with the Aether, watching on as Thor told them about it, but started to get off-topic due to him not being in control of his emotions. They then moved onto the Orb, which Rocket Raccoon informed them was on Morag when Peter Quill stole it in 2014. Nebula then told them about the Soul Stone, which Thanos retrieved on Vormir by sacrificing her sister.

Romanoff brainstorm the Time Heist
Romanoff, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner then discussed the Time Stone, which they told her Doctor Strange had, and he lived in New York. Romanoff then realized that in 2012, there were three stones in New York: the Time Stone, the Space Stone and the Mind Stone. With this point being brought up, they were then able to complete their brainstorm for the Time Heist and plan out who was going where.

The Avengers complete the Time Heist
It was later decided amongst the members of the Avengers that Romanoff and Barton would go to Vormir in 2014 to obtain the Soul Stone, along with James Rhodes and Nebula, who were going to Morag to retrieve the Power Stone, Stark, Steve Rogers, Banner and Lang were going to New York in 2012 to retrieve the Space, Mind, and Time Stones, and Thor and Rocket were going to Asgard in 2013 to steal the Reality Stone.

Retrieving the Soul Stone
Black Widow and Hawkeye prepare to leave
The Avengers all then suited up in their Advanced Tech Suits and made their way to the platform, where Captain America gave them a speech about everything that had led up to that moment and how this was their only opportunity to change what had happened. Bruce Banner then activated the machine, as Black Widow told them she would see them in a minute, and they all were transported to the Quantum Realm, where they each traveled to their designated time.

Black Widow and Hawkeye leave Morag
Black Widow, Hawkeye, War Machine and Nebula all successfully arrived in 2014 on Morag, where they enlarged the Benatar and waited for Nebula to lower the space pod. On the desolate planet, Black Widow was seen kicking an Orloni creature who approached her. Hawkeye then asked them to hurry up as their time was limited. Black Widow and Hawkeye then boarded the Benatar and said goodbye to War Machine, who asked them to watch over each other.

Black Widow and Hawkeye travel to Vormir
They then departed Morag and headed to Vormir, to retrieve the Soul Stone, using the coordinates Nebula provided them on the ship. As they traveled to Vormir, the two best friends enjoyed the sight of space travel, laughing with each other, as Hawkeye mentioned that they had gone through so much since being S.H.I.E.L.D. agents years ago, mentioning their mission in Budapest, to which she agreed with. While the ship was on autopilot, the two had a deep conversation about their relationship.

Black Widow and Hawkeye arriving at Vormir
They soon arrived at the planet, which amazed Hawkeye, saying that what they were doing would be awesome if not for the circumstances. They then made their way through the planet, climbing up the mountain, which they found to be exhausting. Black Widow pointed out the physical effort of their mission by stating that Rocket, who she referred to as a raccoon, wouldn't have had to climb a mountain, which Hawkeye stated that technically he was not a raccoon, but she didn't care. When they made it to the top of the mountain, they were greeted by the Red Skull who alarmed them, causing them to draw their weapons at him.

Black Widow draws her weapon at Red Skull
Schmidt, who had revealed Black Widow's father's name and Hawkeye's mother's name, informed them that he was a guide for those seeking the Soul Stone, so Black Widow demanded that he show them where it was. However, he informed them that it is never that simple. They learned that the stone was at the bottom of the cliff and that they had to make a sacrifice of what they love for the Soul Stone.

Self-Sacrifice
Black Widow decides to sacrifice herself
Upon learning about the price to pay for the Soul Stone, Black Widow and Hawkeye took a moment to let the severity of the situation sink in. Black Widow sat down as she contemplated doing "whatever it takes" to retrieve the stone, while Hawkeye voiced his disbelief.

Black Widow discusses the Soul Stone
Black Widow then remembered how Nebula told them that Thanos killed Gamora on Vormir, meaning the sacrifice was legitimate. They then repeated what Captain America had said before their mission, "whatever it takes," before accepting that one of them needed to sacrifice themselves for the stone. Hawkeye decided that he would make the sacrifice, holding Black Widow's hand to comfort her in their final moments. 

Black Widow tries to convince Hawkeye
However, Black Widow then reciprocated the same gesture, making him realize that she intended on sacrificing herself. They then argued over which one it should be, neither wanting to willingly let the other die. Black Widow attempted to make her case, stating this is what she had been working towards all these years since the Snap occurred, and that she did not want Hawkeye to die. She also noted that if they did nothing, all victims of the Snap would stay dead.

Black Widow and Hawkeye embrace
However, Hawkeye told her he should do it, as he saw himself as too far gone, to which Black Widow assured him that he is more than his worst moments. However, when Hawkeye told her that she should not try and give him a chance, Black Widow responded that he gave her a second chance when they first met on his kill mission. She also proclaimed that she did not judge people based upon their worst mistakes in life.

Black Widow briefly subdues Hawkeye
The two then took a moment to embrace each other's friendship, resting their heads on one another, until Hawkeye caught Romanoff off-guard and threw her down so he could sacrifice himself. He told her to tell his family, when they were brought back, that he loved them. However, Black Widow gained the upper hand and threw him down, deciding to make the sacrifice herself. She then shot Hawkeye with her bite, causing him to get electrocuted. She responded to Hawkeye with "You tell them yourself."

Black Widow tells Hawkeye to let her go
As she made a run for the cliff, Hawkeye ripped off the taser disk, drew his bow, and fired an explosive arrow near Black Widow, causing her to be thrown to the side, away from the edge. He then rushed towards the cliff and jumped off, but Black Widow also jumped and grabbed Hawkeye, shooting a grapple and attaching it to him so he wouldn't fall, before trying to sacrifice herself. However, Hawkeye was able to grab onto Black Widow's arm, but could not pull her up without both of them falling.

Black Widow sacrifices herself
Hawkeye got mad at her for stopping him from jumping. Black Widow asked Hawkeye to let her go, assuring him it was okay and knowing that there was no other way, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. Hawkeye desperately tried to change her mind, as he did not want his best friend to die. However, Black Widow felt the exact same and forced him to let her go by kicking off and jumping off the cliff wall. Black Widow then fell to her death as a devastated Hawkeye watched, helpless to do anything else. With the sacrifice being made, Hawkeye then obtained the Soul Stone.

Legacy
Remembered by Friends
The Avengers then returned to 2023, having successfully obtained the Infinity Stones. When Clint Barton returned, he silently fell to his knees when asked about Romanoff by Bruce Banner. The others then deduced that she had sacrificed herself for the Soul Stone, causing their initial celebration to perish. The original Avengers all gathered outside to mourn the loss of their friend, with Tony Stark asking if Romanoff had any family they had to inform. Steve Rogers retorted that they were her family, something she had told him earlier.

When Thor questioned why they were acting like Romanoff was dead, believing that they could bring her back with the Infinity Stones, Barton told them that it could not be undone. He then became angry over the death of his best friend, remarking that it should have been him who died instead. Banner came to terms with her death and declared that Romanoff's sacrifice would not be for nothing. The team then began constructing a Nano Gauntlet to control and contain the Infinity Stones.

Banner used the Gauntlet to reverse the Snap, successfully restoring the lives of the individuals who perished five years ago, though Romanoff could not be revived despite Banner's hopes. After Stark's funeral, Barton spoke to Wanda Maximoff at the Stark Eco-Compound, wished there was a way for him to let Romanoff know that they were successful and her sacrifice meant something. Maximoff comforted him by assuring that Romanoff knew, as well as Vision.

Although her body was irretrievably lost in another timeline, she was given a tombstone in a graveyard in Ohio. Romanoff's adoptive sister Yelena Belova would constantly visit the grave to pay her respects, reorganizing the flowers that had been placed there. During one visit, she was approached by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, who paid her respects to Romanoff before informing Belova that Clint Barton was the man responsible for Romanoff's death, and offered Belova the chance to eliminate him to exact vengeance.

Personality
The entirety of Romanoff's character was hard to distinguish based on how she tricked and lied to people for a living. She was capable of convincingly portraying friendly and flirtatious, timid, vulnerable, and scared. For the most part, she was a level-headed, strong-willed, and independent woman. Romanoff normally maintained a controlled, almost emotionless persona to keep whatever she was thinking a secret unless she was around people she absolutely trusts. Although she was more than willing to rush into deadly battle and other unnerving missions for S.H.I.E.L.D., she was not completely fearless, as she was visibly frightened of Hulk. However, she was no longer afraid of him due to falling in love with Bruce Banner.

Though a very serious agent, Romanoff was by no means stuffy and has a sarcastic sense of humor, which mostly surfaces when she was with Captain America or Hawkeye, both of whom she was comfortable around. Romanoff was very smart and loyal which was displayed when she made good on the debts she owed Barton and Rogers (saving the former from Loki's mind control and trying to protect the latter during a highway assault). While tough and at times ruthless, she was still a good person and can be quite heroic in her own right. These qualities are usually brought out by her other Avengers, mainly her missions with Steve Rogers. And no matter how injured she was in battle, Romanoff will go out her way to make sure bystanders are out of harm's way (keeping several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents away when Banner was transforming into Hulk, helping Hawkeye evacuate civilians when the Chitauri attacked Manhattan, and risking her life to make sure innocent people weren't shot by the Winter Soldier when he was chasing her). Her close loyalty to both Rogers and Barton was shown in the Avengers Civil War, as she was willing to aid their faction despite being forced to go on the run from the United Nations afterward. As a result of her childhood, she considered the Avengers her family, being desperate to keep them together when the Sokovia Accords were due to be signed and was affected when Tony Stark denounced her as a friend and made it clear he would not help her in the future. She was further shocked and saddened when Barton following the loss of his family became more ruthless and violent when she encountered him in Tokyo.

Romanoff was also very close with Clint Barton's family, especially with his and Laura Barton's only daughter, Lila, being the only member of Avengers who knew of their existence. Romanoff was genuinely affectionate with the child, hugging her the moment they reunited and sweetly commended the little girl on the drawing she made. They originally named their youngest child after Romanoff before them discovering that it was, in fact, a boy, thus naming him Nathaniel instead, with Romanoff humorously referring to the unborn child as a "traitor." This was further proven in Vormir where she refused to let Clint sacrifice himself, knowing how much he meant to his family and vice-versa, and sacrificed herself instead because she believed she had less to lose.

Romanoff was sterilized as a rite-of-passage for her graduation from the training she underwent in the Red Room under the supervision of Madame B. This event deeply affected her, as she regretfully told Banner of the so-called advantages of the procedure.

Despite her lifestyle of espionage and operating within the shadows, Romanoff's adaptability influenced her opinions on the Sokovia Accords. Realizing the difference between S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers with many of their activities seen in the light of day amongst the public, Romanoff wanted to appease public opinions by signing and also that she didn't want conflict with her close friends and teammates like Barton and Rogers. This care for Captain America eventually caused Romanoff to betray Stark's team and assist their escape so they could clear Barnes' name, eventually becoming a fugitive because of this.

Despite her harsh and traumatic upbringing, Romanoff retained a kind, caring and compassionate side of her, with Melina Vostokoff expressing surprise at how she was able to keep her heart after all she had been through. For years, she harbored deep resentment and guilt towards herself due to the damage she had caused during her time in the Red Room and S.H.I.E.L.D, and spend most of her life attempting to make up for her actions. This was most evident when she freed Taskmaster from Dreykov's control, and tearfully apologized to her adoptive sister Yelena Belova for not coming back for her.

Abilities
Natasha Romanoff was one of the most talented spies and lethal assassins in the world. She was said by her instructor Madame B. to be the best student in the Red Room, never failing a single test. Both the KGB and S.H.I.E.L.D. considered her as one of their most dangerous operatives. Romanoff was highly skilled in martial arts, armed combat, espionage, infiltration, disguise, manipulation, evasion, hacking, and assassination. Romanoff's extraordinary skill-set made her a core member of the Avengers. Romanoff also displayed impressive endurance and durability, being able to withstand being shot in the shoulder by Winter Soldier, being hit and flung away by Hulk, being launched into a car by a powerful kick from Taskmaster, falling from a building and hitting several metal structures on the way down, and taking many blows from several Widows, all of which failed to render her so much as unconscious.

Black Widow swiftly taking down mercenaries
Master Martial Artist: Romanoff was one of the most dangerous and best fighters in the world, with supremely skilled in hand-to-hand combats and martial arts, having been trained from a young age in the Red Room and S.H.I.E.L.D. in her later life as a top operative. During her time in the Red Room, she was seen using her martial arts to defeat a grown man by swinging his head into the corner of a desk, proving how formidable she was even when she was young. She was extremely skilled in the field of martial arts, having mastered arts such as sambo, hapkido, Lucha libre-style wrestling, Krav Maga, multiple styles of kung fu, wing chun, Taekwondo, and kali with her batons. Romanoff has efficiently taken down many enemies, such as a squadron of armed soldiers after being ambushed in a hotel room, multiple Hammer Industries security guards, Georges Batroc's armed pirates, several members of STRIKE, Chitauri aliens, Ultron Sentries, and Outriders. She was skilled enough to be able to defeat a mind-controlled Hawkeye, maintain the upper hand against Ant-Man, and even hold her own against the much stronger Winter Soldier, though he was able to bring her down in the end. Black Widow also managed to compete with Proxima Midnight alongside Okoye, even managing to disarm her with her baton, holding her off long enough for Wanda to kill her. In addition, she had enough skill to stab Corvus Glaive using Proxima Midnight's Spear. Romanoff was able to hold her own against many Widows at once, fight the similarly trained Yelena Belova to a standstill, and managed to engage Taskmaster in combat for a prolonged period of time, though Taskmaster had the upper hand throughout the fight.
Spear Mastery: Romanoff shows great skill in the use of a spear in close combat, she was seen wielding a Chitauri staff to battle the Chitauri. She was also skillful enough to use Proxima Midnight's spear to almost kill Corvus Glaive.
Staff Mastery: As a Black Widow, Romanoff possessed tremendous skill in using a staff, demonstrating her prowess during the Battle of Wakanda to fight against Proxima Midnight. Romanoff also combined her batons into a staff to battle Proxima Midnight, using it to defend and attack simultaneously.
Knife Mastery: As a Black Widow, Romanoff was highly skilled in using a knife. This has shown during her skirmish with Taskmaster, Romanoff wielded a knife against her with great skill.
Shield Proficiency: Romanoff was skilled in wielding a shield in battle. She was able to briefly using Captain America's shield to defend and attack an Ultron Sentry before throwing it back to Rogers. During her fight with Taskmaster, Romanoff was able to use Taskmaster's shield to block her attacks.
Master Marksman:      Romanoff was a talented marksman at a young age   Romanoff was a very accurate marksman who was skilled in sharpshooting. During the Battle of Washington, D.C., Romanoff would have shot the Winter Soldier through his eye if he had not been wearing his protective goggles. She had also been trained from a young age in the art of sharpshooting, as she was seen practicing on targets, making several headshots in quick succession.
Romanoff was a talented marksman at a young age
Master Acrobat: Romanoff was an extremely skilled gymnast, acrobat, and aerialist, often incorporating gymnastics and acrobatics into her fighting style as she fought opponents. She had shown numerous complex maneuvers and feats throughout her battles. During her fight within Hammer Industries Headquarters, Romanoff used these skills to defeat the guards with ease. During the Chitauri Invasion, she got to ride a Chitauri Chariot by using her acrobatics to commandeer it.
Master Spy: Romanoff was a dangerous secret agent highly skilled in espionage, stealth, disguise, infiltration, and demolitions. Her talents and years of experience have enabled her to reach a high ranking as a special agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Romanoff is well versed in internal destabilization and was soon deemed a threat to global security because of this. In addition, She was an expert in the field of seduction, often resorted to seducing men to obtain her goals while working undercover, such as when she posed as an assistant to evaluate Tony Stark for the Avengers Initiative. Romanoff was also able to bend many men to her will and sometimes even get them to do her bidding for her, and would continue deceiving them through different means necessary if she still had a further use for them. Moreover, she displayed an uncanny affinity for psychological manipulation and could mask her real emotions perfectly. Romanoff's skills were so legendary that Nick Fury created a Lie Detector that he hoped she could not deceive. Her incredible talents for deception also enabled her to detect when others were lying, such as when she was able to discern that Captain America was lying to her about not knowing why Nick Fury was at his apartment. Councilwoman Hawley even stated that she was unaware Romanoff was Russian due to her complete lack of an accent, stating she sounded perfectly American.
Master Assassin: Romanoff was notorious in the art of assassination, considered to be one of the most dangerous assassins in the world. She was known to have killed many people during her time serving the KGB and S.H.I.E.L.D. During her time in the Red Room, Romanoff was trained to kill without remorse and was seen demonstrating her sharpshooting skills on a live captive, showing no emotion as she killed him.
Gifted Intellect: Romanoff's intellect seemingly put her on par with Steve Rogers and Clint Barton. She possessed the ability to quickly process multiple information streams like threat assessments and rapidly respond to changing tactical situations. Romanoff also possessed a vast knowledge of human anatomy, displayed by her often using joint locks and hitting enemies in the weakest parts of their bodies; for example the crotch, stomach, armpits, and the head. Her prodigious skill from her years of training also allows her to predict her opponents' plans of attack as well, such as when she was able to save herself, Captain America, and Falcon from being shot by the Winter Soldier by predicting the order in which he would shoot at them through the roof of their car. Victoria Hand has even stated that Romanoff does not usually require extraction teams on S.H.I.E.L.D. missions and is resourceful enough to make her own escape.
Expert Tactician: Romanoff was a very effective strategist, tactician, and field commander. She had shown to lead the Avengers and even S.H.I.E.L.D. on one occasion. Romanoff was able to trick Ross and his entire S.W.A.T. team thinking that they had tracked her down to a train station in Albany using the tracker on her suit, but she already knew and deliberately left them there in order to lure them to the wrong place and thus buying herself more time to go to her hiding place. Moreover, Romanoff, in conjunction with Yelena Belova constructed a plan to successfully break Red Guardian out of prison. She later collaborated with Melina Vostokoff to construct a plan to bring down the Red Room and kill General Dreykov in a short amount of time before Red Room soldiers arrived.
Master Interrogator: Romanoff was able to trick Loki into telling her about his plan to use Hulk against the Helicarrier to bust him out of his cell. She was able to do a "reverse interrogation"; while she seemed to be in danger, in truth, she was getting all the information she wanted to know. Romanoff utilized this technique once again to goad Dreykov into revealing the key needed to access his console.
Expert Hacker: Romanoff could hack into most computer systems without tripping any firewalls or security. She used this talent to hack into Hammer Industries mainframe and help James Rhodes regain control of the War Machine Armor and enabled him to help Stark fight the rest of the attacking Hammer drones, and again to access the location of Camp Lehigh from the USB Steve Rogers received from Nick Fury.
Pilot: Romanoff was a skilled pilot, capable of piloting a Quinjet by herself with ease, and was able to copilot a helicopter along with Yelena Belova.
Multilingualism: Romanoff was fluent in Russian, English, French, German, Chinese, Italian, Vietnamese, Latin, Norwegian, Japanese and various other languages. Romanoff also knew Morse code, which enabled her to send a message to Clint Barton when she was captured by Ultron after the Battle of Seoul. She also taught Wanda Maximoff an American accent to cover up her Sokovian accent.
Equipment
Weapons
Black Widow electrocuting Black Panther
Black Widow's Bite: Electroshock weapon that can deliver powerful electrical discharges from two bracelets worn by Romanoff. When the Chitauri forces invaded Earth during the Battle of New York, she used the Widow's Bite to electrocute several enemy troops by jamming her charged fists into them. Romanoff used the Widow's Bite to take out a pirate guarding the Lemurian Star ship's engine room. Romanoff acquired a more powerful version of the Black Widow's Bite from Tony Stark, which causes the piping in her suit to light up and glow. She made use of her bite during the Avengers Civil War. She zapped Ant-Man with her bite, sending her miniaturized opponent flying away, and later used the bite to cover the escape of Captain America and the Winter Soldier by using taser disks fired from her bite to hold off Black Panther.
Romanoff fighting against the Ultron Sentries
Black Widow's Batons: Electroshock weapons that can deliver powerful electrical shocks to incapacitate her targets. Romanoff used the batons to take down dozens of Ultron Sentries with a combination of her weapons and martial arts mastery and later employed these weapons during the Avengers Civil War, although not charged with electricity. She once again utilized her batons to battle the Black Order and the Outriders and was able to combine them to form a staff; she kept these batons in a holster worn on her back.
Taser Disks: Romanoff used two taser disks aimed at the feet of one of the security guards at Hammer Industries Headquarters, paralyzing his legs to temporarily disable him.
Garrote:  Romanoff stored a garrote within her Bite, which she utilized to aid in her escape from a nightclub in Moscow by using it to strangle and then throw an opponent over a railing and down a stairwell. Romanoff then employed it again while infiltrating Hammer Industries Headquarters, using it to deflect the blows of one of the security guards at Hammer Industries Headquarters, and later to strangle him until he lost consciousness. During an attempted ambush on the Winter Soldier, Romanoff jumped onto his shoulder from behind and attempted to strangle him with her garrote, only to be thrown off.
Makarov PM: Romanoff disarmed a Russian soldier of his sidearm in Cuba and theatened to kill anyone for touching her surrogate sister, but she relinquished it to her surrogate father. During her training with the Red Room, Romanoff trained with this gun, shooting it in quick succession while alternating her shooting arm, and being forced to use it against living targets.
Walther PPK/S: Romanoff's original weapon of choice. She carried it when she went to stop Ivan Vanko at Hammer Industries Headquarters, but chose not to use it against the security guards inside the complex.
Heckler & Koch USP Compact: Romanoff took a Heckler & Koch USP Compact from one of the guards at Hammer Industries Headquarters. She dual-wielded it along with her Walther PPK/S when she stormed inside the room where Ivan Vanko was supposed to be, only to find it empty.
Black Widow aiming with her twin handguns
Glock 26: Romanoff replaced the Walther PPK/S for a pair of Glock 26 handguns, continuing to use them for the rest of her life as her weapon of choice. She had one of them concealed in the abandoned house in India where she staged a meeting with Bruce Banner, and then used both her firearms shortly after to fight the Chitauri army during the Battle of New York. Romanoff continued to use them during her missions with S.H.I.E.L.D., killing some of Georges Batroc's pirates during a mission to rescue the Lemurian Star, and later during a shootout against the Winter Soldier in Washington, D.C., managing to shoot and damage his goggles and forcing the Soldier to remove them. During the Battle of Sokovia, Romanoff resorted to the use of her handguns to shoot point-blank some of the Ultron Sentries. She still carried them during the Clash of the Avengers, but she kept them holstered so as not to harm her former allies. When she reunited with her sister in Budapest, she disarmed the latter of her pistol. Romanoff took them with her when she traveled to Vormir to retrieve the Soul Stone, drawing them upon hearing the Red Skull welcoming her and Hawkeye to the planet.
Glock 19: The Glock 19 pistol is the standard sidearm carried by STRIKE. Romanoff was able to obtain one of them when she posed as Councilwoman Hawley inside the Triskelion, using it to threaten Alexander Pierce. She also retrieved one of these guns hidden beneath the bar of Avengers Tower to shoot at the Iron Legion drones hijacked by Ultron. She used it to great effect, shooting one Iron Legion drone in the head while running up the stairs with Bruce Banner for cover, and continued to fire at another before Steve Rogers destroyed it with his shield.
Romanoff takes aim at Crossbones' men
Glock 17: Romanoff managed to obtain this gun from one of the mercenaries working for Crossbones who attacked the Institute for Infectious Diseases in Lagos. When Romanoff grabbed the gun, one of the mercenaries threatened to release the biological weapon they had just stolen. She used it to quickly kill one of the mercenaries while Redwing killed the other, managing to secure the biological weapon.
Heckler & Koch P30: Romanoff carried a new pistol when she traveled to Budapest, but she was disarmed by her sister.
Colt M4A1 with a M203 Grenade Launcher: A fully automatic carbine and the standard weapon used by S.H.I.E.L.D. STRIKE Team members, outfitted with a grenade launcher. Romanoff took the weapon that the Winter Soldier had been using and shot a grenade at him, forcing him to make his escape before he could kill Steve Rogers in Washington, D.C.
Black Widow using the Chitauri Staff in battle
Chitauri Staff: Romanoff took one of the staves used by the Chitauri army when they invaded New York City and effectively used it against them as both a ranged and melee weapon.
Scepter: Romanoff used Loki's scepter to shut down the Tesseract portal device as Erik Selvig instructed.
Proxima Midnight's Spear: Romanoff used this during the Attack on Vision against Corvus Glaive.
Taskmaster's Shield: To be added

It is a white, red, and black suit that materializes around the wearer's regular clothes when time travel is required and disappears when no longer in use. It has size-shifting adaptability down to subatomic levels and a wrist gadget that allows for displacement through time and space.
Other Equipment
Flash Bombs: Romanoff used two of these flash bombs to blind some of the security guards at Hammer Industries Headquarters, easily dispatching them afterward.
Romanoff using pepper spray on a guard
Pepper Spray: Romanoff took one of the pepper sprays carried by Hammer Industries security guards, and used to dispatch the last guard before attempting to arrest Ivan Vanko.
Miniaturized Smoke Grenades: Romanoff used some miniaturized smoke grenades given to her by Phil Coulson to create a diversion on Yuri Klementiev's yacht, using the smoke to simulate a fire.
Glider Harness: Romanoff used the glider harness when she was forced to flee when Mikhail Fjodorov was killed by a woman that called herself Sofia.
Romanoff disguised as Councilwoman Hawley

Quinjet: Romanoff has used a Quinjet for transportation to travel around the world and take out threats during active missions as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and as a member of the Avengers. She usually co-pilots the Quinjet, controlling the weapons that are built into its systems.
Chitauri Chariot: During the Battle of New York, Romanoff realized that they needed to close the portal after containment proved to be overwhelming. Captain America helped her to jump on a Chitauri Chariot to quickly ascend to Stark Tower while the rest of the Avengers continued to battle the Chitauri.
Helicarrier: To be added
Jeep: During the Attack on the HYDRA Research Base, Romanoff and Barton used a Jeep to fight the HYDRA soldiers and move around faster. When all the Avengers regrouped to attack the HYDRA soldiers, Romanoff crashed the Jeep as she and Barton jumped out to continue fighting on foot.
Motorcycle: Romanoff used a Harley-Davidson LiveWire motorcycle during her missions with the Avengers prior to its destruction during the Battle of Seoul.
Truck: Romanoff drove a truck with a plow attached to its front to run over many Ultron Sentries so she could rendezvous with her fellow Avengers at the citadel.
Benatar: Romanoff and the Avengers used this ship to travel to the Garden to undo the Snap and kill Thanos. Years later, Romanoff and Hawkeye used this ship to travel to Vormir to obtain the Soul Stone during the Time Heist.
Helicopter: To be added
Facilities
Red Room Academy: Romanoff was raised and trained at the Academy from a very young age after being recruited to the KGB. There, she endured both an education and indoctrination into the world of spycraft.
Family Temporary House: Undercover as the daughter of Alexei Shostakov, Romanoff lived in a house in Ohio with the rest of her fake family for three years during her childhood.
Triskelion: To be added
Stark Industries Headquarters: When Romanoff was tasked with watching over Tony Stark by Nick Fury, she went undercover as Stark's personal assistant. As part of her undercover mission, Romanoff was required to perform tasks for Stark, working at his headquarters.
Tony Stark's Mansion: To be added
Avengers Tower: Following the collapse of S.H.I.E.L.D., Stark decided to fund the Avengers, redesigning Stark Tower as a new headquarters for the team. After retrieving Loki's Scepter, the Avengers held a party at the tower, which fell under attack by a newly-created Ultron. The Avengers then proceeded to search for Ultron in the tower, going through their files until they came across Ulysses Klaue.
Sam Wilson's Apartment: To be added
United States Capitol: To be added
Clint Barton's Homestead: When Romanoff became best friends with Clint Barton, she was one of the few people to know of his family. Romanoff would develop a close relationship with the Bartons, often visiting their home, including when all the Avengers were defeated by Ultron.
New Avengers Facility: After the Ultron Offensive, the Avengers relocated their base of operations to a facility upstate. There, Romanoff and Steve Rogers would train the new lineup of Avengers, as well as use it as their place of residence.
