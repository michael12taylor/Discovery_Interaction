John McIver, also known as Bushmaster, is the charismatic enhanced individual who had previously witnessed his family being murdered by Mama Mabel as he vowed revenge on the Stokes family. With a mission of vengeance, Bushmaster had soon arrived in Harlem to kill Mariah Stokes, the last member of the Stokes family, only to be challenged by Luke Cage who stood in the way of Bushmaster's revenge. All Bushmaster's continued attempts to kill Stokes resulted in him becoming mortally wounded, as he sought Tilda Johnson's aid for his recovery. However, Stokes took the opportunity to massacre the remaining members of Bushmaster's family, forcing him to make an uneasy alliance with Cage to stop Stokes' rampage before more innocent people got killed. Eventually, however, Bushmaster was forced to return to Jamaica to recover from his near fatal wounds, having failed to kill Stokes himself.

Biography
Early Life
Surviving an Infection
Born in Brooklyn to Gwen McIver and Quincy McIver, John McIver lived a life as the son of one of the co-owners of Harlem's Paradise. John McIver's life faced upheaval when his father was murdered by Buggy Stokes. He and his mother moved to Kingston in order to get away from the Stokes family. McIver befriended Sheldon and Gideon Shaw when he was eleven years old. Shaw considered himself as an older brother to McIver. As a child, doctors came around with a free vaccination for the children of his community. McIver was the only survivor of the children who took the vaccination. He was regarded as special by his friends and families ever since.

Meeting the Stokes Family
McIver listens to negotiations from the Stokes
For a time, McIver lived with his mother and his maternal relatives in Kingston, Anansi and Ingrid Mackintosh, working in the family's holiday resort. In one particular day, his mother met with the Stokes in order to negotiate for his father's share of assets of Harlem's Paradise. McIver witnessed the hostile negotiation between his mother and Mama Mabel. While watching the meeting, McIver was ordered by the young Mariah Stokes to find her something to drink, threatening to reveal his presence if he didn't do so.

Destruction of McIver Residence
McIver witness his mother's death
One night, while sleeping in his home, John and Gwen were attacked by Mabel and her gang. They threw a molotov cocktail made with Bushmaster Rums into the house. With the explosive quickly setting their house ablaze, the McIver attempted to make their escape. Despite John's plead for his mother to escape first, Gwen made her son get out of the house. She didn't escape in time as John watched his home burn and crumble before him. Mabel arrived, taunting and throwing the legal papers into the fire. She mockingly apologized to McIver before leaving.

Assassination Attempt

Two years later, McIver remained under the care of his uncle, Anansi and his aunt Ingrid Mackintosh. One day, while assisting his family by selling vegetables, he was approached by Pistol Pete. Unaware of the danger and not recognizing him, McIver was caught unaware as his assassin shot him in the stomach in retaliation for what his father did to Buggy Stokes.

McIver manages to survive his gunshot wound
Determined not to let his nephew die, Anansi carried McIver to the mountains to seek the aid of a healer who might be able to heal him. Once brought inside, the healer began using the Nightshade in an attempt to heal the dying McIver. As he inhaled the smokes of the burning roots, McIver began rapidly healing from his gunshot wounds. Miraculously, McIver was saved from death and his hidden powers revealed. The assassination attempt and his mother's murder from two years prior has left McIver with a burning desire for vengeance against the Stokes.

Life with the Yardies
McIver spent the next few decades honing his skills as an enforcer for the Yardies, earning him a fearsome reputation. Working within the Yardies, McIver had confrontations with Neville Barnwell and Nigel Garrison, warning them to never have any business with the Stokes Crime Family. Eventually, McIver disappeared from New York City and the Yardies believed that he will never come back.

Personal Vengeance
Taking Complete Control
Bushmaster and Sheldon head into Brooklyn
Calling himself Bushmaster, he began his quest for revenge against the Stokes family and reclaim Harlem's Paradise which he believed to be his birthright. He and his best friend, Sheldon decided to make their first preparation to be establishing themselves in United States of America. On his way to America, Bushmaster rode a yacht and asked Sheldon of where Harlem's location, saying it was from across the bridge from them. Sheldon asked if that is the place they needed to be, Bushmaster told him that Harlem needed to wait and needed to proceed to Brooklyn.

Bushmaster being reunited with Nigel Garrison
Bushmaster aimed to do that by usurping control from Nigel Garrison, who became the boss of the Yardies and decided to wait for Garrison at his hideout. Once Garrison went inside his hideout with his group, Bushmaster was spotted by him and questioned his identity to which he responded that he was in the worse shape than he thought for asking. Bushmaster clarified himself as Bushmaster towards Garrison, being told that he is now using an alias. Garrison told Bushmaster that his brother told him that Bushmaster will never come to Brooklyn but responded that his brother told him that he'll never do business with the Stokes.

Bushmaster talking down to Nigel Garrison
Having to tell Garrison, Bushmaster tried to contact his brother only for him to end up dead as he began to realize. Once Garrison told him that he has no right to know what's good for his business and being talked down by him, Bushmaster was faced with him and told him that he speaks at him and to him, insulting him for his weak stature of power. Once Garrison was unfazed by his remarks and told him that he can't take over Mariah Dillard, Bushmaster interrupted him by saying that her last name was Stokes and declared that he will take control of Harlem since it was his birthright.

Bushmaster brutally murdering Nigel Garrison
Garrison then told Bushmaster that even if he takes control of Dillard's property, he would still have to confront Luke Cage, saying that he does not answer to no one and has demonstrated his powers as being bulletproof and crumbled guns like paper. Bushmaster walked a couple of steps backwards and told Garrison about paper covering rock to which he yelled at that he is the rock too but as Bushmaster turned around, expressing that he was the rock. Bushmaster apprehended Garrison and violently killed him with his dagger, slicing his eyes out and breaking his neck.

Bushmaster yelling at Nigel Garrison's goons
Seeing Garrison's remaining goons, Bushmaster dodged one of the bullets that were fired at him and lunched himself towards one of them with an acrobatic kick. Bushmaster began attacking another goon and kicked his gun and him across the room. When one of them got up to shoot him, Bushmaster began to grapple him in a headlock and pulled his gun away. Having apprehended the goon from the ground, Bushmaster was shot by the goons who were attacked by him. Once the goons ran out of bullets, Bushmaster pulled down his shirt to show his bullets had been embedded in his chest, yelling if anyone wants knows the time or stay for work that he is planned.

Meeting his Family
Bushmaster pulling out the bullets in his chest
With the Yardies under his control, Bushmaster prepared for the next phase of his plans before going to Harlem. Returning home, Bushmaster went over to his bathroom and painfully remove the several bullets that were able to penetrate him on his chest. Once he removed all of the bullets that were harming him, Bushmaster walked down the streets of Harlem and spotted two children play fighting as Luke Cage, having to stop them and asked what they were talking about.

Bushmaster greets Anansi outside of Gwen's
Once he had asked what Luke Cage was about, one of the children told him to give Bushmaster his phone. When Bushmaster took the child's phone, Bushmaster saw the video of Luke Cage talking to the camera about his powers, saying that his enemies can't burn him, detonate him, or break him. Finished watching the video, Bushmaster proceeded to give the boy his phone and told them if Cage wanted anyone to test his abilities they should let him know, bidding a farewell towards them. While walking down the streets, Bushmaster saw his uncle Anansi as a waiter at Gwen's and proceeded to walk down and greet him.

Bushmaster and Anansi have a drink and talk
Inside Gwen's, Bushmaster sat down at the counter and was told that he shouldn't have come back. Despite his warnings, Bushmaster expressed that he wanted to see his family and the man who saved his life and gave him power, but Anansi told him that the power didn't come from him instead of within. Once they sat next to each other, Bushmaster was told that is was a long time ago since Gwen McIver had past away and responded that he will vow revenge but Anansi told him that Mariah Dillard was smart enough to ignore the past, much to Bushmaster's dismay. Anansi then commented on Bushmaster's shirt had blood on it.

Bushmaster vows to take down Mariah Dillard
Bushmaster demanded that he needed more Nightshade but was told by Anansi that the more he needed the more it hurts, working as steroid. Once Anansi gave a place that sold Nightshade, Bushmaster looked over to the television and listened to the program that claimed Luke Cage being faster than Usain Bolt, resulting into a rant by Bushmaster about him. Bushmaster then asked Anansi if Cage worked for Dillard to which he was told the opposite. Bushmaster then told Anansi that he needed Dillard's money and Cage's publicity, but was retracted, learning that Cage was a hard man to kill. Bushmaster would then tell Anansi that he wouldn't have to use a bullet to kill him.

Getting Nightshade
Bushmaster buying items from Tilda Johnson
Following the address provided by his uncle, Bushmaster went over to Mother's Touch and was greeted by Tilda Johnson, who asked of what he needed. Bushmaster told her that she was the person to meet up for the items he needed. Bushmaster gave Johnson the ingredients, looking suspicious at the list she was given and responded that it looked as if it was used for Obeah. Bushmaster quickly told to just give him what he wants and make fast as possible. As he looked around the place and waited for the items he needed, Bushmaster was finally given his ingredients of Nightshade and gave Johnson some money to which she responded that it was too much. Bushmaster thanked her for being generous and helpful, saying his farewell to her.

Bushmaster regaining his Nightshade powers
Alone at his own home, Bushmaster performed an Obeah ritual in his bathroom and send his newly ordered Nightshade on fire. While the ounces of smoke had settled in, Bushmaster heavily breathe in each puff of smoke as he began to quickly suffer the side effects. Bushmaster channeled the plants' power of healing as his wounds had completely disappeared and his strength had caused him to break a part of his sink with his bare hands, taking in the moment that he had finally gained his powers again.

Setting the Plan
Bushmaster welcoming Sheldon into his home
After a good night sleep with two women in bed, Bushmaster woke up from bed at sunrise and went up to the other room. Bushmaster then greeted Sheldon, asking if he wants any coffee that was imported from his home, but Bushmaster dismisses his offer since he expressed that he had two cups from the night before. Bushmaster then asked Sheldon what was the agenda, being told that Mariah Dillard had change location and it is best to go to Brooklyn for more attraction with the people. Bushmaster walked up to Sheldon and was informed that Arturo Rey III was dead, saying that Luke Cage has been on the scene.

Bushmaster talking about killing Mariah Dillard
Having suspicions upon Cage, Bushmaster asked Sheldon if he was close to Dillard, but was told that she hates him as much as he does. Bushmaster told Sheldon that Cage vexed him because of his existence, taking over Harlem will be a lot harder as two boons can't live together for this type of reputation. Being told by Sheldon he shouldn't be distracted, Bushmaster listened to him about Dillard and the people she worked for will end up knowing about Nigel Garrison but Bushmaster said that he will confront her, explaining that he needed her to be nice and fat when he kills her. After knowing Shades was at Harlem's Paradise, Bushmaster declared that soon he'll know everything and burn Dillard.

Bushmaster gives all of the money to Shades
On the time when the deal with Garrison had to give money to Dillard, Bushmaster was greeted by Shades inside of his hideout where he was asked about wanting to speak with Garrison. Bushmaster then insisted on having all of Garrison's businesses was now his business. While Shades was unsure of him, Bushmaster was told that he was representing Mariah Dillard. Bushmaster then ordered Sheldon to give the handbag toward Shades and dropped it on the ground. Bushmaster walked over to the money that Garrison had promised.

Bushmaster reevaluating the deal with Shades
Once Shades opened the bag and found Garrison's decapitated head on the money, Bushmaster told him that that Garrison had a big head and mouth but had small ideas, saying that he had no vision. Once Shades became hostile toward him, Bushmaster wanted to reevaluate the value of their gun deal and wished for Shades to convince him to still continue with their deal. Once they were done with their new deal, Bushmaster promised Dillard's deal and gave them more money than Garrison was bidding towards them.

Meeting Luke Cage
Bushmaster being confronted by Luke Cage
When Luke Cage had broken into the Yardies' Hideout, Bushmaster and his group had walked up to him and talked about how mad that going up to his turf and how he was not faster than Usain Bolt. Cage told Bushmaster where was Nigel Garrison's location but he told Cage that he was gone and headed elsewhere. Asking if he had any to say, Bushmaster told Cage to ask him anything to which he demanded any attempt to build a deal with Dillard, but Bushmaster interrupted and told him that her last name was Stokes. Listening to Cage about stopping Dillard for himself and anyone associated with, Bushmaster was further told that he must stay out Harlem, causing to laugh at him.

Bushmaster observing Luke Cage's abilities
Once Bushmaster taunted Cage for his righteous attempt to fight him, he ordered his goons to battle against Cage, however, when a few of them had suffered a beatdown, Bushmaster sent his firing squad to shoot at him but Cage ricocheted one of the bullets off of his chest and ended up grazing one of his men. Bushmaster then ordered one of his goons to send a grenade and toss it at Cage only for him to suffer less when he withstand the explosion with his bare hands. Once Cage passed his attempt to hurt him, Bushmaster stared on as he walked out of the hideout, much to his dismay from Cage's confidence.

Bushmaster trains himself to fight Luke Cage
On the night of his another Obeah ritual, Bushmaster went on to use Nightshade and burn what he had remained to practice his moves before facing Cage, finishing his inhalation of the plant as began training. Using the footage that Sheldon had sent him while he was recording, Bushmaster used his fighting skills while watching and acrobatically used them to his advantage. Once the footage was finished, Bushmaster ended his practice with his final kick and looked head-on to relax. Once he was sufficiently prepared, Bushmaster left to confront his opponent in Harlem.

Ambush on Luke Cage
Bushmaster talking down to Luke Cage
Tracking down Luke Cage in Harlem, Bushmaster confronted him and knocked him down with a single punch. Once Cage was on the ground, Bushmaster taunted him in front of his face and proceeded to use his words against him by saying to stay out of his yard but Harlem is not his yard it is his. Once he got up, Bushmaster began to fight against Cage and once he managed to throw a punch toward Bushmaster, he became unfazed from the blow. As the fight had become more serious, Bushmaster continued to fight against Cage and soon gained the upper hand with a kick, pushing Cage toward a pole that he broke upon impact.

Bushmaster brutally beating down Luke Cage
Winning from the fight, Bushmaster began to taunt at Cage's fighting skills, talking on behalf that he can't talk tough if he can't breathe. Using his superior fighting style to his advantage, Bushmaster used his own enhanced strength and Cage's lack of knowledge and preparation to punch him and trade blows with each kick. As Cage became weary of how many kicks he had taken, Bushmaster single-handedly defeated Cage with a spinning back kick in front of the people of Harlem, knocking down his opponent unconscious, taunting further as he laid on the ground.

Bushmaster declaring his name to the public
When Dave Griffith was done filming the fight, he asked Bushmaster of who he was and interrupted his unfinished question and introduced himself as Bushmaster. When Griffith asked who he was again, Bushmaster told him that he was the stone that the builder refused before leaving the scene with his task to undermine Cage's reputation achieved. Once he finished his fight with Cage, the news report was gaining more public outcry as they began to gaze upon Bushmaster's ability to go toe-to-toe against Cage during the fight.

Confronting Mariah Dillard
Bushmaster entering inside Harlem's Paradise
During the night, Bushmaster went over to Harlem's Paradise and looked over for anyone with Mariah Dillard. Bushmaster spotted Dillard and Shades on the upstairs floor and proceeded to walk forward into that particular area. Bushmaster was then greeted by Dillard, proceeding their mutual handshake. Given Bushmaster Rum, Dillard was glad that he came to visit and was disappointed to go back to Jamaica but Bushmaster told her that Harlem began to feel like home and will stay for a while. Bushmaster observed the craftsmanship of the bar and questioned Dillard about the design. Dillard responded that she had no idea when the bar was built but her grandfather had partners that renovated the place.

Bushmaster meeting with Mariah Dillard
Bushmaster then asked Dillard about Quincy McIver to which she dismisses him and told him that he probably wasn't important. Being told that the public remembers Kings and Queens and not the flunkies, Bushmaster told Dillard about the blues that were on stage were a sign of the ancestors and how you can't erase it nor burn it, calling it magic and science at its pure form. Having Dillard failing to understand, Bushmaster told her to look where she was standing and how it was the perfect place to hear the music and see everything that is being said. Bushmaster further commented that the rum was smooth, being told by Dillard that it's only own for private stock and not sold in stores.

Bushmaster making threats to Mariah Dillard
Bushmaster told Dillard that the rum was a family recipe and only two men know how to make it only for them to be dead. When Dillard told him that things are better left dead and frozen in the ice, Bushmaster told her that an old fire stick is easy to the light and her firearms will severe him well. Planning to walk out, Bushmaster told Dillard that it was a pleasure doing business with her, calling by her last name Stokes. After being sworn upon by Dillard after being called Stokes, Bushmaster was threatened by her and told to take care of herself as the life so precious, drinking his shot of the rum and leaving Harlem's Paradise.

Bushmaster returns to meet Anansi at Gwen's
After leaving Harlem's Paradise, Bushmaster arrived at Gwen's to meet his family. Bushmaster was then greeted by Jerome and talked about how he defeated Luke Cage. Bushmaster then noticed Ingrid Mackintosh and was told that he should have called, hugging her afterwards. Noticing his fellow uncle, Bushmaster then began to talk to him about what happened at Harlem's Paradise and how it felt like his kingdom and even got to drink Bushmaster rum. Bushmaster gave Anansi money but was rejected for never having to ask for anything. Bushmaster's money was then taken away by Ingrid. After having drinks with his family, Bushmaster then left Gwen's and hugged his uncle outside the restaurant.

Bushmaster's Revenge

With Dillard's weapons and her underestimating him, Bushmaster and the Stylers killed Cockroach Hamilton, Mark Higgins and Ray Ray. Decapitating the heads of his victims, Bushmaster placed them at the entrance of Shirley Chisholm Complex. While watching a soccer game with his family, Bushmaster argues with Anansi about how much his national team should not lose, despite their optimism. When the game started to be interrupted with an WJBP-TV news report, Bushmaster and his family watched the incident of murders of the Shirley Chisholm Complex and the financier Piranha Jones has now been missing.

Bushmaster calls Sheldon to look for Piranha
Bushmaster then listened to Anansi's about the news, saying the murder was pure savagery and only seeing fear. With that in mind, Bushmaster then pulled out his phone and walked out of Gwen's to call Sheldon. Bushmaster talked to Sheldon about what was happening in their situation and was informed that Jones was protected by Luke Cage. Bushmaster questioned Sheldon if he used the Harlem's Hero app and was told that he did but couldn't find Cage. Bushmaster then told Sheldon to order every cab and flood the streets until they find Jones and Cage, telling Sheldon to not show any weaknesses or make any excuses.

Bushmaster argues with Anansi about revenge
After finishing up some labor work at Gwen's, Bushmaster told Ingrid Mackintosh to go home, having a kiss from his aunt before she left the place. Bushmaster then argued with Anansi for showing disrespect for what they saw in the news. Bushmaster tried to reason with Anansi that the Stokes family took everything from him and needed to burn Mariah Dillard, having an agreement with Anansi that he should kill her. As Anansi began to rant about how this act of violence makes his people look bad, Bushmaster expressed how much he didn't care how his people will look.

Bushmaster and Anansi discuss finding peace
Listening to Anansi about how once his people came to America they had to build everything from scratch and work hard over education, Bushmaster then began to argue that the country already turned on him and it all started with the Stokes, who think they could do whatever they want. Anansi explains that you can't change the past and all you could do is build for the next generation, telling Bushmaster to find peace in his heart. Bushmaster confronted his uncle and told him that in his heart it means war.

Duel at High Bridge
Bushmaster agrees to fight against Luke Cage
The next day, Bushmaster received a call from Luke Cage. His opponent challenged him to a fight, making a deal that if he won, Bushmaster and his gang must leave Harlem whereas if Bushmaster won, he will receive Piranha Jones. Agreeing to the challenge, Bushmaster told Cage that he will be meeting him at High Bridge at noon.

Bushmaster confronts Luke Cage on a bridge
Heading to the agreed location, Bushmaster confronted Cage, talking to him and boasted his identity of what had happened to him in his past fights. Once again, they talked about their differences, and Cage made it known that he knew about Bushmaster's actions should be done by living in someone's life. Bushmaster countered his statement by telling him what will happen if he did, stating he'll just get a job, loving a woman, and raising children. Bushmaster questioned if Cage would live the life of the family. Bushmaster made another offer of the alliance but, Cage refused again.

Bushmaster fighting Luke Cage at High Bridge
Knowing that they won't be able to come to terms, Bushmaster engaged in a fight for talking too much. At first, Bushmaster held the advantage during the fight through the usage of his fighting style and his agility. Bushmaster continued to land hits against his opponent, however, Cage was prepared and his bulletproof skin protected him from suffering major damage. Having gotten used to his fighting style, Cage began landing hits on his face which injured Bushmaster. As the fight kept dragging on, Bushmaster, exhausted and injured, realized that he had to resort to trickery in order to defeat his opponent.

Bushmaster speaks to and defeats Luke Cage
During an opening, Bushmaster pulled poisoned powder from his pocket and blew it at Cage's face, instantly paralyzing him. Cage was confused about why he couldn't move his body and began to stand his ground. Bushmaster had told what is happened to him and explained that it was caused by the power that he wouldn't understand. Having grown to admire his opponent's tenacity, Bushmaster declared his respect for Cage and sincerely wished that they could have been friends before kicking him off a bridge and into a river to drown. Victorious, Bushmaster went to claim Jones.

Capturing Piranha Jones
Bushmaster asking Piranha Jones to help him
Bushmaster enters the warehouse where Piranha Jones was held captive and had to talk to Sheldon directly about passwords. Bushmaster then touched Jones on his shoulders and expressed that he needs to have everything that Mariah Dillard has ever own. Being handed a laptop, Bushmaster then offered Piranha Jones to let him move her money assets to him but he reluctantly didn't want to because of his professional integrity. Bushmaster gave Piranha the laptop and told him that he has to do give all assets to him. Being aggressive towards him, Bushmaster told them to call her Stokes after Piranha told him that he had nothing to do with Dillard's business.

Bushmaster threatening Piranha Jones' life
Trying to persuade him, Bushmaster spoke about making Jones do the things he asked what was considered the right thing, as putting it is right as rain. Once Jones typed up his password, Bushmaster was told that Luke Cage will come after Jones, much to Bushmaster's sarcastic chuckle. As Jones kept talking about how Cage can't be killed, Bushmaster became more hostile and told him to type faster. Once Piranha Jones had been given what the Stylers want, Bushmaster ordered his goons to decapitate him and put his head on a fish tank of water with piranhas.

Anansi's Advice
Bushmaster talks to Anansi about his revenge
Arrived at Dapper Dan, Bushmaster and Anansi were picking out suits and having then tailored beforehand. While getting his measurements, Bushmaster told his uncle what was wrong and joking around. Bushmaster listened on about how would Gwen McIver would feel about his vengeance against the Stokes Crime Family from his uncle. Bushmaster told a story from his childhood about his mother would get mad at him for getting his school clothes dirty and wanting him to look respectable. Bushmaster went on about how she always cooks and cleans but walked around like a queen and how she talked about his father was well adept.

Furthermore, Bushmaster talked about how he got his shirt ripped, clothes bloody, tie loose, and wearing one shoe so he could protect his family name, but would get his mother quiet when she sees him like that. Noticing how mad she was with him, Bushmaster saw her eyes as she was proud of him, realizing her mother knew that he was a warrior and never a puppet or slave. Wanting to have all that Dillard has, Bushmaster was told that he can't be fulfilled with money while other Jamaicans are being harassed by the police.

Bushmaster asks Anansi why he is not furious
Being asked of what he really wants, Bushmaster wanted Dillard's soul for her mother's, saying that you can't drown sorrow with tears and if you want to get rid of sorrow you must burn it. Turning to question Anansi, Bushmaster asked him why doesn't he have more fury and was told that he doesn't look into the past and that vengeance belongs to the Lord, responding that the Lord can have it back when he is done. McIver was then informed by Sheldon about Mariah Dillard's time for her demise.

Revenge through Fire

Breaking into Mariah Dillard's Brownstone, Bushmaster confronted her before taking bullets from her Stokes' Revolver gun. Bushmaster apprehended Dillard and recognized Tilda Johnson from Mother's Touch, telling her she could have mistaken her as one of the Stokes.
