<html><p>Coulson's suspicions towards Senator Ellen Nadeer kept growing. He devised  plan to be able to watch her. Daisy Johnson would go to the Capitol to sign the Sokovia Accords, where Nadeer would be in attendance. Meanwhile, Yo-Yo Rodriguez would plant a camera in her office. Despite General Glenn Talbot's initial protest, the plan was sanctioned by Jeffrey Mace. Before departing, Coulson and Talbot argued about their mutual behaviors. At the Capitol, Coulson and Rodriguez infiltrated Nadeer's office, but the Senator had expected their operation and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were arrested by Capitol security.

Coulson, Fitz and Simmons arrest Radcliffe
Since the security guards seemed to know that Rodriguez would be on the mission, Coulson and Johnson suspected the presence of a mole within S.H.I.E.L.D. Nadeer used the break-in to justify a full-scale investigation of S.H.I.E.L.D. Talbot was angry that the mission had failed and brought scrutiny on the organization. He told Coulson that relegitimizing S.H.I.E.L.D. may have been a mistake. Coulson and the other agents returned to the Playground. There, Leo Fitz disclosed what he had discovered by studying Aida's severed head: Holden Radcliffe was responsible for Aida's rebellion. Coulson led a S.H.I.E.L.D. squad to the Radcliffe Residence to arrest the scientist.

After returning to the Playground, Coulson had a drink with Melinda May, still unaware that he was talking to a Life-Model Decoy engineered by Radcliffe.

A Fake Melinda May
Sam Koenig alerted S.H.I.E.L.D. that Billy Koenig had been abducted by the Watchdogs, prompting Phil Coulson to arrange his rescue. Coulson quickly deduced that Holden Radcliffe, who had let one of his Life-Model Decoys get arrested in his place, was behind Billy's abduction, as Coulson had entrusted Billy with the Darkhold. The S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were soon joined by Sam, who told them he had lost the trail of the kidnappers. Coulson then tasked Daisy Johnson and Sam to investigate.

Sam revealed that he knew about the Darkhold. He, along with Billy and their sister, LT Koenig, had hidden the book. Coulson and his team located LT and brought her aboard Zephyr One, along with the last Koenig sibling, Thurston. LT told S.H.I.E.L.D. that Billy had hidden the Darkhold within the Labyrinth. Johnson told Coulson that she suspected Anton Ivanov was responsible for Billy's abduction. Fearing the Watchdogs could get their hands on the Darkhold, Coulson took his agents to the Labyrinth to fetch the Book of Spells and secure it.

May's LMD turns against Coulson
While Sam went to retrieve the Darkhold, Coulson and May had a conversation which ended in a kiss. Immediately after, LT warned them that the Watchdogs were coming. Sam got the Darkhold and gave it to May, but when Coulson told May to give him the book, May pulled out her gun and aimed it at Coulson. At first puzzled, Coulson soon realized that the real Melinda May had been replaced by an LMD several days earlier and that the LMD was programmed to retrieve the Darkhold for Radcliffe. Quake appeared in time to take down May's LMD. Meanwhile, the Watchdogs arrived, holding Billy as a hostage. A fight erupted and during the melee, Radcliffe managed to escape with the Darkhold.

Coulson returned to the Playground, where he witnessed the destruction of Aida's head and Radcliffe's LMD. However, Coulson could not bring himself to order the destruction of May's LMD.

Encountering Agnes Kitsworth
After investigating, Coulson learned of Agnes Kitsworth, Holden Radcliffe's former girlfriend. Suspecting that Kitsworth could lead S.H.I.E.L.D. to Melinda May, Coulson and Alphonso Mackenzie flew to Caldes de Montbui to find her. Coulson approached Kitsworth while she was drawing and hinted that he knew about her history with Radcliffe. Kitsworth rebuffed him, but Coulson and Mackenzie showed Kitsworth a picture of Aida, which looked exactly like Kitsworth. She reluctantly told them about her relationship with Radcliffe and that she had left him because he could not cure her of a brain tumor. Kitsworth then departed, insensitive to Coulson's arguments.

Coulson found Kitsworth's address and intended to arrest her, but Mackenzie advised him against it and refused to go along. Coulson went to Kitsworth's apartment, where, instead of arresting her, he apologized for his behavior and told Kitsworth about May being kidnapped by Radcliffe and replaced by a Life-Model Decoy. Touched, she agreed to cooperate with S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson had Kitsworth contact Radcliffe and lure him to Caldes de Montbui so Colson could arrest him. Radcliffe came, along with some Watchdogs , but he persuaded Kitsworth to go with him and he escaped, before Coulson and Mackenzie could arrest him. However, by eavesdropping on the conversation between Kitsworth and Radcliffe, Coulson learned that May was still alive.

Assault on the Superior's Base
Coulson experiences the Framework's system
Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons demonstrated a Framework simulation so that S.H.I.E.L.D. would comprehend where Melinda May was being kept. Agent James Davis informed Coulson that the suit of Jeffrey Mace, who had been kidnapped by the Watchdogs, had been located in Nome, Alaska. Coulson and the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents boarded Zephyr One and headed for Nome.

Coulson discovering the Superior's obsession
There, Coulson discovered the Patriot Suit and a wall covered with newspaper articles and photographs related to himself. Daisy Johnson informed him that the Russian mining facility shown in one picture belonged to the Superior. Coulson recalled his mission with May to this facility several years ago and decided to return there to find answers.

Coulson and his men assault Superior's base
At the abandoned mining facility, Coulson and his team found several skeletons, and one of them had a mobile phone in his skull. When the phone rang, it was the Superior, who told Coulson that the skeletons belonged to the soldiers who were guarding the facility at the time of Coulson's previous mission. The Superior threatened to kill both Mace and May. The agents tracked the Watchdogs' location to Krasnoyarsk Krai. Coulson and his team stormed the Superior's base and Coulson soon confronted the Superior himself.

Coulson has a confrontation with the Superior
The Superior said he held Coulson responsible for all the alien related events back to the Chitauri invasion. Coulson dismissed the Superior's accusations, saying he only cared about his friends. The conversation was interrupted by Quake, who came to fight the Superior. Coulson and Alphonso Mackenzie found a weakened Mace and rescued him. However, the three were captured by Aida, replaced with Life-Model Decoys and plugged into the Framework.

The Framework
Just a Teacher
Phil Coulson as a teacher in the Framework
The Framework had been built by Leo Fitz to run training simulations. Holden Radcliffe altered the Framework when he was holding May captive, so that she would stop trying to escape. He made it so the Framework would take away a person's greatest regret. When Coulson was scanned in, it turned out his main regret was joining S.H.I.E.L.D., robbing him of a normal life. So in the Framework, when Nick Fury approached Coulson about joining S.H.I.E.L.D., he rejected the offer. He instead became a mild mannered history teacher, with a particular interest in the Cold War. When HYDRA rose to power, Coulson was forced to teach their propaganda in his classes. Whenever HYDRA goons showed up to arrest one of his students, Chris Adler, Coulson did nothing to interfere.

Coulson always had a sense that something wasn't right, since his previous experience with memory alteration prevented his real memories from being fully suppressed. Coulson believed the Cambridge Incident - the catalyst for HYDRA's American dictatorship - had been deliberately engineered by a HYDRA sleeper agent, as it made no sense for the mentally unstable Katya Belyakov to be enrolled at the school she attacked. He mistakenly believed HYDRA was enriching soap with mind-controlling chemicals, and so he made his own soap. He also collected things related to his life in the real world, without understanding why, including a brochure for Tahiti and a calendar page for the month of May with a picture of a Corvette.

Coulson reports Jemma Simmons to HYDRA
One day Jemma Simmons entered his classroom after his students had left. She called Coulson by name and claimed that the world he lived in was a digital prison and that he was in reality a high-ranking agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson was unconvinced. Before he called HYDRA to report her as a subversive, Simmons triggered one of his memories by saying, "It's a magical place". That was the phrase which had been implanted as part of his false memories of vacationing in Tahiti, meant to prevent the negative side-effects of Project T.A.H.I.T.I. After Simmons left, Coulson looked in bewilderment at the things he had collected which were associated with his real life.

Coulson meeting Daisy Johnson
Later, Daisy Johnson broke into his car, calling him by name and begging him to remember her. Coulson insisted that he did not know her, but when Daisy said that he was the closest thing she had to family, he finally regained his memory of the young woman he thought of as a daughter.

The Truth Revealed
After Coulson regained his memory of her, Daisy Johnson helped him cope with the news that he was trapped inside the Framework. Coulson and Johnson then had to leave Alexander Pierce High School when Grant Ward warned Daisy, his girlfriend in the Framework, that HYDRA intended to arrest Coulson. Johnson took Coulson to her apartment, where they were reunited with Jemma Simmons. When Johnson and Simmons mentioned Holden Radcliffe, Coulson produced a newspaper article about the scientist, prompting Johnson to try to locate him while Coulson and Simmons went to a meeting with the resistance.

Coulson and Simmons met a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who took them to the Playground, where they met the leader of the resistance: the Patriot. Mace told Coulson and Simmons about S.H.I.E.L.D.'s history, then Ward showed up and informed them that HYDRA had Johnson, so she could not join them. Ward gave them Radcliffe's location. He was on the island of Ogygia. 

Coulson, Simmons and Ward flew a Quinjet to Ogygia and quickly found Radcliffe. They confronted the scientist and intended to take him back to the Playground. Before they could interrogate Radcliffee, a HYDRA squad led by Madame Hydra and The Doctor arrived with Zephyr One.  Coulson, Simmons and Ward hid in the bushes and watched the confrontation between HYDRA and Radcliffe. When The Doctor shot Agnes Kitsworth, who had been captured by the HYDRA soldiers, Simmons screamed in horror, revealing their presence. A gunfight erupted but Coulson, Simmons and Ward managed to escape Ogygia.

Back at the Playground, Mace questioned the three about what had happened on Ogygia. Simmons broke down and left the room and Coulson told Mace and Ward to go easy on her. Shortly after, agent Burrows brought in Alphonso Mackenzie, who wanted to join S.H.I.E.L.D.

Losing a Leader
The Patriot and Coulson discover the HYDRA body bags
Coulson helped the Patriot fake a car accident in order to stop a HYDRA bus thought to be carrying prisoners. While waiting for the bus, Coulson told Mace that he trusted Jemma Simmons, even if her story about a brainwashed Leo Fitz seemed unbelievable. After taking down the HYDRA team, they discovered that the bus was filled with corpses, and neither Daisy Johnson nor Antoine Triplett, whom the Patriot was looking for, were in the vehicle. Coulson returned to the Playground and assisted some refugees until Simmons came to him. Simmons suggested disclosing the truth about the Framework to Mace, but Coulson advised against it.

Coulson and Mace infiltrate the HYDRA Enlightenment Cultivation Center
Coulson later volunteered to join a mission to the HYDRA Enlightenment Cultivation Center. Before departing, he and Simmons met Alphonso Mackenzie and his daughter Hope. Mace later summoned Coulson and provided him with the alias, Jamie Flugelman, a HYDRA agent. Coulson used this alias to drive the recently stolen HYDRA bus to the Center, smuggling the Patriot and agent Burrows inside. Coulson and Mace made their way through the Center and released the prisoners, including Triplett. Before leaving the Center, Coulson spotted one of his former students, Chris Adler, being taken to another building. Coulson decided to save him and entered the building, discovering a room full of children and teenagers being indoctrinated with HYDRA propaganda via the Faustus method. Coulson and Triplett released the children, but in the meantime, a HYDRA squad led by Melinda May had arrived.

When the HYDRA Quinjet fired at the building, the ceiling collapsed. Chris was trapped beneath the rubble with Mace, who managed to save the teen, despite May's arrival. Unfortunately, Mace could not escape. He told Coulson and the others to go while he kept the building standing as long as he could. Coulson and the others fled and watched the building collapse before returning to the Playground.

The New Face of the Rebellion
Coulson mourned the death of the Patriot, and feared that his death would put an end to the rebellion. Coulson later watched a news report about Daisy Johnson's escape from the Triskelion and Grant Ward asked for Coulson's help in finding her. Coulson advised him against it and recalled the time when he turned down an opportunity to join S.H.I.E.L.D. In return, Ward told Coulson about the time when Victoria Hand recruited him.

Coulson remained at the Playground until Agent Burrows told him and Alphonso Mackenzie that they had possibly located Johnson. Coulson, Burrows and Mackenzie went to assist her and arrived in time to save Daisy and Melinda May from the HYDRA agents chasing them. All of them then returned to the Playground, where May displayed the footage of the body cam she carried during the Infiltration into the HYDRA Enlightenment Cultivation Center and suggested they show it to the public to reveal HYDRA's atrocities. However, Johnson was keen on finding the backdoor Holden Radcliffe had told her about and did not want to waste time in the Framework. Coulson replied that helping S.H.I.E.L.D. to broadcast the footage could actually help them to escape the Framework, as it would weaken HYDRA and make the backdoor more accessible.

Phil Coulson on the S.H.I.E.L.D. subversive broadcast
To that end, Coulson joined a team led by Ward to assault the HYDRA Broadcasting Center. After taking Sunil Bakshi and his team hostage, they recorded and broadcast a subversive message featuring Coulson himself calling for open revolt. Ward and Burrows stayed behind to defend the place, while Coulson and the others began to make their way to the backdoor.

Leaving the Framework
Back at the Playground, Coulson talked with Melinda May about the rebellion against HYDRA and tried to convince her that the Framework was not realty. May did not believe him and demanded evidence that Coulson did not have. Later, Coulson noticed that everyone at the Playground was staring at him and May explained that he had become the new face of the rebellion following the Siege of the HYDRA Broadcasting Center. The S.H.I.E.L.D. team had to prepare to leave the Framework, but May told Coulson and Daisy Johnson that Jemma Simmons had left to meet Alistair Fitz.

Once Simmons returned, the team flew to the coordinates given them by Holden Radcliffe and arrived at a steel mill where the backdoor was supposed to be. Coulson pinpointed the backdoor, but it turned out to be in a pool of molten steel. Alphonso Mackenzie, who had not been told about the Framework and thought he was in a real world, voiced his protest, as did May, who still had trouble believing the whole story. 

Coulson finally leaves the Framework
A HYDRA squad stormed the facility and attacked the team. When Johnson opened the portal, Coulson tried to go through it but was shot by a HYDRA agent. Heavily wounded, Coulson told May to throw him through the portal and she did. Coulson awoke in the real world, back at Anton Ivanov's base. Seconds later, May woke up as well. Spotting Aida plugged into the Framework, Coulson destroyed her body by cutting off her head. Coulson and May were later joined by Leo Fitz, who was traumatized by his actions as The Doctor in the Framework. Before they could help Fitz, Aida appeared in the living body she had she had created for herself, and teleported away with Fitz.

Back to the Real World
Coulson defeating the Superior with his Shield
Coulson and Melinda May had little time to process the fact that Aida had gained Inhuman powers before they were confronted by Anton Ivanov, who attacked them with one of his synthetic bodies. Coulson destroyed the android with to his Energy Shield but upon discovering that the base was filled with Ivanov's bodies, Coulson and May locked themselves in the room and tried to figure out their next move. Coulson used the time to inform May of all she had missed while she was held captive in the Framework. Two copies of Ivanov eventually breached the door, forcing Coulson and May to destroy them. Ivanov left the base after ordering it be destroyed by flooding.

Coulson brought May to the surface, just in time to see reinforcements come with Zephyr One. Alphonso Mackenzie was still trapped within the base which was on the verge of complete collapse. Fortunately, he was saved by Aida and Leo Fitz, enabling Coulson and the others to safely board Zephyr One and return to the Playground, although it had been destroyed during the Siege of the Playground. After Aida and Fitz were locked inside a Containment Chamber, Coulson and the others tried to plan their next course of action.

Coulson getting confronted by Glenn Talbot
While Aida went crazy after Fitz rejected her love, Glenn Talbot and his men stormed the Playground to arrest Coulson and the remaining S.H.I.E.L.D. agents for the actions committed by their LMDs in the Siege of the Playground. Coulson explained the full story to Talbot and he and Daisy Johnson persuaded the General to let them leave on Zephyr One before Aida could kill them all.

Destruction of Aida
Coulson transforming into Ghost Rider
Aboard Zephyr One, Coulson discovered that Yo-Yo Rodriguez had plugged herself into the Framework to bring back Alphonso Mackenzie. At same time, Aida had launched the destruction of the alternate reality, endangering the lives of both Rodriguez and Mackenzie. Later, Coulson was contacted by Glenn Talbot on his way to an international inquiry and told him that no one from S.H.I.E.L.D. could attend the meeting. Upon hanging up, Coulson learned from Daisy Johnson that Ghost Rider had resurfaced. The Rider was brought to Zephyr One, where he told Coulson and the others that he was drawn by Aida, as she was made from dark matter and that he could help S.H.I.E.L.D. defeat her.

After Talbot was shot by a Daisy Johnson's Life-Model Decoy, Coulson led his team to save the General and reclaim the Darkhold. Johnson and Reyes dispatched the Life-Model Decoys and made Aida flee once more. Coulson and the others discussed what Aida's plan was and concluded that she intended to rally people together in their fear of Inhumans in order to create the fascist world she ruled over in the Framework. Coulson asked Reyes if the Spirit of Vengeance residing in him was as desperate to destroy Aida as they were. He said it was. Coulson said he had a plan. They returned to the ruined Playground, intending to use the Darkhold as bait to lure Aida to her destruction, while also refueling Zephyr One so it could  continue powering the Framework to ensure Rodriguez's and Mackenzie's survival.

Coulson's Ghost Rider finally destroys Aida
As Coulson powered up an Inter-Dimensional Gate to send the Darkhold back to Hell, he was confronted by Aida, who told him that the only person who could stop her was Ghost Rider but he was not present. Coulson told Aida she should value teamwork and suddenly Jemma Simmons opened fire on Aida with a submachine gun. When Aida then moved to kill Simmons, Coulson stood in her way and Aida gloated, saying Coulson could not kill her. Coulson told Aida that the Spirit of Vengeance could and immediately transformed into Ghost Rider, revealing that he had struck a bargain with the demonic entity. Aida tried to escape but Coulson used Ghost Rider's Chain to trap her and eventually killed with the powers of the Spirit of Vengeance.

The Spirit of Vengeance then went back into Reyes' body. Coulson entrusted him with the Darkhold and Reyes returned to Hell. Rodriguez and Mackenzie, having finally exited the Framework, warned that the authorities were on their way to arrest them. When Leo Fitz offered to take the blame for the team, Coulson joined the others in telling him that they all needed to remain together. Coulson took his team to Rae's Restaurant where they, with the exception of Fitz, were abducted by Enoch.

The Dark and Deep Future
Into the Lighthouse
Coulson finds himself trapped in space
Through the use of the Time Di'Alla, Coulson was transported aboard what appeared to be a space station, where time stood still as a window was destroyed but nothing moved. Time soon resumed its course, and Coulson had to struggle against being sucked into space. Coulson asked two other men who were there about his situation, but they were interrupted by a gruesome scream. Shortly after, one of the men was snatched away by a creature while Coulson and the other man locked themselves in a room to keep the creature out.

Coulson meeting Virgil
The man introduced himself as Virgil, a True Believer in S.H.I.E.L.D. Before Coulson could learn more, Virgil was knocked out by Alphonso Mackenzie who thought Virgil was threatening Coulson. Coulson and Mackenzie took the unconscious Virgil with them and were reunited with Yo-Yo Rodriguez and Jemma Simmons. They discussed finding themselves in space, waiting for Virgil to regain consciousness and give an explanation. Coulson told his friends that he had never heard about a space station inhabited by Humans.

Virgil eventually awakened and disclosed that he knew all their names. He also told Coulson and the others that Leo Fitz was not there with them and that S.H.I.E.L.D. had been sent to save Humanity. Before Virgil could continue, he was killed by a Vrellnexian, forcing Coulson and his friends to flee. The creature caught up with them, but they were rescued by Quake, who destroyed the Vrellnexian with her powers.

Coulson and his team reuniting
Coulson and the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents still struggled to understand where they were and how they had gotten there. Coulson assured them that it had nothing to do with his deal with Ghost Rider. They explored the facility, discovering that it had been designed for Human survival, but that some of the equipment featured extraterrestrial warnings. Before they could investigate further, they were violently arrested by two Kree guards who locked them up in a cell.

Coulson tries to get answers from Deke Shaw
While Mackenzie and Rodriguez were taken away to be interrogated, Coulson, Simmons and Johnson were released by Deke Shaw, accompanied by a wounded Melinda May. They tried to get answers from Shaw, but he was reluctant to help them after learning of Virgil's death. May pinned Shaw against a wall with his Gravity Puck and Coulson interrogated him. The conversation with Shaw made him understand that he and his agents had been sent into a future where Earth had been destroyed.

Learning the Truth
Coulson was present when Melinda May and Jemma Simmons returned from their journey aboard the Trawler, and they discussed the fact that they had been sent into the future. Coulson and the others were then approached by Tess, another inhabitant of the Lighthouse, who was told about Virgil's death. Although Tess was doubtful that the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents actually came from the past, she eventually believed it upon noticing that Coulson had no sign of ever having worn a Metric on his wrist.

Coulson searches Virgil's room
Coulson accompanied the rest of the group to the Exchange, a part of the Lighthouse where the humans traded things. There they learned that the Kree ruled the Lighthouse and the Humans had no hope of overthrowing them because of a lack of weapons and technology. Coulson requested that Tess visit Virgil's room to see if it contained clues regarding the presence of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the future. While there, Coulson learned how little Tess knew about life on the now destroyed Earth, as she mixed up factual and fictional things. Coulson eventually found a notebook hidden by Virgil, and kept it.

Coulson and Tess then returned to the Exchange, and learned that Simmons had been taken by the Kree Watch. They shared the news with Daisy Johnson, Yo-Yo Rodriguez and Alphonso Mackenzie.  Coulson agreed to let Johnson follow Deke Shaw to gain information about Simmons' whereabouts, while the rest of the group tried to steal a Kree tablet. Coulson broke a pipe, releasing steam, which distracted the Kree guards, enabling Rodriguez to steal the tablet.

Coulson bargains with Grill
As a Renewal was held in the Lighthouse, Coulson knew that he and his team would be in trouble, since they had no Metrics implanted in their wrists. Coulson went to Grill, the manager of Salvage he had previously encountered with Tess, and offered to trade the tablet in exchange of installing Metrics in their wrists. Grill wanted more for the service. He demanded that Coulson, Rodriguez and Mackenzie work for him, to which Coulson agreed. Coulson had his Metric implanted, but they soon realized that Grill had rigged the Metrics so he could pin them against the wall, as he intended to let Holt kill them.

Coulson was saved by May and Tess, who eventually killed Holt to make sure that a life was paid to the Kree. When the Kree Watch arrived, Coulson showed them his Metric, but the guard noticed that it had not been conventionally formatted. Grill kept the team out of trouble by assuring the guards that Coulson and his friends worked for him. From that moment, Coulson was forced to work in Salvage with Mackenzie and Rodriguez.

A Mysterious Signal
While working for Grill, Coulson saw Alphonso Mackenzie trying to force open the door of their boss's office. Although he failed, Coulson learned that Grill was keeping the Kree tablet they had traded him, along with a gun, in a closet and decided that Yo-Yo Rodriguez should try to steal it. Inspired by this recon mission, Coulson asked Tess and Melinda May to take him with them on their next journey aboard the Trawler. Tess agreed and Coulson and Mackenzie were enlisted for the next run.

Coulson explained to Tess that he believed Virgil had identified something of interest in a fragment of the destroyed Earth labeled "Segment 616". Coulson insisted it was important they learn what Virgil had been planning and that they needed to go explore the segment. Tess reluctantly agreed. However, the mission was rendered much more difficult when Zev, Grill's right-hand man, was sent along. He suspected the group of stealing from Grill.

Once in space, Coulson asked May how she was feeling, and May admitted she was growing tired of their uninterrupted missions. Coulson comforted her by putting his hand on her shoulder. Coulson hypothesized that they could be trapped in the future forever, although May refused to let him be so fatalistic. When they were facing the destroyed planet, Tess took out the miniature globe she had taken from Virgil's room. Coulson realized that it contained a small knob that opened a panel on the Trawler, revealing a radio station Virgil was likely using to communicate with someone.

Coulson was discovered by Zev, who pinned everyone against the walls of the spaceship using their wrist Metrics. May managed to knock over Zev by rocking the ship and Mackenzie incapacitated him, enabling Coulson to be released. By manipulating the radio, Coulson was able to receive a signal that originated on the surface of the Earth and was bounced off fragment 616. They were unable to establish communication but Coulson recorded the message they were receiving. Mackenzie and Tess argued over whether they should kill Zev, by dumping him in space, in order to cover for their mission.

Zev had cut the Trawler's fuel lines, forcing the group to return to the Lighthouse, where Grill confronted them about the mission they had gone on behind his back. Coulson and the others risked being reported to the Kree Watch, but were eventually saved when Rodriguez planted the gun she had stolen from Grill's office in Zev's jacket, making Grill believe Zev was the actual traitor. Coulson was able to keep working on the radio signal he had recorded. He eventually discovered that there were people surviving on the surface of the Earth who had been in contact with Virgil. Tess doubted that was possible because the Earth was infested with Vrellnexians.

Deke Shaw's Betrayal
Back at the Salvage, Coulson learned from Melinda May that all Trawler flights had been cancelled. He and the rest of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents  discussed the recent disappearance of Daisy Johnson, but their conversation was ended by Grill who accused them of working too slowly. As Alphonso Mackenzie was instructed by Grill to recover a debt from Gunner, Coulson used the information he had been given about level 35 of the Lighthouse to plan an infiltration mission to try and find some Kree technology they could use.

Coulson and May went to see Deke Shaw. Since he was the last person they knew that had been in contact with Johnson, they asked him about her whereabouts. Shaw replied that she had decided to go dark and that she was still trying to rescue Jemma Simmons from Kasius. Coulson asked Shaw's assistance in entering level 35, but Shaw was reluctant due to the danger of such an operation. Coulson then played the radio message he had recorded earlier, which convinced Shaw, since he had believed that the people speaking in the message were dead.

Coulson infiltrates the laboratories
Coulson, May and Shaw took an elevator to level 36. Shaw left the elevator with the help of his Gravity Puck, so he could access level 35 and call the elevator from there. On level 35, Coulson and May discovered Kree laboratories, which Coulson realized were used by the  Kree to artificially breed human babies as part of their harsh population control policy. Coulson was told that this process was used by Kasius hoping to create more Inhumans.

May told Coulson that she had found genetic data regarding Johnson in the lab's systems which had been entered the day before, meaning Shaw had lied to them and had actually delivered Johnson to Kasius. Coulson was willing to let May beat Shaw for his betrayal, but they were interrupted by the arrival of two Kree guards. The three of them fought off the guards, but Shaw was wounded in the process. With reinforcements on the way, May instructed Coulson to take Shaw with him while she remained to fight the fearsome Sinara.

Having tended to Shaw's wound, Coulson interrogated Shaw and accused him of wanting to deliver the survivors on Earth to Kasius as well. Shaw replied by telling Coulson the stories of his parents, and explained that the person talking on the radio message was Shaw's father. Coulson was willing to believe Shaw's story, but required a sign of his good faith. He ordered him to hand over the reward he had obtained from Kasius for turning over Johnson. Coulson then had Mackenzie lock Shaw in his room, as he felt that it would be safer to have Shaw out of the picture.

Flint's Terrigenesis
Coulson told Alphonso Mackenzie and Yo-Yo Rodriguez about what he had found on Level 35. He voiced his concerns that Daisy Johnson might be sold at an Inhuman auction. They were then approached by Tess, who informed them that the Kree Watch were gathering teenagers to undergo Terrigenesis. Among those selected was Flint, a young boy who had lost his parents in a Renewal, and Coulson advised Tess to go and talk to Flint to comfort him. As the ceremony proceeded, Flint was enveloped in a husk. However, when it cracked open, Flint was not inside.

Coulson quickly figured out that Flint had been taken to safety by Rodriguez, using her superhuman speed. Coulson, Mackenzie and Tess found them both in the Salvage. Tess left with Flint, planning to hide him in the Trawler. Coulson remained in the Salvage, listening to Rodriguez's story of her own Terrigenesis. However, they were interrupted by Grill, who had overheard everything and pinned them down, planning to deliver both Flint and Rodriguez to Kasius to be sold.

Coulson attempted to talk Grill out of it, referring to how they seemed to fulfil the prophecy about S.H.I.E.L.D. agents coming from the past to help Humans. Grill dismissed this as nonsense and still intended to turn them over to Kasius. As the situation grew more intense, Flint's geokinesis manifested and he began hurling rocks at Grill. Eventually, through his powers, he created a massive boulder which he hurled at Grill, killing him. Coulson and the others hid with Grill's body in his office to avoid the Kree Watch.

Coulson and Mackenzie eventually left the office, looking for Tess so they could smuggle Flint onto the Trawler. They soon discovered that Tess had already been found and murdered by the Kree Watch.

Escape from the Lighthouse
The Vicar ordered the human population of the Lighthouse to disclose any information they had on the whereabouts of S.H.I.E.L.D. or Flint. Coulson and Alphonso Mackenzie returned to the Salvage and attempted to keep the news of Tess' death from Flint, but were soon forced to tell him. The group was then rejoined by Daisy Johnson and Jemma Simmons, who had escaped from Kasius, along with Deke Shaw and, Leo Fitz, who had found a way to join his friends in the future.

Coulson fights Maston-Dar
Noticing that Flint had disappeared, Coulson went to look for him with Mackenzie and Johnson, and learned Flint had been captured by Sinara, after murdering the Vicar. Coulson shot at Sinara multiple times then was attacked by Maston-Dar, another fearsome Kree warrior. With Mackenzie's help, Coulson escaped from Maston-Dar, while Johnson rescued Flint. All of them then retreated back to the Salvage, where they discussed the possibility of reaching the surface of the Earth with the Trawler.

Coulson and the team discuss their way out
Since Sinara and Maston-Dar were still in pursuit, Coulson and his team returned to the Salvage and blocked the door. Flint used his powers to reinforce the barricade with boulders, but Maston-Dar used a weapon to blow holes in the walls. Shaw was able to use his Gravity Puck to move everyone to the Trawler's landing bay. When they all reached the ship, Coulson realized that Shaw could not fly it. He asked Flint whether he could, but Flint opted to remain in the Lighthouse to protect the humans. Mackenzie and Yo-Yo Rodriguez volunteered to stay behind and help him. Coulson agreed.

Coulson struggles to fly the Trawler
Coulson and the rest of the team boarded the Trawler. With no one else to fly the spacecraft, Coulson opted to pilot it himself, joking that it shouldn't be much different than driving Lola.  In reality, flying the Trawler was harder than Coulson anticipated, although he managed to maneuver the spaceship above the Earth.

Future Earth
Looking for Answers
Coulson could not prevent the Trawler from crashing to Earth, although no one was hurt in the brutal landing. The team was rescued by a group of True Believers led by Samuel Voss, who took them to their base located on the wreckage of Zephyr One. There, Coulson and the others were reunited with Melinda May, who told Coulson that more mysteries had surfaced. Earlier, May had been welcomed by an elderly Robin Hinton, an Inhuman the agents had known as a little girl in their own timeline.

Coulson speaks with Robin Hinton
Coulson and May went to talk with Hinton, after Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons failed to get answers on their own. Coulson asked Hinton what S.H.I.E.L.D. was supposed to do, but she gave cryptic answers. She then spoke Coulson's full name and said he was the only one who could bring all the pieces together, before grabbing his hand and saying this was the day when all ended. Unable get anything more from Hinton, Coulson went to see Daisy Johnson to brief her. He also instructed her to see Fitz and Simmons to remove her Inhuman Control Device.

Coulson and May returned to Hinton, asking her about Alphonso Mackenzie and Yo-Yo Rodriguez, but got no answers. They asked Enoch for help, but the Chronicom admitted that in the past it had taken several days to get answers from Robin. As he and May discussed their plans, Coulson was approached by Hinton, who handed him a new drawing of Zephyr One flying into space.

Coulson and May went to see Voss to review the True Believers' armory, where they found a fragment of the Time Di'Alla, the artefact which had sent them into the future. Although Voss told them that no one had been able to find any other piece of the monolith, Coulson brought the shard to Fitz and Simmons, who inferred that it fit into an Isochronus Cyclotron built by Owen Shaw. To get more information on this new lead, Coulson instructed Johnson to speak with Hinton.

Later, Coulson and May realized that the True Believers were turning on them. Voss planned on preventing them from returning to their own time, as he believed Quake was responsible for the Destruction of Earth. Coulson fought his way to Johnson, who was defending herself against Voss and two True Believers. Coulson helped Johnson defeat Voss, but couldn't stop him from killing Hinton to prevent her form giving S.H.I.E.L.D. any further help. Coulson and the team mourned her death, then May announced that one of Hinton's drawings pointed to the answer: Flint was the key to returning to their own timeline.

Taking the Zephyr in Space
Coulson talked with Enoch about using Flint's geokinetic powers to rebuild a Time Di'Alla so that the team could return home. That meant that they had to take Zephyr One into space, despite the gravity storms. The Chronicom instead advised that they take shelter in the caverns and wait for the storms to subside. Still, Coulson had his team ready Zephyr One for space travel, although that proved to be quite challenging due to the damage the plane had sustained.

Coulson talks with Daisy Johnson
Coulson then went to see Melinda May and asked her how she felt after Robin Hinton's death, knowing that in the alternate timeline, May had actually raised Hinton as her own daughter. Coulson assured May that he had no problem believing that May could have been a mother. He also told the team that he would let Deke Shaw decide of Samuel Voss' fate. Later, while reloading his prosthetic hand, Coulson discussed with Daisy Johnson having her Inhuman Control Device removed. Johnson preferred to leave it in place, as she feared that her powers could be the source of the Destruction of Earth.

Coulson then rejoined his team as they prepared the plane for takeoff, noticing that Shaw had returned after choosing to spare Voss' life. The team attempted to fire up the engines, but they malfunctioned, pinning the plane on the ground. Coulson was willing to follow Enoch's idea of going into the caves, until Jemma Simmons came up with the idea of allowing the gravity storm take them to space and then using the new Gravitonium-based thrusters of the plane to fly. Coulson agreed to this plan.

Coulson contacts Alphonso Mackenzie
Despite the anchors malfunctioning, and Coulson being mildly injured due to brutal turbulence, Zephyr One was eventually released from the surface of the Earth thanks to the team's efforts and the violence of the gravity storm, enabling May to pilot Zephyr One in space. Coulson then instructed Johnson to make contact with Alphonso Mackenzie in the Lighthouse. Once Mackenzie replied, Coulson informed him of their return and asked him whether Flint was still with him.

Back to the Lighthouse
Coulson fights the Kree Watch
Coulson and his team returned to the Lighthouse using Zephyr One's Containment Module. They left the plane to be inspected by the Kree Watch while they entered the building. Coulson made sure  Enoch was safe after leaving him behind to prepare the Isochronus Cyclotron, then he instructed Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons to find Flint and give him the shard of the Time Di'Alla they had brought. Meanwhile, Coulson, Melinda May, Deke Shaw and Daisy Johnson attacked a group of Kree soldiers who were guarding Inhumans, in order to save the Inhumans and get them to the Trawler.

Remaining with Johnson, Coulson was attacked by an Odium-empowered Tye. Coulson shot him repeatedly with his I.C.E.R., but Tye was impervious to its effect and threw Coulson against the wall. Tye was eventually defeated and killed by Johnson, enabling Coulson to reach the Trawler's bay where they were reunited with Tess, who had been resurrected, like Coulson, by Kree blood. Coulson expressed sympathy towards Tess, assuring her that her second chance at life would be worth it.

Leaving the Inhumans with Tess, Coulson was contacted by Enoch. The Chronicom informed him that the Kree had found him and that he only had minutes before the Kree Watch attacked and ruined S.H.I.E.L.D.'s chances to return to their own time. Shaw offered to return to Zephyr One. Coulson warned him that he would be at a heavy disadvantage, but Shaw insisted, saying all the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents had to survive, so Coulson agreed to let him go.

Coulson had Johnson hack into an elevator so they could reach Kasius' suites, where they planned to create the Monolith. Johnson revealed that she wanted to remain in the 2091 Lighthouse, as she feared her powers might be the cause of the Destruction of Earth if she returned. Coulson refused to respect her decision, stating that he needed Johnson to lead S.H.I.E.L.D. one day. Knowing he could not change her mind, Coulson incapacitated her with his I.C.E.R. before taking her to the suites.

Coulson waits for the activation of the Time Di'Alla
In the suites, Coulson and May were reunited with Fitz and Simmons, who had found Flint. Alphonso Mackenzie told Coulson that Yo-Yo Rodriguez had briefly left. Coulson then watched as Flint used his geokinesis to create the Time Di'Alla S.H.I.E.L.D needed to return to their own time. Coulson called Shaw to inform him the Monolith was ready and he congratulated Shaw for his help. Noticing that Mackenzie was missing after leaving to look for Rodriguez, Coulson agreed to let Simmons go look for them. Taking Johnson in his arms, Coulson then waited for the Time Di'Alla to be activated, sending him back to his own timeline.

Return to the Present
Infiltration into St. Louis Facility
Coulson and his team materialized, finding themselves still in the Lighthouse. They were afraid Flint's monolith hadn't worked, but Leo Fitz realized they had traveled back in time, just in the same place. Their appearance in the Lighthouse triggered an automated orientation video of General Rick Stoner. They learned from the video that the Lighthouse was built by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a secret emergency bunker. Coulson stated there was nothing about it in Nick Fury's Toolbox. He then told Alphonso Mackenzie to have his injuries looked at, but Coulson refused medical attention himself, saying he wanted to remain with Daisy Johnson, because she would have questions upon waking.

The orientation video that had been playing in the background mentioned a storage facility in the basement, where they also kept all the state-of-the-art tech. Coulson sent Melinda May there, telling her they needed communications. May left, taking Fitz with her. Coulson was alone in the room with Daisy when she woke up complaining that he had I.C.E.'d her. She looked around and asked if they had made it home. Coulson replied that there was no universe in which he would have left her behind.

Meanwhile, in the basement, May and Fitz were startled to find three monoliths and a Chronicom named Noah. Noah explained that the Lighthouse was a safe place to store unsafe items. Noah led Fitz and May to a room from which he had been monitoring Earth. May was alarmed by what she saw on one of the monitors and called Coulson to come have a look. Coulson came and saw the video feed of an unusual beam of light coming out of the sky. He feared it was what Samuel Voss had warned him about in the future. Coulson learned that the light beam was focused on a spot in St. Louis, Missouri, and determined they needed to go there immediately and investigate.

The team needed to get to the cloaked Zephyr One without being spotted, because they were fugitives being sought by General Hale and her task force. Noah directed them to a secret tunnel that emerged in the town of River's End, not far from the Lighthouse. Johnson stayed behind, out of fear her powers would cause the Destruction of Earth, and the others set out. When they arrived in River's End, they all paused to smell the fresh air and feel the sunshine, relishing being back in their own time.

Coulson had Mackenzie break into and hotwire a 1975 Volkswagen van that was parked with a for sale sign in the window. In order to get Mackenzie's cooperation, Coulson had to promise they would return the van when they were done with it. While driving through town, a police car flashed its lights and siren at them. The agents were nervous but the officer thought they had purchased the van and only wanted to comment on it.

They arrived at Zephyr One without further incident. Onboard, Coulson inquired of May how she was feeling. May quipped that she had never loved gravity more. Coulson groaned and doubled over in obvious pain. May advised him to have Simmons check him out. Coulson again declined medical attention, saying it was only a headache. Simmons and Fitz approached with information. They had pinpointed the location of the beam of light. They informed Coulson it was at Aerospace Industry's laboratory, and the light was not coming down from the sky, but emanating from the lab. It was the Kree Orb Hive had used to call the Kree to Earth.

Arriving at the laboratory, Coulson fired his weapon at the door to gain entry. Inside, the building appeared deserted. They found a literal firewall and Fitz scanned for signs of life, detecting someone beyond the firewall. They opened the door with guns drawn and found Piper pointing a gun at them. Piper explained that she had searched everywhere for Coulson and his team, had spotted the beacon, and went there to warn the laboratory staff. While she was there, the Orb had activated and the staff couldn't shut it down, so she sent everyone away for their safety. 

Fitz was easily able to dismantle the Kree Orb and remove a timer that looked manmade. At that point, Piper drew her gun on the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and a group of armed individuals in masks and tactical uniforms walked through the door. They were followed by a woman in a mask and leather catsuit, whom they later learned was Ruby Hale. Coulson turned to Piper and commented, "You cut a deal." Piper admitted it, saying she was most wanted too. The armed men ordered the agents to drop their weapons and they complied. Coulson asked Piper why she did it. She stated that when Hale picked her up, she had thought Coulson and his team were dead. Piper told Hale everything she knew about Anton Ivanov, Holden Radcliffe, LMDs and the Framework. She went along with the trap because Hale had guaranteed the S.H.I.E.L.D. team would not be harmed, just arrested.

Ruby Hale ordered her men to kill the S.H.I.E.L.D. team. Yo-Yo Rodriguez used her Inhuman speed to disarm the men, then May engaged them hand-to-hand. Rodriguez and Mackenzie joined the melee. Coulson questioned Piper about General Hale guaranteeing their safety, and Piper realized that Hale had lied. Mackenzie shot one of the men in the face, revealing electric circuitry. He realized Hale's men were actually Sleeper Mechs. While they watched the fight from the inner room, Coulson kept needling Piper, trying to get her back on his side. Piper finally relented and offered to cover Coulson. They moved to the outer room, shooting at Hale's robots.

During the fight, Ruby Hale threw one of her Chakram at Rodriguez, severing both her arms. Mackenzie grabbed Rodriguez; the team took the Kree Orb and they quickly retreated to the Lighthouse where Jemma Simmons went to work attending to Rodriguez's injuries. In a different room, Coulson and the others awaited word of Rodriguez's condition.
