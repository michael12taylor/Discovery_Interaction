<html><p>Looking for answers, Murdock found Paul Lantom at a bar and asked if his old friend knew about Grace being his mother. Murdock realized that Lantom knew about the secret and demanded to know why he would keep that a secret from him during his childhood, when he needed family the most. Lantom stated that he wished that Grace would tell Murdock the truth herself, but Murdock harshly retorted that she didn't visit him or comforted him when his father died. Lantom told the history to Murdock about how Grace and Jack met and how after being afflicted with postpartum depression she left them to return back to the church. After listening to the story and still angry for his mentor's hypocrisy about truth, Murdock left the bar. After briefly returning back to the church and retrieve what he had, Murdock took refuge at Fogwell's Gym.

Daredevil screams at a imagination of Kingpin
Not long after, he received a phone call from Nadeem who warned him to be ready because Fisk was planning something. While in solitude inside the gym, Murdock imagined having a conversation with his father, Jack. In his mind, he confronted his father about both of his parents leaving him, accusing him of choosing his own pride over being with his son, while his imagined father tried to make him forgive his mother. Murdock then decided he wouldn't let people get hurt over a moral code anymore and declared that he was going to kill Fisk. Later during the day, Murdock received a phone call from Nadeem who gave him the address to Fisk's location. As he continued to have his conversation with his father, his imagined conversation turned darker when his father was replaced by Fisk who began taunting him. In his mind, Murdock killed Fisk by snapping his neck.

Leaving the gym, instead of heading to the location where Nadeem has texted, Murdock headed to the hotel instead. Shutting down the light of the hotel and avoiding Fisk's guards, Daredevil entered Fisk's penthouse and found a secret stair leading to a surveillance room. Finding Shelby and reassuring her that he wasn't there to kill her, he asked her when Fisk will return and was informed that he will return soon. Before Daredevil could prepare, he heard from the radio that Karen Page was located at Clinton Church and he learned from Shelby that Fisk wants her killed.

Deeply conflicted about his desire to kill Fisk and to protect Page, Daredevil wrestled with his choice. Shelby warned him that if he leaves now, she must inform Fisk about his appearance and that he will triple the security. After one more moment of hesitation, Daredevil told her to do what she has to do and immediately left the hotel and save Page.

Duel at Clinton Church
Daredevil arrives to fight Benjamin Poindexter
Rushing toward the church, Daredevil arrived just moments after Poindexter began his attack on the innocent participants in the church. He began battling his enemy. However, weakened by his fatigue from reaching the church, Poindexter managed to catch him off guard and momentarily got Daredevil off of him. Using the opening, Poindexter threw his baton at Page. At that moment, Lantom blocked the baton aimed at Page and was impaled by the weapon. Enraged at what Poindexter did to his friend and mentor, Daredevil began furiously beating him. During the fight, he stopped when Lantom used his last words to ask for Murdock's forgiveness before dying. Poindexter used this moment of opening to regain his footing and both combatants continued battling in the church.

Daredevil being comforted by Karen Page
During the battle, Daredevil ensured that Page led the participants out of the church while also preventing any attempts from Poindexter to kill her. Despite Daredevil's superiority in close combat, the protection gained from the suit prevented Daredevil from dealing with any serious damage on his opponent and eventually, Poindexter was able to wear him down. Poindexter managed to get Daredevil off him and continued his pursuit on Page. Daredevil managed to catch up to him at the balcony. Unfortunately, Daredevil was too weakened by his exhaustion to be able to fight his adversary. After knocking Daredevil down to the floor, Poindexter went for the killing blow before he was knocked off the balcony by Page.

Reuniting with Friends
After waking up from being unconscious, Murdock was informed by Page that the authority was coming and that she intended to surrender herself to know and explain the situation. He urged Page not to surrender herself to the authorities as the impostor was an FBI agent and the FBI was working for Fisk. They retreated down to the church basement and Murdock locked the gates. As they hid down the basement, Murdock asked Page about her presence in the church and she revealed that she came to warn him about Fisk knowing his identity. Murdock replied that he already knew and he told Page that he gave up his chance to kill him in order to save her.

Before they could continue, Murdock heard Poindexter and Nadeem approaching the basement. They were forced to hide inside a sarcophagus. Thanks to the diversion of Maggie Grace, they were able to avoid getting caught. They continued their discussion as they waited for the FBI to leave. Murdock learned about Page's failed plan to provoke Fisk at his penthouse and she revealed that she killed James Wesley. Murdock admitted his own plan to kill Fisk. Page approached and urged Murdock not to go through with it. Having experienced it before, Page advised him not to tread that path as that would change everything about him and that he could never atone from it.

Not long afterwards, they were approached by Grace who has come to help them. Still hurt by his mother's past choices, Murdock made an effort to reconnect with her. More problems came when Murdock sensed that the FBI brought in search dogs. While Grace diverted the FBI away, Page confronted Murdock about his tendency to wall himself off from everyone. While they argued, she reminded him that despite his recent behavior toward Foggy Nelson, his friend is still willing to stand by him. Realizing that they could use Nelson's assistance, he called him. Devising a plan together with Nelson, they planned to use Nelson to help surrender Page to the NYPD under Brett Mahoney who wasn't under Fisk's influence. While listening to the plan coming to fruition, Murdock heard Nadeem advising Mahoney to take Page far away from the FBI, thus Murdock realized that he was trustworthy and that his action put him in danger.

Murdock with Karen Page and Foggy Nelson
Meeting with Page and Nelson afterward, Murdock apologized to his friends about the way he treated them. They began discussing what to do next. Murdock remained adamant that killing Fisk was the only way to put him down for good while Nelson maintained his faith in the system. Eventually, Murdock agreed to Nelson's plan to use the law against Fisk. Knowing that Nadeem had everything to lose and that he was now being hunted by Fisk, Murdock immediately went to save him. Arriving at Nadeem's residence just when Fisk's men attacked Nadeem, Daredevil quickly dispatch the attackers. Nadeem held Daredevil at gunpoint, not believing that he was there to help him after he betrayed him. Daredevil admitted that he's trusting Nadeem and that he was grateful that he helped saving Page. As a sign of trust to convince him, Daredevil pulled off his mask and revealed his identity.

Protecting Agent Nadeem
Once again working together with Nelson as lawyers, they made sure that Nadeem and his family got to safety at Brett Mahoney's residence. They used Fogwell's Gym as a temporary office and hideout. While they waited for Nelson to arrive with Blake Tower, Murdock confronted Nadeem about allowing Fisk to leave prison and letting himself be corrupted despite his morals. When Nadeem defended his action that Fisk's intel saved lives, Murdock furiously replied that it only allowed Fisk to reclaim his power. He further confronted Nadeem about his inaction when his boss killed an agent or he didn't intervene when Poindexter murdered Paul Lantom. Nadeem admitted his mistake and was remorseful that his action caused him to lose his family and life. Softened, Murdock urged Nadeem to tell that to Tower. Soon after, Nelson arrived with Tower and they begin negotiating.

After listening to Nadeem, Tower stated that he could convene a special grand jury on the current day. However, despite Murdock and Nelson's attempts to defend Nadeem's actions, Tower refused to grant him immunity and the best offer he could give was five years. Nadeem agreed to Tower's term and to testify for the jury. While Nadeem called his son, Nelson expressed his desire to work together with Murdock again to which Murdock agreed.

Murdock and Ray Nadeem escape assassins
Soon NYPD came to escort Nadeem to the courthouse. Murdock decided to go with him. Using a disguised van as their transport, they headed to the courthouse. Along the way, they were ambushed by Fisk's agents. With their driver killed by the initial gunfire, Murdock and Nadeem were forced to fight through their attackers. Using his enhanced senses for any approaching attackers, Murdock guided Nadeem as they fought off their attackers. After dispatching their attackers, they used an abandoned cab to head toward the courthouse.

Getting Nadeem to the courthouse, Murdock and his friends could only wait for the jury to make their judgment. Unfortunately, despite their efforts, Fisk had already prepared for this. Murdock heard the juror being threatened by having one of them begin reciting their addresses. With their lives being threatened, the juror has elected not to indict Fisk. Defeated, Murdock and his allies try to find another way to stop Fisk. However, while Murdock was out to talk to Tower, Nadeem made his escape. Later at night while they were at Fogwell's Gym, they learned from Mahoney that Nadeem was killed. Furious that their plan failed and the failure of the system, Murdock left his friends at the gym and intend to pursue his original plan to murder Fisk.

Kidnapping of Felix Manning
Daredevil confronting Felix Manning
In order to get to Fisk, Daredevil pursued Felix Manning and managed to catch him. At night, he aggressively interrogates him and learned that Fisk planned to have a wedding with Vanessa Marianna and to charm Hell's Kitchen into loving him again. Through Manning, Daredevil learned that Marianna ordered the murder of Nadeem. He also claimed that he could testify that Fisk ordered the deaths of Winn and Julie Barnes. Learning about Barnes and her connection to Benjamin Poindexter, Daredevil found a way to turn him against Fisk.

Daredevil brutally questioning Felix Manning
Stealing Manning's phone, he used that to call Poindexter the next day. Using all the knowledge that he has gained from listening to Eileen Mercer's tapes and Barnes's connection to Poindexter, Daredevil was able to lure Poindexter to the disclose location where he Barnes' corpse was located and was able to convince Poindexter that Fisk had her killed. Having successfully convinced Poindexter to turn against Fisk, Daredevil prepared his assault.

Battle at Presidential Hotel
Daredevil arriving at the Presidential Hotel
Using Poindexter to pave the way for him, Daredevil followed him until they finally reached Fisk who was at the dance floor with Marianna. He arrived in time to prevent Poindexter from killing Marianna. The wedding erupted into chaos. While Fisk and Marianna quickly retreated, Daredevil pursued them as Poindexter found himself occupied with fending off Fisk's corrupted FBI agents. Heading to the surveillance room, Daredevil quickly dispatch Fisk's men and ordered Shelby to shut down the elevators so they couldn't stop him.

Daredevil refuses to actually kill Wilson Fisk
Heading up the stairs leading to Fisk's penthouse, Daredevil finally faced his hated enemy, emerging into a furious fight inside the penthouse. While they fought, Poindexter arrived at the penthouse. His arrival turned the fight into a brutal three-way struggle. During the fight, Daredevil protected Marianna from Poindexter's attacks to kill her while also fighting off both Kingpin and Poindexter. Eventually, Poindexter was defeated when Kingpin broke his back. Now facing each other alone, both nemesis immediately resumed their battle. Having gained more experienced and battle-hardened since their last fight, Daredevil managed to defeat the Kingpin. Having him at his mercy, Daredevil began brutally beating his enemy. Marianna pleaded for Daredevil not to kill him. Daredevil held Kingpin's neck but barely managed to stop himself from snapping his neck and stopped his assault.

Daredevil makes his new deal with Wilson Fisk
Kingpin warned him that he will never stop hunting Karen Page and Foggy Nelson and he will tell the world who Daredevil really is. Daredevil realized that Kingpin wanted him to kill him. His enemy stated that no prison can hold him and once again baited him to kill him. Daredevil defied his attempts to taunt him and refused to take the bait. Despite his desire to kill him, Daredevil firmly stated that his enemy will never destroy who he is. Finally regaining his conviction and beliefs in the law, Murdock declared his victory over his adversary and that Kingpin will spend the rest of his life in prison. Showing his face and defiance to Fisk, Murdock warned Fisk to stop hunting his friends and to keep his secret, otherwise, he will make sure that Marianna will spend the rest of her life in prison for ordering the death of Nadeem. Defeated, Kingpin agreed to the deal with Daredevil.

Soon Brett Mahoney arrived to arrest Kingpin. They also arrested Poindexter and Mahoney made sure that the police knew that he was an impostor. From atop the hotel, Daredevil observed as Kingpin and his agents got taken away by the authorities.

A Man Without Fear
Murdock talking with his Mom at Paul Lantom's funeral
Days passed, the day for Paul Lantom's funeral arrived. Murdock took the time to privately speaking with his mother. He told her about his last conversation with Lantom and regretted the word he said to his old friend. He told her about Lantom's last plead to forgive them. Murdock further told his mother about how he was angry at God for blinding him and giving him so much pain. But he admitted that despite his hardship, it was the same life that turned him into Daredevil and he wouldn't have been able to save people. Murdock forgave his mother and asked her to guide him when he needed her. To which, Grace accepted.

Murdock giving a Speech at Paul Lantom's funeral
During Lantom's funeral, Murdock held a eulogy to his friend. Murdock spoke about the people present for Lantom's funeral and expressed how the priest influenced so many people. Murdock talked about the ideas that Lantom spread to Hell's Kitchen about helping the community and the people within it. He talked about how he stood up against someone who used fear as a tool to hurt people. Murdock expressed his admiration for his old mentor and urged everyone to live by his example; to be a man without fear.

Nelson, Murdock and Page
Murdock, Page and Nelson celebrating at Nelson's Meats
After the funeral, Murdock headed to Nelson's Meats to spend a day having awake there with Nelson and Page. Murdock informed his friends that he intends to move back into his apartment and return back to work as a lawyer. Excited, Nelson wrote on a napkin and proposed that their new firm will be called Nelson, Murdock and Page. Both Murdock and Page agreed to their friend's proposal. With his life reclaimed, his reputation restored and his adversary back in prison, Murdock looked forward to a life working with his friends.

Personality
Matt Murdock, for lack of a better term, is complicated. As a child, he felt immense guilt and loss: blaming himself for the death of his father as well as feeling lost after losing his sight. He was both heroic and selfless even as a child, as was shown best when he saved an elderly man from being hit by a truck, at the cost of his own vision. Murdock has "daddy issues" with both his actual father Jack Murdock and his subsequent father figure Stick, having lost both either to death or from being abandoned. Stick tried to raise him to be coldblooded but suddenly abandoned him when Matt started expressing filial affection; this abandonment and rejection has left Murdock with difficulty forging real emotional connections, despite his determination to not let Stick define him. Though it is evident that by the time of meeting the rest of the Defenders that he was starting to open up and accept help from others. This was also proven when he asked Danny Rand to protect his city before his apparent death.

Murdock has a high desire for justice and doing the right thing. He convinced his friend Foggy Nelson to quit their internship at Landman and Zack to start their own firm which would work for the common man. During the start of their firm, he aimed to help only innocent people. Unable to allow injustice, he got frustrated when the police or judicial system failed to help. He decided to work as a vigilante to save people and help where the justice system could not. During this, he demonstrated extreme selflessness as he kept risking his life for others, even after he barely made it out of dangerous situations and ended up badly wounded multiple times.

While fighting crime, he can be very brutal and heavily injures criminals in such a manner as breaking their bones. He has hospitalized multiple criminals in this regard, with the first man he beat up having to eat through a straw for a month. However, he has avoided intentionally killing anyone so far and limits himself to hand to hand combat and sticks so as to not inflict lethal injuries, even if this results in himself getting injured during fights. When the Steel Serpent warehouse started burning, he used a gun to try and scare everyone into leaving and ordered a downed guard to evacuate them, showing great concern for even his enemies, as both the guards and the workers there had attacked him. He usually attempts to avoid killing people, and has yet to kill anyone so far, as he believes he's on thin ice as it is and that doing so will make him no better than the people he's fighting. His refusal to kill earns him heavy criticism from Frank Castle, who kills criminals without hesitation or remorse and considers Matt a coward who can't finish the job. Matt believes that the people he's up against deserve a second chance, to try again. As he believes that there is goodness in people.

Despite his reluctance to kill, Matt has, on occasion, when sufficiently infuriated or when the situation is dire, thrown away his concern for the well-being of his opponents, such as when he used a kitchen knife when Semyon came for him, tortured him with it and even threw him off of a rooftop, though he knew he would live because of the dumpster positioned under where Semyon fell. The harming or killing of innocent people, such as Elena Cardenas, makes him even more willing to kill, as he told Elena's killer that he would not stop beating him if he did not go to the police.

Later on, his fight with Nobu Yoshioka resulted in the latter's accidental immolation and apparent death, though he was angry when he learned that Wilson Fisk actually wanted Nobu to die and did not lift a finger to save him when he had the chance. When the resurrected Yoshioka ended up killing Elektra, his resulting ferocity made him able to easily beat Yoshioka and knock him off a building with a wire from his billy club, seemingly not caring if Nobu came back to life or not. He has also threatened to kill Wilson Fisk and has acknowledged that he meant it at the time, while he also did slash Fisk with one of Yoshioka's discarded blades, only to find that his suit was concealing body armor. So far he has been lucky that during these lapses in his sense of morality he has failed to follow through on his intent, however, even his temporary willingness to kill still feeds his sense of guilt when he reflects on it.

His most complex relationship is arguably is the one with Elektra. When Elektra first reentered his life, Matt was not best pleased to see her, as the two had parted on less than favorable terms. Before long, he began to consider her a nuisance, due to her constantly involving him in her battles with the Hand, when he already had his hands full dealing with the Frank Castle case. He had to tell her that his life didn't stop every time she called him. Over time, however, he got more and more involved in her struggle, and his relationships with Karen and Foggy became more distant as a result. Eventually, he came to realize that he actually loves Elektra and that she makes him more alive than anything else. Eventually, these feelings would lead Matt to re-enter the collapsing Midland Circle caves in an attempt to rescue her, but ultimately was unable to do so and was nearly killed as a result of being crushed under the rubble.

As a Catholic, Murdock experiences a lot of guilt and soul-searching over his actions when he allows his anger and contempt for violent criminals to cause him to enjoy beating them bloody, and he frequently wonders whether he is doing the right thing in the eyes of God or whether he is allowing evil into his heart. When he feels this way, he approaches his local priest, Father Paul Lantom, for spiritual guidance and advice, however, he asks his questions in a roundabout way to conceal his identity as Daredevil, though Lantom has managed to figure out the truth. Either way, Lantom is bound by the seal of confession not to divulge what they discuss. After Murdock met his mentor Stick again, he started to doubt his ways and even considered killing Wilson Fisk as he doubted he could stop him any other way. This created an internal struggle as his best friend and others did not want him to act as a vigilante. In the final confrontation against Fisk, he kept true to his vow and ultimately did not kill Fisk.

His vigilante activities have also been the source of his falling out with Karen, Claire, and Foggy and throughout the series have caused problems between him and the latter. For a time he even retires as Daredevil trying to work as an independent lawyer and receiving outsourced work from Nelson to keep him busy. This was after the Hand's return and the formation of the Defenders, he comes to embrace and defend his life as a crime-fighting vigilante; evident when Page commented that he was just getting his life back to which he replied, "This is my life, Karen."

After Midland Circle had collapsed on him and Elektra's disappearance, Murdock starts to forsake the religion he had followed for so long by outwardly expressing that he was no longer fighting for God but rather for himself or that he now understands where him and God stand. While he did berate God directly, he still does prayers and asked for forgiveness although sparingly.  Murdock showed a spiteful attitude to the nun who had tended to him who believed that Murdock had simply lost his faith. He had shoved away all his friends, loved ones, and his own career by not telling anyone of his whereabouts or that he was still alive for a while. These actions have resulted in him embracing his vigilante persona more than ever. Murdock's reluctance to become a lawyer again shows his disbelief in the court system is fair; that sometimes people can get away from their crimes if they are that powerful. It enhances his rationale that killing off Fisk is the best way to beat because he believes he would just escape prison if he got turned in. But all that in mind, it showed Murdock had been left mentally broken.

Due to the events of Benjamin Poindexter's assault on innocent people and FIsk's domination over the FBI, Murdock realized he needed to be able to trust and rely on others again, especially his friends. He was willing to bring in Fisk through the law suggested by Nelson. It did seem that he was going back to his original self but the death of Ray Nadeem reimbursed his cold tactic to kill Fisk off for the good of the city. But at that when he had the chance to do so, he hesitated and ultimately refused, saying to Fisk that he won't let him destroy who he is. The death of Father Lantom also helped him get back into his religious faith and empowered Murdock to be more like him; to be a man without fear.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Matt Murdock "seeing" the world on fire
Enhanced Senses: Despite being blinded as a child, Matt Murdock's remaining four senses are enhanced to a superhuman level, resulting in them becoming radar-like. He claims to constantly feel numerous things, including balance, direction, minuscule changes in air density, vibrations, and blankets of temperature variations, that are usually imperceptible to human beings. That, combined with his acute hearing and olfactory senses, allows Murdock to evaluate his surroundings in what he describes as an "Impressionistic painting" of the world around him, which, according to him, looks like "the world on fire." His superhumanly enhanced senses grant him tremendous awareness of his surroundings on a wide range, this makes him extremely alert to danger.

Murdock auditorily tracks James Wesley
Enhanced Hearing: Murdock's hearing is sharper than bat's and is extremely acute, he can clearly hear conversations, heartbeats and even breaths from several meters. He was able to hear and memorize the sound of James Wesley's watch ticking, and hear Claire's bones shifting as she breathed. Murdock can focus on what he hears; in a crowded courtroom with the judge speaking, Murdock heard a juror's heartbeat accelerate when James Wesley entered the room. Hearing the changes in people's heartbeats allows Murdock to predict how they feel and what actions they'll take, such as attack or run. He was also able to memorize the pattern of Wesley's watch so he could follow the latter. When forced to improvise while fighting extremely stealthy Hand ninjas, Murdock was able to effectively keep track of their movements by listening to their breaths and the sound of their swords cutting through the air. Murdock's hearing also makes him an adept thief, as he was able to skillfully bypass Benjamin Poindexter's combination safe.
Echolocation: Matt possesses an exceptionally advanced form of human echolocation. He is able to detect objects in his environment by sensing echoes from those objects, by actively creating and listening for sounds - for example tapping his cane, stomping of his enemies' feet, raindrops, ticking from a watch, tumbling of a safe's locks, rattling chains or even a person's heartbeat. He can interpret the sound waves reflected by nearby objects, accurately identifying their location and size.
Lie Detection: Murdock's hearing is so acute, that he can tell whether people are lying or not, based on the rate of their heartbeats.

Lie Detection: Murdock's hearing is so acute, that he can tell whether people are lying or not, based on the rate of their heartbeats.
Enhanced Smell: His incredible olfactory senses which are even sharper than a dog allows him to detect the scent of stale cigarettes and cheap cologne three floors above him and through several walls. When he was a boy, his sense was already so acute, he could smell that an old man sitting at a bench across from him had cancer. By smelling an old cigarette, Murdock could tell that whoever smoked it previously had rotten teeth. He was even able to smell that Foggy Nelson had onions in his lunch, the current time, but two days ago. Matt was able to find The Punisher's secret hideout by following the scent trail of blood, left behind from an injured dog Frank Castle had rescued earlier. 
Enhanced Taste: Murdock was able to tell that Claire Temple had ripped open some of the stitches on her back, due to tasting copper in the air from the blood of her open wound. Stick taught him how to train this sense, which allowed him to pick out every individual ingredient of the ice cream he was eating, including that the milk used came from three different dairy farms, and that the man who served him used a certain type of soil in his garden. From across his apartment, Matt was able to taste the exact brand of alcohol off Karen’s lips, from a drink she had a half an hour ago.
Enhanced Touch: Murdock can feel the presence of those around him through vibrations, air currents, and body temperatures. He can dodge attacks and projectiles by feeling them cut through the air, creating ripples of currents only detectable by him. He locates enemies through walls and from different floors by feeling the vibrations they make from moving, such as their footsteps. While in exile and temporarily powerless, Matt was soon able to feel the vibrations from the subway lines running deep under the church. He used these vibrations to track and scan his environment, and to regain some of his strength and balance.
Enhanced Thermoreception: Matt Murdock can sense changes in heat in the environment. Murdock could even feel the heat generated from the blood spilling from the gunshot wound on Vladimir Ranskahov; to one-half of a degree, he was able to distinguish the difference in temperature.
Electroreception: Murdock is able to detect electric fields, similar to a shark. When out on a mission with Elektra, Murdock was able to find a hidden room by feeling an electrical current coming from behind the wall. He could hear the electricity buzzing inside the wall and felt a stop in the current where the mechanism for unlocking the secret room was. He was also able to find Wilson Fisk's secret room in his hotel room by feeling the electrical current running beneath the floor.

Enhanced Equilibrium: Murdock's sense of balance is superhuman, giving him excellent equilibrium, coordination, dexterity, reflexes, and agility, resulting in high levels of acrobatic and gymnastic ability. His dexterity and reflexes were enhanced even before his training with Stick, as he could effortlessly catch keys thrown to him while hearing the sound they made. He can instinctively react to oncoming blows nearly effortlessly with the use of his other senses, such as avoiding attacks with a sharp weapon at close quarters by hearing the noise of its approach.
Abilities
Murdock fighting against Rance
Master Martial Artist: Despite being blind, Murdock was rigorously trained in martial arts by Stick at a young age, and excelled in it. He continued training himself, despite Stick giving up on him, becoming an exceptionally fit man who is extremely skilled in hand-to-hand combats and martial arts, making him one of the most dangerous and best fighters on the planet. Murdock eventually used his skills to fight crime as the vigilante "Daredevil." Daredevil's fighting style incorporates boxing, muay Thai, wrestling, kung fu, wushu, judo, aikido, capoeira, Jeet Kune Do, Taekwondo, eskrima, silat and ninjutsu. Hence, Daredevil could take down the criminals of Hell's Kitchen with ease, defeating professional hitman Rance, highly skilled assassin John Healy, single-handedly taking down eight Russian gangsters at once (despite having not yet fully recovered from his wounds at the time), and was even able to take down multiple cops while handcuffed. Elektra claimed that Murdock was one of the best fighters that she knew. By the time he met Stick again, Murdock rivaled his former mentor in skill, managing to keep up with him in an intense one-on-one duel and ultimately overpowering him, earning Stick's praise. Though with some difficulty, Murdock was also ultimately able to overpower Wilson Fisk and even flip him through the air during their fight. However, Daredevil would still have problems facing opponents with more combat skills and experience, such as Nobu Yoshioka, though even the latter acknowledged Daredevil as a worthy opponent. Despite his beating at Nobu's hands, he still managed to fight him on near equal grounds and ended the fight by knocking him several feet and accidentally igniting the fuel at his feet, which immolated Yoshioka. A year later, Daredevil seems to haven't lost a step, as he was now able to hold his own against the fierce and extremely dangerous Punisher (even gaining the upper hand against him a few times), to single-handedly take down multiple highly skilled Hand ninjas, to last longer than Elektra against Yoshioka in their final duel, and even to finally defeat the extremely skilled Hand leader himself, albeit only with considerable effort and initial failure. His skill also allowed him to overpower Danny Rand, a master martial artist in his own right. Daredevil was also able to fight both Bakuto and Murakami simultaneously and had the upper hand in the majority of the fight. Daredevil also proved to be the better fighter against Benjamin Poindexter, with the latter having to use his marksman skills to defeat him. Towards the end, he was able to fight Poindexter and Fisk almost simultaneously and defeated the latter with a serious of vicious blows. Daredevil often used his enhanced senses to his advantage in combat, seen when he knocked out the lights while fighting the Dogs of Hell, putting them at a disadvantage during the fight due to their decreased visibility whereas Murdock was not.
Staff Mastery: Thanks to his early training with Stick, Murdock is highly skilled in the use of staves and similar melee weapons. The billy club that Melvin Potter created for him maximizes this skill by being able to easily change between different combinations of weapons.
Chain Mastery: Murdock is highly skilled in using chain for combat, he mainly used it for long range attacks. He was able to use it to fight against the Punisher, successfully disarm and strangle him until he passed out. He also use it to defeat dozens of the members of Dogs of Hell while they are all armed, he was able to use it to smash out the ceiling lights to force the bikers to fight in the darkness, and also being able to use it to disarm their weapons and strangle them to knock them out.
Sword Proficiency: Even though Murdock usually choose to use non-lethal weapons during combat, Murdock is proficient in using a sword. During the Kidnapping of Stick, he was able to disarm and steal the katana from Elektra and held it against her throat, in order to prevent her from joining the Hand. Murdock also briefly used the katana against the Hand ninjas before being disarmed during the fight.
Master Marksman: Because of his enhanced senses, Murdock has an increased awareness of where objects are, allowing him exceptional marksmanship with both firearms and throwing weapons, with him able to quickly knock guns out of the Punisher's grasp with a hurled Billy club. Also, he was able to drop a fire extinguisher on Semyon's head several floors down, timing it perfectly and knowing when Semyon would be off the stairs and directly below it.
Daredevil avoiding Turk Barrett's rounds
Master Acrobat: Murdock is extremely acrobatic, and could already do several agile flips as a child. He is highly skilled with parkour and free-running and able to quickly move over rooftops and climb buildings, managing to keep up with a car this way. Even when handcuffed, Daredevil performed an agile backflip, bringing his hands back in front of his torso. He also utilized his agility to successfully gain the upper hand against Stick. His agility also allowed him to gain the upper hand on the Punisher during their fight. He could even able to use his supreme agility to dodge bullets even at close range.
Master Spy: Murdock is extremely skilled in moving quietly and staying hidden. His agility helps him become hard to find as he clings on to wall corners to stay hidden and hides atop of things and strikes when necessary.
Gifted Intellect: To be added
Master Lawyer: Murdock is a persuasive and trained lawyer, having graduated summa cum laude from Columbia University. Foggy Nelson claimed that had Murdock been able to put more effort into the case of Frank Castle, that they might have won it. When threatening Wilson Fisk, Murdock expressed confidence in his ability to use "every legal loophole and footnote" to keep Fisk and Vanessa Marianna from ever being able to reunite, claiming to have the ability to break him without breaking any law.
Expert Interrogator: Murdock is well adept in interrogation methods, being able to extract information from the criminals of Hell's Kitchen with ease, such as getting information from Felix Manning on Wilson Fisk by dangling him from the edge of a building. He has also notably interrogated Turk Barrett on more than one occasion, as well as Christian Blake.
Expert Tactician: Murdock is a great strategist, he was able to formulate plans which successfully dismantle Fisk's organization and imprison Fisk, and even completely dismantle the Hand which have been established over four hundred years with the help of the Defenders. Murdock is also a skilled leader and he has demonstrated charisma and leadership skills. Murdock was recognized as the leader of the Defenders by Stick, Jessica Jones and eventually Luke Cage and Danny Rand. He successfully led the initial assault on Midland Circle and defeated the Hand.
Physician: As a boy, Murdock would stitch his father's wounds sustained from boxing matches; although his hands were shaky and required whiskey to make his hands more steady. This would later enable him to stitch Elektra's neck wound.
Musician: To some extent in his youth, Murdock is able to play the piano with his enhanced sense of touch to guide him through.
Meditation: To be added
Multilingualism: Murdock speaks fluent English and Spanish, having studied the latter at college. This allowed him to provide translation for Miss Cardenas when Karen could not. However, he cannot speak or understand Russian or Japanese. As a blind person, he learned to read Braille. He also knows some French, able to speak it with Elektra. Murdock identified a mosque choir singing an Arabic song and recognized convicts speaking Albanian.
Equipment
Vigilante Suit: Murdock bought a black suit with red stitching online to wear in his vigilante activities. He also wore a black mask over his head, eyes, and nose, leaving only his mouth uncovered. This suit also had padding which he wore underneath the suit so that the beatings would not hurt as much, but they did not stop him from being seriously injured. He would ultimately discard this suit in favor of a much more durable armored one. Once his senses started to come back, Murdock equipped himself a new black suit at Saint Agnes Orphanage and returned to his vigilante activities, wearing a black mask with white stitching cloth underneath.
Muay Thai Ropes: After his return to vigilantism, while wearing his vigilante suit again, Murdock lost a fight against Benjamin Poindexter. While preparing to kill the Kingpin and possibly confront the fake Daredevil, he started wearing Muay Thai ropes, as he believed that this allowed him to do more damage than boxing wraps.
Former Equipment
Daredevil wearing his armored suit
Armored Suit: In their first fight, after being severely injured by Nobu Yoshioka, Murdock noticed Wilson Fisk's impermeable armored suit and decided to take Claire Temple's advice to get somebody armor of his own. He located Melvin Potter, who made Fisk's suit and persuaded him to make a red and black suit with a facemask and helmet resembling the Christian Devil, leading to his new name. This suit is highly durable, allowing him to be nearly unfazed by an opponent's attacks and recover more quickly from being hit, such as being hit in the head with a metal pipe or slammed into a wall by Fisk. It notably allowed Daredevil to survive unscathed from battling a resurrected Yoshioka with the same Kyoketsu-shoge hook that badly wounded him when he wore his more simple vigilante suit. After his first protective helmet got cracked by a close-range bullet from the Punisher, Daredevil had Potter make him a new, more durable one. The suit's durability is fully displayed at the end of the Defenders when it is revealed that Murdock actually survived the Destruction of Midland Circle, presumably due to the suit's armor. Due to the damages it suffered in the cave-in, Murdock discarded the suit.
Billy Club: When Murdock asked Melvin Potter to create an armored suit for him, Potter also created a special Billy Club. It can be used as a short staff, or two individual sticks joined by a high tensile wire for grappling. It can also be split into two individual short sticks for close-quarters combat. It is kept in a holster on the suit's left thigh.
Murdock preparing to face Nobu Yoshioka
Wooden Sticks: At a young age, Murdock was trained to be an expert stick fighter by Stick, but he stopped using the weapons after Stick left, preferring to fight unarmed. He began using them again at Stick's insistence when his mentor returned to New York City. However, he discarded them after Melvin Potter made him a more advanced Billy Club.
Kyoketsu-Shoge: After defeating Nobu Yoshioka in a duel Daredevil was confronted by Wilson Fisk and the two of them fought. Daredevil was no match for Fisk due to the wounds he sustained from fighting Nobu. During the fight, he tried to cut Fisk using Yoshioka's Kyoketsu-Shoge but Fisk was wearing body armor that protected him. Fisk then disarmed Daredevil and beat him into submission.
Uzi: During the Infiltration into Madame Gao's Warehouse after defeating all the guards and accidentally starting a fire Murdock took this gun from one of the guards and shot at the sprinklers. The water destroyed the drugs in the warehouse and helped combat the fire. With the building burning down, Murdock ordered one of the guards to help the blind workers escape and discarded the weapon on his way out.
Daredevil aiming a revolver at the Dogs of Hell
Smith & Wesson Model 327 Night Guard: The Punisher attached this revolver to Murdock's wrist with duct tape when he kidnapped him and chained him to a chimney on the roof of Jerry's building, ordering him to either shoot and kill him or Grotto and making sure to chamber it with only one bullet. Murdock made his own decision and, using his heightened senses to detect the weakest location of his restraints, fired the only round and broke free. After he incapacitated the Punisher, he attempted to leave Jerry's building but was met by the Dogs of Hell. He caught one member by surprise and threatened to shoot him to ward off the rest of the gangsters, but when they discovered he was empty, he proceeded to beat them up, sometimes using the revolver as a blunt weapon.
Katana: Daredevil stole this weapon from Elektra and held it against her throat in order to prevent her from joining the Hand after she briefly considered joining them during the Kidnapping of Stick. Daredevil convinced Elektra to not join them and to save Stick. Daredevil briefly used the katana against the Hand ninjas before losing it in the fight.
Facilities
Jack Murdock's House: While growing up within New York City, Murdock had lived with his father, Jack Murdock in a small and rundown house, where Murdock had helped his father his the injuries he gained following his boxing matches before being blinded. However, when his dad had been murdered by Roscoe Sweeney following his fight against Carl Creel, Murdock was forced to move out of the House.
Saint Agnes Orphanage: Following his father's death, Murdock was sent to live with nuns, where he had struggled with his enhanced senses from his blinding. Here Murdock first met Stick who promised to take him away and help Murdock understand his abilities.
Murdock and Nelson's dorm room
Columbia University: Having decided that he would become a lawyer, Murdock secured his place at the university where he met his roommate Foggy Nelson before starting a love affair with Elektra. Murdock and Nelson both came out of the University with their degrees and agreed to start a law firm together.
Landman and Zack Building: With their degrees, Murdock and Nelson got jobs working at Landman and Zack, however, Murdock struggled to deal with their effects and suggested to Nelson that they leave the building and the job behind to start their own law firm as they had dreamed of.
Murdock training inside Fogwell's Gym
Fogwell's Gym: Throughout his life, Murdock would often visit Fogwell's Gym for its value as a training ground and as a relic of his father's boxing career. After leaving Saint Agnes' Orphanage, Murdock took refuge in the gym for several days and plotted to kill Wilson Fisk at that time.
Matt Murdock's Apartment: Due to his blindness, Murdock was able to get a good deal with buying a large apartment in the center of New York City. It was next to a large billboard that shone the light directly into the apartment, keeping people awake. Murdock allowed Karen Page to stay at his apartment when she feared she would soon be attacked again by Union Allied Construction. Following his near-fatal beating by Nobu Yoshioka and Wilson Fisk, Murdock made it back to his apartment where he was discovered by Foggy Nelson. Murdock later had let Elektra recover from her injuries there when she had been attacked by the Hand. Murdock's apartment was later ambushed by the Hand, which resulted in Murdock being badly wounded before Elektra saved his life.
Nelson and Murdock Law Office: As they began their work with Nelson and Murdock, the two friends rented an office where Murdock allowed Nelson to take the room which had a view over New York. From here they worked on several of their cases, including Elena Cardenas and Frank Castle until they eventually decided to end their law firm and go their separate ways, locking the door on their offices.
Clinton Church: As he began his career as Daredevil, Murdock often visited the local cathedral in order to receive absolution for his sins and spiritual advice from Paul Lantom. His visits grew much more frequently after the supposed death of Elektra.
