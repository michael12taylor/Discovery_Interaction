Captain Monica Rambeau is the daughter of the late Maria Rambeau. During her childhood, she befriended Carol Danvers, a friend of her mother, and refused to believe the reports that Danvers had died in a mysterious plane crash. Rambeau was amazed and happy when Danvers returned six years later with considerable abilities and convinced her own mother to join Danvers in a mission to help Talos to save Skrull refugees from Kree forces. Before the mission, Rambeau helped Danvers to choose the colors of her outfit which she would later on use as Captain Marvel.

After Danvers returned to space, Maria founded S.W.O.R.D. on Earth. Rambeau eventually followed in her mother's footsteps by joining S.W.O.R.D. in her adult life. In 2018, Monica was killed in the Snap while accompanying her mother for cancer treatments.

Biography
Early Life
Losing Aunt Carol
Rambeau stargazing with Carol Danvers
Rambeau was the daughter of Maria Rambeau. She came to consider her mother's friend, Carol Danvers, as her own family since Danvers did not get along with her parents and spent a lot of time with the Rambeaus. Rambeau and Danvers were very close, to the point that Rambeau called Danvers "Auntie Carol," while Danvers nicknamed her "Lieutenant Trouble." Danvers would stargaze with Rambeau at night in her backyard, telling her stories of the constellations. Over time, Rambeau collected various objects of Danvers' life, including photographs of different moments in Danvers' past.

Rambeau was very saddened when she learned that Danvers had disappeared in a mysterious plane crash. However, she refused to believe that Danvers had died and remained convinced for years that her friend had somehow survived the crash and would return soon. Rambeau preciously kept all the memorabilia of Danvers' life, including her leather jacket, although she was forbidden to wear it after spilling ketchup on it.

Alien Conflict
Carol Danvers' Return
Rambeau being reunited with Carol Danvers
In 1995, while hanging out in a plane owned by Maria Rambeau, Rambeau saw a woman approaching and immediately identified her as Carol Danvers. Overjoyed to see that her friend had indeed survived the crash, Rambeau rushed to Danvers, only to figure out that Danvers did not recognize her. Rambeau was even more surprised when Danvers told her and Maria her story involving extraterrestrials shapeshifters, but she was amazed when Danvers demonstrated her powers by boiling water by mere contact with a kettle.

Meeting the Skrulls
Rambeau discovers the existence of Skrulls
In an attempt to bring back Carol Danvers' memories, Rambeau, helped by Nick Fury, went in her bedroom to pick up all the objects connected to Danvers she had kept. She then detailed several of them to Danvers, hoping that something would match in Danvers' mind. Having forgotten the leather jacket, she briefly left to get it, and on her way back was approached by her mother. Rambeau then returned into the house, only to find her mother already there with Talos, as Rambeau had actually encountered Norex, disguised as her mother.

Rambeau telling her mother to join the mission
Rambeau was ordered by her mother to wait outside when Danvers, Maria, Fury and Talos listened to the black box recordings of Danvers' plane crash. Later, as Danvers planned on getting into space and asked Maria to be her co-pilot, Rambeau insisted that her mother should go, arguing that working with dangerous technology was what Maria used to do. Rambeau jokingly concluded on the example Maria would give to her daughter, which convinced Maria to join in the mission, much to Danvers' delight.

Rambeau redesigning Carol Danvers' uniform
As they prepared for the mission, during which Rambeau would remain with her grandparents, Rambeau was approached by Danvers, who praised her determination and asked her to choose the new colors of her Starforce Uniform. In the end, the colors were based on the United States Air Force T-shirt Rambeau was wearing, giving the uniform the red, blue and yellow colors Danvers would later permanently use.

Captain Marvel's Farewell
Rambeau bonding with Talos' daughter
Rambeau was reunited with her mother Maria and Carol Danvers as they successfully returned from their mission against the Kree Starforce. During the following dinner, Rambeau played Uno with Talos' daughter, and then suggested that the Skrulls could remain with them.

Rambeau watches Captain Marvel flying away
However, she was told that it would not be safe, and that Danvers would find a new home for them. Rambeau then claimed that she could meet with Danvers in space, and when Nick Fury remarked that she would have to gain superpowers, she quickly retorted that she might be able to build a spaceship some day. Upon Danvers' departure, Rambeau shared a loving farewell hug with her friend before watching her taking off in complete amazement.

S.W.O.R.D. Agent
Erased by the Snap
Many years after Carol Danvers accompanied the Skrulls on their search for a new homeworld, Rambeau continued her life on Earth, while her mother, Maria Rambeau, founded S.W.O.R.D.. Rambeau grew up to become a S.W.O.R.D. agent, working directly under her mother. Eventually, Maria was diagnosed with cancer. In 2018, Rambeau accompanied her mother to the hospital Parkside, where she underwent surgery. On the day her mother was scheduled to be released, Rambeau sat by her mother's hospital bed and fell asleep, thinking back on memories with her from 1995. Rambeau then died in her sleep as the Snap occurred, unaware of what had transpired.

Returned in the Blip
Rambeau getting resurrected in the Blip
Five years later, in 2023, Rambeau was resurrected in the Blip, and woke up believing she had been asleep for twenty minutes. However, she was taken aback when she saw that her mother was not in her bed. Rambeau left the hospital room to find other civilians being resurrected, and Parkside's capacity doubling. Rambeau frantically rushed to find a nurse for her mother's whereabouts, but all the staff were overwhelmed with the return of the Snap victims.

Eventually, Rambeau found Doctor Harley, who survived the Snap and was still working at Parkside. When asked about her mother, Doctor. Harley explained to Rambeau that Maria had passed away in 2020 from cancer complications after it came back, two years after Rambeau died in the Snap. Initially confused, Rambeau had little time to grasp and comprehend this information, as she realized that she herself had been dead for five years.

Back at S.W.O.R.D.
Rambeau returns to S.W.O.R.D.
Two weeks following the Blip, Rambeau returned to the S.W.O.R.D. Headquarters and met Tyler Hayward, who had taken on the role of director of S.W.O.R.D., in the wake of her mother's death. Rambeau was told by Hayward that the Earth and S.W.O.R.D. had been different since Rambeau's temporary death, due to the Snap.

Westview Anomaly
Investigating Westview
Rambeau investigating alongside Jimmy Woo
Having been grounded at S.W.O.R.D., Rambeau was sent on a missing persons case by Tyler Hayward. Once she arrived at Westview, Rambeau met FBI agent Jimmy Woo, who approached her and explained the situation. He exclaimed that according to the Eastview Sheriff's Office, the place had never actually existed. Rambeau walked up to the two cops sitting nest to a Welcome to Westview sign and, when she asking the cops about Westview, Sheriff Miller exclaimed that it never existed, despite the fact that they were from Eastview. Rambeau and Woo then walked over to the energy field to check out, as Rambeau then touched the field and was sucked into a strange reality.

Strange Reality
Town Committee Meeting
Geraldine is introduced to Wanda Maximoff
Once she was trapped inside the Westview Anomaly, Rambeau, having been mind-controlled by Wanda Maximoff, took on the identity of a woman named Geraldine. While a group of women of Westview attended a meeting for the small town talent show, Geraldine and Maximoff began to get closer, although heavily annoying Dottie Jones.

Small Town Talent Show
Geraldine witnesses all Vision's breakdowns
Later on, Geraldine hosted the talent show and got caught up by the consequences of Vision's gum problem, as Vision forgot to put Maximoff inside of the Cabinet of Mysteries. As a result, Maximoff, desperate for the town's approval, teleported Geraldine inside the cabinet. After that last act, Maximoff fixed Vision, and attempted leaving without noticing. However, Dottie Jones surprisingly gave them the award and, while she was receiving this, Geraldine asked Vision how he managed to get her inside the cabinet, to which he claimed that a magician never revealed his secrets. Vision left that to his assistant to which Maximoff replied that she would not be talking.

Wanda Maximoff's Pregnancy
Geraldine gets greeted by Wanda Maximoff
When Wanda Maximoff started having contractions due to her pregnancy, she inadvertently altered reality. As a result, Geraldine went to the Vision Residence to borrow a bucket because all of the pipes in her ceiling burst.

Unaware of what was going on in Maximoff's home, Geraldine began to tell a story about work. Geraldine eventually headed into the nursery. There she noticed the crib and discovered that Maximoff was pregnant, exactly at the moment that Maximoff started going into labor.

Geraldine attempted to get Maximoff ready to give birth and then noticed things around the home going haywire once again, but said to herself that she was sure there is a perfectly logical explanation for all of this. Eventually, Geraldine delivered Maximoff's baby boy and handed him over to Maximoff.

Ejected from Reality
Rambeau realizes Wanda Maximoff is upset
Back inside, Wanda Maximoff revealed to Geraldine that she herself is a twin. She appears overcome with emotion as she brings up Pietro Maximoff. before singing to her newborn babies a Sokovian lullaby. Geraldine was confused and reminded Maximoff that Pietro was killed by Ultron during the Battle of Sokovia. This made Maximoff quickly grow angry and confrontational, as Maximoff asked Geraldine to repeat what she said. Geraldine offered to take a shift rocking the babies, but Maximoff instead asked her to leave, as she noticed a strange necklace Geraldine was wearing. Maximoff once again questioned Geraldine about the symbol on her necklace and asked who she really was. Geraldine became visibly flustered and could not answer any of Maximoff's questions.

Rambeau is thrown out by Wanda Maximoff
Secretly, Maximoff had then used her powers to eject Rambeau out of Westview through her unbridled fury. Rambeau was thrown out through an invisible barrier protected by towering pylons shielding Westview from the rest of the world, hurling through the air and landing in a field outside the S.W.O.R.D. Response Base. As she drifted in and out of consciousness after being blasted outside, several S.W.O.R.D. SUVs and trucks with armed soldiers, and a helicopter, arrived and tended to her. She then told the S.W.O.R.D agents that Maximoff was the one who created the barrier.

Returning to Work
The next day, Rambeau was questioned about her experience inside the Hex. She explained feeling pain, loss, and grief, as well as hearing Maximoff in her head. Jimmy Woo and Darcy Lewis accompanied Rambeau to a briefing after Lewis noticed her scans were blank. At the briefing, Tyler Hayward identified Maximoff as the  “principal victimizer” and Woo explained her history, as well as defending her against Hayward. Rambeau also defended Maximoff, saying she only survived her experience in the Hex because Maximoff protected her.

To make Maximoff seem more dangerous, Hayward showed everyone in the room footage he claimed was of Maximoff stealing the corpse of Vision, which went against both the Sokovia Accords and the Vision's will, claiming she disobeyed his wishes to not be a weapon. In reality, the footage was of Hayward showing Maximoff the body of Vision, and her shattering glass to "feel" him.

Rambeau works on the Westview investigation
Rambeau, in an attempt to re-enter Westview, enlisted the help of Major Aly Goodner. Rambeau then explained to Woo that Billy and Tommy Maximoff were Maximoff's children and that everything that's been happening inside the Hex was real. Woo and Lewis remained initially skeptical of Maximoff having such abilities, but Rambeau pointed out that Maximoff almost took Thanos out on her own. Woo replied that Captain Marvel almost did the same. This, along with Lewis asking if Captain Marvel received her powers from an Infinity Stone, led Rambeau to change the topic and refocused on Maximoff.

Rambeau shoots her 1970s-era clothing
Rambeau found her 70’s-style attire, which she assured to Woo and Lewis was real. She grabbed Woo’s gun and shot the outfit, but it remained unscathed. Rambeau then realized the clothes were 87% Kevlar, similar to her bulletproof vest, which proved that Maximoff was rewriting reality. Rambeau wondered what would happen if they sent something from that time period into the Hex.

S.W.O.R.D. then sent a 90-era drone into the Hex, with Rambeau operating the controls. Rambeau attempted to speak to Maximoff, but she was unable too. Hayward then ordered another S.W.O.R.D. agent to fire a missile at Maximoff, much to the dismay and shock of Rambeau. However, the signal was lost, and Rambeau expressed her outrage at Hayward for his actions.

Confronted by Maximoff
Rambeau speaks with Wanda Maximoff
Once an alarm began to sound to signal another breach at the edge of the Westview Anomaly, Rambeau joined the rest of the S.W.O.R.D. agents, as they rushed to the border of the Hex. There, Rambeau witnessed Wanda Maximoff emerging from the Hex, dragging their destroyed S.W.O.R.D. Drone with her. Maximoff warned S.W.O.R.D. to stay out of her home, before Rambeau implores Maximoff to trust her, and that she knew she was an ally. Maximoff claimed that she had what she wanted, and that nobody could take it from her again. She then used her powers to have the soldiers turn their guns on Tyler Hayward, before she turned around and re-entered the Hex, turning it red and fortifying the Hex.

Relieved from Duty
Rambeau gets relieved from duty
After S.W.O.R.D. returned to the base, Rambeau confronted Tyler Hayward for antagonizing Maximoff, while Darcy Lewis, teased Hayward for nearly getting killed by his own men. Hayward remained convinced that taking out Maximoff was their only option, but Rambeau told him that that would only end in disaster for them, as Maximoff was more powerful. Hayward, claiming Rambeau was incapable of being objective, ordered her, Jimmy Woo, and Lewis off the base. However, Rambeau and Woo overpowered the S.W.O.R.D. agents, and snuck back onto the base.

Rambeau reading all of Tyler Hayward's files
Rambeau informed Woo and Lewis that her contact would be arriving with her method of re-entering the Hex in the next hour. In response, Lewis attempted to dissuade her, revealing that her exposure in the Hex has rewritten her cell DNA, but Rambeau remained determined to help Maximoff. Woo accompanied Rambeau, while Lewis stayed behind to breach Hayward’s remaining firewalls.

Rambeau sees the Hex expansion
After Maximoff expanded the Hex, Rambeau and Woo witnessed it from their Jeep, but had already left in time to escape the expansion from reaching them.

Gaining her Powers
Rambeau and Jimmy Woo meet Rambeau's contact
Monica Rambeau and Jimmy Woo retrieved the email that Darcy sent them about Cataract, learning that Hayward was unsuccessfully at attempting to bring Vision back online. Rambeau and Woo then meet up with Major Aly Goodner, who had delivered an armored S.W.O.R.D. Space Rover, theorized to be able to safely penetrate through the Hex.

Rambeau prepares to go into the Hex
Rambeau prepared to re-enter Westview. However, the rover collided with the barrier. This leads Rambeau and Goodner to discover that the barrier's density matches that of the rover and alters it into a truck. Due to this Rambeau is forced to eject from the vehicle. Despite protests from Woo, she breached the barrier herself. 

Rambeau successfully re-enters the Hex
Rambeau then pushes herself through. Despite resistance, she eventually breaks through. Her DNA was altered by going through the Hex a third time and she gained powers, such as spectral vision.

Confronting Wanda
Rambeau tries to speak to Wanda Maximoff
Rambeau then barged into the Vision Residence, attempting to warn Wanda Maximoff about Tyler Hayward's agenda. However, Maximoff angrily pushed Rambeau out of the house, and into the street, gaining the attention of all of Maximoff's neighbors. Maximoff accused Rambeau of lying about everything. Rambeau informed Maximoff that Hayward would destroy Westview to eliminate her, and attempted to get her to let go of her past, referencing how she lost her mother. However, before Rambeau could convince Maximoff that she was telling the truth, Agnes intervened and carried Maximoff away to her house, claiming Rambeau had overstayed her welcome.

Rambeau is found by Ralph Bohner
Rambeau snooped around the outside of Agnes' home, and found an entrance into the basement lair, only to be confronted by "Pietro Maximoff", who proceeded to capture Rambeau.

Ending the Anomaly
Rambeau finds out about Ralph Bohner
Inside Agatha Harkness' home, Rambeau was left trapped by "Pietro Maximoff", who refused to let her leave. She found a document regarding the property, revealing that Harkness did not own the house, but rather "Pietro", whose real name is Ralph Bohner. Rambeau found an Enchanted Necklace on Bohner. Once Rambeau removed it, Bohner was freed from his enthrallment, and Rambeau escaped.

Rambeau shields Billy and Tommy Maximoff
When Tyler Hayward attempted to shoot Billy and Tommy Maximoff, Rambeau rushed in and used her body to shield the twins, but missed one. However, it was stopped by Billy's telekinesis. Hayward attempted to use his Humvee to ram the three, but was stopped by a food truck driven by Darcy Lewis.

Rambeau watches Wanda Maximoff fly away
Once she had subdued Harkness, and erased the Hex, Vision, and her children, Wanda Maximoff returned to the scene of the battle, where she met Rambeau. She apologized to her for everything she had done, but Rambeau admitted she would have done the same to bring back Maria Rambeau. When the authorities arrived, Rambeau watched Maximoff fly away.

Rambeau meets with a Skrull
Rambeau then reunited with Jimmy Woo, in charge of the FBI's Westview Investigation, as Hayward was escorted away in handcuffs. She was then called into the local theatre by an FBI agent, who revealed herself to be a Skrull sent by Nick Fury, regarding an intergalactic mission.

Personality
During her childhood, Rambeau was a very lively and mature person, despite her age, which impressed most people who encountered her. She remained convinced that her friend Carol Danvers had survived, refusing to believe in her death since no solid evidence of it existed, and was proven right when Danvers came back to her six years later. Rambeau did her best to bring back Danvers' memories, nostalgically going through all the memorabilia she had gathered and kept for days to remember her friend. Rambeau could also be quite witty, such as she teased her mother about the example she was setting for her when refusing to leave for a dangerous mission, or when she claimed to Nick Fury that she could be able to build a spaceship to meet up with Danvers in space.

Monica was very close with her mother Maria. When she was resurrected in the Blip, Monica was in denial after finding out that in the five years since her disappearance, Maria had succumbed to her cancer. Knowing the pain of suddenly losing a loved one, she was able to connect and empathize with Wanda Maximoff, despite being attacked by her on two occasions, although those were merely fits of rage from a grieving Avenger who couldn't let go of a life she never had. Her empathy towards Maximoff led her to defy Tyler Hayward's order to terminate her. Despite pleading with Maximoff to let go of her past, Monica would admit to her in the aftermath of the Battle of Westview that if given the power, she would've brought Maria back.

Monica was also willing to throw herself into danger in order to protect the people she cared for. When the S.W.O.R.D. rover was unable to penetrate the Anomaly barrier, she used her body instead, exposing herself to the bombardment of radiation that altered her DNA multiple times. When Hayward attempted to shoot and kill Wanda's children, she used her body to stop the bullets.
