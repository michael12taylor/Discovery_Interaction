William "Billy" Russo was a Force Recon Marine who served alongside Frank Castle in Afghanistan, and the duo eventually became close friends. Russo and Castle were both recruited into Cerberus Squad under the leadership of William Rawlins, where they assisted in assassination missions. Upon leaving the Marine Corps, Russo was recruited by Rawlins to contribute to his illegal operations, gaining a financial reward and the ability to create his own company with Anvil. Russo's desire for power led him to betray Castle, allowing Rawlins to assassinate Castle's family. Once Castle returned, Russo was ordered to kill his former friend, as he used Dinah Madani to learn Castle's whereabouts, which had exposed Russo's own involvement in Operation Cerberus. Fearing he would be used as the scapegoat, Russo betrayed Rawlins, allowing Castle to kill him, before Russo had a grisly showdown with Castle, that had led to Russo's handsome face being horrifically scarred.

While attempting to repair his broken mind, Russo was able to escape from police custody and then began rebuilding his life, recruiting former soldiers to join him in a criminal gang, while asking for the help of Krista Dumont, his own former therapist, who he became infatuated with. All of Russo's crimes and his disfigured face gained him a nickname of Jigsaw, until he was suddenly reunited with the Punisher, as Jigsaw finally remembered how the Punisher disfigured his face and destroyed his entire life. Jigsaw found himself being tracked down by many of his past friends, as he had attempted to fight back and destroy the Punisher through violence and manipulation. However, after Madani had almost killed Dumont and critically wounded him, Jigsaw met his fate as the Punisher, tipped off by Curtis Hoyle, found Jigsaw, and swiftly executed him as revenge for all Russo's past crimes.

Biography
Early Life
Abandoned
Born to a meth addict, Billy Russo was abandoned by his own birth mother, Carla Russo, outside of a fire station in Albany, New York. Russo had then entered into the system and lived throughout various foster homes, before placed in the Ray of Hope group home, although Russo kept his strong sense of patriotism and had felt lucky to be born in the United States of America despite his circumstances. Also during this time, Russo built a great love of the game of baseball, believing that he could become the next Joe DiMaggio, despite being too poor to afford his own baseball gloves and uniform, like many of the other children had, something Russo resented.

Attempted Molestation
During his time at the Ray of Hope home, around the age of ten or eleven, Russo was also a victim of attempted child molestation when one of the good samaritans, Arthur Walsh, had called Russo pretty and had then attempted to attack him. Fearing for his own safety, Russo was still able to defend himself by then striking his attacker with a stickball bat, but not without still being severely injured by the perpetrator who proceeded to break his arm and ripped his rotator cuff in three places. When Tommy O'Neal finally spoke up about the abuse they were suffering, Walsh was sent to Sing Sing prison for his crimes.

Marine Corps
Training with Frank Castle
Russo is given a prep talk by Frank Castle
Seeking new purpose in his life, Russo later joined the United States Marine Corps, becoming a fierce soldier. During his training, Russo met and became close friends with Frank Castle, a fellow marine in training. As they completed their training together, Russo and Castle both underwent the gauntlet, in which they would walk through all their fellow marines while getting beaten down to prove their endurance as well as their physical strength, with Castle giving Russo a mocking prep talk before he went through the gauntlet first.

Russo and Castle celebrate their victory
Russo endured the punishment of being beaten by his fellow marines while being thrown into the freezing mud, eventually making it all the way through and being rewarded with cheers from his fellow men. Once Russo had made it through, it was the turn of Castle, who also endured the beating until he made it into Russo's arms at the end of the gauntlet. Laughing, Russo helped Castle onto his feet and told him that he loved him, before punching him in the stomach, much to the delight of everyone in attendance as the two brothers in arms had celebrated their success at making it through the gauntlet.

Recalling Past Trauma
Russo telling Frank Castle about his trauma
As his friendship with Frank Castle grew, Russo brought Castle with him to revisit the Ray of Hope back in New York City where they watched the children playing baseball together. Russo reminisced about how much he had loved the game, but had always envied the other children who had better equipment than he had, noting how he believed he would be the next Joe DiMaggio. However, Russo had noted how Arthur Walsh took away Russo's love of the game when Walsh attempted to sexually molest him.

Russo being complemented by Frank Castle
Russo told Castle how, following Walsh's assault, he came to hate baseball, to which Castle expressed his sympathy towards his friend, noting he had never stopped to think how lucky he was when he was a child to have his father attending every game he played, expressing a wish that Russo could have enjoyed that. As Russo acknowledged that the incident had made him the man he was today, while Castle noted that he was a badass since joined their United States Marine Corps, which they both laughed at. Russo then noted how he would always find himself returning to visit this location of his trauma.

Operation Cerberus
Russo listens to William Rawlins' war speech
During his time with the Marine Corps, Russo and Frank Castle were sent to Basra for a mission and they became trapped in a house and saved each other's lives multiple times. Russo and Castle were recruited along with other elite soldiers for a covert ops team. Their new leader, Agent Orange, explained they would helping to end the war, with Major Ray Schoonover explaining that they were all now part of Operation Cerberus, tasked with the capture, interrogation and assassination of high-profile targets, as Russo then compared their operation with the Phoenix Program.

Russo and Frank Castle discuss their teams
While relaxing while also reading The Picture of Dorian Gray, Russo listened as Castle was introduced to Gunner Henderson who would be joining his squad. They discussed their teams while Russo noted how Orange had failed to give them his name leading to him getting the nickname. As Castle expressed his personal distrust for Orange, Russo quoted a poem telling Castle their mission was the do or die. When Castle noted that he knew it, Russo teased him about having read the poem all by himself, leading to Castle jokingly hitting Russo in the face with his football while also apologizing for doing it.

Ambush in Kandahar
Russo and Frank Castle discuss going home
Russo rejoined Frank Castle back in their quarters just as Castle was opening birthday cards from his family and found his wife had gotten him Bruce Springstein tickets. Castle asked Russo if he had any plans for when he had returned home, to which Russo grinned and said that he did, leading to Castle then teasing Russo on his own reputation as a womanizer. Just as they discussed if Russo should instead find a woman to settle down with, Major Ray Schoonover walked inside and informed the pair that they would be needed for another mission briefing in five minutes time.

Russo is given a mission from Agent Orange
They entered their briefing to find Agent Orange was giving them a mission where they would come in on foot without any air support in order to capture a high value target who was believed to be hiding out there. When Schoonover invited Castle to give his opinion on the mission, he questioned why their new target would put themselves in this hard to escape from spot and claimed that this was likely a trap for Cerberus Squad. Schoonover asked Russo for his view to which he claimed to trust Castle; however,  Orange just ignored their advice and insisted that they still go into the mission regardless.

Russo takes cover from the enemy gunfire
Just as they predicted, the mission turned out to be an ambush as Russo and Castle became pinned down by enemy fire in Kandahar. As Russo noted that the enemy's mortars would kill them all if they did not do something, Castle explained that he would charge forward into the building and take out the enemy. Although Russo tried to go with him, Castle insisted that Russo had to stay behind and keep their soldiers safe, including Schoonover who had lost a hand. Russo and the remaining soldiers gave covering fire while Castle charged up the hill and furiously engaged with all the enemy alone.

Frank Castle's Rage
Russo slowly recovers from the ambush
Russo made it back to base with the surviving member of Cerberus Squad once Frank Castle had successfully cleared out the enemy and allowed air support to get them to safety. While Russo sat alone looking at his hands covered in Ray Schoonover and other soldier's blood, they were interrupted by the arrival of Agent Orange, who show no regard for the state of all the soldiers in the room and those who were dead and instead asked if they had successfully killed the target as they had been ordered to do.

Russo pulls Frank Castle off William Rawlins
Upon hearing this, Castle became enraged and before Russo could get to him, he had punched Orange and punctured his eye socket. Russo and the soldiers managed to pull Castle away from Orange before he could do more damage as Russo ordered the other men to stand down while he then stood between Castle and Orange. When Castle demanded to know why Russo was protecting Orange, Russo insisted that he was not but was protecting Castle as he claimed that Orange would never be blamed for the utter disaster of the Ambush in Kandahar or any other failed mission he had authorized.

Russo recommends Castle leave Cerberus
Russo insisted that Operation Cerberus was a complete lie and even told Castle to get out of the United States Armed Forces if he could, confessing that he was as he had already requested a transfer as soon as possible. Russo claimed that they could not keep doing all these sorts of missions any more as he looked down at Castle, who was bleeding heavily from a gunshot wound and was so enraged he could barely look Russo in the eye. Instead of saying anything more, Russo told Castle to look at himself before then walking away from his friend, ignoring Castle as he had called out to him.

Returning Home
Massacre at Central Park
Russo has a day out with the Castle family
Having returned back home for Afghanistan, Russo still continued his friendship with Frank Castle and his family, joining them for trips to Central Park. During one day out, Russo joked with Frank Castle, Jr. that his father had been highly uncreative when choosing his name, going on a long rant about how he had been named after Billy the Kid and how he had been the fastest gun in the West who was betrayed by his friend for money and fame, only for Lisa Castle to question how he knew his name's origin despite being an orphan.

Russo is playfully kissed by Maria Castle
Russo confessed to not knowing but Maria Castle insisted they were all the family he would ever need as the group of friends all shared a laugh. However, when William Rawlins learned Homeland Security agent Dinah Madani had received a tape of the Cerberus Squad as they had tortured and killed Ahmad Zubair, Russo was informed that Rawlins and Ray Schoonover, who believed Castle to be the source of the leak, had decided to assassinate him. Despite being ordered to be involved with the shooting, Russo strongly refused, but still did nothing to stop it, resulting in Castle's family being slaughtered.

Founding Anvil
Russo introduces himself to Dinah Madani
Using resources given to him by William Rawlins, Russo founded his own private military company named Anvil, recruiting former United States Armed Forces soldiers to become his own private army. While conducting a training session for Homeland Security, Russo personally greeted Sam Stein who was disappointed in his own performance during the simulation as he had come close to shooting a hostage, with Russo promising that the real thing was always messier and Stein had done well regardless.

Russo is interrupted by Carson Wolf's arrival
While Stein left to return all the equipment, Russo then introduced himself to Dinah Madani who questioned if Russo was the man in charge of the operation there, which he confirmed. While he was explaining how Anvil rented different spaces for all of their training exercises to keep things fresh, Russo then suggested that Anvil could make a deal with Homeland Security as a contract would be good business for them, while Madani explained that she had just returned from Afghanistan as Russo explained he had been himself before he had left the Marines, going private to found Anvil.

Russo asking Dinah Madani out for a drink
They were interrupted by Carson Wolf's arrival, who accused Madani of interrogating Russo, which she denied. While Russo invited Wolf to come to Anvil Headquarters to discuss a deal between their own organizations, Wolf cut him off to remind Madani to not get involved in case she was still looking into the Kandahar investigation. Wishing to get to know her better, Russo waited for Wolf to leave and then invited Madani to join him for a drink after they were both finally off duty, noting that once they were off duty she could discuss whatever she wanted with him, which Madani then happily agreed to.

Drink with Dinah Madani
Russo takes Dinah Madani out for their drink
Russo then took Dinah Madani out for a drink at a local bar, as she questioned if this was where he took women out to impress them. They discussed their time in Afghanistan as Madani claimed she had unfinished business there. Madani asked again which unit Russo served within the United States Marine Corps, to which Russo questioned if this was why Madani had agreed to join him, at which point Madani revealed she had already read his military file.

Russo discusses Frank Castle with Madani
Russo questioned if Madani had come to Anvil for training or to ask him about his service record, which she confirmed. Once he insisted he would not be throwing his friends under the bus, Russo invited Madani to ask him the questions. Madani immediately asked Russo about Frank Castle and seemed surprised when Russo informed her that he and Castle had been close friends while serving together. Russo told the story of when he and Castle fought together in Basra, which he claimed to be the best night of his life, before expressing his regret that Castle had been killed, noting that he missed him.

Russo says his goodbyes to Dinah Madani
While Madani noted that Castle had killed a lot of people before his own death, Russo then claimed that the people he had killed were all criminals and drug dealers. Madani questioned if Castle had become dirty while serving and even asked if he had gotten involved with smuggling heroin, which Russo simply laughed at, although Russo claimed that Castle's one way of staying clean was his family which were taken away from him. Changing the subject, Russo flirted with Mandani, asking if she was single before Madani's pager went off and she was forced to leave early.

Mourning Frank Castle
Russo is reunited back with Curtis Hoyle
Russo went to visit Curtis Hoyle in St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church before his meeting with soldiers of the United States Armed Forces who were now suffering from PTSD. Hoyle mocked Russo, claiming that he moved too quietly and needed to wear a bell like a cat before they shook hands and had a cup of coffee. Russo gave Hoyle a cheque to fund the meetings, with Hoyle continuing to tease Russo before they discussed how everything was going with all of the recent meetings with veterans.

Russo refuses to come to Hoyle's meetings
Hoyle invited Russo to stay so the men could see a soldier who had come back and had a successful second life with Anvil. Russo still, however, claimed that if he stayed he would feel guilty that he had gotten out of the war-zone before suffering PTSD, while Hoyle noted that there was nothing selfish about him funding the meetings with his own money. They then discussed how Anvil was doing as Hoyle noted how pleased he was that Russo had become the success he had always planned to become before Russo again offered Hoyle a position within Anvil, which Hoyle politely refused to accept.

Russo and Hoyle agree to meet later tonight
Russo then asked if they would still be meeting that night to pay their respects to Frank Castle's grave, which Hoyle confirmed they would be as Russo helped him to get back up. As he was leaving, Russo turned around and recommended that Hoyle should come and work for him, jokingly promising that he would look after him; however, Hoyle noted that despite losing his leg during a battle, he had gotten out of the military in time as well and did not wish to go back to that life of combat, which Russo accepted as his answer and noted that this made them the lucky ones before Russo then walked away.

Russo drinking beside Frank Castle's grave
Arriving at Castle's grave later that night, Russo and Hoyle wished their late friend a happy birthday while they drank together. Russo expressed his regret that Castle had not come to them in the wake of the Massacre at Central Park so they could have avenged the deaths of Maria Castle and the children together, although Hoyle insisted that Castle did not want any help with killing everyone involved in his family's deaths. When Hoyle had quoted Castle regarding Kandahar, Russo questioned when Castle had made these comments before they continued drinking and remembering their lost friend.

Anvil Recruits
Russo gives a speech to the Anvil recruits
While at the Anvil Headquarters, Russo personally welcomed all the new recruits who were looking to join Anvil private military company. Giving a speech to the recruits, Russo explained in detail how to be trained for the United States Armed Forces, the government had already invested thousands of dollars into each and every one of them, and therefore they were all investments who should be doing the best they could with what had now been provided to them.

Russo tells his recruits to show their worth
Questioning how much money each of them were currently earning, Russo argued that the problem was not that they were unworthy of the investment, but that they all simply needing to get the work that they were suited for, noting Anvil would give them the opportunity to fight for a living, which he knew was the reason they had signed up to be soldiers in the first place. Russo promised all the men looking to join up with Anvil the chance to find not just a living wage suitable for them, but something to fight and live for, while also giving them a new brotherhood of soldiers who they could stand with.

Russo watches all Lewis Wilson's training
Russo had all of the recruits begin training, so he could examine their physical and mental state and judge if they were worthy candidates for joining Anvil's forces. While making his way all around the room, Russo noticed Lewis Wilson, who was training on the pull up bar with another recruit. Knowing that Wilson had come to him having spoken to Curtis Hoyle, Russo was impressed by Wilson's determination as he pushed the other recruit to continue training before Russo then continued making his way around the room to look at the progress of the other possible recruits as they continued their training.

Rejecting Lewis Wilson
Russo listening to Curtis Hoyle's advice
Entering his office, Russo spoke with Curtis Hoyle who had arrived to talk about the current mental state of Russo's possible new recruit for the team, Lewis Wilson, who had also been attending Hoyle's therapy sessions. Fearing that Wilson was not mentally stable, Hoyle recommended that Wilson not be selected for Anvil, noting that Wilson was living inside a hole he had dug within his back garden and had almost shot his own father by mistake due to his PTSD.

Russo takes Hoyle's advice on Lewis Wilson
Although Russo argued that Wilson could just need to get back into the action since leaving Afghanistan and Anvil could provide this for him, Hoyle insisted that Wilson was a ticking time bomb and then made the point that Wilson was not the sort of soldier who would be able to protect any of his fellow men, noting that he would not want Wilson protecting him during a combat situation. Although Russo had questioned how Wilson would react when he was cut from Anvil, Hoyle reassured him that he would take of Wilson afterwards, which Russo accepted, trusting Hoyle's judgment on this.

Russo telling Lewis Wilson he is rejected
Finding Wilson talking with some of the other Anvil recruits about his missions while he was in Mosul, Russo then called over Wilson for a private talk in which Russo asked him about the foxhole he had dug in his back garden. Clearly unnerved that Russo knew of this, Wilson then tried to claim that it was just a project he had undertaken and insisted that it was nothing to be alarmed about; however, Russo then noted that all his fellow United States Armed Forces recruits may not think the same as they all needed to trust in Wilson's mental stability while they were going on missions. Russo then told Wilson he would not be recruited, leading to Wilson blaming Hoyle for the rejection.

Russo demands Lewis Wilson to leave Anvil
Wilson was clearly mortified by the rejection, claiming that Hoyle had first told him not to even try and be recruited into Anvil and had now sabotaged his chances as Russo tried to get Wilson to calm down as he began to raise his voice. While Russo defended Hoyle by claiming he was one of the finest men he had served with, he offered Wilson other work, but Wilson responded by insulting him for offering nothing but cleaning jobs and accused him of lying, so Russo then demanded that he leave Anvil Headquarters, much to Wilson's great disappointment as Russo had Wilson escorted back outside.

Choosing to forget about their drinks and distract themselves from their bad days, the pair headed back to the Madani Residence where Russo and Madani immediately began kissing and removing their clothes, at which point Russo then noticed several harsh bruises on Madani's body caused by a recent car wreak. While Russo tried to stop due to concern over Madani's wellbeing, Madani just refused to discuss it and insisted that they continue.

Russo and Madani had sex again the next day, and in the morning as Russo was finding his clothes he discovered some of Madani's work which detailed her investigation into Cerberus Squad.

Madani explained that she believed Castle was investigating the same case of Kandahar that she was, alerting Russo that Operation Cerberus' secrets were in danger. Madani told Russo that the people who were also hunting Castle had left him for dead and would kill him if they did not get to him first. Russo promised to do what he could before thanking Madani for trusting him with this information.

Seeking to learn more, Russo then went to visit Curtis Hoyle and had immediately asked if he had seen Castle recently. Upon hearing the question, Hoyle appeared to be confused, asking if Russo had meant if he had visited the grave or seen ghosts. Believing that Hoyle did not know the truth, Russo then informed him of Castle's survival, which Hoyle just struggled to believe. Russo explained that he had learned from Homeland Security that Castle was now hurt and asked Hoyle if he had any idea on how to find him, noting that he could help get Castle out of the country and safe to make things right.

Reunion with Castle

Finally, Russo's calls were answered and Frank Castle had agreed to meet with him.

Seeking to end Castle's search for those responsible for Cerberus, Russo then offered him the chance to go work for Anvil overseas and noting that although Castle's family were gone they were still brothers.

With the offer to take a new job with Anvil overseas still on the table, Castle left to think it over and decide what would be the best move for him; however, Russo began planning for his friend's assassination, fearing that Castle could expose Cerberus Squad and ruin everything he had been building since leaving the United States Armed Forces. Russo gathered together a large team of his best Anvil agents, who were all ready to fire upon Castle when he arrived, but after several hours of waiting, Castle had still not arrived. Irritated, Russo put his gun away and joined William Rawlins in their car, informing him that Castle was not coming, much to Rawlins' great annoyance.

Lying to Madani
Russo walks straight past Sam Stein's office
Russo returned into the Homeland Security Headquarters, where he smiled at Sam Stein as he then walked into Dinah Madani's office. Handing her a coffee, Russo went to kiss Madani only to be rejected as she was on duty. Russo briefly flirted with Madani before she noted how tired he looked and asked what information he had on Frank Castle. Russo, however, lied and claimed he had found nothing on Castle and had not been able to confirm he was alive.

Russo denies ever speaking to Frank Castle
Russo then claimed that he had also reached out to members of the United States Armed Forces who had served with Castle and had still failed to come up with any kind of information about Castle's current condition. Russo questioned why Madani had claimed Castle was hurt and she told him about the firefight in which a badly wounded Castle was the only survivor. Russo asked why Madani had not gone public with all this if she knew of Castle's survival, with Madani only noting that she had already told Russo more than she should have because she thought that he could help her find Castle.

Madani confirmed that she still did not know who was involved with the firefight that killed Gunner Henderson but she claimed she did not know, noting that without Castle she had no leads.

Rawlins gave Russo a glass of whiskey before Rawlins told Russo that they did not have to worry about Madani anymore now that Gunner Henderson had just been assassinated by Rawlins' men.

Russo insults William Rawlins' true sexuality
Assuring Rawlins that they would get to Frank Castle before Madani could, Russo promised that he knew Castle better than anyone else before Rawlins noted that Russo had made a mistake in not killing Castle when he had the chance. When Russo questioned the tactics of such a plan, Rawlins recommended using a sniper to kill Castle, leading to Russo mocking Rawlins by claiming that he used to find torturing people sexually arousing while a part of Cerberus Squad. Russo also noted that he had seen fear in Rawlins' eyes when Castle had attacked him in Kandahar before Russo had saved him.

Russo and Rawlins discuss Morty Bennett
Rawlins, however, warned that while he was grateful for Russo saving his life, he knew Russo was only protecting the man who would build his career, noting that if Castle exposed Operation Cerberus then Russo's life and career at Anvil would fall apart. Getting up, Russo then asked what they now planned to do about Morty Bennett, to which Rawlins claimed that they could not warn him Punisher was coming as he would run or talk so they would instead save his life and then take him under their protection where they would intend to kill him afterwards when Castle had finally been killed.

Infiltration into Fort Bryon
Russo learns that the Punisher has arrived
In a top secret operation which not even Morty Bennett was aware of, Russo and his team of Anvil agents waited outside Fort Bryon until they got the signal from the woman Bennett was with that Frank Castle had arrived in the building, at which point Russo informed all of his men and they rushed the building to attempt to assassinate their target, wearing masks and armed with military grade weapons to kill Castle.

Russo leads his Anvil agents into the room
As it turned out however, Castle was ready for their sudden ambush as he had filled the entire room with smoke making it impossible for Russo and his team to clearly make out their target. Armed with laser sights on their rifles, Russo and his unit scanned the room for either Castle or Bennett, only to discover that Castle was using his training within the United States Armed Forces as well as the smoke to his own advantage to take out Russo's men one by one. Seeing through Castle's plan, Russo turned off his own laser pointer to try and find an advantage while the rest of his men were slowly taken out.

Russo fails to finally execute the Punisher
Tracking a laser pointer which he had believed Castle had taken over, Russo waited until it was still and fired upon it, only to discover that Castle had in fact left it on the desk in order to trick Russo. As Russo scanned the room to find his target, Castle had managed to get the drop on Russo; however, and they then both shot and mildly wounded each other. When Castle told Russo, who he did not recognize due to the mask, to stay down, Russo ignored him and chased after him as Castle then jumped through the window and ran to safety on foot, as Russo continuing to fire after him despite just missing his shots.

Russo reveals his identity to Morty Bennett
With Castle now on the run from the military in the base, Russo then addressed his men, who were wounded from their encounters with the Punisher as he had managed to sneak up on and take advantage of all of them under the shadow of the smoke he had used. Russo then found Bennett, who was still wearing the ball gag Castle had left him with, who then questioned what Russo himself was doing there. Noting that Bennett was still partially undress from his time with the woman, Russo ordered Bennett to follow him and do exactly as he had instructed him to do, which Bennett agreed to do.

Assassination of Morty Bennett

Russo brought Morty Bennett away from danger and he listened to Bennett yell at William Rawlins as he then furiously blamed him for allowing the Punisher to ambush and almost kill him. Bennett told Russo and Rawlins that he had told Fort Bryon that it had been a training exercise before then questioning what would be done next, to which Rawlins promised to get him out of the country with a new identity to ensure that the Punisher would not be able to find him, before Russo then ordered Bennett to leave his phone behind.

Russo takes Morty Bennett to his hide out
As Rawlins instructed, Russo took Bennett to a secure location in a cheap motel where they knew they would be safe from Frank Castle. Russo listened as Bennett complained about every aspect of the room before noting that Bennett had never liked him, while Bennett claimed that he had always seen the United States Marine Corps as filled with pretentious people like Russo. As Bennett explored the room, Russo allowed him to uncover the corpse of the Mistress he had been spending his night with, revealing their plan to then create a convincing murder scene for Bennett and his lover.

Russo stabs and kills Colonel Morty Bennett
Bennett desperately pleaded with Russo, attempting to argue that he would soon be out of the United States Armed Forces and that what he had said before really did not matter. However, Russo ignored everything Bennett had said and proceeded to use his secret wrist blade to then fatally stab Bennett in the gut before taking the gun out of his hands. As the dying Bennett crawled across the floor, Russo watched as he bled the death while he ripped out the phone cable and told Bennett as he died on the floor that he had never liked him either before then calling Rawlins to confirm Bennett's death.

Personal Visit
Russo admires his own image in the mirror
As always, Russo underwent his morning routine of skincare and styling his hair in front of a mirror to ensure that he looked his best.

Russo spoke to his mother, noting that she had been given a therapy lamp as she wanted and that the nurses had been cleaning her teeth for her. Russo proceeded to tell his mother about the tough week he had been having, noting that since Frank Castle had returned to New York City he knew that just smiling would not be enough to deal with Castle, as Castle intended to destroy Anvil and everything Russo had built since he had first joined with Operation Cerberus. Russo noted to his mother who was still not responding to what he said and that she was the one person who he could still be truly honest with.

Russo gives his own mother her injection
When Russo tried to give his mother some water, she accidentally spilt it down herself which annoyed Russo. Standing over his terrified mother, Russo questioned if she would have done anything different if she could have raised him up again, reminding her of how her drug usage had led to him being put into foster homes as a child. Russo concluded that her abuse may have made Russo a stronger man in the end. Russo ripped the duvet off his mother before giving her her injection as she moaned in fear, telling her that he would have given anything for her love before Russo walked out of the building.

Discussing Battle Scars

Russo returned into the Madani Residence where Russo and Dinah Madani had sex in her shower. Once finished, Russo lay naked with only a towel in Madani's bed while watching her put on clothes ready to return to work at Homeland Security. As she looked at his body, Madani questioned where some of Russo's bruises came from, with Russo lying about the recent shootout which caused it and claiming that they had come from a paintball during his training.

Russo is teased about his own good looks
Changing the subject, Russo pointed to one of his real scars which he explained he gained while in the United States Armed Forces and was shot with an AK-47. Russo asked Madani about her own scars to which she claimed one was from an angry lover who stabbed her, which Russo did not believe. Madani teased Russo by noted that he had so many scars and yet none on his attractive face before asking about two large scars on his shoulder, making up a story about how Russo's parachute had once failed to open and he then fell through a tree which resulted in the scars as they laughed together.

Russo explains his own sexual assault story
Russo calmly told Madani of how due to his mother's meth addiction he had been forced to grow up within the Ray of Hope group home where Arthur Walsh had almost sexually assaulted him at the age of either ten or eleven, before Russo had tried to defend himself which resulted in Walsh seriously damaging his shoulder, resulting in all of the scars. Madani confessed that she did not know about this part of Russo's life as it had not been in his personal file when she had been researching him, resulting in Russo teasing her over the middle class guilt she was feeling for having a good childhood unlike him.

Russo expresses his attitude towards life
Russo, however, noted that he still believed that regardless of all the trauma he had once suffered and the lack of knowledge about his exact birthplace, he still felt lucky for being born in the United States of America. Madani thanked Russo for feeling that he could trust her with these facts about his life, as Russo teased her over the fact that if they continued having real personal conversations then she may have to admit to liking him. As Madani finished putting on the rest of her clothes, she asked about Russo's mother as Russo told her that he still had no happy ending to his own personal life story.
