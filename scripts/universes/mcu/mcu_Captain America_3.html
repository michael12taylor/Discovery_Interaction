<html><p>Wilson insisted that it was time for them to acknowledge Rogers' legacy, as well as looking to the future. With that, Wilson thanked Captain America, but handed the shield over to the Smithsonian, where it was put on display, alongside Captain America's uniform, Motorcycle and other items from his life. Following the speech and the handing over ceremony, Wilson had joined James Rhodes and a Government Official who thanked Wilson for handing over the shield, claiming that it was the right thing to do. Once the Official shook his hand and departed, Wilson was invited by Rhodes to have a talk.

Wilson is thanked for handing over the shield
Wilson told Rhodes that he had spent time in Louisiana, where he had seen his sister and two nephews, who had grown up while he had been gone, with Rhodes offering to teach them how to fly if they ever came to Washington. Rhodes commented that it seemed crazy to him that nobody would be wielding the shield, to which Wilson acknowledged that nobody had wielded it for seventy years, although Rhodes insisted that lived in a different time.

Wilson and James Rhodes discuss the shield
Rhodes had then asked Wilson why he had chosen not to take up the mantle of Captain America, to which Wilson explained that he had always felt that the shield had belonged to somebody else, which he had said to Rogers as soon as he was given the shield. As they looked at various photographs of Captain America, Rhodes commented that the world was a crazy place, where nobody was really stable, while various alliances had since fallen apart in the wake of the Blip.

Wilson taking one final look toward the shield
Wilson was told by Rhodes that everybody had been looking for somebody to come and fix the world, which Wilson acknowledged. As the two of them looked at the shield in it's new display, Rhodes told Wilson that it was a new day, before promising that he would be in touch, as Rhodes left the Smithsonian. Once he was alone, Wilson took some time to closely examine the shield in it's display, as he considered his decision to hand the shield over to the Smithsonian.

Returning Home
Wilson visiting with his family in Louisiana
Wilson left Washington, D.C. and drove down to Delacroix, Louisiana to visit with his sister Sarah Wilson and his two nephews. He was greeted by them at their family dock and was told by Sarah that their family boat, Paul & Darlene, needed repairs. Sarah also told him that their house needed financing that she did not have in order to keep it, although Wilson said half of it was his and he wanted to keep it.

Wilson receiving the news he can't be given a loan
Sam told his sister that he can help her with her finance issue and took her to the local bank, to get a loan due to his being an Avenger. Where the employee didn't recognize Sam at first, which he reminded him that he is the Falcon. However, their appointment didn't go as well when the employee told them he couldn't give them the loan. Sam refusing to give up, saying he owned half of it also and they're not selling the boat.

Wilson learns about the new Captain America
Afterwards, he received a text from Joaquín Torres and returned to Sarah's house. He video-chatted with Torres who told him about the Robbery of Gasel Bank and Wilson told him he was glad he was okay. However, Wilson was interrupted by Sarah who asked him to watch the WHiH World News report where a new Captain America was being introduced with the shield.

Chasing Super Soldiers
Reunion with Bucky Barnes
Wilson and Bucky Barnes are reunited
Back at the USAF base, Wilson and Joaquín Torres prepared to leave for Germany and discussed John Walker as the new Captain America, until Wilson was approached by Bucky Barnes. A frustrated Barnes asked Wilson why he gave up the shield, but Wilson told him that he had other issues to worry about, specifically the Flag Smashers. He then told Barnes to stay behind and left for the airplane, but Barnes came anyways.

Chase of the Flag Smashers
Falcon ignoring all Bucky Barnes' questions
Once Joaquín Torres had announced the departure time once they reached Munich, Falcon suited up and prepared to jump, but frustrated Bucky Barnes by having no plan of attack.

Falcon and Bucky Barnes arrive in Munich
Falcon used Redwing to locate Barnes after he had jumped out with no flight gear and fell into the forest below. They met up at an abandoned factory and Falcon teasingly played with Barnes using Redwing. After the two made too much noise, they were spotted by the Flag Smashers who were loading heavy boxes into trucks.

Falcon flies back down to attack Flag Smasher
Falcon and Barnes gave chase after them and caught up with the trucks on the highway. After Barnes was restrained by the terrorists and Redwing was destroyed by Flag Smasher, Falcon arrived and joined the fight, freeing Barnes to join also.

Falcon is overpowered by the Flag Smashers
Falcon and Barnes were aided by the arrival of Captain America and Battlestar who came in via a helicopter and fought the Flag Smashers. After Barnes fell off the top of truck, Falcon swooped in and grabbed him and the two rolled into the grass nearby and Barnes landed on top of Falcon, who told him to get off.

Introduced to John Walker
Wilson continues to annoy Bucky Barnes
They returned to the highway and proceeded to walk to the airport which was twenty miles away, but were found by John Walker and Lemar Hoskins in their military vehicle.

Wilson being first introduced to John Walker
Despite refusing to hop in at first, Wilson and Bucky Barnes accepted the second time and was told by Hoskins that they had tracked them down by Redwing. Wilson found out that Redwing was being used by the U.S. government and deduced that was the reason his drone was glitchy.

Wilson becoming annoyed by John Walker
When Hoskins introduced himself as "Battlestar", Barnes ordered the driver to stop and got out of the vehicle. Before exiting the vehicle, Walker told Wilson that was not trying to replace or be Steve Rogers. Once Walker suggested that Wilson and Barnes could be his wingmen, they hopped off the vehicle and left on their own for the airport.

Meeting Isaiah Bradley
Wilson giving Bucky Barnes some advice
On the airplane back to the United States of America, Wilson listened as Bucky Barnes suggeste that they steal John Walker's shield again. Wilson reminded Barnes the last time they did that, Sharon Carter was named enemy of the state, and he and Steve Rogers were on the run for two years.

Wilson denies being known as "Black Falcon"
When they arrived back in the U.S., Barnes took Wilson to Baltimore, Maryland. There they walked into a neighborhood and a boy called Wilson "Black Falcon" to which Wilson corrected and then jokingly responded back. They arrived at Isaiah Bradley's house and were greeted by his grandson, Eli Bradley.

Wilson and Bucky Barnes meet Isaiah Bradley
After being let in, Wilson was introduced to Bradley and learned that he was a black super-soldier and had fought in the Korean War in the 1950s. Barnes informed him of more super-soldiers and asked for his help, but Bradley responded angrily by flinging a metal can into the wall, and revealed that he was thrown in jail and scientists took samples of his blood. Wilson attempted to apologize, but Bradley angrily demanded that they leave his house.

Wilson watches Bucky Barnes being arrested
In the street, Wilson asked Barnes why no one had known about Bradley, before they were interrupted by Baltimore policemen who came to arrest Barnes for missing his therapy session. After Barnes was taken away in the police car, Wilson looked back at Isaiah's house and left to go to the police station.

Session with Bucky Barnes
Wilson being introduced to Christina Raynor
Wilson arrived at the Baltimore Police Station, where he had met with Bucky Barnes' therapist Christina Raynor. 

Wilson learning about John Walker's actions
The two were interrupted when John Walker arrived and told Raynor that he had given permission for Barnes to be freed from therapy since he would be needed for the time being, before leaving. Wilson told Raynor he was leaving as well, only for her to force him to enter the therapy session with Barnes.

Wilson and Bucky Barnes in their therapy
In the session, Raynor asked Wilson and Barnes to have open dialogue and Wilson told Barnes that what he did with the shield is what he thought was right. He then left the room and waited outside for Barnes.

Wilson refuses to work with John Walker
After Barnes came out, the two were approached by Walker and Lemar Hoskins who were waiting outside for them. Walker invited them to come join them, but Wilson politely declined telling him that they were free agents and not bound to government regulation.

Wilson discusses meeting with Helmut Zemo
He and Barnes walked down the street, discussing what they should do next, until Barnes brought up the idea of meeting with Helmut Zemo in order to find out more information about the Flag Smashers, which Wilson reluctantly agreed to.

Escape of Helmut Zemo
Wilson and Bucky Barnes arrive at the prison
Wilson and Bucky Barnes went to the Berlin Correctional Facility and walked down towards the prison cells together. However, before they reached Helmut Zemo's cell, Barnes told Wilson that he would go in alone and told him they would meet up afterwards. 

Wilson and Bucky Barnes inside the garage
Wilson went to a garage nearby the correctional facility with Barnes, and asked what they were doing inside a garage. Barnes then told him in an indirect way that he organized a prison riot in order for a certain person to escape. The two were then met by the escaped Zemo who walked into the garage. Upon seeing Zemo out of prison, Wilson was upset and demanded to know why he was free, but after Barnes explained what happened, he reluctantly went along with Barnes' plan. However, he told Zemo that they would be watching him closely. 

Wilson waiting on Helmut Zemo to get ready
Wilson and Barnes took Zemo to his garage so he could get his belongings. While they were there, Wilson watched Zemo carefully, still not fully trusting him. After Zemo gathered his belongings, he took Wilson and Barnes to an airfield.

Wilson is taken to Helmut Zemo's private jet
Zemo brought Wilson and Barnes to his private plane and they flew off. On the plane, Zemo told them that they didn't know what life had been like in the correctional facility, but that Wilson might since he was on the Raft at one point.

Wilson warning Helmut Zemo to be careful
Wilson wanted to know where they were going, but Zemo was interested in Barnes' notebook, which Wilson recognized as being Steve Rogers' notebook. Wilson remembered that he had recommended Marvin Gaye to Rogers and Zemo agreed that it was a masterpiece. Eventually, Zemo told them they were going to Madripoor and that they needed disguises.

Undercover in Madripoor
Wilson discusses the plan with Helmut Zemo
After arriving on the outskirts of Madripoor, Wilson was frustrated with the clothes and admitted that he did look like he was the Smiling Tiger as he walked with Helmut Zemo and Bucky Barnes. Zemo told the two they needed to remian in character upon entering the city. 

Wilson leads Helmut Zemo and Bucky Barnes
Once they had arrived inside Madripoor's centre, Wilson and Barnes were led by Zemo through the streets, passing armed guards and secret dealings along the way, as he took them past the Princess Bar and instead took them to the Brass Monkey. Once inside, Zemo brought them to the bar, where the Bartender mistook Wilson for Smiling Tiger, while Zemo explained that their plans had changed, and they needed to speak with Selby about their business, which the bartender was skeptical about.

Wilson and Helmut Zemo get a drink at the bar
Wilson was offered Smiling Tiger's usual drink, which included the insides of a snake, much to his horror, which Zemo drank with him, despite Wilson's obvious discomfort. However, while they were stood at the bar, Zemo was approached by one of Brass Monkey's henchmen, who explained that Zemo was not welcome there, to which Zemo insisted that he did not have any business with Power Broker, but suggested that he come talk to him in person. Wilson then watched to his displeasure Barnes pretend to be the Winter Soldier again to protect Zemo. 

Wilson being first introduced to Selby
Shortly, they were granted entry to meet Selby who Zemo talked with about who made the Super Soldier Serum. They were interupted when Wilson's phone rang and he was forced to put his sister on speaker. After she said she had to go tend to Cass Wilson and then said Wilson's name, Selby ordered them all to be killed, but to Wilson's shock, Selby was killed by a sniper. Zemo told them to leave immediately and the three ran out, just as bounty hunters started to chase them and fire bullets at them. Wilson complained that he couldn't run in the shoes he was wearing. 

Wilson is found and saved by Sharon Carter
The three found themselves saved from the bounty hunters when Sharon Carter stepped out of the shadows and removed her hoodie. Wilson and Barnes told her not to shoot at Zemo who she wanted too, since it was his fault that she had to go into hiding. When asked why she was there, Carter reminded them of her going into hiding after stealing Captain America's Shield and the EXO-7 Falcon. She then agreed to help them and led them to her apartment.

Deal with Sharon Carter
Wilson is given clothes from Sharon Carter
At Carter's apartment, Wilson changed from the Smiling Tiger clothing to his regular clothes. He told Sharon Carter about the Flag Smashers and that they stole vials of Super Soldier Serum. 

Wilson making his deal with Sharon Carter
Wilson also promised her that he would get her a pardon so she could return to the United States of America since she was afraid of getting arrested upon returning. Carter told them she had to meet with clients, and Wilson, Barnes, and Zemo went to Carter's party which was filled with people dancing and drinking in a night-club setting. After Carter located Wilfred Nagel, she came and got Wilson, Barnes, and Zemo.

Ambush at the Shipyard
Wilson getting ready to go meet Wilfred Nagel
The following day, Wilson followed Sharon Carter's lead to the Buccaneer Bay shipyard on the outskirts of Madripoor, with Wilson and Helmut Zemo agreeing that Madripoor knew how to party, based on the previous night, although Carter warned that there was still a bounty on their heads. Carter led them to a container where Wilfred Nagel seemingly was, giving each of them an earpiece so they could stay in contact, while she would stay outside to keep watch. Zemo led Wilson and Bucky Barnes into Nagel's Laboratory. Entering the lab, Wilson and Barnes raised their guns, and soon found Nagel working on the Super Soldier Serum, as they turned off his music and surprised him.

Wilson taking Wilfred Nagel as their captive
Although Nagel tried to force them out, he stopped once he saw Barnes, recognising him as Winter Soldier, while Nagel introduced Zemo, noting that Nagel would have heard of Zemo. While Nagel attempted to suggest they make a deal, Carter warned Wilson and the others on the radios that bounty hunters were arriving at the shipyard. Wilson listened as Nagel explained that HYDRA had recruited him into their Winter Soldier Program, continuing their work after the Winter Soldiers had failed to be controlled.

Wilson asking Wilfred Nagel about the serum
Wilson listened to Nagel explained that he had come to Madripoor following the Blip, where the Power Broker funded his work, noting that he had created twenty vials of the serum, before Karli Morgenthau stole them. Once Carter stormed into the lab, warning that they were out of time, Zemo shot Nagel in the chest, killing him before Wilson and Carter took the gun away from him.

Wilson battling against the bounty hunters
Within seconds, a bounty hunter shot the laboratory causing it to explode and Wilson, Barnes, and Carter hit the ground to avoid the blast. After they got back up, they noticed that Zemo had escaped. The three quickly found themselves cornered, but soon saw Zemo on top of a container shooting at the hunters, causing another explosion. Once they could run clear from the bounty hunters, they made their escape, and ran throughout the shipyard. 

Wilson in the backseat of the getaway car
After running throughout the shipyard, Wilson, Barnes, and Carter were shortly met by Zemo who had stolen a getaway car. Wilson asked Carter to join them but she told him she couldn't and reminded him to get her a pardon before leaving. When Wilson got in the car, he found himself in the backseat and assumed Barnes wouldn't give him the front, to which he was correct. This was reminiscient of when he didn't give up his front seat for Barnes in 2016. Wilson sat in the back as Zemo drove off away to his private plane.

Next Stage
Journey to Latvia
Wilson gets information about Donya Madani
On the plane, Wilson talked with Joaquín Torres via phone who told him that Donya Madani had died. Wilson also told Bucky Barnes that he wished that he had not put shield in the museum, but rather that he destroyed it. After arriving in Riga, Latvia, Wilson was left with Helmut Zemo when Barnes told them that he needed to go check something out and left them.

Wilson discusses the Flag Smashers in Latvia
Wilson and Zemo went into the building to the room where they would stay in and waited for Barnes to return. Wilson got comfortable in the room, while Zemo took a shower. When Barnes returned, the three discussed their next move in locating the Flag Smashers. Barnes also told them about the Dora Milaje and how they wanted to arrest Zemo. When Zemo thanked them for defending him, Wilson did not agree that that was exactly correct.

Search for Donya Madani
Wilson and Bucky Barnes in the GRC camp
After making a plan, Wilson and Bucky Barnessplit up to scout the Global Repatriation Council refugee camp in Riga to find out about Donya Madani's funeral but find out that the refugees are sympthaizers of the Flag Smashers. Without getting any knowledge, they meet up and found Helmut Zemo in the camp square and witness him talking to refugee children. After Zemo returns to them, he tells them that he knows where to go and they follow him, but are confused of how he acquired the information. Afterwards, Wilson calls Sharon Carter because she has access to satellites and she tells him that she will assist him via phone.

Peace Talks Interrupted
Wilson gets stopped by Captain America
While following Helmut Zemo through the streets, Wilson and Bucky Barnes run into Captain America and Battlestar who demand to know why Zemo is out of prison. Wilson told Captain America that he wanted to talk with Karli Morgenthau, noting her vulnerability from losing a loved one.

Wilson and Captain America make a plan
Since Battlestar agreed, Captain America reluctantly did as well so and the group go to the location of the funeral. Once inside, Captain America handcuffed Zemo and told Wilson that he had ten minutes before he did it his way. Wilson then went inside the room and watched the funeral from above, spotting Morgenthau in the crowd. 

Wilson speaking with Karli Morgenthau
Following the funeral, Morgenthau stayed behind, having seen Wilson earlier. Wilson approached Morgenthau and asked to speak with her. He listened to what her and the Flag Smashers' motives were, before saying that he saw their side, but did not agree with how they are achieving their goals.

Wilson learns Karli Morgenthau has escaped
Before he can finish his conversation, Captain America barged into the room, threatening to arrest Morgenthau. However, Morgenthau, feeling that Wilson tricked her, kicked him and Captain America back into a table before escaping. Wilson chased after her and regrouped with Barnes, commenting that the building is like a maze. The two eventually found Captain America and an unconscious Zemo.

Dora Milaje Skirmish
Wilson and Helmut Zemo discuss the serum
Back at the room, Helmut Zemo, who was recovering, asked Wilson if he would ever take the Super Soldier Serum, to which Wilson immediately says no. Zemo then said that super soldiers should not exist, and Wilson reminded him that Bucky Barnes was a super soldier and that his statement was not right. The three are met again by John Walker and Lemar Hoskins who barge into their room, demanding Zemo's arrest, and Walker mocks Wilson by putting down the shield. They are then interupted by the Dora Milaje who arrive to arrest Zemo also.

Wilson attempting to stop the Dora Milaje
Wilson told Walker not to mess with the Dora Milaje after he confronted and watched after Walker and Hoskins began fighting against Ayo, Nomble, and Yama. Shortly, Wilson and Barnes agree to stop the Dora from the unnecessary fighting. Wilson managed to grab onto Yama's spear and try to take it away from her to stop the fight, but got thrown to the ground. After the Dora leave having seen that Zemo escaped, Wilson and Barnes leave too, giving Walker a disaproving look.

Battling the Flag Smashers
Wilson learning his sister was threatened
While walking in the streets with Barnes, Wilson received a phone call from his sister who told him about Karli Morgenthau's threat and demand that he meet with her. Wilson told Bucky Barnes he had to meet alone, but Barnes told him he was coming too.

Falcon arrives to speak to Karli Morgenthau
The two arrived at the location, suited up, and Falcon met with Morgenthau, angry that she called his sister. However, after Falcon heard from Sharon Carter over his communications of John Walker's location coinciding with the Flag Smashers, Wilson took off with his EXO-7 Falcon.

Falcon fights against the Flag Smashers
When Wilson arrived at the building, he witnessed a now enhanced Captain America throw Dovich into a wall and twist a metal pipe with his own hands. Shocked, Falcon asked him what was going on and Captain America told him they had take Battlestar hostage.

Falcon witnesses the death of Battlestar
Falcon followed Captain America into an open courtyard where they are ambushed by the Flag Smashers. Barnes arrived and joined the fight, knocking one Flag Smasher away and jokingly, telling Falcon he was welcome. The fight ended after Morgenthau accidentally killed Battlestar, who was thrown into a column with considerable force. The Flag Smashers ran away from the building, and Walker went to Battlestar before seeing that it was he was dead.

Falcon sees what Captain America has done
Once Captain America realized his friend was dead, he went on an angry rampage, and jumped out the building window to capture Morgenthau. Falcon and Barnes left the building to catch up with Walker, and Falcon watched on outside as Captain America murdered Nico with the shield, staining it with Nico's blood. Falcon and Barnes were horrified and watched as the crowd filmed Walker with their devices.

Taking Back the Shield
Falcon confronts John Walker for the shield
Falcon and Bucky Barnes chased after John Walker and found him in an abandoned warehouse. After confronting him, Falcon finally realizing that Walker is both too unhinged and unfit to use the shield, and told him to hand over the shield, to which Walker refused. 

Falcon fighting against John Walker
As Walker warmed them that they did not want to take this course of action Barnes affirmed to him they were serious about getting it back. With Walker refusing, a fight broke out between the three. After Walker momentarily knocked Barnes out, he duelled with Falcon, eventually getting the upper hand and throwing Falcon to the ground. After the shield was thrown out of Walker's grasp, Falcon rushed to get it, only to get tackled violently by Walker. 

Falcon gets attacked by John Walker
With Falcon overwhelmed, Walker overpowered him and Falcon's EXO-7 Falcon wings were torn off by Walker and, just as Walker was about to kill Falcon with the shield, Barnes rejoined the fight and tackled Walker, leading him away from Falcon. 

Falcon uses the shield against John Walker
The two then managed to grab onto Walker and Falcon used his jet pack to pull the shield out of Walker's hand, breaking his arm in the process. Walker, in pain and enraged, demanded that it was his, and threatened to attack Falcon, holding the shield, but Barnes grabbed him by the legs and Falcon slammed the shield into Walker's back, knocking them all to the ground but incapacitating Walker. Barnes then knocked Walker out for good measure.

Wilson reclaims Captain America's Shield
As Falcon lay on the ground, exhausted, Barnes dropped the shield next to him, before leaving the warehouse. Falcon then followed, trying to wipe Nico's blood off the shield.

Battle Aftermath
Wilson passes his mantle onto Joaquín Torres
Following the fight with John Walker, Wilson and Bucky Barnes had then met with Joaquín Torres at the former Global Repatriation Council resettlement camp, who had arrived in Riga also. After Barnes left them, Torres told Wilson that Karli Morgenthau was getting more followers and that after Walker's incident, they needed to lay low. Wilson agreed and noticed how Torres seemed interested in his wings. He then showed Torres the shield. Afterwards, he left and on his way out, passed on his EXO-7 Falcon mantle to Torres and left Riga for the United States of America with the shield.

Tough Decisions
Reunion with Isaiah Bradley
Wilson being reunited with Eli Bradley
Wilson returned to Baltimore, Maryland to meet with Isaiah Bradley again. While walking on the street to Bradley's house, Wilson ran into Eli Bradley who was outside with friends, Eli told him he would be home shortly after asking Wilson what he was doing there. 

Wilson meets Isaiah Bradley in his backyard
Wilson met Bradley in his backyard, who was watering his plants and started to show him the shield, but Bradley told him he was not interested and took Wilson inside. After going inside, Wilson sat down with Bradley in the living room, who told him about his past as being a black man who was experimented on with the Super Soldier Serum.

Wilson speaking with Isaiah Bradley inside
Bradley got emotional while recounting his past stories. He also told Wilson that he believed that no black man would ever have the shield, even though Wilson couldn't exactly relate to Bradley's stance. After their talk, Wilson left the Bradley's house and once on the street, called his sister telling her he was coming back to Louisiana.

Time With Family
Wilson returning back into Sarah's home
Once back with Sarah at her house, Wilson told her he would ask the community for help in fixing their family boat since Sarah and their mother had done so much for them in the past. He then got out the phone book and made phone calls to their community.

Wilson and Bucky Barnes on Wilson's boat
It was successful, as the community soon gathered to help with their boat. To Wilson's surprise, Bucky Barnes arrived and started helping out right away as well. Barnes then gave Wilson a box that he said was a gift from the Wakandans who he had asked to make it for Wilson. Wilson then watched as Barnes and Sarah met, with Wilson teasing Barnes about not flirting with her.

Wilson and Bucky Barnes work on the boat
As the day was close to ending Barnes prepared to leave telling Wilson he was going to return home as was going to stay at a hotel in the meantime. However, Wilson offered Barnes the chance to stay with them until then which Barnes agreed to. The next few days Barnes stayed with Wilson and helped him fix the boat. As Wilson struggled to fix the boat manually, Barnes would come over every so often and use his vibranium arm to lift heavy objects with much ease, which Wilson was grateful for.

Co-Workers
Wilson begins to practise using the shield
After the boat was repaired, Wilson and Bucky Barnes left the docks and began training with the shield, throwing it back and forth to get used to catching it. While doing so, the two talked and Barnes apologized to Wilson for his initial handling of Wilson handing over the shield to the government. Barnes told him that when and Steve Rogers had talked the night before Rogers handed over his mantly to Wilson, that they never really fully thought through the implications of handing the shield to a black man and that he understood Wilson's decision. In response, Wilson helped Barnes with truly making peace with his actions as the Winter Soldier and the victims of the Winter Soldier's actions. 

Wilson and Bucky Barnes make a friendship
Telling Barnes that he should focus more on helping his victims achieve peace rather than just trying to assuage his own conscious, Barnes agreed with him. As Barnes prepared to leave the two humorously tried to define their relationship claiming that they were not friends or a team but instead partners and coworkers, then shaking hands and recognizing each other as actually friends, Barnes left for New York City.

Accepting The Mantle
Wilson talks to his sister about his decision
The next day as Wilson and Sarah prepared the final touches on the boat to sell it Sarah had a change of heart much to Wilson’s delight. Wilson then told Sarah that his adventures over the past couple of days had taught him to accept he can’t win every battle but that in this case preserving everything of their parents and family history was a fight they simply could not lose. Wilson then told Sarah that in the past he could tell that the more he fought to change the world for the better the more he knew Sarah believed he was running away from their family. 

Wilson finally making his decision
However, Sarah told him that was untrue and that at no point in her life did she ever believe Wilson was running away from them and assured her brother that she has always been proud of him for fighting not only to make the world better but also for their family. Sarah then told Wilson that he should not let what Isaiah Bradley told him deter him from making his own decisions on what to do with the shield. Wilson however reminded her that Bradley had gone through essentially torture throughout his life and that if in his exact same position he would probably have the same outlook on life, but acknowledged that if he wasn’t willing to push through and keeping fighting then all the pain and sacrifices that they have all made would be for nothing. 

Wilson throwing and catching the shield
Now fully ready to accept the mantle that Steve Rogers had passed on to him, Wilson spent the next few days training with the shield and pushing his body to its absolute potential, doing pushups and running. While he initially struggled with the throwing of the shield and catching it on the return, eventually Wilson managed to master both. 

Wilson looking at his brand new Uniform
Later on, Wilson got a video-call from Joaquín Torres. Torres told him got an alert from followers of the Flag Smashers in New York City as Wilson watched the WHiH World News report of the GRC voting on the Patch Act that would relocate millions of refugees back to their countries of origin. Wilson realized that Karli Morgenthau and the Flag Smashers planned on attacking there and so, he prepared to suit up, opening the box from the Wakandans that Barnes had given him, in which was a new Captain America suit and a new pair of wings.

Captain America
Rescue of the GRC Members
Captain America arrives inside the GRC Hall
Before he left, Captain America called Sharon Carter asking her for backup. While flying to New York City in his new Captain America suit, Captain America joined communications with Bucky Barnes. Nearing the buidling, Captain America threw the shield at one of the Flag Smashers inside the GRC Meeting Hall. By doing this, the glass window shattered, thus allowing him to get in. Inside, Captain America was then asked by a man who he was, to which he replied, "I'm Captain America" and then deduced that evacuating the building was a misdirect. 

Captain America fighting Georges Batroc
Captain America then suddenly got hit backwards by a masked man who revealed himself to be Georges Batroc. Batroc told him that he still owed him losts of money after the Rescue of Captain Vassant, and then engaged Captain America in a fight. As he was fighting, Captain America remained in communications with Barnes and Carter. When Carter reported that a Flag Smasher was escaping with a helicopter containing GRC hostages, Captain America threw his shield through another glass window, breaking it, and flew out to retrieve it in the air.

Captain America rescues all of the officers
Captain America then saved two NYPD officers, in a helicopter which had just been damaged. Captain America deployed a newly constructed Redwing that saved the pilot, and Captain America rescued the other officer. After safely placing them on a road, Captain America flew off to intercept the other helicopter.

Captain America helps GRC members on a helicopter
Captain America then flew off to the helicopter that contained hostages. He used his new Redwing drones to find out if any of the members knew how to fly. After finding out that a woman named Ayla Perez did, Captain America sent a message to her phone and told her to put her headphones in. After she did, Captain America told Perez to prepare to get ready to take over the helicopter. Captain America then flew after the helicopter, but was diverted into metal pipes which fell down into the Hudson River below. Captain America fell as well and managed to dodge the pipes as he swam out of the water. Picking up energy, Captain America then flew back and then used the shield to strike Diego, the Flag Smasher in the control seat and quickly grabbed him out of the helicopter. After a brief struggle with Diego, Captain America dropped him in the Hudson River. He then complimented Perez on managing the helicopter after she successfully landed.

Final Fight with Flag Smashers
Captain America rescues the GRC hostages
Captain America then observed the situation and swooped down to the construction site and used his Redwing drones to assist him as he stopped the armored truck containing GRC hostages inside from falling to the ground. He then used the thrusters from his new suit to further help him. After he had made sure the hostages were safe, Captain America then flew back down to the riverbank. 

Captain America confronts the Flag Smashers
Using the shield, Captain America knocked out Karli Morgenthau and the other Flag Smashers, before standing alongside Bucky Barnes and John Walker. Morgenthau then took off her Flag Smasher mask and approached Captain America, criticizing him for having taken on the mantle. Captain America told her he was trying something different and that she should as well. They were interrupted when Georges Batroc arrived and shot smoke bombs at the ground, allowing for the Flag Smashers to escape. Captain America then led Barnes and Walker deeper into the construction site underneath the building.

Captain America chases the Flag Smashers
Captain America, Barnes, and Walker ran through the construction site, trying to find the Flag Smashers, when Sharon Carter called and gave them an update. It was then determined that they would split up to find the Flag Smashers quicker, with Captain America going solo, while Barnes left with Walker. 

Captain America confronts Karli Morgenthau
After hearing a gunshot, Captain America was able to locate where it came from and found Karli Morgenthau holding a gun at Sharon Carter, who was on the floor and injured. Captain America asked Morgenthau how many more people had to die and what she was willing to do for her goal, getting her to get away from Carter. Morgenthau then engaged in a fight with him, but Captain America was able to dodge and flip his way from her blows, telling her that fighting wasn't the answer, but she had an irrational tantrum and knocked Captain America to the ground.

Captain America comforts Karli Morgenthau
After he was separated from the shield, Morgenthau got out her gun and pointed it at him. Captain America tensed up at the situation and then witnessed Morgenthau double over after getting shot by Carter. Captain America lifted Morgenthau into his arms as she died and heard her tell him that she was sorry. After exchanging glances over the situation with Carter, Captain America left the site and flew down to where the rescued GRC members were, carrying Morgenthau's body.

Public Message
Captain America carrying Karli Morgenthau
As Captain America landed with Karli Morgenthau's body in his arms, the paramedics then rushed over and put Morgenthau's body on a stretcher and took her away to the ambulance. Captain America then walked past news reporters and photographers with some crying out asking what to call him and that the government hadn't approved of him yet. He was then thanked by the Government Official, Ayla Perez, and another GRC member for his role in saving them.

Captain America makes his public message
However, he then explained to them that they as a whole should do better in helping everyone equally, since the Blip had affected everyone. He then noted that that was a reason why Morgenthau had started her movement to begin with. The Government Official told him that he didn't understand what the GRC did and how it worked, but Captain America laughed and said that he understood. Captain America said he understood now that a black man can take on Captain America mantle and that it didn't matter what he looked like in order to do so. He then told them that they as a governing body had a lot of power. He said that because of this they affected people, so much as that of Thanos and Morgenthau. Captain America then said that all he could do was believe that America could do better.

After walking away from the GRC members, Captain America saw John Walker and exchanged nods with him. He was then met by Bucky Barnes.

Carter then told Captain America that she liked his new suit to which he thanked her. Captain America was then asked by a GRC employee to retrieve Diego, who had been dropped in the river earlier. Before flying away, he told Carter he would still get her the pardon from the U.S. government. He then flew away and picked up the last Flag Smasher, taking him back to the police.

Personality
Sam Wilson is one of Steve Rogers' most stalwart friends and allies. Both men found a kindred spirit in each other when they discovered they both shared common life experiences and had similar values. Sam Wilson and Rogers both fought for the United States of America by joining the military, had to cope with the deaths of friends during war, and had to adjust to life outside of war. For Wilson, he found purpose in helping military veterans adjust to civilian life. This earned Rogers' respect, and in turn Wilson admires Captain America and the ideals he represents. Their commonality helped the two to forge a bond that led Wilson to aid Steve Rogers in many of his heroic exploits. During these exploits, Sam Wilson becomes a hero in his own right, whether it be when the two are fighting shoulder to shoulder together during a mission to save the world or aiding Rogers with a personal matter, such as helping him find the Winter Soldier.

In contrast to Rogers' pensive no-nonsense attitude, Wilson often displays a more brazen attitude and a strong sense of humor, often making cheeky comments; he jokingly tells Rogers to come by the VA to make him look good in front of a girl at the desk, and nods in approval when Rogers and Sharon Carter kiss. However, similarly to Rogers, Wilson is also a hardened soldier who, during battle, believes strongly in focusing on the job at hand, bluntly telling Spider-Man that during fights people don't tend to talk much when his adversary started admiring his EXO-suit. Some of Wilson's hardened attitude comes from losing his wingman, Riley, which led to him leaving the military. In addition, he also takes great pride in his work, both when he helps veterans who suffer from PTSD and his work as Falcon, and is visibly embarrassed following his defeat at the hands of Ant-Man, though later jokes about this at their next encounter.

Unlike many of his teammates, Wilson doesn't hold grudges and believes in forming his own opinions of others instead of going by what others think. He respects Scott Lang following their initial meeting despite much of the public believing him to be nothing more than a common criminal, and following their battle at Leipzig airport is the only one of Rogers' captured teammates who doesn't show any ill will toward Tony Stark when he visits his former teammates and admits to Wilson that he was wrong, suggesting the two of them both understand why the other did what they did and still hold some mutual respect for one another.

Wilson also shares many characteristics and similarities to his friend and mentor Steve Rogers, being deeply compassionate and empathetic towards others, as well as having a strong moral code. He is able to understand and relate to the motivations and frustrations of Flag Smasher, stating that he supports the noble nature of her cause, but that he cannot support her violent ways. Wilson firmly believes that violence does not make the world a better place, to which Morgentau suggests that he is either brilliant or hopelessly optimistic. Despite Baron Zemo's constant efforts to convince Wilson that the only way to stop the Flag Smashers is by killing Morgentau, Wilson stands firm by his beliefs that the group can be stopped peacefully. After finding out that Sharon Carter was still in hiding for helping Wilson, Rogers and Barnes during the Avengers Civil War, Wilson is deeply stricken and appalled by what she had to experience, promising that he will personally make sure that she gets pardoned for her crimes. 

Due to his previous occupation as a counselor at the VA, Wilson serves as a good advisor and a motivational speaker, being able to understand and help Bucky Barnes with his mental struggles and trauma, giving him a few helpful advises on how he should be making amends for his past crimes. Wilson's understanding nature has helped evolve his initial rivalry with Barnes into friendship. Despite not initially agreeing with Isaiah Bradley's beliefs about the legacy of Captain America's Shield, Wilson was still deeply stricken by Bradley's tragic history, even going as far as briefly entertaining the thought of destroying the shield. However, after learning about the importance of the shield and it's legacy during the conversation with Bucky Barnes, Wilson's mind about the shield has changed. So much so, that he willingly took the shield and became the new Captain America to protect his country. Sam has a deep connection to his family's legacy, constantly trying convince Sarah Wilson not to sell their old family boat, despite their ever increasing financial troubles, firmly believing that things like legacy, history and righteous causes are worth fighting for.

Powers and Abilities
EXO-7 Falcon Capabilities
Although Wilson does not possess any innate powers, he is granted several abilities through his use of the EXO-7 Falcon, which he uses to great effect.

Wilson flying over New York City
Flight: Using his specialized winged jetpack, Sam Wilson is able to fly at high speeds with an enhanced degree of maneuverability and agility similar to that of an actual falcon. The impressive agility afforded by the jetpack and his own knowledge on flying enabled him to avoid automatic fire from an Insight Quinjet and the shots of the Insight Helicarriers' main weaponry. While flying, he was able to lift up and carry off people like Jasper Sitwell and Steve Rogers. With his vibranium suit, Wilson was able to support and lift a truck with multiple people inside.
Extreme Force Generation: When moving at high speeds, Falcon is capable of utilizing his momentum and weight to generate large amounts of force, such as when he threw a helicopter off course to prevent it from shooting Bucky Barnes, knocked back Iron Man during the Clash of the Avengers, sending Proxima Midnight flying into a store front during the Attack on Vision, slamming a Chitauri Gorilla to the ground, or flooring Karli Morgenthau with a powerful kick.
