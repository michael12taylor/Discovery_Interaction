<html><p>Joy suggested that even if Rand was telling the truth that the attack had taken place, then maybe Shannon had done this himself without following anybody else's orders. She then noted how Ward was a man who saw the world in facts or lies, while she was a little more open minded, noting that Rand looked like the person he said he was, despite Danny Rand dying in a Plane Crash, suggesting there was a hint that he could possibly be telling the truth. Joy then began calling Rand by Danny and offered to answer his questions as best she could, noting she also had a lot of questions for him.

Rand is drugged by Ward and Joy Meachum
Drinking the tea, Rand then started explaining what had happened the day of the plane crash, recalling witnessing his mother's death before the plane crashed and his father was also killed upon impact. Just as he was telling the story, however, Rand realized he was losing focus and figured out that Joy has drugged his tea. Rand collapsed onto the floor as Joy and Ward looked down at him as they prepared to have him committed for trespassing and harassment of them, and Rand briefly hallucinated the time when Chodak and Tashi had found him in the snowy mountains shortly following the plane crash.

Institutionalized
Detained for Seventy Two Hours
Rand awakens at Birch Psychiatric Hospital
When Rand finally awoke, he had found himself tied to a bed and Simon watching over him. Upon asking about his current location, it was revealed that he was at Birch Psychiatric Hospital, as Rand insisted that he should not be there and discovered he was tied to the bed, as Simon refused to untie him since he heard Rand could put up a fight, although Rand had promised him that he was not actually dangerous, although Simon refused to accept this.

Rand watching Simon trying to stab him
As Rand insisted that he needed to get out, Simon attempted to reassure him, claiming that he understood that it must be confusing to wake up in such a strange location, promising that they could help them. Standing over him, Simon, who was actually a patient there acting as an orderly, grew disturbed and insisted that Rand needed to kill himself in order to gain any help, holding a fork at Rand's throat. Before anything could happen, the staff members, including Joe and Smith arrived to take Simon away. Rand was given drugs and had then quietly drifted off into unconsciousness.

Rand is introduced to Doctor Paul Edmonds
While Rand was meditating in his room, later on, he had gained some peace by recalling being back within K'un-Lun and meditating on top of the mountains, until he had then become disturbed by recalling the details of his Plane Crash and then awoke to find Paul Edmonds was currently sitting beside him. When he asked if he woke him up, Rand explained that he was trying to recharge his Chi to get out of there, noting that the drugs were stopping him from gaining his full abilities. Rand again requested that his straps be removed, and Edmonds had agreed once Rand had promised that he would behave himself.

Rand explaining the Himalayan Plane Crash
Having removed just one of the restraints, Edmonds asked for his name, to which Rand insisted that he was Danny Rand, as Edmonds compared the name to the rich child who died in the plane crash, not believing Rand was telling the truth. Although Rand insisted he was being honest, the doctor did not believe him, asking him to tell him more details, as Rand explained in great detail how after his mother and father had been killed, he then awoke in the snow until he was found by Chodak and Tashi, the monks from the Order of the Crane Mother who had then managed to save his life.

Rand quickly dismisses faking his identity
Changing the subject, Edmonds then asked Rand about John Anderson, as he showed Rand a passport with Rand's photo on it with Anderson's name. The doctor explained that he was John Anderson of Toronto from Canada, although Rand denied any knowledge about the passport, though he was actually lying and had stolen the passport from Morocco to get back into the United States of America. The doctor explained that if Rand wanted to get out of the hospital, he needed to start being honest before leaving him tied down and still furiously struggling to break himself free.

Birch Hospital Tour
Rand walks around the hospital with Simon
Having finally been released from his bed straps, Rand was visited by both Joe and Simon, as Simon had been tasked to give him a tour around Birch Psychiatric Hospital, much to Rand's displeasure as Simon had earlier attempted to kill him while he was still tied down onto the bed. As Rand questioned if he planned on attempting to stab him again, Simon then apologized for his action and blamed it on stress before inviting Rand to follow him to begin the tour.

Rand being introduced to all other patients
He then toured Rand around the facility and told him a little bit about some of the patients in the facility, including Dink who he claimed had killed his parents with a hammer and Leo who fried his brain with methamphetamines. As they kept walking, Dink purposely pushed into Rand although Simon insisted that he should just let the insult go as it was not worth getting into a fight with Dink. As Simon showed Rand to his new room, Rand still insisted that he would be out in seventy-two hours, to which Simon chuckled and explained that the patients here including him have been inside for years.

Rand being bullied and threatened by Dink
Stepping into the leisure room of the hospital, Simon pointed out himself as well as Billy and Jimmy who had all been given a seventy-two hour stay which turned into years, as Rand realized it was urgent to get out. When Simon made an off-hand comment comparing the patients to being like drugged up donkeys, he had accidentally angered Dink. When he insisted Rand have to apologize as well, Rand refused and got into a brief fight, in which Rand easily subdued Dink by throwing him to the floor with considerable each, which had resulted in the guards immediately taking Rand away.

Rand telling Simon that he needs his help
Having been taken away by the doctors, Rand was strapped back down to a bed inside his room where he was forced to take several more drugs again. Simon came to visit and asked if he was alright, with Rand taking notice that Simon was the first person to call him by his real first name since he arrived. Simon asked Rand if there was any family that he could call, and when that was not an option, Simon asked if there were any friends he could call instead. Remembering that there was one person that he could call, Rand asked for Simon's help to release the straps so he could make a call.

Rand calls Colleen Wing to ask for her help
With Simon agreeing to help and with only one option open to him, Rand then called Colleen Wing at the Chikara Dojo, although she was briefly confused over who was calling her. He explained his situation and asked for her help and, when she questioned why he was calling her, Rand told her that she was the only one in New York City who had not shown him hostility or had attempted to kill him and Joy and Ward Meachum had done. Despite Rand's plead to her to speak with the Meachums, Wing apologized and hung up the phone, simply unwilling to put her life on the line to help a stranger.

Speaking to Dr. Edmonds
Rand meditating while inside the hospital
Back in his room, Rand tried to meditate and recharge his Chi, once again thinking back to being in K'un-Lun and meditating there until he once again had then become disturbed by recalling the details of his Plane Crash, including the death of his father. When Rand opened his eyes, he found Paul Edmonds had entered his room wishing once again to speak with Rand and get closer to the truth, as they discussed the drugs he was being given which Rand said made him feel like he was underwater as he was getting a high dose.

Rand tells the truth about his fake passport
Rand revealed that he lied about the passport, however, he still denied that he was John Anderson, confessing that he had bought the passport in Morocco with the intention of getting back to the United States of America. Once again, Rand insisted that he was not John Anderson, but that he was Danny Rand. However, once again Edmonds had refused to believe him, telling Rand that they would discuss this in their next session before leaving the room as Joe then entered the room and gave Rand his medicine which he took willingly to avoid having it forced down his throat.

Rand relives a Rand Enterprises commercial
Later during the day, Edmonds called Rand into his office in order to show him a Rand Enterprises commercial from around fifteen years earlier. As it started, Rand immediately recognized the commercial that he once did with his parents and the Meachums while Edmonds explained his belief that Rand was, in fact, fantasizing that he was part of a wealthy family. Rand calmly reminisced about how he was convinced to partake in the commercial by his father who promised to take him to the circus in Madison Square Garden afterward as he sat next to his mother with Joy Meachum sat beside him.

Rand being pinned down by staff members
Unwilling to hear more of what he still believed were lies, Edmonds insisted that Rand was John Anderson. At his wit's end, Rand proceeded to furiously smash his computer screen as he once again insisted that his name was not John Anderson but Danny Rand. Having heard the computer being smashed and his furious outburst, several staff members, including Joe had then arrived into Doctor Edmonds' office to take Rand away, as they injected Rand with more drugs and dragged him out of the office and back into his room where he could sleep off his anger.

Vision of Harold Meachum
Rand being visited by Harold Meachum
At night, Rand was strapped back down onto his bed where he was then drugged once more by Joe and was left to go to sleep to calm down in the wake of his outburst against Doctor Paul Edmonds after his claims of being Danny Rand had once again been rejected by everybody around him. However, as Rand was about to go to sleep, he then saw a vision of the now-deceased Harold Meachum who was looking down at him beside his bed, much to the great shock and confusion of Rand who still believed that Meachum had died.

Rand listens to Harold Meachum's singing
Believing him to be a hallucination, Rand listened as Meachum reminded Rand about how he used to sing the song Danny Boy to get on his nerves, quietly singing the song while the still drugged up Rand tried to understand what was happening. Confused by the appearance of Meachum, Rand answered his questions, telling him all about how he had been found by the Order of the Crane Mother and then taken back to K'un-Lun, noting that he should have never left to return to New York City as he at least had understood what his place was back in K'un-Lun unlike in New York.

Rand tells Harold Meachum about K'un-Lun
Meachum asked about his position in K'un-Lun, as Rand explained that he was a warrior while noting his own ascension of a long line of the Iron Fists, the sworn enemy of the Hand. This answer intrigued Meachum as he continued asking more questions about both the Iron Fist and the Hand, as Rand explained that it was his sworn duty to destroy the Hand, as Meachum seemed excited by the prospect of finding the one destined to destroy the Hand. Rand pleaded Meachum to finally get him out of the Birch Psychiatric Hospital as Meachum reassured Rand that he would take care of it.

Gaining New Allies
Rand meditating in his room to recharge chi
The next day, Rand was once again attempting to meditate inside of his room within the Birch Psychiatric Hospital, practicing his martial arts poses to attempt to focus and regain his Chi once again, but had still found himself struggling to focus on being back at K'un-Lun when all he could see in his mind was the Plane Crash which had killed his mother and father right in front of him, causing him to finally break concentration, much to Rand's great frustration at failing yet again to regain his Chi.

Rand placing the M&Ms inside the envelope
Rand sat on the bed when Joe came into his room and delivered a package that was sent by Joy Meachum to Rand himself, much to Rand's considerable surprise. As he opened it, he found Meachum had only sent him a bag of M&Ms without any other note attached. Realizing this could finally convince her about his true identity, Rand had immediately started picking out all the brown M&Ms which he had always done when they were younger, something which would have been impossible for anyone to research about their relationship and therefore the way to prove that he was actually Danny Rand.

Rand speaks to Colleen Wing about freedom
While Rand continued with his task, Joe returned and informed Rand that he had a visitor. Believing it was Meachum, Rand went to the meeting room to find Colleen Wing waiting for him. Sitting down, Rand explained how the doctors there were giving him all kinds of drugs in order to keep him safe, while Rand noted that he had not expected to see Wing and asked if she had figured out a way to get him free. Wing, however, questioned why Ward Meachum would have visited the Chikara Dojo in order to get her to sign some paperwork which had claimed that Rand was a dangerous individual.

Rand asks Colleen Wing to return the M&Ms
Rand noted that the Meachums though that he was a threat to their current position within Rand Enterprises as he owned at least half of the company. Wing laughed at this explanation, noting that there was no chance of the answer ever being simple, before telling him that the Meachums were attempting to bribe for to betray Rand. Wing questioned if Rand was dangerous, to which he promised he was only dangerous to the Meachums, also insisting that he had always told Wing the truth since meeting her. When they were done talking, Rand asked for to return the package to Joy.

Ordered to Stay
Rand at his meeting with Paul Edmonds
With his seventy-two hours within Birch Psychiatric Hospital almost done with, Rand was again visited by Paul Edmonds as Rand insisted that it was almost time for him to be allowed to walk free of the hospital at long last. Edmonds began asking questions that only Danny Rand would know, including where he had gone to school and who his extra teachers were, all of which Rand answered without any hesitation. After answering all of his questions, Edmonds believed Rand's story, although he was still confused and shocked that it could have actually happened.

Rand explains K'un-Lun to Paul Edmonds
In his joy for finally having someone who believed what he had been saying at long last, Rand had then started excitedly talking about K'un-Lun and the Iron Fist, as Rand explained that K'un-Lun was not located in China as Edmonds had assumed but was within another dimension which could only be accessed every fifteen years, as Rand noted this was where he had learned to focus his Chi energy and summon the Iron Fist. When Edmonds questioned if he was either Danny Rand or the Iron Fist, Rand had simply answered that he was, in fact, both of these at the same time.

Rand stating that he is indeed the Iron Fist
All of these statements, however, had only convinced Edmonds that Rand had instead been suffering from a psychotic disorder due to the trauma of barely surviving his Plane Crash and witnessing the deaths of his mother and father right in front of him, noting that he believed Rand had suffered for a long time since this incident, claiming that Rand had created a false reality to cope with the trauma, claiming the Iron Fist was a lie. Although Rand insisted he was telling the truth and needed to go free, Edmonds claimed that for his own safety, Rand had to remain and begin his treatment.

Escaping Birch Facility
Rand is walked down the hallways by Joe
Later at night, Joe had arrived inside Rand's bedroom where he was relaxing having taken his drugs for the evening, as Joe then informed Rand that he was being moved into another room and that he had to put a straitjacket on, claiming that it was part of the new rules. While Rand was moved, he was led into a room where Dink was waiting for him alongside Leo, and Tony, as they all had immediately started brutally beating him down with sticks, as Ward Meachum had just arranged for them to do so in order to finally get Rand out of the picture once and for all.

Rand is beaten by other mental patients
As one of the men held Rand upright, Dink took charge of hitting him repeatedly with strong strikes to the stomach and head while Rand remained trapped in his straightjacket and currently unable to defend himself. However, the pain of the beating helped Rand focus his Chi as he concentrated and getting ready to free himself, as the effects of the drugs had less of an impact on his mind and body. Once Rand was kicked in the face and knocked over, Dink had him picked up and held up Rand's face, telling him that Meachum sent his regards before preparing to hit him again.

Rand channels the Iron Fist to help escape
Having had it confirmed that Meachum was the one responsible for attempting to have him killed, Rand gained enough Chi energy get out of his drugged state and achieve enough focus to summon the Iron Fist. With the enhanced strength gained from his powers, Rand released himself from his straitjacket and defeated his attackers with considerable ease, knocking them all unconscious with well-placed kicks to the face. Elated that he got his powers back, Rand looked up at the Moon and saw a hawk flying across it, while he waited until Joe had returned in order to open the door.

Rand breaks himself out of the hospital
Pushing Joe out of his yet, Rand had then immediately headed for the exit so that he could finally leave Birch Psychiatric Hospital and then return to New York City to take back Rand Enterprises. He had soon found the metal door that barred him from his freedom, as he had then charged ahead with the Iron Fist at full strength, running straight past Simon before he used the Iron Fist to smash the metal door away with incredible force. Taking a moment to take his breath and allow the Iron Fist to vanish, Rand left the hospital in the night as he prepared to confront the Meachums over their actions.

Retaking Rand Enterprises
Staying with Colleen Wing
Rand hides on the ceiling from Shannon's men
Having made his escape from Birch Psychiatric Hospital, Rand had then found refuge back in Chikara Dojo. However, shortly after arriving, Rand had witnessed Colleen Wing taking care of Shannon and his accomplice when they broke into the dojo in order to look for Rand. In an attempt to hide from Shannon and his men, Rand hid on the ceiling, balancing his weight while Wing fought against the intruders and demanded they leave, as Shannon told her to call him if she heard where Rand was currently hiding.

Rand apologizes to Colleen Wing at night
Once Wing had driven them away, Rand got out of his hiding place and apologized for bringing more drama into Wing's life, noting that Shannon had broken the door lock to get inside the dojo.  Rand promised that he would make it up to Wing, who questioned if the New York City Police Department would be coming looking for Rand, although he insisted that he had not actually broken any laws. Noting how she had put herself on the line to keep him out of harm's way, Wing had then told Rand that she wanted him out of her dojo by the morning as she then went back to bed.

Rand meditating inside the Chikara Dojo
The next morning, however, Rand did not leave and instead had remained at the dojo and played loud hip-hop music as he mediated. Darryl entered and was bewildered by Rand's meditation, while Wing expressed her irritation and ordered him to turn off the music. Shutting off the music, Wing asked why Rand was not gone as instructed, as Rand explained that he was worried about her safety, which was why he stayed. She insisted that she did not need him to protect her, to which Rand lectured Wing about the flaws in her style, noting how one of Shannon's men had been able to hit her.

Rand and Colleen Wing have a sparring match
Annoyed at being told how she should fight by somebody who she did not know nor respected, Wing had then attempted to punch at Rand to which he evaded with ease, having just predicted the strike would be coming. The two had the brief spar while Darryl continued watching with complete surprise and awe, all the while Rand lectured about her fighting style, telling Wing that she was still using too much external strength rather than internal force as he had learned in K'un-Lun; however, Wing simply told him to be quiet as she had continued trying and failing to land just one single blow against Rand.

Rand tells Colleen Wing he'll pay for rent
Rand easily won the spar by landing a leopard punch on Wing before flipping her onto her back as he explained to her the concept of harnessing her Chi to gain inner strength which would help her to become a superior fighter. Getting to her feet, Wing still insisted that he needed to go, however, he suggested that he instead pay her six months' rent to let him stay for just a week, reminding her that he was, in fact, Danny Rand and would be able to afford this. Eventually, after some persuasion and the promise to also fix her front door, Rand managed to convince Wing to let him stay longer.

Rejecting 100 Million Dollars
Rand waits for Joy Meachum for a brief talk
Later during the day, Rand set up a Buddha tradition of flowers and oranges while he had waited for Joy Meachum outside the Meachum Residence. Seeing the display, Meachum noted how this could be considered romantic, while Rand noted that in another life she would not have drugged him and sent him to Birch Psychiatric Hospital, as Rand commented that they had once been friends and that he wished for them to rebuild that relationship they had once had.

Rand tries to make peace with Joy Meachum
Now convinced that it was really Danny Rand, Meachum had then sat down with Rand and start conversing and catching up, questioning where he had been for so long as Rand would only tell her that his story following the Plane Crash was complicated. As they spoke, Rand noted how his connection to Joy and Ward Meachum was the only thing keeping him in New York City which he needed. Meachum then opened up as she explained that when Harold Meachum had died when she was just thirteen she had felt lost, as it had so closely followed the deaths of Rand and his family.

Rand spiritually talking to Joy Meachum
Meachum continued explaining how in her grief of losing her father, she would often dream about seeing him waiting for her at her school gates before she woke up and remembered that he was dead. Rand then confessed that he had recently had his own dream about Harold while he was being treated in the hospital, noting how he had been told in K'un-Lun how a ghost like that was wondering the spirit world following their death, although Rand did note that he had been put on a lot of drugs while at the hospital which may have affected the dreams that he had experienced there.

Rand is given paperwork for a suspicious bribe
As Meachum then invited Rand inside the house to continue their talk, she explained that following the deaths of her father and Wendell Rand, she and her brother had both inherited Rand Enterprises on their own and she now felt a responsibility to keep it safe and running. Meachum then handed Rand some paperwork and offered Rand a check for one hundred million dollars to buy his silence and take his percentage of the company, noting that Ward had only wanted to offer Rand forty million but Meachum had managed to convince him to go higher with the amount that was offered.

Rand angrily rejects Joy Meachum's bribe
Rand, however, was disgusted as he realized part of the deal required him to change his real name, as Meachum noted that the rest of the world believed that Danny Rand was dead and it would make everything considerably more complicated if this changed. Disappointed by Meachum's request, having come to be acknowledged and accepted by the Meachums who he considered to be his only family left in the world, Rand left the residence in anger, insisting that this situation simply had nothing to do with money, noting that he had thought she of all people would understand this.

Rand visiting his own family's gravestones
Having walked away from the Meachum's residence, Rand went to visit the Rand Memorial. While he was taking some time to respect and mourn his mother and father, Rand had eventually noticed that the memorial dedicated to his own lost family was still incredibly well maintained and someone had also clearly been delivering some new flowers to the Memorial. Rand asked the nearby gardener about who delivered the flowers, as he was then directed to the office where he learned that Jeri Hogarth was the one who had been maintaining the Rand Memorial for all the years following their sudden deaths.

Recruiting Jeri Hogarth
Rand being reunited back with Jeri Hogarth
That evening, while outside Hogarth, Chao & Benowitz, Rand just spotted Jeri Hogarth as she leaving her firm. When Rand approached closer, Hogarth had turned around and threaten to spray Rand with peeper spray, believing him to be a would-be attacker. Rand tried to convince Hogarth that he was Danny Rand as he called her by a nickname that he gave her, J-Money, while she was an intern at Rand Enterprises. Hogarth was hesitant to believe Rand as she asked Rand a few personal questions, which Rand answered correctly.

Rand thanks Jeri Hogarth for her help
Moving into Central Park to continue their talk now that she believed this was indeed Danny Rand, Hogarth explained that she had been handling their estate ever since the Plane Crash and that included taking care of the Memorial as Rand thanked Hogarth for her help, to which she said it was a small matter since she was grateful for Wendell Rand for giving her first job. Explaining that she had a complicated relationship with Ward and Joy Meachum, Hogarth told Rand that they needed to find every possible evidence in order to prove his identity as the Meachums would work against them.

Rand agrees to the case given by Jeri Hogarth
Rand noted that the Meachums had once been his friends before they had turned against him, as Hogarth noted that she could help Rand get his company back but could not help him to make friends. When Rand asked how much it will cost for Hogarth's service, she gently replied that he did not need to pay her service besides making sure that her firm will be a permanent retainer for Rand Enterprises. As Rand noted he was staying in the Chikara Dojo, Hogarth offered Rand a suite to stay in, in order for him to maintain a low profile, as well as some money to buy new clothes before leaving.

Rand gives a lesson to Colleen Wing's class
Returning back to Chikara Dojo, Rand had then witnessed a practice session with Colleen Wing's students. Rand initially just watched, but when Caleb started fooling around and ignoring Darryl's instructions, old habits from his master's teaching kicked in as Rand grabbed the nearby wooden sword and demanded order and respect among the students. Rand tried to lecture the students, telling them how to draw strength from their breathing and become better warriors; however, Caleb refused to listen and started mocking him, to which Rand then responded by striking the student on the leg and knocking him down, much to Wing's horror who saw this and came to Caleb's aid.

Rand ashamedly apologizes to Colleen Wing
Inside of Wing's living room, Wing was infuriated by Rand's actions in beating down one of her own students as she furiously questioned who had put Rand in charge of her dojo, while Rand had then retaliated by asking if Wing was training kindergarten students or warriors. However, Wing retorted that she was trying to provide a safe place for her student who is regularly bullied and beaten by family and bullies, and now they had to be fearful of a bully at their dojo as well. Ashamed, Rand apologized for his actions as Wing once again demanded for him to leave her dojo.

Rand settles down in a suite from Jeri Hogarth
Staying at the suite that Hogarth had provided for him which gave him a stunning view of New York City, Rand had still felt unfamiliar and uncomfortable by this sort of lifestyle. He could not sleep on the bed, having spent years sleeping on the hard floor while in K'un-Lun. He eventually laid a blanket on the floor near a window in order to comfortably sleep. As he slowly fell asleep, Rand briefly remembered about his time in K'un-Lun, recalling the Order of the Crane Mother training him to become a warrior by repeatedly striking him with wooden sticks in order to help him learn to endure pain.

Destruction of the Files
Rand talks to Jeri Hogarth about his records
The next morning, Rand met up with Jeri Hogarth as she bought him a coffee and explained that their case was more of a challenge than she had expected since there was no evidence about him anywhere. Hogarth suspected that the Meachums are behind it as they were trying to bury the evidence before they could move forward with their own case as Hogarth warned that if they had no definitive proof, they would lose. When kids passed by with their skateboard, Rand remembered a time where he went to Metro-General Hospital following being injured while using a skateboard.

Rand enters a room for his hospital records
Rand had then headed straight over to the hospital where he once visited following his injury all the way back in July, 2001, hoping that the doctors records on this would not have been found by the Meachums and therefore could provide Rand with the evidence that he needed to prove his identity and finally retake Rand Enterprises from them. When Rand had entered the record room, he found it was almost completely empty with only Kevin Singleton in there as Rand asked if he knew anything about his record, as Singleton claimed that he would be willing to help Rand to find what he needed.

Rand breaks Kevin Singleton's brass knuckles
When he was briefly distracted while looking for the files and explaining what they had contained, Singleton had then punched Rand directly at the back of his head while wearing knuckle dusters, knocking Rand down. While Rand lay injured on the floor, he had then witnessed Singleton starting to dose the entire room with Ethyl in order to burn down all the records. Barely keeping himself consciousness, Rand managed to concentrate by focusing on his Chi and summoning the Iron Fist, as he then got to his feet and punched Singleton's man, destroying his knuckle dusters and breaking his hand.

Rand is attacked by Kevin Singleton
However the force of the first punch to the head had quickly caused Rand to lose focus as the Iron Fist faded away, allowing Singleton to grab his lighter and attempt to burn down the files; however, Rand was able to kick away the lighter. Singleton then drew his knife, as Rand was then forced to fight against Singleton. While Rand was dazed and Singleton was injured, the fight became evenly matched, as Rand then used a book to defend himself from the blade before Singleton dropped a filing cabinet down on Rand while attempting to relocate his lighter so he could complete his mission, while Rand still attempted to stop him as their furious fight had still continued.

Rand quickly escapes from the burning room
During the fight however, Rand had gained the upper as he finally kicked Singleton down to the ground, only for Singleton to then find his lighter which he had then used to finally light the room on fire. While Singleton then ran away, Rand then noticed an unconscious woman nearby who had been attacked and left behind by Singleton. Focusing on saving the woman rather than his own files, Rand had then managed to save her in time before the gas exploded and destroyed the records, as Rand looked behind him at the burning room in complete and utter horror as he then considered his next move.

Rand discusses Ward Meachum's attack
Convinced that they were the ones responsible for destroying all records of his existence before the Plane Crash, Rand then went to look for the Meachums in order to confront them over this. He found them in a restaurant where they were discussing Rand Enterprises's dealings as Rand, angered at the Ward Meachum's actions, sat down at their table and furiously voiced his disbelief at Ward as he knew that Ward was the only person with him the day he broke his arm and the only one who knew about it, telling that he used to regard him as a brother he looked up to despite his bullying.

Rand angrily argues and leaves the restaurant
When Rand questioned if Ward really hated him this much, Ward agreed because he insisted that the Danny Rand he had known was dead and he wanted him to stay that way, which resulted in Rand smashing glass before Joy Meachum got between them as they prepared to fight. As Rand and Ward sized each other up, Joy told Rand that Ward was not his brother and she was not his sister and they did not want him at their company. Rand told them that he had Hogarth's help and they were coming for them, before Rand told them that they could not deny his birthright and left the restaurant.

Retaking Rand Enterprises
Rand enters the building with Jeri Hogarth
The next morning, Rand and Jeri Hogarth met with the Meachums as well as the Board at the Rand Enterprises Building in order to complete their case and take back what was still owed to Rand. Once they got started with the meeting Joy Meachum had explained that they had lowered the buyout offer from one hundred million dollars down to just twenty million dollars, and had included a restraining order, handing the paperwork over to Hogarth, as Hogarth noted that the restraining order was a nice touch.

Rand and Jeri Hogarth put their case forward
Hogarth then explained that they were demanding the controlling fifty-one percent of Rand Enterprises, as well as a seat on the board, his own staff as well as his own housing allowance of one million dollars per year which Ward Meachum merely scoffed at, noting that they could not even prove that this was the real Danny Rand and therefore had no evidence, noting that Rand was either crazy or at worst he was a con-man. Hogarth, however, proceeded to reveal a clay bowl as her proof, which confused Ward considerably until it was revealed it had been a gift from Rand had made for Joy as children, and that the bowl had still contained his fingerprints when he had made it.

Rand admits into fighting for his name
Now with undeniable proof about Rand's identity, there was nothing else to discuss as Rand and Hogarth had finally won their case. Enraged at having been outwitted by Hogarth, Ward had then furiously threatened to bury them with motions, delays, discoveries and depositions in order to delay Rand for at least ten years, however, Hogarth simply replied that they would see them in court. As they headed out, Ward criticized Rand's decision for not taking the one hundred million dollars, to which Rand had replied that it was his name he was fighting for and that meant something.

Rand watches Ward Meachum leaving
As Rand and Hogarth headed for the elevator, Rand saw the pictures of Wendell Rand and Harold Meachum which were hanging in the hallway. Looking at Harold's picture, he got curious about the coincidental meeting with Harold back in Birch Psychiatric Hospital and decided to find out if there was more to the situation than he thought. Rand saw Ward going into his office and was talking to someone on the phone, as Rand had then gone to quietly eavesdrop on Ward, he told Hogarth that he would be back soon before deciding to follow then Ward wherever he was now going.

Harold Meachum's Secret
Rand follows Ward Meachum into a building
Having eavesdropped on Ward Meachum while back inside the Rand Enterprises Building, Rand then followed Ward to a building where he was seemingly meeting the person who he had spoken to on the phone. Keeping out of sight of both Meachum and the security guard, Rand managed to make his way onto another elevator as he followed closely behind Meachum. Rand stayed out of sight but was then unable to continue following him into another room when one of the doors needed finger scanning.

Rand climbing into the building next floor
With little options left open to him, Rand then decided to continue following Ward as he then went out of a window and started climbing to the next floor, dangerously high above New York City. As he was about to enter through a window, Ward charged forward and pushed Rand away. As Rand fell, he barely managed to cling onto a light, barely holding on. He started utter a brief saying to the service to all beings of K'un-Lun before losing his grip, as he fell down and had lost conscious when he had hit his head hard and barely managing to avoid fatally falling back down to the ground floor far below him.

Rand is greeted by Ward inside the penthouse
When Rand woke up, he was inside the Penthouse as Ward greeted him and questioned why Rand had followed him. Rand noted that the last thing he remembered was climbing up the side of the building, as Ward compared this foolish action to Daredevil. As he had finally begun got his senses back, Rand then realized that Ward was the one who kicked him off the building and had tried to kill him, furiously confronting him although Ward had calmly noted that this was just what you had to do when you find somebody attempting to break in your home, which greatly annoyed Rand even more than before.

Rand discovering Harold Meachum is still alive
Rand squared up to Ward, noting that he was now testing his karma, however, before anything happened, Harold Meachum intervened, revealing himself to still be alive following his own death from cancer. Rand was stunned and shocked as he realized that Harold was alive and the visit back at Birch Psychiatric Hospital was real, as Harold had then convinced Rand that he had to do all this to protect Rand Enterprises. Delighted to see the closest thing to his family and father figure following his own family's deaths, Rand and Harold hugged as he happily reassured Rand that he was finally back home now.

Rand and Harold Meachum discuss his death
Harold explained about how he was still alive, telling Rand how after spending three years diagnosed with his cancer which had attacked his entire body, he was approached by some people who gave him a cure; however, he had needed to die first in order to then be cured, recalling his last breath before returning to life just three days later. When Rand then asked him about the people who cured him, Harold told him it was the Hand. Rand was horrified at hearing that the Hand were not only in New York City and that they had also managed to successfully infest Rand Enterprises while he had been gone.

Rand discusses K'un-Lun to Harold Meachum
Rand explained to Harold that he had never seen them and has only heard about them in fables back in K'un-Lun. Harold had pleaded for Rand to help him get rid of them all, while also asking about the Iron Fist, questioning if the Iron Fist was how he also escaped from the hospital which Rand confirmed. Harold explained how the Hand kept him locked up for years and asked Rand not to tell Joy Meachum for her own safety. As Rand had noted was stuck in court fighting for his place within Rand, he could not do much so Harold told Ward to stop all litigation against Rand and offer him everything he wanted.

Rand is warned to not trust Harold Meachum
Despite Ward expressing his displeasure at this instruction, Harold told him it was not up for negotiation before Harold informed Rand that the Hand recently made them enclose a deal to the Red Hook Pier for reasons that were not clear as of yet. Once that was said and done, Rand and Harold had then hugged once again, as Harold then expressed his delight at having a fighter back in the family before Rand and Ward had left for the elevator. Inside, Ward warned Rand not to trust Harold and that he was no replacement for Wendell Rand and that he only cared about himself as Ward walked away.

As per Harold Meachum's instructions to him, Ward Meachum had then ended their legal dispute and reinstated Rand as the CEO of Rand Enterprises with his controlling fifty one percent, also agreeing to all of Jeri Hogarth's demands that she had previously made. Later, Rand returned to the Rand Enterprises Building wearing his suit and ready for the announcement, meeting first with Ward and Joy Meachum, as Joy joked that he cleaned up pretty well.

Danny Rand officially announces his return
Rand stepped out before journalists once Ward had made a speech explaining how Rand would take Wendell Rand's place within their company before inviting Rand to make a speech which had been provided, although Rand remained nervous and awkwardly waved at Hogarth who he saw in the audience. Rand told the journalists about how it has been a long journey to get back home to Rand Enterprises as he noted that his father instilled him a respect for the company that has never faded. He talked about the Plane Crash that led to the deaths of his parents, explaining that he was rescued and raised by the Order of the Crane Mother who had protected him for years.

Rand answering the journalist's questions
He ended his speech by saying that his experience has taught him the value of life and hard work, that Rand matters. Journalists started asking questions as Jennifer Many from New York Bulletin asked Rand if reports were true that he was recently committed into Birch Psychiatric Hospital where he was treated by Paul Edmonds, which Rand confirmed, claiming that his return to New York City had been overwhelming and the Meachum had done what they could to help him through this stressful time. As more questions were being asked Ward took Rand away before he could begin to say too much.

Rand asks Joy Meachum about the pier
Once away from all of the journalists who were continuing to ask him questions, Joy noted that Rand's answer about being sent to the Psychiatric Hospital was much kinder than they deserved, to which Rand answered that kindness was the eternal law. While Ward went back into his office to continue his work, Rand asked Joy if she got time to go through the Red Hook Pier deal that she had previously made, remembering that Harold Meachum had informed him that this Pier was wanted by the Hand. When Joy asked why he was asking, Rand claimed that he just wanted to get bearings on the situation.

Rand talks to Megan about any appointments
Joy told Rand to talk to Megan to book time for a talk; however, Rand was informed that he could meet Joy in three days, much to his frustration before being told that he had his first appointment with Hogarth. They walked into Rand's new office that once used to be his father's office, as Hogarth noted that they had even found his father's original desk. Rand happily looked around the office and remembered the times he used to be there, even finding the stickers that he put under his father's old desk, much to Hogarth's frustration as she insisted that they should focus on completing the deal.

Rand signed his affirmed on his case
Hogarth then gave several documents for Rand to sign on, in order to affirm her law firm's partnership with Rand. As Rand signed all of the papers, he then asked what his job in the company actually was, as Hogarth explained that while he did not have a position, Rand now had the strongest voice in the board due to his own fifty-one percent share of the company. She further clarified that Rand had access to many places in the building due to his status. Before leaving, Hogarth advised Rand to ease up with his next few actions and that he had an extraordinary opportunity that should not be wasted.

Making Company Decisions
Rand stepping into his first board meeting
Later in the day, Rand joined the Rand Enterprises board meeting on how to sell the cure for leishmaniasis, as Rand arrived late into their meeting, inadvertently interrupting Ward Meachum's speech before then awkwardly insisted on being able to sit next to Joy Meachum for the duration of their meeting. While Ward was speaking, Joy explained this was a meeting to discuss the pricing for the medicine which Rand Enterprises was developing for the disease as Rand listened closely to the discussion on how much they should charge.

Rand suggested to set the pill price at cost
When the board suggested that they should raise the price for the medicine in order to fund new research and boost profits for the company, Rand questioned how many people died from the disease which they had the cure for. Upon hearing that around fifty million died a year, Rand then insisted that they should sell the medicine at lower prices to just what they cost to produce in order to make sure everyone can afford it, much to the horror of Lawrence Wilkins who attempted to reassure Rand that they as a company knew what they were doing and the medicine would be distributed to who needed it.

Rand argued the board about any bad profits
However, Rand also argued that no one should make a profit off the misery of others, once again insisting that they needed to sell the drug just at the cost that it took to produce it. As Ward confirmed his opinion, Rand then made his decision final with his position as the largest stakeholder of the company much to the annoyance and opposition from the board members, as Wilkins called the decision completely ridiculous. With the meeting concluded Joy told Rand that she had time to talk about the Red Hook Pier deal, claiming that her schedule had just cleared up due to the sudden change of plans.

Rand has a conversation with Joy Meachum
As they walked through New York City, Joy had asked about his life back in K'un-Lun and the Order of the Crane Mother, and teased him over wearing robes while he was there, requesting that he never turn up to the Rand Enterprises Building wearing a robe. As they walked, Rand questioned if Joy regretted giving Jeri Hogarth the bowl which had allowed Rand to regain his company and name, to which Joy said that while his decision was not morally wrong, there could have been a better way to convene his decision other than him forcing the decision by using his controlling interest within the company.

Rand reassured Joy Meachum's feelings
Rand further questioned why Joy gave the bowl to Hogarth to which Joy had then explained that Rand's return dredged up many feelings and memories about their family, noting how it made her recall the death of Harold Meachum, although Rand chose not to reveal that her father was in fact still alive, only saying how much her father had cared for her. Joy went on to say that his return had made her look on what she had become more deeply and she didn't like it and gave her a desire to do the right thing for a change. Rand reassured her that her father would have been proud of her.

Saving Joy Meachum
Rand talks about company deal with the pier
Back inside of Rand's new Penthouse, Rand had questioned exactly why Rand Enterprises would have ever bought the Red Hook Pier, to which Joy Meachum had just said that she did not know about the intention except that Ward Meachum had insisted for the purchase to be facilitated and she had done as he had wanted. Rand then asked why Joy had not questioned the deal, as Joy explained that Ward's leadership within Rand had led to success in the company and that there was no reason to question any of his choices.

Rand talks about his position as the Iron Fist
Joy asked why Rand wanted to know to which Rand explained with half-truth that back when he was in K'un-Lun, he worked hard to gain a powerful position of the Immortal Iron Fist in the monastery which everyone else, which included Davos had also wanted to obtain. He reminisced how the Order of the Crane Mother did not believe Rand could attain that position, calling him "xiaoguliao" or outsider. As Rand told that when he got the job, he realized that he never thought about why he wanted it, noting that he had not considered the cost on his actual life and he still did not know if it was worth the fight.
