Bakuto was a founding member and a leader of the Hand, who attempted to manipulate Danny Rand onto their side by capturing Madame Gao, one of the other key leaders of the organization.

Biography
Early Life
Forming the Hand
As a young man growing up in K'un-Lun, Bakuto's mother had told him all the stories of the Sack Man to keep him in line. Throughout his training in K'un-Lun, Bakuto became obsessed with the Immortal Iron Fist and learned how to use Chi for healing, while studying everything he could about the Iron Fist. However, Bakuto perverted the teachings of his masters with four others, including Alexandra Reid, Madame Gao, Sowande, and Murakami, to gain immortality and was banished from their home as a direct result. Together, they formed the Hand, using all the bones of Dragons they could find to maintain their long lives for centuries.

Iron Fist Obsession
While away from K'un-Lun, Bakuto was gifted with a film of an Iron Fist fighting against Chinese soldiers during World War II and as a result Bakuto continued his obsession and studied everything he could about the Iron Fist, while he founded the Hand Compound where he intended to recruit and train future soldiers for the Hand. Bakuto later met and recruited Colleen Wing into the Hand, gifting her with her own Dojo to train Hand soldiers. During his training of Wing, Bakuto would force her to eat Tarantulas to build an immunity to the venom before washing it down with the blood of a lamb.

Manipulating Iron Fist
Return to New York City
Bakuto is at last reunited with Colleen Wing
Having heard that Danny Rand had now seemingly returned from the dead having been lost in K'un-Lun for fifteen years, Bakuto returned to New York City in order to investigate himself, believing Rand to be the new Iron Fist whom they had sought to complete their plans. Bakuto went straight to Chikara Dojo where he watched as Colleen Wing trained by herself. Bakuto greeted his delighted former student, teasing her fighting form before commenting that the dojo had been taken over by Rand Enterprises while he had been gone.

Bakuto and Wing discussing Danny Rand
Sitting down to drink some tea together, Wing confirmed to Bakuto that Rand was the Iron Fist, noting that Rand fought not just with his body but with his mind which had inspired her, which led to Bakuto teasing her about their relationship. Wing made it clear that she was still loyal to him and the Hand before Bakuto warned her that the Iron Fist could put her in great danger, although Wing made it clear that she had already witnessed Rand's habit of getting into some danger. Bakuto then ordered her to continue as she was doing with Rand and promising that he would soon be back in touch with her.

Saving Colleen Wing
Bakuto arrives to come to Colleen Wing's aid
Having learned that Colleen Wing had been poisoned during a battle against another Hand faction, Bakuto then returned to Chikara Dojo to offer her help. Bakuto killed the guards surrounding the Dojo and met with Wing and Danny Rand outside the locked door, much to Wing's great delight as she had seen that her sensei had finally come to her aid. Although Rand was initially fearful that Bakuto's arrival may be another trap, Bakuto assured him that it was not and Rand reluctantly let him into the room as Wing had reassured him.

Bakuto teaches Iron Fist how to heal Wing
Kneeling down beside the quickly dying Wing, Bakuto then told Rand to heal her, although he clearly did not understand what this meant. Just as Claire Temple noted that Wing was now close to death from the poison, Bakuto realized Rand had not been taught the technique while at K'un-Lun so told him to seat with him. Bakuto then ordered Rand to center his Chi into his fist before opening his hand to burn the poison out of Wing's body. Rand did as Bakuto commanded and, despite causing them a lot of pain, he successfully saved Wing's life and destroyed the remaining poison before it could kill her.

Bakuto refuses to allow Claire Temple to come
Once it was clear that Wing was okay having been healed by the Iron Fist, Rand tried to stand only to faint from the power he had used. While the captured Madame Gao had mocked Rand's choice to trust Bakuto, he ignored her as Bakuto's men arrived in the building and took Wing, Rand and the captured Gao to the cars. As they prepared to leave New York City, Temple demanded that she come with them, however, Bakuto still insisted that she was not welcome before then driving off. Bakuto, however, was not aware that Davos had still been watching them closely and was now preparing to follow them.

Introducing the Hand
Bakuto welcoming Danny Rand and Wing
Back at the Hand Compound, Bakuto was training students when he was soon joined by Danny Rand and Colleen Wing who had both expressed their gratitude for all his help. As Bakuto had offered to help Rand recharge his Chi, Rand noted that not many people knew what the Iron Fist was, with Bakuto explaining it had always been an interest of his. Rand explained that his training had not been completed and therefore he did not know how to recharge his Chi.

Bakuto training alongside Danny Rand
Bakuto then invited Rand to stand beside him, noting how he had invented his own technique for recharging Chi based on his study of the Order of the Crane Mother. Together they performed various moves to help Rand meditate and rebuild his inner Chi. As they did the movements, Bakuto noted that Rand's body language betrayed an inner sadness and anger, telling him to realize all of those feelings to find the inner peace he needed. Once their exercises were done, Rand noted that he felt hungry, so Bakuto then asked Wing to tell the kitchen while he could continue to speak with Rand in private.

Bakuto has a conversation with Danny Rand
While they were speaking with each other, Rand noted that Wing had never mentioned her sensei before, so Bakuto explained that they tried to keep their secrets, noting that they took in damaged people to improve their lives, with Rand comparing it to a cult, while Bakuto jokingly noted it was a lot like the Girl Scouts, although Bakuto never mentioned they were really the Hand. As they walked throughout the facility, Rand asked what had become of Madame Gao, with Bakuto only saying that she had been taken out of commission, promising he would have her arrested by the police department soon enough.

Bakuto explains the Iron Fist's power to Rand
Going into his office, Rand asked Bakuto what his intentions were with his soldiers and the Iron Fist. Bakuto explained his belief that companies like Rand Enterprises were running the world, telling him that he could turn it around. Bakuto then showed Rand footage of a previous Iron Fist fighting some Chinese soldiers in the 1940s. Rand questioned why Bakuto was so interested in the Iron Fist, so Bakuto explained he had become obsessed ever since being given that film, promising to increase Rand's own power so they could then work together to protect the world from villainous people like Gao.

Bakuto being updated about Danny Rand
While working at his desk during the day, Bakuto was soon informed by his communications officer that Rand had just completed a phone call with Joy Meachum before the phone was handed over and Rand began speaking with Harold Meachum. Knowing the names, Bakuto ordered the man to leave the transcript on his desk. Bakuto was then joined by Wing who questioned how Rand had gotten on, as Bakuto noting that he thought Rand was ready. Bakuto noted that Wing's lies to Rand about their true purpose must have been hard for her while promising they would tell Rand the truth about the Hand soon.

Uncovered Secrets
Bakuto finding Danny Rand and Madame Gao
While walking through the Hand Compound, Bakuto inadvertently came across Danny Rand speaking with the captured Madame Gao from inside her cell, who was attempting to twist his perspective on Bakuto's intentions for him by hinting of Bakuto's role with the Hand. Bakuto claimed that Gao was just manipulating him again, explaining that he had tried to get the truth from her himself. Bakuto then allowed the clearly unnerved Rand to leave the building, locking eyes with Gao while on his way out.

Bakuto being introduced to Harold Meachum
Returning to New York City, Bakuto had then decided to personally meet with Harold Meachum in the wake of Gao's capture and the subsequent loss of her influence. Breaking into Harold Meachum's Penthouse, Bakuto greeted Meachum as he was about to have his dinner and invited him to seat with him. Bakuto informed Meachum that he was taking over from Gao, with Meachum expressing his own disappointment that he was not free of the Hand's control, as Bakuto promised him that the Hand's reach was still extensive so an escape was never really an option for Meachum under Gao's control.

Bakuto making his deal with Harold Meachum
Bakuto explained that while Gao had controlled him through fear, he intended to build a partnership with Meachum with a new purpose. Bakuto told that everything Gao had once owned and controlled was now his, and therefore he told Meachum to continue running Rand Enterprises through his son Ward Meachum as he had been, and if he did, then he would be granted a way to return to public life once again with the aid of Bakuto's faction of the Hand. As this had been his desire for the years since his death, Meachum had expressed his excitement at the proposition and agreed to work with Bakuto.

Fighting Iron Fist
Bakuto locating the enraged Danny Rand
Returning to the Hand Compound, Bakuto witnessed Danny Rand destroying all of their surveillance equipment which they had been using to spy on Rand Enterprises and Harold Meachum, confirming them to be the Hand. Bakuto expressed his disappointment that Rand had discovered the truth, claiming that he would have rather had Rand kill Madame Gao instead of doing this, before saying this was a test that Rand had failed.

Bakuto furiously fighting against Danny Rand
The furious Rand then attacked Bakuto, at first throwing a keyboard at him which Bakuto easily avoided. They then exchanged blows, with Bakuto using his speed to avoid the Iron Fist's attacks and using his rage against him. Bakuto then armed himself with two blades which he began swinging at the Iron Fist with great force, damaging some stone pillars in a furious swing. Before long however, the Iron Fist managed to disarm him and when Bakuto had attempted to do a flip, he knocked him down and made him crash hard on the ground, however Bakuto's soldiers were already coming to his aid.

Bakuto corners both the Iron Fist and Davos
Iron Fist was aided by Davos' arrival as the pair had attempted to get away, fighting off Bakuto's men. Having armed himself with a blade, Bakuto waited for Rand to be distracted by Darryl and stabbed him in the side before summoning his men to his side. Bakuto watched as Rand attempted to use the Iron Fist, only to tell him that his rage, confusion, and hatred had destroyed his Chi, making it now almost impossible for him to use the Iron Fist to defend himself. As Rand and Davos then stormed towards him, Bakuto sent in his men and fight against the warriors of K'un-Lun, thinking their numbers would eventually be enough to overpower and capture them both.

Bakuto comforting Darryl after their battle
During the fight, however, Colleen Wing betrayed Bakuto and opened the gate, allowing Iron Fist and Davos to escape from the compound before they could get captured by Bakuto's men. Despite his men's best efforts, Bakuto was still unable to stop the Order of the Crane Mother warriors from getting away, with Wing also climbing over the wall and escaping towards New York City. With the battle now over and his men struggling back onto their feet having been subdued by their enemies, Bakuto checked on Darryl personally. Bakuto had told Darryl he did not kill Rand, claiming it was not what he wanted.

Dealing with Colleen Wing
Bakuto personally confronting Colleen Wing
Bakuto returned to Chikara Dojo where he confronted Colleen Wing, demanding to know where she had gone. Wing accused Bakuto of attacking Danny Rand, although he insisted that they had merely defended themselves as Rand had just attacked them, claiming that his time at K'un-Lun had taught him to hate the Hand and he was blinded by the Order of the Crane Mother teachings. Bakuto tried to convince Wing that he only wanted Rand to trust them, but Wing insisted he wanted her to lie to Rand.

Bakuto giving Colleen Wing her new orders
As Wing began confronting Bakuto over his choices, Bakuto silenced her by ordering her to respect her sensei. Bakuto then defended the actions of the Hand by using the examples of Kevin Michener as well as Becca Yoo as people they had saved through their work with the Hand, claiming that after the Battle of New York they would have all been left to die. Bakuto claimed that they had saved them together by bringing them into the Hand, as Wing tired to insist she could still bring Rand back to their side. Bakuto had still refused to accept this, however, to order Wing to bring Rand to him when she found him.

Bakuto orders Colleen Wing's blood drained
When Wing did manage to finally locate Rand, however, she did not inform Bakuto and was handed over by Yoo. Having been brought to him, Bakuto confronted the captured Wing. Although Wing insisted that she still believed in the Hand, Bakuto simply told her that he no longer believed in her, noting how she had let her love for Rand affect her own commitment for the Hand, something which he could not forgive. The horrified Wing demanded to know what he had planned, but Bakuto only told her she would be Giving to the Hand in her very final moments, sending her to have all of her blood drained.

Deal with Ward Meachum
Bakuto makes a deal with Ward Meachum
Bakuto visited Ward Meachum who had been checked into the Birch Psychiatric Hospital due to his drug addiction, giving him a drug to counteract Madame Gao's poisonous heroin. Bakuto introduced himself as a member of the Hand, insisting he was no friend of Gao, claiming he was there to help. Bakuto promised to give Meachum the secret to killing his father whom he despised, noting that he had a power of resurrection that the Hand had now come to regret giving to Meachum's highly arrogant father.

Bakuto making his deal with Ward Meachum
As Meachum had then questioned what he wanted in return for all of his assistance, Bakuto made it clear that he wanted a similar level of control over Rand Enterprises as Gao had once had, promising that he would not run Rand the same way as Gao had, however, as he promised to hand over the cure to Gao's heroin so they could sell it to all their patients. Bakuto went on to make it clear that in exchange for the cure and his father's death, he wanted Meachum to help him capture Danny Rand, promising that he and Joy Meachum would be kept safe as a direct result of this favor to him and the Hand.

Tormenting the Meachums
Bakuto invades Harold Meachum's Penthouse
Having just learned that the Meachum's were taking advantage of Madame Gao's disappearance to steal all of his money, Bakuto betrayed Ward Meachum as he arrived early at Harold Meachum's Penthouse with his Hand soldiers and took them all hostage. As Ward had then attempted to confront Bakuto, he responded by striking Ward in the chest and having him men execute Harold's bodyguards, including Kevin Singleton and Gary before apologising for their deaths, while noting that nobody should threaten his life by pulling out their guns against him.

Bakuto taking the Meachums as his hostages
Bakuto had then calmly invited all of his hostages to sit down before demanding that Ward then stop the transfer of his money from Rand Enterprises, ignoring his request to allow his sister to walk away free. Bakuto then confronted Harold over his plan to steal his money away from him, while then explaining his new deal with Ward, noting how he had been given power over Rand Enterprises in exchange for just killing Harold, while also being allowed to capture Danny Rand. Ward then returned and informed Bakuto that the transfer had finally been stopped, however, Bakuto refused to allow him and Joy to leave.

Bakuto ignoring all of Ward Meachum's pleas
Having gotten all the Meachum family completely under his control, Bakuto then had Harold drugged out from his seat by his men and pushed onto his knees before him, and as Harold promised that he would soon come back from the dead and exact his revenge against him, Bakuto calmly explained that once they removed his head them his would never return to life. When Ward had desperately begged for his sister not to see this, Bakuto instead demanded his phone, which Ward immediately agreed to hand over to Bakuto.

Bakuto threatens to execute Harold Meachum
Bakuto then used the phone to call Rand, showing Rand the video of all of the Meachums now trapped under his control while Rand was still at Chikara Dojo with Colleen Wing. In his attempt to show Rand how serious he was about wanting to see him face to face, Bakuto then shot Joy through the gut, promising that she would survive if taken to Metro-General Hospital within thirty minutes. As another threat to Rand, Bakuto had then threatened to decapitate Harold if Rand did not come to him soon, before hanging up, leaving Rand with no choice but to come to his second family's rescue.

Capturing Iron Fist
Bakuto attempts to behead Harold Meachum
While they all waited, Bakuto gave the Meachum's blankets and pain killers for Joy's wounds, but still refused to take her to Metro-General Hospital, noting that Danny Rand was running out of time. With time up, Bakuto then drew his sword while he prepared to execute Harold Meachum, noting that the sword had cut down kings in the past. Bakuto offered Harold his last words, which he then used to mock Ward Meachum by calling him the biggest disappointment of his life and confess his love for Joy who he believed he should have trusted more, apologising and telling her that he had always loved her.

Bakuto successfully capturing the Iron Fist
Just before Bakuto's blade could drop, however, Rand arrived just in time and stopped him, with Bakuto noting how close he had left it. While Rand had noticed Kevin Singleton and Gary's bodies, he then allowed himself to be captured by the Hand. Bakuto accepted his surrender but not before ordering his men to handcuff Rand, noting that while Rand did not have the full power he was still a formidable enemy for them to face. As he prepared to leave, Bakuto apologized to Ward that he would not hold up his end of their agreement while had revealed his betrayal to Rand, much to Rand's disgust.

Bakuto explains his own plans for the Iron Fist
While heading downstairs, Rand questioned what Bakuto wanted with the Iron Fist, so Bakuto told him how his mother had told him the story of the Sack Man. Bakuto confirmed to Rand that he wanted the Iron Fist to be the Hand's personal sack man, noting that there was somebody within their organization who greatly wanted to work with him, promising that in exchange for his help he would rebalance his Chi and help him regain his Iron Fist and make him what he was meant to be, although Rand noted he did not even know what that was anymore, a comment which Bakuto had then smiled at.

Bakuto smirking at Danny Rand's escape
As they walked through the lobby of Harold Meachum's Penthouse, while preparing to make their return to the Hand and claim their victory, Rand had quietly managed to regain peace and used the Iron Fist to break free from of his handcuffs with a single powerful demonstration of power. However, while Bakuto and his men were taken off-guard by Rand's sudden freedom, the Iron Fist had then disappeared before he could strike Bakuto, leaving him defenseless while Bakuto smugly grinned at the seemingly defenseless Rand as Bakuto believed himself to currently be at the advantage.

Bakuto threatening to maim Danny Rand
However, he was joined by Colleen Wing and Davos who attacked Bakuto's men by killing two with Davos' blades, while Rand had personally engaged with Bakuto, striking him across the chin and causing his lip to bleed. Rand noted that he had come to believe that Bakuto was not actually allowed to kill him, but Bakuto promised to subdue him by whatever means necessary, even by cutting him and having the doctor patch him up, promising that the Hand had some of the best doctors in the world who could allow them to complete their plans regardless of the state that Rand was eventually left in.

Bakuto attempting to finally kill Danny Rand
Bakuto managed to slash Rand across the chest, causing only minor injuries before the pair engaged in their fierce battle, while Wing and Davos had continued fighting against Bakuto's men in order to give Rand the advantage in the battle. During their fight, Bakuto swung his sword furiously at Rand, who managed to catch it in the palm of his hands while Bakuto had furiously attempted to then finally kill him with it. Bakuto also attempted to use Rand's fear of his friends being in danger to his advantage, watching as Rand became distracted by Wing's pain as she was soon injured during their brief battle.

Bakuto is forced into making his quick escape
However, Bakuto was also briefly distracted by Wing's agony during the battle against his own soldiers, allowing Rand to break free and knock Bakuto backwards, gaining some advantage during their clash. Eventually, despite being seemingly strongly matched in their fighting skills, Rand managed to land some strong blows against Bakuto, putting him at the advantage. Before long, Rand and all his allies had defeated the Hand soldiers, which forced Bakuto to then desperately run away through the streets of New York City, knowing that he could not fight all three of the skilled warriors at once.

Duel at Bethesda Terrace
Bakuto mocking Colleen Wing's challenge
Bakuto was eventually chased to Central Park where he was cornered and challenged to duel by Colleen Wing who was determined to get her revenge against her former sensei. Bakuto mocked the challenge from Wing, claiming that only the warriors from the Order of the Crane Mother were worthy enough to fight him, while Wing was the traitor of the Hand and nothing more than a teacher of many young children at the Chikara Dojo which he gave to her.

Bakuto prepares to duel against Colleen Wing
Although Danny Rand had attempted to calm Wing and convince her not to fight such a dangerous enemy on her own, she vowed that she would be the one to kill her former sensei in their final duel to the death. Accepting the challenge, Bakuto raised his sword and pointed at Wing, before walking backwards and stepping out into the rain, with Bakuto still keeping the eyes trained onto Wing while she was preparing herself to make the first strike against Bakuto. Following a brief standoff, Wing then swung at Bakuto as their duel to the death began, while Rand was forced to watch from the sidelines.

Bakuto furiously fights against Colleen Wing
As he soon gained the advantage over his former student with some skilled counters and strikes from his many centuries of training and sword battles, Bakuto and Wing locked their swords together before Bakuto was able to take advantage and struck Wing in the stomach with the butt of his sword before kicking her away. As the battle had continued, Wing became more furiously determined to defeat her former sensei, angrily slashing at him while Bakuto was able to block the strikes and had then begun mockingly noting that while she had learned well, she was still only as strong as her own weapon.

Bakuto being overpowered by Colleen Wing
Countering Wing's next strike, Bakuto managed to twist around her arm before Bakuto then cut Wing's own katana in half with a single strong blow. However, the broken blade launched into the air and Wing then responded by kicking the broken blade into Bakuto's leg, noting that it was how she used her weapon that mattered. Bakuto attempted to regain dominance in the fight, furiously cutting Wing's arm, but as he moved to make another blow, she moved aside and plunged her sword into his stomach, much to Bakuto's great surprise and horror as blood began pouring out of his open wound.

Bakuto collapses to the floor from his wound
Clutching his bleeding stomach, Bakuto then fell down onto the floor as Wing prepared to execute Bakuto by raising her sword above her head. However, at the last moment, she stopped herself, noting she would not become a murderer like Bakuto, confessing that Bakuto had been right when he had told her that she was never cut out to be a member of the Hand. While Bakuto still lay bleeding on the ground and unable to move, Davos insisted they kill him, as Wing suggested they call the New York City Police Department and make Bakuto the first leader of the Hand to be arrested for all of his many crimes.

Bakuto being stabbed in the heart by Davos
Bakuto then mocked Rand, noting that his father had not raised him to become an assassin for K'un-Lun, claiming that if he did kill him then he would never be anything more than the Iron Fist, merely the living weapon who would be used and controlled by others for their own purposes, and would no longer be Danny Rand. While they all argued about what should be done, however, Davos finally stepped forward and furiously plunged his dagger directly into Bakuto's heart, finally killing him. However, while Rand and Davos argued about this action, Bakuto's body was then quietly taken by the Hand.

War for New York
Reunion with Colleen Wing
Bakuto reveals his survival to Colleen Wing
Having been informed by Alexandra Reid that they were now close to completing their plans, Bakuto was contacted and ordered to return to New York City to assist his allies. Upon his arrival, Bakuto had his men ambush the Iron Fist, while he revealed his return from death to the horrified Colleen Wing. Telling Wing that he had tried death when she and Davos killed him, but he had rejected it, Bakuto ordered his men to stand down, claiming that he and Wing were old friends, which Wing rejected before attacking her sensei.

Bakuto manages to wound Colleen Wing
Bakuto easily avoided Wing's attacks, telling her that he only wished to talk, but Wing refused to even listen, claiming that there was now nothing left to talk about. Bakuto explained that while the Hand had sent him to capture Danny Rand, he had personally come for her, even claiming that his past rejections of her had been a strategy to help her unlock her own potential to rejoin the Hand as another great warrior. Rejecting Bakuto's words, Wing attacked him again, vowing to never stop, resulting in Bakuto slashing her across the stomach with his dagger and watching her fall to the floor in agony.

Bakuto is reunited with the Iron Fist again
Before Bakuto could deliver the final blow and execute Wing, he was then attacked by Luke Cage who disarmed him and threw Bakuto across the alleyway. Cage was then joined by Rand and Claire Temple, who were both amazed by his return from the dead, while Bakuto claimed that he recalled their last battle and was looking forward to facing off against him again. Bakuto claimed that it was wise that Rand had joined the Defenders, promising that the Hand would show him his true destiny was more than he was taught at K'un-Lun, before Bakuto then escaped into the shadows.

The Hand Reunites
Bakuto discusses K'un-Lun with Madame Gao
Returning to their headquarters, Bakuto asked Madame Gao if they were no longer on speaking terms since he had captured her during their last encounter. However, Gao insisted that as long as they were still part of the Hand, they would be on the same side. Gao asked Bakuto if he remembered K'un-Lun before noting that the only way they would be able to return would be if they captured the Iron Fist, with Bakuto noting that was why he had come back. Bakuto was questioned why he went after his former pupil Colleen Wing instead of targeting the Iron Fist himself.

Bakuto is told to be quiet with Alexandra Reid
Bakuto claimed Wing could lead them to Iron Fist but Gao claimed that Bakuto had always had a weakness for his own students, to which he argued that he simply did not need to blind his underlings like Gao did to make them loyal to him. They were then joined by Alexandra Reid who promised to confront Bakuto over his failures soon enough, but first Murakami informed the group that the Iron Fist had a new ally in his fight, claiming that Daredevil had joined his side as he had just encountered recently him, and although Gao had still questioned his claims, Murakami insisted that it was the truth.

Bakuto discusses the return of the Daredevil
Although Bakuto questioned why this was a concern as they were all as skilled warriors as Daredevil was, Murakami noted that Daredevil had fought against Nobu Yoshioka alongside Elektra just before her death and rebirth. While Bakuto listened, Murakami claimed that Elektra had loved Daredevil which was why she had attacked him during the Ambush at the Royal Dragon and even claimed that it was not the Black Sky who had failed them, but Reid for using up all of their Resurrection Elixir to bring back a warrior who was now a threat to the Hand's very existence if she was to betray them.

Bakuto questions Alexandra Reid's leadership
Bakuto agreed with what Murakami said, noting that the five leaders of the Hand were always stronger together, with Gao noting that they had lost Sowande which meant they were now already weaker and therefore at an even greater risk. Although Reid had still insisted that Sowande would return to them eventually, Bakuto noted that she could not know this, pointing out that without their Elixir, death was now a possibility for them for the first time. The other leaders all then began to question Reid's leadership, as Bakuto pointed out that even she was still expendable to the Hand's greatest mission.

Losing Sowande
Bakuto is informed of Sowande's demise
Much to his considerable horror, Bakuto and the other Hand leaders were presented with the severed head of Sowande, which had been found in one of his warehouses after he had presumably been killed by Stick. While Madame Gao then claimed that Sowande's death could have been avoided, Bakuto noted that they did not even try to find him, all while Reid insisted that he had gotten himself captured and showed almost no remorse for Sowande's death, even suggesting that they stop pretending that they would be mourning his loss, much to Bakuto's shock at such a heartless suggestion.

Bakuto questioning Alexandra Reid's choices
Reid pointed out that all their many years together had rarely been peaceful and they had all survived several assassination attempts from one another. When Reid suggested they show unity during this time, Murakami had noted that they had been unified until Reid had brought the Black Sky into their organization. As Bakuto demanded to know where Elektra was, Reid insulted him before she claimed that she was being kept hidden under the belief that they would try to destroy her, or she may kill them. Gao stood up for Reid, claiming that they must honor Sowande by continuing their mission.

Elektra's Betrayal

Bakuto was informed that a meeting of the Hand's leaders was now happening in the board room and discovered that Danny Rand had finally been captured and was presented to them all. Bakuto watched as Rand was spoken to by Alexandra Reid who explained the Hand's goal was simply to finally return to K'un-Lun, even claiming that they were not so different compared with Rand himself, which he furiously denied before Bakuto watched on while Rand was being taken away by several more of Reid's own personal soldiers.

Bakuto discussing the Defenders' actions
While Reid addressed the others, Murakami still expressed his own great disappointment at Reid's leadership, claiming that little had gone to plan under her leadership. Although Madame Gao defended Reid by noting that they finally had the Iron Fist, Murakami claimed that it was still not worth the risk to their own lives in the wake of Sowande's death. Bakuto then spoke up and noted their sole focus from this point onwards must be to finally reclaim the Resurrection Elixir as soon as possible while Gao noted that the Defenders would likely come for Rand and must not be underestimated.

Bakuto witnesses Elektra kill Alexandra Reid
Bakuto then witnessed Reid furiously demanding that they do not underestimate her before ordering Elektra to hunt down and kill Luke Cage and Jessica Jones, along with Daredevil. Bakuto listened as Reid reminded them of all they had achieved under her leadership, noting that she was the one to wipe out the Chaste and captured the Iron Fist. However, just as Reid was continuing her speech, Elektra had returned into the room and plunged her Twin Sai through Reid's back. Bakuto watched on in utter horror as Elektra claimed to be the leader of the Hand before slicing off Reid's head, killing her.

Bakuto watches as Elektra takes up power
Having watched Reid's corpse being taken away, Bakuto told Elektra that this was not how they did business, to which Elektra informed him that this had now changed. When Bakuto and Murakami vowed to do what needed to be done to protect the Hand, threatening to destroy Elektra, she noted that this was the first challenge they had a face without the Elixir to bring them back from death. Bakuto then watched as Gao argued that Reid's death must be explained to their partners, but Elektra showed little interest in this, calling them living underground in hiding the complete opposite of having power.

Bakuto stands up against Elektra's leadership
Bakuto then noted that Elektra knew nothing of power, claiming that since her death of Nobu Yoshioka's hands she did not even exist until Reid had given her back her self. Bakuto noted that the Hand had existed for as long as it had because they remained careful of maintaining themselves and their lives. Elektra, however, told Bakuto that she did not care anything for the Hand, and instead claimed she only cared about gaining the Dragon bones hidden underneath New York City so that she and the others could live forever, promising that nothing, not even death, would be able to stand in her way.

Bakuto discusses how to destroy Elektra
Bakuto and the others watched on the monitors as Elektra took the captured Rand underneath Midland Circle in the pit the Hand had been digging. Murakami expressed his deep distrust for Elektra, claiming they should destroy her before she laid waste to everything they had been building. Gao noted that they were closer than they had been before, with the Iron Fist being led towards the doorway from K'un-Lun, claiming Elektra not being one of them did not matter, as she had the power to bring them a new beginning, while Bakuto hinted a desire to kill her once they had what they needed.

Showdown with the Defenders
Bakuto preparing to challenge the Defenders
Bakuto and his surviving allies had then stood as the defense while the Defenders soon arrived inside Midland Circle with the intention of saving Danny Rand from the Hand and their utterly diabolic schemes. As Jessica Jones insisted that they would not leave without Rand, Bakuto claimed his meant they would never leave, leading to a standoff as both teams prepared all of their own weapons for their battle, with Bakuto confidently drawing his sword ready for the fight against the heroes, determined not to allow them to interfere with their current plans.

Bakuto and Murakami fight against Daredevil
As the battle began, Bakuto and Murakami then joined forces and together they attacked Daredevil, who was used his own Billy Club to block and counter their moves. Despite being two of the Hand's greatest warriors, both Bakuto and Murakami both struggled to fight of Daredevil, who used both his strong strikes and remarkable speed to avoid their deadly strikes and kept knocking them back, all while Madame Gao fought against the other two Defenders alone. Bakuto briefly managed to gain the upper hand against Daredevil, forcing him back against concrete blocks and sheets of glass.

Bakuto furiously tries to destroy the Daredevil
Daredevil still however managed to regain control as he threw Bakuto away from him, smashing him into yet another sheet of glass before they continued the fight, managing to knock Murakami away as he then engaged in a fight against Luke Cage, leaving Bakuto to fight Daredevil alone. Becoming enraged that he could not kill the Devil of Hell's Kitchen as easily as he would like, Bakuto's strikes become stronger, smashing his blade into the concrete blocks and destroying them, all while Daredevil continued avoiding every strike until Colleen Wing appeared and managed to block Bakuto's strike.

Bakuto is forced to make his sudden retreat
Bakuto then fought against both Daredevil and Wing singlehandedly, finding himself now suddenly at a grave disadvantage against the legendary vigilante and his own former student, who both managed to land painful strikes against Bakuto in quick succession. Seeing that they were quickly losing this battle, Murakami called out to Bakuto before cutting into a gas pipe, which Bakuto then ignited by grinding his sword over the ground and causing sparks to hit the gas. As the flames separated the Hand leaders from the Defenders, they then made their hasty retreat from the losing fight.

Final Showdown
Bakuto again faces off against Colleen Wing
Bakuto followed Colleen Wing into an empty boiler room where he began calmly searching for her, with his sword drawn and ready for a clash. Noticing a bag containing John Raymond's bombs, Bakuto called out to Wing who eventually showed herself with her own sword drawn. Bakuto smiled upon seeing his former student again, telling her that their fates were clearly aligned, while Wing claimed that this was not fate but design, as she had come to end their fight and finally kill Bakuto for everything he had done to her.

Bakuto recommends Wing simply surrender
Hearing someone's phone ring in the room, Bakuto accused Wing of being a follower of the Defenders, claiming he had trained her to become a leader. Unwilling to hear anymore, Wing then attacked Bakuto as the two began clashing swords, with Wing still determined to land a killing blow against her former sensei. The pair continued fighting around the boiler room, as Bakuto mockingly told Wing to not even bother wearing herself out with a pointless fight, claiming that due to training her he knew all of her limits which he proved by landing a hard kick on Wing's stomach, knocking her back.

Bakuto gains the upper hand on Colleen Wing
Bakuto claimed there was no damage Wing could do to him that could not be undone, now that Iron Fist had finally assisted that to reclaim the Resurrection Elixir, which would allow Bakuto to live forever with his fellow leaders of the Hand. Bakuto offered Wing a final chance to join him, but Wing refused, claiming that she no longer needed him before attacking. During their fight, Bakuto attempted to plunge his dagger into Wing's neck, only to miss and get it stuck in a pipe, where Wing took it and assisted Claire Temple by throwing the dagger at the man she was currently fighting against.

Bakuto being challenged by Misty Knight
Taking advantage of Wing's momentary distraction, Bakuto managed to slash her across the back. While Wing remained on her feet, she and Temple were assisted by Misty Knight who had arrived on the scene. Upon seeing Bakuto cleaning his blade of Wing's blood, Knight ordered him to drop his sword, and when he refused, Knight fired several shots into Bakuto's chest. Due to the power of the Elixir, Bakuto was able to brush off the gunshots before he managed to subdue Knight while she was reloading before returning to his duel with Wing, claiming that she was always a disappointment.

Bakuto manages to cut off Misty Knight's arm
Seeking to emotionally throw Wing off balance, Bakuto reminded her of how as a child, she had only desired to belong to something, which he had provided to her with the Hand Compound before he had given her the Chikara Dojo. Bakuto claimed that this desire within her was the reason why he had saved and raised her when she was young, claiming that he once had the same desire. Bakuto then subdued Wing before holding Temple's throat between his swords, promising to take away her new family. Knight then charged in to aid Temple, resulting in Bakuto slicing off Knight's right arm.

Bakuto is finally beheaded by Colleen Wing
While Knight then fell to the floor in agony, blood pouring out of her wound, Wing had charged forward and attacked Bakuto. Unwilling to allow anyone else to get hurt by him, Wing had managed to steal her own sword back from Bakuto before cutting his throat with it. While Bakuto stood in horror at his student gaining the upper hand against him, Wing took her moment to end their fight, managing to slice off Bakuto's head with a single swing with her sword. Bakuto's corpse then fell to the ground where it had remained until the bombs planted inside Midland Circle had exploded, destroying Bakuto's body.

Personality
Bakuto originally appeared to be a gentle and righteous man aiming for overall prosperity. This was shown as his faction of the Hand gave troubled people training and purpose in life, allowing them a chance for a scholarship and to make more of their life. Unlike other Fingers of the Hand, Bakuto does not use violence as a primary solution to problems, describing himself as more outgoing than his associates. However, he still has no qualms about killing innocents who stand in his way. Despite having committed heartless crimes in the past for the Hand, he isn't entirely heartless, as when Sowande was killed, Bakuto had shown sympathy and mourned for him, as he was a close ally and a friend.

As he said himself he tried to create a partnership with others in order to achieve mutual benefit. However, behind this behavior, he was shown to be ruthless in order to achieve his goals. He became bound on making the Iron Fist working for him. To achieve this he extorted and threatened people. When Colleen Wing turned against him he wanted her killed, displaying a lack of tolerance towards traitors. However, he repeatedly gave her chances to rejoin the Hand and be forgiven.

He seemed strongly against corporations that ran society and abused their power. This showed a bit of a contradiction as he himself demanded complete obedience from others as well.
