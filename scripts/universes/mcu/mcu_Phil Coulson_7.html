<html><p>Coulson and May approached Fitz and asked if Simmons had cleared him after getting banged up when the monoliths exploded. Fitz said he was fine but felt foolish that he hadn't realized the beacon was programmed to overheat and explode. Coulson told him not to blame himself; Hale had declared war on S.H.I.E.L.D. Fitz said Hale had done something worse than that. He showed them video from a D.W.A.R.F. he had sent to analyze the damage in the basement. The elevator carrying the D.W.A.R.F. opened on level 27, revealing an immense forest inside the Lighthouse. Coulson said he would have thought it impossible, but after being transported to the year 2091, his threshold for preposterous was way out of whack.

Fitz then replayed the only transmission received from a D.W.A.R.F. in the basement level. It showed a mysterious glowing crack in the wall. He speculated that when the three Monoliths exploded, they blew a hole in space-time and that the crack was another dimension bleeding back into their world. Coulson said the good news was that Daisy was probably not responsible for destroying the Earth. Fitz replied that the bad news was that the end of the world may have already begun. 

After Deke Shaw and Johnson were attacked by a Kree Warrior while retrieving supplies, Fitz hypothesized it was their fears come to life. He showed Coulson, May, Shaw and Johnson another video transmission from a D.W.A.R.F. in the basement level in which Lash's face could be seen. Fitz stated his belief that when the Monoliths exploded, they tore open a Fear Dimension and that the alien energy emanating from the crack in the basement wall was reaching inside their minds and making physical manifestations of their deepest fears. The Kree Warrior was Johnson's fear; Lash was May's; and it turned out that the forest on level 27 was Shaw's fear. 

Fitz said he had sealed off the lower two-thirds of the Lighthouse where the majority of the phenomena had occurred, but that it was already spreading. He believed that if they used the Gravitonium from Shaw's Gravity Puck, they could create a perpetual force to stitch together the tear in space-time. Someone would have go to the tear in the basement and activate the device, and that person might get sucked into another dimension or killed by a fear manifestation. Coulson said it was a risk he would have to take, and walked off.

Johnson, May and Fitz followed Coulson, arguing that he shouldn't be the one to risk his life. Both May and Johnson volunteered to go instead, but Coulson overruled them, saying he was going alone, end of discussion. Johnson reminded him that basic military tactics dictate that one should never jeopardize a general when a soldier can do the job. Coulson countered, saying he was looking at the big picture. Johnson was needed to lead and inspire S.H.I.E.L.D. Johnson said there was no S.H.I.E.L.D. anymore. Coulson started to argue that S.H.I.E.L.D. was a symbol that must continue no matter what. In the middle of his argument he collapsed.

After Coulson was revived, he sent Shaw out of the Lighthouse with a to-do list, telling him to be careful and avoid getting arrested again. He then joined Alphonso Mackenzie, Johnson, May and Fitz in the control room. Simmons walked in and stated that the MRI showed necrotic tissue branching out from the lethal wound Coulson had sustained in his heart and left lung when he was killed by Loki. She said the tissue appeared to have been dead for several years, there was no cure and the condition was progressing rapidly.

May correctly guessed that Coulson was dying as a result of the deal he struck with Ghost Rider in order to defeat Aida. Coulson confessed that whatever alien voodoo had been holding him together, Ghost Rider burned through it. That was the price he agreed to pay for help from the Spirit of Vengeance. Johnson was angry that Coulson had hidden his condition form them. Coulson told her he hadn't wanted them distracted with looking for a solution for his condition when they had bigger problems. Johnson said they had a solution, that Tess was brought back from the dead in the 2091 timeline. Coulson admitted he just didn't want to go through being resurrected again. Johnson stormed off in tears.

Coulson caught up with Johnson. She told him she couldn't lead S.H.I.E.L.D. without him. Coulson told her to believe in herself, that she was capable of more than she imagined. She said there was no S.H.I.E.L.D. without him. Coulson hugged her consolingly.

Meanwhile, a fear manifestation in the shape of Simmons tried to kill Yo-Yo Rodriguez in the infirmary. The rift between dimensions was expanding and they couldn't wait any longer to seal it.

May found Coulson sitting alone in a corridor. She asked him if the knowledge that he was dying was the reason he had stepped back from pursuing a romantic relationship with her. Coulson said he didn't want her to waste her time on another lost cause. May said that was her decision and she accused him of just giving up on his life. Coulson stated he had come to terms with his impending death, having already had  his second chance at life and he didn't want to be greedy. It was time to make space for somebody else to lead the team, meaning Johnson. May said that none of the team was ready to give up on him. Coulson replied that he had every intention of walking back out of the basement; just because he had made peace with dying didn't mean he was in a hurry. 

Closure of the Rift
Leo Fitz equipped Coulson with a .50 caliber handgun, a helmet with a gas mask and a camera and microphone, and the Gravity Containment Device he had fashioned from Deke Shaw's Gravity Puck. Fitz warned Coulson that he might run into manifestations of his own fears and the fears of all his team members while in the basement. He also warned Coulson not to get close to the dimensional rift when he activated the device, or he could get crushed by its gravity field or sucked into the Fear Dimension.

Before getting into the elevator, Coulson made Fitz promise to do the thing they had discussed, regardless of whether Coulson survived the basement. He was cryptically referring to Fitz proposing to Jemma Simmons. Fitz was reluctant to commit, but Coulson asserted that symbols and institutions were important; they gave people something to believe in.

In the elevator, Coulson donned the helmet and confirmed visual and audio contact with his team in the control room. He jokingly asked what the odds were that he would find a giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man in the basement. Melinda May told him to shoot first and ask questions later. When the elevator stopped and the doors opened, Coulson drew his gun and stepped out. The video and audio in his helmet immediately stopped working and he was cutoff from his team.

As Coulson started looking for the rift, he encountered a fear manifestation in the form of Mike Peterson. Peterson greeted Coulson and said there was nothing to be afraid of. He said he was unarmed and that the air was fine. Coulson checked the air quality sensor on his belt, then took off his helmet. Peterson then said he was a figment of Coulson's imagination and that he was there to help Coulson face the facts. He told Coulson that he was still lying on the operating table, dying, after being stabbed in the heart by Loki. He said Coulson had never been to Tahiti, Malta, Puerto Rico, outer space, the Framework or the future. Coulson put his gun away and took out the gravity device. He told himself to get back to work and ignore what the fear manifestation was saying.

Peterson then asked which made more sense: being brought back to life after being dead for days; having false memories implanted; living in a world with alternate realities and rocks that tear holes in space-time; or that his brain was being stimulated with electricity to revive it and his subconscious was trying to make sense of what he was experiencing. Peterson then said that Coulson's life since being stabbed by Loki had been just a dream. He said Coulson never had a flaming skull; it was a dream triggered by the pain of electrodes on his scalp. He said Coulson was never a history teacher in an alternate reality; he was just remembering his father.

Coulson told him to stop. He said that Peterson was just a manifestation of his fear of dying. Coulson said he thought he had come to terms with death, but he was finding it hard to let go. Peterson told him that was why his mind had created a story where he spent years doing all the things he never got a chance to do, like vacationing in Tahiti, traveling to the stars, owning his own plane and a car that could fly, having his own S.H.I.E.L.D. team that became his family, and becoming a hero. Coulson said Peterson didn't know what the members of his team meant to him and told him not to say they were nothing. Peterson replied that they were a reflection of Coulson, that he was one of the good guys.

Peterson then commented that Coulson was still holding the gravity device. He pointed to the light emanating from the rift and told Coulson he was ready to walk into the light, and suggested they go together. They started walking toward the rift, then Coulson stopped abruptly and told Peterson he was not buying it.

Peterson grabbed Coulson by the lapels, causing him to drop the gravity device, and threatened to drag him into the rift himself. Suddenly the manifestation of Peterson was shot by the real Deathlok and vanished. Deathlok approached Coulson, who had fallen to the ground, and told him to pick up the device. However, before he could activate it, a manifestation of Lash appeared. Deathlok punched him and he disappeared. Vrellnexians started crawling out of the rift. Coulson and Deathlok fought them until they had killed them all.

Coulson activated the Gravity Containment Device and it created a powerful gravity field that pulled Coulson and Deathlok toward the rift. As they were struggling against the gravity field, a manifestation of Hive appeared. Coulson punched him and Deathlok finished him off with his Forearm Rocket Launcher.

The gravity device finally closed the rift, causing Coulson to fall to the floor on top of Deathlok. When they sat up, Coulson was sitting between Deathlok's legs. He asked if Deathlok was real. Deathlok jokingly asked if that would make their situation any less awkward.

FitzSimmons' Wedding
Following the completion of the mission, Coulson joined Leo Fitz and Deke Shaw for the wedding of the former and Fitz himself replied that the gravitational field contains the crack, but with a pinch of Gravitonium it would not last long the container and that a much more effective solution is needed but the important thing is that the anomalies would immediately disappear and he also said that they had to thank many people and Shaw said in a joking tone not to overdo it and also said that the situation was very precarious at the beginning, but he had told all the agents, that Coulson himself had asked him to track down, Daisy Johnson's story and that he had managed to buy the items on the list as if he were shopping and, despite so much effort, managed to get some beers for the wedding.

Shaw eventually confessed to Coulson and Fitz that he was very upset when he keyed in the codes on his phone that had taken him to the middle of a meadow, thinking about why the Quinjet did not arrive at the speed of light and also said that he had succeeded. to avoid the insects, putting his own pants inside his shoes, so they would not sneak into his legs and tickle him, much to Coulson and Fitz's perplexity and the latter said that they should not only thank Shaw, but also Deathlok and that he was talking about him.

Fitz then asked Coulson if Peterson would stay with them, but Coulson said he wouldn't stay, as he works alone, but that he has shaken hands with S.H.I.E.L.D. and to find a doctor for Officer James Davis, but who would be leaving after the festivities tonight, to which Fitz said it was fortunate that he had arrived in perfect timing, to which Coulson agreed.

Fitz took the opportunity to ask what Coulson was facing down there, but the latter asked Fitz if he was trying to buy time, as the elevator had been standing still for a minute and adjusted Fitz's dress to make it presentable, before accompanying this last at the altar by Jemma Simmons.

Having heard the initial Fitz-Simmons exchanges, Coulson walked past the two of them and began to make a speech, in which he said they were all gathered at a time everyone expected, and said that important members of the team had come in mind the marriage already before the Fitz-Simmons themselves and that it would have been playing with fire, marrying the two of them by passing every second of every day and asked who was in favor of marriage, to which everyone said yes and Coulson then asked Fitz-Simmons to exchange the promise of marriage, listening to the speech that Simmons had written for Fitz, to which all of them cried tears of joy, after hearing him and Coulson told Fitz to give his promise to Simmons, encouraging him to make the promise with the words he thought of saying to Simmons, which he himself did.

Once Fitz had said what he thought of Simmons, Coulson told him and her to take the rings quickly and exchange the promise of marriage, with the help of Coulson's own words and the latter said that he declared them husband and wife, with the powers that were given to him by the two newlyweds and said that the groom can kiss the bride, to whom everyone applauded.

Gravitonium and Murray Jacobson's research
Following the conclusion of Fitz-Simmons' marriage, Coulson went to see how Rodriguez is and Mackenzie said she was nervous and Simmons asked Coulson himself how she is, to which the latter said that he felt like when Simmons saw that he did not was fine and Coulson begged the latter to stop asking, then informing Rodriguez that Fitz was building the best prosthetics in the world, which will unfortunately take some time, as the materials are too few and asked Rodriguez to rest and heal, to which the latter said that, having always been on the move, she is not used to waiting and Coulson ordered her to try to be patient, showing her his prosthetic hand, telling her that no one notices that it is fake and that it was very fun. Rodriguez guessed, even before Coulson could finish, that Fitz always adds the same sensations, but Coulson reluctantly said that he himself feels nothing, but that he is used to it in the end.

Rodriguez asked Mackenzie if he felt like dating a Cyborg and the latter told her that it wasn't the parts that mattered, but the people, much to Simmons' amazement, but Mackenzie himself said that the only thing he really hates about robot is that they have neither heart nor soul, which humans have. Rodriguez then told Mackenzie that he authorizes him to make her nervous again, but Simmons asked her to "pass the ball", about getting nervous, as she wanted to interrupt the party to rest Rodriguez herself and she asked for a beer, to which Mackenzie told, before she leaves with Coulson what she can do, provided she abides by Simmons' advice.

Mackenzie told Coulson then that they had to go on a mission to find the pieces that Fitz needed and the latter passed them just in time to inform them that the Gravitonium of Shaw's buckle was not powerful enough to close the crack, describing it as close the dam with scotch tape. Coulson then asked Fitz how soon he will begin to reopen and the latter said that, given the increase in electromagnetic waves, he said they had cash days, later apologizing to Coulson for his insensitivity to him.

The latter said, then, that despite their fate of dying everyone, they must at least prevent everyone from dying at once and Mackenzie said it took more Gravitonium to close the crack forever, to which FItz said he saw it difficult, as they hadn't seen him for almost 6 years, which is why he said they all had to look for him.

Mackenzie reminded the other two that Rodriguez is no help unless they help her and that they shouldn't forget her and Coulson said Johnson hopes to kill two birds with one stone and, when they reached the latter at the command center, Johnson herself said that Cybertek had Gravitonium in their lab and that it was the same company that had made Deathlok's Prosthetic Leg, but May reluctantly said that Ian Quinn is missing and Raina died at the hands of Jiaying and they concluded that the Gravitonium had vanished into thin air.

Johnson said they had managed to find the scientists who worked for Quinn, to which they told Shaw, when he came in and asked who it was that he was a rich and very evil one. Coulson revealed that Shaw was invited by himself, since in his time he had seen far more Gravitonium than they thought and Shaw could help them narrow down the search a lot.

Johnson went on to explain, then, that the doctor who studied Gravitonium was Dr. Joseph Getty and Coulson confirmed that he was dead, as they searched for him and Johnson said that all the death certificates of the Cybertek scientists of those who died in the recent years have been signed by a man, Murray Jacobson.

Fitz sensed, therefore, that they must still be alive and that their death could be a cover to escape justice, even though Johnson, despite agreeing with Fitz, had not found anything on the Internet and, starting the facial recognition, he found numerous identities, including the most recent one that is called Lewis Casalino and that he was a real estate agent in Bathon Rouge and Coulson replied that they had to talk to this guy, despite Shaw said they were still looking for them and that they spared no expense to catch them.

Coulson thus proposed to go at night, taking advantage of the darkness to not be noticed and that if they manage to convince him to find Getty, they will have found the Gravitonium and Johnson offered to accompany him, since the Inhuman Control Device is preventing her from using their own. powers, although Coulson said he wanted to go alone and Johnson said it was the simple fact that he wanted to get some air and Shaw offered to accompany her, but Coulson forced him to stay with Fitz, despite his protests and this last and Shaw argued about their wits and Johnson asked Shaw to be smart by staying in the Lighthouse.

After finding Casalino, Coulson and Johnson asked him to join them and ask him questions, but he ran away, forcing Mackenzie and May to intervene, barring his way and forcing him to put the gun away, despite Casalino being impassive, but he put it down. just as Mackenzie revealed herself to him, calling Casalino "The Candy Man", revealing to the team that the two of them had known each other for a long time and Casalino called Mackenzie "Mack Hammer", exchanging a friendly hug, much to the amazement of the team.

Mackenzie told the team that his real name is Anthony Caine and that he was his roommate at S.H.I.E.L.D. academy, to which Coulson asked why he called him "The Candy Man" and Mackenzie told him that he called him that because he was one. who gave people everything, forcing the academy to expel him, since he never came to class and was not a student, unlike Mackenzie, who was the opposite of him and Caine said they were called respectively "the holy and corrupt ".

Johnson then asked Caine why Mackenzie was called "Mack Hammer" and he replied that this name came from the fact that he was hooked in high school with MC Hammer. Johnson then began looking for Mackenzie's photo as a young man, who all laughed at when they saw it and the latter asked his team not to let this information out of the Zephyr One.

Caine then asked the real reason he was summoned, aside from reliving fond memories with Mackenzie and Coulson replied that the reason they sought him was because they were looking for a Cybertek scientist: Joseph Getty and Johnson reminded him of Caine, when he asked why he should know him, that he had signed his death certificate. Coulson said that this scientist, given his survival, could help him with important information and prevent the Earth from exploding into billions of pieces.

At that point, Caine asked the team if they were aware of the operation paperclip, to which Coulson said they knew what it was, and Caine began to tell that the same thing had happened with the HYDRA and that it provided new lives and identities. thus giving second chances to those who deserved to have them, thus erasing their past. Mackenzie then asked Caine to speak to the man if he knows where he is and the latter asked if he was willing to break the rules, to which he replied yes, as the situation was apocalyptic and the rules do not apply they can follow more.

Coulson said that Cybertek had built the scientists by force, but he didn't like that their criminal records had been cleaned and that they roam the world freely as if nothing had happened and Johnson said that one of them could be the solution to save him, but Coulson remained firm on his decision not to be saved and become a new John Garrett, who had gone insane from the effects of GH.325, but Johnson insisted that Coulson himself must be saved and that Cybertek was tasked with keeping Garrett alive and that he could do the same with him, but Coulson himself, losing his patience, firmly ordered not to be saved, since he had already had an unnatural extension of life and did not want a second and left the control room, although Johnson and May did not give up on their decision to save him and decided to act in secret against Coulson's will.

Principia's Research
Following Getty's indications of the place where the Gravitonium was last, that is on a ship in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, Fitz, after receiving information from Coulson, said that they tried to search for the ship in an area they had already searched, but there was nothing and tried to extend the search to 100 miles in each direction from the coordinates to which he had communicated, but the nautical charts showed nothing and the sonar showed no deviations, concluding that perhaps, had been hijacked by pirates.

Coulson said that Getty had confessed that the ship had sunk and Simmons asked if he had considered if he could lie, as he was from HYDRA, but Coulson said he believed him and asked Fitz-Simmons and Shaw to keep looking for the ship.

After a few hours, Coulson learned from Fitz-Simmons, thanks to Shaw's intuition, that the ship was not under water, but in the sky, since the Gravitonium had been struck by lightning, creating a gravitational field around the merchant ship dragging it into the sky and being carried by wind and air currents and asked to search in the clouds, to which May asked Davis if there was any news and the latter said it was like looking for a needle in a haystack, however, before losing hope, they managed to successfully find the merchant ship, much to Johnson and Caine's astonishment that it flew and the latter asked if they often saw them that way, to which everyone, including Coulson, they said yes.

Infiltration of the Ship
Using the Containment Module, Coulson, Mackenzie and Johnson infiltrated the ship and May said they were in over mode and asked if she couldn't be useful there, but Coulson asked her to stay on the Zephyr One, given her skills as a pilot and that He did not trust Davis so much, to whom the latter said he was in complete agreement with Coulson and Mackenzie reminded the latter not to forget to blow the oxygen, as he would have gone mad without it.

Johnson asked Fitz and May if they received them, to which the two of them said they heard them loud and clear and Coulson admitted that it was strange for him to wander around on a ship 25,000 feet high and Johnson asked how that was possible and Fitz said that the Gravitonium had been charged after being struck by lightning, creating a gravitational field and Shaw explained that it worked like the Gravitonium of his belt and this meant that there must be more of it on the ship than he thought.

After making sure there was a green light on deck 1 of the ship, Coulson and the others discovered the perfectly preserved corpses of the crew, to which Simmons said it must be a case of severe hypoxia and, arriving in the engine room Johnson discovered the container. of the empty Gravitonium, to which he told that whoever was there had not left empty-handed and Simmons asked what was holding the ship in the air if there was no Gravitonium, to which Shaw said it was not possible, since he believed there was Gravitonium in the ship and Mackenzie called Coulson and Johnson, saying he had found it.

Coulson saw that there was not all the Gravitonium and that it was the size of a ball, suspecting that they had separated it from the rest and Fitz replied that it should not be touched or moved, since it generates the gravitational field that keeps it in the air and Johnson he said they wouldn't leave him there. Shaw asked if there was a plastic container on the ship, to which Mackenzie said yes and Shaw said to box it without touching it, to take it away and that they had 90 seconds, before the gravitational field clears, thus giving way to Earth's gravity. to crash the ship, to which Coulson said they could do it.

After Mackenzie successfully captured the Gravitonium, Coulson and the others calculated that they had one minute and thirty seconds to abandon ship. However, before going to the bridge, they encountered a robot who cut their way and Mackenzie complained that the robots are not two, but three and four, as Coulson said there was another one and they began a fierce fight against the robots, although May said they had to leave immediately and Mackenzie offered to keep them busy enough to give Coulson and Johnson time to escape and afterwards he would return with these dead robots.

After they returned to the Zephyr One, Coulson politely apologized to Caine for involving him in this matter and thanked him for the help he gave for the S.H.I.E.L.D., to which the latter said it was a wonderful day, seeing a ship. flying and a robot fight and Coulson said they would take him home with a Quinjet and made sure to shake Caine's hand as a reward for helping. Coulson then left the scene.

Return of the Lighthouse
Following the completion of the mission to the Principia ship, Coulson and the others returned to the Lighthouse and were surprised to see Rodriguez standing and Coulson himself handed Fitz the Gravitonium ball he had asked for and the latter asked Shaw to come with him and Simmons saw how likeable they began, Fitz and Shaw and Coulson hoped the Gravitonium was enough, suspecting, however, that Hale has the rest and May said that Hale was much more than a zealous general, which Coulson agreed with and he left the scene with May, Simmons and Johnson.

The Gravitonium Threat
Capture of Hale
After delivering the Gravitonium to Fitz to close the rift, Coulson and the others flew the Zephyr One in search of Hale, but found no trace of her, being good and cunning at not getting noticed, but, thankfully, thanks to Johnson, who sent the coordinates to Coulson about Hale's location, in order to set an ingenious trap for her, shielding the Zephyr and letting her aboard without his knowledge and throwing a gas grenade to make her pass out and Coulson told Piper she was right about the the fact that she wanted to redeem herself and that she was doing her first step well, to which Piper confessed that she was happy to get the better of Hale for the first time and  May replied if she expects the military to have encrypted phones. Coulson then ordered May to call the Lighthouse to confirm that they have taken the general.

While they are flying to the base, Coulson went to talk to Hale, who the latter commented on how many materials the interrogation room was made up of, humorously asking him if he expected Dep Metal and Coulson said he was not here to torture her, but to make two chatting with her and asking questions that had been buzzing in his head for many months, such as why he declared war on S.H.I.E.L.D.

Hale commented on her being melodramatic and said that she was an Air Force General, while he was the head of a terrorist organization and Coulson himself had to be brought to justice and the latter said that bringing to justice and killing are very different things. , but Hale said she was ordered to stop S.H.I.E.L.D. by any means possible.
Coulson, however, asked Hale if cutting off his agents' arms, as happened to Rodriguez, was his plan.

Hale sincerely apologized for that fact and said that one of his subordinates had been overzealous, telling Coulson that he certainly understood this, as Johnson had shot Talbot, but Coulson firmly reiterated that she hadn't shot him, but a replicant of her, to whom Hale sarcastically commented on his defense against him and also commented on his motto to get behind his shield and be protected from everything, which is why they follow him blindly, to whom Coulson said that all these words have only one: loyalty.

Hale commented, however, that loyalty has a limit that must not be exceeded and that it takes more to fulfill its purpose, which is to prevent the extinction of humanity, to which Coulson said it is his prerogative to save the humanity. Hale said that very powerful dark forces are involved and that he had a greater advantage over them and Coulson asked why he wanted Gravitonium and what he wanted to save Earth from.

Hale said that although she understood and admired Coulson, she still didn't trust him and he told her that he doesn't give off any positive vibes at all and that the feelings they had towards each other were not mutual and Hale contradicted him, saying that positivity, charisma and empathy had brought him to where he was now, but that it would never take him over his limit and that he had lost sleep, making very difficult choices, but that he did what he was necessary to save the world, although she admitted that sometimes the dead would escape them too, but that she was willing to shoot mercilessly and Coulson said that there was still some humanity left in her and that on the other side there was the right person and Hale tried to persuade him to help her be one and wanted to ask him to come with him so that he could find out what they were going to face.

Coulson, however, declined the offer, sarcastically commenting that he never took orders from a passenger. Hale was still struck by the S.H.I.E.L.D.'s cunning, but revealed with a smile that she had always been in the driver's seat, telling him if they thought they were cracking her phone without her knowing and if they believed they were underestimating her, revealing that Carl Creel was also in the driver's seat. board with explosives ready to go off if Hale hadn't been released.

Subsequently, the radar of the Zephyr One signaled the arrival of a Quinjet and Coulson and May, along with Piper, went to greet with weapons the guest who is about to descend and Coulson told Piper not to blame herself, since everything this was just Coulson's own fault and Piper said it would be safer for her to jump downstairs, to which May told her to think about the idea, but, before she could finish, the Quinjet's door opened, revealing inside Anton Ivanov, saying he was happy to see Coulson face to face, asking him if he expected to see him alive, to which Coulson said sarcastically that there had to be a replicant of him somewhere, since, every time he killed a Ivanov's body, a new body of him was created and Ivanov himself said that this time it had become much more difficult to kill. 

Coulson, in turn, commented on how his humanity was much more superior, to which Ivanov said that he redefined very well, this time, the basic concept of humanity, telling him that, although some parts of him will always be human, he had gained a lot, in being a Life-Model Decoy, giving it a strength and immortality that not even Ivanov himself dreamed of having, asking Coulson what he thought of it as a beginning. May, however, asked him if he had risen to a new life or asked if he was one of the other Russians threatening democracy, to whom Ivanov said humanity was in danger of mass extinction and will ensure its survival for hundreds of thousands of generations, thanks to its advantage of being a Life-Model Decoy, and Hale herself was a very important part of this project, which Coulson humorously asked if she was keeping her on a leash. Ivanov threatened Coulson to deliver it, otherwise Creel would have detonated the Zephyr One, also saying that there would be no survivors, except Creel and Ivanov himself, thanks to their superhuman durability and patiently awaited Hale's arrival. 

After the latter arrived, Coulson asked her if her moralistic facade had dried up, as she used robots built by terrorists, as Hale herself was next to the man who wanted to manipulate the council to turn Humans against Inhuman and that caused the Glenn Talbot accident and Creel said that it was Johnson who shot Talbot, as he had seen the footage and May tried to tell him that it was not the real Johnson, but a replicant of his programmed by Ivanov himself and Hale retorted that all the androids were created by Leo Fitz himself and that, if they didn't want to believe her, they had to quarter Ivanov piece by piece to prove it, since the electronics reminded her a lot of S.H.I.E.L.D. technology. and Coulson tried to say that such a thing had never happened before, which Hale asked to prove it and Ivanov enjoyed so much that Coulson himself was not in control of anything. Hale, however, wanted to try to explain to him, as he knew nothing of his plans, asking him to come with him, despite May's fierce objections that he would not go anywhere and Coulson asked if the latter's men would were spared, if he agreed to come with her, to which Hale agreed to the deal. 

May, however, angrily asked Hale to give her a second with him, taking him aside and getting angry at Coulson that he can't be serious about going with Hale, but Coulson reiterated that, in order to have a plan in defeating her and counterattacking her, she must first know what plans Hale is working on, to try to get clarity, as they were always one step behind her and Hale herself had the advantage over all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and she swore to May that she would do it with her or without her her discussion of her, even though she knew perfectly well it was a very convincing trap, but she had to risk it. 

May tried to persuade him not to go with her and not turn his back on her, but Coulson told her with desperation that what she is doing is inevitable and she no longer wanted to listen to her alternatives, although May said fiercely that what she was doing was suicide and that the latter argument was very recurrent with him at this time and Coulson, becoming more angry than her, said he did not want to wash his dirty clothes in front of the enemy, and May commented with disgust that he was considerate even of his enemies, but eventually she resigned herself, telling Hale that it was all hers.

When he boarded the Quinjet, Ivanov handed him a hood and asked him to give him his arm to check he had no weapons and Coulson sarcastically commented that it was the second worst party invitation he had ever had and Creel asked him for the second time to put on that hood, to which Coulson desperately tried to tell Creel that Hale was manipulating him and Ivanov commented on Coulson's climbing on the mirrors to save his skin and the latter, in turn, commented in a funny way that he was still here and he hadn't left and asked him, taking off his arm and handing it over, why his robots don't have a face and Ivanov said they were just soldiers ready for battle. 

Coulson, however, openly suspected that the reason Ivanov himself built that kind of robot, the Sleeper Mechs, was because he could no longer replicate so many bodies of himself since Aida disappeared, noting that Hale was in the flesh. and that Ivanov no longer made decisions by himself, asking him if Hale was holding him by the balls, but the latter told him, starting the Quinjet commands that he had his head in a jar, revealing to him that he had found Ivanov's biological head and kept it with him.

Battle of Chicago
Coulson was lying unconscious aboard Zephyr One in a hospital bed hooked up to various monitors. He was near death. Nearby, members of his team argued about whether to use the last remaining dose of Centipede Serum to save his life, or to combine it with the single vial of Odium they had and somehow use it to defeat Glenn Talbot and prevent him from destroying the Earth.

Rodriguez visited Coulson after he regained consciousness. She let him know that she was never arguing for him to die; she was just looking at the big picture. Coulson assured her he would have taken her side in the argument.

Simmons entered with the Serum and told Coulson it was almost identical to the formula that had kept John Garrett alive, but with extra mojo. Coulson reminded her of what happened to Garrett and the test subjects from Project T.A.H.I.T.I. He warned that bad things can happen when they don't let nature take her course. May came into the room and told Coulson they had gone through a lot to get the Serum. He replied that he wasn't happy he had been left out of that decision. Coulson let May know he was OK with dying but he was having a hard time leaving her. She said, "So don't," and left the Serum on his bedside table.

Meanwhile, they learned that Talbot had made an appearance in Chicago, crashing Qovas' Ship into downtown skyscrapers. The team set out aboard the Zephyr. Johnson announced that she didn't feel that she could hold the team together, but thought Mackenzie could. She called for a vote and Mackenzie was unanimously elected the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Just then Coulson entered. He was dressed and walking and looked like his old self. Everyone assumed he had injected himself with the Centipede Serum. He told Johnson to suit up and handed her her Quake Gauntlets, where he had secretly hidden the serum. He then looked to Mackenzie and asked what they should do. Mackenzie replied, "We save lives."

When the team reached Chicago, Mackenzie, Fitz and May went to rescue civilians trapped on the top floors of buildings Talbot had crashed into. Coulson and Johnson went to confront Talbot on the Quinjet piloted by James Davis. Johnson told Coulson she would hit Talbot hard and restrain him so that Coulson could get close and talk him down. Coulson confessed that he could barely stand. Johnson realized he had not taken the Scorpion Serum. She said Coulson was the only one who could reach Talbot. Coulson told her he had given her all the tools she needed to face Talbot, that she should appeal to his good nature and if that didn't work, she should beat his ass senseless. He opened the Quinjet door and Johnson walked out shouting to Coulson to fly back and take the Serum. When she was out of sight, Coulson collapsed in his seat.

While Johnson fought against Talbot, Davis flew the Quinjet back to the Zephyr and dragged the unconscious Coulson to Simmons. She didn't understand what was wrong with him, then Davis told her Coulson had not taken the Serum. Rodriguez started giving Coulson chest compressions while asking for his forgiveness. Eventually, Coulson was revived.

Retirement
Leaving the Team
Coulson giving his retirement speech
Back on Zephyr One after the Battle of Chicago, the team gathered looking somber. Melinda May poured drinks for everyone and Alphonso Mackenzie passed them around. Coulson quipped that it was a celebration, not a funeral. But in the wake of Leo Fitz's death and Coulson's failing health, nobody was feeling very festive for Coulson's retirement party.

Coulson gave a speech about how he had spent his life surrounded by heroes, including the people in that room, and that losing good people is part of the job description. He said they didn't have to forget, but they had to move on. Jemma Simmons said he was wrong and that people don't move on. They just close off that part of their heart. Coulson said he regretted not being able to say goodbye to Fitz, but he knew Simmons would tell Fitz for him.

James Davis had been busy hanging a plaque. It read: "In remembrance of our fearless leader/Philip J. Coulson/He gave us his wisdom, his love and his life (a couple of times)."

Simmons gave Coulson the postcard of the Lighthouse, as a keepsake of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s new headquarters and to remind him that his team always worked the problem, no matter what. It was the postcard Fitz had written as a message to the team when everyone except him had been abducted and sent to the future. The back read, "Working on it. -Fitz". Coulson assured Simmons that she would find him. They hugged.

Coulson proposed a toast and Yo-Yo Rodriguez hugged him and thanked him. Mackenzie told Coulson he would be calling him for advice as the new Director. Coulson replied that he wouldn't need it and they hugged.

He approached Daisy Johnson, his protégé whom he loved as a daughter. Johnson asked how long he had left to live and Coulson said he had days, weeks if he was lucky. He told her he left her a letter in her bunk telling her how proud he was of her. They hugged and Johnson said she loved him. Colson replied that he loved her, too. Johnson then thanked him for the "spaceship".

Coulson and Melinda May enjoying the view
Coulson picked up his duffel bag, preparing to depart the Zephyr for the last time. He turned and looked back at his team while holding back tears, then pulled his sunglasses from his jacket pocket and put them on. He stepped off the plane onto white sand and uttered the words, "Gotta say… it's pretty magical." May stepped beside him and asked what else was on his bucket list. Coulson said there was just one thing. May asked, "Parasailing?" Coulson jokingly replied that he had always wanted to try that, then he took May's hand. May rested her head on Colson's shoulder and the two looked skyward as the Zephyr flew off overhead.

Final Days in Tahiti
Coulson passes away in his sleep
Coulson spent his last weeks in Tahiti with Melinda May, talking about their lives and discussing May's idea to recreate S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy in his name. While drinking wine on the beach, Coulson began to feel the pain in his chest once more, and informed May. The pair soon fell asleep on the beach, and Coulson died in his sleep.

Legacy
Remembered Fondly
Coulson was greatly missed by all his S.H.I.E.L.D. colleagues, especially Melinda May and Daisy Johnson. After Coulson's death, May returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. to honor his memory and not let his death paralyze her. Johnson, however, had difficulty moving on after Coulson's death. She chose to help Jemma Simmons in her search for Leo Fitz in deep space, because everything on Earth reminded her of Coulson. It wasn't until a year later that Johnson finally read the letter Coulson had left for her. It brought her to tears, but finally gave her some closure.

Duplicate Self
Unknown to everyone, when Coulson closed the rift to an alleged Fear Dimension, the Space, Time, and Creation Di'Allas created a copy of him that was sent through time and space hundreds of years ago and to a world inhabited by non-corporeal beings, where an individual known as Pachakutiq took over his body. When this happened, Coulson's memories intermingled with Pachakutiq's in a fashion that caused both sets of memories to be clouded. Pachakutiq mistakenly believed that he had had a family that his lover Izel had murdered. This led him to start a crusade to kill her and wipe out the Shrike, adopting the name Sarge. His evil doppelgänger and Izel were eventually killed by Alphonso Mackenzie, before they could doom Earth.

Chronicom LMD
When the team was forced to travel back to the 20th Century to escape the Chronicom Hunters, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons and Enoch created a Chronicom Life-Model Decoy version of Coulson to help them navigate the past. They gave the LMD all of Coulson's memories and the added knowledge of all the events that had occurred since Coulson's death.

Personality
Philip J. Coulson was a dedicated company man who believed in the principles of S.H.I.E.L.D. and felt that his work within that organization helped make the world a better, safer place. As an agent, he always remained calm in a crisis, was competent and resourceful, fearless, heroic and exhibited his trademark cool, dry wit. As Director, Coulson inspired the loyalty of his team by being compassionate, humble, encouraging, willing to get his hands dirty and always willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good. 

Coulson was never ambitious or power hungry. His ego never factored into his decisions. He never relished being the public face of S.H.I.E.L.D. or having to play political games as director. That is why he willingly surrendered the title to Jeffrey Mace and returned to being an agent when S.H.I.E.L.D. was re-legitimized. However, Coulson didn’t agree with the way Mace ran the agency and he disobeyed orders by continuing to search for Daisy Johnson after Mace pulled him off the mission. When he learned that Mace was not an Inhuman, he was able to use the information to regain his power to call the shots, becoming the shadow director, minus the title and the politics.

Coulson devoted his entire life to his job and it left little time for outside interests or relationships. Perhaps that was why his greatest regret, which was reversed when he was imprisoned in the Framework, was joining S.H.I.E.L.D. In that virtual world, Coulson followed in his father’s footsteps, becoming a high school history teacher. He got the normal life he sometimes wished he had chosen, but with HYDRA in power, that life was far from fulfilling. He was divorced and living alone, teaching HYDRA propaganda and standing by while his students were arrested.

In the real world, Coulson never found the time to marry or raise children, but he grew close to his team and they became his surrogate family. Coulson was a warm, compassionate father figure to the younger members of his team. He was always concerned for their welfare, dispensing wisdom and hugs, scolding them when they needed it and dishing out dad-jokes.

He considered Daisy Johnson the closest thing he had to a daughter. He rescued her when she was held captive by Grant Ward, helped her find her parents, refused to stop searching for her when she went rogue, fought to save her life when she was shot and, when Johnson believed she would cause the destruction of Earth and refused to go through the time portal, Coulson I.C.E.d her in order to ensure she made it back to their own timeline. He mentored her, challenged her to be a better agent and tagged her to be his successor when the time came.

Coulson also acted paternalistically toward Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz. When Simmons was infected with the alien virus, Felix Blake ordered Coulson to sacrifice her to save the rest of his team. Coulson disobeyed the direct order. After Simmons jumped off the Bus to avoid infecting the others, Coulson scolded her for what she had put him through. Inside the Framework, even with only fragments of his memory, Coulson put himself in front of Simmons during a firefight and then defended her against Mace who was angry she had prevented Grant Ward from killing Fitz. Before attempting to close the dimensional rift in the basement of the Lighthouse and possibly being killed, Coulson made Fitz promise to go through with his marriage proposal to Simmons, whether he survived the basement or not. They shared a warm moment which Fitz could never have had with his own father. When Simmons and Fitz later got married, Coulson walked Fitz down the aisle and officiated the ceremony.

At his retirement party, knowing he had only days left to live, Coulson spent time with each of his team members, consoling them and giving them words of encouragement, rather than making the moment about himself. He told Simmons he believed she would find Fitz. He let Alphonso Mackenzie know he believed in him and thought he was ready to lead. He told Johnson he was proud of her and that he loved her. Then he went off with Melinda May to Tahiti for a taste of the normal life he had missed out on.

Work in progress, more to come...
