Gertrude "Gert" Yorkes is the daughter of Dale and Stacey Yorkes and the adoptive sister of Molly Hernandez. Upon reuniting with her childhood friends, they discovered that their parents used PRIDE to cover up ceremonial sacrifices of the Church of Gibborim. She and Hernandez also found out that Dale and Stacey genetically engineered a Deinonychus, with whom Gert shared a telepathic link, being able to control the dinosaur. She teamed up with her friends and formed the Runaways, to stop PRIDE. Having been framed for Destiny Gonzalez's murder, and with no other choice, they were forced to run.

However, life on the run turned out to be particularly difficult for Gert, since she was deprived of her anti-anxiety meds which usually helped her. Although she tried to find some comfort in her connection with Old Lace and her new relationship with Chase Stein, Gert ultimately decided to leave the Hostel where the Runaways had sought refuge to go to a hospital. She was signed out thanks to Janet Stein, but this episode deeply affected her relationship with Stein. Later, Gert began to feel ill once again, this time because Old Lace had actually been poisoned by the Magistrate's Wife, causing Gert to psychosomatically suffer from the same symptoms. Since they were out of options, Gert was taken to her parents by Stein, who cured Old Lace but attempted to keep Gert and Stein from leaving again. Eventually, Gert was rescued, but broke up with Stein as he chose to come home and joined PRIDE. During a confrontation between the Runaways and PRIDE, Gert was captured by Dale, who decided to take her away from both the Runaways and PRIDE.

Using this time to learn how to better control her connection with Old Lace, Gert then left on her own after they were attacked by the Magistrate's Wife. She was thus able to reunite with the Runaways, but later fell under the influence of a Corvus phone made by Morgan le Fay. Although her relationship with Stein initially remained tense after he rejoined the team, they were slowly able to work things out and rekindled their romance. Yorkes then took part in the last battle against le Fay, during which a future Stein came to her and explained that he would take her place so that she would not die when confronting the enchantress.

Biography
Early Life
Yorkes in 2007
Gertrude Yorkes was born in 2001 to Dale Yorkes and Stacey Yorkes. She was childhood friends with Amy Minoru, Alex Wilder, Chase Stein, Karolina Dean, and Nico Minoru as they used to play together while their parents held secret meetings for the organization PRIDE. Like the rest of her friends, Yorkes attended the funeral of Gene and Alice Hernandez. While in eighth grade at Atlas Academy, Yorkes and Stein were partners in an astronomy project, much to her annoyance as Yorkes did all the work while Stein flirted with Eiffel on text messages.

Reunion
Sacrifice of Destiny Gonzalez
Yorkes talking about her group
Having grown feminist convictions, Yorkes proposed the creation of a group, "Undermining the Patriarchy" in the Atlas Academy, although her classmates did not pay much attention to her proposal. Once Yorkes had finished, she overheard Alex Wilder inviting Chase Stein for a reunion in the Wilder Mansion as they used to do. However, the conversation quickly got tense with the intervention of Karolina Dean who began arguing with Yorkes, and it soon appeared that the reunion would not take place.

Yorkes offers to tutor Chase Stein in spanish
Instead of the reunion, Yorkes approached Stein and offered to help him with studying Spanish. As they planned to meet for a coffee and work together, Yorkes prepared some rehearsal sheets for Stein in prevision of their evening. However, despite Yorkes patiently waiting for Stein at the Timely Coffee, Stein never showed up. As Yorkes grew more and more annoyed and asked Molly Hernandez to feed the pets at the Yorkes Residence, she received a picture from Wilder showing Yorkes and her former friends. Filled with nostalgia, Yorkes decided to go to the Wilder Mansion, where all the other teenagers went as well.

The group soon argued about their separation following the death of their friend Amy Minoru. Convinced by Dean that they should talk about it, the teenagers went to Geoffrey Wilder's office to find some alcohol. However, by doing so they accidentally revealed a secret passage may in the office, leading to a hidden basement.

Yorkes is shocked by the Rite of Blood
Arriving at an underground hall, Yorkes and the others were surprised to spot their parents dressed in strange red robes and gathered around a strange box. As they realized that their parents could not hear them due to a mysterious barrier, Yorkes and the others watched as Destiny Gonzalez, a young member of the Church of Gibborim, was brought among the members of the PRIDE. Fearing that the situation was wrong, Yorkes pushed Molly Hernandez back so she could not see anything.

Yorkes playing Twister with the group
As the mysterious ceremony continued without Yorkes being able to tell what was happening, they soon realized that their parents were apparently killing Gonzalez in some sort of ritual. However, before they could observe further, Hernandez took a picture with her phone, alerting their parents and forcing the teenagers to flee and hide in the guesthouse. While Alex left to cut the power in the mansion to distract their parents, Yorkes and the other teenagers tried to figure out what they had seen. In order to leave their parents not suspicious, the group pretended to be playing Twister in the guesthouse.

Yorkes and the teenagers then discussed about what they had witnessed. When it was suggested that their parents could be criminals, she expressed her utter disbelief that her parents could do anything wrong to anyone. Since they needed to know more, they decided to return to their parents and act as normal as they could. This proved to be quite a challenge for Yorkes, who acted as way too enthusiastic when her mother offered to take her back home.

Yorkes sings lullaby for her sister Molly Hernandez
Once at home, in her bedroom, Yorkes was approached by Hernandez who asked her whether she could stay for the night. Yorkes accepted, and Hernandez tried to tell her that there was something wrong with her, with Yorkes replying that it might be the case for the whole group. She then reluctantly agreed to sing a lullaby for Hernandez so they could go to sleep.

Cretacean Encounter
Yorkes assumes Molly Hernandez is having panic attacks
Yorkes received a message from Alex Wilder asking the teenagers to come to the beach in order to discuss the recent events. Before leaving, she went to see Molly Hernandez in her bedroom as she searched for a hairpin she had lost. Yorkes initially dismissed it as not important, but then recalled that the hairpin had been given to Hernandez by her deceased mother. When Hernandez once again told Yorkes that she might have a problem, Yorkes hypothesized that it could be panic attacks just like Yorkes suffered from. They then went to the beach, being joined by Chase Stein right before they arrived.

Yorkes meets with the Runaways
The meeting began with Karolina Dean showing the group a picture of Destiny Gonzalez seemingly on a trip to London, which would have indicated that she was alive and well. However, since this was not solid enough evidence, they explored other possibilities, with Yorkes surmising that their parents could have been performing some live-action role play. Yorkes was then enthusiastic when Wilder suggested that they conducted their own investigation on PRIDE's activities, and offered Stein to be his lookout while he would search through his father's lab, after which they could rehearse for his upcoming Spanish test.

Yorkes tests the X-Ray Specs
Yorkes and Stein began leaving the beach as Dean approached Stein, desiring to talk to him in private despite Yorkes attempting to rebuff her. Yorkes then went to the Stein Mansion to help Stein with his investigation, although she tended to inform him that there was no one coming too frequently. Yorkes then reviewed the equipment in the lab, noticing the X-Ray Specs she put on, although she promptly removed it when Stein figured out that she was watching him, including his genitals, with the glasses.

Yorkes inspect the Dematerialization Box
Yorkes then discovered that there was something hidden behind a piece of furniture, and once they removed it, they found the Dematerialization Box which had been used by PRIDE during their ritual. Fearing that Gonzalez could still be inside, Yorkes used the X-Ray Specs to inspect the box, which turned out to be empty. However, although Stein called their investigation over, Yorkes suggested that they could go and check the basement of the Yorkes Residence, in which Hernandez claimed to have heard some noise which she linked to some kind of monster.

Yorkes and Chase Stein are confronted by a dinosaur
Initially, Yorkes and Stein remained outside the house, using the X-Ray Specs to inspect it from afar, but Stein then insisted that they should go inside and make a more thorough investigation despite Yorkes' reluctance. Before going into the basement, Yorkes put on a leather apron which prevented Stein from seeing her body through the X-Ray Specs, much to his dismay as he considered this unfair. Upon finding a sealed door through which Stein was unable to see, they agreed to open it, which caused the release of a strange creature, which turned out to be an actual dinosaur.

Yorkes and Stein attempted to flee, but were confronted by the dinosaur which roared at them, causing Yorkes to have a panic attack. Yorkes did her best to calm down and breathed heavily, until Stein noticed that the dinosaur seemed to actually obey Yorkes' commands of standing down. The dinosaur then fled upon hearing a car honk outside, leaving Yorkes and Stein profoundly shocked by the whole event, with Yorkes being hugged in comfort by Stein.

Yorkes joins a WizTalk conversation
Yorkes later took part in a WizTalk conversation in which the teenagers shared the thin results of their investigation and discussed the recent discovery of Gonzalez's body on the beach. Yorkes was shocked when Nico Minoru suggested that PRIDE could even have murdered her sister Amy. She also expressed embarrassment when Hernandez once again tried to tell the team about her abilities, which the teenagers were still unaware of. The call was ended shortly afterwards with the decision to carry on the investigation.

In the next morning, Yorkes found her parents in a tense conversation about an animal having gone missing from the lab. Although they claimed that it was only a hedgehog, Yorkes and Hernandez obviously figured out that they were talking about the dinosaur which had escaped the night before. They then went to Atlas Academy, where Yorkes approached Stein to thank him for not having mentioned the dinosaur to the other teenagers. She then witnessed the brawl between Stein and his lacrosse teammates over what had happened involving Dean during a party. Remaining with Dean, Yorkes suggested that Stein was trying to protect her by not telling her what had happened during the party.

Yorkes with Karolina Dean
Later, while discussing with members of her club Undermining the Patriarchy, Yorkes was approached by Dean, who suggested going to the Dean Mansion to find some evidence to explain their parents' behavior and prove their innocence. Yorkes offered Wilder to join them, but he refused, leaving only the two girls to find out whether the teenagers had only witnessed a Church of Gibborim ceremony. During their search, Yorkes and Dean found an encrypted file on Leslie Dean's laptop and decided to give it to Wilder for him to decrypt.

Yorkes protects Molly Hernandez from the dinosaur
Yorkes left the Dean Mansion as Stein had arrived to discuss with Dean in private. After giving the file to Wilder, she returned to her home, only to find Hernandez nearly engaging in a fight with the escaped dinosaur, which had returned home as well. Yorkes arrived in time to order the dinosaur to stand down, thus confirming that the creature obeyed her. As their parents arrived and were surprised by the dinosaur's return, Yorkes asked for an explanation regarding its very existence. Before she could have it, however, her parents were distracted by Tina Minoru's visit. Still, Yorkes was delighted to learn that the dinosaur was a female.

Kidnapping of Alex Wilder
Yorkes and the Runaways looking for Alex Wilder
Yorkes was informed by Nico Minoru and Karolina Dean that Alex Wilder had been abducted by unidentified kidnappers and rushed to the Timely Coffee with Molly Hernandez to join her teammates. Although she agreed that they had to rescue Wilder, Yorkes insisted that this was a dangerous situation and that they had no weapon safe for the Staff of One brought by Minoru. She suggested waiting for Chase Stein to see her messages regarding Wilder's abduction, but ultimately agreed to get into Dean's and kept attempting to contact Stein.

Yorkes and the Runaways ready to stop Darius Davis
Despite Dean's dangerous driving, Yorkes was eventually able to get Stein on the phone and updated him, sending him GPS coordinates for him to join. In the meantime, Yorkes and the group managed to find Wilder, but only to see him held at gunpoint by Darius Davis, who took him away once again. Yorkes insisted that one of them could get killed if they kept chasing Davis, but the group proceeded all the same. Yorkes then witnessed the teenagers' superhuman abilities put to good use to stop Davis: Hernandez's superhuman strength, Dean's light beams, Stein's Fistigons and Minoru blocking Davis' bullets with the Staff of One.

Yorkes at the Timely Coffee
Once Davis fled, Yorkes joined the other teenagers at the Timely Coffee, where Wilder asked them to help him to save Andre Compton from PRIDE, as he feared they would sacrifice him. Yorkes tried to talk him out of it, calling the night crazy enough, which got even weirder when Hernandez revealed Yorkes' connection with a dinosaur. In the end, however, Yorkes agreed to join the group to the Wilder Mansion to save Compton, but they failed as PRIDE had apparently decided to carry out the ritual somewhere else.

Yorkes and Molly Hernandez hide from their parents with their dinosaur
The group's visit in the Wilder Mansion was not in vain, however, since they found a camera in the sacrifice room and figured out that its data were stored in Wizard servers, meaning that they had to hack into the company. Following this discovery, Yorkes and Hernandez returned Yorkes Residence and paid the dinosaur a visit, staying with it in its sealed room and discussing their parents' motives, and Yorkes had to accept that her parents might be evil people.

Infiltration into Wizard Headquarters
Yorkes and the Runaways discuss their new mission
Yorkes and Molly Hernandez went to the Timely Coffee to discuss the Runaways' plan to steal the video file they were looking for from Wizard servers. Yorkes told the teenagers that they should arrive in Wizard Headquarters together, which was accepted, and all the teenagers confirmed that they were willing to have their parents arrested. Yorkes and Hernandez later went to the Dean Mansion to prepare for the upcoming PRIDE gala with Karolina Dean and Nico Minoru. Upon arriving, Yorkes sensed that there was something going on between Dean and Minoru, but remained silent about it.

During the drive to Wizard Headquarters, Yorkes expressed annoyance and jealousy due to Chase Stein acting too familiar to her taste with Dean. Once they arrived, she and the group saw PRIDE being acclaimed by the audience, and commented that the gala would be the last time their parents would be able to have fun before being sent to prison.

Yorkes argues with Karolina Dean
Yorkes then regrouped with the other Runaways to prepare for their mission, but before they proceeded, she asked Dean for a word in private. Yorkes then told Dean that she would support a relationship between Dean and Minoru, but she was rebuffed by Dean, who replied that Yorkes only said so because she wanted to be with Stein. Despite Yorkes denying that she was attracted to Stein, Dean saw through it and told her that she should be more honest about who she wanted to be with, just like Yorkes advised Dean earlier.

Yorkes playing Star Wars to distract Earl
Yorkes then went with Alex Wilder and Minoru in order to infiltrate into the servers room. Yorkes was sent to distract security guard Earl, engaging in a conversation with him about Franz Kafka, which enabled Wilder and Minoru to access the elevator without Earl noticing. However, Earl eventually realized that someone might have slipped through his watch. In order to keep him distracted, Yorkes began playing with an Star Wars arcade game with had been offered to Tina Minoru by her husband.

Yorkes is seen by Tina Minoru with Earl and Kincaid
As they were playing together, Yorkes and Earl were approached by Kincaid, Tina's bodyguard, who ordered them to step aside from the arcade game. However, Yorkes was eventually able to convince him to play as well, thus keeping the security's attention away from what happened in the upper floors of the building. Nevertheless, they briefly stopped playing upon noticing Tina's approaching and taking the elevator, although she did not speak a word to them. Fearing that Tina might her teammates, Yorkes texted them to warn them.

Yorkes eventually saw Wilder and Minoru safely leaving the elevator, meaning that the mission was accomplished. She managed to step away from Earl and Kincaid, who had become flirtatious toward her. She joined Hernandez and asked her whether she knew where Stein was. However, she was told by Hernandez that she had seen him kissing Dean, leaving Yorkes deeply saddened.

Sister Gone
In the next day, at Atlas Academy, Yorkes approached Alex Wilder, Nico Minoru, Karolina Dean and Chase Stein, with her attitude clearly signalling a form of jealousy since she thought Dean and Stein were dating. However, during the conversation, Molly Hernandez dropped the double-helix model she had made for the school open house and angrily reacted, prompting Yorkes to ask her whether she was all right. This caused Hernandez to reveal to Yorkes and the group that she had inadvertently told Wilder's mother that she knew about the secret rituals.

Yorkes and Molly Hernandez with their parents at Atlas Academy
Shocked by this reveal, Yorkes regretted that Hernandez had not been able to lie about it, but it only caused Hernandez to get angry and leave the group. The open house then began, and while Tezuka delivered a speech, Yorkes noticed that her father behaved strangely, grunting and complaining about the light, unaware that he was actually on withdrawal from Jonah's Serum. During the open house, Yorkes approached Hernandez, who had tried to join the school's dance squad only to be given the most menial tasks. As Yorkes insisted that her adoptive sister could show more self-respect, Hernandez pointed out that Yorkes had apparently lost leadership of her own club, Undermining the Patriarchy.

Yorkes then joined the rest of the group as they had figured out that her parents and the Wilders were probably talking about Hernandez knowing about the sacrifices. They also discussed the decryption of the video file stolen from Wizard, and Yorkes stated that their parents had to be put behind bars. Yorkes then lamented that they would then remain with only Frank Dean as an adult figure.

Yorkes learns that her adoptive sister is leaving
Back to the Yorkes Residence, Yorkes was astonished upon discovering that her parents were planning on sending Hernandez away to Montebello. She stated that they were only causing her adoptive sister's worst nightmare to become true, and then remarked that the tension could cause Hernandez to manifest her powers. She thus took Hernandez away from her room and the two sisters had an emotional conversation in which Yorkes convinced Hernandez to leave for her own safety, assuring her that they would remain sisters forever.

Yorkes receives a call from Karolina Dean
Yorkes later figured out that something did not feel right as her parents were not returning from Montebello. Refusing to remain alone, she went down into the residence's basement and released the dinosaur from her room, bringing her into her own bedroom. Yorkes was then called by Dean, who informed her that Stein apparently needed help. Yorkes seized this opportunity to tell Dean that Hernandez was gone, and then asked Dean why she had bothered calling her in the first place. However, she figured out that Dean did not want to go alone to the Stein Mansion, because of Stein's unrequited feelings towards her, since Dean was infatuated with Minoru.

Yorkes with Karolina Dean at the Stein Mansion
Yorkes agreed to go and pick up Dean before going to the Stein Mansion. As she hung up, Yorkes was delighted to see that Stein had actually tried to call her before Dean. The two girls, along with the dinosaur, then drove to the Stein Mansion. As they arrived in front of the house, another man in a car arrived, and Dean identified him as someone she had met at the PRIDE gala, apparently a friend of her mother. They then left the car and silently broke into the Stein Mansion, with Yorkes instructing the dinosaur to be as quiet as possible.

Yorkes petting the dinosaur
Yorkes and the dinosaur remained in Stein's bedroom until Stein returned from the mansion's hall after meeting Dean. Yorkes assured him that having the dinosaur around was of no danger. The teenagers then left the Stein Mansion for the Timely Coffee, where Wilder and Minoru awaited them with the decrypted PRIDE file. This led to an argument among the group as Stein claimed that they could not release the evidence out of fear for his father's life. Yorkes was then left helpless and unable to stop the ensuing brawl between Wilder and Stein, which caused the laptop to be destroyed with all the evidence against PRIDE on it.

Infiltration into the PRIDE Construction Site
Yorkes and the Runaways discuss their next move
In the next day, at Atlas Academy, Yorkes, along with Alex Wilder and Karolina Dean, watched as Chase Stein was being comforted by his lacrosse teammates while Wilder resented him for the events of the night before. Yorkes once again acted jealous towards Dean by claiming that Dean seemingly defended Stein for his actions only because they had shared a kiss during the PRIDE gala. Once Stein joined them, Yorkes remained mostly silent during the ensuing argument, but voiced her opposition to disband the group of friends. As she remarked that they had not given themselves a nickname, Wilder suggested the name Runaways, which Yorkes and the others deemed too dark.

Yorkes and the group then followed Wilder as he walked away. They walked by Eiffel, who was selling tickets for the upcoming school dance. Upon witnessing Eiffel trying to seduce Stein and insulting Dean, Yorkes grew annoyed by her schoolmate and angrily stated that they would all go to the dance together, insulting Eiffel in the process. 

Yorkes watches the Hernandezes tape
A couple of surprises then awaited Yorkes and the group as Molly Hernandez had managed to return to Los Angeles with a VHS tape left to her by her biological parents before they died. Yorkes and the group watched the message, and thus learned that PRIDE's actions could cause cataclysmic earthquakes in California. Yorkes comforted her adoptive sister after the reveal. They then discussed their next move and decided to infiltrate the PRIDE Construction Site to stop their parents' plan. Yorkes suggested that this meant they would not attend the dance, but Wilder actually decided to use the dance as a pretext to gather.

Yorkes and Chase Stein dancing
Therefore, as the night has arrived, Yorkes arrived for the dance and was joined by Hernandez, who noticed that Yorkes had brought her dinosaur along. Yorkes decided to go inside the building and look for Stein, which prompted Hernandez to remark on how Yorkes had put on a new dress and jewelry to draw his attention, despite Yorkes trying to deny it. Yorkes then found Stein and they began discussing about their differences and how Yorkes thought that no one, especially Stein, ever found her remarkable or attractive. As they subtly confessed their attraction to each other, they decided to share a dance before going into mission.

Yorkes and Chase Stein have sex
Going into a separate room which was to be used for a wedding celebration, Yorkes and Stein began slowly dancing. When told by Stein that he had always seen her, Yorkes admitted that she had known it. They then shared a kiss which quickly turned into passionate sex. They then left the room and stumbled on Dean and Nico Minoru, and quickly deduced that the two girls had just shared a kiss as well. The four of them then joined Wilder and Hernandez outside to reach the PRIDE Construction Site.

Yorkes and Chase Stein trying to switch off the Nemo Industrial Drilling Machine
Once they arrived, Yorkes was instructed to leave the dinosaur in the car for the time being. Having successfully entered the site, the Runaways decided to split up and Yorkes was paired with Stein in an attempt to stop the Nemo Industrial Drilling Machine. While Stein looked for a way to access the commands, Yorkes made a snarky comment about what had happened earlier between them. As Stein insisted that they had more pressing issues to be concerned with but that he recognized they had to discuss such things, Yorkes called it unimportant, stating that they were only hormones-overrun teenagers and that it was a one-night stand, leaving Stein visibly puzzled and disappointed.

Yorkes confronts the PRIDE
As Stein was able to destroy the drill's commands with the Fistigons, Yorkes and Stein joined the rest of the group with Minoru trying to fill the hole with sand with the Staff of One. However, they were stopped in their endeavors by their parents' arrival. The Runaways thus confronted PRIDE about their criminal actions, and when Stacey Yorkes insisted that both the Runaways and PRIDE belonged to the same family, Yorkes rejected that and claimed that the Runaways were a family of their own and prepared to fight PRIDE.

Yorkes and the other Runaways face Jonah and the PRIDE
During the ensuing confrontation, Yorkes was soon joined by her dinosaur, but the animal was shot with a tranquilizer by her father, causing Yorkes to rush and look after her pet companion. Yorkes and the rest of the group then had to face the powerful Jonah, and they reluctantly accepted to flee to leave only Dean behind as she was the only one able to compete with his powers. Yorkes and her friends hid elsewhere on the construction site, waiting for the fight between Jonah and Dean to be over. When things settled down, Yorkes surmised that Dean might have won, but as it turned out, they were forced to flee to escape from PRIDE without her.

Running Away
Rescue of Karolina Dean
Yorkes hiding with the Runaways
As the sun rose in the next morning, Yorkes and the rest of the Runaways wandered in the streets of Los Angeles, unsure about where to go or what to do. They decided to take shelter in the woods to hide from PRIDE and the LAPD before discussing their next move. As Nico Minoru insisted that they could not leave Karolina Dean behind, Yorkes joined the rest of her teammates and agreed to take part into a rescue mission. As the others prepared for the rescue, Yorkes went to buy some food for her dinosaur as she feared what could happen if the animal was left unfed for too long.

Yorkes speaking to Old Lace
Before returning to the Church of Gibborim Executive Office where Dean was supposedly detained, Yorkes was asked to part ways with her dinosaur, as they would draw too much attention if the Runaways were seen with the animal. Yorkes tearfully agreed and shared an emotional goodbye with her dinosaur, who she decided to call Old Lace thanks to a piece of newspaper ads formerly brought back by Alex Wilder. Yorkes then gave Old Lace instructions on how to survive in the wild and promised that she would return for her one day.

Now disguised with a green wig to replace her purple hair, Yorkes joined her teammates at the Timely Coffee to meet with Vaughn Kaye, a young member of the Church of Gibborim who the Runaways wanted to enlist in their mission. However, Kaye refused to hear them out, leaving the Runaways to work on their own to release Dean. During the mission, Yorkes and Nico Minoru worked as lookouts while Chase Stein and Molly Hernandez infiltrated the place and Wilder looked for a vehicle to escape. While they waited, Yorkes expressed her anxiety about how the Runaways would survive next. When Minoru suggested that it would be an opportunity for Yorkes to expand her relationship with Stein, Yorkes was surprised to learn that Stein actually seriously considered a relationship with her.

Yorkes and the other Runaways watch a WHiH World News report
The rescue of Dean turned out to be a success and the Runaways were able to escape and return into the woods. During the night, Yorkes slept next to Stein and they held hands while sleeping. In the next morning, as the group made their way to the Los Angeles Bus Depot, Yorkes initially remained outside the building to look out and find some food. However, upon hearing strange noises coming from a dumpster, she was thrilled to realize that Old Lace had followed her all this way. Yorkes rushed into the depot to inform her friends of this unexpected reunion, but then her attention was caught by a WHiH World News report claiming that the Runaways were wanted for the death of Destiny Gonzalez, forcing the Runaways to flee on foot rather than by bus.

Personality
Yorkes' most notable characteristic was her strong social justice warrior attitude, which she plainly embraced, displaying a zero tolerance for any form of discrimination, be it sexism, racism, homophobia or specism. She was very well known in Atlas Academy for her actions, such as promoting the use of neutral-gender bathrooms or vegan meals in the school's restaurant, but often came across her schoolmates as incredibly aggravating due to the agressivity she displayed on these subjects. She could also show insolence towards her parents, frequently making sarcastic comments to them, which they usually put up with. However, it eventually turned out that her behavior was also largely a front to mask her true feelings and her desire to be recognized, especially by Chase Stein, who she was attracted to.

Yorkes' beliefs gave her a strong moral compass she was unwilling to go against. Upon discovering that PRIDE was nothing but an organization of criminals, she kept insisting that the Runaways had to do everything to never become like their parents, and thus disapproved whenever their actions could go against morality or law. As such, when she learned that there were actually living beings in the hole of the PRIDE Construction Site, Yorkes was adamant that they had to save them instead of risking to destroy them like Alex Wilder suggested. She was also hostile to Wilder's attempt to ally with the corrupt AWOL, and felt immensely betrayed when Stein decided to leave the Runaways, claiming that she would be willing to completely forget him through the use of Synnergy Serum to forget how heartbroken she had been when her boyfriend chose to return home.

Yorkes had one major weakness: she suffered from anxiety issues which became much more troublesome when she fled from home, thus being deprived of her meds. The pain and anguish sometimes made her behaving aggressively to her friends. Yorkes' anxiety troubles could cause her to contradict herself, especially regarding her beliefs, making her a hypocrite on Yorkes' own admittance. For instance, she criticized Karolina Dean's thought that the Runaways were a family as nonsense coming from Dean's Church of Gibborim's education, thus omitting Yorkes herself had made the same statement to PRIDE during a confrontation. Yorkes' anxiety also led her to leave the Hostel to go to the hospital without telling her boyfriend Stein and her adoptive sister Molly Hernandez, causing her to be blamed for her selfishness although Yorkes claimed that she had left so that no one would get hurt because of her problems.

Gert was held prisoner by her parents, but was later rescued from the residence's basement by the Runaways.
Timely Coffee: Gert often met with the other Runaways at the Timely Coffee, where they would discuss their plans to take down PRIDE.
Hostel: Like the other Runaways, Yorkes took residence in an underground mansion known as the Hostel. She initially shared a room with her boyfriend Chase Stein, but they eventually got separated due to Yorkes briefly leaving the Hostel to go to a hospital. Yorkes returned to the Hostel, but began feeling ill due to Old Lace being poisoned, forcing Stein to take her out of the Hostel as it was being besieged. Yorkes was once again able to return to the mansion before being captured by her father.
