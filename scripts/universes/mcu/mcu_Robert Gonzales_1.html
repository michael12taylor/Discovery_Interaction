Agent Roberto "Robert" Gonzales was a high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. operative and the commanding officer of the Iliad. During the HYDRA Uprising, Gonzales and a group of loyal agents managed to save their ship from falling into HYDRA's hands. After the battle for the carrier, he assembled what was left of S.H.I.E.L.D. and reorganized it, eventually becoming one of its leaders, until another faction led by Phil Coulson emerged as well.

Distrustful of Coulson, he ordered the attack on Coulson's base, igniting the open conflict between the two S.H.I.E.L.D. factions. However, after working with Coulson to attack and destroy the Arctic HYDRA Research Facility, he agreed with Coulson to merge the two factions, successfully reunifying S.H.I.E.L.D.. He was later killed by Jiaying with a synthetic Terrigen Crystal, after attempting to negotiate with her to allow S.H.I.E.L.D. to register all Inhumans at Afterlife onto their Index to be monitored.

Biography
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Commander of the Iliad
Robert Gonzales joined S.H.I.E.L.D. when he was young working under the leadership of Nick Fury. When his wife died, Gonzales briefly left active duty, but eventually returned. Three years later, he became the Commander of the Iliad, a S.H.I.E.L.D. aircraft carrier. He eventually became one of the best commanders S.H.I.E.L.D. ever had. Gonzales and Phil Coulson encountered each other a couple of times at the Triskelion; the two impressed each other with their dedication to the work of S.H.I.E.L.D.

HYDRA Uprising
Battle on the Iliad
Gonzales defends himself against HYDRA
At the beginning of the HYDRA Uprising, Gonzales was in command of the Iliad, which was carrying dangerous cargo. A group of HYDRA agents attempted to assassinate Gonzales, but he managed to arm himself and, after a brutal gunfight, killed them all, though he was heavily injured by a hit to the kneecap with an axe. While Gonzales hid and prepared for another attack, he was eventually found by a team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents led by Bobbi Morse and Isabelle Hartley.

Gonzales is helped by Alphonso Mackenzie
While the team cared for his damaged leg, Alphonso Mackenzie told Gonzales the story of how he had once punched a wall and hurt his hand, distracting Gonzales from the agony of what Case was doing to his leg, noting that the most serious pain was the kind that could not be felt so this pain was clearly good. Once Gonzales was able to stand, Morse revealed that she had been given a secret mission by Nick Fury to detonate all the weapons on the ship, ensuring HYDRA could never get their hands on the ship's cargo, despite the fact that she would undoubtedly be killed herself as a result.

Gonzales vows to aid Bobbi Morse's mission
Gonzales refused to allow the team to waste time on this mission by getting him to a helicopter where he could escape, so he gave her new orders to allow him to join her so she could have as much help as possible to destroy the ship. Morse reluctantly agreed as she knew it was highly unlikely that she could get there alone. During their move down the corridors, they regrouped with Hartley who informed them that Victoria Hand had successfully retaken the Hub from HYDRA, with Morse noting that there was still a chance that S.H.I.E.L.D. could win this sudden and unexpected war with HYDRA.

Gonzales prepares to fight against HYDRA
When they finally reached the command center of the ship, Mackenzie attempted to talk the group into taking the ship back from HYDRA. Gonzales argued strongly against it, saying he was still the commander of the Iliad and that they would follow Fury's direct orders. However, it was agreed that with S.H.I.E.L.D. now destroyed, it was time to take control and not allow innocent agents to drown in the destruction of the ship. Gonzales and the rest of the group armed themselves and fought back against the HYDRA agents, eventually completing their new mission successfully.

Rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D.
Gonzales builds the new true S.H.I.E.L.D.
After HYDRA was pushed back, Gonzales formed a new S.H.I.E.L.D. whose values opposed Nick Fury's about secrets and lies; he recruited Bobbi Morse, Anne Weaver and Alphonso Mackenzie, among others, to his cause. When a new faction of S.H.I.E.L.D. was discovered, led by Phil Coulson, Gonzales did not trust Coulson's leadership, as he felt Coulson's ideas of running S.H.I.E.L.D. were too similar to Fury's. For the purpose of gathering intel about Coulson's leadership skills, Gonzales dispatched Isabelle Hartley, Morse and Mackenzie to join Coulson's S.H.I.E.L.D. and learn what secrets he was hiding to see this his faction should be supported by them or brought down.

S.H.I.E.L.D. Civil War
Meeting Lance Hunter
Gonzales meets Lance Hunter
Alphonso Mackenzie reported that Lance Hunter, a mercenary who had joined Phil Coulson's team, had grown suspicious of Mackenzie and Morse, so he had been captured and brought to meet Gonzales. As Hunter was a good friend of Mackenzie, the ex-husband of Bobbi Morse, and had previously gone to great lengths in a failed attempt to save Isabelle Hartley's life, Gonzales greeted him kindly, although Hunter refused to shake his hand. They were joined by Anne Weaver, Oliver and Tomas Calderon to attempt to recruit Hunter.

Gonzales has a meeting with Lance Hunter
Gonzales sat down alongside the other members of his council and explained to Hunter the origins and mentality of his new branch of S.H.I.E.L.D.; he debated with him about the strength of Coulson's leadership. Gonzales and Weaver reminded Hunter of how Coulson had seemingly gone insane due to the alien DNA now in his blood and how he was responsible for the death of their mutual friend Hartley due to his search for the Obelisk, something which also killed Antoine Triplett and caused mutations for Raina and Skye, whose new powers had proven too difficult to control and therefore had to be deemed a new dangerous threat.

Gonzales speaks to Bobbi Morse
While Hunter remained loyal to Coulson, he was able to agree with Gonzales about many of the risks involved with following Coulson; however, he insisted that Coulson was still a good man who was fighting for the right cause. They were later joined by Morse who continued to side with Gonzales' views. Once the meeting was concluded, Gonzales ordered Mackenzie to return to the Playground and spoke with Morse about her relationship with Hunter and if this was taking her focus off mission. Morse insisted it was not and Gonzales revealed he would keep Hunter on the ship.

Gonzales discusses Lance Hunter's escape
Later, Gonzales learned that Hunter had escaped from the Iliad, with little resistance from Morse. He called an emergency meeting with his council; they discussed how much time they would have to apprehend Hunter, who was likely heading back to the Playground to inform Coulson of their plans. Calderon made his own frustration clear as he yelled at Morse. Gonzales sent Morse and Mackenzie back to the Playground to continue their mission, retrieve Fury's Toolbox and gain Gonzales and his team entry into the base so Gonzales could finally confront Coulson.

Conversation with Phil Coulson
Gonzales is updated by Bobbi Morse
Gonzales and his agents began preparing to attack the Playground, as Bobbi Morse informed Gonzales and Tomas Calderon that it was time to strike the base thanks to a hidden computer in the Playground used to contact the Iliad. She informed them that her cover had been blown before asking if they had found Lance Hunter, although Gonzales did explain that they were still tracking him while Calderon asked Morse about finding Skye's top secret location.

Gonzales breaks into the Playground
While Morse attempted to get away with the Toolbox, she was hunted down by her former allies. Meanwhile, Gonzales stormed through a hole blown in the side of the base and used his soldiers to capture Coulson's team, he also ensured that the base was filled with gas to knock out the rival agents. Once inside, Gonzales found Alphonso Mackenzie lying under a pile of rubble after he had been injured in the explosion while trying to save Leo Fitz from the blast. Gonzales ensured Mackenzie got immediate medical attention before exploring the base with Calderon and their team of agents.

Gonzales and Bobbi Morse discuss Coulson
Once the base was captured and all of Coulson's team had been apprehended with the exception of Melinda May, Gonzales spoke to Morse promising that if Phil Coulson was as good a man as she said he was, then he would surely understand. Anne Weaver then arrived and informed the group of Mackenzie was going to be okay while Calderon confirmed that Skye was at the Retreat before requesting a team of agents to capture her with Morse insisting on coming as well to be a familiar face for Skye. Gonzales agreed and Weaver left to update agent Oliver on their current mission status.

Gonzales meets and questions Phil Coulson
While Calderon and Morse to a squad of Quinjets to the Retreat to find and capture Skye, Gonzales called for Coulson to be brought to him. In Coulson's office, Gonzales greeted Coulson and they exchanged pleasantries for a short period. Coulson then revealed that he knew exactly who Gonzales was and his history with working for S.H.I.E.L.D., even revealing that he had intended for Gonzales to join his team. Gonzales explained his own knowledge of Coulson, expressing his concerns over Coulson's recovery with the help of alien blood and Skye's new powers. Gonzales revealed that he needed Coulson to show him how to open the Toolbox.

Gonzales asks Coulson to open the Toolbox
Coulson refused to help and to try and change his mind, Gonzales expressed his hatred for the way Nick Fury had run S.H.I.E.L.D., reminding Coulson that Project Insight was Fury's idea, and how he had made Coulson his heir with the same views. Seeing Coulson would not cooperate, Gonzales handed the Toolbox over to a guard and ordered him to deliver it to Anne Weaver and Jemma Simmons. Before Gonzales could react, Melinda May stormed into the office and took over Gonzales' soldiers before shooting him with an I.C.E.R.. When he awoke, he learned that May had helped Coulson escape before being captured herself by Weaver's team.

Accessing the Toolbox
Gonzales and Bobbi Morse discuss Skye
When Bobbi Morse returned from her failed mission to apprehend Skye, Gonzales questioned her about the events which had resulted in seven agents being injured and Tomas Calderon in critical condition after Skye lost control, moments before being rescued by a mysterious teleporter. Furious about the disaster, Gonzales referred to Skye as a thing only for Morse to argue that she was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who had defended herself when Calderon fired.

Gonzales argues with Bobbi Morse
Although Morse defended her actions, Gonzales argued that Skye's powers had simply become too dangerous, proving his theories about dangers involved with Coulson's obsession with gathering people with powers, he began to suspect that Phil Coulson was making a team of powered people and questioned if the teleporter was part of this team of Coulson's, although Morse insisted that Coulson was in the dark about them. Believing that the powered people were a major risk to the safety of the world, Gonzales told Morse that they had to avoid an open war at all costs by finally finding Coulson.

Gonzales meets agents Fitz and Simmons
With Morse by his side, Gonzales personally approached Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons and offered an introductory handshake as he relayed to them how he desired to recruit them from the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy to be his field agents but Coulson had beaten him to it by bribing Anne Weaver. Gonzales asked Fitz to open the Toolbox, but Simmons told him that under different circumstances, they would be flattered; she wanted to know the repercussions if he refused to do as instructed, noting that Melinda May had been locked away in the vault though Gonzales denied she was his prisoner.

Gonzales looks at the Toolbox
Morse explained that Coulson and Nick Fury believed whatever was inside the Toolbox needed to be protected before explaining that the "Exit Protocols" were still in effect; if they did not want to cooperate, they could leave. Gonzales and Morse frowned as Fitz chose non-compliance and went to pack up his things while Simmons mocking recommended that Gonzales should have bribed them with cupcakes. Though Morse admired FitzSimmons' loyalty, Gonzales believed that their loyalty to Coulson over S.H.I.E.L.D. made them as dangerous as whatever secrets were hidden inside the Toolbox.

Recruiting Melinda May
Gonzales questions Melinda May
With Melinda May now captured and locked up in Vault D, Gonzales questioned her about Phil Coulson's history of leadership. Gonzales asked her if the reports were true that Nick Fury had ordered her to spy on Coulson due to him being injected with GH.325, and if it were true that Coulson had ordered her to kill him if he lost control of his mind. Gonzales also asked her if she was loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D. or to Coulson, she instead told him they were one and the same. Gonzales reminded her of the dangers of powered people, citing Skye's recent attack and May's experiences in Bahrain. He tried to convince her to help them find Coulson before some deadly shootout occurred; May assured Gonzales that when he was ready, Coulson would find him.

Gonzales hunts down Phil Coulson
The next day, Gonzales sent a team of agents back to the Retreat upon receiving a signal from there. Once they confirmed that Coulson and Lance Hunter were inside the cabin, Gonzales informed Bobbi Morse, who suspected that Coulson had lured them there. Gonzales later learned that Coulson had allied himself with Hunter and Deathlok and had commandeered one of their Quinjets. This served to validate Gonzales' theory that Coulson was recruiting powered people and was concerned that once they found Skye, they would be headed for an inevitable explosive confrontation against them.

Gonzales offers Melinda May his own gun
With the vote of his council telling him to try another approach with May, Gonzales flew her to the Iliad and took her to the boardroom. Once there, Gonzales drew a gun and explained it was his father's, who had used it during World War II. He gave it to her, telling her that she could kill him if she really believed he was a traitor like he was being accused of. May took the gun and pointed it at Gonzales, but did not pull the trigger, allowing Gonzales a chance to explain his intentions. Gonzales told May he believed S.H.I.E.L.D. needed a strong foundation to keep from falling apart again.

Gonzales proves himself to Melinda May
Gonzales explained that he was offering May a place on his board of directors, claiming that he would find Coulson and when he did, Coulson would need defense from someone who knew him better than most. Considering what he said, May handed him back his gun, believing it to be empty; Gonzales then proved that it was in fact fully loaded the entire time they were speaking. Gonzales made it clear that if his and Coulson's branches of S.H.I.E.L.D. remained enemies fighting against each other, then HYDRA would take advantage and destroy them, something he would not allow.

Working with Coulson
Deal for the Toolbox
Gonzales is given the Toolbox
After Phil Coulson chose to surrender to Bobbi Morse and Alphonso Mackenzie, he was taken to the Bus to meet with Gonzales. When Gonzales spoke to Coulson, he immediately wished to know why Coulson had decided to surrender, he revealed that Wolfgang von Strucker and List had a secret base where they were experimenting on enhanced people, and had kidnapped Deathlok and another enhanced individual. Gonzales asked why he should trust him and Coulson said it was because they both had secrets, saying he knew that Gonzales had a secret hidden in his cargo hold, which he had learned of from the Toolbox, Coulson promised to open the Toolbox in exchange for his assistance.

Gonzales greets Grant Ward and Agent 33
Coulson and Gonzales began debating how best to attack the base, Gonzales suggested that they simply destroy it with an airstrike as he was unwilling to risk his own team members, Coulson assured him that he was planning on using his own team, which would include Grant Ward who had ties to List and von Strucker. Which Gonzales' permission, Ward landed the Quinjet on the Bus and they traveled back to the Playground where Gonzales immediately informed Ward and Agent 33 that they would have armed guards around them at all times.

Gonzales calls for a vote on the mission
Having watched the video feed from Deathlok's eyepiece showing him being tortured by the HYDRA scientists, Ward revealed that he had Sunil Bakshi working undercover for them. Coulson explained his plan was to use a small team to attack the base and rescue their allies, Gonzales put the matter to a vote, with both Anne Weaver and Oliver voting against the idea as they both believed it was too much of a risk and an airstrike was the better move, but Gonzales, Ward, Coulson, Bobbi Morse and Melinda May voted to move forward and the mission was put into action now under Coulson's leadership.

Attacking HYDRA
Gonzales orders Bobbi Morse to stay behind
Gonzales spoke to Bobbi Morse after the vote and ordered her not to go on the mission herself and instead to allow Phil Coulson to use only his people for the mission. Morse, however, argued that there were S.H.I.E.L.D. agents going on the mission should have backup, but Gonzales argued that as HYDRA showed no weakness, they should not either, much to the dismay of Morse who wanted to support Coulson's mission to rescue the hostages from HYDRA.

Gonzales watches the mission unfolding
Gonzales and his people watched the mission unfolding from within the Playground as Coulson and his own team allowed the Bus to be destroyed as a distraction to get themselves inside without being seen. Once inside the Arctic HYDRA Research Facility, Coulson's team was able to rescue Mike Peterson as well as Lincoln Campbell, although Sunil Bakshi was killed and as a result Grant Ward left the team. List also escaped during the chaos in order to regroup with Wolfgang von Strucker. Once Coulson's team was clear, Gonzales gave the order to destroy the entire base.

Gonzales and Bobbi Morse discuss Inhumans
With the mission now a success, Gonzales watched as Skye sat by Lincoln Campbell's bedside before being updated on the destruction of the HYDRA base by Bobbi Morse. Gonzales told Morse about the dangers that Skye still posed to them, as he believed her powers could not be controlled. Gonzales revealed that he had allowed the mission to go ahead as he wished to have enhanced people on the base to be studied. Morse questioned the morals in Gonzales' ideas while he claimed that the Inhumans needed to be understood so they could learn how many were out there in the world.

Gonzales learns that Nick Fury is alive
As they were speaking, Coulson appeared and Gonzales told him to honor their agreement to open the Toolbox for him to study, which Coulson gladly did without any hesitation in order to allow Gonzales access to all of the S.H.I.E.L.D. he wanted to understand, making a brief reference to the fact that Nick Fury was in fact still alive and might ask for it back at some stage. Before Gonzales could react to this news, Coulson received a call from Maria Hill and left, leaving Gonzales in a state of shock from the fact that Fury was alive.

The Inhuman Threat
Gonzales admits Coulson was right
After the Avengers defeated Ultron, and saved thousands of lives during the Battle of Sokovia with the help of a Helicarrier provided to Nick Fury by Phil Coulson, Gonzales called a meeting with Coulson onboard the Iliad to discuss these events. They watched the battle on the WHiH World News, Coulson told them the story behind Theta Protocol. Coulson called for them to join forces as one S.H.I.E.L.D. with him as director and Gonzales' colleagues as advisors.

Gonzales and Coulson see the Inhumans
Shortly after the talk, the alarms were set off when Lance Hunter saw that the teleporter and Raina had broken onto the ship. Gonzales and Coulson then set about tracking them and soon discovered they were attempting to locate the Monolith that was hidden in the cargo hold. Although the pair escaped the ship before stealing the stone, Gonzales was furious at the infiltration. At a debrief meeting with Coulson and the heads of S.H.I.E.L.D., Gonzales told what he knew about the stone; Coulson explained that the Toolbox only stated that HYDRA was interested in it and they discussed their new enemy.

Gonzales successfully tracks down Gordon
Under the orders of Gonzales, Anne Weaver and Oliver were able to use the technology used by HYDRA for tracking down the mysterious teleporter, and with it was able to get a read on his current location by using a scan from inside Deathlok's Backscatter X-Ray Eye Implant and had been able to follow his signature from when he and Raina had left the Iliad. When Bobbi Morse arrived to confirm that the Monolith was safe, Gonzales, Weaver and Oliver informed her of this new development and Gonzales suggested that it was time to pay the Inhumans a visit to learn their intentions.

Making a Plan
Gonzales discusses meeting the Inhumans
Back at the Playground, Gonzales and the rest of S.H.I.E.L.D. began discussing their next move, Gonzales wishing to move in for an attack of the Inhumans' base. While Oliver and Anne Weaver suggested the different ways the Inhumans could attack them, Phil Coulson insisted that they should not start a war and suggested a sit down with Jiaying, the Inhumans' leader in order to settle their differences peacefully, using Skye as a go between for both sides.

Gonzales tells Coulson not to meet Jiaying
Later, when they were discussing the mission plan to send various teams to Afterlife onboard their squad of Quinjets, Gonzales insisted that Coulson should not be the one to go, as he had too close a connection to the people involved. When Coulson argued, Gonzales used Tony Stark as an example of what happens when one man goes unquestioned, as that had led to the Avengers inadvertently creating their own enemy in Ultron and almost destroying the whole world. The matter was put to a vote and it was decided that Gonzales should instead be the one to go in Coulson's place.

Meeting in Afterlife
Gonzales is given a gift from Anne Weaver
As the teams approached the Inhumans' home of Afterlife onboard their Quinjet, Gonzales was given an insurance policy from Anne Weaver of a necklace that was found in the wreckage of Jiaying's home years before when Daniel Whitehall had stolen it. Gonzales was then informed by Melinda May that they were coming close to arriving. As they got closer, they saw the base had more residents than they had expected, Gonzales insisted they still move forward with the mission regardless.

Gonzales meets both Jiaying and Calvin Zabo
When they touched down on the ground, they were greeted by Gordon and Gonzales was taken to Jiaying's office. Once Gonzales arrived in the office, Skye demanded to know why Phil Coulson had not come and Gonzales reassured her that there was nothing to be concerned about and promised that he had come with the same intentions, he then asked why Calvin Zabo was present and Jiaying explained that as Skye and Lincoln Campbell had been returned to them, they were willing to return Zabo to S.H.I.E.L.D. as a peace gesture before they began speaking.

Gonzales has a peace meeting with Jiaying
While Skye was sent to drop Zabo off at the Quinjet to be taken back to the Playground, Gonzales and Jiaying began their meeting. As they sat down, Gonzales noted that he had heard all the stories of what HYDRA and Daniel Whitehall had done to Jiaying and compared his own injuries to his leg, which he had gained during the Battle on the Iliad to hers. As a gesture of good faith and to prove that there was a key difference between S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA, Gonzales gave Jiaying the necklace that had been recovered from Whitehall's office after Coulson had killed him, with Jiaying explaining that she had always intended to give it to her own daughter.

Gonzales learns the history of the Inhumans
Gonzales told Jiaying about S.H.I.E.L.D.'s past history with enhanced people, and explained they were there to protect innocent people when bad people gained powers. He told her he wished to meet her people and make a record of their powers so they could be there if they ever tried to do people harm. Jiaying offered Gonzales a gift, as she began explaining that over her long life she had seen countless people put into categories to be tracked and controlled because of their fear. Jiaying explained that her own fear of having her Diviners destroyed led to her building new Terrigen Crystals.

Gonzales gets attacked with the Terrigen Mist
Gonzales was then informed by Jiaying that although they had been successful with replicating Terrigen Crystals, the Crystals were now laced with the Diviner metal making them deadly to Humans. She then smashed the crystal on the table causing the Terrigen Mist to wash over Gonzales, with Jiaying noting that he should hope to be an Inhuman as it would be his only hope. While Jiaying watched with a sadistic pleasure, Gonzales felt his body beginning to petrify due to him not being an Inhuman and protected from the mist.

Gonzales' body is turned to stone as he dies
Gonzales pulled out his gun as Jiaying told him that his scars were nothing like hers and she would never allow any of her own people to experience what she had when Whitehall had ripped her body apart due to his fear and need to understand the power of Inhumans. Gonzales desperately tried to tell Jiaying that by doing this she would get everybody killed, but before he could finish his sentence, his body had turned to stone, killing him. With Gonzales dead, Jiaying ripped his gun from him, causing his hand to shatter while she proceeded to use the gun to shoot herself twice through the shoulder.

Legacy
Stopping Jiaying
Jiaying pretended that Gonzales had tried to shoot her and therefore that S.H.I.E.L.D. had declared war against the Inhumans. This convinced Skye, who was present at Afterlife during the meeting, to side with her mother and to turn on S.H.I.E.L.D. Jiaying then had her men destroy the building where she had met Gonzalez with a stolen Quinjet to conceal all evidence that Gonzales had been ambushed.

The death of Gonzalez understandably deeply infuriated S.H.I.E.L.D., who could not believe that Gonzales could have been foolish enough to attack Jiaying. Anne Weaver suggested an immediate response to this declaration of open war from Jiaying. However, Alphonso Mackenzie decided to collect more information about the Inhumans before striking them. Eventually, Gonzales' death was avenged when S.H.I.E.L.D. defeated the Afterlife Inhumans and Calvin Zabo killed Jiaying.

Personality
According to Phil Coulson, Gonzales was someone who dedicated his life to S.H.I.E.L.D. This was proven by his actions to make sure the organization stands tall no matter the action. Combined with his tactical skills, this makes him a great asset to S.H.I.E.L.D. However, Gonzales was quite hypocritical and short-sighted; as he blames Nick Fury and Project Insight entirely for the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D., somewhat forgetting that HYDRA's infiltration was what caused it in the first place, he also points out how S.H.I.E.L.D. should not stand divided, despite his own refusal to cooperate with Coulson. Noticeably, Gonzales constantly refers to Skye as an "it" due to her new-found status as an Inhuman. Despite believing himself to be objective about Skye, he blamed her for injuring several agents, even though she was only defending herself from Calderon.

Gonzales also calls Coulson untrustworthy for acting like a fugitive, when he himself made Coulson a fugitive in the first place. Also, while he stated that he believed in the transparency of S.H.I.E.L.D., Gonzales himself had secrets and had practiced deception, as evidenced by his keeping the existence of the cargo on his ship a secret as well as putting moles in the Playground to spy on Coulson and gather intelligence. Even after agreeing to work with Coulson to attack HYDRA, he pulled Bobbi Morse from the mission because he didn't want to risk any of his people, viewing Coulson and his team as an acceptable sacrifice, describing it as "for the greater good".

On the other hand, Gonzales' actions could be somewhat excused by his experiences since the HYDRA Uprising. He was suspicious toward everyone outside of his S.H.I.E.L.D. faction because he believed he could only trust the people who fought against HYDRA by his side. Since HYDRA had deeply infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D., the World Security Council, and the Government, Gonzales' behavior is understandable. He was overcautious because HYDRA's spies are everywhere, he was distrustful of enhanced people because one of them was used by HYDRA against S.H.I.E.L.D. at the Battle at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy, and he believed that Coulson's judgement was clouded by the serum made from the alien blood that brought Coulson back from the dead.

Gonzales also had a sense of entitlement; in his insistence that his S.H.I.E.L.D. faction is the "real" S.H.I.E.L.D., he expected Coulson's S.H.I.E.L.D. to show him courtesies that he himself hypocritically refused to show them. Furthermore, he painted Coulson's loyalists as betraying S.H.I.E.L.D., though he did accept Melinda May as a member of his board. When he tried to recruit Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons for his cause, he openly said:"We are all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents", wanting to put the differences behind. Despite his flaws, he would still obey orders given to him by a legitimate source, even if he disagrees with them.

However, Gonzales would learn to work with Coulson, as evidenced by his acceptance of the merging of both S.H.I.E.L.D.s and placing Coulson as Director again. He genuinely believed in achieving peace with the Inhumans after the end of conflicts with HYDRA, and agreed to propose a diplomatic mission between S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Inhumans of Afterlife, though he would die before that peace could be achieved.

Abilities
Expert Tactician: Gonzales planned and succeeded in conquering the Playground, causing Phil Coulson to flee. Coulson himself credited Gonzales for his brilliance.
Equipment
Weapons
Colt M1911A1: Gonzales kept a Colt M1911A1 that belonged to his father, who used it during World War II. He used it to kill many HYDRA operatives and retake the Iliad from HYDRA when they revealed its presence within S.H.I.E.L.D.. Gonzales also told Melinda May that the gun was said to find the right target at the right time, and handed it to her in order to let May shoot him if she honestly believed he was a traitor to S.H.I.E.L.D..
M4A1: Gonzales wielded a M4A1 while defending his position at the Iliad from HYDRA operatives, when the organization revealed its presence within S.H.I.E.L.D. He used the weapon to aim at whoever approached him, so he aimed at Bobbi Morse believing her to be another HYDRA operative, until she identified her as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent beyond all doubt.
Smith & Wesson M&P Two Tone variant: Gonzales carried a Smith & Wesson M&P Two Tone variant as his personal sidearm to Afterlife, despite he was supposed to go unarmed. He tried to use it when the negotiations turned up to be a trap set up by Jiaying, but he was unable to use it as he was being petrified by the mist from a tainted Terrigen Crystal.
Other Equipment
Toolbox: To be added
Vehicles
Quinjet: Onboard the Iliad, there were about a dozen Quinjets on the deck. They were used for extractions, assaults, landings, drops, to name a few. Gonzalez favored them over Phil Coulson's Bus, saying it was too "over the top."
Facilities
Iliad: The Iliad is a S.H.I.E.L.D. aircraft carrier, operated by Gonzalez's faction of S.H.I.E.L.D. until the merge with Phil Coulson's S.H.I.E.L.D.. It was taken over by Jiaying during her campaign to destroy S.H.I.E.L.D..
Playground: Although he initially ran his faction of S.H.I.E.L.D. from the Iliad, Gonzales later managed to take over the Playground from which Phil Coulson's S.H.I.E.L.D. operated. Gonzales and his men turned the base into theirs, causing the departure of several agents like Coulson, Lance Hunter or Leo Fitz. Gonzales ran operations from the Playground, attempting to recapture Coulson to discover the secrets of the Toolbox. Later, as Coulson returned and offered to merge both their factions, Gonzales accepted and remained in the Playground to serve as one of Coulson's main advisors. He later left the Playground for the Inhuman settlement of Afterlife, where he would meet his death.
