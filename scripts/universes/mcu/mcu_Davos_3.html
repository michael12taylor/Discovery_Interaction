<html><p>Davos then made his way up the stairs until he had reached Wong's apartment, where he used the Iron Fist to smash down the door and searched for his targets inside. However, Davos soon found that the apartment was empty, as Danny Rand and Colleen Wing had beaten him there and helped Yang to escape, finding that the tea was still hot, indicating that they had not been gone from the apartment for long. Unwilling to allow the leader of the Yangsi Gonshi to escape without facing his wrath, Davos gave chase, finding Wing fighting Wu before she had then successfully escaped with Rand and Yang.

Davos furiously confronting Chen Wu
Although Davos lit up the Iron Fist to try and strike at the car, he was just too late as the car sped away with his targets inside, as Davos and Rand made eye contact while they disappeared into New York City. Furiously that he lost his chance to kill the leader of the Yangsi Gonshi and the widow of Hai-Qing Yang, Davos furiously confronted Wu over how this could have happened, questioning if Wu betrayed him, to which noted how Yang took his eye during their last meeting. As Davos demanded to know how this happened, Wu then spotted a poster featuring his own car and asking for any information.

Attempting to Rebrand
Davos questioning Joy Meachum's motives
Returning to Eden Towers, Davos had found Joy Meachum snooping around and questioned why she had agreed to come with him on their mission together. Meachum claimed that she simply wanted to change and become a better person, to which Davos noted how she had previously been afraid of him before she changed her mind, questioning what had changed for her, although Meachum questioned if this really mattered which Davos had insisted it did for him to better understand her.

Davos and Joy Meachum walking together
Davos continued questioning why Meachum would follow him if she had ever been afraid of him, to which Meachum had simply claimed that she knew Davos needed her just as much as she needed him, as she invited Davos to walk with her. Going past Ryhno's Gang as they had trained, Meachum commented on how Chen Wu was listening to her before noting how the facility was going to be converted by Rand Enterprises before they had bought it to become their new hideout, as Davos then questioned where Meachum was going with this line of thought, pushing Meachum to get to her point quickly.

Davos expresses hate at being called a killer
Meachum explained how, despite his hard exterior, she knew Davos was a good and noble man, which was why she accepted his violent methods for achieving his goals. Meachum then showed Davos the posters of Wu's car which Danny Rand and Colleen Wing had put up, as Davos noted how they portrayed him to be the murderer, despite what he saw as necessary sacrifices for the greater good. Meachum suggested that Davos do more for New York City than killing people, promising that this would help get the people of the city on his side, as Davos had reluctantly accepted that Meachum was right.

Davos and Chen Wu both preparing to leave
Seeking to do some good, Davos prepared to leave the Towers and told Ryhno's Gang to come with them, much to Wu's surprise while Davos had told him that only the Gang were coming while Wu would arrange transportation. BB however told Ryhno that he did not want to go, claiming that he felt unwell, as Davos and Wu watched from the side as Ryhno punched BB in the stomach and ordered his fellow gang members to then throw BB into the dark room as punishment for disobeying Davos' direct orders, as the rest of the gang followed closely behind Davos, much to his own great satisfaction.

Assassination of Henry Yip
Davos and Ryhno's Gang greeting Henry Yip
Taking Ryhno's Gang along with him, Davos went out into New York City to try and do some good, as he demanded that the Gang make up for some of their past crimes, going to the Silver Lotus to personally apologize to Henry Yip for their previous threats and attacks against him. Yip initially promised to pay Davos despite the Golden Tigers being defeated, to which Davos insisted he did not want Yip's money, as the waitress knew Davos had ended the Triad War.

Davos being angered by Henry Yip's reaction
Davos then had Ryhno step up and bow down to Yip, before he then personally apologized for how he and his gang had treated Yang and his staff, much to Yip's confusion. Davos then informed Yip that he would be provided protection for him without any charge, claiming that all he wanted in return for this protection being provided to him, was for Yip to still be a good man, seeking out justice and rejecting corruption. Seeing the fear in Yip's eyes, Davos questioned if he had a problem with what was being offered, to which Yip claimed that he simply wanted to stay out all any business involving criminals.

Davos brutally murders the innocent Henry Yip
This commented offended Davos considerably as he questioned if Yip did not believe he was a good man. When Yip claimed that he simply did not want to take sides against either the Tigers or the Yangsi Gonshi, Davos took this to mean that Yip was still in league with the Tigers, which was why he had rejected Davos' offer as he wanted to continue serving the Tigers. While Yip had desperately attempted to defend himself, Davos furiously pushed him against the wall and lit up the Iron Fist, before punching straight through Yip's stomach, killing him as blood covered Davos' clenched fist.

Davos ensures his followers all remain loyal
Davos then told his followers that Yip was part of cancer that had plagued New York, to which Ryhno claimed that Yip had been telling the truth and was never in league with the Tigers, then claiming that Davos had just murdered an innocent man. As Ryhno had then tried to claim that BB was right about Davos, Crank then stepped up and slit Ryhno's throat, killing him and dropping his corpse down into the rubbish, while Crank recited the teachings of the Order of the Crane Mother to show his loyalty. Davos then confirmed that the others did not doubt his teachings before they left all the bodies behind.

Anger at Meachum
Davos becoming angrier at Joy Meachum
Returning to the Eden Towers, Davos found Joy Meachum was still there as he furiously claimed that he should have never listened to Meachum's suggestion about how to change his image in the eyes of the people of New York City. Meachum however stopped Davos in his tracks and insisted that he not shut her out of the situation as she was still a part of their overall plans, only for Davos to angrily claim that he did not believe in Meachum's technics in finding a way toward peace anymore and had realized only violence would actually change the city for the better.

Davos commenting on Meachum's upbringing
While Meachum tried to convince Davos to stay and talk about what exactly had just happened to make him this angry, Davos raised his hand, which still had Henry Yip's blood on it, and claimed that only deaf ears and unruly children would be there to listen to his message and therefore he must bring New York to heal. Davos then claimed that the reason the children of the Order of the Crane Mother were beaten back at K'un-Lun was to break them all down emotionally and physically, until they finally submitted and accepted the truth within their hearts, a statement which clearly unnerved Meachum.

Davos calmly questions Joy Meachum himself
Davos later realized that the Tibetan Singing Bowl had been stolen from him, as Davos had immediately suspected that Meachum was involved, have also discovered that BB had escaped from his cell and only Meachum could have let him out. Davos demanded that Meachum be honest with him over what had happened, although she insisted that she had done nothing wrong, noting that it was only through her that Davos had gotten the Bowl from Mika Prada and it seemed unlikely that she would recruit the aid of a young boy to steal it from Davos, although he had still remained unconvinced.

Davos calmly threatens Joy Meachum's life
Davos then noted that he had the power to crush Meachum's life out of her with his bare hands, vowing that if she did not tell him the truth then he would take his time in beating her to death. With this threat, Meachum claimed she had sent BB to the FBI and he was giving up their location, as Meachum suggested Davos and Chen Wu go make their escape while they still could. While Wu had suggested that they should burn down the facility and run, Davos insisted that Meachum was lying, claiming that Danny Rand had put Meachum up to this to steal the Iron Fist back, as he could not accept his own failure.

Davos accusing Joy Meachum of lying to him
As Meachum insisted that Rand did not know that she was there, she had told Davos that he had lost his mind and needed to be stopped, noting that Davos never earned the right to the Iron Fist and was therefore no better than the criminals he was slaughtering. Meachum then claimed that any adult, apart from Wu, could see right through Davos' bullshit. While Davos claimed that despite her strong words, Meachum was still scared of him, Crank arrived and informed him that BB was at Bayard Community Center with the Bowl, noting that BB had just made the mistake of calling him to explain this.

Davos pushes Joy Meachum off the balcony
Davos then made plans to go capture BB and take back their Bowl, but Crank noted that the Golden Tigers and Yangsi Gonshi were both there waiting for a chance to make an assassination attempt on him. Davos then commented that he would thank BB for bringing him to his enemies' location before killing him. Davos then told Meachum she had a failure of vision, while she told him that he had nobody left, as his family was gone and he brutalized his best friend, questioning if he really wanted her dead. Davos responded by pushing Meachum off the balcony, uncaring if she had lived or died from the fall.

Confronted by Danny Rand
Davos finally finds and confronts Sherry Yang
Arriving at the Bayard Community Center, Davos then had all of the remaining members of Ryhno's Gang blocking the exit while he had entered the building. Stepping inside the kitchen, Davos immediately encountered the Yangsi Gonshi attempting to get Sherry Yang and the innocent civilians out of harm's way. Telling Yang to head upstairs, Liu chose to face Davos alone, closing the door behind him as the enemies had then prepared to face off against each other.

Davos furiously fights and overpowers Liu
As Davos clenched his still bloodied fists, Liu removed his jacket and drew his twin hatchets, before charging at Davos in a furious attempt to kill him. Despite Liu's clear fighting abilities, Davos' own speed and training by the Order of the Crane Mother had given him a clear advantage in their duel as he was able to avoid all Liu's many furious strikes and push Liu away from him, quickly managed to throw one of Liu's hatchets away. Davos then immediately disarmed Liu and had then painfully kicked him right across the room, before taking his hatchet and throwing it into Liu's chest, mortally wounding him.

Davos completely destroys Liu's entire skull
With Liu now in considerable pain and unable to defend himself due to the fatal wound, Davos calmly stepped over to his enemy and looked him straight in the eye while lighting up the Iron Fist. Without a word, Davos punched Liu across the face with such force that he completely removed Liu's head from his body, splattering blood across the walls. With the Yangsi Gonshi's security chief and main defense now lying dead at his feet, Davos turned around and calmly followed after Yang and the other Triad members who were still alive, seeking to end the Triad War once and for all by killing Yang.

Davos finds Danny Rand standing in his way
Stepping into the main hall of the building, Davos had found that the only person now standing in his way was Danny Rand, who was still limping following their last encounter. Davos noted how surprised he had been when he had previously seen Rand standing back up again when he had rescued Yang, as Davos claimed that while it gave him no pleasure to have crippled Rand, he would do worse if he stood in his way. Davos said he was there for the Tibetan Singing Bowl and to kill Yang once and for all, threatening to slaughter the innocent lives there just to get to Yang as he demanded to Rand move aside.

Davos has another fight against Danny Rand
Rand confessed to Davos that if he could, then he would change his decision to leave K'un-Lun to return to New York City, apologizing to Davos for the pain this had caused him, while Davos insisted that he should have never been given the Iron Fist, but Rand claimed that Davos should not either. Kicking him across the room, Rand started a fight between them as he questioned why Lei Kung had ever ended the Duel of K'un-Lun in Rand's favor, while Davos claimed it did not matter, as Kung was now dead, which he blamed Rand for, as Davos had furiously fought back and almost hit Rand with the Iron Fist.

Davos gains the upper hand over Danny Rand
When Davos tried to land another fatal blow with the Iron Fist, Rand was able to block the strike as he pushed Davos away from him, as he questioned if Kung was trying to spare Davos' pride or if he knew what kind of monster Davos would become with the Fist. Ignoring this, Davos attacked Rand again, who was able to land several hits on Davos' face before Davos managed to land a kick against Rand. With Rand down on the ground, he claimed that he had attempted to get through to Davos but had now been left with no other choice as he then got straight back up to continue fighting against Davos.

Davos being injected with another tranquilizer
Rand then revealed that he was armed with a tranquilizer like he had used with Mary Walker to subdue Davos previously, as Davos did everything in his power to then keep Rand from injecting him with it. However, when Davos managed to knock it out of Rand's hand, he still managed to catch it and plunged the needle into Davos' chest. However this only enraged Davos even more as he began furiously throwing punches at Rand, only for the effects of the tranquilizer to cause him to lose focus and power in his punches, as Rand was able to easily keep Davos at bay while he had tried to keep himself awake and focused in order to then still continue fighting against Rand.

Davos being finally subdued by Danny Rand
Barely able to stand any more, Davos could do nothing to stop Rand from blocking his next punch as he was then put in a tight headlock and forced down onto the ground until despite fighting with every bit of strength he had left, Davos was put to sleep by the chock hold, leaving Rand victorious over Davos once again. While the New York City Police Department arrived on the scene to arrest Ryhno's Gang who had also been defeated, Detective Misty Knight agreed to assist Rand and Colleen Wing with then secretly taking Davos' unconscious body back into Chikara Dojo rather than having him arrested.

The Transference Ceremony
Davos' blood is drawn by the Crane Sisters
With Davos unconscious, he was taken to Chikara Dojo before being handcuffed to a pillar as the Crane Sisters gathered and prepared to conduct the same ceremony to steal the power of the Iron Fist. While Davos slept, his blood was drawn by Avalon and combined with Danny Rand's Mark of Shou-Lao to create the mixture for the tattoo for Colleen Wing. Once the tattoo was complete, the Crane Sisters departed, leaving Rand and Wing ready to begin the ceremony on the unconscious Davos who was unaware of what was happening.

Davos awakes to the Transference Ceremony
Davos, however, was suddenly woken up once their ceremony took place and Wing used a technic of the Order of the Crane Mother to attempt to rip the power of the Iron Fist away from Davos, causing their eyes to light up green and Davos felt all the power being stolen, causing both Davos and Wing incredible pain. Unwilling to allow the power he had sought his entire life to take away from him, Davos had summoned the Iron Fist into both of his fists and then smashed down on the ground, which caused a massive shockwave which knocked Rand and Wing away from him and caused considerable damage.

Davos watches Colleen Wing use the Iron Fist
As Davos got onto his feet, Rand saw his former friend as a potential enemy due to how angry he was at having the Iron Fist almost taken away from him, as Rand then drew Wing's Katana in order to keep him at bay, as Davos still insisted that Rand had failed once again. However, to Davos' horror, he discovered the ceremony was partially successful, as Wing had gained the Iron Fist. Davos and Wing also discovered that failing to complete the ceremony in its entirety was causing them both intense pain, as the power of half transferred Chi was now burning uncontrollably through both their bodies.

Davos still refuses to surrender the Iron Fist
As Davos questioned why Rand would even consider giving the Iron Fist to a former member of the Hand, Rand had insisted Davos must allow them to complete the ceremony before it had killed them both. Davos, however, refused, furiously declaring that the Iron Fist was his alone, as he once again gathered his power into his fist and smashed down on the ground with all of his might, managing to create another massive shockwave. While Rand and Wing were recovering from the shockwave which had caused even more damage to the dojo, Davos had then managed to make his hasty escape from the dojo.

Battle at Eden Towers
Davos calls out to Chen Wu for assistance
Returning back to Eden Towers, Davos stormed inside and called out to Chen Wu, noting that Wu would finally have his chance to prove his worth to him as Danny Rand and Colleen Wing were currently on their way to his location. However, as Davos had called out to Wu that they must prepare for Rand and Wing's arrival, he then saw a pool of blood on the floor as he realized something had gone terribly wrong. Sensing some kind of incoming danger, Davos had then charged behind a pillar, barely avoiding a gunshot fired at him.

Davos being forced to hide from Mary Walker
Seeking to get behind some better cover, Davos charged across the room as fast as he could, avoiding several more gunshots before he managed to get behind a brick wall. While more gunshots struck his cover, Davos heard Mary Walker mockingly calling out for him to take his time hiding there as she had more than enough bullets to kill him, as Davos had then questioned if Joy Meachum had recruited Walker to assassinate him, which Walker had openly denied as she instead claimed that she was only there for her amusement and because she really did not like Davos and had just wanted to see him dead.

Davos prepares to fight against Mary Walker
Seeking a way out of the situation, Davos lit up his Iron Fist and used it to punch a concrete block, launching it at Walker, who was able to move out of the way and took a different position, allowing Davos to move out of his cover and hide while Walker followed closely behind him. Having managed to get out of sight, Davos had warned that he would soon kill Walker and then Meachum, however Walker remained confident as she then promised to bring Meachum Davos' head on a stick. Walker's hunt for Davos was interrupted by the arrival of Rand and Wing, who then warned that Walker could not kill Davos.

Davos as he furiously attacks Colleen Wing
Charging out from his hiding place, Davos tackled Wing and pushed her away from Walker and Rand who then engaged in their own fight armed with Wing's Katana and Walker's Twin Machetes. Meanwhile, Davos demanded that Wing give him back what she had stolen from him, as they began furiously fighting, both proving themselves to be equally matched as they both continued to suffer from the effects of the transference ceremony. Getting Wing in a headlock, Davos then attempted to steal the power back, only for Wing to counter the hold and throw Davos away from her as they continued their fight.

Davos having a showdown with Colleen Wing
Attempting to gain the upper hand, Wing armed herself with a steel pole which she hit Davos with, as he managed to avoid most of the blows before disarming Wing and throwing her down onto her back. However, Wing continued fighting as neither could gain an advantage as they both landed strong blows on one another, with Wing's speed being put against the rage and power of Davos, with Wing managing to use Davos' rage against him as he charged at her only to then be thrown over Wing's shoulder. Taking advantage of this moment, Wing began beating down Davos and kicking him through a doorway.

Davos furiously tries to destroy Colleen Wing
Davos however soon recovered from his beatdown by Wing and got back onto his feet, pushing Wing back against the wall with several strong blows, before Davos summoned up the Iron Fist and furiously punched at Wing in an attempt to finally defeat her. However, Wing was barely able to avoid the deadly blow which had then completely obliterated the wall behind her, as Wing then pushed Davos outside to continue their fight. Wing then told Davos that the Iron Fist did not belong to him, and never did as he was unworthy, as Davos had then questioned if it did not belong to him, then who should get it.

Davos insists only he should hold the Iron Fist
Davos had noted that Wing was unworthy of the Iron Fist as she was a member of the Hand, while Rand was merely the pretender who fell from the sky and previously betrayed all the responsibility of the Iron Fist, while Davos was the last son of K'un-Lun, which Wing told did not matter before they engaged in their duel once again. Determined to ensure that he was the only one able to wield the power of the Iron Fist, Davos used all of his own remaining strength and skill to try and subdue Wing, landing a hard kick which knocked her onto her back, although Davos himself was still struggling to stand up himself.

Davos and Colleen Wing punch each other
With little options remaining, Davos channeled his Chi and had then summoned up the Iron Fist, seeking to land a final blow to end Wing. However as Davos launched himself through the air at her, Wing had summoned her own Iron Fist which she had used to counter Davos' punch. The combination of two Iron Fists making contact resulted in a shockwave which blew Davos and Wing backward, as Davos was slammed painfully into a stone wall behind him. Struggling to get on his feet, Davos went over to the now wounded Wing and pinned her down, attempting to complete the transference ceremony.

Davos fighting Danny Rand and Colleen Wing
However, before Davos could complete the ceremony, Wing was able to push him off her while Danny Rand rejoined the fight, having just helped Mary Walker to return to her calmly personality. Charging to Wing's aid, Rand managed to land a flying kick against Davos before the two former friends engaged in a brutal final battle, with Rand able to gain a clear advantage over Davos due to him still suffering from the burning dragon inside his body. Pushing him into an open space, Rand landed another kick against Davos before blocking all his next strikes and countering with a heavy hit directly to the head.

Davos has the Iron Fist stolen away from him
Although Davos fought back as best he could, managing to land his punch on Rand, the fight turned against him once again once Wing rejoined the fight, landing a kick which knocked Davos off his feet. With Davos now injured and lying on his back, Rand and Wing had managed to pin him down as they again performed the transference ceremony, with Davos this time being unable to get them off him as Wing was finally able to successfully complete the ceremony, ripping the power of the Iron Fist out of Davos' body, ending all the burning pain within them but leaving Davos without his own power.

Davos furiously screaming at Colleen Wing
Completely devastated by the defeat, Davos told Wing to end it once and for all by killing him, repeatedly telling her to end it, only for Wing to tell him that if she did, then she would be just like him. While Wing walked away from him, Davos screamed out in pain and frustration, as he continued to beg Wing to end his life, pushing Rand away from him as Davos got to his feet and screamed at Wing. In response to Davos' fury, Wing had then told Rand to move aside as she smashed her Iron Fist onto the ground, creating a shockwave which knocked Davos off his feet and subdued him, finally ending their fight.

Taken into Custody
Davos is taken into custody by the police
With their fight ended, Davos was handed over to the New York City Police Department to be put in custody, as he was handcuffed to an ambulance while they examined his injuries before taking him into custody. With Misty Knight ready to take Davos to jail, she offered Danny Rand a final chance to say goodbye to his friend and brother. Once they were alone, Rand told Davos that he did not want this situation to end this way, noting how he did everything to avoid it, as Davos questioned why Rand approached him with compassion.

Davos having his final talk with Danny Rand
While Rand insisted that his compassion was a choice that he made, Davos noted that Rand's choices in K'un-Lun had brought them to this moment, although Rand insisted that Davos had brought this on himself, while Davos claimed that he had grasped a glory with his actions that Rand could not even begin to comprehend, as Rand had insisted he did understand, but also knew that the cost was too high for such glory. Rand noted how it had taken a lot of effort for him to convince those around him not to kill Davos and give him one more chance, expressing his hope that Davos could honor that.

Davos insists that their fight is still not over
Davos questioned if Rand really believed he had won their fight, as he noted how he had inspired people with his actions, claiming there was nothing Rand could do to stop his message spreading into the world, while Rand claimed he was not giving up hope. Hearing this, Davos recalled how Lei Kung had referred to Rand as the Chosen of Heaven, Touched by Fire, which disgusted Davos as he noted how Rand had fought for the Iron Fist only to fill a void in himself, noting how while he chose his path and walked it, Rand still did not know who he really was, after which Rand said his final goodbye.

Personality
Davos carries himself with a stoic and dutiful attitude. Grown and raised in K'un-Lun, Davos was loyal to the ways of his home. Despite his stoicism, Davos was willing to engage in mischievous activities with his friend, Danny Rand. He remembered those times with fondness.

Once Rand got chosen to become the Iron Fist, Davos became jealous of his friend. Much of this jealousy stemmed from his own insecurities and a constant desire to prove himself to the Order of the Crane Mother and his own mother in particular. Nevertheless, he accepted that his friend was chosen and dutifully served with him to guard the gate to K'un-Lun. When Rand left and abandoned his duty, Davos felt betrayed by his friend's decision. When he found and reunited with Rand in New York City, Davos scorned and berated Rand for his decision. Nevertheless, he still regarded Rand as his friend and was willing to assist him in his quest to take down the Hand.

Due to his loyalty to K'un-Lun's teachings, which was fueled by his inner desire to become the Iron Fist, Davos was ruthless and bloodthirsty when he was fighting the Hand. During his fight against the Hand, he fought with lethal intent and when Colleen Wing hesitated to kill Bakuto, he went ahead and finished him off much to Rand's protest. Also due to his beliefs, he was unwilling to believe the sincerity of Wing's defection from the Hand which caused more tension in his friendship with Rand.

After acquiring the Iron Fist for himself, Davos developed an extremely black-and-white view of the world similar to Frank Castle, determined to destroy all crime and corruption in New York City by any means necessary. Unlike Frank, however, Davos was not above killing innocent civilians, such as Henry Yip, on the mere suspicion of being tied to a criminal organization. Also unlike Frank, he was perfectly willing to recruit and indoctrinate known criminals such as Chen Wu and Ryhno's Gang to further his goals, becoming no different from the very people he sought to destroy.

Ultimately, his loyalty and duty to K'un-Lun as well as being taught to hate the Hand are driving points for Davos' and Rand's brotherhood to break apart. But he does believe that it was also his father, Lei Kung's fault for choosing Rand to fight Shou-Lao. Filled with resentment, jealousy, envy, and hatred over Rand's failures as Iron Fist and his blatant abandonment to K'un-Lun, Davos became devoted on a quest to kill his former best friend.

Powers and Abilities
Former Powers
Davos summoning chi energy to his fist

Iron Fist Punch: By channeling Shou-Lao's stolen chi and focusing it into his hand, Davos can make his fist super-humanly powerful and resistant to injury and pain. With his fist in this state, Davos can exert superhuman strength and force with which he can punch through concrete walls, lead-lined doors, and punch his opponents with tremendous force that causes fatal injury or death. He was able to kill multiple muggers that were about to beat up a civilian with his chi, stop multiple guards in the club with using his chi sparingly and punch through a brick wall entirely. He was even able to kill Ho by sending him flying with a single punch to the chest and punch through Henry Yip's stomach. Davos was even able to focus his chi into both hands, usually by aggression in brief moments. Also, Davos' emotional, mental and physical state is essential to him using his powers, with drugs being able to suppress his chi and remove his ability to use the fist.
Chi Blast: Davos was able to completely destroy Rand and Colleen Wing’s Home by slamming his fist into the ground, sending waves of force that broke the windows, uprooted all the furniture and sent them flying upwards. Davos used these strikes without hesitation while facing his enemies, creating a trace of destruction where he fights.
Enhanced Stamina: By channeling his Chi, Davos’ stamina and resilience become greatly enhanced above normal human levels. Davos was able to hunt down multiple Triad gang headquarters and intensely fight dozens of men throughout the night, without feeling strain or becoming tired.

Davos manages to overpower Danny Rand
Master Martial Artist: Davos had been intensively trained by his father, Lei Kung in K'un-Lun ever since childhood as one of the potential candidates to become the next Iron Fist. Davos is an extremely skilled master of Kung Fu, he could assist Danny Rand fighting the Hand together. He could even fight evenly with Rand himself. His fighting style is identical to Rand and is composed of Wing Chun, Tai chi, Wushu, and the Dragon and Snake-style Kung Fu but more aggressive in comparison as he could efficiently disarm his enemies of weapons and violently used it against them. His skill in combat seems to have slightly improved further over time as at first Rand could beat him with some effort, but since reappearing in New York City, Rand had to fight at the absolute height of his ability the first two times almost ended in failure.
Master Marksman: Davos is shown to be a master marksman with his origami aluminum shurikens and throwing knives.

Weapons
Dagger: During his support in the fight at Harold Meachum's Penthouse, Davos managed to obtain one of the daggers that were carried by Bakuto's henchmen. He later used this dagger to stab Bakuto in the heart.
Hatchet: In a demonstration of power, Davos assaulted two members of the Yangsi Gonshi and used their trademark hatchets to brutally cut them down in front of Hai-Qing Yang. When Davos was later confronted by Liu, he was able to take Liu's hatchet and impaled him, before beheading him with the Iron Fist.
Other Equipment
Davos baring his own Mark of Shou-Lao
Mark of Shou-Lao: With the aid of the Crane Sisters, Davos had the mark of the Dragon tattooed onto his back, which had allowed him to absorb the Iron Fist away from Danny Rand and channel his Chi into his fist to turn it into the powerful weapon, making him the Immortal Iron Fist.
Tibetan Singing Bowl: In order to complete his ceremony to steal Rand's power away from him, Davos required an ancient bowl with mystic powers. Learning that Mika Prada now owned the bowl, Davos and Joy Meachum attempted to buy it for her, only to resort to blackmail when Prada had refused to sell. Once they had the bowl, Davos had the Crane Sisters combine Rand's blood and the Mark of Shou-Lao taken from the corpse of a previous Iron Fist, to make a mark for Davos in order to complete their ceremony. Knowing the importance of the bowl, Davos attempted to keep it hidden, only for Meachum to then recruit BB to take it and give it to Rand and Colleen Wing, who used the bowl's power to steal the power of the Iron Fist from Davos and give it to Wing.
Chen Wu's List: As Davos began his mission to end the Triad War by killing anyone associated with it, he recruited Chen Wu to write him a list of the names of members of the Golden Tigers and Yangsi Gonshi, so Davos could slaughter them, warning that he would put Wu's name on the list if he betrayed him.

Trivia
In the comics, Davos is also known as the Steel Serpent, and one of Danny Rand's main recurring enemies.
Despite regarding the food of Earth as "poison for both the mind and the body", Davos has shown a small appreciation for pizzas.
Although Davos claims to never eat meat, Danny Rand has claimed that while at K'un-Lun they used to occasionally eat donkey meat while they got tired of the vegetables being given to them.
Behind the Scenes
Sacha Dhawan worked with Benedict Cumberbatch in Sherlock shortly after he auditioned for the role of Davos. During this time, Cumberbatch contacted Marvel and put in a good word for Dhawan, ultimately helping him secure the role.
Malay Kim was a stunt double for Sacha Dhawan in the role of Davos.
