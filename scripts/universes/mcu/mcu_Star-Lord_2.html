<html><p>A few months after the Battle of Xandar, the Guardians of the Galaxy were hired by the High Priestess Ayesha, leader of the Sovereign race to defend some batteries from a creature known as the Abilisk. During the fight, Quill and the Guardians were badly beaten until Quill and Rocket forced the creature to look up, exposing a neck wound that Gamora widened to kill the creature.

Quill is questioned by Ayesha for his heritage
Afterwards, the Guardians were thanked by Ayesha, who handed over Nebula as part of trade due to having been arrested by the Sovereign. While flirting with Quill and discussing natural reproduction with him, Ayesha also made various disparaging comments about Quill's hybrid status that slightly upset him, as it caused him to wonder once again who his father was.

Escape from the Sovereign Fleet
Star-Lord attempts to escape the Sovereign
Later, after apologizing to Gamora for supposedly flirting with Ayesha, Drax the Destroyer told him he had no chance with her since he was a dancer whilst Gamora was not.

Quill crashed the ship on Berhert
The Guardians of the Galaxy were then attacked by a Sovereign fleet and discovered that Rocket Raccoon had stolen the Anulax Batteries from them. Star-Lord and Rocket tried to pilot the Milano to safety, but their arguments over who was the more capable pilot caused them to run into a Sovereign fleet trap. The ships were then suddenly destroyed by a mysterious figure in an oval-shaped vessel, but due to the damage caused to the Milano, they crashed on another planet.

Reunion with his Father
Meeting Ego
Star-Lord is reunited with his long lost father
As the Milano crash landed on Berhert, the Guardians of the Galaxy got out and immediately began arguing over who was responsible for the incident, with Star-Lord and Rocket Raccoon both blaming each other for the crash. As they were still all arguing, the Guardians were almost immediately greeted by their saviors, who were revealed to be Ego and his servant, Mantis. When asked who exactly he was, Ego introduced himself as Quill's own long lost father.

Quill and Ego discuss their long lost histories
The group set up a campfire where Ego explained that he had been searching for Quill ever since Yondu Udonta and his Ravagers had failed to deliver him as he was paid to do so. When asked how he had found them, Ego claimed that even as far out as he resided, he had heard stories of Star-Lord and his great victory over Ronan the Accuser during the Battle of Xandar. Ego promised Quill he would take him to his home planet and explain to him his true heritage while also getting to be the father to Quill that he had always wanted to be. Though initially skeptical, Gamora persuaded Quill that he should go with Ego to see Ego's own planet and finally learn the truth.

Quill, Gamora, and Drax head off with Ego
After the campfire from last night, Quill decided to take the risk and go along with Ego to see if he was telling the truth. On their way, Quill told Rocket to stay put, despite his remarks of his complete dismay of being reckless from crashing the ship. Drax the Destroyer and Gamora accompanied Quill, Ego and Mantis on board Ego's Ship whilst Rocket and Groot were told to remain on Berhert in order to repair the ship and guard Nebula to ensure that she did not attempt to escape. While onboard Ego's Ship, Quill watched as Mantis used her powers to help Ego sleep during the long journey.

Quill is touched by Mantis to feel his emotions
On the way, Mantis revealed her ability to feel the feelings of others and demonstrated by touching Quill and revealing his feelings for Gamora to everyone in the room. When Drax burst into hysterics at the announcement, Quill became defensive arguing that it was not that funny, though he was clearly embarrassed.

Bonding with Ego
Quill is welcomed onto Ego's home planet
Arriving on Ego's planet, Ego revealed that he was a Celestial and explained his origins. He revealed that the planet was a part of him and his human form was an avatar body he walked in to explore the Galaxy and seek other lifeforms. Ego explained how he met Meredith Quill and fell in love with her whilst visiting Earth and hired Yondu Udonta to bring Quill to him.

Quill learns of his and Ego's true heritage
Quill asked Ego why he then chose to leave his mother behind, and Ego revealed that he had to return to his planet otherwise his avatar body would die after prolonged distance from his main source. Ego then helped Quill to access his abilities as a Celestial which allowed him to create objects, greatly exciting Quill, who then proceeded to play catch with his father using a ball he had created.

Quill and Gamora dance on Ego's Planet
Quill later danced with Gamora trying to persuade her that she felt something for him too, something she denied. Gamora revealed her suspicions about the planet as Mantis seemed unusually fearful, but Quill argued that he had finally found his family and demanded to know why she couldn't be happy for him. Gamora mentioned that he had family on Earth but chose not to return there, and Quill explained that he had no desire to return to Earth since that is where his mother died. Gamora then stated that she thought he had found his family with the Guardians of the Galaxy before walking off due to Quill's arrogance.

Ego's Treachery
Quill is persuaded by Ego's advice
Ego came to comfort Quill afterwards and revealed that he was immortal due to his Celestial DNA and offered to bring him into what he had been working on. Excited, Quill accepted, which was overheard by Mantis. Ego explained what he had not told him earlier; that when he found the life he was disappointed by it which helped him find meaning then hypnotized Quill into helping him before continuing to tell his plans to him.

Quill seeing Eternity from his hypnosis
Ego revealed that he planned on improving the universe by planting parts of himself on every planet he visited. His plan was to bring all the planets together to become a part of himself. He revealed that on every planet he went to he would impregnate women to sire an offspring needed for his Expansion, as he needed two Celestial beings to activate the seeds he had left on each planet. Ego also had Yondu Udonta deliver some of the children to him; however, they never inherited his genes until Quill.

Star-Lord is captured by Ego's light tentacle
As Quill listened in forced silence, Ego cried out that he was no longer alone, reminding Quill of his friends. The bond he has for his friends and his mother, along with Ego's revelation that he had caused the death of Meredith Quill, enabled Quill to break free of Ego's control. In anger, Quill attacked his father, only for Ego to incapacitate him and begin his Expansion by harnessing his son to achieve his plan. However, Quill escaped when Ego was crushed by a ship piloted by Rocket Raccoon and Udonta as Mantis, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora and Nebula arrived to save Quill after learning of Ego's treachery from Mantis.

Ego's Expansion
Battle on Ego's Planet
Star-Lord and Yondu Udonta fly a Laser Drill
Mantis explained that Ego's only weakness was his brain at the core of the planet, so Star-Lord and Yondu Udonta piloted the industrial craft underground, tunneling through the planet surface. They arrived to find Ego's brain sealed in a core that was connected to the rest of the planet and began cutting into it, knowing they only had a limited time before Ego found them.

Quill and Rocket Raccoon escape together
They were interrupted when the Sovereign fleet arrived, causing Drax the Destroyer, Mantis, and Gamora to fall out of the craft. Mantis used her power to subdue Ego by putting him to sleep whilst Star-Lord, Rocket Raccoon and Groot flew to the core to plant a bomb on Ego made from the Anulax Batteries stolen from the Sovereign and Nebula and Udonta piloted the ship. Star-Lord defended the core from the Sovereign while Rocket gave Groot the bomb, temporarily taking a break to ask if anyone had any tape to put over the death button.

Star-Lord argues with Rocket Raccoon
He then argued with Rocket after the answer being 'no' with Groot running off whilst still being unsure about how to operate the bomb. Quill continued to fight the Sovereign before being shot at and knocked back into the ship. When the ship exploded after Nebula hacked herself into the infrastructure, Quill floated down with Udonta, who used his Yaka Arrow, commenting that the Udonta looked like Mary Poppins and assuring him that "he" was very cool.

Quill battles against Ego with Celestial powers
Mantis was then knocked out by a piece of shrapnel which awoke Ego, who began to fight the Guardians of the Galaxy. After subduing all of them, Ego resumed using his power to force Quill into reactivating the seedlings around the universe. However, from Udonta's encouragement and advice on how he uses his arrow, Quill recalls all the good times he shared with everyone he cares about, his mother, friends, and Udonta. Those feelings of love and friendship was so strong it helped Quill unlock his own Celestial power to fight his father, creating a giant rock-like glove to punch him. Quill distracted his father enough to free his friends, Nebula and Udonta from his grasp and stop the seedlings. Quill also used his Celestial powers to construct a rocky giant avatar resembling Pac-Man to hit Ego with.

Star-Lord fights off all of Ego's many attacks
Both eventually collapsed into exhaustion with Ego furiously trying to plead with Quill to help him after discovering the bomb on his brain. Ego told Quill that with Ego dead, Quill's powers would fade away and he would be rendered mortal. Quill stated that he accepted this fact, much to his father's horror. He held him down as the bomb exploded, destroying Ego's brain and grievously watched as his father's avatar passed away in his arms, while his Celestial powers seemingly faded away.

Yondu Udonta's Sacrifice
Star-Lord being saved by Yondu Udonta
Without Ego's essence, the planet began to break down and collapse in on itself. A ship piloted by Kraglin Obfonteri rescued the other Guardians, leaving Quill stranded at the core. As Quill accepted his fate, content that he had managed to protect his friends, Yondu Udonta saved Quill with an Aero-Rig, telling him that Ego may have been his biological father, but he wasn't his "daddy".

Star-Lord watches Yondu Udonta die

Udonta then gave him the only holographic space suit, much to Quill's horror, as he knew that would leave Yondu defenseless against the vacuum of space. As he frantically tried to give it to Udonta, he was stopped by his adopted father, who used the last of his strength to silently told him that it was okay, and Quill broke down crying as Udonta ultimately succumbed and died, devastated over the death of the only father figure he ever had. 
Aftermath
Yondu Udonta's Funeral
Quill pays tribute to Yondu Udonta at his funeral
In the wake of Yondu Udonta's death, Quill came to realize that Udonta was the father figure in his life he had always been searching for before Kraglin Obfonteri and the other Guardians of the Galaxy burned the body as part of a Ravager funeral. Obfonteri gave Quill a 'Zune' that Udonta had bought for him that contained 300 tracks that 'everyone' on Earth was now listening to while Quill gave him Udonta's Yaka Arrow.

Quill watches the Ravagers Farewell
Quill listened to his new Zune with Groot before noticing the arrival of the other Ravagers who had heard about Udonta's sacrifice and re-accepted him as one of their own, with the tributes being led by Stakar Ogord. Quill and the other Guardians of the Galaxy watched as Udonta was honored with a proper Ravager funeral and Gamora hinted to Quill that she may reciprocate his feelings, with the two embracing.

Adolescent Groot
Quill remotely argues with adolescent Groot
Four years later, Quill told a now-adolescent Groot to tidy his room and to stop wasting his time playing a video game. Quill then noted that Groot acted the same way he had as a teenager, commenting that now he knew how Yondu had felt when dealing with him when he was one.

Infinity War
Asgardian Distress Call
Star-Lord arrives at the distress call location
Quill directed the Guardians of the Galaxy to respond to a distress signal sent out by the Asgardian ship, the Statesman. Rocket questioned why they were answering the distress call; Gamora told him that it was because people were in trouble. Quill told him that they were also doing it to see what kind of reward they could get, but had to reassure Gamora that he was only saying that for Rocket's benefit. Arriving at the wreck of the Statesman they brought the only survivor, Thor, aboard.

The Guardians of the Galaxy meet Thor
Quill was put out by his team's fascination over the Asgardian. Both Drax and Gamora were taken with his physique. In an effort to overshadow Thor, Quill deepened his voice and tried to imitate the Asgardian. Once Thor filled them in on Thanos' plans to collect all the Infinity Stones and wipe out half of the universe's life, he departed for Nidavellir with Rocket and Groot. Quill led Gamora, Drax, and Mantis to Knowhere to stop Thanos from obtaining the Reality Stone.

Tracking Down the Reality Stone
Quill makes a promise to Gamora
On the way to Knowhere, Gamora made Quill promise that if Thanos captured her, then he would kill her rather than let her be taken. When Quill asked why she told him that she knew something that Thanos must never find out. Quill wanted to know what it was, but Gamora refused to tell him. Quill promised to kill her if the time came, and they kissed, but the moment was killed by the presence of Drax who had been watching them.

Star-Lord takes the Guardians to Knowhere
As they approached, the Guardians found Thanos brutally interrogating the Collector for the whereabouts of the Reality Stone. Despite Star-Lord's attempts to command the Guardians to hold the position, they continued to close in on Thanos, hiding behind the remnants of the Collector's museum to spy on Thanos.

Quill fails to lead his team in Knowhere
However, Drax almost compromised the Guardians' position due to his anger of Thanos' campaign killing his wife Ovette and his daughter Kamaria. Star-Lord attempted to convince him to wait, noting that Thanos did not have the Stone yet, thus they could still take it from him before he noticed. His attempt was unsuccessful, however, with Drax ignoring Quill, prompting Mantis to force him to sleep in order to prevent him blowing their cover.

Quill and Drax witness Gamora seemingly killing Thanos
Star-Lord could give combat instructions to Gamora and Mantis, Gamora swiftly attacked Thanos without waiting, engaging in melee combat with her sword Godslayer. However, while Thanos managed to destroy Godslayer, Gamora quickly fatally stabbed him, with the remains of Godslayer and the switchblade Thanos had offered her as a child. Their victory was short-lived as Thanos revealed that it had been a ruse. He already possessed the Reality Stone and had engineered the entire situation to capture Gamora. He effortlessly took Mantis and Drax out of the fight.

Star-Lord confronting Thanos
Quill confronted Thanos threatening to kill him if he does release Gamora. Quill was reminded by Gamora his promise to kill her if she was captured by Thanos. Reluctantly, Quill pointed his Quad Blaster at Gamora, though Thanos was skeptical that Quill would have the courage to follow through on his promise. But, as they confessed their love to each other, Quill finally pulled the trigger. However, the Blaster only fired harmless bubbles which Thanos used the Reality Stone to transforming the blaster into bubbles. Thanos was impressed with Quill for having the courage to do what was necessary. Then Thanos teleported himself and Gamora away with the Space Stone, leaving an astonished Quill behind with the broken Godslayer, as Drax and Mantis reconstituted themselves in the absence of the Reality Stone's effects.

Meeting the Avengers
Star-Lord restraining Spider-Man
The Guardians, acting on a tip from the escaped Nebula, landed on Titan with the aim to ambush Thanos there. The Guardians raided the Q-Ship and attacked Spider-Man, Iron Man and Doctor Strange each believing the other to be working for Thanos. However, after a tense standoff, both parties realized they came from Earth and shared the same goal, before deciding to work together to ambush Thanos, who they expected to be arriving soon.

Star-Lord comes up with a plan with Iron Man
Awaiting Thanos' arrival, Iron Man, Spider-Man and the Guardians attempted to formulate a plan of attack, while Strange activated the Time Stone to view all possible outcomes and futures of the coming battle. Worried, Star-Lord asked how many he saw, as Strange saying he had seen exactly 14,000,605 possible timelines, Strange gravely informed the others that only one timeline ended in Thanos' defeat.

Battle of Titan
Star-Lord readies his position to attack Thanos
Thanos arrived on Titan only to find Doctor Strange waiting for him. The other assembled heroes used the element of surprise to attack the Mad Titan. During the battle, Star-Lord quickly took position behind Thanos and began to close in, shooting him with his Quad Blasters to gain his attention.

Star-Lord shooting a Gravity Mine at Thanos
Running on energy platforms conjured by Strange to dodge blasts from the Power Stone, Star-Lord managed to discreetly plant an explosive on Thanos' back. Taking a moment to quickly insult Thanos and escape through a portal conjured by Strange, the Guardian detonated the explosive, briefly stunning Thanos. Later, Star-Lord would fly back into the battle and launched a Gravity Mine at Thanos using his Blasters, ensnaring his right arm.

Star-Lord attacks Thanos and ruins the plan
Star-Lord approached and taunted the half-conscious Thanos, before demanding the location of Gamora. At this remark, Thanos began to react in anguish, with Mantis sensing that he was mourning. Nebula began to realize in horror and sadness that he was in fact, mourning Gamora, having sacrificed her on Vormir for the Soul Stone. In denial, Star-Lord angrily asked Thanos to tell him that Gamora was alive, only for Thanos to lament that he had no choice but to kill her, confirming Nebula's suspicions. Enraged, and despite Iron Man's attempts to restrain him, Star-Lord began to ruthlessly attack Thanos without thinking, inadvertently breaking Mantis' control over Thanos. Star-Lord, Drax and Nebula all had their souls removed by Thanos with a single wild shockwave from the Soul Stone. Spider-Man saved the three unconscious Guardians, where their souls were restored by Mantis.

Star-Lord furiously attempts to shoot Thanos
Thanos is suddenly attacked by Quill, who tried to defeat him once more, but his blasters didn't cause him any injury. Thanos then created a portal to Earth and headed for Wakanda. When Iron Man asked why Doctor Strange gave up the stone, he informed him that they were now in the endgame.

Thanos' Victory
Star-Lord being turned into dust by Thanos
As the heroes recovered in the aftermath of the battle of Titan, Thanos obtained the last remaining stone, the Mind Stone from Vision, and wiped out half of the universe with the snap of his fingers. On Titan, Quill disintegrated into ashes after watching his fellow Guardians, Mantis and Drax fade away.

Battle of Earth
Star-Lord rejoining the battle against Thanos
Five years later, the Avengers were successful in collecting all the Infinity Stones, bringing Star-Lord, as well as everyone else who had died from the Snap back to life. Back on Titan, Doctor Strange informed them of the situation and opened a portal to Earth to help fight against Thanos and his army.

Star-Lord fires at Thanos' army
Returning to Earth for the first time in 35 years, Star-Lord then stood alongside the epic line of assembled heroes, as Captain America led the charge against the opposing army. Star-Lord fired at Thanos' army from the skies using his Jet Boot Attachments until he was dragged down, where he fought off a group of Sakaarans. However, they overpowered him, knocking him to the ground and were about to finish him when he was suddenly saved.

Star-Lord encounters Gamora from 2014
When he looked up, he discovered Gamora standing before him, unaware that it was her from another timeline. Confused, he approached her, and went to caress her face, but she stopped him and knocked him to the ground, telling him not to touch her, as she had not encountered him before. When Nebula joined them, Star-Lord looked to her in confusion about Gamora.

Guardians Reassembled
Tony Stark's Funeral
Quill attends the funeral for Tony Stark
The battle was ultimately concluded when Iron Man obtained the Infinity Stones and wiped out Thanos and his army. However, this action cost Iron Man his life due to the power of the Infinity Stones. Following Hawkeye, all the heroes show their respect for the fallen hero and kneeled before him. Later, all the heroes gathered again at the Stark Eco-Compound to attend his funeral. Quill stood with the reunited Guardians of the Galaxy to honor the hero he fought alongside.

Search for Gamora
Quill starts a search for 2014 Gamora
After receiving the Benatar, Quill attempted to leave Earth as fast as he could, despising the planet as he associated it with his mother's death. Piloting the Benatar, Quill flew from New York to New Asgard in Norway, and as Rocket Raccoon set out to retrieve Thor, Quill started a search for Gamora, who left after the Battle of Earth.

Quill's role as leader is challenged by Thor
When Thor boarded the Benatar, he asked what their next destination would be, touching the map, which Quill moved back, feeling insecure about his position as leader. He then reaffirmed his status to Thor as the rest of the Guardians then suggested that they should fight each other for leadership, which they both laughed off, saying it would not be necessary because Thor saw him as leader.

Time Heist
Theft of the Power Stone
Star-Lord is knocked out by War Machine
In an alternate 2014, Quill arrived on Morag to retrieve the Orb, dancing and singing out loud to his music as he explored the temple. Suddenly, Quill was knocked out by War Machine, who had traveled from 2023 with Nebula, to prevent him from stealing the Orb. Nebula then stole a tool from his unconscious body and used it to retrieve the Orb.

Personality
Peter Quill was abducted from Earth by the thieves and smugglers called the Ravagers. Their leader, Yondu Udonta raised Quill and showed him how to survive in deep space. Udonta also taught Quill how to be the perfect thief. Peter Quill is naturally upbeat and sarcastic and is known for looking on the bright side. It seems that his 1980s pop culture-laden references his life on Earth.

He is also very protective of his Sony Walkman that was given to him by his mother. This was shown numerous times when he attempted to assault a prison guard who took it, and when during the prison break when Quill made his way back into the prison just to retrieve the device. Later, Quill's anger for his father was more focused due to Ego breaking the Walkman despite the confession that Ego had also murdered his mother. Being a memento of his mother, it's quite understandable why Quill was so protective and possessive of his Walkman.

Before joining the Guardians, Quill lived in the ways of an average criminal and thug, going so far as killing Sakaarans and attempting to kill Korath himself when they seemingly threatened his well being as they were arresting him for interrogation by Ronan. Although, he only attacked them when he was aware that he could get the drop on them and win, as well as when he knew that he could not convince them to let him go. However, he merely stunned and knocked out the guards on the Kyln with his Quad Blasters instead of using lethal force, which shows that he only would kill to defend himself or in battles with foes that are outside the law, such as Ronan and Korath's men. He is very conscientious of his physical weaknesses, which prevents him from acting impulsive as he is always aware of the dangers of his actions, especially in combat.

Quill has shown he can be heroic; he was unwilling to watch Gamora die in space, so he exited his pod giving Gamora his mask, saving her life, nearly at the cost of his own. He was also the one who brought the Guardians together to save Xandar, showcasing his leadership qualities and a certain amount of charisma since all the members were well-known outlaws. While not showing it often, and despite his womanizing habits, Quill does have romantic feelings for Gamora, and even though she puts up a serious and cold demeanor towards him, she also reciprocates his feelings. This eventually changed a few years later where they both admitted their feelings for each other, with Gamora just moments before being captured by Thanos and eventually dying, confessed that she loved Peter more than anything. Peter likewise was also extremely affected after learning of her death to the point of going into an extreme rage and viciously attacking Thanos in retaliation.

Quill can create inventively, and often extremely unorthodox, solutions to problems on the fly. His confrontation with Ronan the Accuser is an example of this, distracting him long enough for Rocket Raccoon and Drax the Destroyer to put the Enforcer back together to destroy Ronan's hammer to break loose the stone. He even created a more unorthodox but successful plan with the Avengers on how to stop Thanos. This was later unsuccessful as Quill soon broke the plan when he went into a rage upon learning that Thanos had killed Gamora.

Due to being raised as a child by aliens, having possibly not learned just how weak humans are compared to other beings, he never suspected that he was half alien himself and assumed his inhuman resilience to be normal for any kind of creature. Furthermore, he appears out of touch with modern earthlings, as he barely associated with Stark and Spider-Man because of his out of date references.

Quill’s sense of humor is similar to Tony Stark and Stephen Strange. There were many pieces of evidence of this such as when he claimed Stark's plan in attacking Thanos was good but dumb and that if he came up with the plan then it would be better.

Quill has a strong love towards his family and loved ones, which drives him to protect those around him and makes him reluctant to hurt his friends. However, his emotions tend to get the best of him, as he is prone to outburst of rage and sadness when confronted by the death of a loved one. This best seen when he learned the truth behind his mother's death and when he found out Thanos killed Gamora. Likewise, Quill had a very hard time accepting his mother's death, shown by how he refused to open the last present she gave him for more than twenty years because he was told to open it after she died. He still thinks about her and has grown to dislike Earth, due to the fact that is where he left his mother and because his father told him that his mother being connected to the planet was holding him back and why she died. Indeed, he has not visited Earth in years. After returning for the first time in decades, he wanted to leave as quick as possible.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Hybrid Physiology: Due to his heritage, he is part Celestial and part human, giving him superhuman abilities. Even while not having awakened his celestial power, Quill had enough power to briefly survive while holding the Power Stone on his own and after awakening his full power, was able to challenge his father, a true Celestial, who had easily subdued the other Guardians. Although he seems to have lost his cosmic powers after Ego died, Quill retained his superhuman physical powers.

Superhuman Durability: Due to his paternal heritage from Ego, Quill holds considerable amounts of supernatural durability and endurance to the point that he even was able to physically withstand the exposure to the energy from an Infinity Stone. He held the Power Stone for a short length of time without dying and was able to harness its power when sharing the burden with the other Guardians. Quill himself also noted that he was able to survive numerous injuries while working for the Ravagers, though none were implausible enough to raise any suspicion. He is also capable of withstanding the strong blows of the Abilisk tentacles without damage of his body. When he fought Ego, he was able to withstand Ego's attacks and only had minor injuries at the end of the fight. Later, Quill managed to survive a shockwave from Thanos using the Infinity Gauntlet and quickly recovered.
Regenerative Healing Factor: After holding the Power Stone in his bare hands, Quill sustained severe burns and scars all over his body. Thanks to his latent Celestial powers, he was able to heal all his injuries with no trace of scar tissue in the remaining time before his meeting with the Nova Corps mere days later.
Former Powers
Molecular Manipulation: While battling Ego, Yondu Udonta's encouragement allowed Star-Lord to realize his ability to manipulate matter. He used it to propel himself into the air at a high velocity. He was able to construct things and weapons out of matter, such as gloves of rock to punch his father and later he enveloped himself into a giant Pac-Man to counter the giant materialized by his father.
Star-Lord and Ego manipulating light
Energy Manipulation: While on Ego's planet, Ego taught him how to manipulate energy and how to use it to create solid constructions by drawing energy from the planet. He once created a ball to play catch with his father, like he always dreamed of. He can even empower his fists with energy to produce superhuman physical strikes, such as when he did with his father moments prior to his father's death.
Self-Augmentation: Quill used his cosmic power to enhance his physical strength and durability to the point where he was almost immune to damage, allowing him to easily smash through stone and survive crashing into the ground at bullet-like speed.
Immortality: While battling his father Ego, Ego told him that as long as Ego's essence is still alive, Star-Lord himself will never die. He lost this ability, as seen when he succumbed to the Snap.
Abilities
Expert Combatant: Quill is highly trained in close-quarters combat, both in armed and hand-to-hand combat. He was even able to stand his ground against Gamora, the finest assassin trained by Thanos, in a fist fight. He uses his two blasters as melee weapons to strike and knock his foes unconscious with a hard strike to the head with great skill. He was able to easily take down multiple Nova Corps, Kyln, and Sakaaran soldiers by striking them with the blasters. Quill also managed to easily subdue and hold the superhuman, but inexperienced Spider-Man at gunpoint during their brief skirmish, as well as dodge blasts sent at him by Thanos using the Power Stone and even plant an explosion on Thanos himself, although he did had aid from Doctor Strange's use of Eldritch Magic to conjure platforms, which helped him maneuver through Thanos' attacks and plant the device.
Expert Marksman: Having been instructed by Yondu, Quill is well-versed in the use of weapons from all over the galaxy, but he prefers using his own Quad Blasters, which he is shown to be accomplished with. He also handled a Kyln Guard's rifle, a weapon he was not believed to have ever seen before, and easily shot and destroyed a drone with it. He even accurately shot Spider-Man during their skirmish and trapped him long enough to hold him at gunpoint.
Master Tactician: Quill is an exceptional tactician, as shown when after finding Iron Man's plan to suck, Quill took the lead and made his own plan to stop Thanos and was nearly successful until he broke the group's hold on him after going into a rage on learning Gamora’s death. He also played a key role in fighting and coordinating strategy during the Battle of Xandar.
Expert Thief: Raised by the Ravagers, Quill was highly trained in the art of thievery and evasion. Though Star-Lord had a criminal record, thievery was not one of the charges, though Rhomann Dey picked him up for petty theft.
Master Pilot: Quill is an accomplished starship pilot. He has used this skill to escape Korath and his men on Morag.
Bilingualism: While Quill speaks English, he is capable of understanding the Groot language after having spent four years with Groot.
Equipment
Weapons
Star-Lord firing at Nova Corps with his blasters
Quad Blasters: Quill carries dual direct energy weapons in the form of handguns. They each have two triggers for the index and middle finger for the top and bottom barrel respectively, with the bottom barrel shooting lightning and the top barrel shooting fiery bolts or blasts. While the fire-like blast on the top barrel is lethal, killing its live targets on impact and even sends the target flying backwards with great force, the bottom barrel produces streaks of nonlethal electricity to electrocute its targets and incapacitate them. He has used his two blasters as melee weapons in the past to strike and knock out his foes, specifically Kyln Guards, with a strike to the head. He was even shown striking enemies with the barrels while shooting the lethal setting, which allowed him to hit harder and harm stronger opponents. While fighting Thanos on Titan, he demonstrated being able to load specialized projectile attachments onto the barrel of his weapons, one of being a stunning device powerful enough to cause Thanos pain.
Nova Machine Gun: Quill stole this gun from a Kyln guard to shoot down attacking hoverbots during his escape.
Energy Bolas: A hi-tech version of an ancient throwing weapon made of weights on the ends of an interconnected energy cord, designed to capture targets by entangling their legs. During the Attack on Peter Quill, Star-Lord used these Bolas to try and subdue Gamora, although she quickly escaped.
Hadron Enforcer: Designed and built by Rocket Raccoon, the Enforcer shoots a concentrated bolt of nuclear explosive force that only detonates on its target. The mass and size of the target determine how large the explosion will be. Rocket claimed it could destroy a moon. He briefly handled the weapon in the Guardians plan to kill Ronan the Accuser, but has not held it since.
Power Stone: During their final battle with Ronan the Accuser, Quill and the other Guardians of the Galaxy used the Power Stone in tandem to direct the Stone's energy at Ronan, destroying his body and killing him.
Items
Helmet: Quill wears a helmet that shows threats on HUD and has internal comm systems. The helmet allows him to breathe in the vacuum of space. When he presses the button on the side of his head, light blue energy wraps around his face and the back of his head and becomes the helmet.
Star-Lord flying through space with his boots
Jet Boot Attachments: Quill has jets that he attaches to his boots to make jet boots, while he activates them with buttons on his leg. The jet attachments can rotate in any direction and can be used to propel him through the air at great speed, though they do not allow for sustained flight and only allow him to jump and briefly float for several feet. They can also be used in flying in deep space due to the lack of gravity and weight removing the limitations they experience in environments of normal gravity. Quill improvised the technology as weapons by attaching one of them on a hostile and activated them, which sent the target flying backwards.
Translator Implant: Star-Lord has a translator implanted in his neck that helps him understand many of the languages of almost every known species in the universe.
Star-Lord and Rocket using Aero-Rigs to fly
Lock Pick: A small device designed to automatically open doors, used on the one guarding the Temple Vault in Morag to effortlessly enter the room storing the Orb.
Plasma Sphere: One of Peter Quill's gadgetry and weapons is a glass-like ball that much like a glowstick, lit up when shook. It was dangerous when shattered, as it could ensnare and disintegrate living creatures in a cloud of its released plasma, though it quickly diminishes.
Holo-Map Projector: Part of his arsenal and tools is a holographic device given him by the Broker, Quill able to project and Holographic Map on the planet Morag of the size of a football field and projects what was there before, even people moving around. Quill scanned the ruined temple area of Morag and could identify the creatures and people living their before. It could also highlight a certain area red to show Star-Lord where it detects a certain object. This is how Quill knew to go up the temple stairs to find the Orb.
Gravity Mine: A device that could exert greater amounts of the force of gravity on a designated object and gravitate it towards itself was in Quill's possession. It can generate gravity as powerful as a planet and pull something to itself as if the object were in a planet's orbit. If it is not programmed to pull a certain object while active, it will pull everything in a 1-foot radius towards itself at great speed. Quill used this to incapacitate Korath's troops before it was shot and destroyed.
Orb: To be added
Aero-Rigs: Quill uses one of Rocket Raccoon's jet-pack like devices to seamlessly fly through the air, giving him great mobility in combat. Unlike his jet boot, Aero-Rig allows Quill sustained flight to any altitude.

Earth Memorabilia
Much of his personal items from Earth traveled with him when he was taken by the Ravagers as a child. His ship, the Milano, once housed this memorabilia, with the songs from his Walkman being able to be played on the ships sound system, with what appeared to be a stereo being added to the ship. The ship was abandoned on Berhert.

Peter Quill's Sony Walkman
Sony TPS-L2 Walkman Headset: Quill is very protective of his Sony Walkman; when deprived of it in prison, he challenged a guard for its return but was electrocuted in response. He received it from his mother, along with two mixtapes containing several songs from the 60's all the way through to the '80s. Unfortunately, this Walkman was destroyed by Ego after revealing to Peter that he put the tumor inside Meredith Quill's head.
Awesome Mix Vol. 1: Meredith Quill put together a mixtape named Awesome Mix Vol. 1 so that her son could listen to songs she used to listen to when she was growing up.
Awesome Mix Vol. 2: When Meredith was dying from cancer and gave her son a second mixtape as a gift, as moments before she died. However, Quill never opened his gift and kept the tape as one of the few mementos from Earth. After he and the other Guardians of the Galaxy members saved Xandar from Ronan, he finally opened his mother's gift. Unfortunately, the cassette was inside the Walkman when Ego crushed it.

Troll doll: A type of plastic doll with furry up-combed hair, depicting a troll. Quill uses it as a memento from Earth.

Puffy Stickers: An assortment of ALF Puffy Stickers was used all over the Milano, sticking towards his cassette deck.
Scratch and Sniff Stickers: Quill had a few stickers that were sticking onto his cassette deck, these stickers are made so that when scratched, they release a scent. This scent is normally related to the image displayed.
Zune Music player: Zune was a brand of digital media products and services marketed by Microsoft. Kraglin Obfonteri gave Quill a Zune as a present from Yondu after his death, intended to be given upon Quill's return to the Ravagers. Obfonteri said Yondu, "Found it at a junker shop" and "it has over three hundred songs." This replaces the Walkman destroyed by Ego.
Mattel Electronics Football Tracker: While the Guardians of the Galaxy were hired by the High Priestess Ayesha, leader of the Sovereign race to defend some batteries from the Abilisk, Quill uses a monitor to track down the creature so that team would know where it was coming.
Defender Arcade Game: When Groot started to go into his adolescent years, he began to play Quill's Defender game. He would spend practically all his time on it wherever he went, including meeting Thor and helping him forge a new weapon.
