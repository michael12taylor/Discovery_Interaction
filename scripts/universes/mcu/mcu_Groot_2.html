<html><p>Thanos soon united the Infinity Stones within his gauntlet and snapped his fingers, which began killing half of the universe's population. Groot was one of the many who turned to dust as a result of Thanos' successful mass genocide; as he began to fade away Groot tried to speak to Rocket Raccoon, calling for his surrogate father, who tearfully watched Groot die helplessly.

Battle of Earth
Groot returns to battle against Thanos' forces
Five years later, Groot, among many others, was successfully restored to life after Bruce Banner resurrected the victims of the Snap using Infinity Stones gathered from different points in the past. He was enlisted by Doctor Strange to assist the Avengers in fighting against an alternate Thanos and his armies.

Groot stands alongside the assembled heroes
Alongside Bucky Barnes, he left Wakanda through an Inter-Dimensional Portal and arrived onto the battlefield of the destroyed New Avengers Facility to assist the heroes in the massive battle against Thanos and his army. Groot then stood alongside the assembled heroes as Captain America led the charge.

Groot is reunited with Rocket Raccoon in battle
During the battle, Groot was reunited with Rocket Raccoon when Thanos called for an airstrike to halt Scarlet Witch's attacks. Groot was knocked back by one of the blasts and Rocket attempted to shield him from a turret targeting them directly.

Groot witnesses the return of Captain Marvel
When the guns stopped firing at them, Groot looked up to see Captain Marvel arriving, who destroyed the Sanctuary II, much to his relief. Eventually, the battle was concluded when Iron Man used the Infinity Stones to wipe out Thanos and his army out of existence at the cost of his own life.

Guardians Reassembled
Groot attending the funeral of Tony Stark
After the battle, Groot attended Tony Stark's funeral along with the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Groot stood with the rest of the Guardians as they watched Pepper Potts and her daughter place Stark's Arc Reactor in the lake.

Groot agrees for Thor and Star-Lord to fight
They then returned to the Benatar and flew to New Asgard to pick up Thor, who had decided to join them on their adventures. He happily chimed in on the prospect of Star-Lord and Thor fighting for the leadership of the team, agreeing to the proposition of using knives in their fight.



Personality
Groot is usually very gentle and warm, displaying kindness towards innocent life. His child-like personality often causes him to be distracted and simple-minded, such as by a water fountain that he kept drinking from in public while Rocket was trying to talk to him and then trying to deny it. He tends to not listen to plans and goes off to tackle threats on his own, such as when he wandered off from Rocket to remove a power source in the Kyln without listening to the full plan and missing the fact that it needed to be taken last.  

During intense or serious situations, Groot is sometimes smiling gleefully, such as when he and Rocket where trying to abduct Peter Quill on Xandar or after impaling several Sakaarans on his vines and angrily thrashing them around a hallway for several seconds. He is loyal to Rocket and the other Guardians, and was even willing to die to protect them, as shown in the Battle of Xandar. However, he can also be merciless and savagely brutal towards his enemies, especially if they threaten his friends, as shown when lifted an inmate on the Kyln into the air by his nose to cause him enough pain to leave him sobbing on the floor, all just because he got in the way of himself and Rocket and threatened Quill, who was their bounty.

As a baby, Groot could be shown to misinterpret simple requests such as bringing Yondu a prototype for his weapon and knowing which button to press to activate a bomb that would kill Ego's consciousness. He enjoys listening and dancing to music, even while his friends were battling the Abilisk. Similar to a human baby, Groot is deeply affectionate and seeks the company and comforting arms of his friends, sometimes falling asleep on their shoulders like he did with Drax. Despite this, he retains his savage and violent nature, as shown when he would regularly attack small creatures and angrily attacking and sending Retch falling to his death in revenge for being abused by him. He also attempted to attack Drax twice, once for bumping into him and another time for crashing into a stereo that was playing a song he was dancing to, though his small size made his strikes unable to faze Drax anyway.

He also has used curse words before and could use them adamantly, but Rocket could just leave them out in his translation of Groot to the other Guardians.

As an adolescent, Groot displays the typical behavior of a human teenager, such as being rude, making a mess of his own space and getting obsessed with playing video games. Unlike his father, he hardly smiles and seems to be unaware of his surroundings most of the time. He frequently snaps at his Guardian companions when he gets told off, resulting in them, notably Rocket and Peter murmuring about how they miss the old Groot and how annoying the new Groot is. Nevertheless, Groot's loyalty to his companions remain as strong as ever and he staunchly stands by them during fights, fully retaining his old courage and headstrong nature. He even went as far as to resist the pain of the newly heated pieces of Stormbreaker and sacrificed his arm to create the axe without hesitation. He also seemed to look up to Rocket, referring to him as "Dad" in his native tongue as he faded away.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Flora Colossus Physiology: Groot is a Flora colossus, an ancient race of tree-like humanoid beings, with superhuman abilities.
Superhuman Strength: Groot is capable of great feats of strength, from breaking sturdy metal items to fighting other strong opponents and lifting and flailing around ten armored warriors with comparative ease. As Baby Groot, he was able to strangle the larger Retch with his vines before throwing him off the catwalk, killing him upon the impact. He was also able to impale three Outriders with his branches and lift them effortlessly.
Superhuman Durability: The skin of Groot is composed entirely of a dense and durable wood, thus allowing him to easily sustain large amounts of damage from firearms, melee weapons and explosions. He can easily hold against several blows of Gamora's sword, various shots of the Kyln Hoverbots, multiple punches from Drax, and Sakaarans' attacks.
Body Manipulation: Groot has the ability to change his physical form, and shape his body in various ways. He can also manipulate his body to form organic constructs that he uses as tools or weapons.
Elasticity: Groot can extend any part of his body to make himself longer. He can make himself taller and extend his fingers and arms.
Flower Generation: Groot is able to grow flowers out of his palms.
Leaf Generation: While forming a protective sphere around the Guardians, Groot was able to generate leaves inside it.
Branch Shield: Groot can coat his arms in a shell seemingly composed entirely of twigs. The resulting shield is bulletproof. To save the Guardians when the Dark Aster fell, Groot shaped his whole body into a massive sphere. The sphere was able to save the lives of the Guardians, although it was completely destroyed along with Groot's body.
Vine Tentacles: Groot is able to create and manipulate many vine-like appendages to interact with objects or people. While attempting to capture Star-Lord, he used several of these appendages to hold Gamora. He also used them to try to stifle Drax, but they were quickly destroyed. Furthermore, he attempted to subdue Thanos by smashing the ground which sent a swarm of vines to him, but Thanos instantly overpowered the vines and escaped out of them.
Twig Spikes: Groot can briefly grow rows of sharp twigs from various parts of his body. He used one of these spikes to pierce Drax's chest, giving him a hole to breathe through.
Light Generation:    Groot emitting bioluminescent spores for light   Groot is able to emit bioluminescent spores that provide light. He used this in order for he and the Guardians to see in the Dark Aster.
Regenerative Healing Factor: Groot's biology is made up entirely of plant-like tissues, granting him highly developed regenerative abilities. He can regrow lost limbs in a few hours. In combat, Groot's advanced regeneration gives him the ability to survive almost any attack. His body can immediately heal sustained damage, which, in combination with his rapid growth, makes him extremely difficult to kill.
Rebirth: Groot can rebirth himself after his death. Should a Groot be destroyed, remaining twigs can be planted to give birth to a new Groot, although as an offspring it will not retain the memories or personality of the original.
Longevity: Groot's species are capable of living for centuries.

Abilities
Combatant: Heavily relying on his brute strength, Groot was able to single-handedly destroy multiple turrets and fight dozens of Sakaarans at once, thrashing them around a hallway with ease.

Multilingualism: Although his speech is primarily limited to the phrase "I am Groot", Groot is able to understand other languages.
Equipment
Weapons
Stormbreaker: Stormbreaker was an enchanted axe that was later forged by Groot once he used his arm to make the handle so that Thor could use it.

Trivia
In the comics, Groot is the monarch of the Planet X and his full title is "His Divine Majesty King Groot the 23rd, Monarch of Planet X, custodian of the branch worlds, ruler of all the shades," and the first alien to visit Earth as depicted in the mainstream Marvel Universe chronology.
In the first official trailer of "Guardians of the Galaxy", Groot was referenced in the Nova Corps database as a "humanoid plant inhabitant of Taluhnia."
According to James Gunn, offspring Groot has no memories of adult Groot from the first film.
Groot is a fan of The Jackson 5 and Electric Light Orchestra, as he is seen dancing to their music.
Behind the Scenes
James Gunn provided the motion capture for Groot when he dances in the pre-credits scene of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.
Vin Diesel recorded the line "I am Groot" multiple times for the film, using different intonations, inflections and moods to portray Groot. He even repeated the process in multiple languages so that his voice would be the one used in most translations of the film.
Many viewers have drawn similarities between the film's portrayal of Groot and the titular character from the 1999 film The Iron Giant, mainly due to both characters being portrayed by Vin Diesel and their supposed sacrifices in the films' climaxes, before revealing their survival at the end of the film.
Gunn originally meant to have Groot fully regenerated and adult in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, but this was changed because he found it too repetitive for the story.
Kevin Feige has stated prior to Vol. 2 releasing that Baby Groot is the same as old Groot, comparable to Spock's situation at the end of Star Trek III or for the whole of Star Trek IV.
Olaniyan Thurmon was a reader for the role of Groot in Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.
Ian Mitchell was a stand-in for Krystian Godlewski in the role of Groot.
