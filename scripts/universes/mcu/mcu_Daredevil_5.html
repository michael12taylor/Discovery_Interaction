A difficult battle took place as the unprepared and partially drugged Murdock fought against his attackers. Despite his weakened state due to the drug injection, Murdock managed to defeat his opponents and began heading toward the exist. As he reached another hallway, he was approached by two armored guards. Despite Murdock's plead for help, he realized that the guards were under Fisk's influence and immediately began fighting them.

After knocking out the guards, Murdock resumed his attempt to escape from the prison. As the prison began initiating a lockdown and the prisoners began rioting, Murdock was attacked by another inmate. After forcefully leading him to another room, it turned out that the inmates were working for Jusufi who was waiting for Murdock in the room. Jusufi demanded to know who Murdock was and why Fisk wanted him dead. Jusufi chastised Murdock's recklessness by coming to the prison by himself as Fisk still controlled half of the prison and the guards.

Murdock explained the situation to Jusufi about how he imprisoned Fisk and that Fisk went after Jusufi's gang. Murdock followed the clues to the prison because the Albanian Syndicate tried to kill Fisk in the prison. Jusufi clarified that he nor his men tried to assassinate Fisk while he was in prison. He explained that Fisk bribed someone to stab him to convince the feds, in return the attacker was freed from prison. Murdock managed to convince Jusufi that they have a common enemy in Fisk and he promised that if he helped him, Fisk will return back to prison. Agreeing to help, Jusufi ordered his men to disguise themselves as one of the guards, Jusufi told Murdock to find Jasper Evans, the inmate who stabbed Fisk and make sure their adversary return back to prison, otherwise he will come after him.

With one of the Albanian disguised as guard escorting him, Murdock traversed through now the rioting prison. Using his enhanced senses, Murdock aided his escort by warning him of approaching guards and which route to go. Managing to avoid the pursuing corrupt guards and fighting off the rampaging prisoners, Murdock's escort was able to lead him to the entrance where Murdock was guided out of the prisoner by other guards who weren't under Fisk's payroll. Protected by the guards as the rioting kept ensuing outside the prison, the guards opened the gate for Murdock. Once Murdock was out of prison, he managed to find his way back to the taxi that was waiting for him. Telling his driver to start driving, Murdock allowed himself to fall unconscious due to exhaustion and the drug finally taking effect.

Hours later, Murdock woke up to find a taxi still driving. Murdock asked his driver to stop, but to his horror, he discovered that this was a different driver, another agent of Fisk. Before Murdock could stop him, the driver jumped out of the taxi. The car was being driven toward the docks. Despite Murdock's attempts to leave, he found himself locked inside the cab. He was unable to do anything as the taxi drove off the dock.

Reuniting with Page
Murdock returning to his apartment
Murdock managed to survive, however, he quickly discovered that he was framed by Wilson Fisk as a criminal. Murdock returned to his apartment where he heard the FBI agents led by Ray Nadeem coming into his apartment which caused Murdock to escape to the rooftop. After the FBI left, Murdock returned to his apartment and changed into his black suit. He then went to Karen Page's home where he was met by Page herself.

Daredevil talking with Karen Page
Murdock explained the reason he stayed away from her and Foggy Nelson was to protect them from Fisk. Murdock then asked Page for help to find Jasper Evans which she initially refused. Murdock would later save Page from Evans and the two would take Evans to the Bulletin. Page also explained that she and Nelson needed him to turn himself in to the FBI so that he could have his name cleared. Murdock returned to the Clinton Church, where he would meet Maggie Grace who helped clean his clothes and the two would talk about Page.

Attack on the Bulletin
Daredevil confronting the new Fake Daredevil
Murdock met with Foggy Nelson at the New York Bulletin Building, however, while they were waiting, Murdock heard that someone was attacking the staff of the Bulletin. Suiting up, Murdock charged upstairs and found an assassin attacking and killing several staff members of the New York Bulletin while wearing his Daredevil Suit. Murdock arrived just in time to grab the billy club thrown at Nelson before it could kill him. Surprised by the arrival of this new adversary who was dressed in his Daredevil suit they both took a moment to observe one another. When Daredevil asked the imposter who he was, the impostor sarcastically replied that he was Daredevil. The two combatants immediately began battling on the office floor. At first, Daredevil immediately proved to be superior in close combat.

Daredevil is hunted down by Fake Daredevil
Despite the impostor's best attempt, he was unable to truly gain an edge over Murdock in hand-to-hand. Deciding to play to his strengths using his uncanny accuracy, Daredevil would go to cover as the impostor would throw objects at him this would prove effective against his opponent. Daredevil was distanced, with the impostor used everything he could find in the office and threw them at Daredevil with lethal intent. This would keep him on edge, with the fake Daredevil continuing to hurt him from a distance and forced to stay behind cover on the defensive.

As the fight kept escalating with Daredevil continuously trying to get in close and the fake Daredevil keeping the distance, Daredevil ultimately managed to get in close and once again overpower the impostor. Putting him in a sleeper hold. However, before he could be defeated, the impostor grabbed nearby scissors and pierced his opponent's shoulder. Daredevil then got a shelf thrown down on top of him and was kicked unconscious. When Murdock awoke up, he was forced to make his escape from the FBI who were still confused over what had happened and who was responsible.

Raid on Melvin's
Daredevil discovering another Daredevil's Suit
Following the massacre at the New York Bulletin Building, Murdock returned to the church to heal up and feeling angry and guilty he furiously explained to Maggie Grace that he failed to stop the fake Daredevil and save Jasper from being murdered. Grace, however, managed to calm and made him think: His Daredevil suit was a one of a kind and for someone else to be wearing an exact replica for it Fisk must have had someone make it for the impostor. Daredevil then sought out Melvin Potter who said goodbye to Betsy Beatty his parole officer. Daredevil was informed by Potter about the second suit. Daredevil was taken to Potter's new workshop who locked Daredevil in a cage with another copy of the suit, revealing that it was Fisk's plan to have him caught with the suit.

Daredevil broke free of the cage, however, and the two men fought as FBI SWAT teams closed in around them. Realizing their imminent danger the two men fought together against the heavily armed agents until Potter was cornered by several agents and their machine guns. Daredevil used this opportunity to escape and left Potter to be taken into custody for parole violation and assaulting federal agents while he cried out for Beatty.

Daredevil would meet up with Beatty informing her that she should leave New York because Fisk would be looking for her Beatty accused him of being no better than Fisk for using Potter for his own agenda. After warning Beatty, Daredevil headed to Ray Nadeem's house to warn Nadeem about Fisk and to inform Nadeem that the fake Daredevil is a man in the FBI.

Investigating Poindexter
Daredevil meeting with Ray Nadeem
Meeting with Nadeem the next day, Daredevil learned that the possible identity of the impostor is Benjamin Poindexter. Nadeem suggested that they headed to his apartment and look for clues to see if there were any ties to the attack on Bulletin. With Nadeem making sure that Poindexter stayed at the office, Daredevil and his new ally sneaked into Poindexter's apartment and began looking for clues. Inside, Daredevil caught the scent of the suit and thus confirming that Poindexter was the impostor.

However, without any concrete proof, Daredevil's claim was useless. They continued to investigate the apartment and Daredevil opened Poindexter's safe but found no presence of the suit except weapons and tapes. Eventually, Daredevil was alerted to the presence of Poindexter and he quickly retreated with Nadeem to the apartment above through the fire escape.

Above the apartment, they began discussing what to do with Poindexter. But before they could talk about it further, Poindexter shot them by ricocheting the bullets. With Nadeem injured by the shot, Daredevil urged his ally to escape. After making sure Nadeem left the apartment, Daredevil confronted Poindexter at the fire escape before he made his own escape. He deflected most of the glass pillars that his enemy threw at him before escaping to the roofs. While they didn't found any proof on Pointdexter, Daredevil managed to grab the tapes about Poindexter's therapy sessions.

Revelations
Returning back to the church, Murdock kept listening to the tapes as he continued his training. Murdock talked to Grace about Poindexter's past and his background resembled him. Murdock talked to the sister about his missed opportunities to catch him. Grace assured him that he did what he thought was right and he kept his promise to Nadeem to not hurt him. But Murdock bitterly replied that more people will die because of his decision. While Murdock trained, he heard about Grace's praying. As he trained, he heard Grace's prayers, in which she revealed that he was the son she sired with Jack Murdock. Murdock was shocked by the revelation that she was the mother he never knew, and that such a secret was kept from him.
