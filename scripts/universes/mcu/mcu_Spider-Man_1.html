Peter Benjamin Parker is a high school student who gained spider-like abilities, fighting crime across New York City as the alter ego Spider-Man, hoping someday, he will live up to his heroes in the Avengers. While Parker juggled all his continued superhero duties with the demands of his high-school life, he was approached by Tony Stark who recruited Spider-Man to join the Avengers Civil War, putting Spider-Man into the brief conflict with his personal hero, Captain America. Parker then agreed and was given his new suit as well as brand new Stark technology in exchange for all his help, although Stark still did not make him an official member of the Avengers and instead returned Parker back home to continue his own hero work.

While he continued to try and prove himself as a worthy hero in the eyes of Iron Man so he could join the Avengers, Parker then encountered all the illegal activities of Vulture, who was attempting to sell his Chitauri based weapons onto the black market. Believing that capturing Vulture would prove his worth as a hero, Spider-Man had decided to go after Vulture alone, with only Ned Leeds' assistance, while keeping all his secrets from Aunt May, gaining the affections of Liz Toomes, and also trying to win his decathlon finals. Eventually, Spider-Man had learned Vulture was Toomes' father and had then stopped his robbery of their Stark Cargo Plane, resulting in Stark offering Parker his place with the Avengers, which Parker turned down in order to continue being a small-time hero in New York.

Spider-Man was pulled back into the Avengers' conflict when the Black Order had invaded the Earth and then managed to successfully kidnap Doctor Strange, which resulted in Spider-Man being dragged onto their ship with Iron Man. Having then rescued Strange and joined forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man joined their attempts to prevent the Mad Titan, Thanos, from collecting the six Infinity Stones. However, the heroes could not defeat Thanos who then fulfilled his goal and then caused the Snap, resulting in the deaths of trillions, including Spider-Man's as he had turned to dust in Iron Man's arms. Having been dead for five years, Spider-Man was then resurrected when Hulk had managed to reverse the Snap, as Spider-Man rejoined their fight against Thanos, just in time to witness Iron Man sacrifice his life to defeat the Mad Titan.

The bereaved and traumatized Parker decided to take some time off his hero duties following Tony Stark's death, seeking refuge on his trip to Europe with all his classmates. However, despite wanting to focus his attention on winning the attention of Michelle Jones, Parker witnessed an Elemental attack and was recruited by Nick Fury to work with Mysterio to defeat the creatures. Once they had seemingly defeated these enemies, Parker handed over Stark's glasses to Mysterio, granting him access to Stark technology, only to discover that Mysterio lied to him. Recruiting Happy Hogan's help, Spider-Man followed Mysterio into London, exposing his illusions and defeated his former ally. However, upon his return into New York, doctored footage was sent to The Daily Bugle, which showed Mysterio exposing Spider-Man's true identity to the entire world as well as incriminating him for an alleged mass murder in London.

Biography
Early Life
Growing Up in New York
Peter Benjamin Parker was born in Queens, New York City on August 10, 2001. Since his childhood, the young Parker was raised by his loving aunt May Parker and uncle Ben Parker, the latter of whom died later in his life.

Battle at Stark Expo
Peter Parker challenges a Hammer Drone
In 2010, Parker visited the Stark Expo and acquired toy replicas of the Iron Man helmet and glove, as well as Tony Stark's autograph. During his second visit, Hammer Drones sent by Ivan Vanko began attacking the expo, prompting Stark, the host, to fight them as Iron Man. One drone had landed in front of Parker, who held his hand up in defiance and aimed his toy repulsor at the suit. Iron Man arrived shortly thereafter and annihilated the drone, thanking Parker for his help before flying off to continue his battle, leaving Parker awestruck.

Becoming Spider-Man
In his teens, Parker attended Midtown School of Science and Technology, where he quickly became best friends with his classmate Ned Leeds, but found himself deadlocked in a rivalry with Flash Thompson. Parker also became acquainted with Michelle Jones, who often seemingly teased him, and developed a crush on Liz Toomes, a popular girl who was two years his senior.

At the age of fourteen, Parker was bitten by a spider and acquired superhuman powers, including strength and speed proportional to that of a spider and an uncanny ability to adhere to walls. Resolving to use his abilities to help those in need, Parker developed his own synthetic web fluid and Web-Shooters to use when battling criminals in New York City as the masked superhero Spider-Man. To keep his identity as Spider-Man a secret, Parker maintained an unassuming lifestyle, refusing to join the football team or do anything he would not have done before.

Internet Sensation
Since beginning his vigilante and amateur superhero career, Spider-Man had caught the attention of various news organizations and reporters. Witnesses had filmed footage of his feats, such as subduing a thief and stopping a speeding car from hitting a bus, and they have posted said footage to YouTube and other video hosting sites. The video of Spider-Man catching the bus was also viewed on YouTube by Tony Stark, who then managed to discern his identity and looked into his activities.

Avengers Civil War
Recruited by Tony Stark
Parker returns home to find Tony Stark
One day in 2016, after Parker returned home from school, he greeted his Aunt May and made mention of a “crazy car” parked outside their apartment building. The presence of Tony Stark, his biggest idol, in the living room then caught Parker off-guard and left him speechless. Parker became confused when Stark told his aunt that Stark Industries planned to give him a sizable grant, claiming that Parker had signed up for it in the past, which he had not.

Parker watches online footage of himself
During a private conversation in Parker's room, Stark showed him footage of the rumored "Spider-Man" that was said to be active in New York City for several months. His videos showed a figure in red and blue clothing apprehending criminals and stopping speeding cars with his bare hands. Stark jokingly wondered if that figure was not Parker, to which Parker awkwardly denied the figure's existence, instead simply claiming that all of the footage had been edited.

Parker explains the origins of Spider-Man
Parker kept claiming that the video was fake footage that was made on a computer, but his cover was blown when Stark uncovered the makeshift outfit that Parker used as his costume hidden in a loft space. Parker had no other choice but to confess that he had been Spider-Man for six months. Stark ridiculed Parker for his cheap costume, but was impressed by, and complimented, the tensile strength of his web fluid and asked who had made it, to which Parker admitted that he had made it.

Parker is recruited to join Iron Man's team
Parker became defensive when Stark mocked the design of Parker's goggles from his costume, explaining that the goggles helped him focus his enhanced senses. When Stark wondered why he became Spider-Man, Parker, without going into detail, explained that he understood that he needed to stop bad things from happening. Stark invited him to come to Germany to confront Captain America, but Parker claimed he had too much homework to go out and join the mission.

Parker webbing Tony Stark to the doorknob
Ignoring Parker, Stark said that the mission could be dangerous and decided to tell May that he was taking Parker out on a field trip. As Stark walked toward the door, Parker overreacted for a moment and had used his own Web-Shooters to web Stark's hand next to the doorknob, ordering him not to tell May. Stark relented but after a brief silence, asked to be freed from his webbing. Embarrassed, Parker freed Stark's hand from the door awkwardly so he could leave as they then went to Germany.

New Spider-Suit
Parker films a video diary for his sudden trip
Parker was then escorted by Happy Hogan onboard Stark Industries Private Jet bound for Germany. While Hogan was driving him, Parker made a video throughout his trip which Hogan reminded him that he could not show it to anyone. When Parker tried to make conversation with Hogan by asking why people often called him Happy, he was ignored for the rest of the trip to the airport by the highly irritated Hogan.

Parker films his trip with Happy Hogan
When Parker arrived on the jet, he was amazed by all the cool features onboard, such as its need for no pilots as well as the fact that there were bathrooms located onboard the jet itself. When Parker sat down, Hogan was confused by all Parker's awkwardness, as he had never been on a plane before as he chose to sit down just across from him, noting he had never left New York City before. While Hogan slept on the jet, Parker videoed him, waking him up in shock.

Parker finally arrives in Berlin for his mission
When they arrived in Berlin, Parker explored the country video-logging everything without actually knowing why he was there in the first place, Parker was simply told that Captain America had now apparently gone crazy which was the reason why Iron Man had requested his help. When they arrived at the hotel, Hogan directed Parker to his room which was right next door to Hogan's own room, but to the delight of Parker and the irritation of Hogan. While at the hotel, Parker paid to watch an expensive movie, with the bill going to Hogan, who would suspect for years to come that Parker had watched an age-inappropriate film due to the price.

Spider-Man prepares to go on the mission
Having then been told to suit up to go onto the mission in just a few minutes, Parker then prepared for his upcoming fight with all of the rogue Avengers and put on his original suit and warmed himself up by filming himself in the mirror. Hogan soon walked in on Parker and, bewildered, asked Parker why he was not wearing the suit that Tony Stark made him, only for Parker to question what Hogan meant as he had not yet found anything from Stark in the hotel for him.

Parker is amazed by his new Spider-Man Suit
Parker, who was unaware of such a suit, then located the suitcase in another part of his hotel room and opened it, revealing the new suit and its features and upgrades which had been designed for him by Stark. Parker, speechless, put on the suit and joined Hogan who took him to Leipzig-Halle Airport, with Hogan showing no patience for Parker's excitement for the new upgraded Spider-Man Suit as Parker continued filming his reaction.

Clash of the Avengers
Spider-Man prepares to join in with the fight
While waiting for his cue from Iron Man to join the fight, Spider-Man secretly filmed and shortly narrated the standoff from some distance away, excitedly capturing Iron Man along with other members of the Avengers. While he was wondering who Black Panther was as he was currently standing alongside the Avengers, Iron Man then gave Spider-Man the cue to come out, much to his great excitement.

Spider-Man steals Captain America's Shield
Spider-Man quickly put down his phone and swung to the standoff, thereby stripping Captain America of his shield with his webbing while also binding Rogers' hands together. Spider-Man then gracefully landed on a tug, casually greeting everyone. He then quickly became distracted at the sight of the Avengers, who he idolized, much to Iron Man's annoyance since he told Spider-Man to stop talking and instead focus onto their mission. After saluting Captain America, Spider-Man looked on as Iron Man and Captain America continued to argue about the Sokovia Accords, keeping the shield so Captain America was at a disadvantage.

Spider-Man asking what he should do next
However, Spider-Man was surprised by Ant-Man, who had managed to sneak onto the shield and kick him in order to return it to Captain America. As the Avengers began to fight each other, Spider-Man asked Iron Man what he was supposed to do. Iron Man had told Spider-Man to keep his distance and use his Web-Shooters against Captain America and his companions, as he did not want to hurt any of them or Spider-Man himself during the fight against the Avengers.

Spider-Man battles against Bucky Barnes
Spider-Man then followed Falcon and Bucky Barnes in the airport terminal building by ascending onto and crawling along the outside windows, much to the great confusion of both. Spider-Man had then proceeded to smash his way through the glass and knocked Falcon to the ground with a hard kick, turning upon Barnes to stop his punch, though he became fascinated by his metal arm, calling it awesome, as Barnes was confused by the statement.

Spider-Man scraps against Falcon in the air
This momentary distraction allowing Falcon to tackle him and fly into the air while Spider-Man wrestled him, trying to insist that he would take Falcon into custody somehow as they continued to wrestle in midair. While Spider-Man swung through the airport terminal in pursuit of Falcon, he sensed Barnes had just thrown something at him, allowing Spider-Man to barely dodge out of the way before then throwing it back towards Barnes.

Spider-Man traps Falcon with his webbing
During a battle against Falcon, Spider-Man managed to use his webbing to damage the EXO-7 Falcon, causing Falcon to crash land before Spider-Man then webbed him up to some hand railings in the terminal building, but became distracted, this time by his wingsuit, as Spider-Man began wondering if they were made from carbon fiber as he had rambled about the sophistication of the harness, much to Falcon's irritation as he noted he should not talk as much.

Spider-Man beats Bucky Barnes and Falcon
As Barnes tried to intervene, Spider-Man was able to trap him and Falcon in his webbing, knocking them both onto the ground floor below, taking them out of the fight for the time being. As he began to apologize for their fight, Spider-Man was caught off-guard and was snatched away by Redwing, which grappled his leg and flew through a window, dropping him outside while Falcon and Barnes had then escaped the webbing while Spider-Man was gone.

Spider-Man running into battle with his allies
Unfazed by his defeat, Spider-Man rejoined his fellow teammates as they lined up against Captain America's own team in a brief standoff, with the Vision trying to divide the pair with a powerful beam which was fired from the Mind Stone. When the two teams began charging straight towards each other, Spider-Man had initially thought that Captain America's team would back down, but Iron Man noted that they would not back down from a fight either as they all began running.

Spider-Man swinging across the battlefield
As he charged into battle with the rest of his team, Spider-Man briefly fought with Wanda Maximoff as he fired his Web-Shooters at her while dodging the cars she threw back in return and evading Hawkeye's various trick arrows before Hawkeye had then ignored Spider-Man in order to fight against the Black Widow. Spider-Man then just swung across the airport dodging whatever Maximoff threw at him in an attempt to assist Iron Man's fight against the opposing team.

Fighting Captain America
Spider-Man confronts Captain America alone
As Spider-Man swung across the airport, he witnessed Wanda Maximoff saving Bucky Barnes from Black Panther before his webbing was cut as Captain America brought Spider-Man to the ground by throwing his shield at Spider-Man's webbing. The pair expressed their respect to each other while Captain America also asked what Iron Man had said about him.

Spider-Man trying to subdue Captain America
Spider-Man explained to Captain America that Iron Man had believed Captain America was wrong about his views on the Sokovia Accords and that made him dangerous. Spider-Man also explained that Iron Man had advised him to aim for his legs, which he did, using his Web-Shooters to trip Captain America and drag him across the ground before kicking him. Spider-Man attempted to subdue Captain America by webbing his arms and pulling him back, struggling against Captain America's strength.

Spider-Man is defeated by Captain America
With Captain America then quickly able to flip away from Spider-Man's grasp and threw Spider-Man away, Spider-Man still continued to try and subdue Captain America with webs. Eventually, Captain America was able to yank on one of the webs and threw Spider-Man towards him before hitting him hard across the face with his shield, forcing Spider-Man to retreat by leaping back, while Captain America continued asking what Iron Man had told Spider-Man about him.

Spider-Man attempting to hold up a platform
Seeking to end the fight, Captain America used his shield to damage the support beams of a platform, which fell and forced Spider-Man to hold it up. Captain America found Spider-Man's strength impressive and his heart genuine. As Captain America retrieved his shield and prepared to rejoin the battle, he asked Spider-Man where he was from, as Spider-Man then told he was from Queens, while Captain America was from Brooklyn before he had left the beleaguered hero behind.

Taking Down Giant-Man
Spider-Man updates the vlog during the fight
Once he concluded fighting against Captain America, Spider-Man once again picked up his phone and described what was transpiring during his scuffle, explaining how he had stolen Captain America's shield during their skirmish. However, while he was narrating to the camera, Spider-Man witnessed Ant-Man transforming himself into his giant form before grabbing hold of War Machine's leg in mid-air which briefly stopped the battle. Spider-Man shouted an expletive at the sheer disbelief of the sight he was beholden to.

Spider-Man during the Clash of the Avengers
Realizing that he had to go and help his team fight against Giant-Man, Spider-Man placed his phone on the ground, and cursed in amazement at the sight of Giant-Man towering above them all. When War Machine was thrown across the airport by Giant-Man, he was about to smash into an aircraft parked just outside, but Spider-Man saved him by firing his own Synthetic Webbing at War Machine and then pulling him away from the aircraft and swinging him back.

Spider-Man getting a lift with War Machine
While Captain America and Bucky Barnes used the distraction to attempt to escape by stealing their Quinjet from the nearby hanger, Spider-Man continued to fight against Giant-Man with the help of War Machine and Vision, unaware that this all was actually merely a distraction. While Spider-Man had then attached himself onto War Machine's armor with his webbing, he swung up and stuck his web to Giant-Man's arm, while using the momentum to kick him.

Spider-Man climbs on Giant-Man's face
Spider-Man then climbed onto Giant-Man's face and attempted to distract him by pressing himself against his goggles, but was forced to retreat when Giant-Man threw him off from his own face with his own gargantuan hand. Towards the end of their battle, Spider-Man was inspired by the movie The Empire Strikes Back and had come up with a strategy to defeat Giant-Man, although War Machine was also briefly mortified by realizing how young Spider-Man was.

Spider-Man manages to defeat Giant-Man
Spider-Man then proceeded to use his Web-Shooters and webbed up Giant-Man's knees so that he then lost his balance, and then let War Machine and Iron Man both fly up at full speed and strike him against the helmet with full power. As a result, Giant-Man fell over, hitting the now overly excited Spider-Man on the way down, making him fly into a pile of wooden boxes; knocking him unconscious for a short while on the battlefield as the fight continued elsewhere.

Spider-Man finally collapses after the fight
After the battle, Iron Man had told the exhausted Spider-Man, whose mask had come out of his face, that he was done and should now go home, threatening to call May Parker if he did not. Feeling like he had disappointed Iron Man, Spider-Man desperately tried to convince him that he could still keep fighting, but soon reluctantly agreed while Iron Man flew off to chase Captain America, and admitted he was indeed done as he lay down utterly exhausted from the fight on the floor.

Keeping the Suit
Parker tales the Clash of the Avengers
Once he was back in his hotel room, Parker filmed himself describing in excitement what had happened during the Clash of the Avengers, noting how Iron Man had called him into the battle and he had stolen Captain America's Shield before getting involved in the conflict. Before going on, he was interrupted by the arrival of Happy Hogan, who knocked on the door and informed him that he could hear him through the thin walls.

Spider-Man celebrates with all of his new fans
Unable to go to sleep, Parker then wore the Spider-Man Suit and left his hotel room via the window, and using all the rooftops, he quickly traversed all through Berlin until he got to a nightclub. Spider-Man, vlogging the entire experience, took pictures with the party-goers and used his Web-Shooters to swing around with female guests, taking every chance to celebrate the incredible experience. Spider-Man had continued partying before quietly returning back to the hotel. Parker also purchased and watched an adult video through the hotel's pay-per-view that night.

Parker is confronted again by Happy Hogan
The next morning, Parker got breakfast and enjoying being flirted with by a waitress when Hogan questioned if he had been out as Spider-Man. The unimpressed Hogan thrust a German newspaper in his face, which featured the photo of Spider-Man saving the Berlin chancellor, with the German media dubbing him as "Der Erstaunliche Klebrige Junge." Returning home from Germany, Parker and Tony Stark were driven by Hogan to his apartment in New York City. 

Parker is allowed to keep the Spider-Man Suit
Parker filmed Stark explaining to Aunt May that Parker had done an impressive job at the internship for Stark Industries, although Stark still could not resist making suggestive remarks about May while they were still filming. When they arrived home, Stark told Parker that he could keep the Spider-Man Suit, with Hogan keeping an eye on him. Parker returned home after Stark had given him some advice on how he should operate as Spider-Man for the foreseeable future.

Parker lies to Aunt May about the fight
Parker returned home, resting in his bedroom as May gave him an ice bag for his black eye, which he had gained when Captain America had struck him hard across the face with his shield during the battle. When May asked Parker who had injured him, he told her about a Brooklyn man named "Steve" and his huge friend. May then jokingly asked how he had done during the fight, hoping he had stood up for himself and Parker assured his aunt he got a few punches in himself.

Parker discovering his new Spider-Signal
When May had exited the room to leave him alone, Parker continued to inspect his new Web-Shooters designed by Stark Industries. When Parker accidentally pressed a button hidden underneath the devices, a bright red beam suddenly emitted from the Web-Shooter on his right wrist, projecting the Spider-Signal onto the ceiling — much to Parker's surprise and delight as he considered what his own future as Spider-Man would hold with Stark's backing behind him.

Back to Daily Life

Two months after the Avengers Civil War, Parker continued his daily life as a high school student at the Midtown School of Science and Technology.

Parker arrives back at Midtown High
Arriving at Midtown once he had taken the train across from New York City, Parker accidentally got in the way of Flash Thompson, who was driving his father's expensive sports car; Thompson immediately mocked him and called him "Penis Parker" as a way of greeting, which Parker ignored. Parker then walked into school through a sea of other students and made his way to his locker, where he put away his jacket and prepared for another day in his education.

Parker and Ned Leeds walking through school
Before classes began, Parker met with his best friend Ned Leeds, who invited Parker to build his new Lego Death Star. While highly excited, Parker claimed he could not join Leeds tonight as he instead had his internship at Stark Industries.

Parker then became distracted by Liz Toomes walking by as Leeds suggested he would come over later that night to work on the Death Star after making some headway on it.

Parker answers Monica Warren's question
During physics class, Parker watched clips of himself as the Spider-Man performing various heroic deeds to try and get a sense of the public's perception of him. However, Monica Warren noticed he was not paying attention and since Thompson had just failed to answer her question of determining linear acceleration on a pendulum swing between two points, she invited Parker to try. Parker took one look at the board and solved the problem, innately familiar with its concept due to his web-slinging. Warren complimented him, to which Thompson tried intimidating Parker.

Parker returns back to his normal school life
As he kept a close watch on the clock throughout the day, Parker then went to Cobbwell's lab, in which he was being taught Neils Bohr's discoveries regarding quantum theory. Parker had finished his lab early so he instead focused on upgrading his web fluid for his Web-Shooters. Parker secretly mixed the chemicals together in a beaker hidden in his class drawer to create the fluid, but discovered that it was forming much too fast and soon began to overflow over the beaker. Parker simply shut his drawer and continued listening to Cobbwell's lesson, while still keeping an eye on the clock to keep track of how long until he could leave school and be Spider-Man.

Parker and Ned Leeds admiring Liz Toomes
Over their lunch break, Parker and Leeds continued admiring Toomes from afar in the cafeteria, watching her as she put up a banner for the upcoming homecoming dance. As they discussed what top Toomes was wearing and if it was new or not, Michelle Jones interrupted and stated they were both creepy losers. Parker was confused and Leeds tried to turn the insult back on Jones, who calmly noted that she did not have any friends and therefore did not care about what they said.

Parker chooses to quit the decathlon team
Believing that Spider-Man would soon be recruited as an Avenger, Parker quit marching band and robotics lab to ensure his availability. He then told Roger Harrington that he would be unavailable for their school's academic decathlon team's Nationals in favor of his heroic activities which he covered up by saying it was for the Stark Internship. As Thompson questioned if Parker had ever even met Tony Stark in person, the rest of their team, particularly Toomes and Cindy Moon, expressed their shock that Parker would be quitting right before Nationals.

Parker defending quitting the decathlon team
After practice while eating with his teammates, Parker was forced to defend his sudden decision to quit the decathlon team as Toomes noted how little time there was before they went to Washington, D.C. for Nationals and Parker was their best player in physics. Although Parker tried to argue that they had Thompson to replace him, Abe Brown noted that everyone on the team preferred Parker. Parker then insisted that the decathlon would not do a physics challenge two years in a row.

Parker is personally confronted by Liz Toomes
As some decathlon members threw food at him out of annoyance for him quitting, Parker continued apologizing as he left the table. Toomes followed him down the hallway, assuring Parker that she understood the struggle of trying to juggle everything in his life, but suggested he could still come experience Washington with their team, who were counting on him. Parker continued to insist that he simply did not have the time, leaving Toomes disappointed.

Parker finally is allowed to leave the school
Having sat through several more classes within the Midtown Science School and became increasingly impatient to get outside, finally, the bell rang at quarter to three and Parker was able to leave.

Parker first stopped at Delmar's Deli-Grocery, where he greeted Delmar and bought himself a sandwich and gummy worms as an after-school snack. Delmar asked after Parker's aunt before saying in Spanish that May was a beautiful woman. Parker retorted in Spanish by asking after Delmar's own daughter. Delmar threatened to overcharge him for the sandwich, but Parker apologized, convincing him to sell for the original price. Parker then greeted Murph and paid for the sandwich.

Hero Duty

Thus every day after at Midtown School of Science and Technology, Parker made his way into the outskirts of New York City where he would soon find an empty alleyway to hide his school bag and don the Spider-Man Suit.

Not every heroics were successful, in one instance he webbed a man trying to get into his car, which he had mistaken for him attempting to steal the car.

Spider-Man gives an update to Happy Hogan
Desperate for something more exciting and meaningful, Parker kept trying to call and text Tony Stark through Happy Hogan but was continuously ignored by him. While taking a break for his attempts at heroics, Parker left a message on Hogan's voicemail in which he explained how he had stopped the bike thief and helped the old lady, hoping this would help get him into the Avengers so he could be a real hero at last and be able to make a real difference.

Bank Robbery

Later that night, Spider-Man spotted a small group of thieves attempting to rob an ATM.

When Parker revealed that Stark had made the suit for him, Leeds excitedly wondered if he was a member of the Avengers, to which Parker awkwardly claimed that he "basically" was. Following some more arguing, Parker managed to convince Leeds to keep his Spider-Man activities a secret from May, not wanting to cause any more distress for his aunt after the death of his uncle, which Leeds reluctantly agreed to. As Leeds left, he tried to ask Parker more questions about being Spider-Man, which an overwhelmed Parker promised to answer tomorrow at school.

Parker being bombarded with more questions
While they sat in their classes, including science and one lecture on the origins of the Sokovia Accords, Leeds continued pestering Parker with questions regarding his abilities as Spider-Man; such as how he gained his powers as well as other trivial matters which soon began to annoy Parker. As the questions continued, Parker ignored most of the questions as Leeds asked if he laid eggs, how far he could fire his Web-Shooters and if he could summon an army of spiders.
