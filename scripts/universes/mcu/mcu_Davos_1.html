Davos is a member of the Order of the Crane Mother, the son of Lei Kung and Priya, and the previous contender for the Iron Fist mantle. Davos later became friends with Danny Rand, but grew jealous of Rand once he received the honor of becoming the Iron Fist. Davos' jealousy turned to anger as Rand had left his post at K'un-Lun to return to New York City, as Davos had eventually turned against his best friend as he saw how Rand had changed while he was in New York, and his unwillingness to kill the Hand during their conflicts with Bakuto. Seeking the help of Joy Meachum, Davos chose to take revenge, by killing Rand for his decision to leave K'un-Lun and betraying him.

Having gained the corpse of the previous Iron Fist, Davos and Meachum hired Mary Walker to track down and kidnap Rand, using the Crane Sisters to perform a ceremony to transfer the power over to Davos, giving him the ability to channel his Chi to become the Immortal Weapon. Seeking to use the powers, as he believed it was intended, Davos had then recruited the aid of criminal Chen Wu and Ryhno's Gang to track down and murder members of the Yangsi Gonshi and Golden Tigers and anyone who associated with these organizations. However, as Davos was tracked down by Rand, who attempted to transfer the Iron Fist into Colleen Wing. Despite furiously attempting to keep his new powers, Davos was eventually overpowered and Wing took the Iron Fist from him, as Davos was arrested for all of his crimes, still vowing to get his revenge against Rand.

Biography
Early Life
Growing up in K'un Lun
Davos was the only son of Lei Kung, a revered member of the Order of the Crane Mother, and Priya. Growing up, Davos had always wanted to become next the Iron Fist and trained hard to achieve that goal. Davos' mother, Priya, would also push Davos to be the greatest warrior in K'un-Lun, allowing nothing less than perfection from him and scolding Davos if whenever dared to slack in this mission to become the Iron Fist. While growing up in K'un-Lun, Davos witnessed those who proved themselves to be dishonorable, being thrown to the bottom of the ravine, where Davos would walk among their corpses and then personally break all their bones for extra measure.

Meeting Danny Rand
Davos growing up alongside Danny Rand
One day, the monks Chodak and Tashi returned to K'un-Lun with an outsider named Danny Rand, since Rand was the only survivor from a plane crash on the outskirts of their hidden city. Rand then became apprenticed to Lei Kung, while Davos became close friends with the outsider and came to regard him as a brother, as the pair would often sneak away to eat a donkey together rather than vegetables. Being an outsider to K'un-Lun, Rand was able to show Davos some of his ways from New York City to amuse themselves, which had included making paper-airplanes, since these had utterly amazed Davos.

Davos playing games with Danny Rand
While inside their room, Davos and Rand had amused themselves by playing their game of noughts and crosses which Rand had learned while growing up in the United States of America, Davos once again lost and complained that it was a stupid game, as Rand bet Davos that if he won again then Davos would have to do all of his knuckle pushups for him, which Davos had simply refused to bet on, claiming that Rand was so skinny that he needed to do more pushups rather than him. Rand, however, noted how Kung taught them that having a sharp mind could be better than even the sharpest of swords.

Davos discusses becoming the Iron Fist
The friends then discussed the Iron Fist and the teachings of Kung and Yü-Ti, as Davos had noted that the Iron Fist must strike without mercy or hesitation, claiming that the Iron Fist not only guarded the pass to K'un-Lun but also killed them against all of their enemies. When Rand questioned if he would actually be able to kill, Davos had insisted that once he was the Iron Fist, he would then hunt down and destroy their enemies, which included the Hand. When Rand then questioned if Davos would be willing to kill him if he joined the Hand, Davos had claimed he would not as they were still brothers.

Davos is painfully punished by his mother
They were then interrupted by Priya, who insisted that if Rand joined the Hand then Davos must kill him without a second thought, telling Rand that he would never face Shou-Lao due to his compassion. Priya then whipped Davos' hands for speaking out of turn, making him recite what made him worthy of becoming the Iron Fist. The two youth shared many experiences together such as stealing wine from Master Kuo and replacing it with water as well as stealing apples from Master Q'uon or stealing Kuo's cart to go and peek on the village girls, only to find Davos' father bathing in the nude.

Seeking Iron Fist
Duel of K'un-Lun
Davos and Danny Rand prepare to duel
Years had passed and eventually, another trainee was chosen to go through Shou-Lao's trials and become Iron Fist, which Davos had trained for his entire life with the Order of the Crane Mother. Davos furiously fought against all the other challengers for the title in ritual combat, becoming victorious over them all one by one until only he and Danny Rand remained and were forced into combat with each other for the right to become the Iron Fist. The ceremony for their final fight was begun with Yü-Ti announcing that only one would be able to go and face Shou-Lao and have their chance at becoming the Iron Fist.

Davos preparing to challenge Danny Rand
Davos and Rand had worn their traditional karate gis and were given masks as they meditated before the fight. The two friends were then tied to one another by a long piece of cloth which would make their fight more of a challenge as each could use it to their advantage as either protection or their weapon. Lei Kung explained that neither of the fighters would be allowed to leave the room until one was finally victorious, noting that their fight would only end by yield or death. Davos and Rand then circled one another, eyeing up their opponent until Kung had then finally told them to begin their fight.

Davos and Danny Rand begin their duel
Without hesitation, Davos and Rand furiously charged at one another, fueled by their determination they each used all the skills they had learned in K'un-Lun in their duel, seeking to gain victory as soon as possible, but with them being equally matched, gaining an advantage proved to be challenging. Davos and Rand then each launched into the air at each other and landed a flying punch. Their duel continued for several hours, going into the night as neither fighter was able to fully gain an advantage and end their duel, as they took momentary pauses to calm themselves as the pain continued to increase.

Davos furiously battles against Danny Rand
Davos chose to be the more aggressive fighter, pulling at the cloth to bring Rand closer to him but struggled to land a finishing blow as Rand used his speed and fast reflexes to avoid all of Davos' strikes, attempting to tire Davos out. Using the long cloth to his advantage, Davos was able to pull Rand close to him as he attempted to land a deadly series of blows to Rand's neck which would cause a stroke, only to fail to pull off the move before Rand was able to knock him back, with Kung looking over at Priya upon seeing this, fearful that Davos would actually kill Rand finally to gain his victory.

Davos begins to lose control of his anger
Rand then used a similar technic as he used the long cloth to wrap up Davos' arms, making him unable to defend himself as Rand had landed a series of hard blows against Davos' face and body. Davos was just able to free himself by kicking Rand away from him while becoming enraged that Rand was coming so close to victory as he furiously tore the long cloth apart and roared at Rand to continue their fight without it. Their fight continued as Rand managed to knock the enraged Davos off his feet and then landed a heavy strike onto his chest, only for Davos to get up and still continue fighting.

Davos is soon beaten down by Danny Rand
With his anger getting the best of him, Davos received several heavy blows to the face from Rand that knocked him down onto his knees, forcing him to remove his mask while blood dripped from his open wounds. Seeing his friend in such a state of agony, caused Rand to momentarily pause before he would have landed the finishing strike, which Davos had then used to his own advantage by furiously hitting Rand in the face. Knocking him to the ground, Davos appeared to be coming close to victory as he had brutally slammed his foot down on Rand's fingers, crushing them as Rand screamed out in agony.

Davos demands Danny Rand yield the fight
As Rand lay in agony on the floor and struggling to move, Davos had then walked over to his brother and demanded that he yield the fight and allow Davos to claim a victory. When Rand said nothing, Davos began repeatedly hitting him in the head and demanding that he yield while Kung and the other monks watched on. As Rand said nothing, Davos gripped his hands around his throat and prepared himself to break his brother's neck. However, Rand was able to gather enough strength to throw Davos off him, wrapping up his broken fingers with the torn cloth and preparing himself to continue their duel.

Davos beating Rand down repeatedly
With the duel continuing into the early hours of the morning, Davos had now gained the clear advantage as he repeatedly hit Rand in the face, with both of them now covered in their own and each other's blood. As Rand could barely stand, Davos insisted that the fight was over and continued to demand that Rand finally yield the fight so that he did not have to kill his brother. Rand, however, refused to back down, blocking as many of Davos' strikes as he could but seemingly unable to land any counter strikes. As Davos insisted that he could not run forever, Rand claimed he was not running but leading.

Davos hesitates as he is blinded by the sun
This comment angered Davos, as he charged forward and attacked Rand, only for Rand to block the blows and move aside, allowing the bright sunlight of the early morning coming from the window to then momentarily blind Davos, at a crucial moment during their duel. This distraction for just a single moment, allowed Rand to use the energy he had been reserving and landed several hits against Davos, striking him across the cheek, stomach and under the chin before launching his flying punch directly to Davos' head, which knocked him down to the ground and left him completely unable to defend himself.

Davos hearing that Danny Rand has won
Since the advantage in the fight had finally come his way, Rand took advantage and grabbed ahold of the injured Davos, demanding him once again that to yield, and since he said nothing, Rand raised his bleeding fist, prepared to continue striking his brother until he finally yielded the duel to him. Before Rand could deliver one more punch, Lei Kung spoke out and told him that Rand would face Shou-Lao to become the Iron Fist. Davos was then left mortified and heartbroken that he had failed in his mission to become the Iron Fist, something he trained for his entire life, while Rand walked away victorious.

Mother's Scorn
Davos recovering from his injuries in his bed
In the wake of the Duel of K'un-Lun, the gravely wounded Davos had recovered in his room, where he considered the great shame he had bought upon his family by losing. He was eventually joined by Priya who had bought him his medicine and then informed Davos that Lei Kung was busy preparing Danny Rand for the Trial of Shou-Lao. Davos painfully sat up in his bed as Priya mocked him for the excuses which he would use, like Rand using the trick of the sun.

Davos' failure being mocked by his mother
Commenting that Davos might argue that Kung had betrayed Davos when he called the fight as he had never yielded, Priya insisted that these would merely be excuses for Davos' failure. With Davos unable to even look his mother in the eye, she told him that she would have rather been unable to bear children than have a disgrace like Davos as her son. Priya furiously called Davos second best and a fool who lost the right of the Iron Fist to a mere outsider rather than one born and raised in K'un-Lun and had therefore brought shame not only to K'un-Lun, but to his family who expected more of him.

Davos vows to finally make his mother proud
While Priya continued expressing her disgust that she was wrong in her belief that she had raised a champion, she smashed Davos' bowl of medicine before storming out, leaving Davos alone and filled with both shame and regret. Once he was alone, the mortified Davos said he was sorry to his mother and then vowed that he would make her proud, someday and somehow. Unsure of his own purpose in life now that he had just lost the right to face Shou-Lao and become the Iron Fist, Davos could now only sit alone and repeat to himself that one day, he would finally make his family proud of him again.

Danny Rand's Victory
Davos learns Danny Rand is now the Iron Fist
Davos had eventually recovered from all of the serious injuries which he gained in the Duel of K'un-Lun, and chose to accept the fact that he had been beaten by Danny Rand during their duel, choosing to withhold his disappointment and shame, instead supporting his own brother in defending K'un-Lun from the Hand because he had still regarded Rand as his brother. As Rand went to undergo the Trial of Shou-Lao, Davos personally went to check on him to see if he had survived the ordeal.

Davos helps the Iron Fist back onto his feet
When he reached the Cave of the Dragon, Davos soon found Rand unconscious outside the cave. Concerned for his friend, he went to check on him, fearing that Shou-Lao may have defeated Rand and claimed his life. However, as Davos checked on him, Rand suddenly awoke and in his confusion and panic, his fist started burning brightly with Chi, proving that Rand had succeeded in his trial against the dragon and had become the Iron Fist and the protector of K'un-Lun. Amazed that an outsider had succeeded where so many had failed, Davos helped Rand onto his feet as they headed back to the village, promising that he will stand by his side as his second.

Davos brings Danny Rand back to K'un-Lun
Davos had carried Rand all the way back to K'un-Lun, as Rand could barely stand following his furious duel against Shou-Lao which had almost killed him. When the brothers had then returned to K'un-Lun, Davos sat Rand down and watched as Rand lit up the Iron Fist, with both the brothers amazed that he had succeeded and become K'un-Lun's Immortal Weapon. For a time, both Davos and Rand guarded the passage together as Davos had acted as the Iron Fist's second in command, with Davos taking their role of guardians seriously, while Rand himself had still seemed distracted by outside thoughts.

Davos guards K'un-Lun with the Iron Fist
As they stood overlooking the passage to K'un-Lun, Davos and Rand discussed how this would be how they would spend the rest of their lives, protecting K'un-Lun. Suddenly one day, Rand left for New York City without any sort of word or trace, leaving K'un-Lun unprotected from any possible attack from the Hand. Davos had hoped Rand will eventually come back and continue his new role as their protector, but as time went by, that hope soon turned into disappointment and resentment for his friend's sudden abandonment, with Lei Kung also expressing his disappointment over Rand's disappearance.

Leaving K'un-Lun
Davos makes his decision to find Danny Rand
Ever since Danny Rand departed from K'un-Lun, Davos and all the other members of the Order of the Crane Mother debated what was to be done. Eventually, Davos made the decision to track Rand down himself, believing that he would have likely gone back to the United States of America to where he was born, New York City. As he prepared to leave to go after Rand, Davos first visited Priya, who was silently meditating as Davos had quietly knocked on her door.

Davos saying his final goodbye to his mother
Davos informed her of his decision, finding that his mother would not respond to him, which Davos assumed was due to her still feeling ashamed of him following his defeat in the Duel of K'un-Lun. Despite his mother seemingly ignoring him, Davos noted how he knew how much Priya had sacrificed for him to be a greater warrior. Davos also admitted that he knew there were many things that they struggled to communicate with each other. Davos acknowledged that he may never return home and invited her to speak to him, but found Priya said nothing, as Davos then left promising to make her proud.

War in New York
Retrieving Danny Rand
Davos finally arriving within New York City
Davos made his way to New York City to find and collect his brother, leaving K'un-Lun far behind him on his quest to return the Iron Fist to guarding the pass. Davos headed straight towards Rand Enterprises Building where his friend had reclaimed his name, finding it closed. While outside the building, Davos had then bumped into Harold Meachum, with the pair sharing a prolonged look at each other before Davos had then walked away to continue his search for Rand.

Davos being threatened by a food truck owner
Seeking a place to continue waiting for Rand, Davos walked inside a food truck where he was greeted by the owner, who mistook Davos for a rude customer and told him that he could order some food at the window rather than the door. When Davos had stepped inside the truck, the owner assumed that he was potentially attempting to rob him and proceeded to threaten Davos with a wrench while telling him to get out. However, without saying a word to the man, Davos was able to easily disarm and knock him out cold before he then calmly locked the door behind him as he waited for Rand to show up.

Davos waits for information on Danny Rand
Not wishing to draw any more unwanted attention to himself, Davos tied up the food truck owner and gagged him, while he looked at the man's copy of Forbes Magazine which also featured Rand's image on the front cover, as Rand had retaken Rand Enterprises since his return to New York, earning him billions of dollars as a result. In order to pass the time while waiting to catch a sight of Rand, Davos began making shurikens out of tin foil and then throwing them at the wall by the owner, who was terrified as the shurikens hit the wall inches away from his head, while Davos had calmly made his next one.

Davos watches as Bakuto takes Danny Rand
While Davos was still waiting and throwing more tin foil ninja stars, he caught sight of a guard leaving Rand Enterprises who had received intel that Rand was spotted in Chikara Dojo. Davos decided to follow him, in the hopes of locating the Iron Fist. Davos followed the man back to Chikara Dojo where he stood on the other side of the street and witnessed the now unconscious Rand being loaded into a car by Bakuto. Rand was joined by Colleen Wing while Claire Temple had insisted on going with them, however, Bakuto and Wing simply drove away with Rand with them. Davos watched the incident from across the street and followed, believing Rand to be in danger.

Fighting The Hand
Davos being reunited back with Danny Rand
Needing to confront Danny Rand, Davos then followed them and appeared at the Hand Compound, where he eventually encountered Rand who had just successfully battled against Bakuto, preparing to fight two other people. Davos ran to his friend's aid and managed to sneak up on two soldiers who were just about to attack Rand and quickly subdued them both. Davos chastised Rand for being the worst Iron Fist ever before advancing to the exit, leaving Rand calling out his name in disbelief, before soon following Davos.

Davos and Rand are surrounded by enemies
As they headed towards the exit with the alarms sounding, Davos then told Rand that Lei Kung had sent him to collect Rand and, when Davos questioned who was attacking them, Rand informed him that it was the Hand, much to Davos' horror. Davos vowed to kill as many of the Hand as he could just as they were cornered in a corridor on both sides. The two Order of the Crane Mother warriors responded by fighting against their enemies, teaming up to subdue them all before continuing to make their way towards the exit as quickly as they could before they could soon become surrounded.

Davos and Rand escape Bakuto's compound
Nearing the exit, Davos compared the task of stealing apples from Master Q'uon back at K'un-Lun. As they charged forward, Rand's path was blocked by his own former friend Darryl and, while he was distracted, Bakuto stabbed him in the side, leaving the wounded Rand in considerable pain. Davos responded by breaking Darryl's leg and pulling Rand away. At the gate, Davos demanded that Rand use the Iron Fist to bust them free, only to discover that Rand was now unable to while Bakuto explained that his Chi had been destroyed by his anger and confusion over all of his recent betrayals.

Davos fighting the Hand alongside Iron Fist
With no other choice, Rand and Davos charged forward and engaged Bakuto's army of Hand soldiers, using all their abilities to gain the upper hand against their more inexperienced foes. In a moment's break between the fight, Davos reminded Rand that he was going against their own plan as they then continued fighting against the seemingly unending Hand soldiers. However, Colleen Wing decided to betray the Hand and opened the gate in order to allow Rand and Davos to get away during all the chaos, as Davos subdued the last soldiers behind them with a hard punch to the head.

Davos begins furiously confronting Iron Fist
Having made it back to New York City, Davos noted that they needed to get Rand stitched up before they could return to K'un-Lun. When Rand had still claimed he would not be going back with him, Davos then confronted his friend over failing to keep guard over their home, noting that he clearly had no issue leaving them. Rand insisted that he needed to protect all of the people of New York, only for Davos to remind him that those people had tried to kill him before telling Rand he had failed in every way, noting Lei Kung was now the only person who could finally restore all of Rand's broken Chi once again.

Time in New York
Davos explains how he located Danny Rand
On the outskirts of New York City, Davos once again pushed Danny Rand to return to K'un-Lun with him, leading to Rand asking how Lei Kung had responded to him leaving the city, with Davos explaining he was confused and very pissed off. When Rand asked how Davos had found him, he told him he had followed them to the Hand Compound after he was taken from Chikara Dojo, also noting he found Rand in New York through the internet, showing off a video of Rand that had previously gone viral.

Davos reluctantly agrees to aid Danny Rand
Rand smashed Davos' phone, noting Bakuto may be able to track it before insisting that they must remain in the city for longer. Davos argued that the path to K'un-Lun would close soon, trapping them outside it, but Rand explained that the Hand had killed his mother and father in the plane crash years earlier which was why he had to stay. They argued about the Iron Fist's responsibilities, with Davos expressing his own great disappointment at not being chosen to be the one to face off against Shou-Lao. Eventually, Davos had agreed to help, provided they return home once the Hand was defeated.

Meeting Claire Temple
Davos being first introduced to Claire Temple
Seeking some medical aid for the wound that Bakuto had previously inflicted upon him, Davos and Danny Rand had then gone straight over to the Apartment of Claire Temple, with Davos referring to her as a healer while Temple questioned where Rand had been and what had happened as soon as she opened the door; however, when Rand showed her his bleeding injury, she immediately had then brought them inside for treatment in order to stop Rand's bleeding.

Davos goes to Claire Temple for some help
Temple took Rand inside and began treating his wound from where Bakuto had stabbed him during the previous Escape from the Hand Compound. Davos watched Temple as she pulled out Bakuto's blade and also recommended he heal himself with the Iron Fist, which had surprised Davos to learn that she had been told of his abilities. Davos complimented Temple on all her skills as a healer as she stitched up Rand's wound, but as Temple asked where Colleen Wing was, Rand asked Davos to make sure they were still safe as he told Temple the whole truth, leaving Davos frustrated over still not being included.

Davos has a conversation with Claire Temple
While Rand went onto the roof to restore his Chi, Davos stayed in the apartment to look after Temple as they discussed food and living conditions back in K'un-Lun, as Davos rejected Temple's offer to eat pizza with her. They discussed the concept of Chi as Temple had been studying it, with Davos explaining that the Iron Fist was granted to those who defeated Shou-Lao, something Temple found hard to believe as Dragons were still nothing more a myth to her, jokingly comparing the idea to Pete's Dragon, much to Davos' confusion as he did not know who Pete was, which had amused Temple.

Davos explains his intention for Danny Rand
When Temple had asked if Davos also had the Iron Fist, he explained there was only one, hinting at his disappointment that Lei Kung had chosen Rand over him to take the test, claiming that Kung had made a mistake. When Temple noted that Rand was only trying to do good and he belonged in New York City, Davos lost his temper, noting that the people of K'un-Lun and cared and raised him and he had simply betrayed them all by leaving without any warning. Davos managed to control himself and immediately apologized for his anger, noting that he would soon force Rand to return to K'un-Lun if he needed to.

Davos eating some pizza with Claire Temple
Temple collected her pizza and offered Davos a slice, which he had confessed to quite enjoying despite previously insisting that it would be poison for body and soul. They were joined by Rand who asked if Temple still had the iPad which he got in China, telling the pair they needed to take it to Harold Meachum and ask for his help, although Temple insisted he needed to think his plan through before charging forward. Rand insisted that he wanted was for the Hand to be done with before he would return to K'un-Lun, so Temple asked Davos to give them privacy, with Davos commenting about keeping guard.

Seeking Help
Davos being introduced to Harold Meachum
Seeking a new ally in their fight, Davos and Danny Rand then went to meet with Harold Meachum inside of his Penthouse. While Rand was greeted by Harold and Joy Meachum, Davos still waited inside the elevator until Rand invited him forward to be introduced to the Meachums, with Rand then introducing Davos as somebody else from K'un-Lun. Harold immediately asked if Davos also had the Iron Fist, only for him to be told that he did not, although Rand still insisted that he was a highly skilled warrior and willing to fight with them.

Davos discusses how to finally defeat Bakuto
Taking a seat, Davos then listened closely while Rand explained in detail about Bakuto's Hand Compound which Davos noted had too many Hand guards for them to fight alone. Harold, however, insisted they did not need to attack Bakuto, but would instead draw him out by attacking his money, noting he was taking Madame Gao's money from Rand Enterprises and putting it into his own accounts, therefore Joy could simply stop the transfer. Davos noted that Bakuto was still a skilled fighter but Harold insisted he would not be able to stop both Davos and the Iron Fist if it had come down to a final battle.

Davos demanding answers from Danny Rand
While outside Bakuto's base, Davos and Rand reminisced about their time in K'un-Lun, remembering the time they had accidentally come across Lei Kung meditating in the nude while attempting to see the women bathing. Davos and Rand had then discussed if he had been poorly chosen to be tested by Shou-Lao and becoming the Iron Fist instead of him, as Rand noted he got flashes of rage that damaged his Chi. Davos, however, argued that Rand going against Kung was the reason for his personal and emotional doubts. Davos confessed that he had always believed the Iron Fist was his birthright.

Davos watches Danny Rand and Colleen Wing
Davos began confronting Rand yet again about leaving K'un-Lun and abandoning his post, claiming he had stolen the Iron Fist from them. Rand confessed he had doubted himself from the moment he arrived at K'un-Lun and the moment he became the Iron Fist, telling Davos that while guarding the pass he saw a hawk which allowed him to leave, although Davos claimed New York City was not worth fighting for despite the strong connection which Rand clear had for it. They were interrupted by seeing Colleen Wing escaping the Compound, at which point Rand ran to her aid while Davos simply watched.

Davos furiously arguing with Colleen Wing
As they returned to New York, Wing explained that Bakuto had tried to kill her, although Davos insisted she could not be trusted as she was a member of the Hand, questioning who she was to Rand. To Davos' horror, Wing made it clear she knew who he was although Wing had insisted she would never harm Rand, which Davos did not believe due to his hatred of the Hand. Davos suggested destroying the compound, but Wing refused to save her Chikara Dojo students, claiming that they were not actually bad people but that they had just been misled by Bakuto's teachings where he had lied to them.

Davos questioning Danny Rand's motivation
Davos claimed Wing was simply trying to seduce the Iron Fist into the Hand before committing on how he had broken her own students during their escape from the compound earlier. All these torments eventually led to Wing furiously punching Davos directly in the face as Rand got between them as a fierce argument broke out, as Davos insisting that it was the duty of the Iron Fist to destroy the Hand and if Rand was unwilling to do it, then he would. When Rand promised they would all destroy the Hand together, Davos claimed New York had confused him and was the cause of him losing his Chi.

Fighting Bakuto
Davos becomes more frustrated at Iron Fist
While at Chikara Dojo, Davos told Danny Rand that he and Colleen Wing were both seemingly losing the focus on their battle just before Rand got a call seemingly from Ward Meachum. Much to his horror, the caller was in fact Bakuto who had taken the Meachum family hostage, even shooting Joy Meachum in the gut. Bakuto then demanded that Rand come and surrender or he would kill all the hostages. Although Davos insisted Rand could not surrender to Bakuto, he ignored his advice and left, much to Davos' annoyance.

Davos furiously fighting against Bakuto's men
As part of his plans to rescue the Meachum family against all Davos' wishes, Iron Fist allowed himself to be captured by the Hand, while Davos and Wing waited for him to walk Bakuto into their trap. Once Iron Fist freed himself by briefly regaining him Chi, Davos and Wing charged forward, with Davos throwing knives and immediately killing two of the Hand soldiers before fighting another in the brutal one on one duel. Davos had eventually got into a knife fight with the soldiers, losing his own blade while keeping his enemy's knife away from his own throat. Davos managed to break his foe's arm and even stabbed him in the side, but the fight continued as he had refused to yield.

Davos gaining the upper hand during the fight
Having wrestled the man onto the floor, Davos attempted to strangle him to death, finding that the man had continued to try and get free. Eventually, Davos finally regained his knife and managed to plunge it into the Hand soldier's heart, finally killing him. Meanwhile, Wing and defeated her enemy while Rand had managed to gain the upper hand against Bakuto, who was now without any back up to protect him. Seeing that he was clearly outmatched by them all, Bakuto chose not to fight and instead ran through New York City while the three chased after him, refusing to allow Bakuto to get away with his life.

Davos and Rand watching Bakuto's final fight
Davos chased down Bakuto with the other three until they cornered him in Central Park. Bakuto challenged his former student Wing to be the one to battle him, noting that Iron Fight and Davos were both true warriors trained with the Order of the Crane Mother, while Wing was nothing more than the teacher of children at Chikara Dojo. As Bakuto and Wing began fighting with their katana swords in the rain, Davos noted to Rand that he must not intervene, as Bakuto was Wing's old sensei and therefore this was her fight to win, even when it appeared that Bakuto was gaining the upper hand against Wing.

Davos stabbing Bakuto through the heart
Eventually, Wing defeated Bakuto by stabbing him into the stomach but refused to land the finishing strike against him, instead of wishing to hand him over to the New York City Police Department. Davos was mortified at this, noting that it was still their duty as warriors to kill a leader of the Hand, not have him arrested. While Bakuto had begun mocking Rand, claiming this was never his father's intention for him and the Iron Fist was merely a weapon for K'un-Lun, Davos insisted they honor their mission. Seeing Rand was not willing to, Davos then stepped forward and had stabbed Bakuto through the heart.

Duel Against Iron Fist
Davos furiously calls Danny Rand too weak
With Bakuto finally lying dead from Davos' final fatal strike, Davos then insisted that Danny Rand was failing at his mission by not killing a leader of the Hand as they had been trained to do, claiming that he was clearly not the warrior that he was expected to be, as it was still the duty of the Iron Fist to destroy the Hand, not have the New York City Police Department arrest them and put them into cages like he was planning on doing with Bakuto. When Colleen Wing had insisted that it was not that simple, Davos had yelled out that she did not have a say in the matter, while Rand defended her from him.

Davos having his fight against Danny Rand
Davos noted that if Chodak and Tashi had never found Rand in the mountains following his plane crash, then maybe K'un-Lun would have been better off. Enraged by this, Rand turned and attacked his friend, as they began using all their training to defeat one another. As Davos managed to knock Rand back, he furiously accused Rand of choosing the people of New York City who he had despised over the people who had raised him up back at K'un-Lun. Although they were mostly evenly matched, Rand eventually managed to gain the upper hand and furiously demanded that Davos finally yield the fight.

Davos being finally defeated by the Iron Fist
Refusing to give in easily, Davos continued fighting until Rand pinned him down and again demanded him to yield, noting how he had defeated him before back in K'un-Lun and that he had just managed to do the same here. When Davos attempted to get back up, Rand harnessed his Chi and threatened him with the Iron Fist. Rand then told Davos that while it was selfish and wrong of him to leave without warning, he had now learned that the Iron Fist should not only be for K'un-Lun, as he could do good within New York, insisting that he was both Danny Rand and the Iron Fist as Davos then yielded.

Davos vows to get his revenge on Iron Fist
With the fight over, Rand allowed Davos to get back up before telling him that he only wishing Davos could understand what he was going through. Davos, however, told his former friend that he would never be able to understand all the choices Rand had made with betraying their home, instead of telling him that he only knew that the path to K'un-Lun was now open and there was no Iron Fist protecting them from future attackers. Having told Rand that consequences would be upon him, Davos turned and walked away, disgusted by all of Rand's actions as he not only betrayed K'un-Lun but their friendship.

Betraying Iron Fist
Alliance with Joy Meachum
Davos makes his alliance with Joy Meachum
Sometime later, Davos had left New York City and traveled to Tibet, and on the way back he met up with Joy Meachum in Paris as they discussed Danny Rand's recent return back from the dead and how that effected their lives since. Davos stated that Rand becoming Iron Fist had changed him, and Davos also reasoned that Rand destroyed everything that he touched, including Meachum's own life. Davos then offered to help Meachum kill Rand, which Meachum had seemed to be open to. Meanwhile, Madame Gao was also sat nearby, listening closely to their conversation.

Arrangements with Yang
Davos arrives at Red Hook Pier for a meeting
Seeking to gain his revenge, Davos attempted to gain possession of the body of a previous Iron Fist for his upcoming ritual to steal Danny Rand's power. Having learned that Orson Randall was the man who had access to the body, Davos had then made a deal with the Yangsi Gonshi to have this transported to him from Randall. When Davos was told there was an update, he then went over to the Red Hook Pier, finding all of the workers quickly moved aside.

Davos during his meeting with Hai-Qing Yang
There Davos had met with Hai-Qing Yang, the leader of the Yangsi Goshi, who informed Davos that although the shipment was still on its way there, the price for transporting it had just gone up, which greatly annoyed Davos as he reminded Yang of their original deal which they had already agreed on. Yang had then explained that the Golden Tigers were attempting to take control of the docks, putting the shipments at risk of being blocked by customs and told Davos that the price had gone up to four million dollars in order to ensure that the shipment would be safe from the Tigers sabotaging it.

Davos is personally insulted by Hai-Qing Yang
Annoyed, Davos told Yang of how in K'un-Lun, all those who broke their word were put to death by having their bodies thrown into a deep ravine where Davos would then break their bones to ensure their deaths, which had resulted in Yang's own men stepping forward and threatening Davos while armed with their hatchets, now ready to strike him down if he dared make a move against Yang. Seemingly outnumbered, Davos told Yang that he would discuss the deal with Joy Meachum before preparing to walk out of the docks while greatly annoyed that Yang would dare change their deal without warning.

Davos gives Hai-Qing Yang a stern warning
Before he could leave, however, Yang told Davos how his wife would claim that these docks were a cautionary tale about fish becoming other peoples meals. Believing that Yang thought that he was weak for agreeing to this deal, Davos used the martial arts skills which he had learned with the Order of the Crane Mother to brutally kill two of Yang's men in mere seconds, taking their hatchets and cutting their throats. With that, Davos warned Yang that if he ever raised the price for their deal again, then his own family and business would suffer the consequences before Davos then walked out of the docks.

Updating Joy Meachum
Davos discovers Joy Meachum drinking alone
Following the tense meeting with the Yangsi Gonshi, Davos went to meet with Joy Meachum at her new Apartment to update her on the situation. Meachum offered Davos the glass, but he noted he did not drink and regulated his own diet to ensure his body was at peak physical perfection. Davos then informed Meachum that Hai-Qing Yang changed the price, as Davos complained that his connection with Yang as well as New York City itself was a plague upon him.

Davos explaining Hai-Qing Yang's betrayal
While Davos continued to complain about how sickened he was by New York, Meachum had simply teased him by commenting on their traffic jams which she had claimed were also a nightmare to be dealt with. Changing their subjects, Davos had then noted that Meachum seemed upset while she was drinking her wine and questioned what was wrong, as Meachum then explained that Danny Rand and Ward Meachum had been there, noting how difficult it was to look Rand in the eye due to what they were planning for him, referring to their plan to steal the Iron Fist from Rand's body and give it over to Davos.

Davos questioning Joy Meachum's strength
When Davos questioned if this experience of manipulating Rand was something she had enjoyed, Meachum noted that she did at first, but Rand had stayed behind and had actually been kind to her, although Davos still referred to Rand as a fool. Davos questioned if Meachum had been wavering with her belief with the current mission, to which Meachum turned around to Davos and still insisted that she was not, and instead was simply drinking. With his concerns with Meachum's commitment to the cause, Davos had turned and walked out without another word, to focus on completing his dealings with Yang.

Reunion with Iron Fist
Davos being finally reunited with Danny Rand
Wishing to see his face to face, Davos went to Chikara Dojo where he then waited for Danny Rand to arrive so he could confront him over everything that had happened. Eventually, Rand had arrived alongside Colleen Wing, as Rand expressed his great surprise at seeing Davos there and questioned where he had been, to which Davos simply answered that he had been in New York City. Rand then questioned why Davos had not reached out to him at any point while he had been in New York, to which Davos had simply claimed that it simply had not been the right time.

Davos asks to speak with Danny Rand alone
As Rand claimed that there was a lot they needed to talk about, Davos mentioned K'un-Lun and noted how their home was gone due to Rand walking away from them as Davos once again insisted that if Rand had come back when Davos told him to then the Order of the Crane Mother would not have been slaughtered by their enemies. Rand insisted that he had his reasons for staying in New York, to which Davos noted that one was allying with a soldier of the Hand, pointing to Wing. Before a clash could start, Davos then insisted that he and Rand now had family matters that they needed to discuss.

Davos and Danny Rand discuss recent events
Davos asked to speak with Rand alone as they left Wing at Chikara Dojo as Rand noted that a lot had happened since they last saw each other, noting that New York was now his home. Davos noted that Rand had inherited Rand Enterprises from his father and was, therefore, a rich man, although Rand insisted that his focus was not on money but protecting New York. This comment angered Davos as he noted that Rand had not protected K'un-Lun, although Rand insisted that he had destroyed the Hand by defeating Alexandra Reid and Bakuto, to which Davos noted that K'un-Lun had paid the price.

Davos furiously confronting Danny Rand again
Although Rand continued trying to argue that he had done what he thought was right, Davos was getting considerably more annoyed and questioned if he had ever listened to what Lei Kung had taught him. Davos then struck Rand in the chest, reciting Kung's teachings to them while Rand insisted that Davos needed to stop what he was doing before catching Davos' next blow before he could hit him yet again, telling Davos that he did remember all Kung's teachings. Still quoting Kung's teachings, Davos then attempted to land a furious series of strikes against Rand, letting his anger get the better of him while Rand was still able to block most of Davos' strikes.
