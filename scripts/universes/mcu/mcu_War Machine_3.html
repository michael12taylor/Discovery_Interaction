<html><p>Upon arrival in Wakanda, Rhodes and the Avengers were greeted by King T'Challa and his Dora Milaje. As they got off the Quinjet, Rhodes was asked by Bruce Banner if he should bow in front of T'Challa, to which Rhodes told him that he should as T'Challa was the King. When Banner actually bowed and T'Challa told him not to, Rhodes grinned to himself having tricked his friend before they had followed behind the Avengers.

Rhodes sees Dropships heading on Wakanda
While Captain America spoke with T'Challa and Shuri about how they intended to remove the Mind Stone from Vision without killing him, Rhodes put on his Mark IV and awaited the battle. Before long, War Machine witnessed the arrival of the Outrider Dropships, which had exploded upon hitting Wakanda's protective shields above them all. Although the Winter Soldier had expressed his joy at seeing this, War Machine notice that more were landing just outside the shield.

Battle of Wakanda
War Machine flying towards their next battle
With the Outrider Dropships surrounding Wakanda, War Machine and the Avengers prepared themselves for the battle as War Machine flew alongside his allies and joined the line up of Avengers, Dora Milaje and Border Tribe, who readied themselves for the battle. War Machine stayed back as Captain America and Black Widow had joined Black Panther while they had confronted the Black Order who were stood just outside Wakanda's shields, awaiting the battle to begin.

War Machine drops bombs onto the Outriders
As Proxima Midnight ordered the battle to begin, War Machine had witnessed thousands of the Outriders charging towards the shields, furiously clawing at the heroes, ripping themselves apart as they all forced their way through all the shields. Needing to keep their battle controlled, Black Panther ordered Shuri to open the shields, allowing the Outriders to charge towards them, while War Machine dropped several bombs onto them, killing dozens with a massive fireball.

War Machine fighting the armies of Outriders
With the armies of Outriders pouring into Wakanda and then fighting against all of the Avengers and Wakandan soldiers, War Machine had stayed high above the ground and fired every weapon that he had on his Mark IV, causing massive explosions. However, War Machine was struck out the sky when Cull Obsidian launched his Chain Hammer at him, causing War Machine to crashland. Just as the battle seemed to be lost, Thor returned through the Bifrost Bridge, beside both Rocket Raccoon and Groot, as Thor had then furiously joined the battle.

War Machine and Falcon fighting a Thresher
With Thor fighting alongside them, War Machine and his allies were able to hold back the Outriders, as War Machine and Falcon joined forces to destroy one of the Threshers that Midnight had sent. Before long, the Outriders had seemingly all been destroyed, while Midnight had been killed by Wanda Maximoff and Bruce Banner had destroyed Obsidian. However, Vision was now in harms way once again as yet another threat was looming over the heroes, despite their victory.

Thanos' Victory
War Machine attempting to destroy Thanos
While all the Avengers had begun to regroup, they had then suddenly witnessed a Wormhole opening up in the center of Wakanda, as they watched in complete horror as Thanos then personally stepped onto the battlefield. Once he had arrived in order to finally obtain the Mind Stone from Vision, War Machine and his allies then attempted to stop him, determined not to allow him to win as War Machine had then furiously unleashed the full arsenal of his Mark IV's weaponry against the Mad Titan.

War Machine being crushed by Thanos' power
However, despite the powerful weapons at his disposal, War Machine still proved to be completely outmatched by Thanos' skill with all the powers of the nearly completed Infinity Gauntlet, with Thanos using the Space Stone to crush his War Machine armor around him before throwing him aside. With War Machine unable to continue the fight, he witnessed the other Avengers also being defeated before Thanos had brutally ripped the Mind Stone from Vision's head, killing him.

Rhodes questions what happened to his allies
Once Thanos had obtained the Infinity Stones, he proceeded to snap his fingers and caused the Snap, which then wiped out half of all living organisms in the universe. Once Thanos had escaped, Rhodes had then called out to Sam Wilson, just as Wilson disintegrated to dust, along with trillions of others across the Multiverse. Shocked by the death of his allies, Rhodes was just able to ask Steve Rogers what happened, out of disbelief and despair before they began to lament the loss.

Meeting Captain Marvel
Rhodes giving Steve Rogers another update
Following the failure of the Battle of Wakanda, Rhodes, alongside the surviving Avengers, returned into their New Avengers Facility. Having discovered the Transmitter Pager in Atlanta that had been reactivated by Nick Fury prior to his death, the Avengers successfully bypassed all of the pager's battery in order for it to continue sending out its signal. Rhodes personally monitored the pager and had informed Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff that the pager had stopped transmitting the signal.

Rhodes keeps watch on the Transmitter Pager
As Rhodes and the others looked it over to try and understand what had happened, Rogers had requested that they attempt to reboot the pager and resend that signal, only for Bruce Banner to respond that they had no idea what the signal was for. As Romanoff explained that Fury knew whom the signal was for, and she wanted to know who it was as well, she came face to face with Captain Marvel herself, who had then demanded the Avengers tell her where Fury was.

Rescue of Tony Stark
Rhodes witnesses Tony Stark's return
After explaining to Captain Marvel that Tony Stark was missing in space, she went in search of him. Captain Marvel soon returned, so they all came out where they saw her land a ship outside the New Avengers Facility. Rhodes watched as Stark exited the ship along with Nebula.

Rhodes tries to calm down Tony Stark
As the whole group all went back inside the facility, Rhodes witnessed the three being informed by the affects of the Snap. Rhodes stood by his friend as he recovered, listening to the discussion about stopping Thanos by needing a team to unite together. However, once things started to get heated between Stark and Steve Rogers, Rhodes held back his friend, trying to get him to calm down as he had goes at with Rogers. After Stark gave his Arc Reactor to Rogers, Rhodes witnessed his friend collapse, before telling him that he was fine.

Rhodes questions Carol Danvers on her plan
Due to his weak state and rejection of help, Stark fell to the ground and immediately fainted. Helping his friend get back to recovery, Rhodes then moved Stark to a bed where Bruce Banner gave him a sedative. As Rhodes informed the rest that Stark would be out for the rest of the day, Danvers then went to kill Thanos. However, they stopped her, informing her they should work as a team, which Rhodes added if she even knew where to find him.

Ambush on Thanos
Rhodes learns about the Garden from Nebula
Once Nebula revealed that she knew of Thanos' location, they all then gathered, where they were informed by Nebula of the Garden, the place Thanos planned to go after he succeeded, which Rhodes mocked as Thanos' retirement plan. Rocket Raccoon then updated them on another usage of the Infinity Stones, which they tracked down the planet Nebula was referring to.

Rhodes discusses the plan against Thanos
After Carol Danvers suggested they just go an steal the stones from Thanos, they all began to discuss the next course of actions, which Rhodes was cautious of, as Thanos still possessed all of the stones. When Danvers reassured the plan by stating that they had her, Rhodes questioned her absence from Earth all this time. Danvers noted that she had a responsibility to a multitude of other planets that did not have the Avengers protection, which Rhodes accepted.

War Machine and Nebula arrive at the Garden
After agreeing upon the mission and suiting up to go face the Mad Titan, the Avengers joined forces with Rocket, Nebula, and Captain Marvel, and boarded on the Benatar. Once they took off to Planet 0259-S, Rocket asked the Avengers who hadn't been to space before, which a confused War Machine put his hand up to, as Rocket stated that nobody should vomit before traveling. They then made their jump through space, arriving at Planet 0259-S where Captain Marvel went to do recon. When she returned, she informed them that it was only Thanos on the planet, which Nebula stated was enough.

War Machine restrains Thanos' right arm
Captain Marvel made the first move, bursting into Thanos' hut, placing him in a headlock. Bruce Banner in the Mark XLVIII armor quickly joined her, restraining the Infinity Gauntlet, with War Machine joining him by holding Thanos' other hand. Thor then arrived and sliced off Thanos' left arm with Stormbreaker, severing the Gauntlet. The others then joined them in the hut, where Rocket turned over the Gauntlet, revealing that the stones were gone.

War Machine is disquieted by their failure
They then demanded Thanos to tell them the location of the stones, but he revealed that he had destroyed them, seeing them with no other purpose but temptation. However, War Machine did not believe him and desperately suggested they tear the hut down to find the stones. But, Nebula assured them that Thanos, albeit many things, was not a liar. In anger, Thor then cut Thanos' head off and left, while everyone else was frozen in the horror of their failure.

Searching for Clint Barton
The new lineup of the Avengers
After their failure to reverse the Snap, everyone went their own way, with Rhodes staying with the Avengers, now being led by Natasha Romanoff with Carol Danvers, Rocket Raccoon, Nebula and Okoye apart of the team. They set out to help Earth, amongst other planets recover after the galaxy-wide incident.

Rhodes during a meeting with the Avengers
After learning about what Clint Barton had been doing after his family died, Romanoff assigned Rhodes with tracking him down in hopes to help him. In 2023, Rhodes would find himself in Mexico after learning of a Massacre in Mexico that he concluded Barton was responsible for. Despite everything he had seen while serving, Barton's actions scared Rhodes to the point where he doubted if they should even find him, thinking he had gone too far.

Rhodes updates Natasha Romanoff
One day, the Avengers gathered for a meeting to update Romanoff on what they had been doing. Rhodes stayed silent as the others talked to Romanoff, waiting to update her on Barton privately. Once the meeting concluded, Danvers, knowing that Romanoff would not like what Rhodes was going to say to her, wished him luck. Rhodes and Romanoff were then left, so she asked where he was, which he told her he was in Mexico.

Rhodes expresses his fears about Clint Barton
He told her about the Mexican Cartel that had been brutally murdered, which Romanoff tried to dismiss as just a rival gang, but Rhodes assured her it was Barton. This then led him to try and bring up to Romanoff his thoughts on not finding Barton, but she would not allow it. Romanoff did not want to let her best friend continue to lose himself, so she begged Rhodes to keep searching. Rhodes continued his search, until he was able to track Barton to Tokyo, where he would go after the Yakuza.

Time Heist
Time Travel
Rhodes returns to the New Avengers Facility
After Scott Lang returned and presented the idea of travelling through time to steal the Infinity Stones, and Tony Stark achieved the method to do so, the Avengers were all called in to help. Rhodes flew back to the New Avengers Facility, where he was notified by Nebula of Lang being in the landing zone, so Rhodes landed very close to him, startling him. He then went inside after teasing Lang about his abilities.

Rhodes attempts to calm Scott Lang down
Once all the Avengers were assembled, including Thor and Clint Barton, they began working on the method in order to travel through the Quantum Realm. While they worked on the Quantum Tunnel, Rhodes watched as Bruce Banner and Nebula fitted Lang with the Advanced Tech Suit, which he was impressed by. When Lang started getting unnerved about the scarcity of the Pym Particles, Rhodes told him to calm down. But, Lang was not confident in following through with the test.

Rhodes suggests killing Thanos as a baby
Barton then volunteered to test time travel, so they then started to prepare him in the suit. As they did, Rhodes brought up the idea of going back in time and killing Thanos as a baby, much to Banner's shock, which he later explained couldn't work. He explained that changing the past does not change the future, despite the common belief.

Rhodes argues Time Travel with Bruce Banner
However, Lang and Barton supported Rhodes' idea, and when Banner asked where they were told this could work, he and Lang listed an array of films that featured time travel, which Rhodes concluded made it known. Banner strongly objected this, and proceeded to explain to him that if you travel to the past, that past then becomes your future, which could not be changed by the new future.

Rhodes watches Clint Barton test Time Travel
They all then went to the hangar to watch the test, with Barton being the first to travel through time in a controlled manner. They stood together, as Barton stood on the Quantum Tunnel while Banner prepared to send him through the Quantum Realm, into the past. They then watched as he entered the Quantum Realm, and after some time, witnessed his return, learning that they were successful in achieving time travel.

Creating the Plan
The Avengers beginning the brainstorming
With the means of stealing the Infinity Stones accounted for, the Avengers then moved their focus on the when and the where. They all gathered in the common room, where they began their brainstorming. They started with Thor, who they noticed was asleep, which Rhodes quipped as him being dead.

Rhodes and Clint Barton listening to Thor
When Thor awoke, he told them about the history of the Aether, explaining its origins and his encounter with it during 2013, as it fused itself with Jane Foster. However, after the mentions of Foster, his mother and his home, Thor began to go off topic, as he was not in a stable state, not being able to deal with loss. Rhodes watched as Thor derailed, sharing concerning looks with Clint Barton.

Rhodes is informed about the Tesseract
That night, as they all ate dinner, Rocket Raccoon informed them about the Power Stone, and how Peter Quill stole it from Morag. Afterwards, while everyone did their own thing, Rhodes and Steve Rogers went over the Space Stone's history. As Rogers explained to Rhodes his encounter with the Tesseract during the 1940s, Rhodes then took the chance to ask him why he had to crash with the Valkyrie, which Rogers didn't respond to.

The Avengers complete their brainstorm
Eventually, they completed the brainstorm and had set out the Time Heist with three teams: Rhodes, Nebula, Natasha Romanoff and Barton going to 2014 to steal the Power and Soul Stone, Tony Stark, Rogers, Bruce Banner and Scott Lang going to 2012 to steal the Space, Mind and Time Stone, and Thor and Rocket going to 2013 to steal the Reality Stone.

Theft of the Power Stone
War Machine prepares to travel through time
The Avengers then suited up and put on the Advanced Tech Suits and made their way to the Quantum Tunnel to commence the Time Heist. Steve Rogers gave a speech to motivate them before the mission, as Bruce Banner activated the machine. They all then traveled to their designated times and places, knowing that they only had one chance.

War Machine and Nebula on Morag in 2014
War Machine, Nebula, Black Widow and Hawkeye arrived on Morag in 2014, where they enlarged the Benatar given to them by Rocket Raccoon so the other team could travel to Vormir to steal the Soul Stone. War Machine helped Nebula guide the Benatar’s space pod to the ground, while Black Widow and Hawkeye jokingly rushed them, which War Machine stated was not helping. He then said goodbye to the two, telling them to look out for each other as they took off on the Benatar.

War Machine learns of other threats in 2014
Now just he and Nebula, War Machine reconfirmed the plan of just waiting for Peter Quill to show up so he would lead them to the Power Stone, but Nebula advised they take cover, as they weren't the only people looking for the Infinity Stones at that time. War Machine asked who else would be looking for the stones, which she revealed that her father, Thanos, her sister, Gamora, and even herself were, causing him to ask where her past self currently was.

War Machine knocks Peter Quill unconscious
They then hid behind some rocks until Quill arrived, where they watched as he danced around, which War Machine commented on him being an idiot, much to Nebula's agreement. War Machine then punched Quill, knocking him out, allowing Nebula to steal his tool to let them open the doors to the Temple Vault. 

War Machine and Nebula at the Temple Vault
However, when Nebula went to enter, War Machine stopped her, using his knowledge of films to be cautious of traps that could kill them. However, being unaware of what he was talking about, Nebula proceeded into the vault, to no harm. They then reached the Orb's shielded display, where Nebula reached through and pull it out, burning her robotic hand.

War Machine and Nebula are successful
She handed him the Orb, and still carrying emotional pain from her alterations, told War Machine that she wasn't always a cyborg, which he revealed his similar situation of being paralyzed. He then told that they work with what they have, and the two shared a bonding moment through their differences from others. They then went to return to the present, but instead of syncing up, War Machine ended up leaving alone, unaware to him.

Blip
Rhodes successfully returns to the present
The Avengers, unbeknownst that Nebula had been replaced by her past self, all returned to the present. They all celebrated in their success of stealing the Infinity Stones, with Rhodes surprised that the mission actually worked. However, it was cut short when they noticed Clint Barton return alone, realizing that Natasha Romanoff had died.

Rhodes jokes about Thor's current state
After mourning the death of their friend, they began working on the Nano Gauntlet, so they could wield all the stones to bring everyone back. Once they completed it, the discussion then became about who should wear the Gauntlet, which Thor immediately volunteered for. However, everyone spoke up against him doing due to his unstable state, with Rhodes joking that he was filled with Cheez Whiz.

War Machine and Ant-Man awaiting the snap
However, Bruce Banner told them that it had to be him who snapped his fingers, as he was the only one who could possibly survive it. Everyone then suited up and stood around Banner and watched as he put on the Gauntlet. They watched as the power of the stones affected Banner, but he was able to snap his fingers, causing him to collapse. They all checked on him, unsure if they were successful. Suddenly, the facility was attacked by an airstrike from the Sanctuary II, as Thanos had been brought to the present by past Nebula.

Attack on Avengers Facility
Rhodes falls under the New Avengers Facility
The attack destroyed the facility, causing the Avengers to become separated as they fell under the rubble. Rhodes, Rocket Raccoon, and Bruce Banner fell in the same spot, trapped under the rubble, where Banner was struggling to keep the building from falling on them.

Rhodes and Rocket Raccoon under rubble
Rhodes' suit then malfunctioned, so he activated the emergency eject, freeing him, but rendering him unable to walk. He saw Rocket trapped under rubble, suffocating him, so he used his weight to lift the rubble off him, as they both attempted to get their breath back. However, despite Banner's cries for them to save themselves, they were unable to go anywhere. Suddenly, a flood of water came through and began to fill up the area.

Rhodes and Rocket Raccoon near death
As the water rose, Rhodes attempted to call out for help, but was not able to get a response. When the water was reaching their necks, Rhodes farewelled Rocket, accepting their fate of drowning. However, Scott Lang rushed to their location and was able to save them all from drowning. Lang then provided Rhodes with another suit allowing him to walk and help fight in the ongoing battle outside.

Battle of Earth
War Machine rejoins the fight against Thanos
War Machine, Ant-Man, Rocket Raccoon, and Hulk joined the restored Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Masters of the Mystic Arts, Wakandans, Asgardians, and Ravagers to face alternate Thanos and his army. Captain America called on the Avengers to assemble as the two opposing armies then charged at each other and fought.

War Machine flying towards Thanos' army
War Machine, with Rocket riding on him, fought Thanos' army trying to prevent them from obtaining the Infinity Stones. During the battle, when Thanos ordered an airstrike, War Machine protected Hulk from the attack by moving him away from the blasts, until they were all saved by Captain Marvel. As the battle reached its conclusion, Iron Man then stole the stones from Thanos and snapped his fingers, causing Thanos and his army to disintegrate.

War Machine comforts a dying Iron Man
War Machine spotted Iron Man, who was resting due to the power of the stones completely overwhelming his body. War Machine landed before him, and comforted him, holding his head, understanding that this was Iron Man's final moments. They then shared a moment in silence together as War Machine stayed with his best friend, as other heroes arrived around them. They were joined by Spider-Man and Pepper Potts, tearfully witnessing Stark dying from his injuries caused by the resulting cosmic blast.

Rhodes and the Avengers mourn Tony Stark
After the battle, a funeral was held for Stark at his home, where Rhodes, along with Potts, Morgan Stark, Happy Hogan and the remaining original Avengers watched a prerecorded message from Stark. When it finished, they went outside and watched as Potts and Morgan put Stark's Arc Reactor in the lake. Rhodes stood next to Hogan, and the two comforted each other over the loss of their best friend, along with everybody else that had survived the battle.

Life Goes On
Captain America Tribute
Rhodes listening to Sam Wilson's speech
In 2024, Rhodes attended a ceremony at the Smithsonian Institution where Sam Wilson handed over Captain America's shield to the U.S. government. Rhodes watched as the shield was placed into the glass case and taken to Captain America's exhibit.

Rhodes and Sam Wilson viewing the exhibit
After the ceremony, Rhodes met with Wilson and the two walked into Captain America's exhibit. Rhodes told Wilson that the world was in chaos following the Blip and asked why he gave up the mantle, to which Wilson replied that he felt it was someone else's. Rhodes told Wilson that they would be in touch and left the exhibit.

Personality
James Rhodes is a highly distinguished officer of the United States Air Force. Though he is supportive of his best friend Tony Stark and generally enjoys being involved in his revelries, he is sometimes annoyed by Stark's flippant and reckless behavior. Rhodes was upset at Stark's decision to stop weapon manufacturing, although he chose to aid Stark to defeat Obadiah Stane by preventing the Air Force's involvement. However, shortly after Stark officially became Iron Man, his disrespect of government officials and refusal to relinquish his armors to them placed Rhodes in a difficult position since he has to balance his responsibilities to his superiors and respect his friendship with Stark, forcing Rhodes to side with the government and steal the Iron Man Armor: Mark II. As liaison to Stark Industries, Rhodes strives to maintain a copacetic relationship between Stark and the United States government.

As a military man, he is a firm believer in people being held responsible for their actions and a proper chain of command. This made signing the Sokovia Accords an easy decision for him as it would make the Avengers accountable for their actions, reduce the collateral damage, and have an improved reputation. As a result of this, he fought those who believed their actions to be "right" and would flout the law to accomplish them, shown when he confronted Captain America's faction during the Clash of the Avengers. However, as time progressed, Rhodes became increasingly frustrated with the restrictions imposed on the Avengers, as well as Thaddeus Ross and the United Nations labeling his friends as criminals so much so that he chose to receive a court-martial when Ross demanded Rogers and his team arrested despite there being an imminent threat approaching Earth.

For the most part, Rhodes maintains a sense of professionalism and strives to do whatever he feels is the right thing for the American people. This often causes tension between him and Stark, though the two nonetheless maintain strong mutual respect and friendship. Rhodes also takes great personal pride in his work; when attending the party following the retrieval of the Scepter, he enjoys getting laughs from recounting stories of his work as War Machine, and his ego is somewhat deflated when he doesn't get the reaction he's looking for from Stark and Thor. Despite becoming partially paralyzed as a result of siding with Stark against Captain America over the Sokovia Accords, he freely admits having no regrets, as he believes it was the right thing to do. This would in time change, as he later openly admitted his disappointment and frustration that the Accords had ultimately done more harm than good by fragmenting the Avengers, forcing many of them to live in hiding in a time they were needed. After the friendly fire incident that left him paralyzed, he also held no animosity against Captain America and his team.

Despite his sense of professionalism, however, he enjoys wearing the War Machine suit and is largely disappointed when it underperforms, such as when the Ex-Wife Missile installed in his suit did not work when fighting Whiplash. Though he states that being rebranded as Iron Patriot comes across well as it was less aggressive, he secretly prefers being referred to as War Machine and quickly goes back to this persona following the end of Aldrich Killian's War. However, he is often left in awe when faced with more extreme super-powered individuals; the sight of Aldrich Killian breathing fire alone was enough to make him immediately surrender despite actually winning against his men, and when preventing several Ultron Sentries from fleeing was left wondering what he had just witnessed when Vision did his job for him.

Powers and Abilities
Armor Capabilities
Like Tony Stark, Rhodes has no known superhuman powers. He is a military man who is in excellent physical condition. However, like Stark, Rhodes' power comes from using a modified Iron Man Armor re-designed by the Hammer Industries to become War Machine. The armor allows him to fly, possess superhuman strength and durability and contains various weapons for battle. Rhodes' armors are more devised for military-oriented purposes; therefore they are more heavily armored and weaponized than Stark's armors.

The War Machine armors are the only other powerful suits next to the Iron Man armors. Before weaponization of the Mark II Iron Man armor, it was sufficient enough to battle a more updated Mark IV Armor. When the Mark II Armor was transformed into the War Machine Mark I armor, it was sufficient enough to nearly overpower the Mark VI (while under Ivan Vanko's control), battle hordes of Hammer Drones and Vanko himself with his own armor.

Support Powers
Superhuman Strength: When utilizing the armor, it increases Rhodes' natural physical abilities to superhuman levels, chief among them is his strength. Rhodes, inside his armor, is capable of overpowering normal humans and tear unmanned battle drones with ease. It also allows him to go toe-to-toe with Stark in his armor. By his own claim, Rhodes can lift a tank with his armor. He could also knock out the half-Celestial Star-Lord with a single punch, and restrain one of Thanos' arms.
Superhuman Reflexes: The armor, like Stark's, has motors for movement. It is extremely fast and responsive in flight, and during combat, as armor can react faster than naturally possible.
War Machine flying after Captain America
Flight: The armor, like the [[Iron Man Armor, can reach speeds as Mach 3 in moments. It is equipped with non-weapons grade repulsor based flight stabilizers that theoretically reach speeds of Mach 8 similar to the Mark IV's flight stabilizers. It was adequate to keep up with the Mark VI during the battle over the Stark Expo and catch Iron Man off-guard and tackled him into the Oracle building.
Armor Systems: The armor has remote assistance, and a holographic HUD, with cellphone and computer connections in the helmet. The armor is powered by a miniature arc reactor and has an onboard generator for emergencies. The scanner systems are capable of scanning the environment, weather conditions and equipment for information. The armors also have variable control surfaces for active flight control. The Hull Pressure Transducers are onboard sensors that track external pressure based on altitude, speed, and temperature and adjust internal settings appropriately.
Self-Contained Life-Support System and Environmental Protection: The armor can be sealed for operations in vacuum or underwater, providing its own life support, and is shielded against radiation, even being able to sustain Rhodes in the Quantum Realm.
Built-In Walking Aid: After being paralyzed in the Clash of the Avengers, all War Machine armors, starting with the Mark IV, have walking aids in them that allow the semi-paralyzed Rhodes to walk.
Defensive Powers
Superhuman Durability: The armor is made of a solar-charged carbon-composite-based external plating armor and has a chest plate protecting the Arc Reactor. It is shown that it can withstand tremendous amounts of punishment. It had withstood a full-on fight with the Mark IV in Tony Stark's house. It had withstood the full-on fight with the Hammer Drones and withstood the full-on ammo unloaded on both him and Stark while in their respective suits. It was able to withstand the damage done on it by the Whiplash in his own suit. It protects the wearer from the effects of extreme g-forces. During the Clash of the Avengers, his armor resisted being at the epicenter of an explosion, Falcon's weapons, Ant-Man's fists, being thrown into an airplane and Captain America's shield all with no damage. It was vulnerable, however, to the power of the Mind Stone, the blasts shearing off the arc reactor and causing it to plummet several hundred feet. However, the armor was durable enough to remain intact following the crash and allowed Rhodes to survive his fall, despite being severely crippled and nearly killed. In response to this accident, later armors were made even more durable, giving improved protection to both Rhodes and the arc reactor.
Offensive Powers
Repulsors: A particle beam weapon in the palm gauntlets that can repel physical and energy-based attacks. When combined with an attack from another repulsor, it can create an energy shockwave that decimates a small area like when he and Iron Man both fired their repulsors at each other and the resulting event destroyed much of Stark's mansion.
Unibeam: A more powerful version of the palm repulsors mounted on the chest. In addition to the physical capabilities and various weaponry it already possesses, it also utilizes laser-guided munitions.
Mini-Gun: A 7.62-mm minigun is attached to the back of the suit on a swivel mount and typically fires over the right shoulder. It is governed by an automated targeting system and can track targets independently of the suit's wearer, including those targets to the rear. The ammunition feed for this weapon is a belt feed from the rear torso.
Gauntlets: The armor's arm braces each mount an underslung sub-machine gun.
War Machine firing down upon the Outriders
Rocket Launcher: A box rocket launcher mounted over the left shoulder holds a Hammer Industries rocket bunker-busting Ex-Wife Missile designed by Justin Hammer; however, the particular Ex-Wife loaded at the time of the Battle at Stark Expo was faulty and consequently proved useless against Whiplash.
Miniature Stark Sonic Cannon: It can emit sound waves that will stun the target for weeks. Rhodes has only used this twice, once on a group of the Ten Rings, and once on Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man.
War Hammer: A baton Rhodes used to incapacitate targets by releasing powerful, non-lethal electricity.
Abilities
Gifted Intellect: Rhodes wears a "Brass Rat", the MIT school ring, indicating that he and Stark were graduates of the same college, and on his other hand, he wears a Air Force Academy ring, suggesting that he received his Master's Degree from MIT after earning a "grad school slot" for high academic achievement while at USAF Academy.
Expert Tactician: He can create strategies that help him win in a battle. During his and Tony Stark's attack on Aldrich Killian, Rhodes was able to deflect several attacks from Extremis Soldiers with pure strategy. He also played a key role in fighting and coordinating strategy during the Battle of Wakanda.
War Machine fighting the Hammer Drones
Expert Combatant: Rhodes' military training made him a very skilled fighter. He was more than able to handle himself against Extremis Soldiers, even punching Eric Savin to the ground with a single punch, as well as also managing to, while wearing the Mark II Armor, compete against and eventually best Stark in their ferocious brawl during Stark's birthday when Stark got drunk while he was wearing his Mark IV Armor.
Expert Marksman: Rhodes' military training gave him a large knowledge of firearms and how to use them. This enabled to him to shoot multiple Extremis Soldiers with one gun.
Expert Pilot: Rhodes is a highly decorated United States Air Force officer and as such, he is a skilled fighter pilot as he is able to pilot the War Machine armor.

Weapons
Ex-Wife Missile: Rhodes took weapons from Justin Hammer including "Hammers greatest invention"- the EX-Wife Missile. Later, Rhodes attempted to use it while fighting Vanko, but it failed.
Beretta 92FS Inox: Rhodes took a handgun from one of the guards at Aldrich Killian's Mansion when he managed to escape from capture despite having lost the Iron Patriot Armor. He used it to kill some guards inside the mansion, to threaten Trevor Slattery and to confront many Extremis Soldiers during the Battle on the Norco.
Walther P99: Rhodes kept one of these handguns beside him during the party at the Avengers Tower, resorting to use it against the Iron Legion drones hijacked by Ultron.
Stark Sonic Cannon:  During the Clash of the Avengers, Rhodes used the weapon to take down Scarlet Witch.
Other Equipment
Arc Reactor: To be added
Rhodes attempts to adjust to his new braces
Leg Braces: When both of Rhodes' legs had been completely paralyzed during the Clash of the Avengers, Rhodes was given new Stark Industries leg braces designed by Tony Stark which would enable him to walk again. Although Rhodes initially had trouble using them, over time he had gotten used to them and could walk normally again. Following The Battle of Earth the braces have been redesigned so that they can now be worn under his unifrom.
Transmitter Pager: An ordinary pager modified by Carol Danvers using Kree technology for use as an instrument of last resort in extreme emergencies. Nick Fury was eventually forced to use it in response to the Snap before it was found by the Avengers.
Advanced Tech Suit: This suit was designed in order to time travel through the Quantum Realm safely. It is a white, red and black suit that materialize around the wearer's regular clothes, managing to be summoned when time travel is required again, and disappear when no longer in use. It has size-shifting adaptability down to subatomic levels and a wrist gadget that allows for displacement through time and space.
Plasma Sphere: During an alternate timeline in 2014, Rhodes took Star-Lord's Plasma Sphere on Morag to illuminate the Temple Vault.
Orb: To be added
Vehicles
Stark Industries Private Jet: Tony Stark charted his private jet for him and Rhodes to arrive at Afghanistan where they organized a presentation of Jericho missile for the United States Air Force. During the flight, both Rhodes and Stark drunk too much and get distracted by stewardesses who had danced around a stripper pole.
Humvee: Following the presentation, Rhodes and Tony Stark were going to leave the place in the Humvee, but Stark told Rhodes to take another one. However, his Humvee was attacked by the Ten Rings who killed all soldiers and kidnapped Stark.
Benatar: In order to confront Thanos, the Avengers took the Guardians of the Galaxy's spaceship to fly to the Garden. During the Time Heist, the Benatar was used by Rhodes and Nebula to arrive at Morag and acquire the Power Stone.

Edwards Air Force Base: As the officer within the United States Air Force, Rhodes was stationed at the Air Force base in Lancaster, California. During the lesson for the airmen, Rhodes met Tony Stark who asked him for assistance with his new project. However, Rhodes refused. Following his clash with Stark, Rhodes took his Mark II Armor and delivered it to the Edwards Air Force Base where it was remodeled by Justin Hammer into War Machine Armor.
Tony Stark's Mansion: To be added
United States Capitol: To be added
Avengers Tower: Since the Avengers successfully took HYDRA down and acquired the Scepter, they organized a party which was attended by Rhodes as well. Rhodes was telling the stories about his missions to Thor, Steve Rogers, and other guests, as well as attempting to lift the Mjølnir with Tony Stark. However, the Avengers were attacked by Ultron, so Rhodes had to protect non-combatants from Iron Legion while the others were fighting Ultron.
New Avengers Facility: When Rhodes officially joined the Avengers, he was stationed at their new headquarters in Upstate New York, together with Vision, Wanda Maximoff, and Sam Wilson. Following the dissolution of the Avengers, Rhodes stayed at the facility, cooperating with Thaddeus Ross who was concerned about Captain America and his allies, before Rogers recruited him to fight Thanos. After the battle, Rhodes and the Avengers returned to the facility where they planned the operation to acquire the Infinity Stones from an alternate timeline. However, as soon as Hulk resurrected the victims of the Snap, the facility was destroyed by the Sanctuary II.

Trivia
In the comics, James Rhodes is a 1st Lieutenant within the United States Marine Corps who was eventually rebuilt as a cyborg, due to his injuries, though his brain was later transplanted into a healthy cloned body.
In Iron Man 3, Rhodes is known as the Iron Patriot. In the comics, the identity of Iron Patriot was firstly adopted by Norman Osborn. After the release of Iron Man 3, for a time, the mainstream counterpart of Rhodes has also taken the mantle of Iron Patriot in the comics, before later going back to the War Machine armor.
Rhodes has to change his password every time Tony Stark hacks into his profile; at least once, his password was WARMACHINEROX.
War Machine is the only Avengers member that is not an original founding member to remain alive after the Snap.
War Machine is the longest-serving Avenger, having joined in 2015 and having an uninterrupted service until the team disbanded in 2023, due to signing the Sokovia Accords and being a survivor of Thanos' Snap.
Behind the Scenes
James Rhodes is one of the few characters who is played by different actors in different films. The others are Howard Stark, Bruce Banner, Fandral, Thanos, Red Skull and Cassie Lang.
In an unused draft of Iron Man, Howard Stark featured as still alive, a ruthless businessman and the main villain, who adopted the identity of "War Machine".
A War Machine movie was nearly greenlit at Marvel Studios, with Joe Robert Cole as a writer, but the plan was changed after Iron Man 3.
Don Cheadle was uncredited for his appearance in Captain Marvel.
Some of Spider-Man: Homecoming concept arts featured War Machine and Vision taking part at the rescue of the Staten Island Ferry alongside Iron Man, a concept that did not make it to the final version of the movie.
An initial idea for Avengers: Endgame involved War Machine becoming Vice President of the United States of America in the aftermath of the Snap.
Clay Donahue Fontenot was a stunt double for Terrence Howard and Kiante Elam, Kevin Arnold, Kevin L. Jackson, Trevor Habberstad, Kierron Quest and Greg Rementer were stunt doubles for Don Cheadle in the role of War Machine.
Patrick Emery was a stand-in for Terrence Howard and T.J. Hogan and Nev Smith were stand-ins for Don Cheadle in the role of War Machine.
