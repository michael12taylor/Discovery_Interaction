<html><p>When asked how he encountered Meredith Quill, Ego revealed that he met her after having decided to explore Earth, and asserted that he knew Quill was his son after having heard rumors of a hero under the name "Star-Lord" absorbing the Power Stone during the Battle of Xandar against Ronan the Accuser. Later, she interrupted Mantis and Drax with the former having been about to say something possibly about Ego. She grew suspicious when Mantis displayed uncertainty and fear.

Gamora dances with Peter Quill on Ego
She danced with Quill with the latter trying to get her to admit that there was something between them- something she denied. Gamora expressed her suspicions, but Quill accused her of being jealous of his 'half-god' status and demanded to know why she couldn't be happy for him having found his family. Gamora responded that she already thought he had found his family before storming off.

Showdown with Nebula
Gamora being ambushed by Nebula on Ego
Gamora meditated outside in one of the fields, considering whether or not Ego was an ally or enemy. However, her meditation was interrupted by a commotion coming from an M-Ship piloted by Nebula. Gamora then sprinted away from the ship, hoping to evade her sister and reach safety. However, Gamora was shot at multiple times and was chased into a series of caverns. During the pursuit, the M-Ship was destroyed.

Gamora viciously fires upon Nebula's ship
Using her strength, Gamora pulled Nebula out of the destroyed ship which was in flames. Before Nebula could seize her opportunity to finally kill Gamora, the ship exploded sending the two sisters flying onto the ground. Although the two struggled, the two sisters fought with each other. A shocked Gamora then yelled to Nebula that she saved her life, only for Nebula to continue her kill mission. Nebula attacked Gamora, and ultimately choked her, but didn't kill her and let her go.

Gamora is finally defeated by Nebula
Gamora coughed and regained her strength as Nebula expressed excitement at the fact that she finally bested Gamora in combat. Gamora, however, insisted that she saved Nebula's life and the match was unfair and therefore she did not truly beat her in combat. Nebula was angry at Gamora for always winning the fights Thanos made them partake in that resulted in Nebula being continuously 'upgraded' every time she lost.

Gamora and Nebula discover the skeletons
Gamora then listened as Nebula claimed to have only wanted a sister, stating that Gamora was the only true family she possessed while serving under Thanos. Following their fight, the two formed an uneasy alliance. Exploring the caverns, they came across a large pile of bones, which confirmed Gamora's suspicions about Ego from earlier. As they observed the bones that belonged to Ego's children, Nebula warned her that they should leave the planet.

Gamora attacks Mantis
The two ran back to the main palace to warn Peter Quill. Instead, Gamora and Nebula found Mantis conversing with Drax. Gamora furiously attacked Mantis, demanding to know who they were and what Ego's intentions were until the latter touched her causing her fear to become more prevalent with Drax assuring that Mantis had told him everything. The five of them concocted a plan to save Quill.

Battle on Ego's Planet
Gamora attempting to rescue Peter Quill
The four went to save Quill who was being attacked by Ego before a ship piloted by Yondu Udonta and Rocket Raccoon landed on top of him. Gamora brought Peter Quill on board the ship revealing her findings and the Guardians of the Galaxy prepared to leave. Quill refused to say they had to kill Ego and began piloting the ship to the planet's core. Gamora, Drax and Mantis were thrown from the ship when the Omnicrafts sent by Sovereign attacked and Mantis was forced to subdue Ego by putting him to sleep when he found them.

Gamora during the Battle on Ego's Planet
Gamora was visibly distressed when she thought Quill had been killed in the craft's explosion and was relieved when he, as well as Nebula and Yondu Udonta, was revealed to be alive. After Mantis was knocked unconscious and Ego began to attack, she and Nebula fell from the crumbling ledge. Gamora was saved by her sister and the two began to climb back to the top to return to the fight before being suffocated by the organic matter Ego created to subdue them.

The Guardians of the Galaxy battle Ego
When Quill took control, both sisters survived and made their way to the ship piloted by Kraglin Obfonteri on the surface. She refused to leave Quill behind but was tasered by Rocket Raccoon to stop her from being killed in the explosion of the planet. Eventually, Ego was killed when Groot and Rocket Raccoon set off a bomb in the center of the planet, and thanks to Yondu Udonta's sacrifice, Peter escaped and reunite with Gamora and the others. 

Yondu's Funeral
The Guardians of the Galaxy attend Yondu Udonta's funeral
Following the Battle on Ego's Planet, Yondu Udonta was hosted a funeral for his heroic self-sacrifice, which enabled the Guardians of the Galaxy to flee before the planet's destruction. Gamora, along with the Guardians of the Galaxy, Stakar Ogord's Team, Aleta Ravager Clan, Charlie-27 Ravager Clan, Mainframe Ravager Clan, and the Krugarr Ravager Clan all together attended Yondu Udonta's funeral, where Star-Lord expressed delight at the fact that Yondu was his true father.

Gamora reconciles with Nebula
When Nebula went to leave, she tried to persuade her to join them, saying that there were other daughters who are in danger because of Thanos and gave her sister a hug when the offer was declined, Nebula responded that she is more useful as killing Thanos to prevent other daughters from the same fate that hers. The two sisters hugged before Nebula departed. As the Ravagers arrived to pay their respects, she hinted to Peter Quill that she did perhaps reciprocate his feelings and the pair embraced.

Infinity War
Meeting Thor
Gamora responds to the distress signal
The Guardians of the Galaxy responded to the distress call sent out by the Statesman after the ship was attacked by Thanos and the Black Order. Gamora was concerned with helping people in distress, while Rocket Raccoon and Star-Lord were interested in how much they could get as a reward. Upon arrival at the origin of the distress call, they found the Statesman destroyed with dead Asgardian bodies floating in space and recovered Thor from the wreckage.

Gamora meets Thor
Gamora was taken with Thor's physique, much to the discomfort of Star-Lord who began imitating him. Thor recounted his encounter with Thanos to the Guardians, telling them that the Mad Titan was after the Infinity Stones. As Drax revealed to the Asgardian that Gamora was the adopted daughter of Thanos, Thor walked in front of her under the pretense of threatening her. Instead, he comforted her, stating that families were tough, relating to when he had to kill his sister during Ragnar√∂k; Star-Lord shared this sentiment, explaining that he had to kill Ego. 

Gamora talks about Thanos' life-long plan
As Thor attempted to steal some of their food, Star-Lord intervened and attempted to imitate his voice, which created a brief argument between the two. Fed up with their quarrel, Gamora asked about Thanos' plan, to which Thor responded that Thanos already obtained the Power Stone after effortlessly destroying the Nova Corps and decimating half of Xandar's population and the Space Stone during the Attack on the Statesman.

Gamora is told the Infinity Stones' locations
Thor assured that the Time and Mind Stones were safe on Earth, as they were being protected by the Avengers and the Masters of the Mystic Arts. He surmised that Thanos was heading to Knowhere to collect the Reality Stone, which was in the possession of the Collector, who was given the stone following the Second Dark Elf Conflict. Afterward, Star-Lord claimed that Knowhere sucked, relating to their previous encounter with the Collector in 2014 during the Quest for the Orb when they attempted to deliver the Orb to him.

Gamora thinking about the Soul Stone
Thor also mentioned that no one knew where the Soul Stone was, to which Gamora reacted uncomfortably, as she possessed knowledge on the location of the Infinity Stone. Thor, along with Rocket and Groot, decided to head to Nidavellir, the homeworld of the Dwarves, to forge a weapon to kill Thanos, while Gamora accompanied Star-Lord, Drax the Destroyer, and Mantis to Knowhere to procure the Reality Stone.

Return to Knowhere
Gamora asks Star-Lord to kill her if needed
On the way to Knowhere, Gamora took Star-Lord to one side and made him promise to kill her if Thanos captured her. Gamora told him that she knew something that Thanos could never know. Star-Lord asked her what it was, but Gamora refused to tell him, stating that he would be in danger if he knew as well. As they embraced each other and kissed, their moment was interrupted by Drax the Destroyer, who was "mastering" the art of being invisible by standing totally still. As the two rebutted his argument, Mantis appeared and greeted him much to his disappointment.

Gamora and the Guardians of the Galaxy arrive on Knowhere
Arriving at Knowhere, the Guardians of the Galaxy then headed to the Collector's Museum to find Thanos threatening the Collector and demanding to know where the Reality Stone was. As Tivan claimed that he sold it to someone else, Drax finally decided to exact his revenge on Thanos who ordered Ronan the Accuser to kill his family on Kylos. As Drax started to charge Thanos, however, Mantis put him to sleep with her empathic powers, causing him to fall on the floor. The loud commotion alerted Thanos to the Guardians' presence.

Gamora attempts to finally kill Thanos
Thanos glanced in their direction and proceeded to throw Tivan in a specimen cage, deciding to engage them personally. Sensing an opportunity, Gamora attacked Thanos, stabbing him in the neck with Godslayer and then plunging the dagger that he gave her into his chest. As Thanos seemingly died, Gamora broke down crying. Tivan then congratulated her from the cage he was trapped in. The Guardians shockingly witnessed Thanos' "demise." However, as Gamora continued to mourn, Thanos' voice rang out, telling her that he was sure she still cared about him, dropping the illusion.

Gamora discovers Thanos' deceptions
Thanos had already obtained the Reality Stone and had staged the entire event. The Reality Stone revealed the true nature of Knowhere; burning and destroyed with Thanos alive and well. Taking Gamora hostage, the Guardians attempted to save her, but Thanos used the Reality Stone to temporarily take out Drax and Mantis. Star-Lord aimed his Quad Blasters at Thanos, threatening to kill him if he did not let Gamora go.

Gamora demanding Peter Quill to kill her
Gamora reminded Star-Lord of his promise and he reluctantly pointed the weapon at her with Thanos tempting him to shoot her. His hesitation caused Thanos to mock Star-Lord, telling Gamora that she expected too much from him. After confessing their love for each other, Star-Lord finally worked up the courage and resolve to shoot Gamora, but Thanos used the Reality Stone to turn the weapon's discharge into bubbles, as well as the weapon itself. Telling Star-Lord he liked him, Thanos used the Space Stone to transport himself and Gamora away from Knowhere.

Sisters Reunited
Gamora being offered some food by Thanos
Thanos brought Gamora to his ship, where he tried to reconnect with his lost daughter but she rebuffed his offer of food, throwing the food he offered at his throne, which she bitterly said she always hated, as well as the ship and her life, but Thanos responded by saying that irregardless, he had always hoped that one day, Gamora would sit on his throne after him. As Gamora spoke of how much she hated her life with Thanos, Thanos calmly remarked that she had told him that as well for over twenty years. 

Gamora argues with Thanos about his plans
Gamora reminisced on how she was young when Thanos took her and rebuffed his belief that he saved her, saying that she was happy in Zen-Whoberi, which Thanos countered by saying on how her planet was so overpopulated that children had no homes and to survive, her people had to hound the planet for scraps and he was the one who saved her planet. Gamora bitterly said that he did it by wiping out half of the Zehobereis and Thanos simply said that it is a small price to pay for salvation.

Gamora is told she lied about the Soul Stone
As the talk became tenser, with Gamora rejecting all that Thanos believed and expressing her hatred for him and everything he taught her, Thanos told Gamora that it was because of his teachings that she became the fiercest woman in the galaxy and he trusted her to find the Soul Stone; Gamora sarcastically apologized for failing him, despite the fact that she had indeed discovered its location and burned the map to prevent him from finding it.

Gamora learns that Nebula has been captured
Thanos then revealed that he had always known that she had found the Soul Stone, calmly telling her that he was disappointed in her, not because she failed him, but because she had found the Soul Stone and lied to him about not doing so. Thanos then took Gamora to see Nebula suspended in a field with her cybernetic body parts pulled apart. As Gamora looked in horror, Thanos revealed that he had captured her after she snuck aboard the ship some time after the Battle on Ego's Planet to kill him and she had nearly succeeded, which resulted in him incarcerating her in the cell.

Gamora watches as Thanos tortures Nebula
Using the Power Stone, Thanos tortured her in front of Gamora to make her reveal the location of the Soul Stone. After swearing on her life to Thanos that she did not know its location, Thanos proved his knowledge of Gamora's lie by accessing Nebula's memory and showed her a hologram projection from her eye showing Gamora telling her sister that she had found the map to the Soul Stone and burned it to ash to prevent him from ever locating it.

Gamora seeing Nebula for the last time
After the transmission ended, Thanos lectured Gamora on how he is responsible for her being strong and generous, but noted that he never taught her how to lie, that being the reason why she had poor lying skills. Thanos then proceeded to ask Gamora once more where the Soul Stone was, causing her to contemplate in silence and anguish. After having tortured Nebula some more with the Infinity Stones, Gamora finally relented and told Thanos the Stone was on the planet Vormir.

Unwilling Sacrifice
Gamora is taken back to Vormir with Thanos
Gamora, giving in after watching Nebula being tortured, reluctantly led Thanos to a planet called Vormir. As they walked on the barren planet, Thanos reminded Gamora that the Soul Stone better be in Vormir for her sister's sake. While climbing to the top of the mountain, they were greeted by the Red Skull, who knew their identities, and he referred to Thanos as the son of A'Lars and Gamora as the daughter of Thanos.

Gamora and Thanos meet the Red Skull
Insistent upon retrieving the six Infinity Stones as soon as possible, Thanos immediately asked the Red Skull where the Soul Stone was located, to which he responded that the stone extracted a terrible price. Thanos confidently claimed to be prepared to do whatever it took to retrieve the Soul Stone. However, Red Skull warned Gamora and Thanos that everyone who tried to obtain the Soul Stone thought that it would be easy, but they were, in fact, wrong about that assertion.

Gamora and Thanos being led by Red Skull
While being led to the top of the mountain, Thanos inquired as to how the Red Skull knew so much about the nature of the Infinity Stones, to which he noted that he himself tried to possess the Space Stone during World War II, but had been cast out to Vormir after he abused the Tesseract's power, alluding to his confrontation with Captain America. As a result of his misdeeds, he had been cursed to be the guardian of the Soul Stone, guiding others who sought it.

Gamora is told that she will be the sacrifice
As they reached the cliff, Red Skull led them to the edge of the mountain, claiming that what Thanos sought laid in front of him. As Gamora looked down, she asked what he was talking about. The Red Skull claimed that Thanos needed the sacrifice of a loved one to be given the Soul Stone as it carried a special place amongst the Infinity Stones. Thanos then learned that he needed to throw that person he loved off the cliff to their death. 

Gamora is forced off the cliff by Thanos
Gamora, upon hearing this, unleashed her bitter resentment for Thanos' seeming lack of love for anyone by laughing and saying how she had dreamed that Thanos would be punished for all he had done and that the moment is finally here as the universe found Thanos unworthy because he loved no one but himself. Thanos turned around and revealed tears, which she believed was due to his failure, and continued to taunt him.

Gamora is sacrificed for the Soul Stone
However, the truth was that Thanos was crying because he would have to sacrifice Gamora as he truly loved her as his daughter. Genuinely surprised and for a brief moment, almost happy, Gamora still quickly attempted suicide to prevent Thanos from obtaining the stone, but Thanos easily turned her dagger to bubbles and tearfully apologized and, while still in tears, dragged her over to the cliff and threw her to her death. Thanos then awakened with the Soul Stone in his hand.

Legacy
Star-Lord's Rage
Thanos arrived on Titan to retrieve the Time and Mind Stones from the Black Order. Instead, he was confronted by the combined forces of Star-Lord, Nebula- who escaped from the Sanctuary II-, Drax the Destroyer, Mantis, Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Doctor Strange. During his fight with the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy, Strange restricted the gauntlet while Drax the Destroyer, Iron Man and Spider-Man restrained Thanos' arms and legs, allowing Mantis to inflict sleep upon him using her powers.

Star-Lord then mocked Thanos and demanded the location of Gamora, visibly causing him to become crestfallen. Mantis then revealed that Thanos was mourning, which led Nebula to understand in horror and sadness that he had sacrificed her for the Soul Stone. Star-Lord then angrily questioned Thanos to tell her that Nebula was lying and Thanos emotionally said he had to. In the end, Thanos overcame and defeated them, forcing Strange to hand the Time Stone to him.

Soulworld
Gamora's soul meets Thanos in the Soulworld
After Thanos snapped his fingers with the Infinity Gauntlet during the Battle of Wakanda, he was transported to the Soulworld inside the Soul Stone. There, Gamora's soul met Thanos in her child form and calmly asked if he had done it and the resigned Thanos told her he had achieved his goal. Gamora asked what it had cost and Thanos sadly smiled and said it cost him everything, referring to how she was the only thing he loved. 

Apparently accepting defeat, Gamora sadly smiled before Thanos returned to reality as the Snap started, causing half of the life in the universe to fade away into nothingness. However, three weeks after the ending of the Infinity War and before his death at the blade of Thor's Stormbreaker, Thanos used the Infinity Stones to destroy themselves, obliterating the Soulworld within the Soul Stone, but what happened to Gamora's soul is unknown.

Traveling to 2023
Learning about the Future
Gamora chastises Nebula
In an alternate 2014, Nebula was massacring Korbinites as Thanos waged another cleansing for half of a population. She was bested by a stray grenade and rescued from an enemy soldier by 2014 Gamora, who extended a helping hand, only to be smacked away. Perturbed by being helped after having claimed that she was fine without Gamora's aid, Nebula demanded an explanation for her arrival, only for her to relay that Thanos has found the Power Stone on Morag.

Gamora witnesses Nebula's drive glitching
As Gamora and Nebula reunited with Thanos on a Q-Ship before he informed him that he was preparing to send them to the Dark Aster under the orders of Ronan the Accuser, Nebula's synaptic drive started to glitch and showed a hologram of War Machine and another individual in 2014 on Morag as the latter suggested that they take cover as Thanos and Ronan the Accuser were searching for the Power Stone in 2014 during the Quest for the Orb.

Gamora being ordered to escort Nebula
Gamora then interrogates Nebula as to who that was in the hologram, to which she claimed not to know. Curious, Thanos orders Nebula to be examined by Ebony Maw on the Sanctuary II to figure out the cause of her discrepancy. As she is examined by the member of the Black Order, Maw realizes through examining the file that another consciousness is sharing Nebula's network, claiming there to be two Nebula's in 2014, with one time traveling from 2023.

Gamora watches Nebula being analyzed
Having instructed Ronan and Korath to delay the Quest for the Orb, Thanos ultimately discovered from one of Nebula's files that he created the Snap in the original timeline, which the Avengers- whom Gamora recognized as Terrans- are trying to undo with the Time Heist. In addition, Thanos also watches an archived memory of him being killed by Thor after which he revealed that he destroyed the Infinity Stones. A merciful Thanos gave Nebula the chance to prove her loyalty to him when Maw had attempted to execute her, believing that she betrayed his cause.

Switching Sides
Gamora is brought to 2023
Having examined her memories, Thanos instructs Ebony Maw to travel to Morag so he could abduct the future Nebula. Once the future version of Nebula was captured by Thanos' forces, 2014 Nebula began to brutally torture her future self, claiming that she disgusted her. 2023 Nebula, knowing Gamora's hatred for her father, attempted to turn Gamora against Thanos early by telling her that Thanos found the Soul Stone in the original timeline, cryptically alluding to the fact that Thanos killed her original self to obtain the Soul Stone.

Gamora asks Nebula about their future
However, 2023 Nebula was silenced by her past self who removed her superficial armor plate to resemble her future self as 2014 Nebula was planning to bring the Sanctuary II to 2023 to destroy the entire universe with the Infinity Stones. After the 2014 Nebula recovered the Nano Gauntlet as Thanos and his army time-traveled to the present, Gamora, considering Nebula's cryptic message on how Thanos obtained the Soul Stone, visited an incarcerated Nebula to ask her about their relationship in the future.

Gamora decides to free Nebula
Nebula opens up to her, admitting to the fact that she tried to kill her on dozens of occasions such as during the Skirmish on Knowhere, the Battle of Xandar, and the Attack on Gamora in the original timelines. As Gamora looks away, Nebula reveals that the two ultimately became close sisters in the end. Upon hearing this, Gamora freed Nebula, telling her that they could still stop Thanos from destroying the entire universe.

Battle of Earth
Gamora defects and stops 2014 Nebula
2023 Nebula and Gamora left the Sanctuary II and came to rescue Hawkeye, who was nearly killed by 2014 Nebula, who already retrieved the Nano-Gauntlet. Gamora tried to convince 2014 Nebula to change sides, claiming that she could change and be a better person. The younger Nebula refused, citing that Thanos wouldn't allow her to change, and attempted to shoot Gamora. However, 2014 Nebula was instead shot dead by her older self.

Gamora encounters a confused Star-Lord
During the Battle of Earth, Gamora saved the life of Star-Lord, who was being overpowered by a pair of Sakaarans. Quill, surprised and shocked, mistakes her for the Gamora he knew, believing her to have been alive. As he prepared to caress her face, she kicks him in the balls twice while warning him not to touch her as she had not encountered him before. Having learned of their relationship, Gamora was left incredulous that she chose Quill in the original timeline, leading Nebula to comment that it was a choice between Quill and Groot.

Gamora assists Captain Marvel in battle
Later in the battle, when Captain Marvel had arrived to participate in the battle, having been summoned by the Avengers, and was tasked with returning the stones to Luis' van, Gamora, along with a group of other heroines, assisted her in fighting past Thanos' army. As they cleared a path for Captain Marvel, Gamora slashed a Chitauri Gorilla along the way. However, Thanos managed to destroy the van with his Double-Edged Sword.

Gamora leaving after the battle is won
Ultimately, the battle came to an end when Iron Man snapped his fingers to decimate all of the past Thanos' forces from existence, including Thanos himself, though at the cost of his own life. Gamora observed her fellow allies take a knee to honor Stark's death. Electing not to follow their action, Gamora glanced at Stark's body before walking away from the battlefield.

Personality
Gamora, throughout most of her life, has been molded into a living weapon, and the only family that she knew and raised her are the people she considered enemies. Because of her assassin background, Gamora can be stoic, distant, and merciless to her foes or targets. Her reputation as the most deadly woman in the galaxy precedes her, as Rocket Raccoon states "anyone who is anyone knows who [Gamora] is". Whilst she was an equal level of criminal to the rest of her teammates when they first met, Gamora valued honor greatly and held Star-Lord with disdain for being a dishonorable thief alone. However, she was willing to work with the Guardians of the Galaxy to escape the Kyln and sell the Orb though she was monumentally irritated by them, Drax in particular.

During combat, she can be aggressive and ruthless due to her tendency for war cries and her willingness to kill without restraint. However, she will often use strategy to avoid murder when possible such as flirting with Quill so to steal the Orb from him without fatal means, only resorting to killing when it became clear that Quill wasn't going to surrender without a fight or the fact that he might sell it to someone dangerous like the Broker or Ronan if he managed to escape. Within the Kyln, Gamora was almost killed by Drax and Moloka Dar, but she only restrained them instead of killing them and non-lethally incapacitates the guards when they were trying to escape. When arguing with Nebula regarding who was the better assassin, Gamora told her that the difference between them was that she took too long murdering her victims, showing that she lacks the sadistic desire for a painful death Nebula had.

Her brutal training by Thanos could have turned her into someone like her sister, Nebula but by comparison, Gamora is extremely caring. When she discovered the Orb's destructive power, she didn't hesitate to surrender it to the Nova Corps despite the threat of arrest and angrily chastising Quill for attempting to sell it. Despite her hatred for everyone connected towards Thanos as well as her rivalry towards her sister and her attempts to kill her earlier, Gamora consoles her and genuinely cares for her. Throughout all their altercations, Gamora would always try to reason with Nebula and held back so as not to kill her. However, during childhood, she was too self-focused on her own survival that she didn't seem to care about what happened to Nebula when Thanos would torture her for losing against Gamora in combat, something which Gamora didn't even realize until adulthood and shows remorse for this, but defends this by saying that she was a child like Nebula and scared for her own life. Her love for Nebula was shown when she quickly gave in and told Thanos the Soul Stone is on Vormir when she saw Nebula tortured.

Gamora possesses a mixture of love and hatred for Thanos for ruining her childhood and massacring half of her people but for also loving her as a daughter and training her to become a warrior. For years, Gamora was loyal to Thanos but she never completely committed to his cause, which caused her to burn the map to the Soul Stone upon finding it even before she fully defected from him when she met her fellow Guardians. She even went as far as to lie that Thanos killed her parents in front of her while it was not the case and Thanos actually gently kept her from seeing the massacre of her people. When they reunited, despite Thanos' kind attempts to reconcile with her, Gamora bitterly rejected everything and did not hesitate to express her profound hatred for him. However, despite all of this, Gamora does still love Thanos as a father to some degree but could not bring herself to admit it and created the lie to justify her hatred for Thanos, as she still cried when she seemingly killed him and Thanos himself said that he knew she still cared for him deep down. While she was quick to attempt suicide to prevent Thanos from obtaining the Soul Stone, Gamora was genuinely shocked and seemed almost happy after learning that Thanos genuinely loved her as his daughter and the fact she had to die for him to complete his mission deeply shocked and devastated him for a brief moment before she tried to kill herself. Thanos also said that she once had the same will as he has as she fought alongside him, implying that she at first did have some dedication to Thanos' cause until she saw him for what he was and turned against him. It could also be possible that she initially believed in his goal to balance the universe by killing half its population to be the right thing until she began to disagree with it.

Unlike the other Guardians, Gamora lacks the comical quirks and deep-seated personality issues giving her a more serious and deadly personality. However, like Drax, Gamora is ignorant of Quill's Earth lingo and pop references. She also doesn't understand figures of speech because she believed that "having a stick up your butt" which was another way of saying one was uptight was literal and considered it cruel. During a few months with the Guardians, Gamora's hardened personality has begun to vanish. She took the time during a fight with the Abilisk to wave at Groot, becoming an almost mother-figure to him and dancing with Quill on Ego's planet despite previously claiming not to dance. Gamora later consoled him about Yondu Udonta's death and hinted at having romantic feelings for him. However, she still has an aggressive edge, threatening to break the jaw of Mantis if she touched her (presumably because she didn't want Drax or anyone to know about her attraction to Quill). She eventually confessed that she loved him more than anything when she asked him to kill her after Thanos had grabbed her.

Gamora's selflessness was shown by the fact that she was willing to let Star-Lord kill her to prevent Thanos from learning the location of the Soul Stone and later quickly and desperately attempted suicide to prevent Thanos from acquiring the Stone.

After being sacrificed by Thanos, Gamora's soul trapped in the Soulworld showed a more defeated side, seemingly being the only hero who humbly accepted Thanos' victory, as when Thanos came to her, she bore no ill will towards him and calmly asked if he did it. She even showed a softer side when he solemnly replied that achieving his goal needed him to sacrifice her, sadly smiling as if to comfort Thanos.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Zehoberei Physiology/Bionic Enhancements: As a Zehoberei, Gamora naturally possesses physical capabilities beyond any human being, which were further augmented by Thanos' use of bionic and cybernetic enhancements to improve her skills as an assassin.

Gamora carrying the massive M-Ship cannon
Superhuman Strength: Due to her Zehoberei heritage and bionic enhancements, Gamora is stronger than humans and many other species, allowing her to overpower a majority of her opponents in combat. She possesses a cybernetic skeleton and has demonstrated her strength by being able to effortlessly lift Mantis by her neck with one hand and pin her to a wall, break Groot's vine binding with nothing but her strength, as well as holding up the discarded cannon of a crashed M-Ship piloted by Nebula, which was far larger than her, before using it to fire on the ship. During the battle on Xandar, Gamora was able to kick Nebula with enough force to launch her sister out of the Dark Aster. While the Milano was crash landing, Gamora was able to hold the fixture tied to Drax the Destroyer for a while without getting pulled out of the cabin. An alternate version of Gamora from 2014 was able to throw a Korbinite soldier much larger than herself back a considerable distance while decimating Korbin. However, Gamora was powerless against Thanos, as he effortlessly restrained her and threw her off of a cliff on Vormir with a single hand even with Gamora struggling to free herself with both hands.
Superhuman Durability: Gamora's bionic upgrades and the advanced physiology of her species allow her to be more resistant to physical harm. Gamora was able to survive, or at least briefly endure, various afflictions that would prove fatal to a normal human being, such as severe electrocution, deep-space exposure, or blunt force trauma. However, she did not survive being thrown off a large cliff on Vormir by Thanos, with Gamora losing a lot of blood upon impact with the ground.
Superhuman Speed: Due to cybernetic implants within her body, Gamora's speed was augmented to allow her to move faster than a normal Zehoberian.
Superhuman Agility: As a bionically-enhanced Zehoberei, Gamora possesses a high level of agility that gives her an advantage over her opponents, such as when she was able to leap at a tremendous height and distance while helping the other Guardians escape from the Kyln. Gamora wears specially designed shoes with springy heels which allow her to jump higher than she normally could, and when combined with her agility, allowed her to leap a great height when attempting to slaughter the Abilisk.
Superhuman Stamina: Gamora's two livers allow her to metabolize and filter toxins faster than any human and her respiratory implants allow her to intake oxygen at greater efficiency than any human.
Superhuman Reflexes: Gamora's natural reflexes have been augmented by the use of nanomachines throughout her bloodstream, increasing her reaction time in combat situations.
Enhanced Vision: Gamora's ocular implants allow her to see farther than what her species is capable of. This allowed her to easily notice Nebula flying in onto Ego's planet from afar.
Regenerative Healing Factor: Bio-augmentations such as nanomachines within her bloodstream have granted Gamora the power to regenerate quickly from most injuries or infections, allowing her to easily get back into fighting shape after being exposed to deep-space without any protection.
Abilities
Gamora fighting against Star-Lord
Master Martial Artist: Trained extensively by Thanos and having years of fighting experience when carrying out Thanos' missions, Gamora is highly proficient in both armed and hand-to-hand combat. Gamora's skills were so advanced that even Thanos himself held her at such high regard that he openly considered her the finest of his children and the fiercest woman in the Galaxy, with her being known to having constantly beat Nebula, a very proficient fighter in her own right, in their spars. Hence, she quickly gained and maintained the upper hand over Star-Lord, easily broke out from Groot and Rocket's attempts to restrain her, and while holding back, as she was only attempting to reason with Nebula rather than kill her, easily held her own against and eventually defeated Nebula even after Nebula disarmed her, an expert combatant in her own right, in their spars, only losing in their latest altercation due to being weakened and still holding her own before being pinned down.
Sword Mastery: Gamora is shown to be highly skilled in using her sword, with it being her primary method of combat, as she was able to easily amputate and overpower Groot, battle against Nebula wielding her batons during the Battle of Xandar, disarming her of one of her weapons, and cut down the Abilisk. While on a mission in Conjunction's Casino, Gamora used dual blades to swiftly cut several enemies who attempted to attack her.
Expert Marksman: Although Gamora was known to prefer using melee combat, especially swords, much more often, her training under Thanos nevertheless allowed her to acquire a level of proficiency in using firearms. She displayed this skill when she effectively wielded a rifle while battling the Abilisk, and later turned a ship's turret into a hand-held weapon and accurately shot and swiftly destroyed the M-Ship Nebula attacked her on. She is also an excellent knife-thrower, able to throw a knife with such accuracy from a great distance that she was able to avoid amputating Quill's arm while still forcing him to drop the Orb.
Master Assassin: Gamora is an exceptional assassin, being so great that she was known for never having failed her missions while under Thanos' tutelage and even earning such fearful reputation that she was considered the "deadliest woman in the galaxy" due to her work as an assassin. Nebula, herself an extensively trained assassin who was skilled enough to have come close to assassinating Thanos, stated that Gamora is the better assassin.
Expert Pilot: Gamora is a capable pilot, as shown when in an attempt to escape from Nebula and a group of Sakaarans on Knowhere, Gamora was able to single-handedly command and fly a mining pod with relative ease. She managed to avoid being decisively shot down until she was eventually forced to escape to space, which shut down her pod and allowed Nebula to shoot her down.
Equipment
Weapons
Gamora deploys Godslayer
Godslayer: Gamora's weapon of choice, a retractable sword that she used to amputate Groot's limbs when he attempted to restrain her, and in her duel against Nebula. The original Godslayer was broken in two when she attempted to kill an illusion of Thanos before she stabbed him with a part of the sword. A past version of Godslayer is still in use by a version of Gamora from 2014.
Gamora's Switchblade: Thanos gave her a switchblade during their first encounter on Zen-Whoberi. Gamora later used it in her attempted assassination of Thanos on Knowhere.
Power Stone: During their final battle with Ronan the Accuser, Gamora and the other Guardians of the Galaxy used the Power Stone in tandem to direct the Stone's energy at Ronan, destroying his body and killing him.
Plasma Rifle: During an encounter with the Abilisk, Gamora used a plasma rifle to fight off an attempt to kill it, only to have it run out of ammo.
Other Equipment
Cybernetic Skeleton: While in the service of Thanos, Gamora had cybernetic appendages installed in her providing enhanced strength and durability.
Ocular and Respiratory Implants: Gamora had implants installed in her visual system and respiratory system, providing enhanced stamina and vision.
Aero-Rigs: Another invention of Rocket, a jet-pack device that allowed Gamora to fly smoothly through the air while fighting the Abilisk.

Prisons
Kyln: After having been arrested on Xandar, Gamora was transported to the Kyln along with Star-Lord, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot as a punishment for their crimes. Nevertheless, the four vigilantes as well as Drax the Destroyer formed an unlikely alliance and managed to escape from the Kyln.

Trivia
In the comics, Gamora possesses different physical characteristics such as green hair and yellow patch-like tattoos over her eyes, and she was eventually entrusted to protect the Time Gem.
Of all his adopted children, Thanos genuinely loved Gamora, to the extent that not only did he hope that she would inherit his throne one day, but he also genuinely mourned her death after he was forced to sacrifice her to the Soul Stone on Vormir.
Behind the Scenes
Zoe Saldana described Gamora as "...a warrior, she‚Äôs an assassin and she‚Äôs very lethal but what saves her is the same thing that can doom her. She has a sense of righteousness. She‚Äôs a very righteous individual."
Before Zoe Saldana was cast as Gamora, Olivia Wilde and Amanda Seyfried turned down the role of Gamora, while Rosario Dawson, Gina Carano, Rachel Nichols, Kristanna Loken, Moon Bloodgood and Adrianne Palicki auditioned before the role.
Ameenah Kaplan was a reader for the role of Gamora in Avengers: Endgame.
Chlo√© Bruce, Lee-Anne Telford, Bethany Levy and Ana Shepherd were stunt doubles for Zoe Saldana in the role of Gamora.
Abidemi Sobande, Eli Logue, Anna Elizabeth and LaNease Adams were stand-ins for Zoe Saldana in the role of Gamora.
