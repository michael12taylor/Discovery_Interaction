Trivia
In the comics, Hawkeye is the ex-husband of Bobbi Morse and married a woman named Laura in the Ultimate comics. Between the end of Civil War, Barton took the identity of Ronin, while letting Kate Bishop keep the Hawkeye alias in his honor.
In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Endgame and Black Widow, Natasha Romanoff wore a necklace with an arrow pendant as a symbol of her friendship with Barton.
In Captain America: Civil War, the scene where Barton fires a trick arrow with Ant-Man on the arrowhead is based on the cover of Avengers Vol 1 #223.
Barton is a fan of Pat Benatar's Hit Me with Your Best Shot.
In Captain America: Civil War, when Barton quips,"I knew I should have stretched" when fighting Vision, that is a reference to a running joke called the 'Renner Stretch' that started when Jeremy Renner would stretch whenever he got nervous.
Behind the Scenes
Hawkeye is the only Avenger from the first film that did not appear in a Phase Two movie prior to Avengers: Age of Ultron, or Avengers: Infinity War; however, he was mentioned in the latter.
Jeremy Renner is left-handed, but since the character is ambidextrous he is shown shooting from his right hand in Thor and his left hand in The Avengers. However, he usually uses his left hand to pull back on the arrow.
Hawkeye was originally going to appear in Captain America: The Winter Soldier before his appearance was scrapped by directors Joe and Anthony Russo.
Jeremy Renner was uncredited for his appearance in Thor and for his voice acting in Black Widow.
Jensen Ackles was approached for the role of Hawkeye in The Avengers, but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts with Supernatural.
Alex Chansky, Adam Brashaw, Kyle Mclean, Mark R. Miscione and Richard Burden were stunt doubles for Jeremy Renner in the role of Hawkeye.
Aaron Worthington was a stand-in and a double for Jeremy Renner in the role of Hawkeye.
Hawkeye is the only Avenger from the first film that has not received his own solo movie. The movie was planned but never reached development.
However, he received a TV series, being the only Avenger from the first film to get one.
However, he received a TV series, being the only Avenger from the first film to get one.
Joss Whedon had a detailed backstory for Hawkeye written up for The Avengers, but was unable to even reference any of it, due to time constraints. During the early planning stages, Barton was envisioned to be depicted as a circus performer, trained by criminals, who manipulate him into fighting the team, essentially a modernized version of his 616 comic book counterpart.
Hawkeye was previously planned to debut in Iron Man 2.
In the original script for Captain America: Civil War, Hawkeye was going to appear much earlier in the story, assisting the transport of Bucky Barnes to Berlin. In this sequence, he had dialogue with Barnes about being brainwashed, telling Barnes the story of when he was brainwashed by Loki in The Avengers.
