During the Battle of Wakanda, Falcon shot down numerous Outriders from mid-air. Steve Rogers admitted that if he had known the Attack on the HYDRA Research Base would become a firefight, he would have requested his services. Wilson has also shown himself apt with being able to throw Steve’s shield with great accuracy.
Expert Acrobat: Wilson is a highly trained acrobat capable of withstanding constant equilibrium shifting during flight.

Equipment
Weapons
Falcon shooting his dual pistols at Thanos
Falcon's Twin Guns: Falcon carries two of these machine pistols in the holsters of his EXO-7 Suit. The mechanical aids in Falcon's forearms provide speedy upholstering and assembly of the machine pistols. He used them against Quinjets and crew members during an assault on the Project Insight Helicarriers. He also resorted to using them to defend the New Avengers Facility from Ant-Man when he infiltrated the compound, attempting to shoot at him believing the intruder was hostile. In their mission to stop Brock Rumlow in Lagos, Wilson used his guns to confront Rumlow's mercenaries inside the IFID Headquarters. While on the run, he used them to threaten Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive by holding them at gunpoint and later fired them as a last resort at Thanos. He stopped using the twin guns following the Blip.
Dual Barrel Wrist-mounted Machine Gun: The left gauntlet of Falcon's redesigned uniform utilizes a wrist-mounted dual emission machine gun controlled via clenching a fist. Falcon utilized this firearm against Ant-Man.
Wrist-mounted Miniature Rocket Launcher: Falcon utilized a wrist-mounted miniature rocket launcher on his right bracer against Spider-Man during the Clash of the Avengers.
Wilson practices with throwing the shield
Captain America's Shield: After Steve Rogers returned to the past to live his life with Peggy Carter, he met with Wilson to give him his iconic shield. Although he initially felt unworthy of the shield and declined the mantle of Captain America, he changed his mind after he was forced to reclaim the shield from the unhinged John Walker. The vibranium composition allows the shield to absorb and reflect kinetic energy from impacts, therefore, making it nigh-indestructible. Nearly every kind of human weaponry cannot even dent it, as bullets normally bounce off it. The shield's shape makes it a superb throwing weapon as it can cut through the air with minimal wind resistance. It is also able to bounce off solid objects, such as walls and floors, when struck on its edge and can be ricocheted off of multiple surfaces, and makes a formidable and devastating hand-held weapon.
M4A1 Carbine: An assault rifle that Wilson obtained from one of the HYDRA mercenaries accompanying the Winter Soldier. Wilson used it to cover for Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff after being ambushed by the mercenaries in Washington, D.C.. He briefly held another M4A1 in Madripoor, commandeered from a security guard, but he discarded it before he could use it.
Knife: Falcon utilized a knife to cut off the strap of a HYDRA operative's M4A1 Carbine during the fight against the HYDRA mercenaries.
Other Equipment
EXO-7 Falcon: A jetpack with wings that enables the user to fly. The wings can also be used as defensive and offensive weapons, as they are highly flexible and bulletproof. Due to the wings length, they can be used as mid-ranged weapons, mostly for stabbing. It also stores miniature guided missiles that seek out targets predetermined by Redwing.
Combat Goggles: Falcon has a pair of protective goggles that not only protect his eyes during high speed flight, but also possess telescopic and microscopic vision, allowing him to see and track even a shrunken Ant-Man.
Falcon sending out Redwing onto a mission
Redwing: A drone mounted on the EXO-7 Falcon's back that assists Falcon during missions to survey an area for enemies, which allowed Falcon to confirm Crossbones' location before his attack. During combat missions Redwing is fitted with twin guns that extend from both wings for offense, as well as a projectile grappling handcuff line on its underside, which Falcon used against Spider-Man to throw him out of a window.
Captain America Uniform: To be added
Vehicles
Paul & Darlene: During his youth in Louisiana, Wilson and his sister spent much of their time onboard their family's boat, supporting their Wilson Family Seafood business, with Wilson being incredibly passionate about the boat and it's personal history to him. Once Wilson returned home, he was informed by his sister that she would be forced to sell the boat, due to not being able to afford to keep it running, only for Wilson to insist that she allow him to try and raise the funds to keep the boat.
Quinjet: During their time on the run from the law, Wilson would pilot Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff onboard their stolen Quinjet. Upon rescuing Wanda Maximoff and Vision from the clutches of the Black Order, Wilson flew them back to the New Avengers Facility to make their plan. Agreeing that they would seek help from Wakanda, Wilson flew the Quinjet there, fearing that he would crash into the mountains, only for him to discover that this was Wakanda's disguise to protect them from discovery.
Jeep: Following their failed clash with the Flag Smashers, Wilson and Bucky Barnes were offered a lift to the airport in a jeep by John Walker and Lemar Hoskins. Although they eventually had agreed to the lift, albeit reluctantly, Wilson and Barnes eventually stormed out of the jeep and continued walking when Walker and Hoskins had offended them.
Helmut Zemo's Private Jet: After getting broken out of prison by Bucky Barnes, an old foe, Helmut Zemo, agreed to help Wilson and Barnes take down the Flag Smashers. They took Zemo's Private Jet to Madripoor and Latvia to look for leads.
Facilities
Wilson Family Residence: To be added
Sam Wilson's Apartment: While in the USAF, Wilson lived in an apartment in Washington, D.C.. During his time here, Wilson agreed to protect Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff, once they came to him after being targeted for assassination. Wilson gave Rogers and Romanoff shelter in his apartment, where they discussed their plan to go after Jasper Sitwell, with Wilson agreeing to assist them in the mission. He later left this residence in 2015, when he joined the Avengers and moved into the New Avengers Facility. In 2023, after returning from the Blip, he returned to live in the apartment, and made the decision to give up Captain America's shield.
S.H.I.E.L.D. Dam Facility: Having escaped being captured by HYDRA, Wilson was taken along with Rogers and Romanoff by Maria Hill to meet with Nick Fury at the underground facility when he was in hiding from HYDRA. From here, Wilson discussed the plan to prevent HYDRA from enacting Project Insight. Having come up with a plan, Wilson spoke to Rogers on the top of the base about the likelihood that he would be able to save Bucky Barnes from HYDRA's brainwashing
Triskelion: In order to stop Project Insight from being launched Wilson accompanied Rogers and Hill into the building, where they swiftly took over the control room and alerted the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents of HYDRA's infiltration. Once Wilson's EXO-7 Falcon had been damaged during a brief clash with Winter Soldier, Wilson returned into the Triskelion and fought against Brock Rumlow, before narrowly escaping it after it was destroyed as a Helicarrier crashed into the side of the building.
Avengers Tower: Wilson was invited to attend a party at Avengers Tower, which Tony Stark was hosting to celebrate the defeat of Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, and the recovery of the Scepter. During the party, Wilson would play a game of pool with Rogers, before they discussed the search for Barnes, and the likelihood of Wilson ever joining the Avengers.
New Avengers Facility: Once Wilson became a member of the Avengers, he was given his own room in the facility. During this time, Falcon attempted to defend the facility when Ant-Man had attempted to gain access, only for Wilson to embarrassingly lose his fight against Ant-Man. However, a few months later, he and Rogers were forced to leave the facility in the wake of the Sokovia Accords and went on the run for two years. In 2018, Wilson returned to the facility briefly, having regrouped with Wanda Maximoff and James Rhodes, as he and his allies discussed a plan to deal with the impending threat of Thanos and the Black Order. When he returned to life in the Blip, Wilson saw that the facility had been destroyed and witnessed the recovery crew of the facility.
Joint Counter Terrorist Centre Building: To be added

Raft: Wilson was imprisoned on the Raft along with Clint Barton, Scott Lang, and Wanda Maximoff on the orders of Thaddeus Ross due to violating the Sokovia Accords after getting caught at Leipzig-Halle Airport. However, Steve Rogers broke into the Raft and freed them.

Trivia
In the comics, Sam Wilson is the uncle of Jim Wilson and a Harlem native who moved to California and became a drug dealer, though this fact was revealed to be a collection of false memories planted by the Red Skull. After he suffered a plane crash, he was genetically altered with the ability to speak telepathically with birds. Wilson would also eventually take over the mantle of Captain America.
Falcon's first suit in Captain America: The Winter Soldier is more similar to the suit of his Ultimate comics variant than that of his Mainstream Universe version. His second suit was given some red and white coloring as a nod to the costume from the mainstream universe. Falcon's history in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is inspired from and similar to that of his Ultimate counterpart too. Falcon's suit in The Falcon and The Winter Soldier holds the closest resemblance yet to his mainstream comic book counterpart.
Behind the Scenes
Anthony Mackie was extremely disappointed to discover that the suit he would be wearing in Captain America: The Winter Soldier would not resemble the red spandex suit from the mainstream comics.
Aaron Toney was a stunt double for Anthony Mackie in the role of Falcon.
Delpaneaux Wills, Qualen Bradley, Simon Adegbenro and Jordane Christie were stand-ins for Anthony Mackie in the role of Falcon.
Falcon was briefly considered to appear in Spider-Man: Far From Home as the new Captain America to aid Spider-Man on his adventure, but as the movie's arc centers on a new generation of heroes, it was decided to drop Falcon's appearance for "Nick Fury" to not have any of the Avengers available sans Spider-Man.
