<html><p>May asked Johnson to help her prepare for the battle she had seen. With the help of Fitz, Simmons and Lincoln Campbell, they began training May undergo her mission as fast as possible in order to change the vision's outcome. Johnson made sure the room was laid out as accurately as possible to the vision she had had the agents acted as the guards who needed to be taken out. Eventually May managed to beat the time limit. They eventually found the building where Hinton was held. Coulson gave May his last orders when suddenly the alarms in the base went off, telling them that there was an intruder. Garner was brought into the base and explained that Lash was taking over and he wanted to say goodbye to May.

Losing Andrew Garner
May talks with Andrew Garner
Phil Coulson said that May could not go to the mission since Andrew Garner was going for good. May refused by saying he was a murderer. Coulson said that if she did not go to him, she would regret this for her all life. Daisy Johnson said she would go instead of May. Garner was hooked onto an I.V. which May explained was filled with a potential cure that Jemma Simmons had been working on through Carl Creel's DNA, although it was likely that it would not work.

Garner explained that he felt that Lash was fighting for a cause that they may not yet understand. May asked Garner if he would change anything in regards to having met her, as she felt that everything bad that had happened was down to them meeting, but Garner assured her that he would not change a thing still viewed his time with May as the centre of the best moments of his life. May told Garner about a mission that Johnson was preparing for when Garner felt himself changing once again.

May sees Andrew Garner's final moments
Knowing that these were his final moments in human form, Garner rushed into the Containment Module to ensure that May was safe as he felt himself being transformed into the monster inside him. As she watched from the other side of the Module, May pressed her hand against the glass and Garner did the same, sharing one final moment of intimacy together. Garner slowly fell to the ground as his body and May saw in Lash form and she took a step back, knowing the man she loved had gone forever.

Hive's Return
Duel against Giyera
May during Phil Coulson's briefing
May entered Phil Coulson while he was staring at a screenshot of Hive inside Grant Ward. She asked him what they were looking at, and Coulson responded that the lab was working for an answer. He gave his condolences on Andrew Garner, but May said she did not want to talk about it. She then remained him he did not have a lot of kills like in Ward's case, especially those he enjoyed. May however found a bright side which was she could also kill Ward. The team then had a meeting in Coulson's office. They discussed how the being they had encountered was not Ward, and set up a plan to defeat their enemy.

They used Zephyr One to go to GT Agrochemical facility where HYDRA had raided the facility. On their way, they saw through the cameras of the facility, that Giyera was peasant in there. May asked Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons about a room in the facility where she could defeat Giyera. After they landed, May, Coulson and Alphonso Mackenzie entered the facility and May told them that HYDRA had taken equipment and files and the rest had been destroyed. May then prepared for Giyera inside the empty room. After Coulson led him into it, May closed the door mocking him for being now unable to use his powers to gain the advantage.

May fights Giyera
May then proceeded to attack Giyera, with the pair of highly skilled warriors engaging in a fierce fight to the death. The pair proved to be equally matched with both managing to gain hits on each other. Eventually Giyera was able to grab May by the throat and pin her against the wall, telling her that although he preferred not to get his hands dirty he was happy to if it meant killing her. May however told him not to bother and kicked him in the crotch before knocking him to the ground, and before he was able to get back up May slammed his head on the floor and knocked him unconscious.

Battle on Zephyr One
Giyera was put inside the Containment Module inside Zephyr One. As Mackenzie was questioning him, May told him they were close to Gideon Malick's base. Later, The alarm of the plane was set as Giyera escaped the Module. Giyera came to the the control room and managed to control the plane, with May ready to fight him again. Giyera used his power to take control on the plane, causing May flip through a glass. After the plane was in Malick's base, May checked on Simmons, but she did not respond. May then crawled to the communication system and called Daisy Johnson. She explained the situation but was knocked out by Giyera.

The plane was brought to Malick's base. Due to May's injury, she had to be carried to a safe room in Zephyr One where the team could be protected. Jemma Simmons checked on her and said that May was bleeding really bad. However, the Secret Warriors came to rescue them and saved the team. Johnson asked who could fly the plane, so May, although her injuries, managed to fly Zephyr One back to the Playground.

Monitoring the Inhumans
Back to the Playground, May was treated by Lincoln Campbell, although she refused pain medications as she used to faint when using it. When Daisy Johnson came to her, May complimented her leadership with the Secret Warriors. Johnson asked if it would be easier, but May said it would only become harder. Johnson then told her she felt Phil Coulson had made her lie to her team about the base's lockdown but May said that Coulson was doing it for a good reason.

May later got out of her bed and asked Alphonso Mackenzie what was going on, stating that the Inhumans were wondering about it. Mackenzie told her about Coulson's suspicion that Hive may had brainwashed one of the Secret Warriors. Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons confirmed that the Inhuman Lucio had been infected in the brain by Hive. May and Mackenzie told Coulson about it. May suggested to isolate the Inhumans and warned Coulson that Johnson knew he had lied to her. Suddenly the power in the base was turned off. May and other agents surrounded the Inhumans. As they argued with Coulson, he ordered May to use her I.C.E.R. on Elena Rodriguez, but she took her gun.

When the Inhumans locked themselves inside a room, May suggested to Coulson to use sleeping gas against them, but Coulson ordered her to check their lockers. Campbell was suspected to be under Hive's control and the Inhumans were all isolated. May was with Coulson when the base started shaking, revealing that Johnson had actually been swayed by Hive.

Looking for Daisy Johnson
After Daisy Johnson escaped from the Playground, May joined Phil Coulson's briefing aboard the Zephyr One. Although the Playground's doors were damaged, May managed to fly the place out of it. Once in the air, Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons told the team that they could enlist Holden Radcliffe's assistance to help them find a cure to Hive's sway, and May gave Simmons a gun to defend herself, telling her to use it if she felt it right. Later, Coulson told May that he intended to look for Alisha Whitley before Hive could get to her. As Lincoln Campbell had to join, Coulson trusted May with a detonator for a bomb vest that May would have to use if Campbell was infected by Hive.

May had an angry conversation with Coulson about whether they should be ready to sacrifice Johnson or Campbell to arrest Hive. After that, the interview with Whitley went wrong as she was already under Hive's influence. May joined the fight and fought her clones, but was knocked out before being saved by Coulson. Coulson later apologized to May for being abrupt with her. When they heard about a minor earthquake caused by Johnson in South Dakota, where JT James was living, May flied the Zephyr One to the location. On site, May and Coulson discovered that something had been dug up and that the area had been set to explode, though Coulson managed to save May and himself with his new Energy Shield.

Back to the Playground, May joined Coulson in his office and attended the last offensive on HYDRA.

Kree Interference
May sharing a drink with Hellfire
When Lincoln Campbell confronted May because they did not let him helping with the search of Daisy Johnson, May abruptly rebuffed him. When they finally located Johnson in Union City, Wyoming, May was sent there with Alphonso Mackenzie and some other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents with the objective of killing Hive. On site, May recognized Hellfire and infiltrated the city by posing as a HYDRA operative and took advantage of Hellfire hitting on her to get some intel about Hive's plans and location before knocking him down.

It soon turned out that Hive was luring the Kree Reapers into Union City, making the place highly dangerous for the S.H.I.E.L.D. team. May joined the rest of the team and watched the Kree slaughtering the Inhumans. When they felt a quake, May could not keep Mackenzie from trying to save Johnson. May followed a Kree Reaper who went to fight Hive. When the Kree was killed, Phil Coulson ordered May and her team to shoot Hive, but the ancient Inhuman survived the assault. May fled, only to see Mackenzie being attacked by Johnson. They rescued him and flied back to the Playground, their operation having failed.

Desperate Measures
May paying a final visit to her former husband
Coulson ordered May to use any means necessary to stop Hive. May visited Lincoln Campbell while he was still locked in a Containment Module and told him to be patient as General Glenn Talbot was present at the Playground. She then ordered Jemma Simmons to help S.H.I.E.L.D. understand Hive's psychology as she had spent time with both Grant Ward and Will Daniels, whose memories belonged to Hive. Afterwards, May visited her former husband, who had turned to Lash, before he was presented to Talbot.

May grieves over Lash's death
Later, Campbell escaped with Daisy Johnson's help. However, Phil Coulson revealed to General Talbot that this was all part of a plan: May had been secretly communicating with Campbell all along and had given him instructions to win Johnson's trust and make her believe that Campbell would join her. Instead, S.H.I.E.L.D. sent the highly dangerous Lash to Hive in an attempt to kill him, even if it put Johnson's life at risk. With Lash's help, Johnson was successfully returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. However, Lash died in the attempt, deeply saddening May who definitely lost her former husband.

Hive's Defeat
May and her team after Hive's capture
May led a team comprised of Alphonso Mackenzie, Yo-Yo Rodriguez and Lincoln Campbell to a missile silo in the Pacific Ocean who had been overrun by Hive and his Inhumans. They infiltrated the island by flying a Quinjet beneath the surface of the ocean and stormed the facility, May teaming up with Campbell. With the rest of the S.H.I.E.L.D. team, they were able to establish an uplink and used a kill code, preventing Hive to launch a missile with the Absolution Virus which would have turned everyone on Earth into Primitives. May then proceeded to the silo, where she fought two Primitives and released Holden Radcliffe. Although May failed to keep Giyera from stealing the warhead Hive needed, they successfully captured Hive himself and brought him back to the Playground. There, May delivered Radcliffe to General Glenn Talbot. However, Hive's Inhumans managed to infiltrate the Playground and released him.

After fighting Daisy Johnson, Hive captured her, stole the Zephyr One and left the Playground sieged by numerous Primitives. However, May and Leo Fitz managed to hide on the plane before it took off. They found Johnson but she refused to be released. May tried to convince her to get out of her Containment Module and fix the wrongs she had done, but before she could convince Johnson, May was knocked down by Giyera. Fortunately, Fitz killed Giyera and Johnson was released and the three S.H.I.E.L.D. agents went to a safe place, waiting for reinforcements: Phil Coulson and the rest of the team.

They all gathered in the plane's cargo bay and prepared for the final battle. They fought several Primitives before realizing that Hive was chasing Daisy. They found her and discovered that Campbell has chosen to sacrifice himself, flying a Quinjet with Hive and the warhead into space where it exploded, thus putting an end to Hive's threat. Like everyone else, May could not do anything but attend Campbell's sacrifice.

Legitimized
After Hive’s defeat, Glenn Talbot revealed the Playground’s location to the president, forcing S.H.I.E.L.D. to accept the Sokovia Accords and becoming legal again, however, Daisy Johnson left S.H.I.E.L.D. and became the vigilante known as Quake, also Phil Coulson resigned as S.H.I.E.L.D. director and replaced by Jeffrey Mace. Mace assigned May to take charge of a special strike team.

Confronting Yo-Yo Rodriguez
When Jeffrey Mace's credentials were stolen, May quickly figured out that Yo-Yo Rodriguez was the one behind it. She took her in a Quinjet and interrogated her. However, May was not against Rodriguez's personal vendetta against Victor Ramon but simply wanted to warn her that she had been careless and left tracks. May then left the Quinjet, enabling Rodriguez to fly to Baltimore instead of Los Angeles.

Haunted by a Ghost
After helping Yo-Yo to take revenge on Victor Ramon, May called Phil Coulson and Alphonso Mackenzie to the Playground to inform them about Quake's recent activities.

As May and her team trained in the Playground, Coulson and Mack suddenly arrived in the Zephyr One, after the landing, May revealed that she called the with the intention of reporting them that Quake was seen by a Aryan Brotherhood member when the Brotherhood was attacked. She also informed them that the officials are looking for Quake with the intention of kill her.

May is given a mission by Jemma Simmons
Jemma Simmons, who became Jeffrey Mace’s special advisor in science, confronted May and revealed that she know what May did and, despite saying that either both didn’t trust in Mace, Simmons sent May to get back Coulson and Mack.

May's mind is quietly infected by Lucy Bauer
May and her team later arrived in Los Angeles just as Coulson and Mack discovered that Quake was tracking a weapon transaction, May later fought the Chinatown Crew with her team, however, she was infected with a mystical infection by a ghost, later May and her team put Chen and the Crew members into custody. That morning, Coulson and May discovered that the Chinatown Crew was working for the Watchdogs, as they discussed what Mace would do to them, May knowed that Mace would talk to them directly, before seeing Coulson’s face becoming monstrous.

Losing her Sanity
May and Phil Coulson were summoned by Jeffrey Mace who was worried about Quake and her illegal actions since she had left S.H.I.E.L.D.. When Mace finally dismissed May to have a word with Coulson alone, she looked at him an also saw Mace with a monstrous face, but said nothing and left the office. She later met a delegation of Congressmen led by Mace and Coulson and once again, she saw horrifying faces. Troubled, she went to the Containment Module where Chen was locked in to know what was happening, but Chen went crazy and hit his head on the door, forcing Jemma Simmons to spread sleeping gas in the module.

May is taken to a CDC facility to be cured
May soon fell into craziness as well. As she believed everyone was infected and she was the only one who could see it, she feverishly looked for an explanation. Coulson found her in the locker room and suggested to go to the lab, but on their way, they crossed the training room where May's Team was gathered for training. Terrified by the several monstrous faces she saw, May started to fight everyone before being stopped and knocked out by Mace and his superhuman strength. Afterwards, May was transferred into a CDC facility.

Death and Resuscitation
May is revived and cured of her madness
The CDC team turned out to be incapable of treating May. When Chen died of his madness, Jeffrey Mace agreed to let Jemma Simmons handle May's case. Simmons ordered May to be brought to the Radcliffe Residence as Holden Radcliffe was S.H.I.E.L.D.'s best hope for curing May. Radcliffe sedated May and used some Framework equipment to map May's brain. Simmons and Radcliffe thus understood that May was experiencing something similar to awaken nightmares, overrunning her organism with fear and panic. Radcliffe suggested to stop May's heart to sort of reboot her brain. However, just as Simmons had to reanimate her, the power was shut down due to the Watchdogs' Blackout Attack. Simmons managed to perform CPR while Radcliffe retrieved Aida's power source and use it to power their equipment. Thus, May was successfully brought back to life, although she was not fully aware of what her organism just experienced.

May remained at the Radcliffe Residence to recover, with Aida taking care of her, even if May was unaware that Aida was an android. She was also visited by Leo Fitz who insisted on carrying further tests before being allowed to leave the residence and return on the field.

Return to Duty
South Ridge Penitentiary Riot
May caught up with what she missed during her recovering: Phil Coulson and Alphonso Mackenzie were intending to retrieve the ancient Darkhold and had enlisted the help of Ghost Rider. Coulson took May to South Ridge Penitentiary as they also needed assistance from Eli Morrow, who was imprisoned there. They met the director of the prison, but it soon turned out that Lucy Bauer and her fellow ghosts had already infected the whole prison staff, who assaulted them, believing them to be some kind of demons. May and Coulson barricaded themselves in the director's office, waiting for reinforcements.

May, Phil Coulson and Quake fight prisoners
Quake eventually rescued May and Coulson and the three of them proceeded through the penitentiary. A riot erupted among the prisoners when Bauer unlocked all the cells. As they were outnumbered, Quake decided to remain behind and stop the prisoners and locked the door behind May and Coulson, prompting them to search another access to help Quake, which they eventually did. On the way, May admitted that during her near-death experience, all she saw was Coulson himself.

The S.H.I.E.L.D. team finally exited the penitentiary only to find that Bauer had kidnapped Morrow. Back to the Playground, May went to find Quake and told her to stop trying to distance herself from the others, as Coulson would never give up on her, just like he did for May.

Obtaining the Darkhold
May led a S.H.I.E.L.D. team to the Momentum Labs facility only to find that the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who where guarding the place had been killed by Lucy Bauer. May and Leo Fitz then tried to determine Bauer's plans and whereabouts. Thanks to the clues found by May at Momentum Labs, Fitz guided the team to an abandoned Roxxon Corporation power plant. May joined Phil Coulson, Alphonso Mackenzie, Ghost Rider and Fitz at the power plant in an effort to stop Bauer. May and Coulson found some sophisticated equipment as well as the Darkhold. Coulson trusted May with the Book of Spells and ordered her to bring it back to the Quinjet. May then tried to go back to the facility and attended a massive energy outburst due to Eli Morrow performing his experiment to gain matter creation powers.

Friends Gone Missing
May searches the facility for her friends
May and Alphonso Mackenzie returned to the Roxxon Corporation power plant after the outburst and discovered that Phil Coulson, Leo Fitz and Ghost Rider were missing. They also found out that Eli Morrow had killed four S.H.I.E.L.D. agents before escaping. May returned to the Zephyr One, where she watched the video feed showing the complete disappearance of Coulson, Fitz and Reyes. After discussing with Jeffrey Mace, the team decided to call for Jemma Simmons' help. In the meantime, May reclaimed the Darkhold and told Mackenzie that she had a feeling that their friends were not dead and that she intended to use the Darkhold to find them. However, Mackenzie advised her against it and Mace ordered all the equipment seized at the power plant to be brought back to the Playground, where Holden Radcliffe awaited.

May sees Phil Coulson and Leo Fitz in danger
May told Radcliffe that the Darkhold might contain answers to their problem. However, Radcliffe, after reading just a little bit, refused to go further, stating that it was way too dangerous, despite May's insisting. May then decided to read it herself, but Radcliffe advised her against it and Aida offered to read the Darkhold, prompting Radcliffe to admit that Aida was actually a android. With the newly acquired knowledge and despite May's doubts, Aida built an Inter-Dimensional Gate. When it opened, May saw that Coulson and Fitz were in danger, on the verge of being aspired into the Dark Dimension region known as Hell. They eventually managed to escape through the gateway, much to May's relief.

Later, Coulson and May discussed what happened and decided that they would open Nick Fury's bottle of Haig when Morrow's threat would have been dealt with. They also attended Quake's departure from the Playground.

Kidnapped by Aida
May is kept sedated by Aida
While S.H.I.E.L.D. was preparing for a final assault on Eli Morrow, Jeffrey Mace ordered May to go to the Radcliffe Residence and to enlist Aida's assistance as she had proven herself to be a valuable asset. May never returned since she was kidnapped by Aida and replaced by a Life-Model Decoy, in an attempt to reclaim the Darkhold for Holden Radcliffe. May was kept sedated in the Radcliffe Residence, where agent Nathan B. Nathanson found her before being killed by Aida. Later, May was connected to the Framework.

Framework
Near-Escape
May is sedated by Aida once more
To sedate May, Aida hooked her up to a version of the Framework, where she experienced a spa treatment. However, the tranquil environment was completely unsuitable for a warrior like May, and any attempt to leave caused the program to awkwardly reset itself, raising May's suspicions and eventually causing her to wake up. Aida intercepted and, with her superior strength, quickly overpowered May, and only Holden Radcliffe's intervention prevented Aida from snapping May's neck. Radcliffe realized that a stereotypical calm environment was unsuitable for May, and so decided to place her in an environment where she would have "a dragon to fight".

Caught in a Loop
May tries to escape in a simulation
Aida and Holden Radcliffe set up a new Framework simulation for May. In this version, May believed that she woke up and took advantage of Aida's distraction to unstrap her and try to leave the Radcliffe Residence. She would then fight Aida and escape the Residence. During one simulation, Aida informed May that each time the simulation reset, she would go further into the simulation due to memory traces, making it hard for Aida's programming to keep up. May smiled and assumed she would eventually go far enough to fully wake up, but she never reached that point and Aida kept resetting the simulation, coding it further to its next step.

Sparing Katya
As May kept going further in the Framework simulations, Aida and Holden Radcliffe finally reached the final step in creating an efficient way to keep May sedated. Indeed, thanks to the Darkhold, Aida recreated the entire world inside the Framework and removed May's biggest regret in her life: having killed Katya Belyakov.

Thus, in the new version of the Rescue in Bahrain, May would not kill the girl. Instead, she would succeed in saving her. However, this would lead to the infamous Cambridge Incident, which would in turn catalyze HYDRA rise in power in the world of the Framework. As May was the one who enabled Katya to go to the United States, she felt responsible and was soon influenced by HYDRA anti-Inhumans propaganda: thus, May, one of the best S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in the real world, became a fierce HYDRA agent in the Framework.

HYDRA Agent
After Daisy Johnson plugged herself into the Framework to rescue her friends, including May, who were trapped in it, May found her at the Triskelion and, mistaking her for her colleague Skye, summoned her to a briefing. During this briefing, May informed her team that HYDRA had captured an Inhuman named Jason Rajan and ordered Johnson and Grant Ward, who was also a HYDRA agent, to interrogate him. May attended the interrogation and pressured Johnson into getting answers. She then joined the interrogation and got angered when Rajan, actually Vijay Nadeer, mentioned the Cambridge Incident. After considering killing Nadeer, May ordered him to be delivered to The Doctor.

Later, May went to see The Doctor himself to inform him that Phil Coulson, a teacher in the Framework, had reported a subversive. The Doctor ordered May to chase her, but she failed and informed The Doctor about it, suspecting the presence of a mole within HYDRA. May assured The Doctor that she would find the traitor, although he doubted May's capabilities.

May took Johnson to another briefing during which The Doctor explained that they were chasing Jemma Simmons. Afterwards, May led a team, including Johnson, to a house in order to arrest its inhabitants, who turned out to be Alphonso Mackenzie and his daughter Hope. They were taken to the Triskelion, where May interrogated Mackenzie and threatened to hurt his daughter so that he would be willing to do anything to prove his innocence. May subsequently used Mackenzie to lure Johnson into admitting that she was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. May arrested Johnson and locked her in a cell before releasing Mackenzie and Hope.

Defecting from HYDRA
As she was staring at a memorial for the Cambridge Incident, May was found by Madame Hydra: after a brief conversation, May volunteered to test a new weapon designed to enforce HYDRA's reign of terror. She headed to the lab where Kenneth Turgeon disclosed his latest design: a super-serum which would give her enough strength to go toe-to-toe with the Patriot, the leader of the S.H.I.E.L.D. resistance, and May grinned at this perspective.

May fights the Patriot
May got an opportunity to test the super-serum when S.H.I.E.L.D. assaulted a HYDRA Enlightenment Cultivation Center. After being injected the super-serum by The Doctor, she flied to the facility and faced the Patriot. After a violent fight, May was defeated. She informed her superiors, who ordered her to destroy the quarantine building where the Patriot had fled. Once the missile hit its target, May activated her Body Cam and entered the building to confirm the Patriot's demise. On her way, she encountered several children and teenagers, making her wondering why they were here. She eventually found the Patriot, along with Phil Coulson, Jemma Simmons, Grant Ward and Antoine Triplett. They managed to convince May not to shoot the Patriot as he was trying to save Chris Adler, another child. As the building was on the verge of fully collapsing, May got out, but not before exchanging a look with the Patriot, who was sacrificing himself to ensure everyone's escape.

Seeing her enemy giving his life for her deeply affected May. This, combined with the discovery that HYDRA had been forcefully indoctrinating children, caused her to defect from HYDRA. She went to Johnson's cell and shattered a Terrigen Crystal, triggering Johnson's Terrigenesis so that she would gain her powers and escape the Triskelion.

Making Amends
Once Daisy Johnson's Terrigenesis completed, May and Johnson made their way through the Triskelion, getting rid of many HYDRA operatives in the process. They stumbled on Madame Hydra who tried to stop them, but Johnson used her newly recovered powers on her, severely injuring her, and the two managed to escape the Triskelion. They hid in the streets, trying to get to safety, and May informed Johnson about the Patriot's death. They finally reached a rendezvous point to go to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s base but were found by a HYDRA squad. However, with help from Phil Coulson, Alphonso Mackenzie and Burrows, they managed to get out and finally reached the Playground.

May offered to hand over the footage of her Body Cam to S.H.I.E.L.D. to make up for her actions while she was a HYDRA agent: the images of the Patriot saving the lives of children and teenagers would weaken HYDRA's influence. S.H.I.E.L.D. then put in place an operation to attack the HYDRA Broadcasting Center. May helped Coulson to prepare for making a live statement, calling for an open rebellion: while doing so, they both had a feeling of déjà vu, without being able to know where it came from. Once the broadcasting began, May and the others left the building, having dealt a crippling blow to HYDRA.

Escape
May returned to the Playground where she looked after some refugees. She was approached by Phil Coulson, who chose to disclose the whole story about the fallacy of the Framework. Evidently, May did not believe him and demanded evidence for Coulson's theory as she was done blindly following other people. Later, Jemma Simmons came to May as well and told her the same thing than Coulson. Simmons mentioned the fact that in the real world, Leo Fitz was a colleague of theirs, which May greatly doubted due to Fitz's position in the Framework. May also mentioned Fitz's father, Alistair Fitz and gave his address to Simmons.

While May was chatting with Coulson, Daisy Johnson asked them whether they knew about Simmons' whereabouts, to which May replied that she had gone to Alistair's place. May also told Johnson that she knew about the whole "fake world" theory. Nevertheless, she agreed to join a mission involving Coulson, Johnson, Antoine Triplett, Alphonso Mackenzie and Simmons, who finally got back. The team flied to a steel mill where the Framework backdoor built by Holden Radcliffe was supposed to be. They found the place, but it was hidden beneath a pool of molten steel. An argument erupted as Mackenzie did not know anything about the real world and May was still doubtful about it.

The situation went worse when a HYDRA squad stormed the steel mill. Despite the fight, Johnson managed to reveal the backdoor. When Coulson was shot on his way to the backdoor, May reached him and was convinced that the only chance of saving him was pushing him through the portal. After hesitating for a few moments, May jumped as well and finally woke up in the real world. May and Coulson woke up at Anton Ivanov's submarine base, and they were soon joined by Fitz, who woke up as well although he was terribly distressed because of his behavior in the Framework. Soon after, Aida came to the room, having achieved her goal of acquiring a real human body. May tried to shoot her, but Fitz got in her aim and was too shocked to move away. Before May could take the shot, Aida teleported away.

Back to the Real World
May fights the Superior
May and Coulson quickly figured out that they were trapped in a submarine base full of multiple mechanical bodies of Anton Ivanov. They destroyed one and locked themselves in the room to resist the others. As they were looking for another way out, May took advantage of the moment to catch up with all the events she had missed since she had been kidnapped by Aida before the confrontation with Eli Morrow. She was also told about Ivanov and the fact that she had been replaced by a Life-Model Decoy. May found some epinephrine and decided to use it to strengthen herself to fight the androids. This proved to be successful, however, it left May in a weakened state afterwards.

May is arrested by General Glenn Talbot
When Ivanov triggered the base's destruction, Coulson managed to take May to the surface, where they were rescued by the Zephyr One. Thanks to Aida's unexpected help, the whole S.H.I.E.L.D. team was fully reunited aboard the plane and flied back to the completely destroyed Playground. May joined the others while they were trying to figure out what to do with Aida: May was not willing to kill her as she had saved Alphonso Mackenzie and there had been enough deaths already. The conversation was interrupted when Jemma Simmons broke down due to her fear of having losing Leo Fitz and his love. However, Aida, who did not remain long on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s side, was not the only threat. General Glenn Talbot arrived to the Playground and intended to arrest everyone, but due to Aida having gone mad, he agreed to let them go and May flew the Zephyr One away.

When Ghost Rider made his unexpected return, May reclaimed the severed head of Sergei Mishkin's Life-Model Decoy. They discovered that Mishkin was supposed to attend an International Inquiry Committee and flied there, only to find that Aida and her LMDs were ahead of S.H.I.E.L.D. and had tried to kill Talbot. Nevertheless, May and Coulson reclaimed the Darkhold. Back on the place, May and the others figured out Aida's plan: recreating the dictatorship she ruled over in the Framework but this time in the real world by growing hatred towards S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Inhumans.

May flied the Zephyr One back to the Playground and S.H.I.E.L.D. lured Aida into a trap which eventually led to her death. After Ghost Rider returned to the Dark Dimension and Fitz apologized for what had happened, offering to take the blame for all the team, May joined the others into forgiving him and claiming that they had to remain together. May and the others then went to Rae's Restaurant for a nice a quiet dinner. Calm did not last long, however, as the whole team but Fitz was kidnapped by Enoch.

Trapped in the Future
Painful Arrival
Through the Time Di'Alla, May was sent to a mysterious destination. Unfortunately, her teleportation ended with a pipe planted in her leg. May painfully extracted the pipe and hid in the room as Deke Shaw, a man wearing a mask, entered. May saw Shaw searching dead bodies in the room and extracting devices out of their wrist. Shaw eventually found May and the two brutally fought one another until Shaw used an anti-gravity device to pin May against a wall. Shaw gagged May and tied her up before forcefully implanting her with one of the devices he had previously reclaimed, calling them Metrics. He then took May away.

S.H.I.E.L.D. interrogates Deke Shaw
Shaw and May later found Phil Coulson, Daisy Johnson and Jemma Simmons who had been locked in a cell by the Kree ruling the Lighthouse. Shaw convinced the Kree to let them go and explained that he had been paid by Virgil, another inhabitant of the Lighthouse (which May and the others thought to be a space station) to hide them, but since Virgil was dead, he considered the deal cancelled. May and the others disagreed and May used Deke's anti-gravity device to pin him to a wall. Shaw reluctantly disclosed the location of a spaceship, the Trawler, that May and Simmons were to use to send a signal to Earth and call for backup. On their way, May and Simmons hypothesized that the Lighthouse was a Kree base designed for an invasion of Earth.

However, it turned out that the truth was much more disturbing. Indeed, after successfully flying the Trawler into space, May and Simmons discovered that they had not been through space but through time, to a future in which Earth had been completely destroyed.

Discovering the Truth
May and Jemma Simmons returned the Trawler to the Lighthouse and reunited with Phil Coulson, who had made the same discovery than them by talking with Deke Shaw. They later met Tess, Virgil's friend, who was told about the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents coming from the past. Tess guided them throughout the Lighthouse to the Exchange, telling them about the life in the Lighthouse and how the Kree were ruling the place. May and Simmons remained at the Exchange while Coulson and Tess left. They attended a food distribution during which Reese, a human servant to the Kree, was wounded. May helped Simmons tend to his wounds, which drew the attention of Sinara, a high-ranking Kree who took Simmons away without May being able to interfere.

May reported the event to the rest of the team and they decided to further investigate the place in order to get Simmons back. May asked Tess if she could help her change her bandage, leaving with her while the rest of the team stole a Kree tablet. A Renewal then took place in the Lighthouse: Tess explained to May that some survivors would have to fight to the death. Worried about her friends, May went to the Salvage and found Holt, one of the designated survivors, who was threatening the lives of Coulson, Alphonso Mackenzie and Yo-Yo Rodriguez. May fought him until he was eventually killed by Tess.

A Mysterious Signal
May works with Tess
Like some of her teammates, May was hired by Grill, the manager of the Salvag], and teamed up with Tess to bring supplies with the Trawler. Phil Coulson and Alphonso Mackenzie managed to join one of May's missions so that they could fly the Trawler to coordinates left by Virgil. However, they had to deal with the fact that Zev, Grill's right-hand man, was also on the mission. During the flight, May and Coulson had a tender conversation and held hands, and May expressed her desire to go home and rest after her long experience in the Framework. She flied the Trawler to Virgil's coordinates and they found some radio equipment aboard the spaceship. However, Zev interfered and tried to stop them, but May managed to stall until Mackenzie knocked Zev unconscious.

Finally, the team managed to receive a radio transmission which appeared to come from the destroyed surface of the Earth. However, May had to quickly return the Trawler to the Lighthouse as Zev sabotaged the fuel line. Once back, Zev told Grill about what had happened, threatening the lives of May and the others, but Yo-Yo Rodriguez managed to distract Grill and successfully made him believe that Zev was stealing from him, prompting Grill to spare their lives and doom Zev instead. Later, May was with the others when they decrypted the transmission which seemed to indicate that there were people on the surface on the Earth who knew about S.H.I.E.L.D. coming from the past.

Deke Shaw's Betrayal
As all the Trawler flights were cancelled for an unknown reason, May joined her teammates at the Salvage and they discussed their best options to find Jemma Simmons and Daisy Johnson, who were both missing. May and Phil Coulson went to find Deke Shaw in order to enlist his help to access a high security Kree level of the Lighthouse. Shaw told them that he had met Johnson and that she had decided to go dark to save Simmons. In the end, he reluctantly agreed to help them.

May prepares to fight Sinara
May, Coulson and Shaw accessed level 35 and discovered that it was a Kree lab in which the Kree were artificially breeding human babies with Inhuman powers. By searching into the lab's files, May discovered that Johnson was a captive of the Kree and deduced that Shaw was involved in her capture. May punched Shaw and she and Coulson confronted him, but before he could explain himself, two Kree guards arrived in the lab. They fought and killed them but Shaw was wounded in the process. When Sinara arrived as well in the lab, May remained while Coulson and Shaw ran away. May and Sinara fiercely fought but May's wound still weakened her and she was ultimately defeated by Sinara, who got on the verge of killing her.

In the Arena
May prepares to duel against Ben
Sinara ultimately spared May's life and brought her back to Kasius, who decided to employ her as a fighter in his arena, where she would fight Inhumans. May was brought to the arena to fight Ben and was surprised to see that Leo Fitz was attending the duel. Wielding a battle staff, May had trouble fighting Ben due to her still painful wound and the fight that Ben could read her mind and thus predict her moves. Ben knew that May was a friend of Daisy Johnson and Jemma Simmons but had no choice but fight her. Although May managed to best Ben's ability on several occasions, she was defeated by the Inhuman. Fitz intervened in the fight, claiming it was boring and advising Kasius to send May to the surface of the Earth, to which Kasius complied. May thanked Fitz for that.

Meeting Enoch
May is found by Earth
Upon being sent to the surface of the Earth, May was chased by Vrellnexians. While hiding from one of them, she saw the creature being killed by Enoch. Enoch introduced himself and explained that he had been sent by Leo Fitz to help May and the others. Enoch also warned May that a gravity storm was coming and May noticed that the Vrellnexians seemed to be afraid of something and were running away. The storm came upon them but May and Enoch were anchored on the ground my mysterious individuals.

May fainted and woke up in some secret base, where she identified the S.H.I.E.L.D. symbol and quickly figured out that she was in the remnants of the Zephyr One. Then, two masked individuals came to her room, accompanying an elderly woman carrying a wooden robin: the future Robin Hinton.

Mother in Another Time
May asked Robin Hinton about the reason of her presence, but Samuel Voss explained that it was hard for Hinton to give clear answers as her mind mixed past, present and future together. Voss also informed May that her friends were on the way to the Zephyr One, something he knew for a decade thanks to a vision from Hinton. Indeed, May got the chance to welcome her friends into the plane some time later.

May tries to get answers from Robin Hinton
May informed Phil Coulson about the presence of Hinton. They went to see her as she was talking with Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons, who were not more successful than May. Still, May and Coulson tried to get some answers, but could not really progress other than the fact that what had happened at Rae's Restaurant was the last time the S.H.I.E.L.D. was seen together. Before they left, Hinton also voiced an ominous warning, stating this was the day things were supposed to end.

May finds a piece of the Time Di'Alla
May and Coulson gave Hinton a break before asking her again. They asked Enoch for help, but the Chronicom could not assist them much as he had always needed days before getting answers from Hinton. May began to doubt their chances to sort things out and as she was arguing with Coulson, Hinton came and gave them another drawing picturing the Zephyr One flying across space debris. May and Coulson then went to see Voss in the armory, where they discovered a shard of the Time Di'Alla. They brought the shard to Fitz and Simmons, who figured out they could use it to return in their time provided they could find other fragments.

Robin Hinton dies in May's arms
However, the True Believers turned on the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, intending to keep them from returning to their time to prevent the Destruction of Earth. May and Coulson defeated their opponents and rushed at Johnson and Hinton, only to find out that the latter had been stabbed by Voss. May held Hinton in her arms and the elderly woman subtly revealed that in her timeline, May had adopted and raised her following Polly Hinton's death. Before dying, Hinton disclosed the key to the return of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in their time: the Inhuman Flint.

Upgraded Zephyr One
May talks about Robin Hinton
May worked with the rest of the S.H.I.E.L.D. team to repair the Zephyr One so it could fly again, although the task proved to be difficult. Upon finding drawings from Robin Hinton, May admitted to Phil Coulson that she found it hard to believe that she had adopted and raised Hinton, although both Coulson and Daisy Johnson were convinced that May would have been a good mother. May also asked about what they should do with Samuel Voss who was their prisoner.

As the gravity storm approached and the plane was ready to go, May prepared to pilot the Zephyr One through the storm. However, the engines were heavily damaged, forcing the agents to consider seeking refuge in the Earth's caves. However, Jemma Simmons revealed that the Zephyr One had been upgraded with Gravitonium powered thrusters, which they could use along with the gravity storm to flight despite not having engines. May and the others agreed to follow this plan.

May flies the Zephyr One in space
Expressing annoyance at Enoch's repeated comments about their impending death, May reached the piloting station and moved to release the ground anchors, but some of them remained stuck in the ground, blocking the Zephyr One. However, the gravity storm finally reached the plane, taking it to the sky. May waited to reach a high enough altitude to activate the thrusters, which stabilized the plane in outer space, enabling S.H.I.E.L.D. to safely return to the Lighthouse. Once in space, the team contacted Alphonso Mackenzie to prepare their arrival.

Back to the Lighthouse
May successfully took the Zephyr One near the Lighthouse and left the plane along with the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in the Containment Module, leaving only Enoch to guard the plane and prepare the machine for the Time Di'Alla. The team split up and May remained with Phil Coulson, Daisy Johnson and Deke Shaw. They attacked a group of Kree guardians escorting Inhumans, killing the guards and sending the prisoners to the Trawler, where they found a revived Tess, who took the survivors with her.

The team was contacted by Enoch, who informed them that he had been located by the Kree Watch and could not hold them off for a long time. May suggested to go and help them, but Shaw decided to go himself as the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents needed to be ready for the activation of the Time Di'Alla.

May went to an elevator to join the rendezvous point with Johnson and Coulson. However, Johnson revealed that she would not come with them as she could not risk to go back and trigger the Destruction of Earth. May tried to convince her to go anyway and that they would change the future once they are home, but to no avail, forcing Coulson to incapacitate Johnson to force her to come with them.

May waits for the Time Di'Alla
May reached Kasius' Suites where she encountered Flint, who was supposed to build the Time Di'Alla. May watched as the Monolith was being built. She then waited for the Monolith to be activated by using Enoch's internal battery. Before they were sent back in their time, May warned Coulson that Johnson would never forgive him for forcing her back into the past.

Back in the Present
Infiltration into St. Louis Aerospace Facility
May is informed of the Monoliths by Noah
Along with the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, May was sent back into her time by the Time Di'Alla, expressing considerable relief at the idea of being back. They arrived in the present day Lighthouse, where they were welcomed by a recorded message from General Rick Stoner. Following his instructions, May and Leo Fitz explored the Lighthouse and found a storage room, where May was shocked to discover three Monoliths, including the White one. As they wondered about their presence, they were approached by a Chronicom, Noah.

S.H.I.E.L.D. team decide to go to St. Louis
Noah explained to May and Fitz that he had been monitoring various unusual events from the Lighthouse. While reviewing Noah's equipment, May noticed a screen showing beams of light seemingly coming from the sky, which was a first sign of the end of the world according to Samuel Voss. Therefore, May alerted Phil Coulson and the whole team about it. Noah then informed them that the light beam was located in St. Louis, prompting the team to leave the Lighthouse through secret tunnels in order to go there and investigate.

May and the team find the Kree Orb
Exiting the tunnels, May and the team arrived in the small city of River's End, where they borrowed a van in order to go incognito and drove to the location where Fitz had left the cloaked Zephyr One. Much to her delight, May got to fly the S.H.I.E.L.D. aircraft to St. Louis, where the S.H.I.E.L.D. team entered an aerospace facility in which they expected to find the Kree Orb, which had been identified as the source of the beams by Fitz and Jemma Simmons. Once inside the facility, which was deserted, the team found the Kree Orb reconnected with Agent Piper.

May listens to Piper's story
Piper explained that she had recognized the Kree Orb's signal days ago and that she had come to investigate as well, also informing them that she had searched for her S.H.I.E.L.D. colleagues but to no avail. Eventually, Fitz and Simmons were able to disconnect a man-made timer attached to the Kree Orb. At this point, Piper revealed that she had struck a deal with General Hale, who was hunting down S.H.I.E.L.D., and May soon found herself and the team ambushed by a group of androids led by a mysterious feminine figure, who forced May and her colleagues to drop their weapons.
