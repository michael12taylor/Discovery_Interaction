<html><p>Noticing a call, T'Challa walked over to W'Kabi who arrived for Ulysses Klaue's return for his crimes. When asked if he brought Klaue, T'Challa told W'Kabi that Klaue was slipped through from their hands. Seeing W'Kabi disappointed, T'Challa was told that when his father took over as King for thirty years, he did nothing and having his friend would be different. Watching W'Kabi leave, T'Challa was left in distraught on how close he apprehended Klaue.

Skeletons in the Closet
T'Challa demands the truth about his father
T'Challa confronted Zuri and demanded the truth about N'Jobu, whom T'Chaka said disappeared one day. He went on to explain the arrival of a man wearing his grandfather's royal ring who helped Ulysses Klaue escape from capture. Zuri, hesitant, stated that he had promised T'Chaka, his former king, he would not tell of N'Jobu's fate, but T'Challa furiously stated he is the current King of Wakanda.

T'Challa listens to Zuri about the truth
Reluctantly, Zuri explained that N'Jobu fell in love with an American woman while on a War Dog assignment, and was discovered through Zuri to have hired Klaue less than thirty years ago to steal vibranium from the country to aid in the civil unrest in America after witnessing the tragedies happening to the African Americans there. N'Jobu was upset that T'Chaka couldn't understand the need to share the rare metal with the rest of the Africans in the world.

T'Challa discovers the truth about his uncle
When T'Chaka ordered his brother to return and face punishment, N'Jobu pulled a gun on Zuri for betraying him but was quickly disarmed and killed by T'Chaka, leaving the king heartbroken, ordering Zuri to keep his actions a secret. Zuri explained that T'Chaka knew of N'Jobu's child with the American woman, but decided to leave the boy behind to maintain the lie that N'Jobu disappeared. T'Challa was left appalled by his father's action of lying about his uncle and orphaning his cousin.

T'Challa listens to Nakia for advice
Sitting near a cliff with Nakia, T'Challa talked to her about his father killing his uncle and left his cousin, a child, behind with nothing, questioning why would he would do such thing. T'Challa was told by Nakia that no man is perfect. T'Challa realizes that his father never gave him a proper burial, after his uncle betrayed their family, thinking he may have created something even worse. Despite his concern, Nakia advises T'Challa that he must not let his father's mistakes determine what T'Challa will do as the king.

T'Challa learns about his cousin's background
Having a call from his Kimoyo bead, T'Challa was informed by Shuri that she had some important news that he must attend to the lab. Having been joined by Everett Ross and Shuri, T'Challa listened to the group on everything he knew of Erik Stevens' background as a member of a highly trained section of the United States Navy SEALs where he got a reputation as a killer, nicknamed Killmonger. While Ross explains and the other Wakandans listened closely, T'Challa began looking at Killmonger's record.

Fight for the Throne
Meeting Erik Killmonger
T'Challa notices Erik Killmonger's arrival
Returning to the Golden City, T'Challa held a meeting with the Tribal Council, when Erik Killmonger was brought up to the council with W'Kabi, who was presented with Ulysses Klaue's corpse at the border of Wakanda, much to T'Challa's surprise.

T'Challa personally confronts Erik Killmonger
Once Killmonger was invited to speak, T'Challa was told that he is standing in the room, further noting that he had served justice to Wakandans by killing Klaue who had been responsible for the previous Attack on Wakanda and had stolen vibranium, telling to council that he was able to deliver justice to the country. Angered by this insult, T'Challa got up from his throne and personally confronted Killmonger, walking up to him, closely followed by Okoye. T'Challa pointedly clarified that he doesn't care about him bringing Klaue and the only reason he didn't kill him where he stands is that he knew who Killmonger really was.

T'Challa asks for Erik Killmonger's motives
Asking a question, T'Challa listened to Killmonger, saying that he wanted the throne. Noticing the council was sitting down comfortably, Killmonger told T'Challa that two billion people all over the world that look like his ethnicity, saying their lives are a lot harder and Wakanda has the tools to liberate. T'Challa then asked for what kind of tools is Killmonger wanting, abruptly told that it was vibranium. Aggressively, T'Challa responded that he will wage war on the world.

T'Challa is asked for Erik Killmonger's name
T'Challa would counter that it is not Wakanda's way to be judge, jury, and executioner for people who are not their own. Killmonger retorted by asking that life started in right on the continent of Africa, all people should be his people. T'Challa responded that he is not King of all people, only a King of Wakanda, telling it was his responsibility to make sure his people are safe and that vibranium does not fall into the hands of a person like Killmonger.

T'Challa accepts Erik Killmonger's challenge
Demanding the king to ask his name, T'Challa dismiss Killmonger's request and told his guards to take him away. However, when the River Tribe Elder asked for Killmonger's identity, Killmonger told what his name was N'Jadaka and was the son of N'Jobu in Xhosa, taking T'Challa by surprise. With evidence by W'Kabi showing his ring, T'Challa was challenged for the throne and the Black Panther mantle. Pondering on the idea, T'Challa decided to accept the challenge.

Killmonger's Challenge
T'Challa warns Erik Killmonger to not fight
As they had prepared for the duel, T'Challa and Erik Killmonger were both taken to Warrior Falls where Killmonger was then given his spear and sword, while the Tribal Council watched closely. Zuri used a potion to stripped T'Challa's powers of the Black Panther strength, leaving them on equal footing ready for the challenge.

T'Challa fighting against Erik Killmonger
Once he stood back up, T'Challa gave Killmonger one final chance to lay down all his weapons so they could handle the situation another way. Instead, Killmonger then removed his Bulletproof Vest and shirt, revealing his tribal Crocodile Scarring, and told him how he had lived his entire life for this one moment, noting how he had killed all across the world, including Afghanistan, Iraq, and Africa, just so that he could kill T'Challa. With everything in place, Zuri had then announced that the challenge could begin as T'Challa immediately began on the defensive as Killmonger attacked him by swinging his weapons, landing a deadly blow against him.

T'Challa defends himself from Erik Killmonger
With all of Killmonger's military training allowed him to push him back, T'Challa soon found that his skills with the tribal weapons took the advantage as he managed to lock Killmonger into a block and held him back, using his shield to defend himself. As Killmonger became frustrated, T'Challa endured several heavy strikes that were landed against him repeatedly, in an attempt to beat him into submission. However, T'Challa was able to use all Killmonger's rage against him, knocking him off balance and onto his back, telling Killmonger to yield the duel.

T'Challa is wounded by Erik Killmonger
After Killmonger refused to back down once he got back onto his feet, T'Challa continued gaining the advantage as he sliced Killmonger across the face with a non-fatal strike. When Killmonger stood back up, T'Challa continued to gain the upper hand at first, eventually, Killmonger was able to land a heavy kick and managed to slice T'Challa across his inner thigh. Once he was hurt, T'Challa was beaten down before being sliced across the chest and arm.

T'Challa loudly mourns over Zuri's death
When T'Challa then attempted to punch Killmonger, T'Challa was easily beaten down in front of his horrified family. Killmonger then raised his blade and prepared to execute T'Challa, telling him that it would in revenge for T'Chaka killing his own father. Before Killmonger could deliver the final blow, Zuri intervened, claiming that he was truly responsible for his father's death and that he should take his life instead. Despite that, T'Challa told Zuri to not stop the duel, Killmonger happily obliged.

T'Challa is thrown out into the waterfall
Distraught over Zuri's untimely death, T'Challa lunged at Killmonger once more but missed. As Killmonger stood over, T'Challa was now unable to get up as he called out to those watching and claimed that T'Challa would never be able to lead them and was unworthy of being Black Panther. Once he finally gathered enough strength to try and fight back, T'Challa was picked up on his feet before throwing him off the side of Warrior Falls and landed into shore.

Saved by the Jabari Tribe
T'Challa is found and saved in Jabari Land
Flowing all the water shores, T'Challa was found in the Jabari Land in the freezing rivers where their fisherman was doing their labor and brought him back to their domain. M'Baku decided to save his life as repayment for his mercy at the falls earlier. Unconscious, T'Challa was in a comatose state and covered in snow before almost dying from the wounds he endured.

T'Challa entering in the Ancestral Plane
Once Nakia, Ramonda, Shuri, and Everett Ross had escaped from Erik Killmonger's consolidated power, they were taken into M'Baku's chamber and attempted to give away one the Heart-Shaped Herbs. M'Baku then had shown T'Challa in his comatose condition, stabilized by the surrounding snow, Ramonda remembered to use the herb to bring him back. Awaking in the Ancestral Plane, T'Challa was greeted by T'Chaka and invited to join him and the rest of his ancestors.

T'Challa swears on taking the mantle back
Instead of staying with his father, T'Challa was furious at T'Chaka for what happened to his uncle and cousin and angered by the other Black Panthers for how their strict isolationism has led to suffering around the world. T'Challa declared his work wasn't done yet and must take the mantle back and write the wrongs of his father. In the brisk of the cold climate, T'Challa woke up in the relief of his loved ones, looking at everyone in his direction and asked for a blanket as they laughed and smiled from his remark.

Agreement with M'Baku
T'Challa declares on taking the mantle back
Once he had rested in M'Baku's land until morning dawn, T'Challa was informed that Erik Killmonger was reigning supreme in Wakanda, having the full support of the military and burned the garden of the Heart-Shaped Herb, as he was trained to destabilize foreign countries. Informed that their weapons will be sent all over the world, T'Challa declared that he must get his family out of Wakanda safely, saying that his challenge will have to continue.

T'Challa joins forces with his allies
Arguing that his duty is to keep his people safe, T'Challa responds that if Killmonger gets control over their technology, nowhere will be safe. When Shuri got up from her seat, T'Challa was given his silver necklace that will equip his Panther Habit, saying that the Black Panther lives and will be right there beside him, as Nakia and Everett Ross decided to join in the fight alongside him. As they have a moment of uniting as a team, T'Challa was caught off guard when M'Baku was yawning very loudly and asking them if they were done talking before they take action. 

T'Challa request for M'Baku's tribe to fight
Ordering his family, Nakia, and Ross to leave the room for privacy, T'Challa thanked M'Baku for saving his life as they both gained truce once M'Baku expressed he spared his life in their duel for the throne. Once they were settled down, T'Challa requested that his mother to stay with his land and he and the rest of the Jabari Tribe would help overthrow Killmonger, M'Baku agreed with his statement but in a serious manner, he quickly declined.

T'Challa leaves M'Baku to himself
Saying that he is the first King to come for his tribe in centuries, M'Baku questions that he spoke for his tribe, T'Challa retorted that he can't speak for all the Kings in the past but with Killmonger on the throne, he proposed who will be next the group of people to overthrow. With M'Baku declining to help, T'Challa and his group left the tribe, with Panther Habit prepared for the coming battle.

Battle for Wakanda
Black Panther returns to battle in Wakanda
Preparing for battle, T'Challa went over to Wakanda while Nakia, Shuri, and Everett Ross secretly go over there to sneak around the Great Mound. As Erik Killmonger and the Border Tribe prepared to deliver vibranium weapons to War Dogs around the world, T'Challa destroyed the aircraft, crashing into the ground.

Black Panther challenges Erik Killmonger
With the aircraft on fire, T'Challa emerged from the debris and removed his mask to reveal his identity. T'Challa then walked over the field and yelled at Killmonger, shouting his real name and that he never yielded nor was killed in his challenge with him. Despite that, Killmonger stated that the Ritual Combat was over, Killmonger ordered W'Kabi to kill T'Challa and the Border Tribe began to charge at him. At this defiance of the challenge, Okoye and the Dora Milaje considered Killmonger's claim to the throne now forfeited and turned against him in defence of T'Challa as the rightful King. Black Panther called Shuri to move along inside the lab and began to fight the Border Tribe.

Black Panther subdues multiple soldiers
When the Border Tribe's use of defense shields, T'Challa jumped over them and used his kinetic pulse to release, resulting into exploding on impact, grabbing onto one of the soldiers' Sonic Spears and threw it at one of the aircraft. As the destruction started to brew more attention, half of the Dora Milaje were sent down to battle out W'Kabi's men, fighting for the King. On the brink of the battle, T'Challa subdued many of W'Kabi's soldiers that were attacking him.

Black Panther chases down a White Rhino
As the battle when on, T'Challa took off his mask and confronted W'Kabi, telling him to stop his soldier's from fighting, but refusing to listen to him, W'Kabi continued to blow on his airhorn, much to T'Challa shouting no to him. As the Border tribe members shout over the airhorn, the White Rhinoceros began to huddle in groups and crash into the broken aircraft that T'Challa recently destroyed. After the Rhinos hit several Dora Milije members, T'Challa chased one of them down and grabbed its horn, subduing it onto the ground as the piece of debris had pinned it down

T'Challa seeing Shuri being attacked
Continued to battle, T'Challa fought against several of W'Kabi's soldiers until one of the rhinos hit him so hard that flew across the field and landed onto the ground near a rock. As Killmonger, wearing the other Panther Habit, defeated Okoye and three of the Dora Milaje members, he turned his attention to Shuri. Seeing this, T'Challa released his kinetic pulse and began to charge at Killmonger, tackling him, causing both to fall into the Great Mound.

T'Challa tells Shuri to turn on the train
As they proceeded to fall several stories high, T'Challa began to trade blows with Killmonger in between to get away from each other, resulting into him landing onto the railroad of the Wakandan Maglev Train. On the platform, T'Challa dodged an incoming attack by Killmonger and fought on the tracks of one of the vibranium transport trains. T'Challa asked Shuri to activate the train, knowing it would activate the Sonic Stabilizers, rendering his, and Killmonger's suits useless from time-to-time.

T'Challa arguing at Erik Killmonger's reign
After the railroad was activated, T'Challa was able swiftly to avoid the train while Killmonger began to attack him outright. As the two escaped from the railroad, T'Challa noticed that his suit was tearing and repairing, along with Killmonger's as well. As Killmonger began to denounce his reign, T'Challa countered that he just want Wakanda to be just like the people he hates by dividing and conquering a foreign land.

T'Challa screaming at Erik Killmonger
When Killmonger tried to rebuttal, T'Challa responded that he will become just like his oppressors and will destroy the world, Wakanda included. As Killmonger cried out that the world took everything away from him, T'Challa was threatened that he will be even by tracking anyone who will ever think about being loyal to him and kill them just like Zuri. Knowing that he will never stop murdering the one he loved, T'Challa screamed at Killmonger and began to charge at him, continuing to fight each other.

Black Panther furiously fights Erik Killmonger
As the fight started to become more frantic, T'Challa fought against Killmonger, gaining the upper hand by throwing him off the railroad and ended hurting him, while trying to stay at bay. Once Killmonger grabbed a short spear, T'Challa avoided his strikes once the duel continued. T'Challa was pushed back, trying to switch the blade toward him, only to move over to his side. When the train moved along, T'Challa punched the knife away and in the air, T'Challa rolled over, catching the spear, and fatally stabbed Killmonger in the heart. 

T'Challa proposes on saving Erik Killmonger
Knowing the fight was over, T'Challa listened to Killmonger's memories about his father, and how he told him that Wakanda was the most beautiful place in the world. After this, T'Challa helped Killmonger go on top of the mine reached the cliff to watch the sunset. While there, T'Challa offered to heal Killmonger, but Killmonger refused, saying that he would rather die, pulling the spear out of his body, bleeding to death.

Giving the World Resources
T'Challa returns to the Tribal Council
Periodically after reclaiming Wakanda, T'Challa buried Erik Killmonger, as the rest of the Dora Milaje and the Border Tribe settled down after their battle was over, stopping the weapons that were meant to be send out into the world. T'Challa reassigned himself as the King of Wakanda, going over to reclaim his throne inside the Tribal Council.

T'Challa and Nakia meet each other in the city
As Wakanda was finally prospering, T'Challa went over to the streets of the Golden City to meet up with Nakia at a stairwell, deciding to talk about their recent actions. After greeting the locals that were walking up the stairs, T'Challa proceeded to thank Nakia for her actions by saving him and his family. Nakia then responded that the people's nation was her duty to fight for what she loved before stumbling her words toward T'Challa.

T'Challa tells Nakia to stay with him
Once she continued on, T'Challa interrupted Nakia's sentence by kissing her and after stopping he tries to rationalize by almost dying. After making a remark, T'Challa was then kissed by Nakia and once it was done, he asked Nakia to stay, knowing a way to still fulfill her calling, pleading for her stay in the city. Deciding to stay there, T'Challa was tenderly kissed by Nakia again, settling their relationship.

T'Challa tells Shuri about the sold-out buildings
Later on, T'Challa and Shuri went over to Oakland in California and looked at the old apartment building of his uncle. Shuri would remark on what T'Challa said by going to California for the first time, she thought of Coachella or Disneyland. Asked why by Shuri they were there in the first place, T'Challa told Shuri where their father killed N'Jobu, informing her that it will not be tearing down, which to her relief while reading the sign.

T'Challa breaks the news of Shuri's property
Breaking the news to her, T'Challa told Shuri that he bought the old apartment building and a couple of other landmarks, saying that it will be Wakanda's first Wakandan International Outreach Centre. T'Challa also announced the news that Shuri will be ahead of the science and information exchange, having her in disbelief. Activating a new Royal Talon Fighter up from the sky as a gift, T'Challa made it nontransparent in the basketball for Shuri to ride.

T'Challa notices a child in front of him
As the children noticed the ship, gawking at the sight of it and planned to sell the parts of it, until Shuri told the kids that it was hers and when asked of where she came from, she told them that she was from Wakanda, much to their confusion. As T'Challa leaned over the fence, he was asked by one boy with braids on his hair if the ship on the court was his or not and later realizing that he is likely the owner of the jet, asked who he was, smiling at him.

Joining the United Nations
T'Challa arriving in Vienna International Centre
Heading over to United Nations, T'Challa walked into over to the Vienna International Centre with Okoye Nakia, and Ayo beside him as he entered. When Everett Ross arrived to meet up, T'Challa was greeted by him before being asked for a private conversation, to which T'Challa asked to give them space. T'Challa listened to Ross' recommendation that he should not reveal their wealth and power to the United Nations, fearing the response could be dangerous.

T'Challa decides to go on with his speech
T'Challa, however, insisted to Ross that he would no longer rule out of fear like his father had done, believing they should lead by example. While Ross heard this, T'Challa's decision was accepted and went off with his people to let him make his speech. Before leaving, however, T'Challa was wished good luck in Xhosa, however, he mispronounced some words which caused Okoye and Ayo to laugh alongside Nakia while Ross insisted that he practiced his phrase, T'Challa thanked him in Xhosa.

T'Challa giving a speech to the United Nations
Entering the room with photographers and cameramen on him, T'Challa then gave his speech in which he established full relations between Wakanda and the rest of the world, promising to share their vibranium and technology. Continuing his speech, T'Challa spoke about letting Wakanda to no longer watch from the shadows and the people will work to be an example of how Human beings on Earth should treat each other, with no illusions of division threaten our very existence.

T'Challa finalizes his speech to the public
Focusing on every listener, T'Challa told the public that a connection between other countries is now more in need than ever.

Saving the Winter Soldier
T'Challa accepts on helping Bucky Barnes
T'Challa then returned home to Wakanda, bringing with him Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes. Offering the latter asylum, he informed the pair that the best chance of having the Winter Soldier Programming removed was for Barnes to return to cryo-sleep stasis, which Barnes agreed to do.

T'Challa promises to protect Bucky Barnes
After Shuri explained how she intended to remove the HYDRA programming, Barnes willingly let himself freeze in a cryo-chamber until the Wakandan Design Group scientists could find a way to cure him of HYDRA's brainwashing. Rogers warned T'Challa that forces of opposition would come and declare war on Wakanda for allowing Barnes to take refuge, to which T'Challa replied that they could try as the two overlooked the landscape of the kingdom's mountains.

Infinity War
Recruiting Bucky Barnes
T'Challa recruiting Bucky Barnes to fight
Following the attacks by Black Order in New York City and Scotland, the remaining Avengers on Earth traveled to Wakanda and appealed to T'Challa for help to extract the Mind Stone from Vision's head before Thanos' expected invasion of Earth.

T'Challa acknowledges the incoming battle
Agreeing to help, T'Challa ordered his followers to equip Bucky Barnes with a new prosthetic arm. Alongside with Barnes, Okoye told T'Challa that the Royal Guard and the Dora Milaje have been alerted, including the Border Tribe and the Jabari Tribe as well. T'Challa told Okoye that despite Barnes being tired of war, he has rested long enough. T'Challa visited Barnes and gave him a new prosthetic arm. Noticing the arm, Barnes asked him where the fight is, and T'Challa responded that it was on its way.

Preparation for Battle
T'Challa seeing the Avengers' arrival
Shortly after T'Challa recruited Bucky Barnes, he waited for the Avengers' arrival in their Quinjet. Walking toward the helipad, T'Challa was asked by Okoye that while opening to the rest the world she did not expect a war incoming, to which he responded with a question with what she had in mind, talking about the Olympics and Starbucks.

T'Challa greeting Steve Rogers in Wakanda
Once the Avengers arrived in Wakanda, T'Challa was reunited with Steve Rogers, being thanked for his help securing Vision. T'Challa was also introduced to Bruce Banner, who was tricked by James Rhodes to bow to him, telling him that his people do not do that sort of thing. Walking over toward the city, T'Challa questions how big of an assault can his army expect, Banner responded that it is going to be quite of a big assault, tells the Avengers that they will have the Wakandan Royal Guard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and Barnes by their side.

T'Challa orders his army in preparation
As he led the Avengers into the Citadel, T'Challa tasked Shuri with extracting the Mind Stone from Vision's forehead. Once Shuri notices there are more than two trillion neurons here, T'Challa informed by her that it will take time to disassemble each part. Alerted by Okoye's Kimoyo bead, T'Challa rallied the Wakandans in order to fight the members of the Black Order, knowing that they will come to Wakanda for the Stone.

Battle of Wakanda
T'Challa goes over to the Wakandan battlefield
Onto the Wakandan battlefield, T'Challa rode along the carriers that are hovering over the ground with Wakandan soldiers and Natasha Romanoff, Rogers, and Barnes on board; while War Machine and Falcon kept the pace overhead, and Banner wears the Hulkbuster armor. As the carrier pilots swerve to stop and the Dora Milaje had joined the ranks, T'Challa dropped off from his ride and met M'Baku to thank him for his cooperation.

Black Panther leading the forces of Wakanda
Walking toward the edge of the barrier, T'Challa, Rogers, and Romanoff stood between where Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian are in front of them. As Midnight drawing her sword, T'Challa and his allies were threatened by her, responding to her that Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood on his hands, only for her to send multiple Outriders out from their Outrider Dropship. T'Challa went back to lead the Wakandans in the war cry, telling them to hold fast as the Outriders bound toward the barrier as Midnight signaled to attack.

Black Panther running towards the battlefield
Once the enemies quickly appeared, T'Challa signaled to shoot them in mass, though most of them could not penetrate Wakanda's protective force field. To prevent them from flanking their position and reaching Vision, T'Challa ordered the shield wall lowered to funnel the enemies towards them and began to attack them. As the Outriders are coming toward them, T'Challa and Rogers rapidly ran ahead due to their enhancements and leaped into battle.

Black Panther contacts Shuri during battle
Over his intercom, T'Challa told Shuri on how much time she had left for her to fix Vision, responding that she barely begun, asking her to pick up the pace. As the battle continued on, a large beam of light lands in the middle of the field, revealing Thor, Groot and Rocket Raccoon, T'Challa paused in shock and surprise. Upon witnessing Obsidian killing several Wakandans, T'Challa leaped onto him and used all his collected kinetic energy to punch him.

Black Panther tells his army to fall back
When the disturbance reached the edge of the trees, a vast number of Threshers began to shred everything in their path, prompting T'Challa to command his army to fall back from them. Though many lives were lost, T'Challa and his Wakandan army fought valiantly and killed many of Thanos' forces with Thor having to arrive alongside to help them turn the tide of the battle.

Thanos' Victory
Black Panther witnesses the arrival of Thanos
As T'Challa and the remaining Avengers had gathered near a forest, they discovered a disturbance coming towards them. As the group became silent enough, Thanos teleported himself to Earth and arrived in Wakanda to personally retrieve the Mind Stone. Once Thanos stood and observe, Captain America ordered the group to stay sharp and attack him. 

Black Panther is taken down by Thanos
As Thanos' dominion over the fabrics of reality given to him by the nearly completed Infinity Gauntlet, T'Challa attempted to attack him with the use of his kinetic energy pulse to implode onto his opponent. However, with little effect, the Mad Titan easily grabbed T'Challa by the shoulder with his Infinity Gauntlet hand and punched him with so much force that all the energies in his Panther Habit were expelled, knocking him out instantly.

T'Challa starting to fade away into dust
Although they bought enough time for Wanda Maximoff to destroy the Mind Stone, Thanos used the Time Stone to undo her actions and retrieved the stone from Vision, destroying him. With a snap of his fingers, Thanos' plan came to fruition as half of all sentient life across the whole universe began to disintegrate into dust. T'Challa held out his hand to bring Okoye up, only for him to disintegrate in front of her horrified eyes.

Battle of Earth
Black Panther rejoins the fight against Thanos
Five years later, the remnants of the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy launched the Time Heist, which ultimately allowed for the Blip, with T'Challa as one of the many victims brought back to life. While a 2014 version of Thanos attacked the New Avengers Facility, the Masters of the Mystic Arts led by Doctor Strange and Wong recruited all their restored allies.

Black Panther leads his people into battle
After Thanos had summoned his massive army from the Sanctuary II, T'Challa emerged from a Sling Ring portal, along with Shuri and Okoye. He shared a glance with Captain America to show he was back. When all their allies had emerged from portals, Captain America ordered them to attack and T'Challa joined the leading charge on the aliens. When the Nano Gauntlet was brought to the surface, Captain America ordered it to be brought to the Quantum Tunnel within Luis' van so the Stones within could be returned to their rightful places in time. 

Black Panther protects the Nano Gauntlet
When the Outriders were closing in on Hawkeye, T'Challa drove them away with his kinetic energy pulse. He then acknowledged Hawkeye, calling him by his first name "Clint", something he learned during the Clash of the Avengers and told him to give him the Gauntlet. T'Challa then tried to reach the van but was knocked down by Thanos' Double-Edged Sword. The warlord then charged at T'Challa only to be saved by Wanda Maximoff, who engaged the Titan in combat. T'Challa then made another attempt to secure the Gauntlet only to be ensnared by Ebony Maw's telekinesis, negating his suit's ability to channel kinetic energy. As Maw nearly claimed the Gauntlet, T'Challa threw it to the passing Spider-Man. 

T'Challa present at Tony Stark's funeral
As the fight continued, Captain Marvel came within range of the van only for Thanos to destroy it and claim the Gauntlet. Before he could activate the Infinity Stones, however, Iron Man engaged him one last time, assimilating the Stones into his own armor and using their power to end the battle, though at the cost of his own life. After the battle, T'Challa resumed his duties as King of Wakanda, overseeing his people's celebration at their loved ones' return, along with Shuri and their mother, Ramonda. Later, he, Shuri, and Okoye were among those present at Tony Stark's funeral to honor his sacrifice.

Personality
T'Challa is polite, respectful, and very caring for the people he is around and who he considers his friends. He is shown to have high respect towards other people, especially towards his father, T'Chaka. He honors the tradition and principles of Wakanda and is willing to take action whenever it is necessary. When his father died, he was willing and ready to take his rightful place as king of Wakanda. While he does not seem to favor fights, he was very quick to try and avenge his father's death. An honorable fighter, T'Challa respects his opponents and is willing to spare his enemies' lives. That being said, he is not opposed to killing his opponents in a fight and does not always try to avoid lethal measures of disabling them. Though he mortally injured Erik Killmonger, he still offered him the chance to heal his wounds and even granted his wish to see Wakanda's sunset before dying. When M'Baku challenged T'Challa for the throne, T'Challa focused on forcing M'Baku to yield rather than trying to kill him.

Despite shown to be too action-oriented and had too much of a shoot-first-ask-questions-later attitude early in his introductions, he is, however, not incapable to see reason and was level-headed enough to know when to keep his emotions in check, shown when he finally had the chance to avenge his father, he ultimately chose not to, knowing that doing so would make him fall as low as Zemo, and would go against what the Black Panther stands for. As he stood by Zemo, the latter explained to him about how he had also lost his loved ones too, and that he and T'Challa were not so different, as they both are in pursuit of revenge. It was at this moment that T'Challa realized that revenge has completely consumed Zemo, and he realized that this is not what his father would have wanted for him, he even offered to heal Erik Killmonger despite wanting to kill him initially due to the multiple atrocities he committed, and for killing Zuri who was a friend and a mentor to him. In the end, he agreed to help Captain America and Winter Soldier by granting them asylum in Wakanda, despite their status being international criminals now, as he was able to empathize with the pain both went through. He also displays a strong resolve, as when Captain America warned him the world might declare war on his country for housing Winter Soldier, he confidently stated to let them come.

According to his father, T'Challa tends to disapprove of diplomacy but was nevertheless supportive of the Sokovia Accords, showing that he is more a warrior at heart than a politician.

Since ascending to the throne as King of Wakanda, he is constantly torn between honoring the traditions of Wakanda and helping the wider world. T'Challa personally questions Wakanda's isolationism, yet unable to find any solid reasons to take a stand on the issue other than traditions. While he agrees that Wakanda, as the most advanced country in the world, can and should do more to help the world, he is unwilling to revise the country's isolationist policies.

It isn't until T'Challa has been dethroned by his corrupted and very destructive cousin, learning about his father's mistakes and the country is on the brink of declaring war against the rest of the world, that he realizes that Wakanda's isolationism had caused, and will eventually cause, more harm than good to the nation's interests, and that of the world's at large. His epiphany on the matter becomes so firm that he berates his father's and his predecessors' insistence on isolationism in the spirit realm, and vows to make Wakanda truly a part of the world.

To that end, T'Challa would develop a strong moral compass, devoting himself to doing what's best for the people around him, even beyond his status as King. T'Challa initiated a variety of programs dedicated to providing aid to the needy in foreign countries, and promote exchanges in a variety of fields, as early steps to break Wakanda's isolation in a very cautious manner, as it is impossible to fully share Wakanda's wealth, technological advancements, and vibranium resources, without causing worldwide chaos.

T'Challa is not a very talkative person, as he usually stays silent during conversations and often talks in short sentences. Even though T'Challa almost always shows a mostly serious demeanor, he is actually quite humorous and sarcastic around his family and friends. He jokes and playfully interacts with Shuri, Nakia, and Okoye. He also had a good friendship with W'Kabi and Zuri until the former lost faith in him for his failure to capture Klaue.

In addition to his good-hearted nature, T'Challa can also be very helpful to his allies. After realizing that Helmut Zemo was the true killer of his father and not Bucky Barnes, T'Challa offered the latter shelter in his homeland of Wakanda and helped cure him of his mental programming by HYDRA. He also assisted Steve Rogers and his faction of the Avengers in fighting against the army of Thanos.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Heart-shaped Herb Enhancement: After having consumed the Heart-shaped Herb, T'Challa's physical attributes have been significantly enhanced to levels comparable to a super soldier. The herb grants him enhanced strength, durability, speed, agility, stamina, reflexes and healing. Unlike the Super Soldier Serum, the effects can be removed by drinking a serum that negates the powers of the herbs for ritualistic combat for a fair fight to become King of Wakanda.
Enhanced Strength:     T'Challa shifting a car with one hand   After having consumed the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa's strength is tremendously enhanced beyond the peak of human potential, moving into the early levels of superhuman condition. His enhanced strength allows him to physically overpower humans as well as alien subservients. He can lift and support great amounts of weight, as seen during the Arrest of Ulysses Klaue when he shifted the weight of a 2.14-ton car with one hand. His strength also allows him to send opponents flying through the air from his strikes during combat; while rescuing Nakia from traffickers in the Sambisa Forest, T'Challa kicked one of the criminals hard enough to send them flying several meters and into a car while seriously denting its door, and threw a car door hard enough to send a trafficker rotate mid-air. While T'Challa's strength is rivalled by enhanced beings like Captain America, the Winter Soldier and Erik Killmonger, he was able to overpower the Winter Soldier despite the latter's own strength and fighting ability, able to send him flying through the air with his attacks, and was strong enough to easily push back his bionic arm, even Rogers failed to do so. He was also able to battle Captain America on equal grounds, even managed to knock back the super soldier. Furthermore, T'Challa was able to swiftly tackle down a charging rhino and throw a vibranium spear with enough force to take down a Wakandan plane. During the Battle of Wakanda, against Thanos' army, T'Challa was able to overpower many Outriders. Even without the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa is in excellent physical condition from his years of training, which allowed him to stagger M'Baku and even knock him down during their duel.
Enhanced Durability: T'Challa's bones and muscles are denser and is much more harder than a normal human being, which makes him incredibly durable. Even when not wearing his Panther Habit, he can survive extreme blunt force trauma such as being hit with the Winter Soldier's bionic arm with no visible injuries, and surviving the explosion at the Vienna International Centre despite being right next to the blast's epicenter with only minor injuries. During the Avengers Civil War, T'Challa was able to resist several of Black Widow's Taser Disks whereas a normal human would be knocked out by just one. During his pursuit on Ulysses Klaue, T'Challa was blasted down onto a casino table and exited the building unharmed.
Enhanced Speed: T'Challa can run and move at speeds beyond the peak of human potential, moving and running into the early levels of superhuman condition. Like his father, T'Chaka, he can run as fast as a zebra and outrun a white rhinoceros. He was able to catch up to and outrun speeding vehicles and outpace the running pace of Captain America and Winter Soldier respectively, eventually overtaking the Winter Soldier's motorcycle by using the vehicle Captain America hijacked as a springboard. T'Challa has proven to be slightly faster than Captain America, as shown during the Battle of Wakanda, when he ran at almost superior speeds with him when rushing towards the Outriders. During the Rescue of Nakia, T'Challa was fast enough to attack the traffickers even before they were able to aim their weapons on him. During the escape of Klaue, T'Challa was able to quickly catch up to the accelerating van but then he was blasted by a grande launcher fire by Killmonger. Upon seeing Killmonger was about to kill Shuri, T'Challa was able to run from one side of the battle field to another with extreme speed in a matter of seconds, successfully saving Shuri by tackling him and causing both of them to fall into the Great Mound. He also fast enough to stab Killmonger in the heart with a Vibranium Zulu Short-Spear before the former's nanite suit could reform. In combat, he was fast enough to go toe-to-toe with the fellow super soldiers like Captain America, the Winter Soldier and Erik Killmonger. During Battle of Earth, T'Challa was able to easily outrun all of the Outriders while holding the Nano Gauntlet to prevent them from getting it.
Enhanced Agility:     T'Challa acrobatically fights Captain America   T'Challa's agility is outstanding. He can coordinate his body with perfect balance, equilibrium, flexibility, and dexterity and leap or lunge great distances with extreme accuracy. He was able to lunge forward several feet when attempting to shield his father from the explosion in at the Vienna International Centre, and being able to reach the second floor of the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre Building faster than Barnes could walk up a set of stairs. His enhanced agility also allows him to effortlessly outrun and vault over moving vehicles. He was able to lunge forward several feet by vaulting over a moving vehicle and successfully pounce onto the back of the car which Rogers stole, and later lunge forward several feet by jumping from Rogers' car in an attempt to knock Winter Soldier off his motorcycle, as well as lunging forward several feet by vaulting over a vehicle moving in the opposite direction and successfully pouncing onto the back of Falcon. T'Challa was able to perform aerial wheel kicks while fighting Captain America, leap forward several feet to dodge an explosion and a large burning fire truck being thrown towards him, jump forward several feet trying to get a hold of the Quinjet. During the Rescue of Nakia, T'Challa was able to roll himself forward mid-air for several feet and land on a traffickers's truck with ease. During Manhunt for Ulysses Klaue, he was able to leap over to the top of the balcony with a single bounce, backflip several feet upwards and land onto a moving car controlled by Shuri with ease, and easily lunge and latch from one car to another while they were traveling at high speeds and taking out Klaue's henchmen. After being propelled into the air by a kinetic pulse, T'Challa was able to contort his body mid-air and land on the roof of a vehicle while it was traveling at high speed without any difficulty. When the car was blown away by Klaue's sonic cannon, T'Challa was able to jump and leap from that car to a height of several stories in a single bound, landing onto the ceiling wall of a neon sign and then successfully leaping onto the side the van wit ease. T'Challa was also able to jump over a height of several feet of the Border Tribe's defense shields. During the Battle of Wakanda, T'Challa was able to leap forward several feet alongside with Captain America to attack the Outriders, leap forward several feet to attack Cull Obsidian and successfully knock him down, and later Thanos, though he was able to catch him mid-air and knock T'Challa to the ground. During the Battle of Earth, he was able to leap several feet upward in attempt to secure the Nao Gauntlet but only to be ensnared by Ebony Maw's telekinesis.
Enhanced Stamina: T'Challa's musculature produces fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human and his body eliminates the excessive build-up of fatigue-producing chemicals in his muscles. He was able to intensely pursue the Winter Soldier on foot without any signs of fatigue, and fight against fellow super soldiers like Captain America, the Winter Soldier, and Erik Killmonger for an extended period of time without tiring, ultimately defeating the latter. During all those battles T'Challa have fought include Avengers Civil War, Battle of Mount Bashenga, Battle of Wakanda and Battle of Earth, he has shown without any noticeable sign of fatigue.
Enhanced Reflexes:     Black Panther catching Hawkeye's arrows   The heart-shaped herb enhanced T'Challa's reflexes, allowing him to effectively process the world at an accelerated rate. His reflexes were sharp and fast enough to dodge an explosion and a large burning fire truck being thrown towards him, evade a kick from enlarged Ant-Man, dodge many Hawkeye's arrows and even manage to catch them out of the air with his bare hands, stop Zemo from committing suicide using a gun at point-blank range, dodge gunfire from point-blank range by the traffickers, evade a blast from Ulysses Klaue's prosthetic arm, cover a grenade using his body the moment he saw it, catch a spear in mid-air, easily dodge an aircraft which was crashing towards him, dodge an attack by a charging rhino with ease, and even swiftly dodge a train moving towards him at high speed. His reflexes also allow him to respond quickly to fast-paced combat, as he was able to quickly dodge or block the attacks from the likes of Captain America, the Winter Soldier, Hawkeye and Erik Killmonger.
Regenerative Healing Factor: T'Challa's fast healing capabilities allows for him to have a conditioned metabolism that enables an extraordinarily efficient recovery. After being stripped away the powers of the herb, T'Challa suffered blunt force, cuts, and bruises due to fighting for the Black Panther monarchy. Afterward, having being restored the powers of the herb, T'Challa recovered from many of the damages he endured and was healed in a matter of hours. This even enables him to fully recover from being on the brink of death in mere hours.
