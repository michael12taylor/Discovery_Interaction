Clinton Francis "Clint" Barton, also known as Hawkeye, is an extremely skilled marksman, a former special agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and one of the founding members of the Avengers. Known for his use of the bow and arrow as his primary weapon, Barton had become one of the best agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., responsible for the recruitment of Black Widow, whom he developed a strong friendship with. Assigned by Nick Fury into watching over the Tesseract, he was brainwashed by Loki and used as his pawn for all his evil schemes. However, following their Attack on the Helicarrier, he was freed from Loki's mental controls by Black Widow and joined the Avengers to fight against Loki's Chitauri army in the Battle of New York, ending Loki's Invasion, before Hawkeye had returned to his work as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

Hawkeye continued to work with S.H.I.E.L.D. until its collapse following the HYDRA Uprising, he and the Avengers worked to bring down the remnants of HYDRA, eventually capturing Wolfgang von Strucker and ending the organization's threat to the world. However, Hawkeye was pulled back into their fight as Tony Stark had inadvertently used HYDRA as well as some Chitauri technology to create Ultron. As Ultron tried to destroy their world, he allied himself with Pietro and Wanda Maximoff and Barton focused much of his efforts in convincing them to change sides while keeping all the Avengers safe by bringing them into his family home. During the final Battle of Sokovia, Hawkeye's life was saved by Quicksilver's sacrifice, resulting in Barton retiring from the Avengers to return to his family.

Despite living happily within retirement for a brief time, Barton was recruited by Captain America to help him during his fight against these newly produced Sokovia Accords, which forced Rogers to protect his friend Bucky Barnes from being arrested for a crime he did not commit. Feeling that he owed a debt to Rogers and Maximoff, Hawkeye had joined in the Clash of the Avengers, fighting against Iron Man who was in support of the Accords. Despite putting up a good fight, Hawkeye and most of their team were eventually defeated and imprisoned at the Raft under the order from Thaddeus Ross, only to be freed by Rogers. Barton returned back to retirement and, after striking his deal with Ross, was then placed under his house arrest.

In the wake of the Snap, Barton then went onto a grief-fuelled rampage against criminals for five years as a vigilante named Rōnin. Having been found by Black Widow, Barton was then convinced to return to the Avengers to attempt to reverse the Snap. Hawkeye joined the team in enacting the Time Heist in order to obtain the Infinity Stones, during which he witnessed Romanoff sacrifice her life so Hawkeye could reclaim the Soul Stone. However, as the Avengers had succeeded in their goal, they were ambushed by Thanos, with Hawkeye being ordered to ensure Thanos could not get the Nano Gauntlet. Eventually, Thanos and his entire army were defeated, as Tony Stark had sacrificed his life, allowing Barton to then return home with his beloved family, while he still mourned Romanoff's death.

Biography
Early Life
Marrying Laura
Clint Barton was born in Iowa to Edith Barton. Barton had never finished his high school, but he developed a talent for marksmanship, mainly with a bow and arrow, and was also trained in swordsmanship by Jack Duquesne. Later in his life, Barton met Laura, whom he eventually married and started a family with.

Joining S.H.I.E.L.D.
Recruited by Nick Fury
Barton was hand-picked by Nick Fury for his skills, becoming one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most skilled agents. Barton had only told Fury of his relationship with Laura, so Fury excluded her from Barton's S.H.I.E.L.D. files in order to protect them, as well as setting up a farmhouse for the couple in Missouri. Barton and Laura had two children, Cooper and Lila, who were raised in secrecy at the farmhouse. During one of his missions for S.H.I.E.L.D., Barton had been targeted for assassination by Marcus Scarlotti, who came closer than anyone else to killing Barton, although he had still failed.

Meeting the Black Widow
Clint Barton's personal S.H.I.E.L.D. records
During Hawkeye's time as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., an assassin who was known as the Black Widow appeared on the organization's radar as she had become a potential threat to global security. Hawkeye was assigned to Russia, where he would carry out the assassination of Black Widow. However, once Hawkeye had tracked down Black Widow and confronted her, he saw her true potential and instead of killing her, recruited her into S.H.I.E.L.D.. Hawkeye would discover Black Widow's true name, Natasha Romanoff, and the two would work closely.

Hawkeye and Black Widow during a mission
Romanoff was then seen as Barton's counterpart and the relationship between the two developed into a lasting partnership, as they became best friends while continuing to work together as S.H.I.E.L.D.'s top agents. Together, they would arrange their missions in Abidjan and elsewhere. The pair grew so close that Romanoff became the only other person Barton told about his family. She became a good friend to them, even adopting an aunt-like relationship with Barton and Laura's two children. In return, Romanoff also told Barton about her past life with the Red Room and as an assassin.

Budapest Operation
One of their most crucial missions was in Budapest, where the two had been assigned to kill Dreykov, the leader of the Red Room, and Natasha Romanoff's former mentor. After Barton and Romanoff rigged his office with bombs, Dreykov's daughter was used to lure the Red Room leader, and on Romanoff's signal, Barton exploded the building, seemingly killing the two. Shortly after this, Barton and Romanoff engaged in a firefight with the Hungarian Special Forces, and spent the next ten days hiding in the city, two of which were spent inside the ceiling of a subway station, where they would bond and play games.

New Mexico Mission
Hawkeye running outside to stop the intruder
Barton was instructed by Nick Fury to go down into New Mexico and investigate an 0-8-4 that had been discovered. Along the way, Barton found a gas station which was almost robbed until a suited man had intervened. Barton then arrived onto the site where he was put under the leadership of Phil Coulson. Soon after his deployment at the site, an intruder had managed to successfully break into the compound and had fought his way towards their 0-8-4 that they were currently investigating.

Hawkeye preparing to shoot down at Thor
Barton was ordered to be their eyes up high and to use a gun, but Barton instead collected his compound bow. Barton then claimed a vantage point suspended from a crane and watched from above as the intruder continued. Hawkeye then requested if he should fire, but Coulson wanted to see what the intruder would do, as Hawkeye then commented that he was starting to root for him. Finally, the intruder got to the 0-8-4 and attempted to steal it, as Hawkeye watched on.

Hawkeye being ordered to stand down
When the intruder failed to steal the 0-8-4 and screamed in complete frustration, Coulson had him arrested and ordered Hawkeye to stand down. Hawkeye then noticed a woman fleeing, as he decided to let the intruder go, so they could track him. Hawkeye was later called in as the Destroyer attacked Puente Antiguo, witnessing Thor regain his powers and defeat it. With the Destroyer defeated, Barton helped to transport it to Headquarters and discussed his next missions.

Chitauri Invasion
Destruction of P.E.G.A.S.U.S.
Hawkeye observing the Tesseract's study
Barton was sent by Nick Fury to test the Helicarrier's security by breaking inside and accessing the Avengers Initiative database, only for him to be stopped by Black Widow. Barton and Fury later discussed their candidates, questioning their accountability. Following this, Barton was ordered to observe the Tesseract's study at the Main Facility of Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S., as he ensured Erik Selvig's history to ensure he was clean. When Fury came to view the facility himself, Barton discussed Black Widow's undercover work, before Fury left for the Arctic, leaving Barton with Selvig.

Barton briefs Nick Fury about the Tesseract
Sometime later, the Tesseract began acting strangely so Fury and Maria Hill were called in to inspect the situation during the evacuations of the facility, while Barton stayed up on a platform in the main facility, ensuring that the scientists were not tampering with the Tesseract in anyway, as he believed he could observe everything better from higher up. Fury first demanded a report about the Tesseract's energy levels from Selvig, questioning what could be causing the unusual activity, before he spoke to Barton about his views on the situation, asking for a briefing on the team.

Barton and Nick Fury witness Loki's arrival
Barton confirmed that Selvig and his team were not a threat to them, having completed his background checks. When Fury asked if he believed that the Tesseract had been tampered with, Barton responded that if there was, it was not at this end of the Tesseract; which confused Fury, as he asked Barton to explain his theory. Barton then explained that he viewed the Tesseract as a doorway from space which could be opened from both sides, something Selvig and the other scientist had been unable to figure out, only for their conversation to be cut short, as the Tesseract began emitting high levels of energy right beside them.

Barton being put under mind control by Loki
Suddenly, the Tesseract opened a portal that brought Loki to Earth, who immediately attacked the base, killing several agents. Barton was just able to save Fury's life from a blast of energy from Loki's Scepter. Loki then used his Scepter to alter and control the minds of Barton, Selvig, and a handful of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Under Loki's influence, Barton believed that he willingly worked for Loki and recommended that they evacuate the facility as the Tesseract was about to overload. Loki ordered Barton to shoot Fury before they departed.

Barton escapes alongside Erik Selvig and Loki
Barton helped Loki steal the Tesseract and escape from the base towards S.H.I.E.L.D. Jeeps. However, Fury managed to survive due to wearing a Bulletproof Vest and warned Hill of his betrayal, leading to a brief shoot out. They managed to get into a jeep and were chased by Hill until she became trapped under rubble when the facility imploded. Fury managed to catch up with them and shot at them from a Helicopter, Loki shot the helicopter from the sky and Barton drove them away to safety.

Controlled by Loki
Barton locates his next target for their mission
Barton then acted as Loki's commander at his safe house, which Barton personally selected due to protective defenses. Barton commanded various other mind-controlled mercenaries and workers and helping collect the materials that Erik Selvig needed to utilize the Tesseract. Selvig asked Barton were he found all of the workers, to which he informed Selvig that S.H.I.E.L.D. a lot of enemies. Barton located a material that Selvig needed to complete his work. Loki came to be updated on their work, while Selvig complimented the Tesseract's incredible power, Barton noted that it had shown him their next target, which he would require a distraction and an eyeball.

Barton informing Loki about the Avengers
When Selvig mocked the choice of hide-out, Barton explained that it was the most secure base that they could acquire. Barton told Loki that Nick Fury would be putting a team together to stop their plans, although Barton insisted that the team was more likely a danger to themselves. Loki demanded to know everything about them, vowing to test them so he could rule the Earth. Loki questioned why Barton had failed to kill Fury, asking if it was because he admired him, but Barton argued he was disorientated and not at his best with a gun. Barton would go on to inform Loki all about the members of Fury's team, including the dangerousness of Hulk, Black Widow's past, and the power of Stark Tower.

Barton successfully steals the Iridium for Loki
Barton traveled to Stuttgart, Germany with Loki where he used his infiltration skills and knowledge of S.H.I.E.L.D. to help to steal a store of Iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract. While Loki attacked Heinrich Schafer and used a device to violently scan his eyeball, Barton silently shot several guards with his arrows before getting inside and using a hologram of Schafer's eyeball to gain access to the facility and successfully steal the iridium before escaping. Barton would then proceed to collect any other raw materials that would be needed for the portal with ease, while Loki allowed himself to be captured.

Attack on the Helicarrier
Hawkeye prepares to attack the Helicarrier
Loki allowed himself to be captured by the Avengers, and Barton led a small group of mercenaries in an attack on the Helicarrier, using a stolen Quinjet to covertly approach the Helicarrier. Barton destroyed an engine with an accurately placed explosive arrow and boarded the Helicarrier with a team of mercenaries with their task to destroy the Avengers by unleashing Hulk and freeing Loki so they could complete their plan to use the Tesseract to bring about the war on Earth.

Hawkeye attacks the Control Room
Using the chaos onboard the Helicarrier to his advantage, Barton made his way to the control room and while mercenaries distracted the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents with grenades and gunfire, Barton fired a Hacker arrow at the controls where he further crippled the ship's systems, turning off the remaining engines and causing the Helicarrier to fall from the sky. Before he could cause more damage with explosive arrows, he was shot at by Nick Fury and Maria Hill, forcing him to retreat and continue his way through the Helicarrier to find Loki.

Hawkeye furiously fights against Black Widow
As he continued to make his way through the Helicarrier, Barton was confronted by Black Widow; who snuck up behind him in an attempt to disarm him. The two old friends had a prolonged fight using Barton's bow and arrows, knives, and when the fight got dirtier – with teeth. Barton used all his top-level training to kill his former friend, including firing several arrows at her, although she was able to dodge them, as well as attempting to drive a knife into her neck while pulling her hair back.

Hawkeye is defeated by Black Widow
In the end, Barton was no match for Romanoff's speed and quick-thinking, and eventually, she got the upper hand, disarming him and slammed Barton's head onto a steel pipe. The blow weakened Loki's grip on Barton's mind and he recognized Romanoff, calling her by her first name before she knocked him out with a final strong punch to the head, breaking his connection to Loki and restoring his mind. He was then taken away by a S.H.I.E.L.D. team to be rehabilitated and cared for to ensure he was safe to continue working for S.H.I.E.L.D.

Regaining Control
Natasha Romanoff helps Barton's recovery
Barton was arrested and tied down until Loki's control was completely gone and he was no longer a threat. With Natasha Romanoff looking after Barton in the recovery room, he was able to break free of Loki's control, although the experience still had an impact on Barton, which he compared to being unmade. Romanoff refused to tell Barton how many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents he had killed when he asked, telling him that Loki and Loki alone was responsible for the killings and he must not blame himself.

Barton joining the Avengers to stop Loki
Satisfied that he was freed of his mind control, Barton resolved to help the Avengers fight back against Loki and stop his schemes of world domination. When Steve Rogers arrived to ask Romanoff if she could pilot a Quinjet, Barton told him he could. After Romanoff gave him the nod of approval, Rogers allowed Barton to join them on the mission, but first ensured that he had a uniform ready to go, Barton assured him they did and together they agreed to disobey the World Security Council and confront Loki head on as they had discovered he was hiding at Stark Tower.

Battle of New York
Hawkeye flies into the Battle of New York
With their determination to stop Loki, the Avengers took control of a S.H.I.E.L.D. Quinjet. Hawkeye flew Black Widow and Captain America to New York City just as the Tesseract portal opened. As Iron Man engaged the hordes of Chitauri that came pouring out of the portal, Hawkeye and Black Widow assisted by using the Quinjet's Gatling gun to shoot them out of the sky as they flew past. They found Loki battling Thor on top of Stark Tower when they attempted to assist, Loki shot down the Quinjet and the team crashed on the ground.

Hawkeye begins battling the Chitauri army
Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Captain America made their way to Stark Tower on foot and witnessed the Chitauri coming in from the portal and they all stayed on the ground to fight. Alongside Black Widow, Hawkeye fought the oncoming horde of Chitauri until the rest of the Avengers arrived. Hawkeye fired several trick arrows at the Chitauri while the civilians all clear out. While Hawkeye and Black Widow fight the Chitauri, she reminded him that the situation of being similar to their mission in Budapest, which Hawkeye told her that he remembered Budapest differently.

Avengers Assembled
Hawkeye fighting alongside Black Widow
While Hawkeye and Black Widow took on the Chitauri, Captain America joined them and was soon followed by Thor. While Hawkeye was reloading his quiver with used arrow rods from before, Thor told the Avengers that the power protecting the Tesseract is impenetrable so the team decided to fight the Chitauri in the meantime. When Thor discussed his desire to battle Loki, Hawkeye made it clear that he wished to kill him for revenge for the trauma he had suffered through, by telling him to get in line although Captain America told him to save that anger.

Hawkeye reloading some of his arrows
As Captain America told them the plan, they were interrupted when Bruce Banner arrived. Banner then transformed into Hulk to stop an incoming Leviathan, which Iron Man then blew up, so Hawkeye took cover behind a car to protect himself from the destruction. The Avengers all stood together in a circle as they overlooked the city overrun with Chitauri soldiers. Captain America then formulated a plan, ordering Hawkeye to take up a position on a building's rooftop, calling out enemy movements. Hawkeye asked for a lift from Iron Man who told him to clench up while jokingly calling him Legolas.

Eyes On Everything
Hawkeye with Thor on the battlefield
On the rooftop, Hawkeye was able to shoot many enemies out of the sky and used his skills in combat to kill any Chitauri who made it onto the roof, while advising the Avengers the best strategical maneuvers to defeat them. Hawkeye assisted Iron Man in fighting the Chitauri and to use his maneuvering skills to force them to accidentally crash into the side of buildings. Hawkeye also informed Iron Man that Thor was taking a squadron on sixth to which he joked that he was disappointed that he was not also invited.

Hawkeye destroying another Chitauri Chariot
Hawkeye fought off all Chitauri that climbed the building and flying on the chariots, managing to casually shoot one out of the sky without looking. Hawkeye dodged a blast and then fired an arrow at a soldier flying on a chariot at a far distance that crashed into a Leviathan. While Captain America fought a hostile, Hawkeye informed him that a civilians were being cornered in a bank ready to be executed, to which Captain America told him that he was on it and went to rescue them single-handedly from the alien attackers.

Last Stand
Hawkeye taking aim at the Chitauri army
When Hawkeye witnessed Black Widow being chased by Loki on a Chitauri Chariot, she called him for assistance. Delighted to get his shot at revenge against his own enslaver, Hawkeye loaded an explosive arrow out of his quiver and, taking his time to aim the perfect shot and fired it at Loki. However, Loki managed to catch the arrow and looked at it which made him smile smugly at the Avengers attempt to stop him.

Hawkeye shoots Loki out of the sky
The smile disappeared when the arrow exploded in Loki's face and caused him to fall from the sky and crash land on Stark Tower, where he was promptly attacked by Hulk who beat the god into submission. As the battle became more intense, The Avengers found themselves starting to become overpowered by Loki's forces. As Hawkeye continued to fight the Chitauri, he found that he has almost exhausted his supply of arrows. Eventually, Hawkeye ran out of arrows and began to fight the Chitauri with his bow. He then saw an incoming horde of Chitauri crafts heading in his direction.

Hawkeye jumps from the top of a skyscraper
He took his last arrow that was in a dead Chitauri, put it in his quiver, and turned it into a grapple. As the building was destroyed by the Chitauri, Hawkeye jumped off and shot the arrow while falling, and swung into a window to safety. Eventually, with the combined effort of Black Widow, Erik Selvig, and Iron Man, the portal was closed and the Chitauri army was killed. After the battle, the Avengers went to Stark Tower to capture Loki. As Loki turned around, he saw the Avengers stand before him with Hawkeye taking aim at him.

Invasion Aftermath
Hawkeye and Black Widow share a drink
Iron Man then told them to stop with the posing and to get Loki up, as HYDRA agents who were infiltrating S.H.I.E.L.D. arrived to help take in Loki, the Tesseract and the Scepter. Hawkeye went to the bar and poured him and Black Widow a drink as they told Jasper Sitwell to be careful with the Scepter, stating that it could erase their minds, and not in the fun way, calling back to his recent experience influenced by Loki.

The Avengers have lunch together
Hawkeye and Black Widow then relaxed together in Stark Tower as the STRIKE team left with the Scepter, as well as helping Thor, Iron Man and Hulk escort Loki and the Tesseract out of the tower. Later, the team decided to get some lunch together, so they took a breather at the Shawarma Palace, under Stark's recommendation. During their meal, they were interrupted by War Machine, who arrived too late to help in the battle.

Barton and Natasha Romanoff mock Loki
The next day the team, along with Selvig, gathered together at Central Park to send Loki back to Asgard with Thor and the Tesseract, where he would be punished for his crimes. While Loki was in chains, Romanoff whispered something in Barton's ear about Loki's punishment, which caused Barton to grin. The team then went their separate ways, Barton leaving with Romanoff to go back home to his family.

Barton and the Avengers go separate ways
Along with Romanoff, Barton continued working for S.H.I.E.L.D., with Steve Rogers joining and working with Romanoff. In 2014, S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed, causing Barton to no longer be working for them and he did not join the new S.H.I.E.L.D. that was created from the aftermath. Instead, Barton stuck with the Avengers as they developed themselves into their own independent team, operating out of the remodeled Stark Tower, with Tony Stark's financing them and giving them new equipment.

War on HYDRA
Attack on the HYDRA Base
Hawkeye during a battle against HYDRA
With the rising threat of HYDRA, the Avengers were assembled once more, with the financial backing of Tony Stark they went out to target the cell of Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, who they learned was now in possession of Loki's Scepter. Despite having briefly felt insecure about his place in the team, a mission in Sudan where Hawkeye had defeated Jensen had raised his confidence back up. The team then reassembled for an assault against Baron Strucker's main HYDRA Base in Sokovia.

Hawkeye shoots arrows at an HYDRA bunker
As the team charged inside Baron Strucker's base, Hawkeye rode in the back of a Jeep being driven by Black Widow, firing his arrows as they went while Iron Man and Thor flew alongside then and Captain America commanded the mission while riding his own weaponized motorcycle. When the jeep was crashed, Hawkeye continued to fight, keeping himself at a safe distance, using explosive arrows to destroy many HYDRA bunkers and tanks which Strucker sent after them.

Hawkeye realizes something is going wrong
As Hawkeye destroyed a HYDRA bunker with an explosive arrow and assisted Black Widow in her fight against Strucker's soldiers, he also stated that they had lost the element of surprise for the mission. As he silently sneaked through the battlefield, Hawkeye took up position behind a tree and attempted to destroy another HYDRA bunker with an explosive arrow, but the arrow was strangely intercepted by a fast moving opponent, much to Hawkeye's surprise and confusion.

Hawkeye attempted to reload and fire again at the bunker, but before he could release the arrow, his attacker then returned and in the blink of an eye had managed to throw Hawkeye through the air as he then landed awkwardly in all the snow. As Hawkeye had recovered from the ambush, his attacker revealed himself to be Pietro Maximoff, who taunted Hawkeye for failing to see the attack coming before dashing off into the distance, while holding Hawkeye's arrow in his hand.

Annoyed as he had watched his attacker vanish into the distance to attack all of the other Avengers, Hawkeye had then launched up and aimed his bow, but before he could fire, he failed to notice the bunker which he had failed to destroy, was currently taking aim and he was shot in the side by a HYDRA Cannon, falling onto the ground, gravely wounded. Black Widow had witnessed this assault and ran to his aid, while Captain America updated the team of Maximoff's arrival.

Black Widow then patched up the wound while Hulk destroyed the bunker before he could continue shooting at them. With Hawkeye in dire need of medical attention, Thor came to his aid and was able to get him back to the Quinjet to recover while the rest of their team continued with the mission and were able to capture both Baron von Strucker as well as the Scepter, although both of the Maximoff twins were still able to make their escape during all the ongoing chaos.

Treated by Doctor Cho
Barton's injury is treated by Doctor Helen Cho
With his wound now threatening his life, Barton was returned straight back to Avengers Tower where Natasha Romanoff stayed by his side while all of his injured skin was repaired by Doctor Helen Cho using a device called the Regeneration Cradle, which replaced his damaged skin with plastic. Joining them, Bruce Banner asked how Barton was doing, to which Tony Stark had jokingly stated that he was 'still Barton' and that he was thirsty.

Barton commenting on his newly repaired skin
Stark brought Barton a drink and he joked that he was already dying, to which Barton had insisted that he was going to live forever and be made out of plastic, as he continued to make his full recovery. When Cho asked if he had a girlfriend who would notice the difference with his new skin, Barton claimed her that he did not have a girlfriend, not mentioning his wife before they discussed the upcoming celebration that Stark would be hosting in the Avengers Tower in a few days.

The Avengers Celebration

Having fully recovered from his life-endangering injuries, Barton had then attended the party at Avengers Tower to celebrate their victory over HYDRA. Enjoying the company of his fellow Avengers as well as some of their other allies including James Rhodes and Sam Wilson, Barton also spent time speaking to his life-saving doctor Helen Cho during the party.

Barton challenges Thor's claims about Mjølnir
Before long, almost all of the other guests had departed, which had left only the other Avengers, Rhodes, Cho and Maria Hill to continue enjoying the celebrations about their victory over HYDRA as well as Baron Wolfgang von Strucker. As they sat around and drank, Barton had voiced disbelief that Mjølnir could only be lifted by Thor, since he believed this to be nothing more than a trick and not an enchantment from Asgard created by Odin, which Thor insisted was the truth.

Barton trying and failing to pick up Mjølnir
Thor then challenged Barton to lift his hammer, where everyone joked at him about lifting it, including Tony Stark who made a reference to Barton's injuries from their previous mission. Barton acknowledged Thor of his first encounter of him, seeing him fail to lift the hammer. Barton then attempted to lift the hammer but had failed, laughing at the ridiculousness of the challenge. As the others continued mocking him, Barton had then challenged Stark to lift up the hammer.

Barton and Tony Stark claim Mjølnir is rigged
Before long, all the others had attempted to pick up the hammer with no success: Bruce Banner had mocked his sudden transformation to Hulk, getting a little reaction from the others, while unbeknownst that Steve Rogers had moved it slightly during his own attempt, and Natasha Romanoff simply refused to take part in the challenge. Once everyone else failed, Barton and Stark claimed the game was rigged, which had simply left Thor to proclaim that they were unworthy.

Ultron Offensive
Attack on Avengers Tower
Barton and the Avengers encountering Ultron
The party was interrupted when a piercing screech rang through the room and a broken down and seemingly malfunctioning Iron Legion robot calling itself Ultron appeared. Barton then watched as Ultron claimed that he had been created by Tony Stark to bring about peace, but he also believed that the only way to achieve peace was the extinction of the Avengers, viewing them as destructive and a danger to the world.

Barton avoiding Ultron's attack on the team
When Natasha Romanoff questioned what Ultron's mission was, he told her that it was peace in their time and sent out a small army of Iron Legioners to then attack the Avengers, quickly subduing Steve Rogers by charging directly towards him at full speed. Barton found himself unarmed and was initially forced to hide during the sentries' assault, using his speed and agility to duck and dive out of the way of the blasts, leaping over and under the tables towards safety

Barton throwing Captain America his Shield
With Barton unable to get his weapons, he was forced to stay on the defense as Ultron had 
continued to try and kill him, with none of the Avengers able to do anything as one of the Ultron Sentries managed to steal the Scepter during all of the ongoing chaos. Eventually, more of the Sentries were destroyed by the team's efforts until Barton had found Captain America's Shield and managed to throw it to Rogers to help him to defeat the last sentry, ending their brief battle.

Barton witnesses Thor destroy Ultron's body
With all of his Sentries finally destroyed, Ultron commented on how dramatic the whole battle had been as Barton watched on alongside the other Avengers. Barton watched on in horror as Ultron claimed that the Avengers had only meant to save the world but not allow it to change, claiming that the extinction of the Avengers would save the world. Barton had then witnessed Thor throw Mjølnir in order to then finally destroy the original robotic body of Ultron apart.

Avengers Argument
Barton during the Avengers' argument
With the team confused and rattled after Ultron's attack, Barton had joined the rest of the Avengers to discuss what they had witnessed as they noted how Ultron had stolen the Avengers secret files, which then led James Rhodes to fear he could get ahold of the nuclear codes. As they discussed Ultron's motivations, Barton had noted how Ultron claimed to have killed somebody although there was nobody else in the building.

Barton witnesses Thor confronting Tony Stark
Although Barton stayed mostly silent during the ensuing argument on how this could have happened, he had witnessed the rest of the team's tempers being tested when Tony Stark tried to defend his actions in creating Ultron in the first place, which caused Thor to attack him by grabbing his throat while discussing how they would find both Ultron and the stolen Scepter. The team eventually calmed back down and had then resolved to discover what Ultron's next step would be.

Looking for Ultron
Barton giving an update to Laura Barton
Barton then used a few of his old contacts to find Ultron, but he had not heard from them so he called his wife to tell her he was alright. While on the phone, Steve Rogers then came over and told him they may have found key information regarding Ultron's location which caused Barton to hang up the call. When Rogers questioned who Barton was speaking to, Barton simply claimed it to be his girlfriend, which he had previously stated to Helen Cho he did not have.

Barton looks at files on Wolfgang von Strucker
As Barton then joined the team, the Avengers discovered that Ultron had just managed to track down and brutally murder Baron Wolfgang von Strucker in his prison cell, as well as stealing all of the Avengers files of Strucker before deleting them to keep them from tracking his movements. Barton was then also informed that Ultron had recruited the aid of Pietro and Wanda Maximoff in his quest as the team began finding ways of researching Strucker without any computer files.

Barton learns about Ulysses Klaue connection
They decided to go through all of their hard copy files that they have on him and any known associates which could help them find Ultron. As they looked through boxes of files, Tony Stark alerted them to one of Strucker's associates, Ulysses Klaue, that he knew back when he sold weapons several years earlier. They had soon discovered that he was connected with Wakanda, the source of Vibranium, which made them believe that this was where Ultron would be going to next.

Battle at the Salvage Yard
Hawkeye sneaking onto Ulysses Klaue's ship
Hawkeye then joined the team when they had located Ultron and the Maximoff twins on a ship off the coast of South Africa as Ultron was getting a supply of Vibranium from arms dealer Ulysses Klaue, taking Klaue hostage and cutting off his arm to take his Vibranium from him. While the other Avengers had confronted Ultron and the Maximoff twins directly, Hawkeye and Black Widow had stayed further back to provide cover, sneaking through the ship without being detected by Klaue's soldiers.

Hawkeye shooting at Ulysses Klaue's soldiers
Since peaceful negotiations quickly failed, Ultron and the Maximoffs attacked the Avengers, with Ultron and Iron Man battling through the skies, whilst at the same time Klaue sent his soldiers to attack both groups in revenge for losing his vibranium and his arm. Hawkeye had positioned himself onto a high vantage point, his specialty, where he could eliminate any enemies with great ease, firing multiple arrows at Klaue's soldiers before they could get close to his teammates.

Hawkeye takes out Ulysses Klaue's soldiers
Hawkeye and Black Widow focused their efforts on battling Klaue's soldiers, Hawkeye taking down many soldiers as the other Avengers fought the Ultron Sentries. As the battle continued to fall towards the Avengers' favor as Hawkeye used his Pluse Arrow to knock out the last of Klaue's soldiers, the Scarlet Witch had then stepped onto the field and managed to entrance most of the Avengers with her power, causing them all to become distracted by some terrible visions.

Hawkeye manages to stun Scarlet Witch
Just as Hawkeye overlooked the battlefield to ensure that there were no other soldiers loyal to Klaue out there, Scarlet Witch attempted to entrance him as well. However, as soon as Scarlet Witch got close to him, Hawkeye had incapacitated her with a Mind-Warping Arrow, not allowing himself to be put under mind control again, following all his experiences with Loki and the Scepter, as Hawkeye then prepared to take Scarlet Witch into the Avengers' custody to be questioned.

Hawkeye being thrown aside by Quicksilver
However, just before Hawkeye had been able to capture the Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver charged in and threw Hawkeye through a window before he whisked her away to safety before she could be captured, with Hawkeye mockingly telling Quicksilver to run from him. Hawkeye then tried to call the Avengers, but he did not receive a response as they were all under the effects of the hypnosis. He went to check on them, as he saw Black Widow defeated and barely conscious.

Hawkeye checks on Black Widow's condition
Having retreated outside, the Maximoff twins continued their mission and attacked Bruce Banner, which had caused him to transform into a rage-filled Hulk who charged to Johannesburg. To defend the people, Iron Man flew in to confront Hulk, along the way Iron Man had asked if Black Widow would be able to perform her lullaby to calm him back down, before Hawkeye informed him that she was currently too weak and traumatized to join the fight, along with the rest of the team.

Returning Home
Hawkeye flies the Avengers towards his home
The Avengers all gathered into their Quinjet, defeated by Ultron and the Maximoff twins. As Barton piloted the jet, Maria Hill had informed them that public opinion on the Avengers was unpopular due to the massive battle between Hulk and Iron Man in his "Hulkbuster" armor in the middle of South Africa; at the same time, many of the members were still suffering from the effects of Wanda Maximoff's visions.

Barton bringing the Avengers into his home
Hill stated that there was no information about Bruce Banner's arrest order yet but recommended that they lie low for the time being due to the effects of this most recent battle. Knowing the Avengers needed time to get away and recover before their next fight, Barton then decided to take the team back to his homestead, since no one would be able to find them there. Barton had then informed Tony Stark that he would be taking the team to a safe house for their recovery.

Barton introduces the Avengers to his wife
Once the[Avengers arrived at his farm, Barton led them into his house, while the team was unsure of where they were. When the team entered, they found a pregnant woman, who was soon revealed to be Barton's wife, Laura. Barton immediately hugged his wife and children. The rest of the Avengers were left confused as they were not aware of Barton having a family, which made Stark believe that they were all actually just S.H.I.E.L.D. agents working undercover.

Barton being reunited with all his children
Barton then introduced the team to his family. Seeing how surprised they were at the revelation, Barton explained how Nick Fury had set up this hideaway for him when he joined S.H.I.E.L.D. and requested that the team keep his secret. While Natasha Romanoff spoke with Laura about when their new baby was due to be born, Thor decided to leave the farm to find Erik Selvig and investigate his vision in detail. Barton and the others then began recovering during their stay.

Place on the Avengers
Barton and Laura discussing the Avengers
As Barton then got changed, Laura felt Barton's chest where his skin had just already repaired with the Regeneration Cradle. Laura then informed Barton that some of the Avengers will have to sleep together which Barton knew would not go well, which lead to Laura asking about how long Natasha Romanoff and Bruce Banner had been seeing each other. However, Barton was unaware of this, which Laura found cute and jokingly called him "Hawkeye" for not seeing their relationship.

Barton talks about his place on the Avengers
Laura expressed her concern about whether Barton should continue being a member of the Avengers, which he initially believed meant that she believed they did not actually need him, but she instead had revealed that she felt they needed him too much, since all the others' teamwork leaves a lot to be desired and she did not believe that they would support him and all the work that he did. As Laura touched her husband's chest, she noted that she could feel the difference.

Barton doing some woodwork with his son
Having settled in, Barton and the Avengers then spent some time at his Homestead trying to get their minds straight following their defeat at the hands of the Maximoff Twins in South Africa. Barton had then joined his two children outside and did some more woodworking with his son for a brand new crib for his unborn son, while also managing to convince Tony Stark and Steve Rogers to assist him by chopping some wood together while they had discussed their next battle.

Nick Fury's Return
Barton listening to Nick Fury's speech
As their team got back together, Nick Fury arrived after having been called there by Maria Hill. That night Barton rejoined the rest of the Avengers as they gathered in his kitchen and spoke with Fury about regaining the motivation to fight back against Ultron. Fury had also explained that Ultron had been unable to access nuclear codes due to someone blocking all his attacks. Barton had then teased Stark by beating him at darts, hitting the bullseye with multiple darts.

Barton discusses Ultron's next possible action
As Natasha Romanoff noted she had hoped Fury had more to offer, Fury gave them a speech to inspire them to get up and fight against Ultron, telling them to stand and fight as a team once again. While they discussed what Ultron's next move against them could possibly be, Bruce Banner worked out that Ultron would create another body made of synthetic tissue using his stolen Vibranium, which would be mixed with the Regeneration Cradle, and would do this with Helen Cho's help.

One Last Project
Barton promising his wife it's his final mission
The team then made a plan to deal with the situation, Hawkeye going with Captain America and Black Widow to Seoul in order to confront Ultron directly before he could escape, while Tony Stark would go to NEXUS Internet Hub in order to learn more about why Ultron had been unable to access the nuclear codes. While the team prepared to leave they collected their uniforms and their equipment ready for their battle against Ultron, Barton went to his wife to say goodbye.
