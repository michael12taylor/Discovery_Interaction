He was also glad that Simmons did not kill Ward either, but Simmons admitted that she had indeed tried to kill him.

Fitz having a meeting with Phil Coulson and Lance Hunter
Fitz was in Coulson's office along with Coulson and Lance Hunter while S.H.I.E.L.D. was on the way to meet the Inhumans. Hunter doubted Coulson's decision of sending Robert Gonzales to meet Jiaying and not him. Even Fitz questioned the council's decision, but Coulson said to him that it was not the council versus them anymore and they were right about their decision. He said that he had not always made the right call, especially where it had came to Skye, and if they did not trust the council, S.H.I.E.L.D. would fall again. Hunter joked that S.H.I.E.L.D. would fall again if a dozen enhanced people will bring terror on them, to which Fitz agreed. Coulson then said that he thought that they had spent too much time together. Just then, Melinda May informed them that the Inhumans turned over Calvin Zabo, to which Coulson said that they will deal with this when they had returned to the base.

Finding Bobbi Morse
Fitz and Phil Coulson what happen at the Afterlife
After a while, Melinda May talked with Phil Coulson, saying that Bobbi Morse had not arrived at Afterlife yet. Coulson sent Lance Hunter to check what had happened to her. Suddenly, Jemma Simmons joined the conversation and said that Robert Gonzales had allegedly shot Jiaying. Fitz said that he had got what he always wanted, but Coulson said that Gonzales had not done this and ordered them to find him.

Fitz learns that Bobbi Morse is missing
Fitz then joined Hunter in the search for Morse. He checked the flight records from the base and saw that Morse had left the base with a Quinjet before the three others left for Afterlife. Hunter told him to change access and check the security cameras to the time before she left the the base. Fitz discovered that May had left the base twice; one time with Morse and the other time with the delegation of S.H.I.E.L.D. to Afterlife. Hunter realized that it was Agent 33 who was disguised as May and took Morse on a Quinjet. Fitz asked Hunter what Agent 33 wanted with Morse. Shocked by their discovery, they went to Coulson's office and showed the footage to Coulson, Melinda May and Jemma Simmons. Hunter said they found where the Quinjet was and May volunteered to take him there.

Calvin Zabo's Transformation
Fitz getting Calvin Zabo ready to be revived
Calvin Zabo was brought to the Playground, to be interrogated by Phil Coulson. Where Coulson discovered that Jiaying staged the attack of S.H.I.E.L.D. on Afterlife so the Inhumans would think that they declared war on them. Where all of a sudden, during Coulson interrogation, Zabo started to have a heart attack. Zabo was brought to the lab where Jemma Simmons tried to revive him. Failing to save him, she asked Fitz for an adrenaline syringe.

Fitz faces the enhanced Calvin Zabo
When she injected him, Zabo's heart started work again, but he became monstrous with remarkable strength. Zabo was locked up in the medical pod, trying to get out, Coulson asked Fitz for suggestions and Fitz said that I.C.E.R.s could be a good start. As Zabo escaped from the pod, Fitz with Coulson and Simmons tried to shoot Zabo with I.C.E.R.s, but the attack was ineffective. Coulson ordered the two agents to go so he could try to calm Zabo down. Zabo would start searching the base, looking for agents to kill, until he found Fitz and Simmons. The two agents would lure Zabo into the hangar where Coulson could reason with him.

Preparing for a Counter Strike
Fitz informing Phil Coulson about the Hijacking of the Iliad
Phil Coulson convinced Calvin Zabo to assist them against Jiaying, and Zabo was put under armed guard while Jemma Simmons helped counteract the effects of his formula, resulting in the reverse of his physical changes. Fitz informed Coulson that a distress beacon from the Iliad was expanded to all of S.H.I.E.L.D. channels. Coulson realized that the Inhumans had hijacked the ship while they were fighting Zabo.

Fitz builds his Quantum Field Disruptors
Coulson asked Fitz if he got Lance Hunter and Melinda May on the line, but he responded that he could not communicate with them. Fitz then came to Coulson's office to inform him that he had built Quantum Field Disruptors that could make Gordon stay in a single location. Fitz and Coulson visited the room where Bobbi Morse would be analyzed since she had been badly injured. Coulson asked Simmons if Zabo was stable enough to join them in their mission to retake the Iliad, but Fitz and Simmons were surprised to hear that.

Fitz talking with Jemma Simmons before the mission
While preparing himself for going with Phil Coulson, Melinda May, and Calvin Zabo to retake the Iliad, Fitz was visited by Jemma Simmons. She started to explain that after she saw Lance Hunter with Bobbi Morse, she realized that they had never spoken about what Fitz had said her in the bottom of the ocean. Fitz was surprised to hear that. He said to her that there was nothing to be said about about it, but Simmons said that maybe there was. Coulson then came and informed Fitz that they were on the move, so Fitz followed him, leaving Simmons standing alone and crying to herself.

Retaking of the Iliad
Fitz informing Phil Coulson about Jiaying's trap
In one of the Quinjets heading to the Iliad, Fitz informed Coulson that someone had changed the S.O.S. signal. Coulson realized that it was Skye who had done that and Fitz said that she warned them that they were flying to a trap. Coulson ordered the other Quinjets to fall back while they still flew to the ship. As they landed on the the ship, Fitz got another message from Skye, which warned them about synthetic Terrigen Crystals in the HVAC room. Zabo then understood Jiaying's plan: she wanted to use the Terrigen Mist in the crystals to kill all the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Coulson and Fitz went to find the Crystals, while Zabo went to find Jiaying and May went to the HVAC room.

Fitz ready to battles Gordon
The two eventually found Alphonso Mackenzie protecting a box full of Crystals from Gordon. The three discussed, that if Gordon get's his hands of the that everyone would turn into a statue. Fitz started placing the Quantum Field Disruptors in place, this would trap Gordon inside the room so he could no longer teleport away. Fitz activated the devices in success, preventing Gordon from teleporting, much to the confusion of Gordon, questioning why he can't escape. Fitz would grab an iron pole, responded "Science, biatch."

Fitz killing Gordon with the iron pole
The three S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, would try to hit Gordon but even when he stuck in the room he still have the advantages of teleporting around the room. Under Gordon made a mistake when he teleported behind Fitz, causing the iron pole Fitz was held to become embedded in Gordon's chest. As Gordon was falling down dying, he dropped the Terrigen Crystal that he had his his hand, which was caught by Coulson. As Coulson arm started to turn to stone, Mackenzie used his axe to cut off Coulson's hand and saving him.

New Programs
Working on the Zephyr One
Fitz and Alphonso Mackenzie discussing the alien artifact
With the threat quelled, Phil Coulson asked Fitz to work on a new plane for his new program he founded. Fitz also helped Alphonso Mackenzie, who was now the head of the Alien Artifacts Department, to work on the Monolith on the Iliad. Although Jemma Simmons continued to push the idea of examining the Monolith, Mackenzie insisted that they must not open the box in a thousand years as it was too dangerous.

Fitz asking Jemma Simmons to dinner
While Fitz and Jemma Simmons worked on the stone, he awkwardly tried to ask Simmons to go to dinner with him, although Simmons at first believed he was asking her to eat generally, she soon realized what he meant and agreed to have a date with him. Fitz leaned on the Monolith's casing and stumbled, causing the lock on the case to loosen. With Simmons having finally agreed, Fitz left the room. Without knowing it however, he had caused the stone's casing to unlock allowing the Monolith to swallow her. Simmons then disappeared without a trace.

Not Given Up Hope
Seeking Answers
Fitz searches for answers about the Monolith
Not willing to give up hope on finding Jemma Simmons again, Fitz dedicated his time and work to studying the Monolith in the hopes of finding an answer. This led him to questioning if she had been sent to a parallel dimension or lost to the Quantum Realm like Janet van Dyne. The more questions he asked, the more time he took off from S.H.I.E.L.D.. Eventually he learned of a scroll casing which was said to hold the answer to the Monolith's power; Fitz tracked the scroll to the criminal Yusef Hadad, who had stolen it.

Fitz confronts Yusef Hadad
Fitz tracked Hadad to Morocco and offered him the contents of his briefcase; Hadad's men captured Fitz and only spoke to him when they discovered the briefcase could not be opened without the password. Fitz explained his reasons for coming and told Hadad that he would only open the case if Hadad gave him the scroll casing. Hadad acquiesced and handed over the casing, ordering Fitz to open the briefcase; Fitz did and handed over the Splinter Bombs inside, explaining that they were the weapons that killed Sunil Bakshi. When Hadad tried to kill Fitz with the bomb, it activated the flash grenade inside. During the ensuing chaos, Fitz escaped with the scroll casing while Hadad's men shot at him.

Never Giving Up
Fitz refuses to accept Jemma Simmons' death
Back at the Playground, Fitz found Phil Coulson waiting for him. Coulson tried to sympathize with Fitz's feelings by comparing his loss of Melinda May to Fitz losing Jemma Simmons; Coulson attempted to convince him to move on but Fitz remained determined. He smashed open the casing and read the scroll, translating the word to "Death". Seeming to accept this as the final confirmation that Simmons had been killed by the Monolith, Coulson comforted Fitz and told him it was time to finally move on and continue with their work.

Fitz getting angry at the Monolith
Unable to accept that Jemma Simmons was dead, Fitz, after Coulson left, grabbed a shotgun and charged into the room containing the Monolith, ignoring the warning signs and kicking open the door. Without hesitation or fear, Fitz shot the locks of the Monolith's casing and stepped into its protective box. Fitz at first quietly spoke to the stone, asking it to do something and give him an answer; when nothing happened, he began to lose his temper before screaming at the stone and demanding it to do something, all while punching and kicking it to make it respond. Despite his screams, tears and strikes, the Monolith remained a stone and did not give him the answers he sought.

Fitz is comforted by Bobbi Morse
Lance Hunter and Bobbi Morse then charged into the room followed by Phil Coulson, Alphonso Mackenzie and Daisy Johnson. They pulled Fitz away from the Monolith and locked its case seconds before it transformed into its liquid state again. Coulson berated Fitz over being so foolish, noting that he had already lost Jemma Simmons to it and could not afford to lose him too. Fitz apologized but assured him that he would never give up on finding his friend. As he sat on the ground, Fitz noticed a strange sand on his fingers which he had gained from touching the Monolith; seeing the sand gave Fitz an idea and he ran from the room.

Fitz explains his new theory
Once he had confirmed his theory, Fitz called the team into Phil Coulson's office where he pitched them the idea that the sand was impossible and should not exist; therefore, it must confirm that the Monolith is a transportation device and had sent Jemma Simmons to another point across the universe. Coulson tried to make Fitz accept that it was possible that although he could be correct, Simmons may well be dead anyway having been lost for months; this did not stop Fitz and they agreed to continue researching his theory. While Fitz confirmed what he needed, Coulson sent Lance Hunter on his mission to hunt down and assassinate Grant Ward.

Help from an Asgardian
Fitz visits Elliot Randolph in prison
Fitz joined Phil Coulson and Bobbi Morse in traveling to Norway to seek the help of the Asgardian professor Elliot Randolph, who had been arrested for getting drunk and damaging property. Although Randolph initially made it clear that he had no wish to help as he was trying to keep his Asgardian powers quiet due to the recent fears of the public, Fitz made it clear they did not have time to wait and Coulson was able to change his mind with a threat of handing him over to the ATCU. Randolph reluctantly agreed and ripped the bars off his cell and left with them.
