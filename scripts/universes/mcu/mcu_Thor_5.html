<html><p>He then joined everyone as they watched Clint Barton tested Time Travel, for which they were successfully, so they decided to start planning the Time Heist. They all gathered as they discussed the best way to retrieve all of the Infinity Stones from the past, needing to pick the best points in time. Steve Rogers suggested that they start with the Aether, and asked Thor, as he is the only one who had encountered it. However, they discovered that Thor had fallen asleep during the brainstorm, which they jokingly thought he was dead.

Thor explaining his history with the Aether
He then awoke and went to inform them on what he knew about the Aether, but due to his unstable state, he started to ramble. He informed them that it was not a stone, but a liquified weapon forged from the Reality Stone itself, before suggesting to contain the Aether as its powers are unpredictable. He then started telling the history of the Aether: how it was secured by Bor from Dark Elves and that in 2013, Jane Foster became possessed by it, so he took her to Asgard to help her. He showed them pictures of Foster, Darcy Lewis, Erik Selvig, and Ian Boothby during those events.  

Thor goes completely off topic
However, after the mention of these events, Thor remembered how it was when his mother was killed and that now he and Foster are no longer dating. Thor then became completely distracted from his task and began to go off topic about life and how nothing is permanent. Tony Stark went to stop him, but he finished his point, before asking for a Bloody Mary. Thor then proceeded to sit through the rest of the brainstorming, making himself his drink.

Thor joining the Avengers for the Time Heist
After a few days of planning out the heist, Thor joined by Rocket Raccoon going to Asgard in 2013 to steal the Reality Stone, while a team went to 2012 to steal the Mind, Space and Time Stone, and another team going to 2014 to steal the Power and Soul Stone. They all then suited up in their Advanced Tech Suit and made their way to the Quantum Tunnel, where they all listened to Rogers' speech before going to their set destinations.

Theft of the Reality Stone
Thor quietly passes by an imprisoned Loki
Thor and Rocket Raccoon traveled to Asgard in 2013 to extract the Aether. Passing through the Asgardian Dungeons, Thor peeked at an incarcerated Loki in his cell levitating a cup in the air before continuing to the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf. Hiding behind a large column in the palace, Thor and Rocket spotted Jane Foster being escorted by a maiden to one of the chambers to rest and Thor confirmed that it was her.

Thor and Rocket Raccoon discuss their plan
The two then hid in the Royal Palace as they discussed their plan, with the suggestion that Thor entertain Foster while Rocket uses the device to extract the Aether from her body. However, Thor changed the subject and attempted to steal some more wine from Odin's cellars. A disturbed Rocket asked Thor if he thought he had drunk enough already but Thor ignored his advice and began making his way to the cellar.

Thor has a panic attack during the mission
Suddenly, Thor saw his mother Frigga and started going into a panic attack, remembering that she would die that day at the hands of Malekith and Kurse during the Sacking of Asgard. As Frigga and her maidens exited the hall, Rocket briefly brought Thor to his senses by slapping him and reminding Thor that he lost the Guardians of the Galaxy to the Snap as well. Still, Thor was unable to face any of his past and ran away, leaving Rocket to extract the Reality Stone from Foster by himself.

Thor being given some advice by Frigga
Wandering around the Royal Palace while spying on Frigga, Thor was surprised by his mother when she confronted him and realized that he was from the future. Thor tried to pretend he was his former self, but quickly dropped the facade. He told his mother that he wanted to speak with her, and Frigga hugged him in comfort. In one of her chambers, Thor confided in Frigga about his failure to stop Thanos five years ago in his timeline, as well as him killing the Mad Titan out of anger. Frigga assured Thor he was not an idiot, but indeed a failure, making him just like everyone else.

Thor says goodbye to his mother in the past
Frigga gave Thor advice, reminding him that everyone failed at fulfilling others' expectations at a certain point in life, and their true worth is found by following their own path. Thor then tried to warn his mother about her imminent death, but was cut off by Frigga not wanting to know, as she was prepared to meet her fate with dignity. Suddenly, Rocket rushed in, having successfully obtained the Aether, telling Thor they had to go. Frigga gave Thor some final words to help him as they hugged goodbye.

Thor learns that he is still worthy of Mjølnir
Before they could leave, Thor tried to summon Mjølnir to see if he was still worthy. It took a moment but much to his delight, the hammer came to him, giving Thor the final reassurance that he could still do good despite how he feels about himself. Thor then decided to take Mjølnir with him as he and Rocket returned to the present after bidding farewell to Frigga one last time.

Natasha Romanoff's Death
The Avengers mourn Natasha Romanoff
Thor and Rocket Raccoon, along with the rest of the Avengers returned to the present, where they all celebrated in the mission's success. However, this was cut short when Clint Barton fell to his knees, as everyone noticed that Natasha Romanoff was not there, understanding she did not survive the mission. Mourning the loss of their friend, the original Avengers all gathered outisde.

Thor discusses Natasha Romanoff's death
After Tony Stark asked about whether Romanoff had any family they had to inform, Thor was confused by their acceptance of her death, believing that they could use the Infinity Stones to bring her back. He desperately tried to get them to agree with him, now trying to do right, but he was corrected by Barton who stated that she could not be brought back. However, Thor did not believe him due to his inexperience in magical world. 

Thor accepts that Natasha Romanoff is dead
However, Barton assured him that her sacrifice couldn't be undone, according to the Stonekeeper, causing him to get angry and yell at Thor to go talk to him himself. This then put to rest Thor's hopes of bringing her back, causing him to once again be struck by more loss and pain that he was trying to overcome. After Bruce Banner accepted her loss, they all decided to not let their friend's death go without meaning, so they began working on constructing a Nano Gauntlet to contain the Stones.

The Second Snap
Thor volunteering to wield the Nano Gauntlet
Tony Stark, Rocket Raccoon and Bruce Banner successfully forged a Nano Gauntlet, leaving the only question as to who would snap their fingers. Thor, continuing his search for redemption, immediately volunteered to do it, but was met with strong refusal by everyone else.

Thor arguing with all of the other Avengers
Thor stated they they can't waste time trying to decide who will do it, and that as the "Strongest Avenger" he should fill the role. However, they continued to stop his attempts, which he desperately told them he wanted to do something right. But Stark informed him that not only was the power of the combined Stones too dangerous, but that he was in no condition to wield them.

Thor shields Rocket Raccoon from the danger
Thor still tried to make his case, but was stopped when Banner claimed that he had to be him. Banner informed them that none of them could survive, seeing the damage it did to Thanos and that the radiation was mostly gamma, giving the possibility that he could. With Banner being the one to snap his fingers, the rest all suited up and stood around him as they locked down the New Avengers Facility. When Banner put the gauntlet on, Thor shielded Rocket in the event something went wrong.

Thor checking on Bruce Banner's condition
As they watched Banner be affected by the gauntlet's power, Thor grew concerned and told them to get it off him, but Banner told them he was fine and proceeded. Banner was successfully able to snap his finger, but it caused him to faint. They all gathered around him as Thor tried to comfort Banner, not sure if it had worked. Suddenly, they were attacked when the facility was bombed by Thanos from 2014 causing them all to be separated within the destroyed facility, Thor ending up with Stark and Steve Rogers.

Confronting Thanos Again
Thor observes Thanos from the wreckage
After the attack ended, Thor made his way out of the wreckage that once was the New Avengers Facility, where he noticed Thanos sitting outside. 

Thor alongside Captain America and Iron Man
When he was joined by Iron Man and Captain America, he informed them that Thanos had been doing nothing, as they addressed that the location of the Infinity Stones were unknown and that Thanos didn't have them. Thor told them that Thanos waiting down there was clearly a trap for them, but Iron Man responded that he didn't care, much to Thor's agreement. 

Thor summons both Mjølnir and Stormbreaker
Planning to face Thanos, Thor then summoned a bolt of lightning, which provided him with armor, as well as calling upon both Mjølnir and Stormbreaker. He then expressed his desire to kill the Titan again, this time properly. They then made their way to the ground, where they started to approach Thanos, who began to talk about their failures to stop him before, albeit the future version of him.

Thor prepares to battle Thanos
The three then surrounded Thanos, as he continued to talk, explaining how despite his plans to bring balance to the universe, complications still present themselves, in this case the Avengers. Thanos then announced his goal of destroying the universe as it is and using the stones to create a new universe, one that's truly grateful for the life he had given them. He then put on his armor as Thor channeled lightning through him, preparing for the fight. Captain America objected to Thanos' plans, but he claimed that they would all be dead to be indifferent to it.

Thor uses his lightning to boost Iron Man
They all then rushed the Titan, taking him on together, as he managed to fend them all off. The fight became more heated, despite their combined efforts to defeat him, as he was able to keep fighting. Iron Man then ordered Thor to charge him up with his lightning, which allowed him to blast multiple beams at Thanos, which he blocked. Thor then launched Mjølnir at Thanos by hitting it with Stormbreaker, which knocked Iron Man away from almost being ripped apart, but rendering him unconscious.

Thor facing off with Thanos
Thor then continued to face off against Thanos, rushing towards him until he was able to disarm him from his Double-Edged Sword. However, Thanos, too, managed to disarm Thor, and then began to throw the God of Thunder around, ruthlessly beating him. Pinned, Thor tried to summon Stormbreaker to defend himself, but Thanos snatched it in mid-air and tried to cut into Thor's chest with it.

Thor witnesses Captain America wield Mjølnir
However, before he could finish Thor, Thanos was knocked away from Thor when Mjølnir struck him in the face. The two then discovered Captain America wielding Mjølnir, bringing delight to Thor as he had always suspected that he was worthy. However, Thanos then knocked Thor out, and proceeded to fight Captain America.

Battle of Earth
Thor charges towards Thanos' entire army
Thor eventually awoke, where he discovered Thanos' entire army had arrived on Earth. However, at the same time, numerous portals appeared opposite the army, with heroes, including those who died to the Snap, to help in the fight. As they all stood together, Thor summoned Stormbreaker and flies to the assembled heroes, as Captain America led the charge, with Thor letting out a loud battle cry.

Thor fights alongside Captain America
Thor, along with everyone else rushed towards Thanos' army, where he used Stormbreaker to defeat many enemies. Thor fought alongside Captain America, as the two switched between using both of Thor's weapons, of which they were worthy of. However, after they cleared all enemies in their area, Thor, ending up with Mjølnir, asked to switch with Captain America for Stormbreaker, as it was more powerful.

Thor tries to kill Thanos with Stormbreaker
Thor continued to fight in the epic battle, but when Captain Marvel was stopped from returning the Nano Gauntlet, Thor, Iron Man and Captain America rushed over to stop Thanos from getting it. Thor fought Thanos off with both his weapons, and tried to get the Gauntlet, but couldn't keep Thanos away. With the assistance of Captain America, they tried to push Stormbreaker into the Titan, but he headbutted Thor, knocking him out, followed by Captain America, too.

Thor sadly watches Iron Man as he dies
After a heated fight, Iron Man was able to steal the Infinity Stones off Thanos, and used them to wipe out the entire army, with Thanos soon following. However, this action ended up killing Iron Man, due to the power of the stones. Everyone then gathered around the fallen hero, where Thor sadly watched his friend in his final moments. Following Hawkeye, everyone then knelt before him, out of respect.

Without a Path
New King of Asgard
Thor attending the funeral of Tony Stark
Later, Thor attended the funeral for Tony Stark, where he watched Stark's recorded message with his family, Happy Hogan, James Rhodes, and the remaining original Avengers. They all then went outside where he watched as Pepper Potts and Morgan Stark placed Stark's Arc Reactor on the lake. Thor stood alongside Bruce Banner as they mourned the death of their friend and fellow Avenger.

Thor meeting with Valkyrie at New Asgard
Afterwards, Thor, who had decided to take some time away, went back to New Asgard, where he met with Valkyrie on a cliff. She asked when he would return, which he alluded that he wouldn't be. Valkyrie reminded him that the Asgardians needed their king, which he agreed with; however, he noted that she was their leader, not him.

Thor appoints Valkyrie as the King of Asgard
Valkyrie initially thought Thor was joking, but he assured her that it was very much the case. He told her that he was not meant to be king, despite it being his birthright, and that he needed to find his true purpose. Valkyrie then took to Thor's words of her being a leader and accepted the role, promising that she would make changes.

Thor discusses his life having no current path
They then shook hands, as Valkyrie then asked what Thor would now be doing with his life. However, he was not able to respond, for once not knowing what he was to do with his life, having no path outside of Asgard. However, he had arranged with the Guardians of the Galaxy transportation, joining them on their travels, in hopes to discover a new path for his life.

Joining the Guardians
Thor arriving onboard the Benatar
Thor then made his way to the Benatar after Rocket Raccoon called out to him while he was talking with Valkyrie. Once he came onboard, he reunited with the Guardians of the Galaxy, mainly Groot, having spent more time with him before. 

Thor becomes a new Guardian of the Galaxy
He then joined Peter Quill, asking their next destination, as he touched the map. Threatened, Quill moved the map back and reconfirmed that he was in charge, which Thor agreed with, subtly challenging it by moving the map back. Quill then called Thor out, but Thor acted completely compliant, but still undermining him by calling him "Quail".

Thor challenging Peter Quill's leadership
Drax then joined in and suggested that they fight each other for the honor of being the leader, which the other members supported. However, they both hesitantly declined the duel, laughing it off as Thor assured that everyone knew who was in charge. However, this was still concerning for Quill, who stated that it was him, which Thor agreed with as if allowing him. One year later, Thor would still be on his journey through space.

Time Heist
Loki's Escape
Thor saves Tony Stark's life
In an alternate 2012, after defeating Loki in the Battle of New York, Thor helped escort him to bring him directly to Odin to be punished. When they reached the first floor of Stark Tower, they ran into Alexander Pierce who demanded they hand over Loki and the Tesseract. An argument then broke out between Thor, Tony Stark and Pierce over what would happen with Loki and the Tesseract.

Thor searches for Loki
However, this was disrupted when Stark suddenly experienced a heart attack, which was caused by Ant-Man from 2023 tampering with his Arc Reactor. Stark then collapsed to the ground, but was saved when Thor used Mjølnir to send an electrical current to the Arc Reactor, reactivating it. After checking on Stark, Thor then noticed that the Tesseract, along with Loki, were gone.

Personality
Before his banishment to Earth, Thor was initially conceited, arrogant, immature and stubborn. He had proven to be bloodthirsty and enjoyed the challenge of battle and combat, Laufey even states on Johutenheim that he craved war, with the Frost Giants in particular, due to being Odin's own wars with them convincing him that they were vicious monsters. This bloodlust began as early as his childhood, with Thor then jesting that he'll hunt down the Frost Giants and slay them all if he becomes king. His adoptive brother Loki even comments that Thor would have killed the entire race of Frost Giants with his bare hands as an adult. However, it should be noted that Thor still had some honorable traits, as he notably supported his friend Sif in her goals to become a great warrior, while most others would not take her seriously. In his heart, he only wishes to live up to the expectations of his father to become a great king but, in truth, he did have difficulty finding the difference between a ruler and a warrior and what makes each a good man.

Thor was quick to anger and could act rashly to a situation such as when Asgard was broken into his first instinct was to attack the Johtuns to dissuade them to ever do a similar stunt again. Later on, he, Sif and the Warriors Three launched an all-out attack on Jotunheim, ignoring the fact that they'd be sorely outnumbered which seems to stem from arrogance, although at the time he only went to achieve answers on how they infiltrated Asgard. When the Frost Giants had ruined his coronation, he reacted by angrily flipping over a table and finally when he was later insulted by a Frost Giant on Jotunheim, Thor reacts by promptly decapitating the former with Mjølnir and started a fight with the other Frost Giants.

Due to coming from royalty and spending all of his life in Asgard, Thor was out of place in Midgard as his boisterous personality was often part of his charm in Asgard and he was unaware of the customs and norms on Earth. For instance, when he had smashed a cup of a drink that he liked while bellowing "another" (thinking it appropriate in Earth), demanded a horse at a pet store and walked in the middle of a street. His vocabulary and terms of endearment were also antiquated and out of place in the modern times, he was trapped within, baffling everyone around him and leading them to believe he was delusional even though it was simply how people spoke upon Asgard. After returning to arrest Loki, Thor had seemed to gain tact but still thought that Bilgesnipe were existent on Earth. In addition, Thor was shown to initially be quite vain and egotistical. For example, while being restrained by doctors and guards at a hospital, he describes himself as "mighty". He was also left dumbfounded when he found himself restrained only claiming in disbelief that "it's not possible" due to never losing a battle beforehand with his godlike powers.

When his irresponsibility and arrogance placed his home Asgard and the Nine Realms in danger, his father, Odin, banished Thor to Earth and stripped him of all his powers. That, in addition to him discovering that he was no longer worthy of Mjølnir's power, put Thor into a state of depression. This, along with Loki lying that Odin died, humbles him greatly and during his time on Midgard, fell in love with the human Jane Foster which finally taught him the humility and wisdom he was lacking. Hence, after his adoptive brother Loki sent the Destroyer to kill him, Thor defended the Warriors Three and the townspeople of New Mexico and selflessly gave up his own life for the town, thereby finally became worthy of Mjølnir again. After regaining his power, Thor would take too often holding back his great powers, unless battling an opponent of equivalent strength and durability, which Thor notably holding back in all of his duels with Loki, believing that "[his] brother was still in there somewhere".

Thor, however, did still appear to be somewhat hot-tempered, as when he met with Iron Man for the first time, the two battled in the woods, with Thor then proceeding to charge at Captain America, when the latter intervened. However, he quickly came to see that he and the other Avengers were fighting for the same cause and befriended them, notably saving Black Widow from an enraged Hulk.

At this time, Thor would become far more responsible than before, since as soon as the Bifrost was regenerated by energy from the Tesseract, Thor took it upon himself to safeguard the worlds of the Nine Realms that had fallen into chaos and conflict in the Asgardians' absence. Following losing Foster after the Bifrost destruction, Thor also became somewhat somber and Sif herself noticed this personality shift from how he used to celebrate all night long to simply staring idly at the ongoing feast of his friends. Thor has learned from his mistakes and has grown to such lengths that he surpasses Loki and even Odin. He was willing to commit treason and spare his enemies if it was honorable as he destroys the Bifrost to spare Jotunheim and free Loki, going against the Allfather by taking the Aether to Svartalfheim to destroy Malekith as Odin's way would result in countless of Asgardians' death.

While Thor was destined to become the King of Asgard, however, he eventually realized, that he couldn't actively protect the Nine Realms from the throne, and selflessly denied his birthright, even offering Mjølnir to (who he thought was) Odin. After helping the Avengers defeat Ultron, Thor temporarily left his friends, taking it upon himself to find the rest of the Infinity Stones and learn the identity of the ultimate enemy.

Whatever remained of Thor’s boastful personality has seemingly vanished since Odin’s death and Hela destroying Mjølnir. Without an object to channel his supernatural powers, even though he retained his immense superhuman might, and with the guilt of having failed to save his father, Thor believed he was worthless which made any remains of arrogance that he had completely disappeared, as can be seen with his interactions towards people have become more awkward and overly-excitable such as when he realized that Brunnhilde was a Valkyrie on Sakaar, he tried to explain and convince her to join him rather than ordering her like he would have done with any other Asgardians. Nevertheless, while Thor's arrogance has disappeared fully, he still remains utmostly confident and assured in his abilities as a warrior, as can be witnessed when he told Grandmaster to “point [him] in the direction of whoever’s ass [he] has to kick,” despite his champion being praised as a savage opponent. The knowledge of how Asgard really rose to power further humbled Thor even more, as he was shocked and dismayed of his father's war seeking past. Although his love and respect for Odin remained as high as ever, he has come to accept that Odin's darker nature indirectly caused Ragnarok and openly admitted that Odin had flaws in his own right, even saying that Hela had a right to be angry with Odin. Though Thor has mostly unlocked the full magnitude of his powers since Asgard’s destruction and Hela's defeat there still remains an awkwardness to his character, especially when compared to his previous personality. During his original coronation, he yelled uproariously towards his subjects in a victorious manner but when ascending to King of Asgard he only awkwardly waved to the Asgardians behind him.

After Thanos attacked and massacred half of his kind, with only he himself as the only known survivor of the half that was slaughtered by Thanos, and witnessing Loki's death, Thor was greatly saddened and left furious by having lost his brother who he had just reconciled with and the deaths of the Asgardians and gained a strong desire to kill Thanos to avenge his people and brother, which he vowed to do so to the Titan, although Thanos was not fazed and simply taunted him that Loki is truly dead. Out of all the deaths of the Asgardians, Thor is particularly riddled with grief and anger over the deaths of his family and to a lesser degree, Heimdall, who Thor considered his best friend, and he lamented the fact that he is the sole survivor and only surviving legacy of the Asgardian Royal Family so strongly that he showed some sadness when talking to Hela, who had ruthlessly tried to kill him and even cried upon talking about Odin, Frigga and Loki. Although he retains much of his old personality, Thor has become noticeably more somber and sullen. He also seems to have gained a new perspective on why he had prevailed over the countless enemies he faced, as rather than saying it was due to his immense power and prowess as a warrior, Thor somewhat humbly said to Rocket that he believed he is only alive because fate wants it. His resentment for Thanos even made him about to attack Gamora when he learned she is Thanos' daughter, although he remains fully reasonable even with those connected to Thanos, as he went as far as to calmly talk about his own family problems with her. Having nothing more to lose, Thor valiantly and did everything he could to kill Thanos to avenge his people and family, with him going as far as to single-handedly bravely confront and wound Thanos with Stormbreaker, coming the closest to winning against Thanos. He even showed some sadism when he mocked Thanos that he had ignored Thor's promise to kill him and that caused him to be now seemingly beaten, having intentionally intended to wound Thanos first and gloat before killing him, but this proved to be a fatal mistake that Thor would deeply regret, as the blow was not sufficient to hinder Thanos, who successfully utilized the brief moment to activate the Infinity Gauntlet and wipe out half of the universe and escape, causing Thor to not only be mocked once again by Thanos, who remained calm even after being wounded but also fail to avenge his people and brother as well as losing more of his friends.

Following the Snap, Thor found himself riddled with guilt and fury in the knowledge that his fatal mistake had resulted in the destruction of half the universe's life forms. He retained a glimmer of hope, however, and immediately voted in favor of Carol Danvers' plan to claim the Infinity Stones and bring everyone back. During the confrontation, he actually seemed to have taken the Mad Titan's taunts to heart, immediately cutting off the Infinity Gauntlet to prevent him from utilizing it. However, upon discovering that Thanos had destroyed the Infinity Stones his wounds only deepen with shame and remorse and he kills the Mad Titan without hesitation shortly afterwards, finally avenging the death of his people. However, this brought Thor no semblance of peace at all.

Even five years after Thanos' death, Thor still continued to be haunted by his failure to stop the Titan and suffers in the belief that he had not been able to embody the qualities of an ideal king that had been imbued into him throughout his entire childhood. Still, he unsuccessfully tried to keep up a facade of still being his former self and initially refused to assist in the Time Heist. However, all this changed upon seeing his mother, Frigga, again, who told him he had indeed failed and that this made him just like anyone else; finally lifting the burden of having to be an ideal king from his shoulders.

Thus; Thor comes to terms with his own mistakes in the realization and acknowledgment that no individual is perfect, not even a king. During the Battle of Earth, Thor bravely faced Thanos alongside his fellow Avengers, displaying no signs of his previous anger towards the Titan. After the Battle, Thor seems to have returned to his former-self and decides to pursue a voyage of self-discovery. He also cedes the throne of New Asgard to Brunnhilde, having made peace with the fact he was not a leader.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Thor battles against the armies of Marauders
Asgardian Physiology: As an Asgardian, Thor possesses incredible supernatural powers and superhuman attributes far surpassing many other Asgardians, with only his father and older sister being his superior in power. With the death of Odin and Hela, Thor is currently the most powerful Asgardian within the Nine Realms and the cosmos. As Asgard's warrior prince, Thor trained in the arts of battle, which he has practiced for thousands of years. He is recognized as relying solely on his superior fighting ability, strength, and nigh-invulnerability. Following his banishment to Earth, Thor greatly withholds his power unless fighting someone with similar strength and durability. Due to his immense powers and disciplined perspective, Thor often has to hold back during a fight due to the destruction his strength may cause to his surroundings, such as his fight on the Helicarrier with Hulk, but even then he is still easily powerful enough to overpower multiple superhuman enemies and even overpower or at least contend with powerful beings such as Hulk and Loki. When he does let loose with his powers, Thor is capable of decimating much of his surroundings, such as when he shattered an entire ice shelf during a battle on Jotunheim, and defeating a powerful being empowered by an Infinity Stone, such as Malekith. After getting his full powers, Thor became powerful enough to contend with the true first-born of Odin and his older sister Hela. Odin implies that Thor has the potential to surpass him in the future. Wielding Stormbreaker, Thor is the only hero who made a successful attempt at severely wounding Thanos, with Thanos himself suggesting that if Thor hit him in the head with Stormbreaker he may have been able to kill him. However, despite the great capabilities Thor possesses, letting his condition neglected can extract a heavy toll on his power. This was evidenced when after 5 years of depression and an unhealthy lifestyle, Thor even using both Mjølnir and Stormbreaker at the same time, was still overpowered by an Infinity Stones deprived Thanos. Nevertheless, Thor did prove to be more of a challenge than most of the heroes who tried to face Thanos.
Superhuman Strength:     Thor moving the giant rings of Nidavellir   As an Asgardian, specifically the son of Odin, Thor is the third strongest Asgardian of his time, surpassed only by Odin and Hela, and with their deaths, he is now the strongest Asgardian alive. His incredible high-level of superhuman strength enables him to easily overpower hordes of Humans, Enhanced Humans, Asgardians, Frost Giants, Chitauri, Marauders, Dark Elves, Ultron Sentries, Outriders and various other species within or beyond the Nine Realms. He can lift or move immensely heavy objects effortlessly, such as when he was able to easily catch a falling car with one arm during Battle of Sokovia, saving the family trapped inside it, and flip a large, wide ceremonial table over on Asgard. He can also easily crush extremely durable objects, such as Iron Man's gauntlets. Thor's strength extends to his ability to leap great distances. With his strength, Thor is able to take on multiple enemies at the same time, using Mjølnir to send large groups of enemies, like the Frost Giants, the Chitauri, or Ultron Sentries flying with each strike. Using his weapon Mjølnir, Thor's strength is compounded, as he is able to swing his mighty hammer with great speed and force. Thor's strength is so great, that he can throw his hammer with enough force to break through nearly any barrier. Thor was also strong enough to overpower the Destroyer, which had overwhelmed the likes of Sif and the Warriors Three combined. Notably, he kicked Loki with enough force to shatter glass, lifted his brother off the ground and slammed him with enough force to stun him in their second duel. He also effortlessly overpowered Iron Man in his Mark VI despite it being empowered by Thor's electricity. His strength is so great that strikes with Mjølnir are usually fatal, knocking out opponents with one hit, and only beings of incredible power, like the Destroyer, Hulk, Malekith, Kurse, Ultron, Surtur, Hela, and Thanos can take multiple direct hits from Thor. Hence, Thor was able to shatter a massive Kronan Marauder, take down a Leviathan, and even break the Rainbow Bridge, all with only several blows of his hammer. Thor's immense strength combined with Mjølnir also enabled him to break out of an extremely durable confinement capsule which was specifically designed to hold the Hulk. Using his immense strength, Thor was able to block a crushing blow from Hulk with his own arm and even punch the latter in the face hard enough to make him stagger. Thor also managed to match Malekith, whose strength was greatly compounded by the Aether, equally and eventually overpower him. According to F.R.I.D.A.Y., Thor is able to "crack" the Vibranium core itself with his raw strength alone. He later managed to overpower a weakened Surtur, killing him with a fully-powered hammer blow to the head. During the Contest of Champions, Thor's strength and considerable fighting skill allowed him to dominate against Hulk, capable of staggering Hulk with his punches alone and sending him flying across the arena with a single hammer blow as well as even restraining him, only being overpowered by Hulk's growing anger and surprise attacks. After receiving visions from Odin's spirit, Thor's strength and fighting skill combined with his newfound ability to generate lightning allowed Thor to instantly topple and daze the angered Hulk with a single punch that visibly dazed him. When he fought Hela, although he was ultimately no match for the more powerful Goddess of Death, Thor's physical strength and skill still allowed him to put up a reasonable fight on his own against Hela, who had single-handedly killed the Valkyries, among the most powerful warriors of Asgard, managing to slightly stagger her with his punches and inflict minor injuries and briefly pressure her with Gungnir. Thor was also able to easily rip apart several Berserkers with his bare hands and contend with Hela during their final battle, managing to lift her off her feet and throw her to Valkyrie, fighting her to a prolonged standstill alongside Valkyrie. While attempting to restart the forge, Thor was able to easily swing around Rocket Raccoon's Benatar escape pod at great speeds, and physically holding against the force necessary to move the gigantic rings of Nidavellir, which encircled the neutron star. He also was able to hold open the iris of Nidavellir's star long enough for Eitri to melt ingots of metal that would become Stormbreaker, as well as throw the axe with enough force that, combined with his powers, it was able to slice through a beam from the completed Infinity Gauntlet, and lodge deep into Thanos' chest, as well as cause him great pain upon twisting the axe deeper. During the Battle of Wakanda, Thor overpowered an army of Outriders to save the lives of the Avengers and Wakandan soldiers as well as destroyed several Outriders' armored ships with relative ease. Even while weakened by having became fat, Thor's strength was still immense, as he was capable of grappling with the likes of Thanos for a brief period of time, as Thanos had to use both hands to overpower Thor's attempts to stop him from stabbing him with his own axe and he was able to hold long enough for Captain America to save him and with both Stormbreaker and Mjølnir in his hand when he attempted to decapitate Thanos again, he was gradually able to overpower the one-hand holding Mad Titan, coming very close to succeeding, eventually forcing Thanos to use both his hands and sudden momentum to knock him down. In addition to Thor's high-level strength, a full-power hammer throw aided by Stormbreaker was strong enough to knock out Iron Man in his strongest armor. Only a few beings were able to overpower Thor, including Hela, Surtur at full power, Odin, and Thanos.
Superhuman Durability:     Thor endures the energy of a neutron star   Thor's skin, muscle, and bone tissue have many times the density of the same tissue in the body of a human being, making him nigh-invulnerable, much more so than regular Asgardians to the point that Gamora claimed that Thor's muscles felt as if they were "made of Cotati metal fibers". Even when he was stripped of his powers, Thor was still amazingly resilient due to his dense body, withstanding being hit by a van with ease, and only being seemingly killed by a punch from the Destroyer. When he is at full power and armed with Mjølnir, Thor possesses nigh-invulnerability, including high resistance to powerful energy blasts, immense blunt force trauma, falls from great heights, explosions and various other opposing forces. He was unharmed and unaffected by the vacuum of space for indefinite periods of time unaided. Thor withstood high caliber bullets from the Quinjet that was flown by Ultron, who attempt on killing him during the fight at Sokovia without any injury. He withstood the extreme cold of Jotunheim, the extreme heat of Muspelheim, survived a direct near point-blank range blast from Gungnir blasting him out of Odin's chamber, and falling several hundred feet to the ground, showing no visible signs of injury. Thor easily withstood a four hundred percent-charged repulsor blast from Iron Man, was barely affected and completely uninjured by Quicksilver smashing into him at extreme speeds, took a mighty punch from Hulk with only a minor nosebleed, and even withstood the full force of the Destroyer's energy blasts with no visible injury. During his final battle with Malekith, Thor was even able to survive being hit by quite a few tendrils of the Aether Infinity Stone energy, and later a blast of Surtur's Twilight Sword flames without any permanent damage, though it should be noted that Thor had not been facing off against Surtur while the latter was at full power. Whenever he is injured, Thor's physique allows him to shrug off minor injuries such as small stab wounds from Asgardian blades or allows him to withstand a direct blow in the face from a massive Frost Giant and laugh afterwards. He resisted the direct destruction of the city of Novi Grad followed by a one-kilometer drop in the sea and was only momentarily unconscious. However, his durability would not prevent equally or even stronger foes like Hulk, Kurse, Ultron, weakened Surtur, Hela, or Thanos from wounding him. Nevertheless, Thor's own durability could still allow him to withstand their strength and power for quite some time before he starts to drop in power and be injured, as he withstood a severe beating from Kurse, Ultron, and Hela, notably surviving being stabbed with her Necroswords, which easily killed not only the Einherjar with a single hit but also the Warriors Three and the Valkyries, who had greater durability than low-tier Asgardian warriors, with no permanent damage, and managed to continue fighting afterwards, overpowered Surtur despite Surtur being at least equal, if not superior, to Thor in power, withstood a repeated tossing to the ground from Hulk during the Contest of Champions with no damage whereas Loki, despite his own extreme resilience, was completely wiped out from such an attack, and he was able to remain conscious upon being overpowered and pummelled by the angered Hulk long enough for him to experience a vision from Odin and turn the tides while sustaining no injury. After getting his full powers, Thor's durability grew much greater, with him thus shrugging off Hela's attacks and continuing to fight her with no deterioration in his performance and even managing to remain conscious after having been badly beaten by Thanos to an even greater degree than Hulk was, which still soundly knocked out the gamma beast, and even survived having his head squeezed by Thanos, whereas Loki was quickly killed by Thanos with less effort, once again proving he is significantly more durable and resilient than Loki, and soon be exposed to the vacuum of space, although all this combined caused him to pass out. Thor was also capable of surviving the full force of a re-ignited Nidavellir star for several minutes, though it left his body severely charred and rendered him unconscious, leaving him near-death. Thor's physical constitution is so strong he is able to survive exposure to the power of the Infinity Stones, as evidenced when he was able to quickly recover from being hit by the Reality Stone's powers whenever Malekith blasts it at him. He was also able to remain conscious after repeatedly being pressed by the force of the Power Stone against his head, however, at a less degree of the stone's full power whereas beings less powerful were instantly obliterate by the Stone, although he nevertheless suffered excruciating pain every time Thanos pressed it against him and prolonged exposure would likely eventually kill him, as Loki quickly submitted to Thanos' demands when he saw Thor being tortured by the Power Stone. Even while hampered by his poor lifestyle and subsequent weight gain, he was still far more durable than most of the other Avengers, as he was able to withstand getting pummeled by the 2014 Thanos' strongest attacks while remaining conscious, as well as enduring Thanos using Stormbreaker to nearly gut open his chest long enough for Captain America to save him with only minor bruises and bleeding scars.
Superhuman Speed: Thor can move at great superhuman speeds. Thor tackled Hulk through the wall of a Helicarrier in a split second, visibly appearing as a blur when they were battling in the hangar bay. He also proves capable of overwhelming Hulk in hand-to-hand combat during their second fight, able to easily dodge his feral attacks and land his own blows and get a grip on him. In battle, while holding back, he is easily fast enough to contend with the extremely fast Loki in combat and although his adopted brother is capable of outmaneuvring him when he is holding back, when Thor unleashed his rage, he was able to easily catch Loki off-guard, disarm him of his scepter and then brutally attack him without Loki being able to react in their second duel, implying that his speed exceeds Loki's. Moreover, Thor was so fast that he was still moving in Quicksilver's accelerated perception, while Captain America and Iron Man appeared as frozen in comparison. He could also contend with Hela, who had easily killed several Einherjar before they could react, for a time, able to briefly push her back when giving it all he got and land blows and react to her attacks after she recovered before being ultimately outpaced, and after unlocking his full powers, he was able to stay in combat with Hela to an even greater degree, showing no strain in moving fast enough to land glancing blows on her and even to surprise and lift her off the ground. Although he was easily kicked away soon after, Thor was able to surprise and land a hit on Thanos before he could kill Hulk. Even with his fat body diminishing his speed, he was still stupendously fast, as he was able to surprise the Mad Titan twice, first when he had just knocked down Captain America, catching him off-guard enough to disarm him and then in their last altercation when he was in a haste to retrieve the Infinity Gauntlet to briefly outmaneuver him enough to land a blow with his hammer and slash off his armor with his axe.
Superhuman Agility: Thor's agility, dexterity, balance, and bodily coordination make him a great warrior for battle. He moves with incredible grace and speed despite his considerable size and body density. He was able to dodge the wing of a jet fighter thrown at him by Hulk, as well as dodging many of Hulk's hammer and battle-ax blows and outmanoeuvring him in their second battle. He can easily keep up with Loki while holding back despite Loki's great agility in both their fights. While his five years of constant drinking and becoming fat did hamper his agility, he was still extremely agile, as he was able to dodge Thanos' sword when it was thrown at him and seamlessly attack Thanos enough to disarm him and quickly landed hits on Thanos immediately upon landing down to intercept him when he was off-guard in their last altercation.
Superhuman Stamina: Thor's advanced musculature is considerably more efficient than that of a human and most other Asgardians. As a result, his muscles produce far fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity compared to those of humans and most other members of his race. He was able to endure the vacuum of space while unconscious.
Superhuman Reflexes: Thor can react and dodge objects traveling at high speeds, with him dodging many of Hulk's blows during the Contest of Champions and he was able to blast away swords thrown by Hela as soon as they were sent flying towards him. He was also able to dodge intense Odinforce beams from the Destroyer and deflect them with his hammer. Thor was also capable of reacting to energy blasts from Loki's Scepter during their battle on Avengers Tower and energy blasts from Chitauri Guns, using his hammer to deflect them.
Regenerative Healing Factor: Despite his astounding resistance to injury, it is still possible to injure Thor. However, due to his Asgardian physiology, Thor is able to heal at a rate significantly faster than a normal human and even much faster than most Asgardians. After seemingly being killed by the Destroyer and proving himself worthy of Mjølnir once again, Thor regained his full power and immediately healed himself in seconds. Despite receiving mild to severe stab wounds from Asgardian blades on several occasions, after working past the initial pain of the injury, Thor was able to quickly recover and continue fighting. After the brutal beating he suffered from Kurse, upon arriving at Earth several minutes later, he had nearly completely recovered from his bleeding wounds. While fighting Hela, Thor was painfully pierced multiple times by her Necroswords, getting his right eye gouged out in the process, and while Thor was unable to regenerate his eye, he recovered from all of the stabs mere minutes later, despite the Warriors Three all perishing from a single stab from Hela each. After suffering a beating from Thanos and getting burned by the Power Stone, Thor managed to recover rapidly afterwards. Later, Thor survived the full force of a re-ignited Nidavellir star, though it left his body charred and near death, Thor was completely healed after receiving Stormbreaker to harness and amplify his supernatural powers.
Longevity: Thor, like all other Asgardians, is not truly immortal. It is possible to kill an Asgardian and other beings in the Nine Realms. More accurately, Asgardians are extremely long-lived beings. Thor ages at a pace far slower than a normal human. During his conversation with Rocket Raccoon, he claimed to be 1,500 years old.</p></html>
