<html><p>Fitz and Lance Hunter was able to track the truck to Enoch in his home. They snuck into the home with guns to surprise him, only to find that he knew they were coming.

Fitz furiously threatens Enoch's life
Enoch immediately showed them a video of Fitz's friends being sucked into a strange Monolith-like rock, and explained he sent them to the year 2091 to fulfill a prophecy, while also explaining who he was. After Enoch showed hesitance toward showing them the source of the prophecy, Fitz now getting annoyed, suddenly took Hunter's gun and forcefully threatened him, much to Hunter's surprise.

Fitz meets Polly and Robin Hinton
Later that day, Fitz and Hunter was taken by Enoch to a park, to meet Robin Hinton, an Inhuman who gained the ability to see through all of time. However, they quickly found that they were traced and followed by the officials who arrested Fitz, to which Enoch froze them in place. The five fled to the Lighthouse, a bunker built for an apocalyptic event, to hide for the time being.

Fitz learning about Enoch's capsule
Fitz and Hunter would find some down time, where they discussed Fitz's relationship with Jemma Simmons and Fitz's newfound dark personality from the Framework. Eventually, Robin would start to open up to Fitz, who required to save his friends in the future where they were sent, and Enoch finally agreed to help him get there, revealing a capsule that could take him there. However, he also revealed it's at Blue Raven Ridge, the facility where Fitz was held for 6 months.

Fitz breaks into Blue Raven Ridge
Fitz and Hunter would work together to break back into the facility, using false identities and ferrets as a distraction. They arrived at the facility saying that they were there to repair the damages from their the explosion, which Hunter had caused. Then released the ferrets to create a distraction, allowing them to break in. The two made their way into the storage room, where they searched for Enoch's capsule.

Fitz prepares to sleep for 74 years
They soon enough found the capsule, while also discovering the Zephyr One, which was also put into storage. After fighting their way through some guards, they escaped with both the capsule and the Zephyr. Back at the Lighthouse, they hid a box full of useful items to be waiting for Fitz once he gets to 2091. Fitz revealed the capsule is a cryo freeze chamber, and that he intends to freeze himself and wait 74 years to catch up with his friends. The capsule turned out to be a cryofreeze chamber that Fitz used to be put into stasis for seventy-four years after an emotional goodbye with Hunter.

Adventures in Space
Interrupted Journey
Fitz in cryo sleep during the attack on the ship
Some months into their mission, the vessel that Fitz was being protected in by Enoch was under attack. Fitz was still in stasis as Enoch apologized for the disruption in their plan, saying that he had to calculate the chances of survival, which appeared to be very low. The vessel then was cut in half.

Clandestine Journey
Fitz in disguise while onboard the Lazy Comet
As a result of the attack, Enoch prematurely awakened Fitz from his cryosleep and the pair escaped the Chronicom Vessel's destruction. However, as Enoch's Cryo-Freeze Chamber was destroyed, the duo began a journey to travel to a planet called Naro-Atzia in order to procure another Cryo-Freeze Chamber so that Fitz could resume his cryosleep. With no ship to travel the cosmos, Fitz and Enoch were forced to integrate into extraterrestrial societies and work their way to Naro-Atzia. A year later, Fitz and Enoch had boarded a Sivian cargo ship named the Lazy Comet, with Fitz working for the ship's leader, Viro, while Enoch hid away. Because Sivians were very xenophobic, Fitz acquired an Iriscope to change the appearance of his irises in order to pass himself off as Sivian, with Enoch teaching him the Sivian language.

Rescue of Sivian Engineers
Fitz getting exposed by the Sivian Foreman
On their way to Naro-Atzia, Fitz was cleaning out the pipes of the Lazy Comet with the ship's engineers before he accidentally exposed himself after voicing Xandarian Snails to be disgusting―when they are revealed to be a delicacy to the galaxy for providing joy, and when he tried to counter the question of where he was from by saying he was from the North, unbeknownst to Fitz, however, was an irradiated wasteland. The Sivian Foreman and the other engineers later cornered and exposed Fitz when they discovered his use of the Iriscope to change his eyes to look Sivian. The foreman then exposed Enoch, who was hiding behind the walls of the ship, much to Fitz's dismay. Viro, the Comet's owner, came to the bridge, seeing Fitz and Enoch as stowaway and orders their execution via airlock jettison into space.

Fitz trying to bribe Viro into letting them stay
As he and Enoch were taken to the airlock, Fitz boldly said that the Comet wouldn't survive the next re-entry it makes, causing Viro to halt their execution temporarily. Fitz then reveals that the heat shields of the ship are misaligned and further bribed Viro by saying he is more productive than the ship's crew because of how he handled and fixed multiple faults on the ship. Despite this, Viro reminded Fitz that he lied by saying it wasn't his first haul when really, he revealed to Fitz that he was running. Viro ordered his men to continue with the execution before Fitz says he and Enoch will work for free. Accepting this, Viro ordered the duo to fix the heat shields and the airlock to earn their keep.

Fitz and Enoch discuss a chance of survival
While repairing the ship as promised, Fitz brings up Enoch saying the ship was safe, but Enoch counters with it being more dangerous when Fitz revealed his identity and that Sivians are notoriously xenophobic, making Fitz frustrated that he didn't mention that before. Seeing how Fitz is not optimistic about their chances of survival, Enoch encouraged him by saying that they will soon return to cryofreeze and prepared to travel to the future safely, when all Fitz wants to do is to reunite with Jemma Simmons. Unbeknownst to them that the Earth had already been saved.

Fitz and Enoch talking to Viro about the crew
After completing the last of the repairs to the ship, Fitz and Enoch were taken to Viro on the bridge where he slurping down his drink. Fitz updates him, saying that the airlock is fixed and the shields are realigned. Viro, who initially pondered about what made them run to him but is satisfied with the work he and Enoch did. Despite this, Viro says the crew is lacking in the engineering expertise Fitz and Enoch have and plans to have them executed with the newly fixed airlock to jettison them from. Not wanting blood on his hands for a bribe, Fitz tried to convince Viro into letting them by training them to be more efficient like him, but Viro tells them to be thankful for letting them live.

Fitz and Enoch plan how to save their crew
As the engineering crew were being forcefully escorted to the Coment's airlock for execution, Fitz and Enoch watched from behind the pipes. Fitz says that the engineers were in that situation becomes of them, and it's up to them to save them. When Enoch says that there are very few chances where they succeed, Fitz counters by saying they can't just sit and watch them die, if he did, he would be unable to look Simmons in the eyes again if he let it happen, so the two came up with a plan that would save them and stop Viro.

Fitz attempts to stop Viro from killing the crew
As Viro was personally overseeing the engineers' execution, Fitz stood in his way wielding a wrench, causing Viro to confront him by saying he's not a fighter. Fitz agrees but adds that he could make him a lot more money if he let the engineers go. But Viro doesn't take the bait and allows his men to continue forcing the crew into the airlock. Knowing what was about to happen, Fitz gambled more by saying that Viro may not need them, but he needs Fitz himself. He then backs into the airlock. Viro questions him, asking if he thought of himself as a hero, but Fitz tells him that it was really about a woman, Jemma Simmons, and about looking her in the eyes again. When Viro shut the airlock door, the other airlock on Viro's side opened and Fitz watched as Viro and his men get sucked out into the cold vacuum of space. Enoch, who survived from being pulled into the vacuum, hit the switch and shut the airlock while opening up Fitz's, letting him and the engineering crew free and alive. After being thanked by the engineers, Enoch congratulated Fitz on his master plan, when he says it wasn't hard to predict, as he knows how hateful men thought.

Fitz making his change in their current plans
After succeeding in rescuing the engineers, Fitz looked out of the Comet's window and saw Naro-Atzia. When Enoch joined him, Fitz asked him if it is safe on the planet. Enoch admitted that it would be difficult to cover up Viro's death, with the engineers facing the death penalty for it. Although Enoch recommends an escape plan, he declines, saying that they went through the trouble of killing Viro to keep the engineers alive. Fitz asks Enoch where to take them to keep them safe, to which he recommends Kitson, a planet within their fuel distance. When Enoch brings up him going back into cryofreeze and joining his friends in the future, Fitz says he has time and set off for Kitson.

Making a Fortune on Kitson
Fitz unload the Xandarian Snails
After the pair dropped the Sivian engineers off in Kitson City, the two started to unload the Xandarian Snails to Boyle and Toad to pay for a Cryo-Freeze Chamber. When Boyle questioned where they were heading after this, Enoch bluntly told them their plan, much to Fit's annoyance. The scavengers didn't seem to care about it though, and got back to work unloading the snails. Fitz then listened as Toad talked about what a job they did saving the crew from Viro, even calling them heroes.

Fitz is given a chip for the House of Games
Fitz caught the eye of puffies, but was stopped before he could eat them, with Enoch explaining that they were not meant for humans. Fitz is assured that they would find food once they were paid, but were in shock when Boyle pointed a gun at them, demanding the snails and ship. Toad then showed them that the two were most wanted from his datapad. Taking pity on them, Boyle gave them a casino chip they can use at the House of Games and urged them to leave.

Fitz arriving at the House of Games
The two entered the House of Games, where they were greeted by an employee who informed to leave their weapons and robotic companions behind or they would be executed. Fitz tried to urge Enoch to remain, but Enoch already walked through the scanner undetected. He followed after him and questioned how he got through. When Enoch explained that his Chronicom biology allowed him to fool any scanner, Fitz simply nodded and claimed to be happy that Enoch made it while patting his shoulder.

Fitz is called "best friend" by Enoch
As the two walked down the stairs, Enoch talked about their year-long journey together has been "fun," much to Fitz's confusion. The two would continue down the stairs, Enoch then call Fitz his "best friend." He asked if Fitz felt the same, but he didn't provide an exact answer. Instead, he compared them to Xandarian snails, and how they're moving but not going anywhere. He then pulled out the casino chip and told Enoch that they needed more than the one chip they had before entering the main casino, with Enoch close behind.

Fitz and Enoch in the House of Games
When Fitz saw what kind of games and people were present, he became uncertain of their odds of succeeding in winning a fortune. Fitz is informed by Enoch that he was well-versed in over 10,000 intergalactic games of chance, some of which were being played in the casino they were in. Fitz asked which games he was good at, but Enoch revealed he was only an observer, not a participant. This gave Fitz little hope in seeing Jemma Simmons again and walked off.

Fitz calling Enoch his "best friend"
After meeting up with Enoch, the two tried to figure out which game to bet on. When Enoch suggest a drink, Fitz questioned why he did that. Enoch assured him that they delicious, but Fitz specified that it wasn't the taste, but the price; they only had one chip. Enoch realized their predicament, he grabbed the chip from Fitz and placed it on a gaming board. Before Fitz could stop him, the board lit up at that moment and they won a handful of chips because of it. Fitz pulled Enoch to the side and asked how he did that. Enoch began to explain how he deduced the odds, but Fitz cut him off, realizing he was an advanced computer. Enoch felt like that was an insult, but Fitz assured him it wasn't and convinced him to use his advanced thinking to their advantage by calling him his best friend.

Fitz telling Enoch not to greet the brigands
Fitz and Enoch were soon given their drinks and Fitz denied it while Enoch enjoyed his. Fitz deduced that the table behind them was where the most money was being won. Enoch was eager to join their ranks, but Fitz told him it depended on his poker face. Fitz accompanied Enoch to the board, where he greeted the brigands, much to Fitz's confusion. Fitz watched, as Enoch made great progress in winning a fortune.

Fitz witnessing Enoch losing all the money
Fitz tried to stop Enoch from betting, believing it was a trap. But Enoch disagreed and informed him that he thinks he found a "like-minded friend" to join their adventure. Fitz, however, didn't believe Wayne was a friend, much to Enoch's disappointment. In the end, Wayne won much to Fitz's annoyance. Enoch then questioned if Wayne lied to him, to which he openly acknowledged. This left Enoch in a daze as to him being manipulated.

Fitz and Enoch figuring out what to do
The two sat at the bar in despair with Fitz dumbfounded that Enoch lost all their money. Enoch defended himself, saying Wayne intentionally deceived him. Fitz called it bluffing and compared it to what Enoch does. Enoch, however, saw no comparison, but Fitz reminded him that he was a robot passing as human, which was bluffing. Fitz is asked by Enoch that was he bluffing when he referred to him as his best friend. Fitz believed it didn't matter anymore and didn't answer. Enoch recommended they go to the brothels of Kitson to earn some money, however, Fitz, refused to take part in the brothels.

Fitz is betted on by Enoch
Enoch suggested a game that didn't require bluffing, but based entirely on mathematical odds. Fitz asked him why he didn't suggest this before and Enoch told him it was because it was very high stakes. Fitz is brought to where the game would be played where he was examined by Montalban. Fitz is told by Enoch that he is worth a high price, which led Fitz to realize he was the collateral. Fitz is informed that if Enoch losses, he would be sold into slavery. Now terrified, Fitz tried to get Enoch to take his place, but Enoch informed him that he has to count the tiles. Fitz is told that Enoch would give him a signal him using a high-pitched tone that only human ears could hear. Fitz took a seat and Enoch told him not to get a fourteen without further explanation.

Captured by Chronicoms
Fitz reactivating Enoch
As the game progressed, Fitz was aided by Enoch's high-pitch tone. Though it looked as though they were winning, Enoch automatically shutdown. He was discovered by Montalban, who ordered everyone but Fitz to leave. Montalban locked them in and Fitz was finally able to turn Enoch back on. Enoch felt uncomfortable and urged Fitz to cease. Fitz told him that he set off a "air-raid alarm." Enoch, however, realized that he was remotely shut down and told him that it was a Chronicom Hunter that caused the shutdown and that they were on their way.

Fitz learning about the Chronicom Hunters
Fitz tried to find a way to escape before they could skin them, but Enoch didn't care if they had his skin, referring to it as his uniform of shame. Fitz tried to convince Enoch that he wasn't useless and to help him. When Fitz questioned what the horrible smell was, Enoch claimed it as the foul stench of the name Enoch. Fitz was instead referring to the dead gamer and Enoch informed him he was a Crepetolian whose blood was made up of 75% sulfur. He proceeded to bang his head on the table.

Fitz telling Enoch that he is his best friends
While Enoch was moping, Fitz started to spread the Crepetolian's blood across the door and asked Enoch to "spark up". Enoch questioned why he would do that when there was no purpose, saying the both of them would soon be dust and rust. To make Enoch feel better, Fitz called him his best friend and that was his purpose. Enoch believed he was bluffing, which Fitz assured him he wasn't; that during the time he's known him, he's grown on him. This gave Enoch the purpose he needed and told Fitz he would do anything for his best friend.

Fitz is captured by Malachi
Fitz watched as Enoch sparked his fingers to ignite the sulfur, to knock down the door. The spark blew the door open. Fitz made his way out of the room to find Jemma Simmons. Fitz became surprised to see her, thinking that she was in the future. But before they could properly reunite, the Chronicom Hunter Malachi appeared and grabbed Fitz, quickly teleporting the two of them away.

Fitz is threatened by Malachi
Fitz was teleported onto Confederate Destroyer Ship, where he was taken hostage by Malachi. Atarah revealed Fitz being held at gunpoint by Malachi to convince S.H.I.E.L.D. to help them travel through time. When Simmons went to hug him, she went through him, revealing that it was a hologram. Fitz was then hit by Malachi, causing Quake to threaten to destroy the ship, which Atarah revealed that he was not on the ship, being aware of her power. When Enoch tried to stop Atarah from hurting Fitz, she would grow tired of their refusal, and ordered Fitz to be executed by Malachi on her command. Before Malachi could kill Fitz, Simmons revealed that they used a machine that controlled the Monolith that allowed them to travel through time.

Fitz is gassed by Enoch
Fitz was visited by Enoch, who gave him a brief on the situation. Fitz was informed of Simmons' capture, when he asked to fill in the blanks. Enoch reluctantly told Fitz that he offered Simmons up so that the two of them could be spared. Fitz, however, was furious at Enoch for what he did and ordered him to leave his cell. Enoch pulled out a small device and told Fitz he would always be his friend before releasing gas into the cell, causing Fitz to fall unconscious.

Unstoppable
Long Awaited Reunion
Fitz and Jemma Simmons finally reunite
Fitz was put in a state of unconsciousness, as he and Jemma Simmons was taken to the Cerebral Fusion Machine that allowed them to be put in a mental confine where they would share the same mind. When the machine was activated, Fitz awoke, a looked over and see's Simmons and the two hugged, finally reuniting with one another after a year of being separated. They talked about what they had been doing to get to one another, Fitz is told that they truly was sent forward in time. Suddenly, Atarah appeared and Fitz is informed by Simmons that the Chronicoms had been hunting them for the last year. Fitz is also informed who Atarah is and about the destruction of their home planet Chronyca-2.

Fitz and Jemma Simmons in the Cerebral Fusion Machine
When she revealed her intention to reverse the destruction, Fitz realized she was referring to time travel, which he voiced was against the laws of physics, which Atarah told Fitz that Simmons claimed it to be possible, having done it before. She then told them to begin working on finding a way to achieve time travel, informing them that they had access to any tool imaginable and that their minds and memories were shared within the machine. This would cause concern for Simmons for their memories being shared, but Atarah would inform them that it was necessary in order to achieve their goal. Atarah then warned them that there is no escape and that they should only be concerned on working on how to help them, and once that would be completed, they would be free.

Fitz proposes to Jemma Simmons
Atarah then suddenly exited, leaving the two to be alone, and Fitz is given the chance to speak with Simmons. He held her hands and began to reflect on their relationship, noting everything they had overcome, including surviving the bottom of the ocean and crossing over the galaxy to find one another, making him to then believe that they are stronger than any curse, and they could not be stopped. Fitz then proposed to Simmons, which she said yes to, and the two passionately kissed. They then hugged, and Simmons tells Fitz that she doesn't care if they ever escaped as long if they have each other. They then sat down, creating a spread of tea and sweets, and discussed their journey's to find each other and the planets they went to. Fitz then asked if she encountered any Kree, and she tells him that they did.

Dealing with Child Simmons
Fitz creates a Time Di'Alla
Fitz continued to take more about the future, trying to understand what had happened when they traveled through time. He then created a Time Di'Alla and began to express some theories on how they could understand time travel. However, Simmons didn't want to go into too much detail about her experiences with the future, as she didn't want to let him know about his death. Fitz still interested in what happened in the future, would annoy Simmons that she would turn into a seven year old version of herself, which would shock Fitz. Fitz would follow the seven year old Simmons, under a bench and through a doorway that lead to her childhood bedroom.

Fitz reads a book to Jemma Simmons
Fitz confused on what's happening, asked the young Simmons if she knew who he was, which she did, which led him to ask why she came to her room, which was revealed that she would work out her problems by putting them in her music box, Fitz went to inspect the box, but was stopped by Simmons when she asked him to read to her. When Fitz tried to get her out of the room, Simmons yelled out to her parents, forcing him to comply with the request. When Fitz began reading the box, which was about Simmons' journey to find him, he discovered that it was the Darkhold, causing him to throw away the book.

Fitz argues with Jemma Simmons
Fitz then grabbed Simmons and brought her back to the space they were working in. When they entered, they saw Atarah standing in front of them, who Fitz questioned for putting them in a mind prison. Fitz interjected when Simmons tells Atarah that she does like her, Fitz, who was getting frustrated with Simmons, made her hand over the chemicals. The two began to argue until Fitz started to mention creating Aida to help him, which made Simmons return to her normal age, as Fitz planned.

Learning about the Alternate Fitz
Fitz seeing his own dead body
As the two argued due to the built up frustration of being trapped in the machine, Fitz asked Jemma Simmons what she was so afraid of, which causes Simmons to conjurer a tragic memory with Alphonso Mackenzie appearing. The two then visited Simmons' memory, despite Simmons' warning not wanting Fitz to see it. Fitz observed as the other agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. discussed someone who had died, whose death Simmons had difficulty processing. Noticing the body bag, Fitz approached it and zipped it open, only to see that it had his own dead body inside it. Fitz wondered how this was possible, and Simmons explained that the existence of two Fitz's was due to time travel.

Fitz learning the truth
Upon hearing this, Fitz realized that the body he was looking at was that of another Leo Fitz, one who had successfully remained in cryosleep for 74 years and had awakened in 2091 to save his friends before making the trip back to 2017 with them. Simmons informed him that the other Fitz aided them in preventing the Destruction of Earth, and had sacrificed his life in the process. While struggling to process this, Fitz then witnessed Daisy Johnson hand Simmons a wedding ring, and Fitz uttered in horror that he had missed his own wedding. Simmons corrected him that he did not miss it since she had married the other Fitz, but the news caused Fitz to become overwhelmed. As Simmons tried to comfort him, Fitz noticed a weak Phil Coulson stumble into the room and overheard Johnson and Melinda May discussing his ailing health. Fitz then asked Simmons what their words meant, and Simmons tearfully explained that Coulson had been sick and had passed away, prompting Fitz to leave the room immediately, informing Simmons that despite everything he had just learned, Coulson's death was too much for him to accept.

Personality
Like Jemma Simmons, Leo Fitz is known to be an attractive nerd on his profile for S.H.I.E.L.D., though he is somewhat socially awkward. Fitz also has a strange affinity for monkeys. He also has a great sense of humor, teasing Ward behind his back (in a mockery Southern accent), and planning to prank Skye. He is also a good actor, and easily impersonates an American tourist.

In spite of his lack of combat skills, Fitz impressed the more experienced Ward with his remarkable bravery and quick thinking during their mission together in South Ossetia. Fitz believes deeply in the friendships he creates: being upset when Skye appears to have been secretly working with Miles Lydon, actually crying when John Garrett revealed himself as HYDRA, as well as having a rare angry fit and emotional breakdown when Ward was revealed to be a murderer and a HYDRA mole. In return, Fitz is very loyal to his friends, is miserable when he was unable to save Skye from Quinn, and trusts Simmons with his life. Another instance of his loyalty was his refusal to serve Gonzales, deciding to leave rather than betray Coulson.

While Fitz is devastated at Ward's betrayal, he is the only one on the team that still insists that Ward is redeemable, as Fitz believes that people are never "born evil." He is the only one who still tries to reason with Ward and implores him to let Garrett die and abandon HYDRA. Despite that, Fitz later on became very bitter against Ward after he dropped him and Simmons into the ocean to die and for betraying the team, even going on to torture him by suffocating him inside a cell as he did him, and later, attack him. However, Fitz is also very forgiving and understanding of others' problems, shown when he quickly forgives Skye for being so secretive about Miles Lydon, claiming that everyone "makes mistakes." He also instantly forgives Coulson for knocking him out with a punch, understanding the situation. As Simmons grows closer to Triplett, Fitz remains suspicious of him, though he does learn to trust him later on.

The brain damage Fitz suffered has caused him to become withdrawn after Simmons opted to be a part of an undercover mission. Fitz had hallucinations of Simmons and talked to her, claiming that those conversations calmed him. Billy Koenig had replaced him in many aspects, raising Fitz's jealousy. No one other than Skye and May interacted with him until Alphonso Mackenzie approached him, creating a new friendship between the two.

Since nearly losing Simmons to the Kree Monolith, Fitz has exhibited a tougher and more determined personality. His actions often put himself directly in harm's way, in order to protect those he loves. In order to find a way to get Simmons back, Fitz traveled to Morocco and negotiated with terrorists, risking his own life for a piece of parchment with the secret of the Monolith written on it. Once he returned to the Playground, he found out that the only word on the parchment is "Death". In his desperation, Fitz blasted the Monolith's container open with a shotgun and started beating on the rock furiously demanding that it swallow him.

Whilst inside the Framework, Fitz's personality was radically different to the point where he was the polar opposite from who he was in the real world. Ruthless, cruel, cold and sadistic and claiming to enjoy torturing people who HYDRA would capture. "The Doctor", as he was nicknamed, was willing to use his intelligence and scientific ability to further promote HYDRA's ideals, developing an agonizing experiment to find out an Inhuman's powers without triggering Terrigenesis. According to Fitz, victims of this experiment never survived, yet The Doctor had no qualms about carrying it out. This radical change was achieved when Aida removed Fitz's greatest regret, which was never having made amends with his father. In the Framework, Fitz's personality was deeply influenced by the education provided by his cold and ruthless father, who in turn was proud of his son's achievements within HYDRA. However, Fitz still had doubts about doing the things he was doing like the killing of Agnes Kitsworth, even if his father dismissed these doubts as ""womanly sentiment". After escaping the Framework, Fitz was horrified by his behavior inside the alternate reality since it had led to the deaths of Kitsworth and Jeffrey Mace, and was afraid that his profound nature could be evil. Fitz was so wracked with guilt that he was unable to look at Simmons once he was out of the Framework without breaking down into tears. He also offered to sacrifice himself for the team by taking full responsibility for what had happened since the creation of Aida and the Framework. Moreover, being responsible for Mace's and Kitsworth's deaths was such a trauma to Fitz that he was unwilling to kill Aida and thus causing him to have another death on his mind, even if Aida had become a crazed, lethal enemy to S.H.I.E.L.D. Instead, Fitz tried to stop her by attempting to reason her and to have her express her pain by means other than violence, but his attempts failed as Aida was keen on making him suffer.

Despite his expressed guilt and shame toward his actions in the Framework, minor traits of his alternate dark personality stayed with him, with an example being when Fitz forcefully threatened Enoch by holding him at direct gunpoint. Fitz initially rejected these remnants, stating that he could not accept it and was trying to bury it within him. However, after his friend Lance Hunter told him that all he had to do was do his best to control it.

Above all of this, Fitz is genuinely a good person who desire to help others, no matter who or what they are, as long as he don't hold some significant hatred toward them. Even after Grant Ward was, by all the facts, an HYDRA agent and traitor, Fitz refused to believe in that until he saw him, and even when Ward chased him and Simmons he continued believe in the relationship between them, and yelled to him, keep trying to make Ward to do the right thing. Even when it comes to his enemies, which threaten his and his friend life, he can be very compassion, as shown when he keep try and justify Ward, or make Aida back from her rampage, or tried to save his fellow workers at Viro's spaceship at the cost of his own life, despite the latter are those who revealed and uncovered his true identity as earthling at first place.

Abilities
Genius-Level Intellect: Fitz has become a very well known agent in the S.H.I.E.L.D. tech community for his technological expertise. Grant Ward's attempt to kill him damaged his temporal lobe, and he temporarily displayed aphasia as a result, a difficulty remembering or explaining words. However, this condition did not affect his intelligence, and Fitz continued being a genius. Over time, Fitz recovered from his brain troubles until he was released from the Framework and his intelligence was used by The Doctor, Fitz's evil self, to devise clever but harsh plans Fitz's true self was unwilling to come by.
Master Engineer: Fitz has designed and created many of the equipment commonly used by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, including the Night-Night Guns and I.C.E.R.s, the Mouse Hole, the Magic Window. He has also created many of the tools used for analysis and scientific work, especially the D.W.A.R.F.s, the Golden Retrievers, the Full-Spectrum Goggles or the Magic Window. The sensitive nature of many mission has made him to develop devices against the clock that needed to be adapted to the parameters of each mission. As such, John Garrett was willing to recruit Fitz into HYDRA to benefit from his engineering abilities. Fitz's expertise also extends to artifacts of Asgardian origin, as his previous experience with the Berserker Staff allowed him to fully repair Lorelei's Asgardian Collar, greatly impressing Sif who considered him "quite clever". Fitz's intelligence was so great that he developed a quantum bridge to traverse the Quantum Realm without the need of Pym Particles in the war against the Chronicoms.
Fitz fights against Hive possessing Will Daniels
Skilled Combatant: When Fitz first joined Coulson's Team, he was not a capable fighter. However, through his years of training with the team after joining, he became an adept combatant, as he fought against members of the Watchdogs using hand-to-hand combat. Fitz was also able to hold his own against Hive possessing Will Daniels' body briefly before being subdued, due to the creature's strength and further experience. He later was able to fight against a Primitive with great skill.
Fitz shoots Holden Radcliffe's LMD in the head
Expert Marksman: Fitz was taught how to handle a handgun as per his S.H.I.E.L.D. training, when he refused to accept Simmons' apparent death, he accurately shot off the locks of the case containing the Monolith with a shotgun. He later resorted to use them to repeatedly shot Hive while possessing Will Daniels' body on Maveth, or to kill Giyera using a Cloaked Gun. Fitz greatly improved his marksmanship abilities after his time in the Framework, as shown when he and Lance Hunter reclaimed Zephyr One. Before this, he possessed enough accuracy to shoot Holden Radcliffe's LMD in the head.
Skilled Spy: Fitz was able to convincingly pass himself off as a Sivian for months while in space, successfully blending in among extraterrestrial lifeforms.
Multilingualism: Fitz is able to speak some Arabic and to read Hebrew, aside from his native Scottish-dialect English. He spoke Arabic when he confronted gangsters in Morocco to get to Yusef Hadad. When Fitz opened the scroll casing he had taken from him, he was instantly able to identify the symbol on the scroll as the Hebrew word for "death". However, he did not know that the word also had the meaning "death by punishment". In deep space, Enoch taught Fitz to speak the Sivian language.
Equipment
Weapons
Fitz dual-wields a pair of I.C.E.R.s
I.C.E.R.s: The I.C.E.R.s are upgraded versions of the Night-Night Gun technology developed by Fitz and Jemma Simmons. One of the times that Fitz used it was during the fight at Blue Raven Ridge where he and Lance Hunter found Zephyr One.
SIG Sauer P226: The SIG Sauer P226 pistol is the standard sidearm carried by S.H.I.E.L.D. Tactical Agents. Fitz grabbed one of these weapons from one of the HYDRA operatives infiltrated into S.H.I.E.L.D. and used it to kill another before he could kill Melinda May during the Battle at the Hub.
Smith & Wesson M&P: The Smith & Wesson M&P pistol is the standard sidearm carried by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Fitz was issued one when he was on the run from the S.H.I.E.L.D. faction led by Robert Gonzales, together with Phil Coulson and Lance Hunter.
Smith & Wesson M&P Compact: Fitz grabbed the compact version of the Smith & Wesson M&P standard pistol inside Castillo San Cristóbal in Puerto Rico to threaten Alphonso Mackenzie, who had been possessed by the Kree City and attacked his teammates to protect the city.
Glock 17: Fitz obtained this handgun from a backpack carried by one of the HYDRA operatives that took him to Maveth. He used it when he discovered that Will Daniels had died, and Hive had possessed his corpse. Despite Fitz shot him many times, the Inhuman managed to survive all the shots. He also borrowed the gun from an agent guarding the door of the room where Holden Radcliffe was being held once he realized that Radcliffe had actually replaced himself with an LMD. Fitz shot it in the forehead, revealing its true nature. Fitz took another of these handguns from Trevor Khan's corpse when he was killed by the Chronicom Hunters in order to defend himself as he had heard someone approach, though it was actually Agent Diaz and another group of surviving agents.
FN Five-seveN USG: Fitz grabbed a gun from one of his men when they traveled to Ogygia to interrogate Holden Radcliffe, and only to prove Radcliffe wrong about him, he killed Agnes Kitsworth in cold blood. He grabbed another gun from a soldier to threaten Jemma Simmons due to she having killed his father Alistair, and was only prevented from doing so by Radcliffe himself.
Heckler & Koch MP5K-PDW: Fitz attempted to use one of these submachine guns against Giyera when he managed to escape containment inside Zephyr One and began to took over the plane. However, before he could shoot at him, Giyera easily took the weapon out of Fitz's hands.
Fitz shooting at the Monolith with a shotgun
Mossberg 500 Cruiser: Fitz took a Mossberg 500 Cruiser from the arsenal in the Playground to break into the sealed room where the Monolith was being kept, in a desperate attempt to understand what happened to Jemma Simmons when she was swallowed up by the artifact.
Olin Flare Gun: Fitz shot a flare with this gun towards the portal to Maveth when it was activated inside the HYDRA Castle. Jemma Simmons saw the flare, and went towards the flare, managing to return to Earth but leaving Will Daniels behind.
Orion Flare Gun: Fitz obtained this handgun from the backpack carried by one of the HYDRA operatives that took him to Maveth. He used it against Will Daniels' corpse, who had possessed by Hive, as shots with a Glock 17 pistol proved to be harmless. The flare made Daniels' corpse to burn, leading Fitz he had killed the creature.
Night-Night Pistol: Leo Fitz designed the pistol version of the Night-Night Gun for his teammates, but he also began to carry two of them during his field missions with the rest of his team. Fitz used it to repeatedly shot at the already unconscious member of the Cybertek security team that attacked Jemma Simmons in a train in Italy, leaving the gun with an unconscious Simmons to protect herself once she woke up.
Overkill Device: Fitz modified the Overkill Device he was sent to deactivate in South Ossetia, and used it as a handheld weapon to disarm the separatists that were about to attack him and Grant Ward.
Fitz fires the Destroyer Armor Prototype Gun
Destroyer Armor Prototype Gun: Under Phil Coulson's explicit orders, Fitz procured and fired the Prototype Gun against Vin-Tak, a Kree who was fighting Bobbi Morse when he tried to kidnap Skye due to her status as an Inhuman.
Cloaked Gun: Fitz used this gun to kill Giyera.
Chronicom Rifle: To be added
Other Equipment
D.W.A.R.F.s: Fitz often used the D.W.A.R.F.s in order to analyze and retrieve forensic data during his field missions, such as in the Centipede laboratory in Los Angeles, the temple where an 0-8-4 was located in Peru, the StatiCorp facility in Utah and even the Kree City under Puerto Rico. He also used them to try to stop criminals Vanchat and Marcus Daniels.
Localized EMP Device: Fitz retrieved a Localized EMP Device from the Hub and carried it during his dangerous mission to South Ossetia, using it to force a blackout and gain a local mob's trust by fixing it.
MAG Pouch: Fitz carried a MAG Pouch during his dangerous mission to South Ossetia, using it to adhere to the underside of a track and enter a separatist compound with Grant Ward.
Magic Window: Fitz carried a Magic Window during his dangerous mission to South Ossetia, using it to see through the walls of the separatist compound.
Spectrographic Analyzer: Fitz resorted to the use of an Spectographic Analyzer to determine the origin of each and every piece of debris found after the Battle of Greenwich.
Golden Retrievers: Fitz has used his Golden Retrievers in order to track individuals over a relatively great distance, such as tracking Tobias Ford in Utah or Deathlok in Florida.
Tracker: Fitz intended to use a Tracker on the package that Cybertek was delivering to Ian Quinn, but he ended up using it to inform the rest of his team about his and Skye's location in Ian Quinn's Villa.
Mouse Hole: A device created by Fitz that was not mass-produced, but kept by S.H.I.E.L.D.'s highest agents, such as Nick Fury and Maria Hill. He kept one for himself, and used it to cut a hole through the Bus and infiltrate the Hub.
Cigarette Laser: Fitz tried to demonstrate that the items of the Howling Commando Gear were more than they appeared, and started to pretend he was smoking the Cigarette Lasers. However, the only thing he managed to do was to set the drapes on fire.
Quarter Walkie-Talkie: Fitz and Antoine Triplett shared a pair of Quarter Walkie-Talkies as they investigated John Garrett's headquarters in Cuba, leaving it in the Bus and allowing the rest of his team know that the plane had returned to the United States of America.
EMP Joy Buzzer: Fitz used the device against John Garrett, damaging his cybernetic prosthesis and bringing him to the brink of death.
Forensics Scanner: A forensics device used in the investigation of the man that battled Lady Sif in Portugal.
Three Dimensional Scanner: Fitz used Three Dimensional Scanner to analyze the remains of a wall that Lash had disintegrated in order to escape from Lori and Shane Henson's apartment.
Backscatter Glasses: Fitz used the Backscatter Glasses during the mission to find Holden Radcliffe.
Iriscope: Fitz used this device to change his irides to resemble the appearance of Sivians while working onboard the Lazy Comet.

Facilities
S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy of Science and Technology: Fitz spent several years training at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy of Science and Technology, where he was quickly noticed as one of the best students. This is also where Fitz met Jemma Simmons, who would become his best friend, and later his wife. Once his training at the Academy was completed, Fitz was asked by Simmons to accept to join Coulson's Team.
Providence: During the HYDRA Uprising, Fitz, along with the rest of Coulson's Team, sought refuge at Nick Fury's secret base known as Providence, where he remained for several days until the team was forced to flee as the base was taken over by the United States Armed Forces.
Playground: As a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, Fitz was based at the new facility called the Playground to replace the lost Triskelion. Fitz spent a lot of time in the Playground, and especially in the labs, slowly recovering from his brain injury after nearly drowning in the ocean. Fitz was mostly present in the labs, where he designed new tools for S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to use and analyzed various artifacts. Fitz briefly left the Playground during the S.H.I.E.L.D. Civil War, refusing to serve under Robert Gonzales, but returned when the two S.H.I.E.L.D. factions were merged. He also shared a room with his girlfriend Jemma Simmons in the Playground, although the couple had started to look for a place outside the Playground to move in, a project which never came to fruition before the destruction of the base.
Lighthouse: While looking for his missing friends, Fitz was taken to the Lighthouse by Enoch along with Lance Hunter.
Prisons
HYDRA Castle: Having been kidnapped by Giyera, Fitz was held prisoner at the HYDRA Castle along with Jemma Simmons by Grant Ward.
Blue Raven Ridge: Fitz was detained for six months in Blue Raven Ridge by General Hale, who hunted down the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who had gone missing. During his time at Blue Raven Ridge, Fitz was frequently interrogated by Lieutenants Evans and Lucas, but to no avail. Hale threatened to lock him up forever, but Fitz was eventually able to escape from the facility thanks to Lance Hunter who posed as his attorney.
In the Framework
S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy: Like in his real life, Fitz attended classes at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy, where he met Aida in a similar fashion to Jemma Simmons in the real world.
Triskelion: As a high-ranking officer of HYDRA, Fitz, known as The Doctor in the Framework, spent most of his time at the Triskelion, HYDRA's main base of operations. Like his real-life self, he was mostly present in the labs, where he designed equipment to torture and study captured Inhumans and was put in charge of the Project Looking Glass.
