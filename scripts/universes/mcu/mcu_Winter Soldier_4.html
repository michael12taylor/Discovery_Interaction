<html><p>Enhanced Stamina: Winter Soldier's musculature produces far fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human, allowing him to exert himself at peak capacity for hours before tiring. Hence, he could endure the Clash of the Avengers and the later showdown at the HYDRA Research Base without showing signs of fatigue. Barnes, alongside Sam Wilson, was able to participate in the Ambush at Latvian GRC Resettlement Camp against the Flag Smashers, then go on to fight John Walker, all of whom had also been enhanced by the Super Soldier Serum, and by the end of it was still strong enough to walk away from the fight.
Enhanced Reflexes:     Winter Soldier catches a knife in mid-air   Winter Soldier's reflexes are enhanced. His reflexes are responsive enough to catch Captain America's shield being thrown at him at a high velocity. He was also able to catch enemy grenades thrown at him, as well as projectiles such as knives and poles, dodge fire from Falcon's Steyr SPPs, and leap on top of a moving car accelerating towards him with pinpoint accuracy. His reflexes are also fast enough to dodge or block Captain America's shield attacks and Black Panther's slashing attacks with hooked and clawed fists. It also helps him to catch objects that are hurled towards him. He was able to catch a knife thrown at him as well as catch a metal pole thrown at him by Karli Morgenthau with deadly force.

Regenerative Healing Factor: Winter Soldier's body is able to heal with extraordinary speed and efficiency, at a rate well beyond that of a regular human being, however he is unable to regenerate missing limbs. This may be one of the factors of his survival from the Swiss Alps. His healing has also allowed him to quickly recover from injuries received in battle; the injuries he had received during combat with Iron Man healed in a matter of days without bruising or scarring. In the span of a single day he was able to fully recover from the vicious wounds he suffered from fighting John Walker with ease without any lasting bruises or scars.
Longevity: As a result of the Super Soldier Serum, Barnes ages at a much slower rate than the normal human, a trait he shares with fellow super soldiers Steve Rogers and Isaiah Bradley. Barnes' lifespan has also  been artificially extended by being frozen in a Cryostasis Chamber; allowing HYDRA to weaponize him for many generations by keeping him frozen between his missions. He is currently over 100 years old, but retains the appearance of an adult man at his prime.
Bionic Arm: Barnes lost his left arm and had it replaced with a cybernetic one by HYDRA. After his original arm was destroyed, Barnes received a new vibranium arm from T'Challa.
Superhuman Strength:     Winter Soldier robustly hitting a concrete road   The bionic arm gives him extraordinary superhuman strength, superior to that of Captain America's strength, though not quite on par with that of Spider-Man. Winter Soldier was able to rip open a S.H.I.E.L.D armored SUV, rip apart Falcon's EXO-7 suit, and smash concrete by punching it. With his bionic arm supporting his already enhanced natural strength, the Winter Soldier was shown to be able to overpower Captain America in a fight. More evident for this was during the fight at Escape from the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre, Barnes used his bionic arm to successfully overpower Captain America, who used both of his hands while attempting on stopping Barnes with extreme effort. However, his bionic arm's strength has its limitations as it was shown to be outclassed by Black Panther, Josef, Spider-Man and later Iron Man Suits like the Mark XLVI.
Superhuman Durability: Winter Soldier's cybernetic arm is incredibly resistant to physical damage and most likely made of titanium. The cybernetic arm is shown to be bulletproof, made evident when Barnes used the arm to block several gunshots from a German officer. However, it did have its limitations, as one shot of Iron Man's Unibeam cut right through it. After losing his original cybernetic arm, Barnes was given a new vibranium one by Black Panther. This new arm grants him even higher durability due to it being composed of vibranium, as well as the benefit of being vibration absorbent, though of course it can be deactivated by Wakandans that know how to exploit the metal alloy.

Abilities
Barnes fighting Captain America
Master Martial Artist: Winter Soldier is an incredibly skilled and exceedingly formidable master hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist, excelling at improvisation and weapons handling, employing mixed martial arts that include elements of systema, karate, boxing, muay Thai, Krav Maga, and kali, making him one of the most dangerous and best fighters on the planet. Originally, Barnes was a three-time YMCA welterweight boxing champion. Later, as the first Winter Soldier, Barnes received vast training from HYDRA, as well as the United States Armed Forces. Combined with his enhanced physical abilities, Barnes became an extremely dangerous master assassin who can slaughter dozens of enemies alone, take on and even overpower highly skilled martial artists such as Black Widow and Falcon with relative ease, be in charge of training the other Winter Soldiers, and easily beating and locking them away when they went berserk, and go toe-to-toe with the likes of Captain America and Black Panther. In the Battle of Washington, D.C., the two engaged in a brutal one-on-one fight, both matching each other with every move, though Rogers was ultimately able to defeat him in their second duel, he later beat Rogers after being released by Helmut Zemo, catching him off guard. While under Winter Soldier programming Barnes effortlessly beat Falcon, an expert trained combatant, by grabbing his face and throwing him to the prison cell, knocking him out during the second encounter. Barnes also single-handedly killed up to a dozen well-armed Quinjet pilots in a single encounter, and escaped uninjured. Barnes easily overpowered a suitless Tony Stark, Sharon Carter, and Black Widow, all in rapid succession and fought evenly with Black Panther. Barnes also held his own repeatedly against T'Challa, even when he wears his Panther Habit, Barnes was able to competitively push him back and restrain him. Although Barnes was briefly outmatched by Iron Man in Mark XLVII Armor, he was able to hold off Iron Man's attempts to kill him, almost defeated him alongside Rogers, and later on he managed to beat him to submission. He has display noticeably superior fighting prowess over super soldiers Flag Smashers and even the U.S. veteran John Walker who was chosen to be the next Captain America. Barnes was able to easily overpower the also super soldiers Flag Smashers with his combat training, quickly delivering blows that pummeled them into submission. In Chase of the Flag Smashers, he managed to resist them while caught off guard over their physical prowess at first but later able to defeat two before being knocked down the truck. With knowledge of their physical prowess which gained from the previous battle, Barnes easily defeated two Flag Smashers in the Ambush at Latvian GRC Resettlement Camp, even handling a knife using Flag Smasher without using the knife he was given until the end. He also easily fended off Ayo's spear assaults while trying not to harm her and she was only able to end the fight due to using her knowledge of how to disarm his Vibranium arm, which he had absolutely no knowledge of. When he fought the highly decorated veteran of the U.S Army John Walker who was chosen to be the next Captain America and after he too had taken the Super Soldier Serum, his fighting prowess combined with his own superhuman abilities allowed him to directly contend with him even as Walker was using his shield whereas Falcon was outmatched even with his technology, disarming him of his pistol, briefly taking the initiative and countering his attacks with the shield and ultimately landing several blows on Walker and holding his attempts to hit him in the chest with the shield at bay before Falcon disarmed him, proceeding to easily overpower and man-handle Walker for Falcon to deal the finishing blow to once he was disarmed of his shield. During the Flag Smashers final assault on the GRC, he completely dominated a Flag Smasher to where Morgenthau saw the need to cause a distraction, with Barnes still kicking him down even after being hit, and managed to easily overpower Karli Morgenthau to where he simply dodged her attacks and punched her and Dovich down without much effort even when they were armed, whereas Walker had visibly greater trouble fighting Morgenthau and the Flag Smashers in the battle. Barnes has also proven to be a great mentor, as he trained Wilson in shield throwing and hand-to-hand combat to prepare him to finally become the next Captain America, improving his combat skill to a point where he was able to defeat Georges Batroc even though he lost to him before.
Barnes wielding a Flag Smasher's knife
Knife Mastery: Winter Soldier is extremely skilled and excels in knife fighting with an emphasis in Kali knife fighting. The Winter Soldier usually resorts to his combat knife in close quarters combat, as seen during his duel with Rogers on the streets of Washington, D.C. He usually holds the knife in his natural hand and uses his bionic arm for support should he need more force to overpower an opponent, using a downward stab or tossing it between hands to advance his assault, making use of swift and skillful jabs, stabs, and slashes at the enemy's vital points. During his hotel assassination mission as the Winter Soldier, he easily killed enemies with a single knife move and has also shown to be highly skilled at knife throwing, easily hitting his targets with excellent accuracy. Barnes was able to use a knife effectively against Rogers, nearly scoring hits on him during their first fight and impaling him in their second fight. Barnes also used a bayonet knife with a great effect against the Outriders, he was able to kill an Outrider without much difficulties, quickly delivering several lethal stabs and slashes to its neck and vital points. He also easily managed to overwhelm and get a knife point on a knife-wielding Flag Smasher upon having pummeled them.
Shield Mastery: Barnes is highly proficient in throwing his fallen friend's iconic shield. He managed to disarm Rogers of his shield during their duel on the highway, and later threw it to knock him down during their rematch on a helicarrier. He and his friend used the shield against Stark with great synergy, and he also practiced ricocheting the shield with Wilson.
Staff Proficiency: Barnes is proficient in using a staff. During the Escape from the JCTC, he was able to disarm an agent and use his baton to subdue several agents simultaneously with ease. During the ambush at the shipyard, he was able to use a pole to knock out a bounty hunter and then throw it into another bounty hunters' shoulder with great accuracy.
Winter Soldier aims at Black Widow
Master Marksman: Barnes is highly proficient in handling firearms with remarkable precision, even prior to being turned into the Winter Soldier. During World War II, he shot a HYDRA operative that even Captain America did not see until he was down. His marksmanship was deemed invaluable to the Howling Commandos destruction of HYDRA's bases and the thwarting of the Nazi troops. As the Winter Soldier, he became an even deadlier master marksman. He accurately fired a single round through Black Widow's stomach and into a nuclear scientist that she was protecting, killing him. Winter Soldier is also capable of making long-range shots without the use of a rifle, for example, shooting Nick Fury multiple times through the wall of Steve Rogers' apartment and from the top of another building. Barnes has also proven to be highly skilled with pistols as well, being able to accurately fire at Rogers while fighting him in close combat, even managing to land a single shot on Rogers and thus push him into defensive, and later even manage to land two shots on Rogers with one bullet went through his stomach when he was stopping Project Insight from initiate. As the Winter Soldier, Barnes has caught and handled Captain America's Shield on two occasions and showed impressive ability in doing so. He was also able to use his gun to swiftly take out many Outriders during the Battle of Wakanda. He even attempted to shoot Thanos to prevent him from extracting the Mind Stone out of Vision, only to be subdued by Thanos, who blasted him into the bushes with the Power Stone. Barnes later on easily shot multiple mercenaries hired by the Power Broker with a pistol.
Master Acrobat: Due to his extraordinarily enhanced agility and reflexes, Winter Soldier has shown immense capability in using flips to evade fire such as when he flipped to cover when he was being shot at by Falcon's Steyr SPPs. He could also maintain the balance of a moving motorcycle he was utilizing while engaged in a fight with Black Panther.
Master Assassin: Winter Soldier is an incredibly skilled master assassin. Ever since he's been brainwashed, Winter Soldier has lived in complete anonymity with most of the intelligence community not even believing he exists. He's been credited with over two dozen of HYDRA's most crucial assassinations in the last 50 years, including John F. Kennedy and Howard and Maria Stark. He was even able to shoot Nick Fury while himself outside of Rogers' apartment, and shoot through Black Widow to take out his target.
Gifted Intellect: Barnes is considerably intelligent ever since youth, being a model student back in high school. After enlisting into the military, he received training in military tactics and leadership, and has proven to be an accomplished strategist and leader, earning the title of Sergeant. He was able to command an entire unit during the World War I and serve as Rogers second in command among the Howling Commandos. He also displayed good acting skills, being able to successfully pretend to be the Winter Soldier in Madripoor without raising any suspicion and his action even made Wilson worried.
Expert Tactician: Barnes has been trained in military tactics and has spent decades as a soldier and covert operative, using quick thinking and resourcefulness to execute his assignments. As the Winter Soldier, his strategical aptitude was only enhanced even further with training to be HYDRA's most covert operative, having been able to successfully come up with flawless plans that allowed him to both execute his victims while leaving no traces behind. After escaping Hydra’s control he managed to stay off the grid for two years despite the active search of Sam Wilson and Steve Rogers, with an already formulated escape plan with a burn bag ready should he be found. Barnes quickly formulated a plan with Zemo to assist the criminal in his escape from the Berlin Correctional Facility and noted that the most vulnerable portion of any security system was the staff members.
Expert Pilot: Winter Soldier was able to hijack a Quinjet after killing the pilot. He also effortlessly flew a helicopter in Berlin.
Multilingualism: Barnes fluently speaks his native English, as well as fluent Romanian and Russian. His time in Wakanda allowed him to speak and understand Xhosa. He also fluently understands German and Japanese.
Equipment
World War II Weapons
Colt M1911A1: Barnes was issued an M1911A1 as his sidearm during World War II. He carried it after joining Captain America and the Howling Commandos in a series of attacks across Europe.

Winter Soldier equips himself a firearm
Colt M4A1 with a M203 Grenade Launcher: A fully automatic carbine and the standard weapon used by S.H.I.E.L.D. Strike Team members, outfitted with a grenade launcher. The Winter Soldier was handed one of them by one of the mercenaries that accompanied him on the streets of Washington, D.C. while trying to kill Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff, using both the grenade launcher and the assault rifle against them.

Barrett M82A1M: A heavy rifle that the Winter Soldier used as a sniper rifle during an assassination. He was captured in a photograph released by the press, but his image was so blurry and small that it needed technological enhancements to be distinguished.
Barnes and Rocket firing their guns
M249 SAW Paratrooper: Barnes obtained this machine gun from Black Widow's equipment locker inside the Quinjet and took it to infiltrate the HYDRA Siberian Facility with Steve Rogers. However, he was unable to use it, as Tony Stark disarmed him as soon as he engaged Barnes and Rogers. Barnes was given another one in order to prepare for the upcoming Battle of Wakanda. He used it to attack the first waves of Outriders that managed to cross the barriers, and to continue fighting when they all directly confronted them. Once Rocket Raccoon arrived, he held him on one arm while aiming with the other, shooting their weapons and sparking Rocket's interest in both the weapon and Barnes' Prosthetic Arm. Once Barnes was snapped out of existence, the weapon was left behind. He took another of these machine guns in order to join the Avengers and the rest of their allies in the final battle against Thanos and his armies, shooting at multiple enemies during the battle.
FN Mk 13: A grenade launcher customized to fire Disc Grenades. The Winter Soldier used it against Nick Fury's SUV, in an assassination attempt against Fury.
Milkor MGL: A six-shot revolver-type grenade launcher, that the Winter Soldier used on the streets of Washington, D.C. against Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff. His first shot sent Rogers to the street down a highway, and he kept using it to destroy the cars that Romanoff used for cover until she also fell to the street.
Disc Grenade: During the assassination attempt on Nick Fury, the Winter Soldier used a disc grenade to disable Nick Fury's SUV.
M67 Grenade: The Winter Soldier caught a grenade thrown against him by one of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents protecting the pilots at the Triskelion, and quickly threw it inside a Quinjet to destroy it.
Ball Grenade: The Winter Soldier rolled a heavily-customized variant of the "Ручная Граната Наступательная (Ruchnaya Granata Nastupatel'naya)," a Soviet hand grenade, underneath a car towards what he thought was Natasha Romanoff, but was in reality just her phone. The Winter Soldier later used another grenade to destroy the roof of a tunnel while being chased by Black Panther and the GSG 9, hoping to trap his attackers and get away.
Battering Ram: During a fight with GSG 9, Barnes took a battering ram from them and briefly used it to fight against the agents before discarding it on his way out of the building.
Other Equipment
Bionic Arm: HYDRA created a titanium bionic arm to replace Barnes' lost arm, which he lost after falling from the train. As the Soviet Union was involved in the Winter Soldier Program, Barnes' titanium arm was marked with the Soviet red star. During the battle at the HYDRA Siberian Facility, Barnes' arm was destroyed by Iron Man when he tried to rip the arc reactor out of the suit. T'Challa gave Barnes a new one built by Shuri before the battle of Wakanda; the new arm functioned similarly to HYDRA's one, but with enhancements stemming from the use of vibranium.
Captain America's Shield:      Winter Soldier holds Captain America's Shield   Barnes had wielded Captain America's Shield on a few occasions. During the Capture of Arnim Zola Barnes briefly used the shield while trying to kill a HYDRA soldier but was unsuccessful. During the attack on Nick Fury, Barnes shot Fury and was chased by Captain America across rooftops. Captain America caught up to him on a rooftop and threw his shield at him. However, Barnes caught his shield with his bionic arm and threw it back at him, allowing Barnes to escape. During the battle of Washington, D.C., Captain America and Barnes fought again and during that fight, Barnes managed to steal the shield and briefly used it against Captain America. During the battle at the Triskelion Barnes briefly used the shield against Captain America by throwing it at him. During the Battle at the HYDRA Siberian Facility, Captain America and Barnes fought Iron Man, as the fight continued, Barnes used the shield against Iron Man alongside Captain America.
Winter Soldier holds Captain America's Shield
Uniform: HYDRA designed a lightweight tactical suit for the Winter Soldier, complete with a half-face mask in an attempt to conceal his true identity from the world. The uniform is constructed from Nomex thread and Kevlar fiber. The lightweight suit provided resistance to small arms fire and had advanced flexibility for close-quarters combat. In addition, he also sometimes wore bulletproof tinted goggles to further conceal his face and for eye protection.
Grapple Device: A line cable firing device that automatically entangles a limb of flying or fleeing culprit, thus preventing their escape. Winter Soldier used this cable to pull Falcon out of the air by his wing.
Winter Soldier's mind being wiped clean again
Memory Suppressing Machine: When Barnes was captured by HYDRA, his mind was then wiped which removed any memories of his time fighting in World War II and his friendship with Captain America. Before his upcoming missions, the Winter Soldier would have his mind wiped once again, to ensure that he remained an empty vessel of a man who would obey HYDRA's orders without question. Following his brief encounter with Rogers, the Winter Soldier began questioning his past, leading to Alexander Pierce ordering that the Winter Soldier be put back into the machine and have his mind wiped yet again.
Cryostasis Chamber: During his time as an assassin for HYDRA, Barnes was placed in a cryostasis chamber to be kept under control. HYDRA would only unfreeze him when they had a mission ready. That way, he could last for decades, and not succumb to age and become wasted. As soon as the mission was over, HYDRA would return him to this chamber. After finding asylum in Wakanda, Barnes voluntarily allowed himself to be placed in cryostasis until Wakandan scientists could find a way to reverse his brainwashing.
Bucky Barnes' List:  Once Barnes had recovered from his brainwashing, he made a list of names in a notebook that Rogers had given him, featuring people who he felt he still had business with. These names were of people he had wronged as the Winter Soldier, including Yori Nakajima, whose son he had murdered, as well as people such as L. Atwood, who he knew was still conducting criminal activities, and Barnes felt he needed to stop. Barnes was incredibly protective over this list, as he threatened to kill Helmut Zemo for merely looking at it.

Facilities
HYDRA Siberian Facility: As an assassin for HYDRA, the Winter Soldier would report back to his HYDRA superiors in Siberia after he completed an assassination mission for the terrorist group. He would then be put under deep sleep under the Cryostasis Chamber to ensure that he would remain loyal towards HYDRA and emotionless towards those he killed. In 1991, Barnes was kept at the Siberian compound, the main headquarters of the Winter Soldier Program. After he assassinated Howard and Maria Stark and obtained all the Super Soldier Serum, five additional HYDRA assassins were chosen for candidates for the program. However, the soldiers instigated sedition against their HYDRA superiors, and they were eventually put under suspended animations. After, the Winter Soldier was relocared from the Siberian facility to the Ideal Federal Savings Bank in the United States of America.
Ideal Federal Savings Bank: As a HYDRA facility located in Washington, D.C., the Winter Soldier was taken care of by HYDRA by repairing his prosthetic arm, which was damaged by Captain America and Black Widow. When the Winter Soldier started to experience flashbacks of his fall from the train in the Alps, Alexander Pierce ordered to wipe his memory with painful electroshocks before going on his next assignment.
Bucky Barnes' Apartment: After remaining in hiding once S.H.I.E.L.D. had collapsed, Barnes hid inside a small apartment in Bucharest, but once Captain America had infiltrated his home, he decided to leave the apartment once he realized that the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre had ambushed it.
Wakanda Medical Center: Now needing his mind to be fixed, Barnes traveled to Wakanda with Steve Rogers, undergoing cryostasis at the Wakanda Medical Center until his HYDRA's programming could be completely removed. Once Barnes was cured of his programming, he would no longer receive any treatment from the medical center.
Barnes Residence: Following him being restored to life, Barnes got an apartment in Brooklyn, where he lived alone and met neighbors, who he talked to frequently.
Izzy: While living in Brooklyn, Barnes would go to the restaurant frequently for lunch with his neighbor Yori Nakajima, and one night go on a date with the waitress Leah there.

Trivia
In the comics, James Buchanan Barnes, named after the 15th President of the United States of America, James Buchanan, had a complicated romantic relationship with Black Widow, and took over the mantle of Captain America after Steve Rogers was assassinated by Crossbones.
In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Barnes occasionally uses Captain America's Shield, a reference to his role as Captain America's successor in the comics.

While living in Wakanda, Barnes was given the nickname White Wolf. This was the codename of Hunter, a foreigner adopted by T'Chaka who became an anti-hero and the head of the Hatut Zeraze.
Although his bionic arm is his left arm, Barnes is right-handed.
