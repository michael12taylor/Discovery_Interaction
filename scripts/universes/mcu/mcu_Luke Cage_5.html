<html><p>As they waited until morning, Cage and Jones shared about their pasts and their respective problem with their fathers. Eventually, Cage decided the best course of action is to take Jones to the police. He called Knight to update her about the situation. Unbeknownst to Cage, several Stylers had entered the building and captured Jones. When he was alerted by Jones' cry for help, Cage fought all the Stylers and managed to rescue Piranha.

Knowing he had no other options, Cage brought Piranha to the church and ask his father for help. He asked Lucas to keep watch over Piranha while he goes out to confront Bushmaster. Having snatched a phone from one of the Stylers, Cage called Bushmaster. He challenged him for a fair fight which agreed that if Cage wins, Bushmaster must leave Harlem and Jones. Bushmaster agreed to the challenge.

Duel at High Bridge
Meeting at High Bridge at High Noon, Cage met Bushmaster. Before fighting, Cage and Bushmaster conversed about their respective goals. Bushmaster wanted revenge against Mariah Dillard due to past grudges. and Cage had vowed to stop criminals like Bushmaster. Cage refused Bushmaster's offer for an alliance given his crimes. When the time for talk was over, both opponents immediately began fighting at High Bridge.

Cage fighting Bushmaster at the High Bridge
At first, Bushmaster's superior fighting skills gave him an advantage as his opponent repeatedly land blows on Cage. However, Cage's bulletproof skin, adapting to his opponent's fighting style and landing solid hits on his own, gradually allowed Cage to turn the tide against his opponent. As Bushmaster gets exhausted and injured over the course of the fight, Cage's victory seemed assured.

However, Bushmaster blew poisoned powder at Cage which instantly paralyzed him. Unable to move and at Bushmaster's mercy, his opponent gave his respect to Cage and sincerely wished that circumstances were different. Once that was said, Bushmaster kicked Cage off the bridge and into the river below.

Cage and Knight
Cage asking his father where's Piranha
As Cage continued to sink under the water, he saw flashes of his life. He saw his mother and his deceased wife Reva Connors. When he saw a memory of his father, Cage woke up from his unconsciousness and his paralysis gone. Immediately heading to the surface, Cage managed to make his way back to the church before passing out. An hour later, he was told by Lucas that Piranha headed out. Despite Lucas' plead, Cage headed out to continue his work.

Cage and Knight looking for Piranha
Back at the barbershop, Cage joined up with Knight. They both headed out to search for Piranha. They headed out to Irie Taxi Co. to confront the Stylers. Cage and Knight fought the gangs stationed there and managed to learn Piranha's location. Heading toward the address that they have been given, Cage and Knight found the decapitated head of Jones in a fish tank. They called the police about the situation but they were asked to leave the crime scene.

Rescue of Mariah Dillard
Taking Piranha Jones' past advice about talking to his father to heart, Cage headed back to the church to talk to his father. Cage told his father about his near-death experience in the river and about seeing his mother. He reminisced about the last time he saw his mother and his father at Seagate Penitentiary. He remembered how, despite his mother's illness, she still came to visit him and believed in him. Cage told his father about his belief that his life flashes must be a sign from God that the world may be his problem but it wasn't always his fault.

Both father and son continued their talk, Lucas admitted that he was wrong for blaming Etta's death on him and profoundly apologized to Cage. Before their conversation could continue, they were interrupted by Dave Griffith who came to warn Cage about the fire at Mariah Dillard's Brownstone.

After rescuing Dillard, Cage brought her and Johnson to the precinct for their own protection. While in the precinct, despite Cage's attempts, Dillard refused to share what she knew about Bushmaster. When Knight arrived with the rest of the police, she informed Cage about Ridenhour's murder which she blamed Dillard for.

Cage and Knight discuss Comanche's death
While staying in the precinct, Cage had a brief talk with Johnson and just like her mother, she refused to share what she knows about Bushmaster. While looking at photos of the crime scene, Cage recognized the other found body as Comanche. He shared this information with Knight who deduced that Comanche must have been Ridenhour's snitch. With her work keeping her busy, Knight asked for Cage's assistance to talk to Johnson about Bushmaster while she focused on Ridenhour's murder.

Cage began talking to Johnson and she told Cage what she knew about Bushmaster's vendetta against her family. Before Cage could learn more, the arrival of Dillard stopped his talk. Dillard remained uncooperative and she kept taunting Cage much to his annoyance and anger. Cage watched as Benjamin Donovan left Dillard's service when he learned about the loss of her wealth. Despite Cage's grievance, he stated that he will protect Dillard until Harlem is safe. While following Dillard out of the precinct, he saved her from an attack by the Stylers. He learned from one of the Stylers that Bushmaster has put out bounties on Dillard, Johnson and Cage himself which also included his loved ones.

Warning his Father

Arriving at the Mount Olivet Baptist Church, Cage had pleaded with his father to come with him to a safe place, but Lucas still refused to leave the church when he has a sermon. Lucas told his son that he would have to stay inside of the church to protect him, which Cage reluctantly agreed to. Later during the day as Lucas held his sermon, Cage listened while also keeping watch. Cage's suspicion proved correct when the Stylers had attacked and attempted to kill Lucas.

During a private talk to Knight, Cage told her that their options were limited and they needed to take down Bushmaster before he does more harm to Harlem. Knight then headed off back to the 29th Precinct Police Station, while Cage remained to keep watch over their charges.

Father and Son Time

Not long after, the Stylers led by Bushmaster arrived at the Rand Enterprises Research Facility. While they hid, Bushmaster loudly informed Cage that he only wanted Dillard and he was willing to allow Cage and the rest of his allies to leave. While tempted by the offer, Cage decided to face Bushmaster and protect Dillard.

As the Stylers attacked the facility, Cage fought Bushmaster outside the facility. After disposing of his men, Cage entered another fight against his adversary.

The elder Lucas warned his son not to let his calling become a curse that corrupts him. His father admitted that he has never been more proud of his son and affirmed that he loves him.

Griffith was surprised that he fought Bruce Lee, however, Rand quickly corrected him by saying it was a real dragon but was interrupted by Cage.

Cage and Danny Rand spend time meditating
Cage insisted if Rand will stay and help him, he'll must play by his rules. Rand politely told Cage that he'll do just that with no problem as he likes to put up a good fight. After Rand put up a handshake, the two Defenders agreed to work together. Through meditation, Rand and Cage focused on the idea to take down Bushmaster by using silence. Cage wondered if it would have solved the problem. Rand told Cage that while he might be invulnerable, Bushmaster doesn't seem to have the same level of endurance as Cage and thus he must have been injured and seek out for medical aid.

Cage and Danny Rand have a talk in Harlem
Cage has the idea to get to place where the Bushmaster has been getting Nightshade for his strength. Rand agreed with his idea and they proceeded to move out of the barber shop and into their target's current location.

Rand explains that it all has to do with staying still, Cage only excepts that the only thing he does is getting things done.

Discovering Nightshade
Cage and Danny Rand finding the ingredients
Agreeing with Danny Rand's theory and knowing that their adversary must have sought someone unregistered, Cage brought him to Mother's Touch. When they arrived at the building, they found it wrecked and Tilda Johnson missing. Rand looked over the place and began discussing about the Chronic 2001, his favorite song, while Cage wondered why was that his favorite, to which expressed that he downloaded it while boarding on the Rand Enterprises Private Jet. Rand looked over to a poster to which reminded him of the teachings of self balance from the mind of the person. As they searched for clues, Rand theorized that since Bushmaster's powers come from Nightshade, he must be addicted to it. The two teammates concluded that Bushmaster must have sought for a way to keep growing more nightshades in order to maintain his powers and addiction. They both headed to Harlem's Paradise to search for Johnson's whereabouts.

Questioning Mariah Dillard
Cage and Rand enter Harlem's Paradise
Cage and Danny Rand then arrived at Harlem's Paradise in order to personally question Mariah Dillard. While Rand was slightly worried about Dillard's goons, Cage had assured that they would not dare to harm him due to his status as a billionaire from Rand Enterprises. Although Rand had argued that he no longer has kind of cash lying around him anymore and only resorted in his business, Cage had told him that it did not matter as long as he had money, it only gets him respect and not just power. As they looked around, Cage noticed that Sugar was working for the Stokes Crime Family again, with Sugar noting that this was due to his car getting damaged by Cage. Dillard and Shades then entered the room and looked both of them down, as Dillard wondered why Cage decided to come back to Harlem's Paradise, while Cage questioned Dillard about Tilda Johnson, and found no answer. Dillard then noticed Rand and offered him a drink, although Rand rejected her offer. Cage proceeded to insist that if Dillard saw Johnson, she better care for her. During their talk, Rand noticed Cage's lack of focus and once they headed out, he suggested a place to visit.

Cage is tested by Danny Rand about his focus
Rand jumped in front of him and told him that he does in fact have the time to do this. They had a brief spar and Rand proved his point when Cage's anger made him unfocused and keeping his perspective narrowed. Rand expresses that in order to focus on the job in hand, he must stand still and try to find a perfect plan to figure out in the most logical way. They needed to find someone who knows what was happening in the streets, someone who was a rat. Knowing the right person to talk to, Cage and Rand searched for Turk Barrett.

Questioning Turk Barrett

After some difficulty finding him, Cage and Danny Rand eventually managed to locate Turk Barrett at his Pot Shop. Rand had let Cage confront Turk about how he has gotten into any criminal activities to which he replied that he had not been in for awhile. Barrett noticed Rand and introduced himself, however, Barrett already knows about him since Madame Gao's men was reportedly scared off from Barrett's business. Cage wonders if he notices any new drug that has ever been seen, but Barrett decided not to tell him. Rand notices a dragon pipe that is used to smoke marijuana and expresses that he likes it. Cage asked if he smoke, but Turk interrupts him with asking about the certain drug he's talking about.

Cage proceeded to tell him where it is and broke his products. Barrett confesses that a certain activities are happening at an abandon warehouse near Rucker Park. Rand and Cage headed to the warehouse, Barrett angrily told that Cage if he could pay for damages for the broken bong, Cage replied to bill him.

As Bushmaster's men arrived at the warehouse in a van and brought out the supplies for the plant they were about to make. Cage and Iron Fist looked over the men at a distance. Iron Fist proceeded to ask Cage about being calm and focused but Cage replied that he is already focused.

As the noises stop, Iron Fist uses his Chi to punch open the steel door and enter the warehouse ready to fight alongside with Cage.

Cage and Iron Fist found heavy resistance amongst the group of men and proceeded to take them down and splitting up.

Iron Fist left the dying plant on soil it on and said that they should move and made the call for investigation. Cage and Iron Fist finished their task by burning down the building and the plants.

Rand then asked for more food and asks for more mu shu pork, Lin then proceeded with the order.

Rand proposed the idea of being a hero is follow the sirens instead of running away from them to which Cage replied that maybe the sirens are different from what he is looking for.

Rand admitted that Claire Temple was asked to look after Cage. Cage asked why did she call Rand and he replied by making him sure that doesn't get too angry and how she is worried about him.

Stopping Mariah's Reign
A Temporary Truce
Cage at the aftermath of Gwen's massacre
Not long after hanging out with Danny Rand, Cage was informed of the massacre that took place in Gwen's. Heading to the scene, Cage looked upon the victims and regretted that he saved Mariah Dillard, now using her maiden name, from burning to death. As he stayed at the crime scene, Cage noticed a blood trail. He and Misty Knight deduced that there must be a survivor of the massacre. Returning back to the precinct, Cage and Knight identified the survivor as Ingrid Mackintosh. Knight advised Cage to search information from the three other crime families first.

Cage interrogating some criminals
After violently interrogating all three crime families, Cage learned that they did not have anything to do with the massacre. Cage began searching for Mackintosh. Eventually, he managed to locate her at one of the clinics. After dealing with Tony and Ricky who were trying to find her, Cage talked to Mackintosh and convinced her to follow him. As they attempted to leave, Cage briefly lost sight of Mackintosh but managed to find her unharmed after she was spared by Shades. Despite Cage's plead, he was unable to convince Mackintosh to tell the New York City Police Department about what happened as she did not want to relieve the massacre. Sympathizing with her plight, he agreed to protect her. While protecting her, Cage learned more of Bushmaster's history.

Cage talking with Bushmaster
Cage managed to bring Mackintosh to the morgue where her husband Anansi was located. They found John McIver already there. Mackintosh prevented any hostility from sparking and urged them to talk while she mourned for her husband. McIver expressed his gratitude to Cage for protecting his aunt. Cage urged McIver to walk away but he refused. Cage warned McIver that if he goes after Dillard, he will be there which McIver didn't doubt. Before leaving to comfort his aunt, McIver mused that they could have been friends and he voiced that he did not look forward to another conflict with Cage.

Cage is joined by Sugar
As Cage left the morgue to head back home, he was followed by Sugar. He informed Cage that he no longer worked for Stokes and they needed to get the situation under control. He further told Cage that Harlem did not need a sheriff anymore, it needed a king. Cage agreed to the idea and Sugar joined Cage.

Setting the Stage
Not long after, trouble happened in Harlem when drugs became a problem again. Cage was informed Aisha Axton about the latest accident with drugs. Axton informed Cage that the drugs were named after Bushmaster. Having experienced a similar situation in the past, Cage believed that Mariah Dillard must be involved with the drugs. Through his connections, Sugar informed Cage that Dillard was in league with the Yangsi Gonshi. Cage asked him to find out where the Yangsi Gonshi stored the drugs.

Cage and Bushmaster fight the Yangsi Gonshi
Guided by the location from Sugar, Cage headed toward the warehouse where the Yangsi Gonshi stored their drugs. Once he arrived, he found Bushmaster confronting Hai-Qing Yang. With their goals aligned for once, both Cage and Bushmaster joined forces as they confronted the Yangsi Gonshi. As they fought through multiple attackers, Cage made sure that his temporary ally did not kill any of them. Once their opponents have been defeated, their temporary alliance quickly deteriorated when Cage was forced to prevent Bushmaster from destroying the warehouse with his Hammer Industries Explosive Charges. After dealing with the Yangsi Gonshi, Cage headed to Harlem's Paradise to confront Dillard about the drugs.

Cage sitting down quietly next to Columbia
Returning back to the barbershop and regroup with his allies, Cage learned that Dillard had planned for a concert to happen in Harlem's Paradise. Cage deduced that Dillard intentionally planned the concern to bait Bushmaster to attack, forcing Cage to protect her in order to make sure no people got hurt in the crossfire. Cage expressed his exhaustion about his work to his allies and the constant dilemma he is forced to deal with when it comes to Black Mariah.

As the night drew closer to the concert, Cage headed to Harlem's Paradise to protect Dillard and face Bushmaster again.

Battle at Harlem's Paradise
Cage returning into Harlem's Paradise
Arriving at Harlem's Paradise, Cage found the place filled with people just like Mariah Dillard planned. Cage intermingled with the crowd as he watched out for Bushmaster. He briefly caught eyes with Dillard who taunted him for coming to her aid. Cage spotted Misty Knight in the club. He was informed that Shades has given up Dillard.

Cage fights Bushmaster in Harlem's Paradise
Not long after, Bushmaster arrived at the club and began attacking Dillard's guards. Immediately, Cage went off to face him. Managing to catch up to him, Cage fought against Bushmaster once again. Unfortunately, this time, Cage found his opponent to be a far more dangerous foe when he managed to make Cage bleed after a few hits. Despite assistance from Knight, they both found themselves outmatched by Bushmaster. Their fight brought them to the office and Cage found himself outmatched by his enemy's sudden increase in strength. After getting pushed off the office window, Cage recovered and regrouped with Knight before pursuing their opponent.

Cage being finally able to defeat Bushmaster
Cage and Knight managed to reach Bushmaster in Stokes' basement shelter. Another intense fight ensued as Cage, assisted by Knight and Shades, battled against Bushmaster. The fight proved difficult as Cage and his allies were constantly forced down or knocked down by Bushmaster. Eventually, Cage managed to find an opening and began landing punches on Bushmaster's head which knocked him down. Even then, Cage was forced to attempt a sleeper hold on his opponent to bring him down. Despite suffering internal injuries by the repeating hits from Bushmaster during his attempt to break free, Cage endured and kept holding him. 

Cage and Knight watch as Dillard is arrested
Dillard urged Cage to kill Bushmaster. Despite the temptation, Knight managed to convince Cage not to go through with it.

Although their opponent escaped, Shades managed to snatch the Stokes' Revolver that proved evident of Dillard's crimes. Cage watched as the New York City Police Department arrested Dillard.

Chaos in Harlem
Cage and Misty Knight at Mariah Dillard's trial
Following her arrest, Mariah Dillard was put on trial for her crimes and her bail was denied, as judge Amanda Garmon ordered that she be sent into Ryker's Island. During the trial, Dillard warned the audience and the court that there was a storm coming to Harlem now that she was imprisoned. Dillard claimed that the Stokes Crime Family has acted as a barrier to keep other powerful criminals from Harlem. With her gone, they will threaten Harlem.

Dillard's warning proved correct, as the fall of Black Mariah and no central leadership for the gangs in Harlem, the community became a territory for the other powerful crime families of New York City to conquer and fight over. Gang violence and murders became rampant. Cage and Misty Knight found themselves dealing with a Harlem in chaos. Cage lamented the situation has gotten worse with Dillard imprisoned.

While Cage had attempted to figure on who was responsible for all of the attacks, with the help of Sugar and Dave Griffith, they were then interrupted by a visit from Shades. Despite the tension, Shades had explained that Rosalie Carbone was responsible for the current situation in Harlem and advised Cage to take control of Harlem in order to protect it.

Raid of Rosalie Carbone's Office
Cage personally confronting Rosalie Carbone
Cage was informed by Sugar that he had managed to learn about Rosalie Carbone's current location and informed Cage. He arrived to Carbone's Office where he was confronted by Carbone Crime Family members. Cage made his way through the office, taking down all criminals on his way, before he reached to Carbone. Cage demanded that Carbone stays out of Harlem, but she answered that she was born in Harlem and had a plans for it. When she threatened that Cage could not kill her as that would make her associates from the Russian Mafia attack schools and playgrounds in retribution for her death, Cage retaliated by threatening to attack her trucks and warehouses. Relenting, Carbone asked for Cage's demands. He stated where Carbone was not allowed to go to in Harlem and left, once the negotiation was dealt with.

Conversation with Sugar
Later, Cage was informed by Sugar that former members of the Stokes Crime Family have been found murdered. Cage attempted to ask Misty Knight for clearance to see Mariah Dillard and talk to her. When she refused, Cage called Foggy Nelson and asked him for the personal phone number of Benjamin Donovan. With Nelson's help, Cage managed to talk to Donovan and negotiate a meeting with Dillard.

Assassination of Mariah Dillard
Cage talking with Mariah Dillard inside prison
Cage headed to Ryker's Island to talk to Mariah Dillard and he informed her that he has talked to Rosalie Carbone and kept Harlem safe from her. Cage demanded Dillard to stop undermining the peace that he brokered. Meanwhile, Dillard kept taunting Cage, stating that Cage was responsible for making her who she was. She also told Cage that she was happy that Harlem's new "king" turned out to be him.

Cage watching Mariah Dillard die in his arms
Before they could continue their talk, Dillard began violently vomiting blood. She has been poisoned by Tilda Johnson from their previous visit. Cage went by Dillard's side. With no one coming to help her and nothing that Cage could do, he informed his dying enemy that he could not save her but he would stay by her side partly out of compassion but also out of a desire to watch her die. As Dillard gasped her last breath, she told Cage that their conflict was not done yet and died in Cage's arms.

Boss of Harlem
Mariah Dillard's Will
Cage getting promised that the will be peace
In the wake of Mariah Dillard's death, Cage had returned back to the Pop's Barber Shop to talk with Dave Griffith and Sugar about what happened. They were visited by Sheldon who subtly implied that the Stylers won't cause anymore trouble in Harlem now that the community was in Cage's hands. Griffith questioned Cage about what he has done to protect Harlem and Cage informed him that he had been talking to the other crime bosses. Griffith informed Cage that what he did was no different than being another crime boss. Griffith told Cage that he will use the money he earned from selling his merchandise to buy the lease for barbershop and keep Pop's legacy for his shop as a neutral ground alive that means Cage couldn't stay and conduct his activities. Cage agreed and respected his friend's wish. They were soon visited by Benjamin Donovan who asked to talk to Cage. No longer welcomed in the barbershop and despite Griffith's final plead to not continue on his current path, Cage and Sugar left.

Cage being gifted all of the Harlem's Paradise
Meeting at Harlem's Paradise with Donovan and Tilda Johnson, Cage was informed of Dillard's final will. Much to Cage's surprise and Johnson's fury, Dillard had left the club to Cage. At first, Cage considered burning the club, but after further consideration, Cage believed that he could use the club to keep crimes from harming Harlem and with him as the 'sheriff'. Ultimately, Cage accepted the club and immediately began the reparation.

Owner of Harlem's Paradise
Cage and Sugar talk in front of Misty Knight
Not long after, Cage established himself with the community with his presence and new status preventing most crimes from happening in Harlem and reopened the club. Cage hired several new employees and made Sugar his second. During the reopening, Cage was visited by Misty Knight who asked why Cage didn't refuse Dillard's offer. He explained with the crime being organized in the club, he can ensure that they won't hurt Harlem as long as he was there. Knight warned Cage that if he ever becomes corrupted by his new life, she won't hesitate to arrest him. Cage replied that he counted on that. He was informed by Sugar that Rosalie Carbone and Anibal Izqueda had arrived. Cage asked Sugar to place them in the VIPs and urged Knight to leave the office as he conducted his business.

Cage tells Sugar to send Claire Temple home
As the night proceeded, Cage enjoyed the musical performance of Rakim, singing King's Paradise. While watching, Sugar informed him that Claire Temple has come to visit him. After a moment of hesitation and guilt, Cage ordered Sugar to tell Temple to return home not wanting to risk her safety and show any weakness to the other crime bosses.

Cage becoming the new crime boss of Harlem
As Sugar headed out to perform his task, Cage quietly retired back to his new office. As he contemplated from his new throne and his new kingdom, Cage remembered his father's warning about the temptation of power and his advice about being a hero. Grimly, Cage began his new life as the new owner of Harlem's Paradise and vowed to protect Harlem from crime by controlling it.

Visit to Hell's Kitchen
Cage visits Jessica Jones in Hell's Kitchen
After seeing Jessica Jones and Trish Walker on the news in a story negatively referencing their vigilantism, Cage went to Hell's Kitchen and visited Jones. After a short catch-up in which Jones approved of Cage's new outfit, Cage warned Jones that he too had tried to protect someone important to him, mentioning Willis Stryker being sent to the Raft, and told Jones that she needed to stop Walker from causing more trouble.

Personality
Keeping a low profile, avoiding altercations that might attract suspicious or police activity and generally remaining as normal a person he can be, Luke Cage tends to be aloof, mysterious and sometimes cold due to having to remain as physically and emotionally distant as possible to keep his tragic and violent past from catching up with him in the present. Whilst attempting to lead a normal life, in some situations like running his own bar in Hell's Kitchen or in Harlem, Cage is capable of being sociable and genial, but ultimately makes few friends on a whole. His choice to fight crime was only due to Pop's death, as he was guilty over his striving to lead a normal life leading to someone close to him dying. Beforehand, Pop had to refer to the debt Cage owed him for keeping his secret to get him to help Chico Diaz. Also, he strove not to become too exposed lest his past as Carl Lucas be revealed and he'd be imprisoned yet again. Viewing his abilities as a curse, Cage dreads to use his super-strength and durability, that is unless the situation is absolutely necessary, as he only "protects [himself] and what's [his]." This mentality is evident when he fights off several opponents in his bar, unknowingly revealing his abilities to a group of patrons and when he agreed to find Antoine Grier for his sister. Jaded as he is, Cage is a good man at heart and a loyal friend to the few he has. He is also impeccably polite, respectful, and does his best not to upset others.

Cage also loved his wife, Reva Connors dearly as she was the only thing during his time at Seagate that gave him hope and kept him sane. When she was killed, he was said to have become obsessed with discovering how it happened. He was even dragged out of the MTA by eight guards when he angrily confronted the administrator there, Serena Grier, to find out more about the crash and she was unable to calm him down. When confronting the man (who supposedly) killed Reva, Cage, blinded by love for his wife and rage, reveals his super abilities with the full intention of murdering him, although he did have enough restraint to calm himself down from attacking Jessica Jones when it was revealed she was the one that killed Reva but scolded her quite harshly over this confession. Upon discovering that Reva had lied to him all along and was aware of the experimentation at Seagate and also recommended him to the experiment that gave him super strength, Cage is deeply disturbed and completely moves on from her death, claiming the memory of Reva was now ruined, but he still loved the idea of her. Cage was very protective of his Hell's Kitchen bar, Luke's due to it being the only memory of Reva he had left, keeping it clean and protecting it from damage. When Kilgrave had him destroy his bar, leaving him with no real connection to Hell's Kitchen, Cage left to live a new life in Harlem. He has engaged in relationships with other women after Reva such as Gina, Jessica Jones, Misty Knight, and Claire Temple but he still loves his wife even after her death. Despite this slight promiscuous side, Cage treats women with the utmost respect as Knight was flattered by the way he looked into her eyes rather than breasts whilst staking out Cottonmouth wearing a low-cut dress.

In battling criminals, Cage is confident and humorous due to knowing that he cannot be injured or killed in combat or by guns. Whilst usually quiet, such as during his attack on Crispus Attucks, he is not above a sarcastic or witty comment. When Zip and several other criminals were holding up Lin's restaurant, Cage reprimands Zip for his harsh tone of voice and disrespect towards Connie before fighting them. Similarly, when confronting Domingo Colon at his boxing ring and Colon's goons drew their guns on him, Cage only reacts by saying that "[they] hadn't heard of [him]" and stating dryly that "[he] was tired of buying new clothes" after being shot by them. According to Claire, he is corny due to his constant one-liners and humorous remarks. Cage often destroys firearms when given the chance, either after or during a fight, sometimes even before combat begins.

Due to gaining his powers by accident and doing his best not to use them, therefore not training himself how to use them, Cage does not entirely know the limits of his own abilities which has led him to break bones, sending enemies flying into the air and through walls and land almost-fatal punches. He even attacked a large group of opponents with a sofa and threw it at a gunman, though it missed and crashed out a window instead. Fortunately, he has not killed anyone but this is by Cage's own restraint as murder will get him back into the police system, eventually creating a line that Luke Cage is Carl Lucas and will be imprisoned yet again. He acknowledged that while he would want to not have to use restraint, it would kill his opponents if he did not when warning Zip and his men not to fight him. One way he limits the amount of damage he does to his opponents is slapping them unconscious. Because Cage does not tend to classify himself or his actions as heroic, though on several occasions he has displayed the willingness to kill such as ambushing Charles Wallace whom he thought had killed Reva. Also, when a wounded and dying Rafael Scarfe revealed that he killed Chico Diaz, Cage began strangling Scarfe to death without any emotion on his face until Claire Temple reminded him that he was not a killer. When confronting Turk Barrett on ratting out Chico and inadvertently leading Tone to shoot and killing Pop, he spared his life despite threatening to crush him and then nearly crushing a dumpster with Turk in it to get him to reveal Diamondback's location before leaving him trapped in it. This murderous side is prominently evident whenever he loses emotional control which causes Cage to become carelessly destructive with his super-abilities to anything or anyone around him. An example of this is when he destroyed Noah Burstein's entire barn upon learning that Reva was included on his accident, seemingly not caring if Burnstein was caught in between his rampage.

Unlike the rest of New York's vigilantes, such as Daredevil and Spider-Man, he does not have a secret identity or costume and his hero work is seen in the light of day among Harlem's citizens. Although initially remaining discrete whilst planning to bring down Stokes, he eventually revealed his identity and what he was doing after surviving Cottonmouth's assassination attempt on his life to prove his lack of fear thereof and to inspire others to move forward the same way Pop did to him. When deciding to keep helping people more, however, he considers a costume but Claire Temple encourages him to remain in the light as too much in Harlem already happens in the shadows, with the unsaid addendum that most of these shadowy acts are criminal in nature. Seeing a normal man stand up would give hope to its citizens rather than just a symbol of fear for its enemies. With inspiration from his friends, Cage gives up his secretive lifestyle to finally do some good, becoming a "man of the people" figure who isn't afraid to be seen in the light of day, openly fighting criminals such as the like of Cottonmouth and Diamondback.

Cage has a fondness for basketball and reading, with his favorite genre being detective stories.

Despite foregoing his former identity, Cage still has some qualities of his personality associated with the like of a son of a preacher. He has a dislike for cursing and he kept Pop's swear jar after his death to keep his memory alive and forced anyone who cursed in his presence to add money. He even salvaged it from the wreckage of Connie Lin's restaurant when Cottonmouth destroyed it due to the emotional connection of his dead friend. In addition, most of Cage's favorite songs are censored due to being heavily profane by nature. The alias of "Luke Cage" was also derived from his favorite bible verse that his father taught him.

While dealing with crime in Harlem, Cage is not above using questionable and dark methods to ensure the safety of his adopted home. Although he refuses to kill, Cage is not afraid to break bones or torture his opponents to get information. He is also willing to broker peace agreements with Harlem's crime lords, as he made a deal with Rosalie Carbone to put a 'lock-box' around Harlem and ordered her to control where she did her business as long as Harlem remained out of it. In addition, Cage was even willing to fully take control of Harlem in order to protect it by accepting ownership of Harlem's Paradise, a local nightclub where Stokes Crime Family did their illegal operations. His darker methods of stopping crime has frightened the likes of Claire Temple, Misty Knight, and Dave Griffith.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Artificially Enhanced Physiology: Cage underwent an experiment and came out with heightened physical abilities, most noticeably his amazing strength and durability. The experiment was meant for the creation of artificial skin for burn victims with a CRISPR process to fuse a subject's DNA with another, foreign DNA (abalone shell) to gain its attributes, specifically to genetically enhance the durability, pliability, and healing properties of human epidermis. His skin cells were bonded with hydrogen covalent bonds at the exact point of acidity, temperature and saline concentration as abalone shell. According to Claire Temple, Luke's epithelial cells are simultaneously super elastic and energy absorbent; the cells that line his organs are stuck together, but when she tries to pull them apart, they snap back together. After his second cellular treatment to remove Judas Bullet shrapnel, Claire theorized the abalone shell on his skin was strengthened, as he was able to resist Judas rounds from Arturo Rey III. Cottonmouth has compared him to Captain America after viewing his powerful performances of protecting Harlem.

Cage demonstrates his remarkable strength
Superhuman Strength: During a fight in his bar where multiple opponents attacked him, Cage effortlessly tossed them aside and overpowered them with one arm. Using just his fists, Cage is able to punch and dent the auto body of motor vehicles. He is also able to match Jessica Jones in strength, managing to push her back when she attempted to subdue him during his fight with her while he was under the influence of Kilgrave and when she attempted to hold him back from killing Charles Wallace. His strength allows him to easily rag doll, lift, drag and send normal humans flying. Cage can break bones with a swift kick, punch through solid brick walls, break guns in his hands with ease, knock a person unconscious with a slap to the head, kick down almost any door, bend metal bars and lift massive concrete blocks and heavy machinery, such as washing machines and refrigerators. When he and the Defenders were escaping from the NYPD, Cage was able to bend a metal bar to prevent a door from being opened. In a battle with the Stylers, Cage kicked a car with enough force to send one of the Jamaican criminals flying upon impact. Despite his strength, he is not invincible and can be overpowered by normal humans in large numbers, as eight guards managed to drag him out of the MTA when he went to Serena Grier to find out more about his wife's death. Len Sirkes and his men managed to hold him down temporarily and strike him repeatedly until he got the upper hand due to his durability and stamina, allowing him to outlast his weaker opponents. His power and restraint of it are believed to be at least somewhat connected to his own emotional state as he lost control of his strength when he discovered that Reva was involved in his experiment and destroyed Noah Burstein's entire barn in distress upon discovery of this revelation. Cage was also capable of containing the explosion of a M67 grenade in his hands. Cage is able to leap great heights and distances due to the superhuman strength in his legs. He measured 24 feet in attempting the broad jump, 11 feet longer than the world record. This also allowed him to jump several feet in the air over a bar stand while he shielded Misty Knight from gunfire, and to also jump onto the car of Piranha Jones' kidnappers from far away.
