<html><p>After being asked a second time, Barnes and Wilson then took the offer and joined Walker and Hoskins on their vehicle. However, after Hoskins mentioned he was called Battlestar and Walker referred to Wilson and Barnes as Captain America's wingmen, Barnes told the driver to stop the vehicle. He and Wilson then got off and left them.

Reunion with Isaiah Bradley
Barnes suggests stealing the shield
While on the plane back to the United States of America, Barnes suggested stealing the shield from John Walker again. However, Sam Wilson reminded him of what happened the last time, that Sharon Carter become an enemy of the state and he and Steve Rogers were in hiding for two years.

Barnes asking to speak with Isaiah Bradley
Back in the United States, Barnes took Wilson to Baltimore, Maryland to the house of Isaiah Bradley, a black super-soldier who he had met in the 1950s in the Korean War. His grandson, Eli Bradley answered the door and told them his grandfather would not be seeing them, but Barnes told him to tell Bradley something only he would know.

Barnes being reunited with Isaiah Bradley
After the two were let in, Barnes told Bradley that he thought there were more super-soldiers out there and asked for his help, only for Bradley to become angry, as he made it clear that he was not interested in helping them and angrily told them to leave.

Barnes being confronted by police officers
After the two left, Wilson asked Barnes why he had kept Bradley a secret and Barnes told him that no one had known about him. They were interrupted when Baltimore policemen arrived and stated that Barnes was under arrest for missing his mandated therapy.

Arrested and Released
Barnes is released
Barnes was taken to the police station, but was soon released. He was then taken to the main lobby where Christina Raynor, his therapist was waiting on him, as well as Sam Wilson. Raynor then instructed Barnes and Wilson to have a therapy session there at the station.

Barnes and Sam Wilson having their therapy
Barnes and Wilson were then asked to have open dialogue and Barnes told Wilson how he felt with him giving up the shield. After Wilson realized the therapy session was not for him, he left, and Barnes followed shortly after, before asking Raynor what the second rule was they discussed.

Barnes suggests they speak to Helmut Zemo
Outside the station, he and Wilson found John Walker and Lemar Hoskins waiting on them, but both turned down Walker's invitation to ally noting they were free agents. While walking down the street, Barnes told Wilson that he felt they needed to go and see Helmut Zemo to find out more about the Flag Smashers, which Wilson was highly reluctant about.

Escape of Helmut Zemo
Barnes at the Berlin Correctional Facility
Barnes and Sam Wilson went to see Helmut Zemo, who was in an isolated cell in the Berlin Correctional Facility. Barnes told Wilson that he had to see Zemo alone, citing his hatred of the Avengers. Wilson pointed out to Barnes that Zemo did not particularly have a amicable relationship with Barnes either.

Barnes meets with Helmut Zemo
Barnes went inside the cell and came face to face with Zemo, who was on the other side of glass. Zemo was surprised that he was there and recited the Winter Soldier Programming words, only for Barnes to say that did not work anymore. Zemo then told him that he knew that, but was just messing with him. Stepping closer to the glass, Zemo looked into Barnes' eyes, claiming that he still saw the Winter Soldier in him. Changing the subject, Zemo noted that Barnes had the luxury of being kept in a Cryostasis Chamber during his imprisonment, to which Barnes insisted that it had not been a pleasant time.

Barnes leaves after giving Helmut Zemo the means to escape
Zemo had then apologized to Barnes, insisting that his actions in framing him for T'Chaka's murder had never been personal, while calling him a means to an end. Barnes changed the subject and told Zemo that someone had recreated the Super Soldier Serum which got Zemo's attention and believed that Barnes was desperate to have to have come for his assistance. Barnes then asked Zemo what book he was reading and was given the book, after Zemo slipped it under the glass. Barnes then put a key card inside the book and returned it to Zemo, before leaving the cell, thus having given Zemo the means to escape the prison. 

Barnes tells Sam Wilson about orchestrating Zemo's escape
Barnes and Wilson left the facility and Barnes took him to a garage nearby. After Wilson questioned what happened in the cell, Barnes told him in an indirect way that he had started a prison riot to allow for Zemo's escape. When Wilson figured that out and saw Zemo walking into the room, he got upset with Barnes for having freed Zemo without talking to him first. Wilson demanded that Zemo be returned to prison, but Barnes argued that they needed him. While they were talking, Zemo tried to intervene, but was immediately silenced by them.

Barnes waiting on Helmut Zemo to get ready
Barnes and Wilson took Zemo to his garage so he could get his belongings. After Zemo gathered his belongings, he took Barnes and Wilson to an airfield. Barnes and Wilson were brought by Zemo to his private plane and they flew off. On the plane, Zemo told them that they didn't know what life had been like in the correctional facility, but that Wilson might since he was on the Raft at one point.

Barnes threatens Helmut Zemo
Zemo became fascinated while reading Barnes' notebook, questioning who Nakajima was. In response, Barnes launched out of his seat and grabbed Zemo by the throat, vowing to kill him if he ever touched the notebook again. Zemo apologized, noting that he understood that it was a list of names of the people he had wronged as the Winter Soldier, while Barnes warned Zemo not to push his luck any more. 

Barnes listens to Helmut Zemo
Zemo then informed them that they were going to Madripoor, while Wilson questioned what this place was, to which Barnes explained that it was an island in Indonesia, with Zemo noting that it was a lawless place. However, Zemo explained that they could not walk into Madripoor as themselves, as members of the Avengers would likely draw far too much attention, as Zemo informed Barnes that he would have to become the Winter Soldier once again, which Barnes reluctantly agreed to.

Journey to Madripoor
Barnes discusses the plan with Helmut Zemo
Once they arrived on the outskirts of Madripoor, Helmut Zemo told Barnes and Sam Wilson that they needed to remain in character upon entering the city. Once they had arrived inside Madripoor's centre, Barnes and Wilson were led by Zemo through the streets, passing armed guards and secret dealings along the way, as he took them past the Princess Bar and instead took them to the Brass Monkey.

Barnes pretends to be the Winter Soldier
After the Power Broker's henchmen had laid a hand on Zemo, Barnes was signalled by Zemo to pretend to be the Winter Soldier. Barnes then unleashed his Winter Soldier brutality upon the men and easily fought against them. While he was choking a man using his vibranium arm, Zemo stopped him, telling him they had to stay in character, before the bartender told them they could be seen by Selby.

Barnes stays in character while at Selby's
Zemo explained that he wanted Selby to tell them everything they knew about the Super Soldier Serum, and in exchange, he would give her the Winter Soldier, as Zemo walked over to Barnes, who did not react, promising that he would give Selby the code words that would allow her to control him. Zemo had continued to mock Barnes, by caressing his face while promising that he would do anything that Selby required of him, with Selby noting that this was more like the Zemo she remembered, noting that she was glad she did not immediately have him killed.

Barnes and Sam Wilson run from the bounty hunters
Selby informed them that the Super Soldier Serum was on Madripoor, where it was being developed by Wilfred Nagel, who had been recruited by the Power Broker to work on the serum, but things had since not gone to plan. However, after Wilson's phone rang and his cover was blown, Selby ordered them killed, only to be killed herself by a sniper. Following Selby's death, a bounty was placed on Barnes, Wilson, and Zemo immediately. Zemo urged them to leave and the three made a run for it out of the city as bounty hunters started appearing everywhere. 

Barnes is found and saved by Sharon Carter
The three found themselves saved from the bounty hunters when Sharon Carter stepped out of the shadows and removed her hoodie. Barnes and Wilson told her not to shoot at Zemo who she wanted too, since it was his fault that she had to go into hiding. When asked why she was there, Carter reminded them of her going into hiding after stealing Captain America's Shield and the EXO-7 Falcon. She then agreed to help them and led them to her apartment.

Undercover Mission
Barnes is teased by Sharon Carter
At Carter's apartment, Barnes relaxed on the couch while Wilson changed clothes and Zemo got a drink. Carter then asked how John Walker was and noted that Barnes had always believed in a patriotic worldview, teasing him about being Captain America's best friend in World War II and how he was "Mr. America." Barnes listened on as Wilson explained how the Flag Smashers had stolen the Super Soldier Serum, noting that Wilfred Nagel was their lead, who worked for the Power Broker. Although she warned them to stay out of this, Carter had eventually agreed to help them, if Wilson helped to clear her name. 

Barnes witnesses the night party
With Carter agreeing to help, she explained that she would be hosting a party with some connected people, and advised them to stay out of trouble. At Carter's party which was in a night-club setting, Barnes kept an eye on Zemo. Eventually, Carter rejoined Barnes, Wilson, and Zemo, explaining that she had been able to locate Nagel, and they left.

Ambush at the Shipyard
Barnes getting ready to meet Wilfred Nagel
The following day, Barnes followed Sharon Carter's lead to the Buccaneer Bay shipyard on the outskirts of Madripoor and Carter reminded them that was still a bounty on their heads. Carter led them to a container where Wilfred Nagel seemingly was, giving each of them an earpiece so they could stay in contact, while she would stay outside to keep watch. Helmut Zemo led Barnes and Sam Wilson into Nagel's Laboratory. Entering the lab, Barnes and Wilson raised their guns, and soon found Nagel working on the Super Soldier Serum, as they turned off his music and surprised him.

Barnes holds Wilfred Nagel at gunpoint
Although Nagel tried to force them out, he stopped once he saw Barnes, recognising him as Winter Soldier, while Nagel introduced Zemo, noting that Nagel would have heard of Zemo. While Nagel attempted to suggest they make a deal, Carter warned Barnes and the others on the radios that bounty hunters were arriving at the shipyard. 

Barnes listens to Wilfred Nagel
Barnes listened as Nagel explained that HYDRA had recruited him into their Winter Soldier Program, continuing their work after the Winter Soldiers had failed to be controlled. Barnes listened to Nagel as he explained that he had come to Madripoor following the Blip, where the Power Broker funded his work, noting that he had created twenty vials of the serum, before Karli Morgenthau stole them. Once Carter stormed into the lab, warning that they were out of time, Zemo shot Nagel in the chest, killing him before Wilson and Carter took the gun away from him.

Barnes fights the bounty hunters
Within seconds, a bounty hunter shot the laboratory causing it to explode and Barnes, Wilson, and Carter hit the ground to avoid the blast. After they got back up, they noticed that Zemo had escaped. The three quickly found themselves cornered, but soon saw Zemo on top of a container shooting at the hunters, causing another explosion. Once they could run clear from the bounty hunters, they made their escape, and ran throughout the shipyard. As they were running, Barnes threw a pole into one of the hunters' shoulders. 

Barnes in the getaway car
After running throughout the shipyard, Barnes, Wilson, and Carter were shortly met by Zemo who had stolen a getaway car. When Barnes got in the car, he got in the front seat and told Wilson he wouldn't give it up, who was forced to sit in the back. This was reminiscent of when he didn't give up his front seat for Barnes in 2016. So Wilson sat in the back as Zemo drove off away to his private plane.

Tensions Increasing
Confronted by the Dora Milaje
Barnes and Sam Wilson discuss the shield
While on the plane, Barnes was told by Wilson of a lead in Riga, Latvia about a woman named Donya Madani who had just died at a Global Repatriation Council camp. After Wilson said that he wishes he had destroyed the shield, Barnes said he would take it if that was the case.

Barnes talking with Ayo
Upon arriving in Riga, Barnes noticed Kimoyo Beads lying in the street and told Wilson and Zemo he would meet up with them shortly. He followed the beads down the street and soon came face to face with Ayo. She demanded to know where Zemo was and asked why Barnes had allowed him to escape prison. Barnes, who had learned Xhosa, spoke fluently and told a disappointed Ayo that Zemo was a means to an end, to which she said he had eight hours left with Zemo. After Ayo left, Barnes returned to the building where they were staying.

Searching for the Funeral
Barnes and Sam Wilson inside the GRC Camp
Back in the room, Barnes talked with Sam Wilson and Helmut Zemo and they decided to go search for Donya Madani's funeral by exploring the Global Repatriation Council's refugee camp. At the camp, Barnes and Wilson split up and found that the refugees living there were followers of the the Flag Smashers. With no luck in getting the funeral location, Barnes and Wilson met up in the courtyard where they watched Zemo talking with the refugee children, and were suspicious after Zemo got a girl to whisper something in his ear.

Tensions with Helmut Zemo
Barnes gets upset with Helmut Zemo
After getting a drink, Barnes walked over and sat on the couch opposite Sam Wilson. However, after Helmut Zemo had mentioned leverage over them, Barnes walked over and threw his drink out the window. He then threatened Zemo not to speak of leverage, until Wilson walked up and told Barnes to control his temper.

Funeral Interrupted
Barnes is confronted by John Walker
They followed Zemo through the streets, until they ran into Captain America and Battlestar who ended up joining them to the funeral location. At the building, Walker handcuffed Zemo to the wall, while Wilson went into the funeral to speak with Karli Morgenthau. Barnes stayed outside the room, standing in the doorframe. However, Captain America, growing impatient, tested Barnes' patience and mocked him for having the serum. He then told Barnes that if something happened to Wilson, it would be on his hands.

Barnes chases after Karli Morgenthau
Eventually, Captain America broke into the room and threatened to arrest Morgenthau, leading her to flee. Barnes gave chase and leaped down the floor to the next floor, only to lose Morgenthau. He and Wilson met up and continued to search the building. Along with Battlestar, they eventually found Captain America standing next to an unconscious Zemo.

Skirmish with the Dora Milaje
Barnes gets a drink
Once they had returned back to their building in which they were staying, Barnes got a drink while Sam Wilson talked to Helmut Zemo, who was recovering from getting knocked out.

Barnes tries to stop Ayo
Barnes then realized the eight hours were up when Ayo, and two other Dora Milaje named Yama and Nomble arrived to arrest Zemo. Barnes and Wilson watched as Captain America challenged Ayo and then started fighting her and the others with Battlestar joining in. Barnes mocked Captain America as he struggled to fight against the Dora Milaje. Soon Wilson asked Barnes if they should intervene, so Barnes tried to stop Ayo telling her they should talk over it, but she detached his vibranium arm instead, disappointed with him for having freed Zemo. 

Barnes reattaches his vibranium arm
Once Ayo realized Zemo escaped, she and the other Dora Milaje left, while Barnes reattached his arm while still in shock that Ayo had removed it. Afterwards, he and Wilson left the room shortly, leaving Captain America and Battlestar behind.

Battling the Flag Smashers
Barnes and Falcon confront Karli Morgenthau
Back on the street, Barnes walked with Sam Wilson and heard from Wilson after he got a phone call that Karli Morgenthau wanted to meet with him alone. Barnes told him he was coming too and went with Wilson to an abandoned building, where they saw Morgenthau. Morgenthau noticed Falcon did not come alone, looking at Barnes, and told Falcon that she did not want to kill him, rather ask if he would join her. 

Barnes fights the Flag Smashers
When Falcon got a notification from Sharon Carter about Captain America, Falcon told Barnes they had to move. Barnes leaped off the balcony only to get slammed into by Morgenthau who leaped the same time. As Falcon flew off, Barnes got back up and chased after Morgenthau as they ran towards the location. Once at the location, Barnes saved Falcon from Diego, jokingly telling him he was welcome, before engaging with another Flag Smasher using his knife mastery.

Barnes and Falcon watch Captain America's incident
After Battlestar was killed by Morgenthau and Captain America sped after the Flag Smashers, Barnes and Wilson left the building. Outside, Barnes and Wilson watched in the public square as Captain America murdered Nico with the shield, while onlookers watched in horror at the sight.

Fighting for the Shield
Barnes confronts Captain America
Following Captain America's incident, Barnes and Falcon chased after him to an abandoned warehouse and confronted him. Sympathizing with Captain America's desire to kill the Flag Smashers and his grief over Battlestar's death, despite their previous argument, Barnes attempted to reason with him, stating that the path Captain America was going through would not end well, but as Captain America adamantly rebuked Barnes, stating he was not like him, and made it clear he would not give up the shield, Barnes, realizing there was no other way, solemnly stated they would when Captain America asked if they would fight him for the shield.

Barnes fights Captain America
Barnes and Falcon then started a vicious fight with Captain America, faring better than Wilson and disarming him of his pistol, but still being overwhelmed by Captain America combination of his shield and martial arts. Eventually, Captain America threw the shield at Barnes, sending him flying back. Barnes caught the shield and Walker fiercely reclaimed it, throwing Barnes flying into an electric circuit, causing Barnes to fall to the ground and momentarily be knocked out. 

Barnes furiously fights Captain America
Barnes regained consciousness in time to save Falcon, as Captain America was about to kill him with the shield, and tackled Captain America, freeing Falcon. Barnes then delivered several blows on Captain America and upon being knocked down managed to stop him from using the shield to kill him and then proceeded to help Falcon yank the shield out of his hand, breaking Captain America's arm in the process.

Barnes leaves the shield with Falcon
Captain America tried to take the shield again from Falcon, but with Captain America now disarmed, Barnes easily defeated him, punching him in the face before proceeding to lift him off the ground by the shoulder and allow Falcon to deal the finishing blow with the shield, knocking them all to the ground and Walker out for good. Barnes then got back up and grabbed the shield, dropping it next to Falcon, and then gave him a look of disappointment before leaving the warehouse. 

Barnes at the Global Repatriation Council camp
Following their fight with Captain America, Barnes and Wilson went back to the Global Repatriation Council resettlement camp and met with Joaquin Torres there. Upon arriving, Torres greeted Barnes and commented on how Barnes seemed to have gotten his sleeve back after having ripped it off back to jump out of the plane in Munich. Leaving Wilson and Torres, Barnes traveled to find Helmut Zemo.

Amends with Helmut Zemo
Barnes finding Helmut Zemo within Sokovia
Barnes went to Sokovia to the Sokovian Memorial where he found Helmut Zemo. Zemo commented that he had decided not to kill Barnes, and Barnes replied sarcastically that he was relieved. Zemo told Barnes that he needed to kill Karli Morgenthau as he was programmed to kill once, and that Sam Wilson was too stubborn like Steve Rogers to do so. However, Barnes told him that he and Wilson had other plans on how to handle Morgenthau. 

Barnes threatening to shoot Helmut Zemo
Barnes then took out his handgun and pointed it at Zemo’s face, with Zemo embracing it, knowing his fate. Barnes then smiled and dropped the blank bullets out of his hand, showing Zemo that he wasn’t a killer anymore and how he was a free man. The Dora Milaje led by Ayo arrived then and arrested Zemo. Zemo wished Barnes well and told him he had crossed his name off in his book, before being led away. 

Barnes speaks with Ayo about Helmut Zemo
Ayo told Barnes that Zemo would be going to the Raft and told Barnes to lay low from Wakanda for sometime due to his involvement with Zemo's escape. She also called him White Wolf, signalling she wasn’t disappointed with him anymore. She then left, but Barnes stopped her, and asked for a favor from them for Wilson.

Working with Sam Wilson
Barnes visiting Sam Wilson
After receiving a box from the Wakandans, Barnes returned to the United States of America and went to Delacroix, Louisiana to be with Sam Wilson. He arrived, bringing the box with him, and helped lift a heavy box off of the Wilson's family boat, surprising Wilson who was pleased to see him. Barnes then gave Wilson the box. He also helped Wilson out but used his right arm instead, with Wilson questioning why he didn't use his vibranium arm.

Barnes meets Sarah Wilson
Shortly, Barnes was introduced to Wilson's sister Sarah, who was happy to meet him. Later in the day, Barnes told Wilson that he would stay at a nearby hotel, but Wilson told him to stay with him at Sarah's house instead. For the next few days, as Barnes stayed with Wilson, he opted to sleep on the couch at Sarah's house, where he met Wilson's nephews Cass Wilson and AJ Wilson. 

Barnes helps fix the boat
Working with Wilson on the boat, Barnes occasionally would watch Wilson struggle with manually removing objects, and then use his vibranium arm to lift it easily. Each time Barnes saw Sarah, he would say hello to her and give her a big smile, leading Wilson to jokingly tell him not to flirt with her.

Barnes and Sam Wilson practice throwing the shield
After fixing the boat, Barnes and Wilson practiced training with the shield. Barnes had no problem throwing and catching the shield, but Wilson had to work harder at it. As they were practicing, Barnes apologized to Wilson for criticizing him after he gave the shield to the government and told him that the shield was of sentimental value to him. He then told Wilson that when he and Steve Rogers talked the night before Rogers handed Wilson the shield, they had no idea what it would have been like for a black man to have the shield. Wilson understood, and helped Barnes come to peace with his time brainwashed as the Winter Soldier and told him to not just help himself, but the victims of the Winter Soldier's actions. 

Barnes and Sam Wilson acknowledge their friendship
Barnes agreed and expressed his gratitude for Wilson's pep talk, knowing that Wilson use to be a counselor. They then did a handshake hug and commented on how they weren't technically friends but more like co-workers, but then realized they were actually friends. Barnes then told Wilson to call him once he heard from the Flag Smashers, patted him on the shoulder, and left for New York City.

Stopping the Flag Smashers
Barnes arrives at the GRC Meeting Hall
Barnes returned to New York City, suited up, and walked over to the GRC Meeting Hall. As he was walking over, he passed a NYPD officer who greeted him and recognized him as Sergeant Barnes. 

Barnes is reunited with Sharon Carter
Before he could get to the building, Barnes was stopped by a man, which was revealed to be Sharon Carter wearing a Photostatic Veil. Surprised, Barnes asked Carter what she was doing there without being pardoned and if she was worried, but Carter responded saying that no one would notice her there. In communications with Captain America, Barnes hooks Carter up to join their line and the two go inside the GRC building. However, Carter is unable to continue as she sets off security check and tells Barnes that she will go rescue the GRC hostages from the parking garage.

Barnes talks to Karli Morgenthau
Barnes goes up to the second level, and is promptly handed a phone by a woman who told him the caller is for him. He answered the phone and found the caller to be Karli Morgenthau. Barnes told Morgenthau that she will regret her actions as it will always haunt her if she doesn't back down, until realising that Morgenthau had distracted him by the call. Frustrated for having fallen for the trap, Barnes ran out to the parking garage and hopped onto a motorcycle. 

Barnes rides a motorcycle to get to the Flag Smashers
Riding the motorcycle out of the garage and onto the street, Barnes was asked by Wilson to help with a helicopter rescue, only for Barnes to say that that was in Wilson's category since he was the only one who could fly. After locating the armored trucks carrying the GRC hostages in a construction site, Barnes rammed his motorcycle into the barrier, flipping him over to the position to tackle Dovich. As Barnes easily overpowered Dovich, Morgenthau told her teammates to set one of the trucks on fire so Barnes could rescue the hostages, allowing for her to escape. 

Barnes rescues the GRC hostages
Upon seeing the truck on fire, Barnes knocked down Dovich and went to save the hostages. Seeing that the truck was locked shut by a device, Barnes used his vibranium arm to pull it off and then opened the doors. He then helped the hostages off the truck and away from the fire, with one hostage thanking Barnes for rescuing them. 

Barnes returns to fight the Flag Smashers
Returning to fight the Flag Smashers, Barnes saw John Walker trying to fight them and came to his help. Barnes punched Dovich into construction equipment and fought Morgenthau, who tore a parking meter out of the ground and swung it at him. Dodging her blows, Barnes grabbed a heavy chain and swung it at her, knocking her down, only for Dovich to kick him away. Barnes landed on the riverbank below as Dovich landed down to engage him. Forced into combat with Dovich and unable to help any longer, Barnes was able to defeat Dovich once again even when he was using a metal bar. 

Barnes and John Walker watch Captain America
Barnes then watched as one of the trucks drove off the ledge barely and as Walker's shield was flung over to the riverbank. He then saw the Flag Smashers grab Walker and cause them all to fall down to the riverbank also. Barnes then helped Walker up and watched as Captain America, in his new uniform, pushed the truck back to the ground, saving the hostages. Barnes smiled upon seeing this. 

Barnes and John Walker team up
Upon seeing the hostages were saved, Morgenthau then threw a pole at Barnes, but he caught it easily. Captain America then arrived, hitting the Flag Smashers back with the shield. Barnes then watched as Georges Batroc filled the air with smoke, allowing the Flag Smashers to escape. Barnes, Captain America, and Walker teamed up and chased after them into the underground tunnels. After Captain America suggested they split up, Barnes went with Walker, realising that Walker may need his help. Barnes used the phone given to him earlier to send a message the last three Flag Smashers through their app to meet them at a location. Then he and Walker waited until DeeDee, Gigi, and Dovich arrived, looking confused. The New York City Police Department units then swarmed them and took the three into custody, while Barnes and Walker walked away, with Walker giving Barnes a friendly pat.

Barnes speaks with Captain America
Barnes and Walker walked back to the street and witnessed Captain America's speech to the rescued GRC members and news reporters. Barnes said goodbye to Walker and waited for Captain America to come over to him. Barnes then told him that he only heard a little bit of the speech, teasingly, before calling him Cap in approvement, and patting the shield.

Barnes with Captain America and Sharon Carter
Barnes and Captain America then met with Sharon Carter, who was injured and leaning against a parked car. Barnes and Captain America both told her she needed to get medical treatment, but Carter refused. After Captain America had to leave, Barnes went with Carter and helped her leave the area.

Being at Peace
Telling the Truth
Barnes telling Yori Nakajima the truth
Afterwards, Barnes went to Yori Nakajima's apartment and surprised Nakajima, who said that it wasn't a Wednesday and commented on how late it was. Nakajima then invited Barnes inside, and Barnes told him that he needed to tell him something. They sat down and Barnes told Nakajima that he, as the Winter Soldier, had killed Nakajima's son. Nakajima then asked why Barnes did and Barnes told him that he had had no choice in the matter. He then left a shocked and confused Nakajima and returned to his apartment. 

Barnes sees Leah and Yori Nakajima
The next day, Barnes dropped his completed notebook in a bag at Christina Raynor's office along with a note thanking her for helping him. He then walked outside Izzy and looked inside the window seeing Nakajima at the bar talking with Leah. After making eye contact with Leah, Barnes left New York City.

Lousiana Cookout
Barnes arrives at the cookout
Barnes then returned to Delacroix, Louisiana and attended the community's cookout, bringing a cake for dessert. Upon arriving, he was greeted enthusiastically by AJ and Cass, who called him "Uncle Bucky." He then hugged Sam Wilson and greeted Sarah, before joining them to eat and have fellowship. 

Barnes and Sam Wilson at peace
Feeling relaxed and comfortable in doing so, Barnes showed his vibranium arm to AJ, Cass, and other children, while Sarah watched and laughed. After the cookout, Barnes and Wilson watched as the sun went down on the water and both smiled, since both were feeling good about themselves. Barnes, opting to stay there with Wilson, then walked back with Wilson to talk with the community.

Personality
Prior to his brainwashing, Bucky Barnes was extremely devoted, loyal, headstrong, and patriotic with a strong moral center. He was a good and close friend to Steve Rogers during their youth; he helped him when he got into fights and tried to cheer him up and look after him when Rogers' mother died. Best friends since childhood, they went through many trials and tribulations together. He was also protective of Rogers, as demonstrated when Steve planned to enlist in the United States Army. Barnes tried to talk him out of it, as he knew he would die because of his physical condition and poor health. 

Due to his advanced physiology, however, Barnes survived his apparent death but was found by HYDRA instead. Trained as a living weapon, Barnes became a new man so to speak, as his memories and identity were constantly being wiped until he was augmented into the perfect assassin, the Winter Soldier. As the Winter Soldier, he was brutal and ruthless with an utter lack of conscience, and remorselessly followed HYDRA's every order. Even so, he still saved Steve Rogers from drowning after the Insight Helicarrier blew up. Although he tells Steve he did not know why he did it, it was due to Rogers reminding him of who he was, to which he initially reacted with violence before finally accepting the truth of it.

While he still holds a mostly serious and introverted demeanor, he retains a sense of humor, as shown when he and Falcon both smiled with approval at Rogers' kiss with Sharon Carter and later as he and Captain America reminisced over earlier times in their friendship. His sense of humor can also be dry at times, as shown when he asked Wilson why he couldn't use Redwing on Spider-Man earlier. Barnes was shown to be a fan of board games, during his date with Leah. He also retains his flirtatious nature, constantly flirting with Sarah Wilson, much to her brother's annoyance.

Even though Barnes has regained his identity and former values, he has also developed a guilt-ridden conscience, and became deeply ashamed and remorseful over his actions as the Winter Soldier. He previously stated that he has an absolute memory of every person he has killed, and acknowledges with great regret and self-loathing that the fact he was brainwashed does not change the fact that he killed them. Upon watching his murder of Howard and Maria Stark, he was visibly stunned and ashamed of what he had done. Fearing for his mental state changing and what he might bring about those around him, Barnes ultimately decided that placing himself in cryogenic stasis until he could be cured of HYDRA's mental programming completely would be the best course of action.

After being cured of HYDRA's programming, Barnes appears to have come to terms with his past. As the White Wolf, Barnes lived quietly in Wakanda, where he spent his time entertaining the children and farming, until T'Challa asked for his assistance in the Battle of Wakanda. When presented with a replacement cybernetic arm, Barnes, recognizing its meaning, didn't hesitate to join his allies in the battle. However, severe self-loathing persists due to the extent and nature of the crimes HYDRA forced him to commit, to the extent that he recognized that John Walker was dangerously unstable and unfit for the mantle of Captain America, long before the Super Soldier Serum and Lemar Hoskins' death caused Walker to become unhinged, purely because he saw aspects of himself in Walker.

Despite the years of brainwashing, Barnes still contains many elements of his old self, being rather old-fashioned on his first date with Leah, presenting her with a bouquet of flowers, as well as later confessing to Sam Wilson that he still listens to the 40s era music. Barnes holds a deep personal connection to Captain America's Shield, stating that it's the closest thing that he has left to a family. He is deeply hurt after finding out that Wilson has given the shield to the Smithsonian Institution, and that Walker has subsequently taken the mantle of Captain America. The legacy of the shield is what ultimately causes Barnes and Wilson to cross paths once again. Barnes initially confronts Wilson on several occasions, directly criticizing him for surrendering the shield, believing that he has disrespected and discarded Captain America's legacy like it was nothing. Barnes later confesses that the reason why he has initially pressured and blamed Wilson for giving up the shield was because it made him question Rogers' decisions, as well as his own. 

Regardless of their many differences, Barnes has developed a close bond with Wilson during their struggle against the Flag Smashers, with Barnes later voluntarily helping him fix the Paul & Darlene family boat, and with Wilson subsequently inviting Barnes to sleep over at the Wilson Family Residence. After helping him practice throwing the shield, Barnes sincerely apologizes to Wilson, stating that he now realizes the pressure that Wilson was under after Rogers initially gave him the shield. Barnes also confesses about his nightmares, showing his newly developed trust in Wilson.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Artificially Enhanced Physiology: Barnes was one of the recipients of HYDRA's Super Soldier Serum. There were no apparent effects at the time of his rescue by Steve Rogers, but the changes the serum caused in Barnes' body were sufficient to let him survive a plunge into an icy river at the bottom of a fall that should have killed him. According to the Smithsonian Institution, Barnes was already "an excellent athlete." Like Steve Rogers, he too has early levels of superhuman conditioning, due to his enhanced physiology. He was also equipped with a titanium arm capable of deflecting bullets and was later given a new vibranium arm after losing his original one.
Enhanced Strength: As a result of the Super Soldier Serum, Barnes' physical strength is enhanced to the early levels of a superhuman condition. The superior strength afforded by his metallic left arm aside, Winter Soldier's innate superhuman physical might alone rivalled that of Captain America's, able to use his legs and right arm to deliver strikes of exceptional force that can casually incapacitate and launch his opponents flying several meters away, through walls and knock them out even while holding back not to kill them. He was quite capable of affecting and hurting Rogers with blows from both his normal hand and legs. Barnes was also able to match Black Panther in his suit in terms of strength, and manage to hold his attempts to kill him at bay. Barnes also proved able to easily handle the Flag Smashers, who were similarly enhanced by the Serum, with only his natural strength, as shown by how he knocked down a Flag Smasher with a leaping punch during the Chase of the Flag Smashers and staggered another with a punch and during the Ambush at Latvian GRC Resettlement Camp, he easily launched a Flag Smasher flying through the air, knocked him out with two kicks, and quickly stunned and lifted another off his feet and tossed him to the ground. Later on, his enhancements and cybernetic arm afforded him the strength to effectively fight against John Walker, who was not only a Super Soldier but also already physically fit and athletic, able to hurt and make him bleed with his blows, hold Walker when he tried to use the shield to hit him in the chest to a stalemate, and help Wilson to disarm him by firmly restraining him for Wilson to successfully rip away the shield, before easily stunning him with a punch to the face and man-handling him for Wilson to deal the finishing blow.
Enhanced Durability: Winter Soldier's bones and muscles are denser and more resilient than a normal human's. Barnes even managed to survive a fall from immense heights into the Danube River in the Swiss Alps that his comrades, unaware of his enhancements, believed to have been fatal. Further experimentation by Arnim Zola's greatly fortified his physique; to the extent that he routinely leaps from significant heights onto hard surfaces and lands without any apparent injury. Bucky was able to leap off a bridge onto the top of a car below, crushing the roof and shattering the windows while he was unfazed by the landing. He was also able to withstand blows from various opponents that would have seriously injured or killed an average person. Winter Soldier also withstood getting brutally hit by Iron Man and his energy blast, and while in Munich, survived crashing through a forest whilst falling from an approximate 200 feet drop and withstood crashing through a forest during it.
Enhanced Speed:      Barns catching up with a truck   Winter Soldier's speed is tremendously enhanced beyond the peak of human potential, moving into the early levels of superhuman condition. Barnes' speed is equal to both Black Panther and Captain America, as he was able to stay ahead of them with a slight head start and match their speed in combat, countering their attacks and delivering his own. When fighting the similarly enhanced Flag Smashers, Barnes was also displayed repeatedly to be able to easily handle the Flag Smashers in combat. He was able to match and surpass their speed to deliver several powerful blows that quickly defeated them, easily kick one down before they could react and intercept a Flag Smasher before he could hit Wilson, and outrun them to stop them from attacking Wilson and Walker. He also proved able to stay in combat with John Walker after he had taken the serum, being able to keep up with and deliver blows of his own even when Walker was using his shield to block, giving him trouble dodging his attacks, intercepting him from killing Wilson, eventually easily managing to move faster than Walker and man-handle him before he could attack him. Barnes was also able to overtake and catch up to a speeding truck during the event Chase of the Flag Smashers.
Enhanced Agility: Winter Soldier's enhanced agility surpasses that of normal human capabilities, surpassing even Olympic gold medalists. Barnes can leap higher and further than normal humans, being able to leap onto the doors on a speeding truck during the Chase of the Flag Smashers, as well as quickly leap on top of midsize cars in a single bound while running. Barnes is also able to perform complicated acrobatic flips in order to avoid gunfire and to quickly dive into cover.
Enhanced Stamina: Winter Soldier's musculature produces far fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human, allowing him to exert himself at peak capacity for hours before tiring. Hence, he could endure the Clash of the Avengers and the later showdown at the HYDRA Research Base without showing signs of fatigue. Barnes, alongside Sam Wilson, was able to participate in the Ambush at Latvian GRC Resettlement Camp against the Flag Smashers, then go on to fight John Walker, all of whom had also been enhanced by the Super Soldier Serum, and by the end of it was still strong enough to walk away from the fight.
Enhanced Reflexes:     Winter Soldier catches a knife in mid-air   Winter Soldier's reflexes are enhanced. His reflexes are responsive enough to catch Captain America's shield being thrown at him at a high velocity. He was also able to catch enemy grenades thrown at him, as well as projectiles such as knives and poles, dodge fire from Falcon's Steyr SPPs, and leap on top of a moving car accelerating towards him with pinpoint accuracy. His reflexes are also fast enough to dodge or block Captain America's shield attacks and Black Panther's slashing attacks with hooked and clawed fists. It also helps him to catch objects that are hurled towards him. He was able to catch a knife thrown at him as well as catch a metal pole thrown at him by Karli Morgenthau with deadly force.
Regenerative Healing Factor: Winter Soldier's body is able to heal with extraordinary speed and efficiency, at a rate well beyond that of a regular human being, however he is unable to regenerate missing limbs. This may be one of the factors of his survival from the Swiss Alps. His healing has also allowed him to quickly recover from injuries received in battle; the injuries he had received during combat with Iron Man healed in a matter of days without bruising or scarring. In the span of a single day he was able to fully recover from the vicious wounds he suffered from fighting John Walker with ease without any lasting bruises or scars.
Longevity: As a result of the Super Soldier Serum, Barnes ages at a much slower rate than the normal human, a trait he shares with fellow super soldiers Steve Rogers and Isaiah Bradley. Barnes' lifespan has also  been artificially extended by being frozen in a Cryostasis Chamber; allowing HYDRA to weaponize him for many generations by keeping him frozen between his missions. He is currently over 100 years old, but retains the appearance of an adult man at his prime.
