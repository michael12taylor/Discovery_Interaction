Xu Wenwu (Chinese: 徐文武) was a legendary and nearly mythical figure who rose to power after discovering a set of mythical rings, and founded the army known as the Ten Rings. Wenwu established himself as a powerful warlord who conquered kingdoms over the millennia, the rings' power halting his aging process. In the modern-day, Wenwu continued seeking power, finding the ancient city of Ta Lo. He fell in love with Ta Lo's gatekeeper, Ying Li, and fathered Xu Shang-Chi and Xu Xialing. Despite swearing off violence to raise his family, Wenwu eventually reclaimed his rings when Ying Li was murdered at the hands of the Iron Gang. He trained Shang-Chi to be an assassin to avenge his wife's murder. However, Wenwu's two children would grow fearful of their father and eventually abandon him.

In the 21st Century, Wenwu discovered that Aldrich Killian appropriated the legend of the Ten Rings and had Trevor Slattery to impersonate Wenwu himself, giving him the Mandarin moniker. Enraged at Slattery's portrayal of him, Wenwu had him abducted and sentenced to imprisonment for tarnishing his name. Eventually, Wenwu would begin hearing his late wife's voice, urging him to free her from imprisonment in Ta Lo. Wenwu sought out his children to aid him, only for Shang-Chi and Xu Xialing to reject his request, siding with Ying Nan to stop his army. Through his attempts to rescue his wife, Wenwu unintentionally unleashed the Dweller-in-Darkness. In his final moments, Wenwu passed the Ten Rings down to Shang-Chi, before the Dweller drained his soul and killed him.

Biography
Early Life
Legendary Warlord
Around one thousand years ago, Xu Wenwu discovered ten mysterious rings which gifted him with unmatched power and immortality. Possessing the power of the rings, Wenwu became a powerful warlord and founded the organization, known as the Ten Rings. Wenwu's past was shrouded in mystery, but his followers had described him as being an ancient warrior-king that has inspired generations of men since the Middle Ages.

As the leader of the Ten Rings, Wenwu had become a myth to his followers, with only his most trusted men being aware that he really exists. He eventually became synonymous with the moniker known as the "Mandarin", which was an ancient Chinese war mantle, meaning "advisor to the King". Although Wenwu was rather dismissive of the moniker, due to its association with mandarin oranges, it became strongly associated with his persona, even among his own subordinates.

Ten Rings' Crusades
Having established his name as a legendary and feared warlord, Wenwu traveled across Asia, building the power of the Ten Rings and conquering whatever lands he desired. Wenwu would lead his army to a castle, where the armies defending it, stood in fear as Wenwu approached alone, on horseback. As a sea of arrows were fired at him, Wenwu unleashed the power of his Ten Rings, blocking the arrows as he charged forward.

With the power of his rings, Wenwu launched himself through the air, and landed in the middle of the defending army, as he swiftly used the power of his rings to obliterate his enemies. Keeping his foes at bay, Wenwu eventually launched a massive power strike from his rings, which blew through the apposing army and obliterated the gateway into the castle. Wenwu and his army were swiftly victorious, and had claimed the castle in the name of the Ten Rings.

Wenwu watches Ten Rings soldiers training
Wenwu and his army would take control of another facility, which would become the Ten Rings Headquarters, where Wenwu would continue ruling over the Ten Rings, observing his army of soldiers training. Through the few hundred years, Wenwu would use his army's to continue building his power, as they assassinated their enemies and conquered more of the globe. However, despite the immense power he had gained, Wenwu would never be satisfied, and continued seeking more power.

Search for Ta Lo
In 1996, Wenwu, not yet fully satisfied with his power, seeked out the village of Ta Lo, said to contain various mythical beasts, to expand his powers. Despite the forest itself attacking him and his men, he made it to village’s entrance, where he encountered a woman named Ying Li, who guarded the entrance to Ta Lo. She and Wenwu engaged in a fight, where she displayed her own impressive combat skills, but the two immediately began to fall in love.

Reunion with Ying Li
Having fallen for Ying Li, Wenwu returned where they would have dates at that same location and eventually fell in love. However, the villagers of Ta Lo would not accept Wenwu, fearing his past sins would have destroyed the village. As a result, Ying Li decided to leave Ta Lo with Wenwu.

Fleeting Peace
Wenwu eventually married and had two children with Ying Li: a son named Xu Shang-Chi and a daughter named Xu Xialing. For a time, Wenwu settled down with his family, loving them enough to set aside his terrorist empire and even forsake the power of the Ten Rings in order to be with them. During this time, Wenwu and Ying Li had attempted to return to Ta Lo and live in peace there, however, the elders of Ta Lo, led by Guang Bo turned them away, claiming that Wenwu's history with the Ten Rings would destroy the peace of Ta Lo.

Losing his Love
One evening, Wenwu had left his home, leaving Ying Li to look after their children, as she would train Shang-Chi in the ancient fighting style of Ta Lo. However, once Wenwu had returned to their home, he discovered a scene of destruction, with Shang-Chi and Xu Xialing standing among the chaos. Wenwu discovered that the Iron Gang had come searching for him to get revenge for his past actions, and had proceeded to murder Ying Li when they could not find him.

Wenwu was devastated by the loss of Ying Li, and returned to his room to grieve. Once Shang-Chi had come to speak to his father, Wenwu had been staring at his Rings, noting that this would never have happened if he had been wearing them, as the Iron Gang would had not dared to challenge him. Wenwu then accused Shang-Chi of standing back and doing nothing but watch as his mother was killed. With that, Wenwu decided to put the rings back on and seen his revenge for Ying Li's death.

Ten Rings Return
Massacre of the Iron Gang
Wenwu bringing Shang-Chi on his mission
Enraged by the death of Ying Li, Wenwu made the choice to put all the rings back on, and seek out his revenge. To this end, Wenwu tracked down the members of the Iron Gang who had invaded his home and murdered his wife. Upon finding them, Wenwu brought Shang-Chi with him, so that he could witness him avenging his wife, as Wenwu and Shang-Chi calmly entered the bar where the Iron Gang had been hiding.

Wenwu furiously attacking the Iron Gang
Letting go of Shang-Chi's hand, Wenwu stepped over to the table where the Iron Gang were enjoying their drinks, as he proceeded to power up his rings, and smashed his fist through the table, obliterating it and shocking the men. Before they could even react, Wenwu proceeded to slaughter the Iron Gang, using the power of his rings to launch them right across the room with incredible force, all while Shang-Chi watched with shock, stepping aside as Wenwu launched a man into the wall beside him.

Wenwu brutally kills the final gang member
With the final wounded gang member lying by Shang-Chi's feet, Wenwu stepped over to him with his rings powered up, as Wenwu demanded to know where the Iron Gang Leader was so that he could kill him. However, as the gang member insisted that he did not know, Wenwu proceeded to kill him with a blast of energy to the head, all while Shang-Chi watched on. With his revenge partly satisfied, Wenwu then took Shang Chi's hand and left, while planning how he would find the gang's leader.

Training Shang-Chi
Although he avenged Ying Li's death with the slaughter of the Iron Gang, Wenwu was still left with an emptiness, so he chose to rededicate himself to the Ten Rings, choosing to continue wearing his Rings at all time. Wenwu also decided that he would have Shang-Chi trained to become a warrior for the Ten Rings, although he had also chosen to not have Xu Xialing trained, since Wenwu only wanted male warriors to fight in his armies.

Wenwu and Death Dealer train Shang-Chi
To assist in Shang-Chi's training, Wenwu recruited Death Dealer, as he observed his son being trained to fight with the same foricity as the other Ten Rings warriors, training him with blades, as well as his own fists. Wenwu would also stand by and watch, as Shang-Chi was forced to punch a thick wooden bar repeatedly, with Death Dealer striking him with a stick if he began to relent due to the pain. Wenwu watched on, as Shang-Chi would punch the wooden bar for hours, leaving his knuckles bleeding. 

Wenwu offering Shang-Chi some advice
Eventually, Wenwu approached Shang-Chi following hours of him punching the wooden bar and invited him to take a break. Retiring to his room, Wenwu cleaned the blood from his son's knuckles, promising that the pain would go away and he would eventually be stronger for it. As they were speaking, Wenwu noticed that Shang-Chi was looking at his Rings, as Wenwu noted that they had brought their family strength, and now Shang-Chi would have to prove himself to be strong enough to wear them himself.

Stark Industries Technologies
In 2009, the Ten Rings struck a deal with Obadiah Stane which involved purchasing the illegal Stark Industries weapons. The Ten Rings ambushed the United States Air Force convoy in Afghanistan and kidnapped Tony Stark, imprisoning him in their base, attempting to force him into making them weapons for them. However, Stark made a suit of armor and escaped. Stane later betrayed the Ten Rings and had Raza as well as multiple of his men killed.

Wenwu targeted Stark and attempted to have him assassinated by using Ivan Vanko, sending his agent to arrange passage for Vanko to Monaco, although this failed. Over the next year, the Ten Rings suffered numerous defeats at the hands of Iron Man, as Wenwu ordered his men to capture James Rhodes and his new armor. Although Rhodes managed to defeat the Ten Rings, to Wenwu's frustration, his men managed to obtain a valuable information needed to take Iron Man down.

2012 Copycat Attacks
In 2012, Aldrich Killian orchestrated the series of terrorist attacks against the United States of America, using the moniker of Mandarin. However, Trevor Slattery who portrayed Mandarin, completely twisted the legend of "the Mandarin", which absolutely infuriated Wenwu, who planned to reclaim his name. After Killian was defeated by Iron Man, Slattery was arrested and imprisoned in the Seagate Penitentiary, and Wenwu sent Jackson Norriss to break Slattery out and capture him.

Disguised as a documentary filmmaker, Norriss successfully infiltrated the prison and abducted Slattery into the Mandarin's custody. Norriss explained to Slattery the legend of the Mandarin, and had sworn that Slattery would suffer greatly for the insult done against him. Norriss kidnapped Slattery and brought him to Wenwu himself who was intended to kill him, however, in the last moments, he witnessed Slattery's actor performance and changed his mind. Wenwu decided to keep Slattery as his personal "court jester" and  imprisoned him at his headquarters.

Completing Shang-Chi's Training
Wenwu watches Shang-Chi's combat skills
Once Shang-Chi was older, Wenwu would observe him as his warriors trained his endurance, striking him with staffs, while Shang-Chi remained strong and barely reacted. Finally, Wenwu had a dozen of his Ten Rings warriors attack his son with blades, only for Shang-Chi to prove himself as the superior warrior, being able to disarm all of his opponents with relative ease, coming out as the victor in the fight, much to the considerable satisfaction of Wenwu, who had been observing the entire clash, alongside Death Dealer, with Wenwu confirming that Shang-Chi was ready to become a member of the Ten Rings.

Shang-Chi's First Mission
Once Shang-Chi was fourteen years old, Wenwu decided that he would send him out to assassinate the leader of the Iron Gang, and thereby avenge Ying Li's death. However, despite completing his mission, Shang-Chi failed to return to the Ten Rings Headquarters, and chose to hide himself from Wenwu.

Defection of Xu Xialing
Following Shang-Chi's disappearance, Xu Xialing would eventually defect from the Ten Rings as well. Wenwu used his vast resources to easily track down his children, but respected their decision to leave the Ten Rings and instead kept a close eye on them in their self-imposed exile.

Family Reunion
Searching His Children
Over the next few years, Wenwu began hearing a voice inside his head, which was the voice of Ying Li, calling for Wenwu come rescue her. Believing the voice, Wenwu communicated with the voice and determined that Ying Li had not actually been killed by the Iron Gang, and was instead being held captive in Ta Lo. As a result, Wenwu had determined that he would go to war with Ta Lo and rescue Ying Li, determined to reunite his family.

Knowing that the way into Ta Lo was almost impossible to navigate, Wenwu realised that the way to find the path would be to use the Eyes of the Dragon, which would show him the pathway into Ta Lo. However, Wenwu had realised that these eyes had been given to Shang-Chi and Xu Xialing before Ying Li's death. Wenwu ordered the Ten Rings to track down his children, tracking Shang-Chi down to California, as he sent Razor Fist and Gao Lei to find him and reclaim the Eye, with them completing their mission following a duel with Shang-Chi.

Attack on the Golden Daggers
Wenwu being reunited with Shang-Chi
Wenwu had then tracked Xu Xialing down to the Golden Daggers Club, as he and his soldiers led an attack on the club in order to obtain her part of the Eyes of the Dragon. While Razor Fist and Death Dealer led the attack, chasing down Xialing and battling Shang-Chi who had come to aid his sister, Wenwu stayed back, until he and his soldiers had successfully captured Xialing and Katy Chen, as he then found Shang-Chi battling Death Dealer.

Stepping into the fight, Wenwu used his rings to grab Shang-Chi's arm and throw him back, revealing that he had already captured Xialing and Chen. Wenwu then told Shang-Chi that he had already told the Ten Rings that they would not have been able to kill him if they tried, noting that he was glad that Shang-Chi had proved him right by surviving. Wenwu then told Shang-Chi that it was time for them to return home, as he and Shang-Chi rested their foreheads together and left the club.

Returning to Headquarters
Wenwu bringing his family to their home
Returning to his Helicopter, Wenwu took his family and hostages back to their Headquarters, as his army of Ten Rings soldiers stood by and bowed to Wenwu as he arrived, as Wenwu looked to Shang-Chi to see his reaction to their greeting. Wenwu then allowed his children to explore their former home again, with Shang-Chi looking at his old training post, while Xu Xialing took Katy Chen to view her former bedroom.

Wenwu discusses Trevor Slattery's insults
Wenwu invited the group to join him for dinner, where he asked Chen what her true Chinese name was, expressing the importance of their names. Wenwu went on to tell the group his true name, noting that the only person who used to use that name was Ying Li. Continuing with this thought, Wenwu told them about how Aldrich Killian had stolen his name, by recruiting Trevor Slattery to take his name and the name of the Ten Rings and used it as a cover for Killian's terrorist actions.

As they listened, Wenwu explained that neither Killian nor Slattery had actually known of his true name, so they had been forced to come up with their own name, calling Slattery's imitation of him the "Mandarin", noting that this plan had worked, and that the United States of America had become terrified of a fake terrorist, named after a chicken dish as well as an orange.

Revealing the Secret Map
Wenwu discusses Ying Li's voice messages
Wenwu explained to his guests that Ying Li had been seemingly speaking with him, which Shang-Chi had refused to believe, leading to Wenwu promising to prove it to them. Wenwu brought them all into his office, as he explained that he had been working there when he heard the voice of his late wife, claiming that she was still alive and had actually been imprisoned within Ta Lo, as she begged for Wenwu to come and save her. However, Shang-Chi and Xu Xialing remained unconvinced, insisting that their mother was dead.

Determined to prove this to them, Wenwu took his family to a sculpture of the Great Protector, where he placed the Eyes of the Dragon, causing water to be shot out around them, only to freeze in time, much to the amazement of Shang-Chi. As they watched, the water then fell on the ground and created a map, which Wenwu explained was the secret pathway into Ta Lo. Wenwu told Shang-Chi and Xialing that he intended to follow this path and attack Ta Lo, with the intention of rescuing his wife from them.

Despite him showing that he had the support of the Ten Rings behind him, as his warriors held up their Hooked-Swords in salute of Wenwu, Shang-Chi insisted that they could not attack Ta Lo, claiming that there was no way that their mother was alive, and Wenwu would be committing genocide for no reason. Enraged by this, Wenwu proceeded to use his rings to throw Shang-Chi, Xialing and Katy Chen to the ground, ordering Razor Fist to take them into their prison cells while they prepared for war.

Preparing for War
While Wenwu was watching the monitors of the Ten Rings Headquarters, he witnessed Shang-Chi and Xu Xialing managing to steal a Car from their garage and escaping from the compound, having managed to get out of their cell, taking Katy Chen and Trevor Slattery with them. As Wenwu watched his children escaping him, he was rejoined by Razor Fist, as he instructed him to prepare for their mission, which Razor Fist agreed to.

Wenwu then prepared for the upcoming battle by wearing his armour, before sitting in his office, studying his books on Ta Lo. As he read, Wenwu heard the voice of Ying Li in his head, calling out for him to rescue her, as he turned to see a vision of Li and Xialing sitting together and smiling at him. The voice and vision further enforced Wenwu's determination to rescue his late wife from Ta Lo.

Wenwu was then snapped back to reality as Razor Fist had arrived at his office, and informed him that the Ten Rings were now ready for the mission, to which Wenwu confirmed that the pathway would be open by dawn. Razor Fist then agreed to prepare their squad of Jeeps for the mission to attack, as he left Wenwu to continue studying his books and preparing to battle the people of Ta Lo, and to rescue Ying Li.

Personality
A ruthless and calculating warlord, Wenwu led the Ten Rings with an iron fist, threatening his subordinates with death if they did not accomplish his orders, like when one of his agents failed in obtaining the War Machine Armor. His mystical rings gave him an insatiable hunger for power for centuries, aiming to be the Khan of the entire world. Nevertheless, Wenwu is not extremely cruel with his men: when his agent told him that he had got valuable information surrounding War Machine's battle suit, Wenwu simply spared him, demonstrating that he accepts any kind of useful progress on his plans. He also had great respect for the family, in a quest for power he met a woman named Ying Li, whom he married and had two children Shang-Chi and Xialing which led him to leave his cloak and focus on family life, but all that changed when a criminal organization called Iron Gang murdered his wife returned to his cloak to avenge her and take up the cause he thought he had left behind, training their children for their succession.

Having his style of leadership, Wenwu has demonstrated that he does not like to be imitated, being willing to punish those who had dared to impersonate him for their purposes. When the Mandarin fiasco engineered by Aldrich Killian incriminated the Ten Rings from Extremis-caused explosions and had Trevor Slattery posing as the leader of the Ten Rings, Wenwu resented them enough even after Killian died to the point of sending one of his most loyal agents to the Seagate Penitentiary to abduct Slattery. 

Wenwu showed somewhat of a dry humor when joking about how the fake name Killian came up with to impersonate him was ridiculous and found it funny that USA was intimidated "by a chicken dish" as well as "a Mandarin orange", similarly he decided to spare Trevor Slattery from execution after being amused by his acting performances, instead deciding to keep Trevor as a prisoner and make him a jester for his court on an occasional basis. 

Despite all, he greatly loved and cared for Ying Li, his late wife, and was willing to put side his organization away as living a normal life with her while raising a family. Ying Li was the best of him and the only woman he ever loved enough to become a better man and loving father. Sadly, her death caused him to take his position again and take vengeance on her murder. As a result, he became cold and distant towards his children, forcing Shang-Chi into a hellish training to become a dangerous martial artist while manipulating him, while also neglecting Xialing and not allowing her to train alongside her brother. In the end though, during the final moments of his life, his thoughts were filled with times he spent with his son, proving that his love for him ran true and deep.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings
Trivia
In the comics, the Mandarin is a would-be conqueror who came across ten Makluan rings, whose power he used to build a criminal empire. Using a combination of superhuman martial arts abilities, alien science, Chi manipulation, and the ten energy-blasting Makluan rings, the Mandarin wages a never-ending war on civilization. He was also one of Iron Man's greatest enemies.
Shang-Chi's father in the comics was originally Fu Manchu, a Chinese doctor and criminal mastermind, who was an adaptation of the character of the same name from Sax Rohmer's novels. When Marvel lost the comic book rights of Fu Manchu, the character was reinvented as Zheng Zu, a powerful Chinese sorcerer and leader of the Five Weapons Society.
Wenwu is named after the Chinese dual concept of wen (civil administration) and wu (martial administration).
One of the many aliases that Wenwu claimed he had been called was "Master Khan." In the comics, Master Khan is a villainous sorcerer from K'un-Lun and an enemy of Iron Fist who was killed by Namor. The alias "Master Khan" was also later used by the Mandarin in the comics.
Behind the Scenes
According to Jon Favreau and Jeff Bridges, the Mandarin was intended to be the primary villain in the first Iron Man. Kevin Feige revealed in an interview that early drafts of the film depicted the Mandarin as a younger individual, contemporary to Tony Stark, who would have business dealings with Stark Industries. Though this idea was eventually omitted to further push Obadiah Stane as the main antagonist of the film as opposed to the Mandarin, some of the traits for the character were incorporated into the character of Aldrich Killian in Iron Man 3.
The Mandarin was considered by Marvel Studios to be introduced in The Avengers alongside Shang-Chi in the post-credits scene as a tease for the Chinese market, but Beijing's development team shot down the idea as they didn't want the first Chinese character of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to be a villain.
Early versions of the story of Iron Man 3 featured the real Mandarin, but writer Drew Pearce suggested the idea that the film's Mandarin was an impostor during one of the writing sessions, conceiving the character that ultimately became Trevor Slattery. Director Shane Black detailed: "Who would be fool enough to declare that they're an international terrorist? If you're smart, whatever regime you're part of, you'd put a puppet committee and remain in your house".
David Callaham has stated that Wenwu does not use the title of "The Mandarin" himself: "Our version of the character is not The Mandarin in the way that people are expecting him to be. "The Mandarin" is a title that has been applied to him in the past by people that don't understand his culture. But he's a much deeper character than I think a lot of people would expect." Destin Daniel Cretton followed on from this by stating: "It was for me the part of the Shang-Chi comics that I personally really connected to. It was really important for us to find the root of that anger and that pain. That was the goal from the get-go, and probably the number one fear of all of us was creating a Mandarin that was further contributing to the "Yellow Peril" type of stereotypes that are still flying around."
Tony Leung revealed in an interview with GQ that he created a backstory for Wenwu in which he was a victim of domestic violence at the hands of his father and grew up without self-esteem as a result. Upon gaining superpowers, he wished to rediscover his self-esteem, though it caused him to become narcissistic and take his anger out on everyone else. These factors ultimately led to him being unable to love his children, due to his inability to love himself.
Leonard Sun was a stand-in for Tony Leung in the role of Xu Wenwu.
