T'Challa is the King of Wakanda and the eldest child of T'Chaka and Ramonda. As the Wakandan monarch, he became the holder of the Black Panther mantle. Following the death of his father in the bombing attack orchestrated by Helmut Zemo, T'Challa had set out to kill the Winter Soldier, who was widely believed to be responsible for the attack. During his attempt to find the Winter Soldier, Black Panther had joined a Civil War between the Avengers, where he sided with Iron Man. However, Black Panther eventually learned that Zemo was really the one who had been responsible for his father's demise, as he captured Zemo, handing him over to Everett Ross, while he also vowed never to allow desires of vengeance to consume him again.

Upon returning into Wakanda, T'Challa was officially crowned King, before he attempted to track down Ulysses Klaue, who had resurfaced after several years. However, T'Challa failed to capture Klaue and instead was forced to bring Everett Ross to the city to save his life. T'Challa's leadership was challenged when Erik Killmonger came into Wakanda, having killed Klaue and challenged T'Challa for their throne, as Killmonger bested T'Challa in a duel and took the crown. However, T'Challa had survived the duel and, with the help of M'Baku and his family, returned to Wakanda where he defeated Killmonger. Following the conflict, T'Challa returned to the United Nations as he had shared Wakanda's secret wealth with the rest of the world.

Black Panther was then called upon by the Avengers, as they had uncovered Thanos' plan to claim all six Infinity Stones and wipe out half of all life in the universe. T'Challa agreed to allow the Avengers to keep Vision in the city, where Shuri could remove the Mind Stone. However, Wakanda was then invaded by Thanos' forces, as Black Panther had led his army against Thanos and the Black Order, only for them to be overpowered as Thanos completed his goal and then wiped out half of life, killing Black Panther as a result. However, Black Panther was resurrected five years later by Hulk, as he then joined the Avengers in a final battle against an alternate Thanos, finally defeating the Mad Titan, although Tony Stark sacrificed his life for victory. Following this, T'Challa returned to his kingdom and reunited with his sister and mother.

Biography
Early Life
Raised in Wakanda
T'Challa was born in Wakanda, an isolationist country located in Africa, to the reigning monarch T'Chaka and his wife Ramonda. He eventually had a younger sister named Shuri. Training for all of his life to take his father's place as the next Black Panther, T'Challa grew into a man with a highly active mind and despite T'Chaka's best efforts, a great dislike for politics.

Becoming the Black Panther
In 2009, his father would pass the mantle of Black Panther to T'Challa after reaching a certain age.

One week after becoming the protector of Wakanda, T'Challa, as the Black Panther, was sent with Okoye to save Wakandan hostages from Zanda and Douglas Scott. Black Panther took on Zanda as Okoye retrieved the hostages, and was shot in the shoulder by her vibranium bullets. Before she could kill him, however, Zanda moved to shoot the fleeing hostages, giving Black Panther the chance to overpower her and ensure the hostages escaped. Once the police stormed the building, the mercenaries fled, with Black Panther deciding to pursue them in his aircraft. 

Following them to a yacht, Black Panther and Okoye took out the mercenaries and then confronted Zanda and Scott, with Black Panther killing Zanda by igniting one of her grenades and saving Okoye by dropping a metal bar on Scott's hands.

Avengers Civil War
Assassination of T'Chaka
T'Challa at the Vienna International Centre
When the United Nations decided to approve the Sokovia Accords in order to control and monitor the Avengers in the wake of the devastating battle between the Avengers and Crossbones, during which several Wakandan citizens were killed among other innocents. The Wakandan government chose to support the Accords as they felt the Avengers could become a true risk to the safety of Wakanda and the rest of the world considering their involvement in Ultron's creation.

T'Challa is introduced to Natasha Romanoff
T'Challa and T'Chaka attended the conference in Vienna, meeting Natasha Romanoff there. T'Challa spent time speaking with Romanoff where they had discussed the accords and their shared discomfort of such political meetings. T'Challa commented on the fact that the last time Romanoff was in such company, she had just exposed S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secrets during the HYDRA Uprising, claiming her dislike for politics made him happy to have seen her there.

T'Challa and T'Chaka both express their love
Being comfortable with Romanoff, T'Challa expressed his opinion on the accords, saying he approves of it but the politics were something he was not fond of, exemplifying two people in a room can get more done than a hundred. They were then interrupted by T'Chaka who had teased his son and greeted Romanoff, noting that Captain America had decided not to attend as he disagreed with the control the accords would put on his and the Avengers' actions. Once Romanoff had taken her own seat, T'Chaka then expressed his pride of seeing his son's skill at politics is getting better, thanking each other for their support during this difficult time for Wakanda's future.

T'Challa attempts to save his father's life
During the conference, T'Challa's watched as his father then gave a speech about Wakanda's dark history and unfortunate involvement in the creation of deadly weapons made with vibranium, using these as his reasons for signing the accords. Upon hearing the commotion outside, T'Challa realized danger was incoming but was too late to stop his father being killed in a terrorist attack that was orchestrated by Helmut Zemo under the disguise of the Winter Soldier. While the fire was being put out, T'Challa mournfully took his late father's ring and took over his rightful role as King of Wakanda.

Hunting the Winter Soldier
T'Challa vowing to kill the Winter Soldier
While considering his next actions, T'Challa was greeted by Natasha Romanoff who expressed her own grief at T'Chaka's sudden death and informed him the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre would decide who was responsible with apprehending Barnes. T'Challa, however, then informed Romanoff that he intended to find and kill the Winter Soldier himself.

Black Panther tracks down the Winter Soldier
T'Challa put on the Panther Habit in order to avenge his father's death. He then quickly managed to track the Winter Soldier down to where he had been hiding in Bucharest, where he fiercely attacked him. Despite being momentarily shocked by the arrival of such an unexpected enemy, the Winter Soldier quickly got to his feet and began fighting Black Panther but was overpowered by T'Challa's furious attacks.

Black Panther tries to kill the Winter Soldier
Using the incredibly sharp claws on his suit, Black Panther slashed at his enemy and tried to kill him, eventually pinning him to the ground and attempting to stab his target through the throat. When all hope looked lost for the Winter Soldier their battle finally stopped when a GSG 9 helicopter fired on Black Panther, with his own vibranium suit saving him. The Winter Soldier then attempted to escape by running off the side of the building, only for Black Panther to follow, grinding down the building's side.

Black Panther chases down Winter Soldier
While the Winter Soldier attempted to escape by running on foot, the Black Panther hunted and chased Barnes down through a long traffic tunnel, pursued himself by Captain America and Falcon who were now attempting to aid the Winter Soldier's escape. Determined not to allow the man who seemingly killed T'Chaka to escape, Black Panther charged through the tunnels, as his enhanced speed allowed him to run past cars as he began to gain on the Winter Soldier.

Black Panther gets a lift from Captain America
When Rogers commandeered a GSG 9 car to try and catch up to Barnes, who was escaping on a stolen motorbike, Black Panther jumped onto the back of the car to gain extra speed as well as jumping on the back of Falcon and flying through the tunnel, trying several times to knock Barnes off the motorcycle he was riding but finding that Barnes' prosthetic arm gave him an advantage as he was grabbed by the throat, but T'Challa soon recovered.

Black Panther is arrested by the police
Eventually, Barnes reached the end of the tunnel and tried to use an explosive to block their way, only for Black Panther to leap through the blast and slice through Barnes' tires, causing his own bike to crash. Although Rogers stopped him from killing Barnes, they were all soon captured when War Machine and an entire police squad arrived and surrounded them, to which he unmasked and revealed himself as the King of Wakanda to the surprise of everybody.

Held by Everett Ross
T'Challa explains his own motives for revenge
The police apprehended them all, who were now fugitives due to the new Sokovia Accords. The group was then brought into Berlin in an armored car to await their own punishments for all the chaos they caused. Along the way, T'Challa explained to Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson the history of the Black Panther and why he had targeted Bucky Barnes, while he desired to avenge T'Chaka and vowed that Rogers would not be able to keep Barnes safe from him for long.

T'Challa being introduced to Everett Ross
The group arrived at the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre Building and were soon greeted by Sharon Carter and her boss Everett Ross while Barnes was locked up in a maximum security prison of the German anti-terror police force GSG9. T'Challa was also brought into their custody and saw Captain America's Shield and EXO-7 Falcon being taken away. When Rogers questioned what would happen to Barnes, he was told he would be questioned by Ross' own men before being taken away to begin his sentence, which T'Challa seemed to agree with. Ross then explained that while he was there, T'Challa would be provided with an office rather than a prison cell to stay in.

T'Challa speaking with Natasha Romanoff
While awaiting news on what would happen with the Winter Soldier at the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre Building, T'Challa was visited by Natasha Romanoff who expressed her surprise at his secret identity, citing that this now placed him under the Accords' jurisdiction. T'Challa noted he wanted to move on so he could take Barnes to Wakanda. As Romanoff claimed this would be unlikely, Everett Ross confirmed T'Challa had been granted Barnes' extradition.

Hunting Bucky Barnes
T'Challa sees the Winter Soldier's escape
T'Challa waited as Winter Soldier was questioned by Helmut Zemo posing as the psychiatrist Theo Broussard. However, while T'Challa, Everett Ross, and the Avengers watched the questioning unfold, the power was shut off. Sensing that a more sinister plan was unfolding involving the Winter Soldier, who may be attempting to escape, T'Challa then went to investigate the incident himself further.

T'Challa tries to stop Winter Soldier's escape
Heading downstairs as chaos was erupting throughout the building, T'Challa discovered the Winter Soldier had escaped and was fighting against Natasha Romanoff and Sharon Carter who had, in turn, tried to save Tony Stark from the Winter Soldier's fury. Charging in before the clash could prove fatal, T'Challa managed to save Romanoff from being strangled by the Winter Soldier and engaged in a one on one fight with his enemy, determined for him not to get to escape.

T'Challa tries to block Winter Soldier's attack
While they began to fight against each other, it was clear that T'challa was not scared and proved to be lethal as HYDRA assassin, although the Soldier was able to use his prosthetic arm to gain an advantage with strength, managing to knock T'Challa to the ground and tried to get away, although T'Challa soon got to his feet and reengaged with the Winter Soldier, seeing his Wakandan Royal Ring seemed to have some strange effect onto the Winter Soldier's prosthetic arm.

T'Challa loses sight of the Winter Soldier
T'Challa refused to allow his father's killer to escape and continued fighting, furiously striking against him before kicking him down the stairs. Once the pair continued their duel, T'Challa managed to gain the upper hand and knocked him off the balcony easily. However, losing sight of the Soldier proved to be a dangerous mistake as T'Challa leaped down to re-engage with his target, only to suddenly discover that the Winter Soldier had managed to get away.

T'Challa speaks with Natasha Romanoff
When T'Challa learned from his Attaché that the Winter Soldier had escaped from the building, seemingly with the help of Steve Rogers, he decided to use Wakanda's many resources to track him down. On his way out, he was stopped by Natasha Romanoff, who came close to fighting Ayo, his security chief. T'Challa spoke to Romanoff politely and explained his current plan, however, Romanoff offered him a new alternative, to join Stark's team of Avengers members in finding and capturing Rogers along with the Winter Soldier for Thaddeus Ross. Knowing that this would prove to be a much faster method of finding and killing his target, T'Challa agreed to join Stark's team.

Clash of the Avengers
Black Panther greets Captain America
Having joined Iron Man's side, Black Panther eventually found and ambushed Captain America at the Leipzig-Halle Airport, greeting Rogers with respect while Stark continued to argue about the Sokovia Accords while Spider-Man arrived and took away his shield to ensure that he could not fight back, as Stark tried to convince him to surrender himself over to the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre for interrogation.

Black Panther challenges Captain America
However, Rogers remained confident and had Hawkeye free him from Spider-Man's webbing and Ant-Man gave him back his shield. As Iron Man scanned the area, he spotted the Winter Soldier, who Black Panther attempted to go after, only for Rogers to stand in his way. When Rogers ignored T'Challa's warning to get out of his way, they engaged in a fierce fight, where the claws on his own Panther Habit caused permanent scratch marks on Rogers' shield.

Black Panther dodges an explosion
T'Challa teamed up with War Machine during the fight but they both proved to be bested by Captain America, who fought them both off while disarming War Machine's weapons. The fight was stopped when Captain America and Ant-Man used a Pym Particle Disk to enlarge and throw a large fire truck towards T'Challa, War Machine and Black Widow, much to their annoyance as both T'Challa and Widow managed to dodge the explosion while Rhodes was hit with full on the force, knocking him painfully backward.

Black Panther sides with Iron Man
As Rogers and the rest of his team attempted to make their way to the Avengers' Quinjet to make their escape from the airport, their path was soon stopped by Vision, who used the Mind Stone to block their path. T'Challa joined the rest of Iron Man's team as the two opposing sides later gathered up to charge against their former allies, T'Challa first targeted the man he was desperate to get revenge on and who was seemingly responsible for the terrorist attacks.

Black Panther tries to kill Winter Soldier
During the fight, Winter Soldier tried to convince T'Challa that he wasn't the one who murdered T'Chaka, but T'Challa only questioned why he had run away if he was innocent. He almost succeeded to kill the wrong suspect as he pulled away from his prosthetic arm and then attempted to cut his throat, but Wanda Maximoff intervened and stopped his claws from reaching Barnes, and threw T'Challa through a distance with her powers, hitting a jet bridge.

Losing his Targets
Black Panther is just saved by Vision
Later, T'Challa spotted both Captain America and the Winter Soldier attempting to escape with a Quinjet which was inside the hangar, but Giant-Man held him and all the rest of Iron Man's team back. When keeping Spider-Man, Iron Man and War Machine away from his team, Ant-Man kicked a bus at T'Challa, only to be saved at the last second by Vision intervening and blocking the bus with his own vibranium body.

Black Panther is challenged by Hawkeye
With Vision's help, T'Challa was able to elude Ant-Man to reach the Quinjet Hangar. Before he could do so, Hawkeye tried keeping T'Challa at bay by firing many of his explosive arrows directly at him. T'Challa dodged many of the arrows and caught two before they exploded right in his face, angering him enough to fight Hawkeye by showing him his vibranium claws unleashed from his own Panther Habit as the Black Panther prepared to fight his legendary attacker.

Black Panther fights and subdues Hawkeye
Seeing that his current fighting technique was not working and still attempting to ensure his ally's escape, Hawkeye turned his bow into a bo staff and introduced himself to T'Challa, since they had never been introduced before this point, with the latter replying that he did not care who he was fighting. The pair started fighting one another until T'Challa broke his staff in half and knocked Hawkeye out of the fight, before then continuing his pursuit to the Quinjet Hangar.

Black Panther once again loses his targets
Despite the best efforts of Vision to block them, Rogers and Barnes reached the hangar due to the Wanda Maximoff's interference. Panther came close to them, only to be stunned multiple times by the Black Widow's Widow Bite, allowing Rogers and Barnes to escape, despite T'Challa trying to get a hold of the Quinjet. Romanoff claimed she had only promised to help him find them but not kill. T'Challa was furious with her and he later reported her betrayal to Thaddeus Ross, who initiated a manhunt for her.

Capturing Helmut Zemo
T'Challa closely following Tony Stark
Having had a meeting with Thaddeus Ross on board the Raft prison where he had a top-secret meeting with Falcon, Tony Stark discovered the location of the now fugitives Captain America and the Winter Soldier. Once Stark had put on his Iron Man suit and went to find them, T'Challa secretly followed Stark while onboard his jet towards Siberia, where the Winter Soldier laboratory was located.

Black Panther learns of Helmut Zemo's plans
T'Challa then successfully infiltrated the building with the plan to kill Barnes; following close behind as Iron Man had made peace with Rogers. However, T'Challa overheard the conversation between Rogers and Helmut Zemo, in which he had confessed to killing all the other Winter Soldiers and admitted to framing Barnes for the Vienna bombing. Having learned this truth that he had been hunting the wrong person, Black Panther focused his efforts on Zemo himself.

Black Panther encounters Helmut Zemo
While Zemo rested on top of a hill outside the missile bunker, certain that he had succeeded in pitting Iron Man and Captain America against each other, T'Challa quietly confronted him. Zemo explained to T'Challa the reason for his crimes: his family had been among the casualties of the Battle of Sokovia and that he wanted to tear apart the Avengers as revenge. Zemo also admitted that T'Chaka's death was not intended and apologized for it, saying that T'Chaka was a good man and had a dutiful son.

Black Panther subdues Helmut Zemo
Recognizing his own rage in Zemo and seeing how vengeance had consumed not only Zemo but Stark and himself, T'Challa decided to spare Zemo and even stopped him from committing suicide, using his vibranium-protected hand to block the gunshot, telling Zemo he still needed to answer to the living for his crimes. Binding his prisoner, T'Challa reunited with Rogers and Barnes, telling Barnes that he had assets in Wakanda that could remove all HYDRA's programming in his mind. T'Challa then handed Zemo over to Everett Ross for his punishment.

King of Wakanda
Rescuing Nakia
T'Challa watches the news report for Wakanda
A week after his his father's death at Helmut Zemo's hands, T'Challa was preparing to be formally crowned king. However, T'Challa decided to retrieve Nakia from her current War Dogs mission as he wished for her to be present during his coronation. Picked up by Okoye in the Royal Talon Fighter, the two flew to Nigeria where Nakia was located.

T'Challa tells Okoye that he never freezes
Preparing for his mission and equipping his Panther Habit, T'Challa used one of the tablets to look at where Nakia and the missing Chibok girls are located, informed by Okoye where they're heading for the border of Wakanda. He was then given EMP Beads to disable their kidnappers' vehicles but before he was dropped down to the field, Okoye told him to not freeze when he sees Nakia, remarking that he never freezes.

Black Panther stealthily hides in the trees
Holding himself with a Wakandan pose, T'Challa was dropped down by a chute hole on the ground of a Royal Talon Fighter, diving in the air and looking down to see the Boko Haram group driving to their destination. T'Challa sends EMP beads downward onto their trucks, immediately delivered a powerful EMP which forced all the vehicles to stop and made them unable to start again. Taking the opportunity, T'Challa landed onto a tree and stealthily wait until traffickers approached him.

Black Panther fighting human traffickers
As the traffickers noticed the trucks were hit by an EMP, they regrouped by splitting each other up in one location until one of them found a dog barking and suddenly T'Challa was spotted and began to attack the man by sending him off and hit a car door, instantly knocking him down. T'Challa then began to fight against several traffickers with guns shooting at but was impervious to bullets, leading to him defending off of them one by one.

Black Panther greeting Nakia on his mission
While taking down multiple men, T'Challa took attention to the particular one who was shooting at him, ready to kill on sight, Nakia stopped him and told that the shooter was just a boy and was kidnapped alongside the women who were as well. T'Challa took a moment to look at Nakia, having her attention only to simply greet her. Wanting to talk to her, T'Challa was interrupted by another man, threatening to shoot one of the women, only for him to get killed Okoye.

T'Challa invites Nakia to his coronation
Once Okoye killed the shooter with her Vibranium Spear, T'Challa was teased by her for his lack focused, leading him to freeze. T'Challa took off his mask and looked towards Nakia, she told them that they ruined her mission but T'Challa took it upon in urgency to tell her that his father was dead and is going to be crowned as King the next day. Nakia accepted his invitation and walked together in their Royal Talon Fighter, saving the kidnapped women and a child soldier.

T'Challa and Nakia relax inside the ship
Upon on the horizon, T'Challa and Okoye succeeded their mission and head on home to Wakanda with Nakia. As the sun rises from above, T'Challa was comforted by Nakia, as he was deeply saddened from his father's death. While getting together, Okoye announced their arrival as they flew by the border and into the holographic dome, reaching into Wakanda's capital known as the Golden City.

Coronation
T'Challa arrives at the Golden City
Upon arriving at Golden City, T'Challa was greeted by Ramonda and Shuri, who held great expectations for him as the new heir. As Nakia left to go to her tribe, Shuri asked Okoye if T'Challa froze during his mission, to which Okoye responded with a resounding insult, much to T'Challa's dismay of mockery. As the Dora Milaje left, T'Challa greeted Shuri for being on with him, asked for her EMP Beads, he was updated on a new habit only for him to be in disbelief, resulting into bantering with Shuri for her inventions.

T'Challa ask how Ramonda is feeling
T'Challa remarked at Shuri as she left with EMP beads that he can not wait for what update she would bring to her invention. Upon receiving a middle finger by Shuri, T'Challa asked how is she is feeling, to which she responded by saying she was proud, noting his father and her were talking about the coronation all the time, missing him, she told T'Challa that he is with them but now it was time for him to be crowned as King of Wakanda.

T'Challa prepares himself for his coronation
As the four of the tribes of Wakanda arrive the next day after a ceremonial celebration of the Prince's coronation, T'Challa prepares himself inside the Royal Talon Fighter and walks into the arena of Warrior Falls. Zuri came to explain the challenge and went off to give T'Challa a potion to let the powers of the Black Panther to be stripped away, leading him to feel nauseous, quickly recovered from it.

T'Challa accepts M'Baku's challenge
Once the challenge became fair, Zuri asked every tribe from any royal bloodline to fight for the throne, only for all of them to decline to challenge the throne, Shuri then raised her hand up and told Zuri that her dress is feeling uncomfortable and asked for her and the rest of the people to go home only to be mocked for the public. The Jabari Tribe led by M'Baku, arrived to challenge for the throne, ranting about how Wakanda has progressed and how the Prince of the country couldn't keep his father safe.

T'Challa battles against M'Baku in combat
While outright mocking T'Challa and his father, T'Challa willingly accepted M'Baku's challenge. As they prepare for their intense duel, T'Challa was put on a panther mask and was guarded behind by the Dora Milaje while M'Baku did it with his own tribe. They began to fight each other as they threw multiple blows that resulted in each other getting hit or dodging with each swing of their weapons.

T'Challa yelling at M'Baku to yield
As their fight began to be difficult towards T'Challa, M'Baku then broke his weapons during the duel, as they began trading blows only for T'Challa to be caught off guard in his grasp. Severely wounded, M'Baku was mocking him for being just a boy without his mantle, but his family cheered him off, leading him to fight back. Getting impaled afterward, T'Challa yelled at M'Baku that he is who he is and proceeded to remove the blade and attacked M'Baku with a chokehold.

T'Challa is crowned as King of Wakanda
Despite pinning him down, T'Challa decided to spare M'Baku, saying that his people need him, and yelling at him to yield before he would die. Once M'Baku forfeited, T'Challa took a breath to finally recover from his injuries. As the crowd goes wild with excitement and his family supporting him, T'Challa was crowned as King of Wakanda. Branding himself with Bashenga's necklace, T'Challa hugged Zuri as he thanked him as he was remarked as a King.

Visiting His Father
T'Challa participates in an ancestral ceremony
Following his challenge for the throne, T'Challa went to the cave where his ancestors gain the power of the Black Panther, with many women and children setting up the ceremony and getting the Heart-Shaped Herb for consumption. As T'Challa laid down on the sand, Zuri gave him the potion of the herb, letting him consume it. While manifesting his powers, T'Challa was buried deep into the sand, as his body began to quickly dissolve due to the side effects of the herb.
