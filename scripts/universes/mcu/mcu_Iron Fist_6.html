<html><p>Despite Temple's words, Rand remained insisted on killing Meachum. Wing noted she had been raised on the Bushido Code but wanted to kill Bakuto, only to be glad that Davos was the one who finished him off, otherwise, she would have spent the rest of her life wondering if she killed the man for the wrong reason. Wing reasoned that if Rand killed Meachum motivated by vengeance, his Chi would be corrupted and leaving him unable to access the Iron Fist. Wing told Rand, that she would kill Meachum for him, much to Temple's dismay as Temple urged them to start planning without ever killing anybody.

Rand considering another plan
Wing remembered Ward Meachum, since had he warned Rand about the DEA, he was an ally. At night, Rand secretly met up with Ward in a secluded alley inside New York City. Getting straight to business, Ward had informed Rand that the tablet had just been put in a safe box within the Rand Enterprises Building and only Harold knew the combination of it. Rand suggested that Ward should get Harold away from his office so Rand could get to the safe, but Ward warned Rand that Harold had hired and posted many guards outside the building making it impossible to get inside without being captured.

Rand accepts Ward Meachum's help
Rand asked why Ward was helping him and Ward replied that he was helping himself, as he wanted Harold taken care of as much as Rand, but Rand did not believe Ward's intention. Ward reasoned that one day on the run was nothing compared to a lifetime of abuse from his own father, to which Rand had then finally told Ward that Harold was responsible for the plane crash that killed his parents, as Ward was shocked and gave his sincere sympathies to Rand. When his trauma caused Rand severe stress again, Rand declared Ward that he would finally put an end to Harold once and for all before heading off.

Battle at Rand Enterprises
Rand gives Claire Temple a bag of cash
Outside the Rand Enterprises Building, Rand waited with both Claire Temple and Colleen Wing inside a car, as Rand then handed Temple the paper bag filled with all of the money which had been given to them by Jeri Hogarth to help complete their plan. They were then interrupted when Ward Meachum had called to warn Rand that they would have to enact their plan another night as Harold Meachum had posted guards on his office floor as well as downstairs. Before he could continue, however, the call was cut off as Harold had discovered Ward's collaboration with Rand.

Rand is worry about Ward Meachum's silence
Concerned for Ward, Rand insisted that they should continue with the plan; however, Temple noted that their plan was to wait until it was clear, jokingly noting that while it may be different in K'un-Lun, the opposite of clear in New York City was men with guns, insisting they should call the New York City Police Department.
Temple told Rand that he should not pretend that he cared about Ward because she knew that Rand was only thinking about his vengeance against Harold. Determined, Rand told them that he was going in and then got out the car and went into the building, followed by Wing.

Rand keeps himself at bay in the elevator
While Temple caused a distraction by using the cash to by a Peanut Vendor's car and blowing it up, causing a massive fire to start, Rand then managed to get past the first guards who went to investigate. Entering the building, Rand then quickly dispatched the guards with considerable ease before they even had a chance to react, knocking them both unconscious. Rand then took their cards and entered the elevator where he calmed his Chi; however, instead of heading to the office floor where Harold was waiting for him, Rand went to the roof in order to catch Harold and his guards by complete surprise.

Rand smashes through the glass window
As they had assumed he was still in the elevator waiting to ambush them, Harold ordered his guards to surround the elevator with their guns drawn, ready to shot down Rand as soon as the doors opened. Using this to his advantage, Rand had then summoned the Iron Fist, as Rand then used a rope to then swing towards the building and ambushed Harold in his office by smashing through the window. A furious fight had then ensued throughout the office floor as all the guards took Harold away towards safety and fought Rand. He was forced to take cover when they all started shooting at him.

Rand breaks the on-button lights in the room
Amidst the fight, Iron Fist found himself exposed when the guard he was fighting against was gunned down in the crossfire, so attempted to regain the advantage as Iron Fist had then darkened the room by smashing the on-button to the lights. As he took cover, Rand spotted Wing was on the floor as well, as she fought against Harold's guards with her Katana. Unable to get out from under the table as the guards had still continued shooting at him, Iron Fist had seen Wing ready to ambush Harold from behind only for Harold to then turn himself back around and point his gun directly at Wing, ready to shoot.

Iron Fist hits the ground to save Colleen Wing
Fueled by his love for Wing and his desperate need to save her, Iron Fist jumped out of his cover and summoned all the power he could muster into one fist. He smacked the floor and forced everyone up into the air in a powerful shock-wave of force that wiped the entire office floor, causing glass to fall out over New York City. Recovering from the shockwave, Harold had then quickly got back onto his feet and made his escape towards the roof. Rand made sure that Wing was okay before he headed off to follow and confront Harold, while Ward had also managed to get the Hand's tablet for Rand.

Showdown with Meachum
Rand takes cover from Harold Meachum
Giving chase to Harold Meachum, Rand realized that he had gone upstairs and continued following him until he had reached the roof of the Rand Enterprises Building. Rand looked for Meachum, who he knew was still armed with his gun and waiting for the perfect chance to shoot him, as Rand knew he was at a disadvantage as long as he could not get close. Opening the door careful, Rand charged across the roof, fast enough that Meachum did not have a clear shot.

Rand is wounded by Harold Meachum's gun
As he tried to take cover, Meachum then shot his gun and the bullet had pierced straight through Rand's fist, causing Rand considerable pain. While bandaging his hand with a cloth, Meachum then began taunting Rand, noting how the last time he had been on the roof was with Wendell Rand as they had overlooked New York City together, as Meachum had then admitted that he had always wanted to kill his closest friend and had desired to push him off the roof. Tormented by Harold's words and Rand's own conflict over his desire to kill him or take him to custody, Rand had tried hard to focus himself.

Rand hiding away from Harold Meachum
Taking advantage of the shadows, Rand had managed to land a kick against Meachum, but then ran into the shadows to prepare for his neck assault. Getting back onto his feet, Meachum expressed his regret at not killing Wendell and had blamed Rand for destroying his family. Enraged, Rand then told Meachum that he was wrong, as he affirmed that Meachum was the only one to blame for destroying his own family as well as the Rand's by causing the Plane Crash, while Meachum vowed that he would be focused on nothing else for the rest of his life, but getting his own vengeance against Rand.

Rand attempting to summon the Iron Fist
Getting the high ground, Rand had managed to get above Meachum as he leaped down and knocked him over, disarming Meachum as they two entered a fight, as Rand pinned Meachum onto the ground, only to discover that due to the gunshot wound he was unable to use the Iron Fist against Meachum. Seeing this, Meachum had mocked Rand, claiming that without the fist, Rand was nothing more than another screwed up kid. Meachum then took advantage of Rand's emotions to land a hard punch against him, which allowed Meachum to then get back onto his feet as he prepared himself to fight.

Rand fighting against Harold Meachum
While Meachum armed himself with a steel pole, Rand noted that he would rather die than live a life like Meachum's, noting how he was now utterly hated by everybody who was supposed to love him, like both Ward and Joy Meachum. These comments enraged Meachum as he furiously swung his steel pole at Rand who, only able to use one hand, had found himself at a sudden disadvantage as Meachum landed several strikes against him during their furious clash. While still being pushed back, Rand insisted that it was time for Meachum to face the truth, only to be struck in the face by Meachum.

Rand defeats and spares Harold Meachum
The hit to the face caused Rand to recall Madame Gao's words to him about his need to kill Meachum, while also recalling his training by the Order of the Crane Mother to become the Iron Fist, following the deaths of his mother and father. With a new sense of purpose, Rand got back up and landed several hits in quick succession, which resulted in Meachum getting impaled on a metal spike. While he was still heavily bleeding Meachum taunted Rand by asking for a hug and then urged him to finish him off, looking down at the spike which was now covered in his blood, as Rand still struggled emotionally.

Iron Fist blocking Harold Meachum's bullet
Following an intense emotional conflict within himself, Rand had then remembered his own trial against Shou-Lao, Rand finally understood that he would be no better than Meachum if he killed him. Regaining his conviction and making peace within himself, Rand declared that Meachum would soon be finally arrested by the New York City Police Department. As Rand turned away from him to leave, Meachum had managed to get off his impalement and had then attempted to shoot him. Colleen Wing appeared with Ward and warned Rand, so he had turned around and then deflected the bullet with the Iron Fist.

Rand witnesses the death of Harold Meachum
As Rand had looked closely at his hand, he discovered that not only had his Chi allowed him to block the bullet, but it had also healed the previous gunshot wound; however, Meachum had prepared himself to shoot at Rand once again. However, before Harold could continue shooting, Ward finished Harold off by shooting him repeatedly in the chest, which had resulted in Harold tumbling off the roof the building and fell several floors down to his death, as Rand and Wing watched on in horror, while Ward breathed a sigh of relief as he was finally free of his abusive father while also having saved the life of Rand.

New Goal
Return to K'un-Lun
Rand attending Harold Meachum's cremation
The next day Rand and Ward Meachum had then prepared for Harold Meachum to get cremated to prevent his resurrection. Ward thanked Rand for being there, claiming that despite everything, it was still his father's body and he did not want to do it alone. Rand had asked if there had been news from Joy Meachum but Ward replied that there was not. They were interrupted as Jeri Hogarth entered to inform Rand that in light of his innocence and his donation which he had recently made, the DEA agreed to drop all charges against him.

Rand listens to his testimony from Jeri Hogarth
Ward congratulated Rand but, feeling empty, Rand asked Hogarth what he should do now, to which Hogarth told Rand that he was free now. Ward offered Rand to return back to Rand Enterprises and run it together like their fathers should had done; however, Rand smiled and admitted that he was not a good businessman. Ward confessed that he would miss Harold since he had no one to blame for all his failures and weaknesses. Rand had consoled Ward and admitted he understood what he felt as he had experience it himself, before they both watched as Harold's body finally getting cremated.

Rand visits Colleen Wing at Chikara Dojo
Later in the day, Rand visited Chikara Dojo where he found Colleen Wing was training Claire Temple and Rand announced that he had brought pizza while Temple jokingly pointed out it wasn't like the last takeout, Rand said that he needed to learn something beyond what his father had taught him. Rand noted that Temple was keeping up with her training, Wing responded that Temple was her only student left. Rand had assured that Wing had a gift with trouble kids and he could get his company to sort a scholarship for her, which Wing had then promised that she would the idea some serious thought.

Rand tells Colleen Wing he'll go back K'un-Lun
Temple asked what Rand's plans were and he told them that after thinking about it, he planned to go back to K'un-Lun as he told them that he needed to explain to Lei Kung why he left to return to New York City, finally noting that it was wrong of him to leave the way he did as he had been told by Davos. Rand also said that he needed to complete his training, since Rand had realized that there was still so much he did not know about the Iron Fist. Before leaving, Temple told Rand and Wing that they shared a lot in common and they both needed some psychological help before walking out the dojo.

Rand invites Colleen Wing to go to K'un-Lun
Wing was saddened that Rand was heading back to K'un-Lun, while Rand had told her that he needed to figure out who he was going to be as the Iron Fist, noting how Kung had always told him that he was a weapon against his enemies such as the Hand, but Rand had come to believe that he could be something else, perhaps a light for those trapped in darkness. Wing told Rand that she would miss him while he was gone; however, Rand had then revealed that he hoped that Wing would come with him. Awkwardly awaiting her answer, Rand was overjoyed as Wing agreed to go and then hugged him.

K'un-Lun's Disappearance
Rand discovers K'un-Lun has vanished
Rand and Colleen Wing reached the Himalaya Mountains, while together they had carefully made their way through the deadly trek towards K'un-Lun. While Wing questioned how much further they had to travel until they reached K'un-Lun, Rand had then promised that it was not much further, noting that it would be much warmer in the city, and that he could almost smell to stew that Brother Rabten would keep going day and night. Reassuring Wing that she would love it there at K'un-Lun, Rand had also explained that they should arrive just in time for the afternoon kung-fu practice.

Rand vowing revenge on the Hand
When they reached the passage, Rand discovered that the mountain walls were now stained with blood as Rand realized to his complete horror that the Hand attacked the passage while he was still in New York City, finding to members of the Order of the Crane Mother lying dead before them, with the Hand's weapons lying around the frozen corpses. Rand and Wing went further and they found that the portal to K'un-Lun had disappeared. Angered over the realization that he has failed his duty, Rand gathered his Chi as the Iron Fist glowed in anger while Rand prepared to get his revenge on the Hand.

Duel of Phnom Penh
Iron Fist comes to save Shaft from Black Sky
A couple of months later, Rand and Colleen Wing had been following the Hand across many countries, hoping to gain a lead on what had happened to K'un-Lun; however, every lead they followed would almost immediately turn up dead. Their journey eventually led them over to Cambodia where they got the lead about Shaft, the member of the Chaste who had seemingly possessed information on the Hand. They then located Shaft inside the sewer where he was currently defending himself as he had been attacked by the Black Sky who was quickly gaining the advantage during the fight.

Iron Fist manages to subdue the Black Sky
Although Rand was then able to push the Black Sky away from the wounded Shaft, she continued to furiously attack him, managing to get past Rand and succeeded with mortally wounding Shaft before Rand and Wing could prevent it. While Wing tended to Shaft, Rand gave chase to the Black Sky, following her through the tunnels until he was ambushed by the Black Sky. Although she proved herself to be a deadly opponent and was briefly able to gain the advantage over him, Rand then used his Chi to summon the Iron Fist, striking her hard, which caused her to disappear into the shadows.

Iron Fist watches Shaft dying from his wound
With the Black Sky defeated for the time being, Rand had returned to Wing's side as attempted to assist Shaft; however, the wound proved to be fatal. Upon learning about Iron Fist's title, Shaft spoke with his would be rescuers and, with his dying breath, Shaft urged Rand to immediately return to New York City, as the war he was fighting was not in Cambodia. With this, Shaft succumbed to his injuries and died, as Rand cursed his frustration at another lead in their investigation having been lost before they get any real information, also frustrated that he had allowed the Black Sky to escape during the fight.

Return to New York
Rand examines his latest wound in the mirror
With no other option, Rand and Colleen Wing had then headed back towards New York City to see if what Shaft had claimed could indeed be true, knowing that with Shaft's death they had currently run out of leads with their investigation. During their flight on the Rand Enterprises Private Jet, Rand fell asleep and dreamed of looking in the mirror, examining the wound he gained during his clash with the Black Sky, touching the cut that ran across the Mark of Shou-Lao.

Rand is haunted by some more horrific visions
However, during his dream, Rand was also haunted by his failure to protect K'un-Lun, as he had a vision of stepping into a hallway where he was surrounded by the many bloodied corpses of the Order of the Crane Mother monks who he had failed to protect. When Rand then attempted to get away from the horror that surrounded him, he found himself blocked by a vision of himself, who openly blamed Rand for the fall of K'un-Lun and the deaths of his adoptive family whose own blood had painted the walls around him, much to the complete horror of Rand who then desperately begged for the visions to stop.

Rand being finally woken up by Colleen Wing
Finally Rand was awoken from his horrifying dream by Wing who had seen how much he was currently in distress, although Rand claimed that it was merely the turbulence which was disturbing him, claiming that he might never get used to the feeling following the Air Crash in the Himalayas. Although Rand tried to dismiss Wing's concerns, she noted that she heard Rand screaming in his sleep and demanded that he finally tell her what was on his mind. Sitting down, Rand then explained his frustration at finally getting a lead on the Hand, only to find him moments before Shaft was murdered before them.

Rand discusses the Hand's current schemes
Rand also expressed his annoyance at him allowing the Black Sky to get away, although Wing noted that whoever the Black Sky was, she moved faster and hit harder than anyone they had ever encountered before. Rand confirmed his belief that the Hand was responsible for killing the members of the Chaste, although Wing noted that could not be certain as Bakuto had kept a lot of secrets from her, claiming that the Hand would not just disappear without a fight. Rand then questioned what the Hand could possibly want in New York, but still Wing was unable to give any kind of answer to this question.

Rand and Colleen Wing returning in New York
Eventually Rand and Wing had arrived back in New York at night in a helicopter with the intention of continuing to go track down the Hand based on what Shaft had said to them moments before his demise. While onboard the helicopter, they discussed New York's reputation as the greatest city in the world, as Wing claimed it was a place that could be whatever they needed it to be. However, just as Rand and Wing got off the helicopter, they witnessed an Earthquake seemingly striking the City, causing the entire city to shake including several of the skyscrapers while Rand looked on in horror, suspecting that there was more to the Earthquake than a simply natural disaster.

War for New York
Encountering Luke Cage
They returned back to Chikara Dojo. Rand and Wing began planning on what to do. Having seen the Tsukamoto that Shaft used, Wing suggested that they go to a weapon workshop in New York to look for leads. At night they went to the workshop and found all of the occupants killed.

Rand furiously interrogating Cole Miller
A short while later a group of men entered the building. They hide themselves and observed as the men began cleaning the room and destroying the bodies. Rand and Wing attacked the men.

Rand has a conversation with Luke Cage
In the morning, Claire Temple arranged a meeting between Rand and Cage. There was hostility between them. Temple urged them to make peace and work together. Rand and Cage talked. Both managed to find some common ground with their pasts and their powers. Their conversation turned back to hostility when their conversation turned to Miller. Another argument ensued which caused Cage to leave the dojo. 

Defenders United
During his argument with Cage, Rand realized that he could use his privileges as owner of Rand Enterprises to fight the Hand's leadership instead of targeting their agents.

The Defenders brought Sowande to an abandoned warehouse. They interrogated him. During his attempt to escape, he held a knife to Rand's throat and revealed their plan. They needed the Iron Fist to destroy an indestructible stone that prevented them from reaching their goals.
Stick killed Sowande and prevented his escape.

The revelation caused tension in the group. Rand opposed their plan to keep him away. Their disagreement led Rand to fight his teammates. The fight ended when Jones knocked him out. The Defenders tied him to a chair to keep him from escaping. Cage and Stick stayed behind to watch over him while Murdock and Jones left to investigate the Hand. Rand woke up not long after and attempted to escape by gathering his chi to summon the Iron Fist.

Stick decided to kill Iron Fist to prevent him from getting captured by the Hand. He weakened Cage by tricking him into inhaling a poisoned smoke. Before the old man could kill Rand, Elektra attacked. During the battle, Rand fell unconscious due to inhaling the smoke. While he was unconscious, Elektra killed Stick, defeated the rest of the Defenders and then brought him back to the Hand.

Rand woke to find himself in the Hand's headquarter and faced Alexandra Reid. He stubbornly refused to aid them. He was then taken away to be brought down to the depths of the headquarter. Not long after, Elektra took him to the indestructible stone. Elektra explained that since an Iron Fist sealed the place with the stone and his Chi, only another Iron Fist can open it. Rand refused to open it, but Elektra tried to convince him by letting him off his tires. Rand used this opportunity to fight Elektra.

They fought fiercely against one another. Eventually Elektra angered Rand to the point that he summoned the Iron Fist. Elektra managed to led Rand to inadvertently opened the sealed door. They both crashed through the opened way and Rand found himself amidst the Dragon's bones.

Iron Fist and the Defenders prepare to fight
Rand tried to keep the Hand from mining the dragon bones. During his attempt, he was found by Madame Gao and was captured. The Defenders arrived to battle the Hand.

Rand told Griffith about his adventure into getting his title as the Fist when he fought Shou-Lao. Griffith was surprised that he fought Bruce Lee, however, Rand quickly corrected him by saying it was a real dragon but was interrupted by Cage.

Rand and Luke Cage spend time meditating
Cage insisted if Rand will stay and help him, he'll must play by his rules. Rand politely told Cage that he'll do just that with no problem as he likes to put up a good fight. After Rand put up a handshake, the two Defenders agreed to work together. Through meditation, Rand and Cage focused on the idea to take down Bushmaster by using silence. Cage wondered if it would have solved the problem. Rand told Cage that while he might be invulnerable, Bushmaster doesn't seem to have the same level of endurance as Cage and thus he must have been injured and seek out for medical aid.

Rand and Luke Cage walk down in the streets of Harlem
Cage has the idea to get to place where the Bushmaster has been getting Nightshade for his strength. Rand agreed with his idea and they proceeded to move out of the barber shop and into their target's current location.

Rand explains that it all has to do with staying still, Cage only excepts that the only thing he does is getting things done.

Agreeing with Rand's theory and knowing that their adversary must have sought someone unregistered, Cage brought him to Mother's Touch. When they arrived at the building, they found it wrecked and Tilda Johnson missing. Rand looks over the place and began discussing about the Chronic 2001, his favorite song, Cage wonders why is that his favorite, to which expresses that he downloaded it while boarding on the plane. Rand looks over to a poster to which reminded him of the teaches of self balance from the mind of the person. As they searched for clues, Rand theorized that since Bushmaster's powers come from Nightshade, he must be addicted to it. The two teammates concluded that Bushmaster must have sought for a way to keep growing more nightshades in order to maintain his powers and addiction. They both headed to Harlem's Paradise to search for Tilda's whereabouts.

Entering Harlem's Paradise
Rand and Luke Cage enter Harlem's Paradise
Rand and Cage arrived at Harlem's Paradise to question Mariah Dillard. While Rand was slightly worried about Dillard's goons, Cage assured that they wouldn't dare to harm him due to his status as a billionaire. Rand rebuttals that he no longer has kind of cash lying around him anymore and only resorts in his business. Cage told him that it doesn't matter as long as he had money, it only gets him respect and not just power. Dillard entered the room and looked both of them down. Mariah wondered why Cage decides to come back to Harlem's Paradise, Cage questioned Dillard about her daughter and found no answer. Mariah then noticed Rand and offers him a drink, Rand rejects her offer. Cage proceeded that if she sees her, she better care for her.

Teaching About Stillness
Rand talks about his experience in Columbia
Arriving at the location, Rand and Luke Cage stood near a balcony. Rand told him about his father who studied at Columbia University and brought him here at his childhood. Rand then attacked Cage with a strike and was impressed how calm he took the hit. Cage walked away and expressed that he did not had any time to spar with him.

Rand tests Luke Cage's focus on the job
Rand then jumped in front of him and told him that actually they had. They had a brief spar and Rand proved his point when Cage's anger made him unfocused and keeping his perspective narrowed. Rand expressed that in order to focus on the job in hand, he must stand still and try to find a perfect plan to figure out in the most logical way. Cage then realized that they need to find someone who knows what was happening in the streets. Knowing the right person to talk to, Cage and Rand searched for Turk Barrett.

Locating the Warehouse
Rand and Luke Cage meet Turk Barrett at his shop
After some difficulty finding him, they eventually managed to locate Turk Barrett at his pot shop. Rand allowed Cage to confront Barrett about how he has gotten into any criminal activities to which he replied that he hasn't been in for awhile. Barrett noticed Rand who introduced himself, however, Barrett already knew about him since Madame Gao's men was reportedly scared off from Barrett's business. Cage wondered if he noticed any new drug that has ever been seen but Barrett decided not to tell him. Rand noticed a dragon pipe that is used to smoke marijuana and expressed that he likes it. Cage asked does he smoke but Barrett interrupted him with asking about the certain drug he's talking about.

Rand talks to Turk Barrett about his Chi
Breaking one of his products, Cage proceeded to tell Barrett where this new drug is growing.

Rand and Luke Cage watch over the warehouse
Stylers arrived at the warehouse in a van and brought out the supplies for the plant they were about to make. Rand and Cage looked over the men at a distance. Rand proceeded to ask Cage about being calm and focused but Cage replied that he is already focused. The group of Stylers were in the warehouse with weapons as the plant was ready to be shipped. They then noticed noises coming out of the door. As the noises stop, Rand uses his fist to punch open the steel door and enter the warehouse ready to fight alongside with Cage.

Rand breaks into the abandoned warehouse
Rand and Cage found heavy resistance amongst the Stylers and proceeded to take them down and splitting up. Fighting together, both of them managed to defeat all of Stylers in the side-by-side hallways and striking each one. As they reach each other again, Stylers began to outmatch them by surrounding Rand and Cage. Cage had the idea of patty-cake, Rand replied in questioned. Cage explained by telling to fire up his fist and hit his hands. Rand summoned his Chi and hit Cage's hands, the force blast each one of the Stylers in one blow.

Rand takes down all of Bushmaster's men
Rand and Cage noticed two men confronting them and one of them pulled out a rocket launcher. Cage had an idea of using Rand to knock both of them out. Rand proceeded to be picked up and thrown while using his chi to knock out both of them. Successfully taken down all Stylers, Rand and Cage and locate the drug through the door. Cage was willingly about to open with his fist but Rand suggested to keep himself still. Cage agreed and opened the door properly. Rand and Cage found a purple-lit house and proceeded walk towards it and found an abundance of plants growing.

Rand and Luke Cage burned the warehouse
Entering in the growth house, Cage asked a man what are they trying to do with the Nightshades they were growing. The man answered his question and Rand picks up one of the plants and touches them to see if they died out.
