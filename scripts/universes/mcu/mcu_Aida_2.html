<html><p>Radcliffe Residence: Aida was built and was initially kept at the Radcliffe Residence, hidden behind a bookshelf when not in use. She helped to look after Melinda May after her near-death experience. Aida also murdered Nathan B. Nathanson and replaced May by an LMD, keeping the real May prisoner in the residence. As Holden Radcliffe was arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D., Aida was forced to abandon the Radcliffe Residence.
Playground: Aida was invited to the Playground along with Holden Radcliffe at the time when S.H.I.E.L.D. attempted to fight against Eli Morrow. Later, she also infiltrated the Playground in order to steal the Darkhold from S.H.I.E.L.D. After she gained a biological body, Aida was temporarily imprisoned in a Containment Module of the base, but she later escaped from her cell and began a rampage across the Playground, forcing the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to flee.

Superior's Submarine Base: To be added
Ivanov Oil Platform: Aida took the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents she had kidnapped into the Ivanov Oil Platform, where they were connected to the Framework. Aida occasionally also plugged herself to the Framework to monitor the advancement of the Project Looking Glass, which was meant to provide her with a biological body. She also arranged for Anton Ivanov and her men to set up the necessary equipment for the completion of the project, which was eventually successful. Having gained her new body, Aida teleported out of the facility with Leo Fitz, but later returned to help the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to save Alphonso Mackenzie from drowning.
In the Framework
S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy: In the life she wrote for herself in the Framework, Aida studied at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy, where she met Leo Fitz who would later become her lover.
Triskelion: Being the leader of HYDRA in the Framework, Aida, known as Madame Hydra, resided in the organization's headquarters, the Triskelion, and spent most of her time there. After she was heavily wounded by Daisy Johnson, she was forced to remain in her bed in her apartments, and could only escape from this condition by enacting the final phase of the Project Looking Glass.
