<html><p>Once they were alone in the Pym Residence hallway, Lang and van Dyne shared a kiss: However, they were quickly discovered when Pym then opened the door to find Lang kissing his daughter. Lang feigned innocence, claiming that van Dyne had kissed him; she didn't deny it, though it looked like he had kissed her. He quickly walked off to go have dinner at Maggie Lang's House with his family, as Pym called after him, for being a poor liar, something Lang did not even bother denying as he made his hasty departure.

Sought by the Avengers
Updated by Luis
Lang has dinner with Jim Paxton
Months later, Jim Paxton invited Lang to have dinner with the family so he could spend time with Cassie Lang, who had adopted the dog-sized ant as a pet, as payment for saving his daughter's life. During the meal, Paxton told Lang that he would not be arrested as it had been decided that a glitch in the system had caused his earlier release. Lang thanked Paxton personally for this action, knowing that it put his own career on the line, but Paxton insisted he was happy to do it to help out Cassie's father.

Lang learns that Falcon is searching for him
During the dinner, Lang received a call from Luis who wanted to meet with him. When Lang met with Luis, who was also there with Dave and Kurt Goreshter, he recalled that in his chain of contacts, someone informed him that Falcon was looking for Lang, due to being impressed with his skills in their brief fight and was now interested in recruiting him into the Avengers. Lang questioned what Luis had told his contacts and he explained that he had told them that he did indeed know the Ant-Man, much to Lang's great dismay at the news.

Recruited by Captain America
Lang wakes up in Berlin
Lang was recruited by Clint Barton during the resulting fallout caused by the Sokovia Accords, to support Steve Rogers and his team. Lang arrived in Berlin by van and was introduced to Captain America and the rest of the team, showing a great deal of excitement at meeting Rogers and Wanda Maximoff among others. He thanked Rogers for choosing him to assist during this skirmish, noting Rogers likely had other choices.

Lang is introduced to Steve Rogers
Lang apologized to Sam Wilson for the fight they had; Wilson was not angry, calling the fight a great audition and claimed that it would never happen again. Rogers told Lang that they were acting outside the law, but Lang did not refuse to assist him. Rogers then explained that they were going up against the Winter Soldiers who were going to be freed by Helmut Zemo and must be stopped before they could cause chaos across the whole world.

Clash of the Avengers
Ant-Man stealing the shield from Spider-Man
When Iron Man and his team approached Captain America in the Leipzig-Halle Airport and the situation escalated with Spider-Man taking Captain America's shield, Ant-Man used the distraction of the ensuing argument to sneak forward and stole the shield, kicking Spider-Man in the face before proudly handing the shield back to Captain America.

Ant-Man fighting against the Black Widow
While Iron Man and other members of the team charged after Rogers and other members of their team, including Hawkeye and Bucky Barnes, Lang was left face to face with Black Widow, noting that he really did not want to hurt her. The two began fighting regardless and Ant-Man shrunk down and attempted to twist Black Widow's arm around her back; however, she activated her bite which sent Ant-Man flying backward while she moved onwards.

Ant-Man attempting to assist Captain America
Catching up with Captain America, Ant-Man found what he thought was a water truck and shrunk it down, handing it to Captain America and telling him to throw it at one of his Pym Particles Disks. Captain America did just that and the truck returned to its original size, falling towards War Machine and Black Panther. However, it exploded upon impact, much to Ant-Man's surprise as he apologized to Captain America for his mistake before they made a hasty retreat.

Ant-Man running with Captain America's team
Rejoining Falcon and Wanda Maximoff among the other members of Captain America's team, Ant-Man attempted to run to the Quinjet to escape, but their path was then blocked by the Vision, forcing the two opposing teams to face off against each other. Following their leader's direction, Ant-Man followed his teammates as they charged forward and engaged in a fierce clash against the various heroes who had joined Iron Man's team supporting the Sokovia Accords, with Ant-Man once again fighting against Black Widow.

Ant-Man riding on one of Hawkeye's arrow
Having gotten away from Black Widow, Ant-Man teamed up with Hawkeye and they decided to take care of their opponent's leader in order to gain a much-needed advantage in this fight. Ant-Man took position on Hawkeye's Scatter Arrow, giving his approval and was propelled through the air to hijack Iron Man's suit, dodging shots fired from Iron Man's gauntlet's and diving through Iron Man's fingers and get within the suit itself and cause some mayhem.

Ant-Man disables the systems inside Iron Man
Once inside the suit, Ant-Man used his mechanical knowledge to greatly damage the suit's many weapons systems, mocking Tony Stark as he panicked and tried to understand what was happening, with Ant-Man claiming to be the voice of Iron Man's own conscience. Ant-Man continued the mission to damage the suit as much as possible, which he managed to do before Iron Man finally ordered F.R.I.D.A.Y. to use the suit's own extinguishing foam to force Ant-Man out.

Giant-Man Attacks
Ant-Man prepares to unleash the Giant-Man
As the fight progressed, Hawkeye then noted that unless something drastic happened, this showdown was looking like an impending stalemate. Captain America agreed, and Falcon asked the team for a distraction. Ant-Man chimed in that he had a possible idea, but had tested it only once in a laboratory, and the test had left him in rough shape.

Ant-Man transforms into the Giant-Man
Running out of options, Captain America did not object and Ant-Man let loose his distraction. Ant-Man got his adrenaline pumping as he jumped onto the back of War Machine and used the suit to grow into a monstrous size as he towered over the entire airport and grabbed War Machine by his leg, laughing maniacally at his success. Giant-Man reigned shock and mayhem on Iron Man's forces, all of whom were too distracted by him to notice Rogers was escaping.

Giant-Man rips apart an entire airplane
Wreaking havoc across the airport to keep the enemies distracted, Giant-Man threw War Machine across the airport before he ripped the wing of a nearby airplane. He then attempted to attack Black Panther; however, he was knocked back by War Machine firing explosives near his face. Meanwhile, Vision reappeared on the battlefield and knocked Giant-Man back before flying through him to try and stop Captain America's escape by blocking his path.

Giant-Man tries to fight against Spider-Man
While Wanda Maximoff helped Captain America get past the Vision, Giant-Man found himself surrounded by Iron Man, War Machine and Spider-Man, all of whom worked together to try and defeat Giant-Man however they could. Taking inspiration from The Empire Strikes Back, Spider-Man used his own Web-Shooters to tie up Giant-Man's legs and force him to become unbalanced before Iron Man and War Machine both flew upwards and knocked him to the ground.

Ant-Man is defeated in the battlefield
Although Giant-Man was taken out of the fight, this stunt provided exactly the distraction Captain America and Bucky Barnes needed to escape, taking control of the Quinjet and using it to get away from the battlefield. With his weight having been used against him, Giant-Man accepted his defeat. Exhausted at this point in the battle, Giant-Man engaged the suit and returned to his regular size, requested orange slices to help him recover from the painful experience.

Prisoner of the Raft
Lang tries and fails to insult Tony Stark
After the Clash of the Avengers, Lang, Clint Barton, Wanda Maximoff, and Sam Wilson were all captured, along with the Ant-Man Suit, and taken to the Raft where they were imprisoned under the orders of Thaddeus Ross for destroying the airport and aiding Captain America, the Winter Soldier and Falcon. When Tony Stark visited, Lang said Hank Pym was right not to trust the Starks. Much to Lang's frustration, the Avenger leader asked him who he is sparing only a confused and dismissive glance at Lang before he moved on to speak with Wilson.

Escape from the Raft
Lang remains a prisoner within the Raft
Lang was then forced to continue his sentence within the Raft, playing a beat by tapping his hands on a chair; however, Rogers infiltrated the Raft and freed him, Clint Barton, Sam Wilson and Wanda Maximoff from their imprisonment, with Lang recovering the suit. Despite being on the run as wanted fugitives, Rogers told Stark that should he ever need their help, all he would have to do is ask.

Lang soon returned to his daughter in San Francisco, knowing he was still a wanted man for allying himself with Steve Rogers, and alongside Barton ended up making a deal with the government to be placed under two years of house arrest instead of being returned to the Raft. In order to prevent the suit from being taken, Lang informed the authorities, and later, Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne, that he had destroyed the suit, although in reality he had shrunk the suit down and mailed it to Luis for safekeeping.

Under House Arrest
Spending Time with Cassie
Lang playing a treasure game with Cassie
As per his deal, Lang was sentenced to two years of house arrest, followed by three years of probation, along with no contact with Hank Pym or Hope van Dyne. Should he disobey any of these conditions, he would face twenty years in federal prison. After nearly finishing his two years under house arrest, Lang became much closer with his family again, especially Cassie and also co-founded the security consultation business X-Con Security Consultants with Luis, Kurt Goreshter, and Dave.

Lang talks to Luis about the house pitch
Inside his home, Lang played with Cassie on a treasure game, trying to find a micro treasure. Using a pretend map, Lang went through trials to find it such as Ant-on for directions using Luis' help and going through fake lasers. Once they reached their destination, Lang was surprised to see his "Greatest Grandma" trophy, questioning why it was picked as the treasure. Cassie responded that it was a treasure to her and wanted to take to show-and-tell, but Lang rejected that idea.

Lang talks to Cassie about shrinking down
Stating that the trophy was very important, Lang made the decision to keep it, leading Cassie to agree. Interrupted, Luis told Lang about the abundance of security cameras inside a house they are selling but told Lang told him not to worry about the amount as long as they are approved. Once they were done talking, Lang and Cassie went on over to the stairs filled with cardboard and slide onto Ant-oinette across the room and outside of the backyard, crash landing a fence.

Lang talks to Luis about not worrying too much
Once they crash-landed, Lang was told by Cassie that she wish she shrink down to small size to which Lang agreed that it was cool to become minuscule. Luis came back to check up on Lang and told that he'll leave for work despite his nerves being unadjusted. Telling Luis to not worry, Lang discovered his leg with an Ankle Monitor was away from his house and broke the fence, resulting in the FBI coming to check on him.

Lang is confronted by Jimmy Woo and the FBI
Once the FBI noticed the signal, Lang's home was checked upon his accident. Lang told Jimmy Woo not to worry about the incident as he didn't mean to trigger the signal. Once Cassie questioned Woo of his actions, Lang noticed his explanation of the Sokovia Accords and that he was in trouble for his visit with Captain America. Lang sarcastically insulted Woo's explanation, but took it as a compliment. Woo then questioned Lang about any contact with Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne, but Lang told him that never tried to contact them.

Lang waving farewell to Cassie as she leaves
After suffering another checkup with the FBI, Lang witnessed Maggie Lang and Jim Paxton picking up Cassie and promised her that once his three-day arrest is over, he will spend time with her by eating ice cream, simulating another card trick before her farewell. As he had the home all to himself, Lang spent the day on playing the drums, bowling, learning more Close-up magic, doing karaoke, reading The Fault in Our Stars, and making paper birds in his room.

Lang calls Hank Pym about his weird dream
During his regular bath routine, Lang had a dream where he saw himself in the Quantum Realm once again before taking on the body of Janet van Dyne in memory of hers in which he found a little girl hiding in a red dresser. Startled by the vision, Lang woke from his sleep and went to the room and inexplicably called Pym about it, using a secret phone to contact him, but no one answered and instead left a message.

Kidnapped by Hope
Lang is stung by an artificial insect
On the night after his rest, Lang was watching Animal House on the TV while eating cereal only for a bug to sting him on the neck. Not thinking anything of it, he continued eating cereal until he suddenly fell unconscious. After a brief sleep, Lang woke up in the passenger seat of a van and saw van Dyne sitting beside him, driving ahead. Lang then told van Dyne if being with her was a dream to which she retorted with asking if her mother was seen in his dream.

Lang reunites with Hope van Dyne in her van
Taking a moment to realize his location, Lang freaked out as he knew the FBI would be on the chase for him. Van Dyne showed him that the Ankle Monitor was off and that he was safe, but both she and Pym were very mad at him for participating in the Clash of the Avengers in Germany, as it caused her and Pym to be fugitives due to the fact that the Ant-Man Suit, which was a violation of the Sokovia Accords, was built by and belonged to them, and had to cease communicating with Lang.

Lang tells Hank Pym about destroying the suit
When they arrive at the Mobile Laboratory, Lang noticed a big structure being built by ants, which Pym and van Dyne mention is a portal to the Quantum Realm, whose concepts came from one Pym made when he worked at S.H.I.E.L.D.. As they continued to talk, Lang was told that he destroyed the Ant-Man Suit in case of any suspicion but lied to Pym about destroying it, leaving Pym in such dismay. As he kept on apologizing, Lang mentioned his dream while calling him.

Lang dismisses his involvement with the tunnel
As Pym and van Dyne noticed his mention of the dream, Lang told them about him being Janet van Dyne playing hide-and-seek with joy as a young little girl hides away from a dresser. After telling about his dream, Pym and van Dyne had finally gathered a connection that Janet may be alive in the Quantum Realm. To finish their portal, they still needed a component to keep the tunnel from powering up. As Pym and van Dyne are leaving the lab, Lang told them not to involve him with the plan or else he'll end up in prison.

Lang sees Hank Pym's lab shrunken down
Once Hope van Dyne explained she'll bring him back to his home, Lang listened to Pym about the entanglement won't last him long enough and needed to move quickly. Lang then asked Pym and van Dyne that he needed to hide inside only for the lab being shrunken down and was told to put on his clothes that van Dyne brought along. To get the component, they drove on a new van from Pym's car collection to close a deal with Sonny Burch.

Ant-Man and the Wasp
First Encounter with Ghost
Lang watches Wasp fight Sonny Burch's men
When they arrived at the Oui, van Dyne revealed she had purchased from Burch, a black market dealer, the parts she and Pym needed for their Quantum Realm portal. However, van Dyne had been going by a different name, Susan, and Burch mentioned he had learned her real name and relation to Hank Pym, and then he forced her to give him the money. Van Dyne ended up leaving the money without the part, but she quickly fought them off afterward in her Wasp Suit to successfully gain the portal part.

Ant-Man and the Wasp trying to find Ghost
Just after van Dyne succeeded, a figure known as Ghost appeared and challenged van Dyne for the portal part. Van Dyne was losing, but Lang had no suit with him until Pym offered a prototype suit. Ant-Man showed up and aided Wasp into taking down Ghost. She, however, knocked them out and then stole Pym's Mobile Laboratory, which had their lab in it.

Lang at Luis’ X-Con office
To find a place to figure out what happened, Lang suggested going to X-Con Security Consultants Office. Luis said that there were rumors about someone who could phase through walls, which they saw at the restaurant. They needed help, and although he didn't like it, Pym had a former colleague from S.H.I.E.L.D. who could help.

Meeting Bill Foster
Lang, van Dyne and Pym visit Bill Foster
Lang realized that he would soon have to return home so that the FBI could not find out that he had been breaking house arrest. Pym and van Dyne insisted that they must get the lab back, as it was their only way of finding Janet and rescuing her from the Quantum Realm. The trio found that the tracker on Pym's lab had been disabled, leaving them with only one option for tracking it. Reluctantly and begrudgingly, they visited Pym's estranged former partner, Bill Foster, at his college office. Foster told Lang that he and Pym used to work together on a project known as Project G.O.L.I.A.T.H. before Pym discredited Foster and broke off their partnership. Lang saw several FBI agents milling around the campus and suspected that the three of them must have been recognized. They narrowly escaped being arrested, but not before Foster can give them advice on how to track the lab using the regulator from one of Pym's suits.

Lang taking with Hope van Dyne about the Clash of the Avengers
Pym found that the only two suits remaining without a damaged regulator were the new one Lang was using and the one Lang had used in Germany, which he had promised he had destroyed. Lang confided that he actually did not destroy the second suit, but had kept it safe in case of an emergency inside a trophy Cassie had given him. They found, however, that Cassie had taken the trophy to school for show-and-tell, forcing Lang and van Dyne to sneak into the school and steal the suit out of the trophy. While inside the school, Lang's regulator malfunctioned, causing him to grow and shrink to random sizes, before getting stuck at the height of an elementary schooler. They escaped the school and used the regulator to track down Pym's Mobile Laboratory in the Ghost's lair, where she knocked them out.

Lang, van Dyne and Pym captured by Ghost
When the three came to, the Ghost revealed herself to be Ava Starr, daughter of another of Pym's former partners, Elihas Starr, who died in an accident that occurred while trying to replicate Pym's Quantum Tunnel after being discredited and fired from the project. The same accident killed Starr's mother as well but rendered Starr herself quantumly unstable. This meant she was capable of passing through walls and existing in multiple realities at once, though it took a toll on her: her powers were difficult to control and caused her immense pain, and would ultimately kill her if not cured soon. Foster had developed a way of using quantum energy fields to temporarily nullify her powers for periods of time, but they were not as effective anymore and Starr concluded that she would need to harvest Janet's quantum energy in order to cure herself, even if it killed Janet. Pym refused to let this happen and caused a distraction that allowed the three of them to escape with his lab once again.

Lang connected with Janet van Dyne helping Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne find her
Now in possession of the part, they were previously missing, Pym and van Dyne were able to open a stable version of the Quantum Tunnel, allowing Janet to send through a full message by temporarily possessing Lang's body. She, through Lang, helped them obtain the exact coordinates to find her in the Quantum Realm, but warned them that they had mere hours before the unstable realm separated them for centuries. Lang was then warned by Luis that Burch had tipped off contact at the FBI as to Lang's location and he was forced to flee home in order for the FBI to find him still under house arrest.

Tricking Woo
Lang finding out that Hank and Hope got captured by the FBI
Having been warned by Luis, Lang headed back home as quickly as the ant could fly, but not before getting the cold shoulder from van Dyne and Pym for getting them in trouble again. Seeing the FBI arrive, Lang headed to the bathroom, which was on the highest floor. When Cassie entered looking for him, Lang returned to normal size and asked her to buy some time by telling Jimmy Woo that he was throwing up badly. Quickly changing into his pajamas, Lang feigned vomiting as he heard Woo coming up the stairs. Woo promptly left as there was no evidence of Lang breaking house arrest.

Lang talking with Cassie
Later, Cassie told him that he needed a partner to watch his back, suggesting herself. However, Lang tells her that he doesn't want her to be part of the dangerous side of his life. He tells her that van Dyne would be a good partner for him. Cassie agreed with him, saying it's a good fit.

Chase for the Mobile Laboratory
Lang saves Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne
Meanwhile, Hope van Dyne and Hank Pym were caught by FBI agents once they shrink the Mobile Laboratory. Agent Stoltz managed to obtain it but he was suddenly attacked by Ghost, who then took the lab herself. Lang used the trained ants to help van Dyne and Pym break out of the FBI facility. The Ants guided the three to the lab's location, and Luis joined them as a backup.

Ant-Man fighting against the Ghost
Lang, van Dyne and Hank located the lab and used ants to disable the machines so Ghost and Bill Foster would not be able to access the Quantum Realm. They then draw Ghost out, allowing Hank to go inside the lab. Ant-Man, Wasp and Luis looking for Ghost. Lang suddenly got attacked by Ghost and the two began to fight. However, the Ant-Man Suit continued to malfunction, causing him not to be able to escape. This was a distraction for Pym was successful in entering the Quantum Realm, allowing them to shrink the lab and drive off with it.

Ant-Man rejoining Hope van Dyne and Luis
Lang made his escape and met up with Wasp and Luis at the rendezvous point. As they were driving, van Dyne noticed Sonny Burch approach them with his goons, causing them to chase through San Francisco. Lang then joined them in the van as more goons approached on motorbikes. Lang and van Dyne then told Lang to drive as she moved to the back to defeat the goons herself. Lang and Luis then crashed the van, causing Starr to get away from them, but Burch was still chasing after the lab. Van Dyne soon found Starr and attempted to take back the lab and fight her. Lang went to help, leaving Luis behind as he jumped on the front of the truck.

Giant-Man chasing after Sonny Burch
Lang's suit began to malfunction again causing him to grow big. He then punched Starr in the face, breaking her mask and allowing van Dyne to take back the lab. Lang attempted to stop the truck, which he was successful. He then used the truck to make his way through the streets and reach Burch. Lang and van Dyne then went to help Luis, with Wasp taking out the goons and Lang going for the lab.

Giant-Man confronting Sonny Burch
Lang who was still in giant form crashed Burch's car and then began to chase him on foot, but wasn't able to catch him due to his size. Burch then made his way onto a ferry and Lang attempted to follow him by calling in an ant, but they kept getting eaten by a seagull. He was able to get further with one ant, but it also got eaten, causing him to fall into the water. He then grew big again and swam after the ferry. He then emerged from the water and grabbed the lab from Burch.

Scott is kissed by Hope
Due to him being too big for too long, Lang started to lose consciousness as he attempted to return to the lab so they could enlarge it so Pym could get out of the Quantum Realm with Janet van Dyne. He was able to put the lab on the ground as Wasp and Luis arrived. Van Dyne realized that Lang was losing consciousness and went to save him as he fell into the water. She swam towards him and repaired the regulator, causing him to shrink, allowing her to save him. She took Lang to the surface where he grew back to normal size. He regained consciousness and the two kissed.

Ant-Man and Wasp arrive to stop the Ghost
Ant-Man and the Wasp showed up and disabled Bill Foster's machine, giving Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne enough time to come out of the Quantum Realm. Van Dyne reunites with her mother at last. Janet then sees Starr's problem, and she puts her hands on Starr to stabilize her and stop her phasing. Everyone left as they took the Mobile Laboratory.

Free Man Again
Lang is free from his home arrest
Back home, Lang played on his drum set to pass time until Jimmy Woo, again, came to see if he broke house arrest again. When Woo arrives, Lang playfully asked if he was there to tell him his three days were up. Without any evidence to prove he broke house arrest, Woo was forced to remove the Ankle Monitor. As Woo left, he threatened to see Lang again; however, Lang turned the threat into a joke by asking when.

Lang goes to see Cassie
Now free, the first thing Lang did was go see Cassie. He was warmly welcomed not only by Cassie, who was happy to see her father free but Maggie Lang and Jim Paxton as well. Meanwhile, X-Con Security Consultants obtained new clients; after Luis, Dave and Kurt took down Burch, the new clients keep their business from going under. Lang, van Dyne, and Cassie spend time together in a shrunken car, with a laptop set up akin to an old drive-in theater.

Thanos' Victory
Ant-Man about to enter the Quantum Realm
After Lang's release from house arrest and Janet van Dyne's return, he arrived at a rooftop in Luis' Van with a portable Quantum Tunnel for van Dyne and family. Their objective was to extract energy from the Quantum Realm to be able to continue curing Ava Starr's affliction. Janet warned Lang to steer clear from the carnivorous tardigrades, as well as to not get sucked by a time vortex, because it would be difficult to get him out.

Ant-Man trapped in the Quantum Realm
Lang went subatomic, harvested the needed energy, and then waited for van Dyne to finish the countdown to return him to the regular world. Suddenly, her comm went static. Unbeknownst to them, Thanos had collected the last of the six Infinity Stones during the Battle of Wakanda, and snapped his fingers to erase half of all life in the universe to achieve balance. At first, since van Dyne wasn't responding, Scott took it as a joke, but after multiple callings, he began to panic over what the big deal was. In reality, Pym, van Dyne, and Janet were all erased from existence as part of the random draw of Thanos' culling, leaving Lang stranded in the Quantum Realm.

Joining the Avengers
Escape from the Quantum Realm
Lang is finally freed from the Quantum Realm
Lang, still trapped in the Quantum Realm in 2023, was freed by a rat, who ran across the van's hood and accidentally activated its control panel. Finally out of the realm at last, Lang found himself trapped in a storage room and saw that Hope van Dyne, Hank Pym, and Janet van Dyne were nowhere to be seen.

Lang leaves the storage facility
Confused by his surroundings, Lang then asked Hope where she was. He then called for help on a security camera and fortunately, a security guard saw him and let him go with some of his belongings. Lang escaped the storage room along with some of his belongings, which he took in a wagon with him.

Lang frantically explores San Francisco
Lang then went around exploring the neighborhoods of San Francisco, seeing most of it looking post-apocalyptic. While looking around, Lang spotted a boy riding a bicycle and asked him what had happened here but the boy simply ignored him and kept on riding his bike.

Lang discovers the Wall of the Vanished
Lang soon made his way to the city's Wall of the Vanished and discovered that many people had vanished and had their names etched on the memorial. Fearing Cassie dead, he went and looked on every single one of the memorials hoping not to find her name. Much to his relief, he didn't find her name but instead his own, much to his shock and confusion.

Lang is reunited with a teenage Cassie Lang
Lang ran to Maggie Lang's House and knocked on the door and rang the doorbell repeatedly as he hoped that she was still alive. When Cassie opened the door, Lang was relieved to find that his daughter was alive but surprised that she was now a teenager. Cassie was relieved to find her father alive as she had believed he was dead. The two reunited in a tearful, joyful reunion and hug while Lang had commented on how big she had gotten.

Discussing the Quantum Realm
Lang arrives at the New Avengers Facility
After reuniting with his daughter and being made aware of Thanos and the Snap, Lang drove from San Francisco to the New Avengers Facility in New York in Luis' Van. Arriving at the compound, Lang called up at the security camera, helpfully reminding any Avenger watching that they fought back in Germany in 2016; he asked them to let him in and that he really needed to talk to them. Letting him in, Lang reunited with Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff, who wondered if he was okay.

Lang explains the Quantum Realm
As neither Banner or Stark (scientists) were around, a frazzled Lang then asked if either Rogers or Romanoff had ever studied Quantum Physics to which Romanoff said she was, only for conversation; so she had a basic grasp of the concept. He then told them about how he got trapped in the Quantum Realm five years ago due to the Snap, making them wonder how he maintained his sanity that long. However, Lang surprised them by explaining that for him, it was actually five hours in the Quantum Realm; hence why he was the same age as he was back in 2018.

Lang discusses his time travel theory
While speaking, Lang noticed some sandwiches on a table and rushed to eat some since he was hungry after being trapped in the realm for a couple hours. Rogers then tried to get Lang to clarify what he was saying, which was him saying that time works differently in the Quantum Realm, but there is no way to navigate it (especially without Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne's knowledge). Lang proposed the idea to control the Quantum Realm, entering at one point in time and then exiting at another point in time, to find a way to undo the damage Thanos caused.

Lang asks who they should ask for help
Rogers then asked Lang if he was talking about a time machine, to which Lang said he wasn't and that it was something else, but suddenly realized he was talking about a time machine. He told them that he can't stop thinking about it and that it's crazy. However, Romanoff informed him that she gets emails from a raccoon and that nothing sounds crazy anymore. Lang then asked who they should talk to about this.

Asking For Assistance
Lang arrives to meet Tony Stark at his home
Joining Rogers and Romanoff, Lang headed off to find Tony Stark, who was living a simple life with his family. Once they had arrived at his home, Lang proposed their idea of traveling back in time to collect the Infinity Stones before Thanos gets them and snap their own fingers to bring back everyone who perished in 2018.

Lang discusses Time Travel with Tony Stark
Stark disagreed with the group's decision to use Quantum energy to mess with time or else they'll never be coming back to their original timeline and it may erase his daughter and the new life he found from existence. Once Lang told Stark that he came back from the past, he told Lang that his case was a billion in one chances of a cosmic fluke thus it could not happen, being told that the group was pulling a Time Heist.

Lang urges Tony Stark to help them out
Stark continued to tell the group that it was a pipe dream. When Lang sat down with Stark by telling him that they will follow strict rules of time travel, he rejected his proposal with concern about following logic from Back to the Future. Despite Lang urging Stark by helping them to try to bring everyone back, Stark still refused, leaving Lang, Rogers, and Romanoff to find someone else with a really big brain, bigger than Stark's.

Lang meets with a transformed Bruce Banner
The three then called  Bruce Banner to meet with them at a diner. However, to Lang's astonishment and great confusion, Banner was now in complete control of his Hulk alter ego; while physically the Hulk, Banner retained control. Banner noticed the confusion and laughed off Lang's confusion with the fact he was now wearing shirts as the Hulk (plus glasses). Lang, still overwhelmed by Hulk speaking and eating like a human, required further explanation. 

Lang listens to Banner's explanation
Banner revealed his guilt about losing twice to Thanos; first as Hulk, then as Banner, and because of that, the Snap happened. He further explained to Lang that after eighteen months in a Gamma Lab, he was able to merge his mind and Hulk's body into one being. At that moment, some kids wanted to take a picture with "Mr. Hulk" so Banner asked Lang to take the picture. Lang took the photo while they said green in unison.

Lang getting turned down to be in a picture
After he took the photo, Lang asked if they wanted to take a picture with him since he was Ant-Man but quickly changed his mind as he believed they were Hulk fans. He asked Banner to take the phone and even let out a swear as the kids left. Returning to the topic of time travel, Banner said that time travel was out of his expertise but agreed to do a few tries.

Testing Time Travel
Lang about to test Time Travel in Luis' Van
Arriving back at the New Avengers Facility, they began working on navigating the Quantum Realm to ensure time travel. Lang put on the Quantum Realm Exploration Suit and waited to be sent through time. When Banner mentioned not wanting something to go wrong and have Lang stuck in the 1950s, Romanoff said he was kidding, but Banner was unsure of that, due to the uncertainty of the experiment. Banner then told Scott that he would send him back a week and then bring him back in ten seconds to which Lang said was perfectly not confusing.

Lang accidentally turned into a baby
Captain America then wished Lang good luck to which he responded to his idol with amazement. testing their experiments on time travel. 

Lang meets Rocket Raccoon and Nebula
Lang dove into the Quantum Realm, traveling a week back in time with Banner's assistance, but instead of Banner sending Lang through time, he ended up sending time through him as he returned as a twelve-year-old, an elderly man, a baby. Lang was brought back to his normal self when Romanoff killed the power. Returned to his normal form, Lang stated that someone had peed in his pants and he wasn't sure if it was baby him or old him, or just him.

Lang is startled by War Machine
After their failed experiment, Stark had arrived at the facility having found a way to perform time travel successfully. Lang later went outside to have some tacos for lunch. When he was about to eat his lunch, Lang's taco was destroyed when the Benatar landed at the New Avengers Facility. When Rocket Raccoon asked where Hulk was after exiting the ship, Lang responded that he was in the kitchen.

As Nebula walked past him, Lang stated that she looked awesome before she notified War Machine that Lang was in the landing zone, calling him an "idiot". Rhodes then landed very close to Lang, which startled him. He then teased Lang by calling him a regular size man before entering the facility. Seeing this, Hulk decided to give him some of his own tacos before flying to New Asgard to recruit Thor.

Testing the Advanced Tech Suit
Lang being fitted into the Advanced Tech Suit
Once all of the Avengers were assembled, including Thor and Clint Barton, they began working on the method in order to travel through the Quantum Realm. Lang was being fitted into the Advanced Tech Suit by Bruce Banner and Nebula, which he was impressed by. When Banner tried to put a Pym Particle into the suit, Lang started to get angry and unnerved and reminded him that ever since Hank Pym was snapped out of existence, this was the only Pym Particle they had left and weren't making anymore (apparently not considering the possibility of just going back in time to get more particles from Pym). Rhodes then told Lang to calm down. However, when Lang tested the suit, he shrunk and said he was not ready for it yet.

Clint Barton then volunteered to do the test run, so they then started to prepare him in the suit. As they did, Lang witnessed Rhodes suggest killing Thanos as a baby, which Banner said couldn't work. However, Lang supported Rhodes' idea by stating that they go back in time and get the stones before Thanos gets them and then Thanos doesn't have the stones which Lang said that the problem was solved, to which Rhodes and Barton agreed to. However, Nebula stated that that's not how time travel works. Lang and Rhodes then listed an array of films that featured time travel. However, Banner explained that if you travel back in time, that past becomes your future, and your former present becomes the past, which couldn't be changed by the new future. Surprised and confused, Lang stated that Back to the Future was a bunch of bullshit; because this means they can't rewrite their actual past.

Lang learns that Time Travel was a success
They all then went to the hangar to watch the test, with Barton being the first to travel through time in a controlled manner. They all stood together as Barton stood on the platform of the Quantum Tunnel while Banner prepared to send him into the past. Lang was present with Tony Stark when Barton threw him a mitt that he had acquired from the past after successfully time-traveling.

Time Heist
Locating the Infinity Stones
Lang during the planning of the Time Heist
With the means of time travel accounted for, the team brainstormed when and where they could retrieve the Infinity Stones from, addressing that they need to be specific where they travel to, as the stones have all crossed paths with most of them. They decided to brief themselves on each stone and the history of where they've been.

Lang listens to Thor talk about the Aether
Lang listened to Thor while he told them about the Aether and how his ex-girlfriend Jane Foster got it stuck inside her body and that he had to take her to Asgard, which was where he was from. However, Thor began to get off-topic due to not coming to terms with some of the trauma in his life, including his mother's death.

Lang being teased by Rocket Raccoon
That night as they all had dinner, Rocket informed the team about the Power Stone and how Peter Quill stole it from Morag, to which Lang thought it was a planet and Rocket jokingly persuaded him and patted him in the head by calling him a puppy.

Lang listens to Nebula talk about Vormir
Next, Nebula revealed the Soul Stone and how Thanos killed her sister on Vormir. By the third day, the Avengers had finished their brainstorming of the Infinity Stones and planned when and where they would travel to, to get all six stones. They then split the Avengers into small teams, each responsible for a different stone.

The Avengers complete their plan
They assigned three teams: Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner and Lang going to 2012 to get the Space, Mind, and Time Stones, Thor and Rocket going to 2013 to get the Reality Stone, and Clint Barton, Natasha Romanoff, James Rhodes, and Nebula going to 2014 to get the Soul and Power Stones. However, they only had enough Pym Particles to send them back in time and back to the present, meaning that this was their only chance.

Lang prepares to enter the Quantum Realm
The Avengers all then suited up in their Advanced Tech Suits and made their way to the platform of the Quantum Tunnel, where Captain America gave them a speech about everything that had led up to that moment and that this was their only chance to change what had happened. Lang shared with Rocket's surprise on how good Captain America was at giving them a motivational speech. Bruce Banner then activated the machine and they were all transported to the Quantum Realm, where they each traveled to their designated time.

Theft of the Space Stone
Ant-Man arrives in New York City back in 2012
Upon arriving in an alternate 2012 timeline, Steve Rogers informed them that they all knew their positions on where the Infinity Stones were. While Bruce Banner left for the Time Stone, Tony Stark, Rogers, and Lang went to Stark Tower to retrieve the Tesseract and the Scepter.

Ant-Man watches the Avengers arresting Loki
Arriving at Stark Tower, Lang rode on Stark's shoulder as they quietly infiltrated the building to obtain the Tesseract. While Stark and Lang watched the alternate versions of the Avengers arresting an alternate Loki, Stark radioed to Rogers about his alternate self's buttocks being crapped into his former uniform, to which Lang complimented that it was "America's ass."

Lang asks Tony Stark about the STRIKE team
Subsequently, STRIKE arrived to confiscate the Scepter, leaving Stark and Lang to hide out of sight. Lang asked who they were to which Stark informed him that the two lead agents, Jasper Sitwell and Brock Rumlow, were both HYDRA agents infiltrating S.H.I.E.L.D., but didn't know it at the time, much to Lang's shock as he claimed that they looked like bad guys before being quieted by Stark. Stark then flicked Lang onto his alternate self in order to get closer to the Tesseract.

Lang quietly hid onto the alternate Stark, who was transporting the Tesseract, along with STRIKE and the Avengers while Stark departed from the building in the Iron Man Armor: Mark LXXXV and stole a S.H.I.E.L.D. uniform to disguise himself.

Ant-Man smells Axe body spray under 2012 Tony Stark's shirt
Under Stark's orders, Lang went under alternate Stark's shirt, where he smelled Axe body spray, having Stark to explain he had one under a desk for emergencies. While the alternate versions of Stark and Thor argued with an alternate Alexander Pierce, Stark instructed Lang to shut off the alternate Stark's Arc Reactor to give him a cardiac arrest as a distraction.

Lang then damaged it, causing alternate Stark to suffer a heart attack. While alternate Stark had suffered pain from his heart, Lang kicked the case containing the Tesseract to Stark, his actions being noticed by alternate Loki. Unfortunately, just before Stark made it out of the Tower, he was struck by alternate Hulk, sending both Stark and the Tesseract flying.

Ant-Man disables Tony Stark's Arc Reactor
Loki used the opportunity to steal the Tesseract and escape captivity, ruining Lang and Stark's mission. Lang then jumped onto Stark and told him that that part of the plan wasn't supposed to happen, leading him to tell Lang that they messed up the plan. Lang and Stark then met back up with Rogers in the alley, who had been successful in retrieving the Scepter.

Lang upset about their mission failures
Upon meeting with Rogers, Lang complained that the Time Heist was a complete failure with their blunder of the Tesseract. Lang lectured the group that they only had enough Pym Particles for one journey home and won't be coming back. However, Stark suddenly had an idea and suggested going further back in time to a place where both the Tesseract and more Pym Particles were in the same place. Lang listened while Stark and Rogers discussed where to go to seek the Tesseract.

Lang is given the Scepter by Steve Rogers
Rogers then instructed Lang to take the Scepter back to the New Avengers Facility while he and Stark went back to 1970. Before they departed, Lang informed them that if they fail again at getting the Tesseract, they won't be coming home, to which Stark thanked him and teased him by calling him "piss ant". Lang then travelled the Quantum Realm back to the main timeline and learned that Natasha Romanoff sacrificed her life so Clint Barton could obtain the Soul Stone.

Blip
Lang and the Avengers discuss the Nano Gauntlet
After Tony Stark, Rocket Raccoon, and Bruce Banner constructed the Nano Gauntlet, Lang was present when Thor offered to use the gauntlet as he believed he was the strongest Avenger, and along with all the other Avengers, refused to let him because he was in no condition.

Ant-Man and War Machine brace themselves
However, Banner came up with the realization that he was made to do it as the radiation from the Infinity Stones was mostly Gamma, giving him the highest chance to survive the full force of the stones and warned his teammates that because of the gamma radiation, the gauntlet could kill anyone who tried to wear it. Lang made sure to lock on his mask as the rest of the Facility was locked down.

Ant-Man witnesses a flock of birds appear out of nowhere
Banner put on the gauntlet, and though he became overwhelmed by its power, he still managed to snap his fingers. As everyone checked on Banner, Lang walked out of the room and looked at the inner garden and saw a flock of birds appear out of nowhere.

Ant-Man realizes the Blip worked
Lang was amazed by the sight and told everyone that he believed the Blip had worked. His somber moment was cut short, however, as the Facility was attacked by an alternate Thanos and his warship. As the missiles obliterated the building, Lang shrunk down to survive the blast.

Attack on the New Avengers Facility
Ant-Man gets up after the destruction
After the initial attack, Ant-Man, in his shrunken size, found himself under some rubble. As he got up, he received a distress signal from War Machine saying they were drowning on the lower level. He attempted to respond to them but their connection got cut.

Ant-Man manages to escape in the rubble
As Lang moved down to the lower level, he found Rhodes, Hulk, and Rocket Raccoon all about to drown. He managed to save them by growing to his gigantic size and carrying them out of the facility, allowing War Machine to retrieve a new suit in the process and the heroes to join the Battle of Earth.

Battle of Earth
Ant-Man joins the other heroes to face Thanos
Lang then stood alongside all the assembled heroes as Steve Rogers led the charge against alternate Thanos and his alien army. In his giant size, Lang was able to punch a Leviathan out of the sky and onto the ground. He then assisted Spider-Man by crushing Cull Obsidian to death with his enlarged foot.

Giant-Man punches a Leviathan out of the sky
When Rogers realized that the Infinity Stones were in danger, he requested for Hawkeye to take the Nano Gauntlet as far away as possible. Hulk interjected, as the Stones needed to be returned to the past. However, Stark informed them that their Quantum Tunnel had been destroyed. Shrinking back to normal size, Ant-Man then informed them that they could use Luis' van, which contained a smaller Quantum Tunnel and called on the horn to the van.

Ant-Man is reunited with Wasp in battle
Ant-Man was then found by Wasp as Iron Man asked him how long he needed to get the van working, to which he said ten minutes. Rogers informed them that they would bring the Stones to them, and they then shrunk down while Wasp carried Ant-Man over to the van.

Giant-Man forcing a Leviathan through an Inter-Dimensional Portal
The two arrived at the van but found that the battery had died and that it had no power, prompting him to hotwire the van. Ant-Man then returned to the battle, becoming Giant-Man once more and forcing a Leviathan through a portal created by the Masters of the Mystic Arts as Black Panther ran with the Nano Gauntlet. Ant-Man then shrunk back to his normal size and returned to the van to activate the Quantum Tunnel.

Ant-Man repairing the Quantum Tunnel
When Captain Marvel arrived and was tasked with returning the Stones, Ant-Man turned the power on to the van so she could transport them through the Quantum Tunnel. However, alternate Thanos managed to destroy the van and Tunnel with his sword.

Ant-Man kneels before Iron Man
With no other alternatives, Iron Man took it upon himself to take the Stones and use them to wipe out alternate Thanos and his army. Though the Avengers were victorious, it came at the cost of Stark's life. Following Hawkeye, everyone, including Ant-Man, knelt before Iron Man out of respect for his sacrifice.
