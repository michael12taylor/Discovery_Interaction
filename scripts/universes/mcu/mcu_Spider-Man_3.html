<html><p>Crawling back onto the roof of the plane, Spider-Man managed to dodge out of the way of Vulture's attack, as he began furiously attempting to use his razor-sharp Vulture Wings to slash at Spider-Man and either kill him or knock him overboard or into the engine. Spider-Man managed to keep avoiding the attacks, webbing himself onto the plane to stay onboard, as Vulture was then informed by the Tinkerer that his attacks had caused some major damage.

Spider-Man desperately tries to turn the plane
Seeing the plane was going down, Spider-Man realized to his horror that the plane was about to crash into New York City as thousands of people would be in serious danger if they crashed. While Vulture was still desperately attempting to steal the Arc Reactors and other technology from the plane to make his profit, Spider-Man then used his Web-Shooters and strength to change the course of the plane, barely managing to avoid crashing into several skyscrapers.

He succeeded in changing direction enough to save the lives of the people in New York, however, before long Spider-Man's webbing had snapped, causing him to be thrown over onto the other wing as he noticed that they were now heading directly towards Coney Island.

Duel at Coney Island
Spider-Man barely survives the plane crash
Exhausted and injured from the crash landing, Spider-Man had been forced to take off his mask in order to breath amidst the scorched air around the crash site. Without the mask on, however, all of Spider-Man's senses had then become overwhelming as he had looked across the burning Stark Cargo Plane. This momentary distraction had allowed Vulture to take him by surprise. Despite all the damage to his adversary's wings, Vulture maintained a clear advantage over Spider-Man while still being the least injured.

Vulture then engaged furiously in his attacking the injured Spider-Man, who barely managed to avoid the attacks as he struggled to shoot his Web-Shooters and get a clear shot at Vulture. Despite Spider-Man's best efforts to defend himself from Vulture's attacks, due to being already exhausted, he was unable to focus and Vulture heavily injured him by pinning Spider-Man to the ground and hitting him repeatedly before launching him high up into the air.

Spider-Man is brutally defeated by Vulture
As they flew into the air, Vulture attempted to throw Spider-Man into a steel pipe, only for Spider-Man to remain airborne due to his webs as they had a clash in mid-air. However, Vulture managed to gain the upper hand when he swiftly dropped and slammed Spider-Man into the ground multiple times, greatly injuring him against the sand banks. Being slightly conscious, Spider-Man was held up off the ground by Vulture's Wings, but as Toomes was about to kill him, he spotted a nearby crate filled with Stark Industries' Arc Reactors that he could just take.

Spider-Man attempting to save Vulture
Vulture then left the wounded Spider-Man onto the ground, continuing his mission and went to grab the Stark Industries technology instead to ensure his fortune. Upon is lift-off, Spider-Man then noticed that Vulture's wings were about to explode due to the radiation overload and desperately attempted to save him by webbing onto his wings and trying to pull him back. However, Vulture simply refused to listen to Spider-Man's warnings and instead cut the web and then attempted to fly away to his freedom.

Spider-Man pulling Vulture out of the fire
Finally, as Spider-Man had predicted, Vulture's wings did explode as he crashed back down to the ground in flames. Desperate to save the father of Liz Toomes, Spider-Man then went through the flames and managed to find Toomes lying injured, but alive. Spider-Man tried to lift the rubble only suffer a slight burn and attempted it again by letting his hands go under the sand. Spider-Man finally managed to save Toomes, as they both rested and caught their breath back.

A thankful Jones mentioned that she preferred her friends to call her "MJ".

During practice, Parker got a text from Happy Hogan to meet in the bathroom for a private conversation. Upon reading this, Parker then excused himself from their Decathlon team meeting.

Meeting Hogan in the bathroom as requested, Parker then listened as Hogan apologized for ignoring his calls and not treating him seriously.

Parker is presented a new Iron Spider Armor
Noting that there were fifty reporters who were still waiting for them, Stark then proudly displayed a new Iron Spider Armor for Parker to put on. He then told him that if Parker was ready, he would introduce all the world to the newest member of the Avengers, Spider-Man, in accordance with the Sokovia Accords. While Parker was excited at the prospect of joining the Avengers and working with his mentor, his conflict with Vulture had given him a newfound maturity.

Parker chooses to reject Tony Stark's offer
While Stark had begun explaining how Parker becoming an Avenger would work, noting he would stay next door to the Vision, Parker, however, knowing that he had more to learn before he was ready to join the Avengers, politely declined Stark's offer and simply stated that he preferred to stay on the ground for the time of being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, staying within New York City helping the people in need, much to the considerable surprise of Stark.

Parker as he leaves the New Avengers Facility
His mentor respected his decision and agreed to let Parker go back to New York, with Hogan telling him to wait in the car while he had a private word with Stark while Parker was gone. As Parker was about to leave, he turned and asked if this was simply a secret test of his character and that there was not really fifty reporters waiting for him to be announced as the latest member of the Avengers, as Stark had replied that it was and he passed, leaving Parker to walk away.

Unbeknownst to him at first, however, Aunt May saw him putting on the suit, watching in Parker's doorway as he had pulled off his mask and then loudly cursing as she questioned what was going on, much to Parker's utter shock and horror as he now had no way of explaining this. Parker would inform his aunt of his duel identity, and she came to accept it, even supporting his work as Spider-Man.

Spider-Man heading over into New York City
Looking around the bus and deciding to investigate, Parker quickly asked Ned Leeds to create a distraction for him. Leeds looked at the warship over Parker’s window and proceeded to swear and scream for his life as all the other students look over their windows to see at what was going on. While all of the students were distracted, Parker had equipped his Web-Shooters and used the ensuing commotion to open through an emergency escape hatch onto one of the windows and go onto the side of a bus. Parker proceeded to equip his Spider-Man Suit to conceal his identity and swung off the bridge to head to the conflict and figure out what was actually going on in the city.

After finishing his battle, Iron Man managed to locate the Q-Ship and fly towards the sky, contacting Spider-Man to stay put and deployed the Item 17A from the New Avengers Facility. Beginning to run out of oxygen, Spider-Man removed his mask as he was unable to breathe as much as he can. Spider-Man told Iron Man that he must save the wizard as he was told by him, but Iron Man retorted his statement that he won't be able to breathe as the ship moved upward.

As he exhaustively starts to pass out, Spider-Man was nearly suffocated as the ship left Earth's atmosphere and fell off the ship as he couldn’t breathe anymore.

As the Q-Ship made its way to the planet of Titan, Spider-Man spotted Iron Man and the Cloak of Levitation at the rendezvous point of the ship.

Stark was furious with Parker for following him through the ship, as the young hero attempted to explain himself.

Parker tries to explain his reasoning to Stark
Retracting his statement, Parker stated that it was a long way down from home and his suit was incredibly intuitive. Putting in technical terms, Parker told that it was mostly Stark’s fault for letting him on the ship. Stark angrily asked him to retract his statement which Parker took back what he said. Parker had to tell him that he should stay with him but Stark had to tell him that he needs to think his situation, to which Parker retracted, saying he did think his plan through.

Spider-Man planning to rescue Doctor Strange
Trying to be reasonable, Parker told Stark that you can’t be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.

After Stark agreed, Spider-Man walked over the edge and was asked to make himself useful and decided on how to rescue Doctor Strange below. After a moment of thinking, Parker came up with a strategy to save Strange, which was inspired by the movie Aliens.

Suddenly, Spider-Man unexpectedly activated his new suits’ spider legs and managed to hang off from the hole on the ship. Spider-Man happily saved Strange from near death. As he was hanging on, Spider-Man looked at his newfound spider legs in question. Spider-Man pulled Strange inside the ship, jumping upward with his spider legs, long enough for Iron Man to seal it. After reviving the sorcerer, Parker gave greeting to the Cloak of Levitation with a handshake to which it goes away, leaving Parker to sarcastically leave it be.

Spider-Man cordially greeting Doctor Strange
Strange argued with Stark for nearly putting his life at risk. As they argued Stark contracted that he saved him in a ship with no backup, Parker then recalled himself to be back up. Stark disagreed and told him that he was a stowaway.

Parker is declared as an Avenger
Slowly walking towards the ship and listening to the conversation, Parker watched as Stark and Strange discussed and argued about how to confront their enemy, Thanos.

Swinging onto a still pillar, Spider-Man managed to web up Mantis to safety and swiftly saved the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy members, as they were falling uncontrollably, webbing across there locality and attach them up to a cliff.

Parker listening to Ned Leeds' ideas of the trip
Unexpectedly confused, Parker asked Leeds why he shouldn't, being told that both of them will be bachelors in Europe and confidently expressed that Europeans love Americans.
