<html><p>President Matthew Ellis wanted to meet with Coulson, but Coulson was unwilling to reveal the location of the Playground, so he set the meeting at Rosalind Price's home and brought Melinda May. When Ellis arrived, the two started to talk about the Inhumans issue. Ellis thanked Coulson for his actions to solve that problem. Coulson asked if Ellis had legalized S.H.I.E.L.D., and Ellis responded that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to operate in the shadows with the Advanced Threat Containment Unit serving as their public face. Ellis promised to appoint a new head for the ATCU, who would answer to Coulson. Before Ellis left, Coulson asked him about Gideon Malick. Ellis said he could not help Coulson catch Malick, because Malick was too powerful. May said that she was sorry that Ellis hadn't given Coulson anything, but Coulson said that he might have. 

Coulson discuss Lincoln Campbell with Fitz
Sometime later, Coulson asked Leo Fitz his opinion on Lincoln Campbell. Fitz replied that Lincoln was helping them understand the Inhumans' biology. Coulson then ordered Fitz to turn on the Theta Brain-Wave Frequency Machine. Fitz refused, but Coulson said it was not for himself, but Werner von Strucker, who was still in a coma. Von Strucker was put in the machine and Coulson asked him about Malick. Von Strucker said, "just kill me". Coulson asked Campbell to use his powers to draw out von Strucker's memories. He did and Coulson asked again about Malick.  This time von Strucker gave him the information on how to communicate with Malick.               

Coulson speaks to Gideon Malick
Coulson went to a remote location and called Malick. He had May trace Malick's location. Malick answered and Coulson mocked him, noting that since the Attack on the HYDRA Castle, Malick had lost his Inhumans and had been forced into hiding. Malick assured him that his influence was stronger than Coulson understood. Afterward, Coulson tried on the new robotic hand that Fitz had built. It looked human. May comforted Coulson about what had happened in Maveth. Coulson then said that Malick was still collecting Inhumans for an unknown purpose. Later, Ellis called and told Coulson that he had appointed Glenn Talbot as the new head of the ATCU. Coulson was not thrilled with that choice.

Working With Glenn Talbot
Glenn Talbot would not return Colson's calls, so Coulson met Talbot in the airport after his wife had left. Coulson said that he preferred they would work as partners, but Talbot rejected the idea. Coulson said they should prepare for the Symposium on Alien Contagion about the Inhumans. On their way to Talbot's car, Coulson said he would try to find out which country possessed Inhumans during the symposium. He also wanted to know which one of the delegates was working for Gideon Malick. In the parking garage, Melinda May and Lincoln Campbell warned Coulons that someone was approaching. Coulson saw that it was Carl Creel. May and Campbell fought Creel and Lincoln came close to killing him. Coulson ordered Lincoln to stop using his powers. Talbot then got out of his car and said that Creel was his bodyguard.

Coulson briefs his agents on the mission
In Coulson's office, Talbot demanded Creel join the mission. Coulson's agents refused, claiming he couldn't be trusted. Coulson knew the head of the ATCU must be present at the symposium, so he agreed to Talbot's demand. He then explained that Inhumans weren't welcome at the symposium, and they couldn't bring weapons. On Zephyr One, Coulson told May, Lance Hunter and Bobbi Morse that their mission was to enter the delegates' rooms, find clues of foreign Inhumans and uncover Malick's inside man. 

Coulson and Glenn Talbot arrive in Taiwan
During the symposium reception, Coulson introduced himself as Sean Lundwall, an expert on Inhumans. Using his prosthetic hand, he shook each delegate's hands to copy their fingerprints for May, Hunter and Morse to use to gain entry to the delegates' rooms. Talbot suspected everyone of working with Malick. Coulson, Talbot and the delegates gathered in the meeting room and Talbot gave a brief opening statement. The conversation quickly turned to Inhumans, with Coulson attempting to convince the group that they were only seeking peace. While Haruto Yakimura remained skeptical, Anton Petrov suggested that Russia was willing to become a sanctuary state for the Inhumans. Nathi Zuma agreed with Petrov and called for a vote. Talbot and Coulson briefly discussed what their options were.  

Coulson is betrayed by Glenn Talbot
Moments before Chen called for the vote, Talbot interrupted and called in the guards. He accused Coulson of being a traitor and showed how Coulson had been spying on them all and was not Sean Lundwall as he had claimed. Malick then entered and accused Coulson of being the Director of HYDRA. Coulson realized that Talbot was the traitor. Malick used images of Lash's victims as proof of Coulson wanting to exterminate Inhumans. The guards took Coulson while he asked Talbot what Malick had done to him.

Coulson was brought to the basement and the guards removed his robotic hand. Malick and Talbot entered with Talbot begging that his son be returned to him. Coulson cursed Malick for extorting Talbot and the guards punched him in the stomach. Malick refused to honor his deal with Talbot and locked him in a cell with Coulson, handcuffing them together. When Coulson questioned Malick's motives, Malick explained that he was building an army. Coulson said that Malick would soon be facing a different army, and Malick left the room, ordering his men to execute the pair. 

Coulson enters the truck
While waiting for their deaths, Talbot joked that he preferred Coulson die first so he could be left in peace at last. When Coulson questioned why he remained confident, Talbot explained that he had a man on the inside. At that moment Creel burst into the room and defeated the guards, saying that he and Hunter had found Talbot's son. When another guard burst in, Talbot and Coulson were forced to run while still handcuffed, with Talbot grabbing Coulson's prosthetic hand on the way. Creel then uncuffed them and Coulson ordered Morse and Hunter to get on Malick's plane to track his location. May told them that Talbot's son was on a truck and Coulson, Talbot and Creel ran to the truck to retrieve him.

Back on Zephyr One, Talbot sat beside his sleeping son as he slowly recovered from his ordeal. Coulson stood by and commented on how happy his wife would be now that he had gotten his son back. They briefly discussed their partnership and when Coulson casually called him General, Talbot told him to call him Glenn, but noted this would only be occasionally. Coulson expressed his concerns to May, that perhaps Malick was reporting to someone or something else.

Mission in Russia
Coulson oversees the mission in Russia
Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter were hidden inside Gideon Malick's plane. Coulson followed them to Russia, observing their actions from Zephyr One. Coulson listened in as Malick held a meeting with Russian leaders, discussing the Inhumans and the proposed sanctuary. Coulson and the team learned that the Russian minister of defense, General Androvich, was an Inhuman, and Coulson realized that Malick planned to use the minister to stage a coup and kill the prime minister of Russia, who did not support the sanctuary.

Coulson ordered his team on the ground to rescue the prime minister before he was killed. In doing so, Morse killed Androvich and was captured along with Hunter. Coulson had to try to rescue them from prison, knowing that if Russia knew S.H.I.E.L.D. still existed and was working with the United States of America, it could be viewed as an act of war. Coulson, along with President Matthew Ellis, visited the prison where Morse and Hunter were being held.

Posing as an advisor to the Advanced Threat Containment Unit, Coulson was granted permission to speak with Morse and Hunter. Shorting out the prison's video system, Coulson told the two that he would set off an EMP allowing the pair to escape. However, Morse and Hunter refused to run, stating that to protect S.H.I.E.L.D. and the United States, they would allow themselves to be disowned. Though deeply saddened, Coulson allowed Morse and Hunter to make the choice and he eft the room, negotiating their release in return for them never being agents again.

Coulson says goodbye to Lance Hunter and Bobbi Morse
Later, Coulson, along with Daisy Johnson, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons, Melinda May, and Alphonso Mackenzie all visited a bar where Morse and Hunter were. Without directly contacting them, Coulson and the others all ordered shots for the two, saying goodbye in the only way they could. Coulson was the last to leave, and took one last look at the pair before departing.

Testing Lincoln Campbell
Following the Attack on the ATCU Storage Facility by the Watchdogs, Coulson called Alphonso Mackenzie and ordered him to inspect the site. Mack left with Daisy Johnson and Leo Fitz for Zephyr One, as Lincoln Campbell returned from his evaluation at the Cocoon. Coulson told them that he had received Campbell's evaluation and had decided not to assign him to Johnson's mission without explaining why, despite Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter having left S.H.I.E.L.D. Later, Johnson called Coulson and informed him that the Watchdogs used Nitramene to implode the building. Coulson remembered that former agent, Felix Blake, had always wanted to improve its formula.

Campbell later found Coulson walking around the Playground looking for him. Coulson told Campbell he wanted to bring him on a mission. He needed to locate Blake and he knew where Blake's safe-houses were. At first Campbell was pleased that Coulson was inviting him on missions but Coulson explained that he was not happy with Campbell's evaluation and wanted to watch him first hand.

Campbell asked Coulson about his evaluation as they rode in the Quinjet to Blake's possible location. Coulson said the evaluation suggested that Campbell was only there for Johnson, not the cause. The evaluation also said Campbell had trouble controlling himself and taking orders, which had been proven in his battles with Lash and Carl Creel . Campbell said he felt as though he were constantly being tested. Coulson insisted that was being tested because he still needed to be vetted.

They arrived at Blake's safe-house and found it to be in total darkness, so they began exploring with their weapons drawn ready for a fight. Johnson told Coulson she had found Blake's location and he ordered her not to attack. Coulson was surprised when they found Blake in the basement, since Johnson had said he was somewhere else. Blake drew a gun on the pair and Coulson noted how well he had recovered since his encounter with Deathlok. Coulson told Blake he was working for the ATCU now. Blake began ranting about how there had never been a S.H.I.E.L.D., just HYDRA and how S.H.I.E.L.D. was now working with Inhumans, whom he called freaks.

Coulson orders Lincoln Campbell to kill Felix Blake
Coulson suspected that Blake was not actually there. Blake commented on how S.H.I.E.L.D. had caused the Battle of New York while the Avengers created Ultron. Coulson ordered Campbell to kill Blake, and Campbell argued against the idea, but Coulson insisted it was an order. Campbell fired a blast of electricity at Blake and discovered it was merely a hologram, just as Coulson suspected. Coulson said he was impressed by how Campbell had handled the situation so effectively. 

Later, they learned that the Watchdogs were coming after Johnson and Mackenzie. Johnson informed Coulson that Gideon Malick supported the Watchdogs with weaponry.

Preparing for the Future
Coulson goes to check on Charles Hinton
On Zephyr One, Daisy Johnson received a call from Edwin Abbott, who desperately wanted her help. Coulson and his team went to investigate. A shaken Abbott tried to explain that he had already seen these events happen in a vision of his own death given to him by Charles Hinton. Suddenly, the team was attacked by HYDRA, who killed Abbott and used the Extraction Claw to kidnap Hinton, just as he touched Johnson, giving her a vision of her own.

The team returned to the Playground where Johnson explained her vision, saying she had seen Coulson shooting her. They began discussing how they could try and get ahead of the vision and change the future, but Leo Fitz insisted that it was a fixed point in time which could not be altered no matter what they did. Coulson suggested that they keep Johnson from leaving the Playground in hopes of changing the course of the future. Coulson suggested Melinda May should go to save Hinton instead of Daisy.

Coulson speaks with Lincoln Campbell
Coulson discussed the matter with Lincoln Campbell inside his office, where Coulson used the example of The Terminator as a confusing depiction of time-travel. Campbell admitted he had never seen the movie and Coulson joked that he was fired. Campbell suggested that Hinton's visions were a part of a design, as all Inhumans' powers were created to fill an need, using the example of how Raina's vision allowed Johnson to stop Jiaying. They soon found Hinton's family and Campbell threatened that he would kill Coulson if he harmed Johnson.

Coulson and the team see Andrew Garner
Coulson then joined the team as they were training May to accomplish her mission as quickly as possible, based on what Johnson saw in her vision, in order to change the vision's outcome. After the first round, Coulson said he wished they could practice for every battle like that. May eventually managed to beat the time limit. Agent Anderson entered the room and told Coulson they had found the building where Hinton was being held by Hydra. Coulson said he heard of  Transia Corporation before and Fitz said he had used its technology for his prosthetic hand. Coulson gave May his orders for the mission when, suddenly, the alarms in the base went off, telling them that there was an intruder. Andrew Garner was brought into the base and explained that Lash was taking over and he wanted to say goodbye to May.

Coulson urges Daisy Johnson to be safe
Coulson urged May to stay with Garner ,since she would not see him again. May disagreed, claiming Garner was a killer, so Johnson said she would go. At first, Coulson disagreed, but Johnson explained she was their best agent who could save Hilton, and Coulson could stay in the base to change the outcome. Coulson agreed and accompanied her to a Quinjet. He urged her to be safe, accidentally calling her "Skye".

Battle at the Transia Building
Coulson learns Hive's returning
In Coulson's office, he, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons and Lincoln Campbell watched the hacked Transia Corporation's CCTV feed. As they spotted Giyera on the feed, they discussed Campbell's "higher purpose" theories of Inhumans' powers. They stopped suddenly when the video seemed to show Grant Ward in the building. Fitz theorized that it was Hive using Ward's body.

Coulson saves Johnson
They hurried to the building to help Daisy Johnson and look for Ward. Coulson saved Johnson by shooting through a two-way mirror at a HYDRA guard. He then ordered her to the roof to rescue Charles Hinton. Daisy asked Coulson what he was going to do and, to her surprise, he replied that he would find Ward. Campbell found Coulson and Coulson ordered him to locate Ward, while he went to find Gideon Malick. Coulson entered an office and Campbell said he saw Ward. In the office, Coulson discovered charred human skeletons, and he ordered Campbell not to engage with Ward.

Hive's Return
Compunction
Coulson explains the origins of Hive
Coulson was staring at a screenshot of Hive when Melinda May entered his office. She asked him what Hive was and Coulson replied that the lab was working to figure that out. He gave May his condolences in regards to Andrew Garner, but May said she did not want to talk about it. They talked about Coulson having killed Grant Ward. Coulson said he had a feeling S.H.I.E.L.D. was fixing problems they had created. The team had a meeting in Coulson's office to discuss a plan to defeat Hive. They decided to go to GT Agrochemical, a facility which had recently been raided by HYDRA.

On Zephyr One, Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz explained to Coulson that Hive had created small organisms which had consumed the victims' flesh. Simmons theorized that the organisms could also have been used to reanimate dead flesh. Simmons said she could not believe Hive was on Earth. Mackenzie approached Coulson and showed him a screenshot of Giyera in the GT facility. Coulson said that they needed to take Giyera with them, even though Giyera was dangerous even without his powers. 

Coulson investigates the scene
Coulson, May and Mackenzie entered the facility and went to the research room. They saw that the equipment had been taken and everything else had been destroyed. Coulson examined a dead bug and Mackenzie told him that all the data had been removed from the facility. An agent informed Coulson that Giyera was on the move. Coulson shot two HYDRA agents before Giyera noticed him. Coulson ran to an empty room and got out, with Giyera trapped inside it with May. May managed to knock him out and they put him in the Containment Module in Zephyr One.

Fitz told Coulson that the facility's data had been moved to an oil field in Schoonebeek. Coulson noticed that objects were flying around, so he hurried the agents out from the Module before closing it. Coulson asked Simmons why Hive would have destroyed the research from the facility. Simmons replied that Hive either wanted to use it, or he was afraid of it. Coulson asked what Hive was and Simmons said she thought Hive was just a collection of the small organisms that comprised it. Coulson realized Hive was a parasite which possessed the memories of its hosts.

Coulson was upset remembering how he had killed Ward. Fitz asked Coulson if he was OK, and Coulson realized he had unconsciously bent a pipeline with his robotic hand. Coulson said that in contrast to Fitz's justified action against Hive on Maveth, Coulson could not justify having killed Ward. Fitz tried to comfort him by saying Ward had to die, but Coulson said that Ward was now after him. Giyera then escaped the Module and Coulson tried to stop him. Giyera used his power to block Coulson's robotic hand and knocked him out. Giyera landed Zephyr One in the oil field.

Infected Teammates
Coulson managed to escape Zephyr One with Alphonso Mackenzie, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons and a wounded Melinda May. They locked themselves in a storage room at the Schoonebeek Oil Field in order to prepare a counter strike. Fitz managed to repel the HYDRA agents who were attacking the room and they were all saved by Elena Rodriguez and Daisy Johnson, who had gathered the Secret Warriors and captured Gideon Malick. The whole team then got back on Zephyr One and returned to the Playground. 

Coulson interrogates Gideon Malick
With Malick in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s custody, Coulson interrogated him, seeking answers about Hive's true nature. Malick revealed that Hive was like a god to Inhumans and that he had killed his daughter Stephanie. He also told Coulson that Hive could sway Inhumans and gain total control over them. Therefore, the Secret Warriors, who had infiltrated the HYDRA base, could have been infected. Coulson had difficulty believing Malick, but to be safe, he ordered the Playground be locked down. He then gathered Mackenzie, Fitz and Simmons to discuss their strategy and ordered the Inhumans be monitored without them noticing, while Fitz and Simmons searched for a cure. 

Coulson resumed questioning Malick, and the HYDRA leader described the assassination of his daughter. Coulson said that Malick could get revenge on Hive by telling S.H.I.E.L.D. what they needed to know. Malick reluctantly agreed and gave Coulson all the intel he had. Fitz and Simmons discovered Hive parasites in Lucio's brain, thus confirming what Malick had said. Coulson was informed but before they could plan a course of action, power was shut off to the Playground. During the blackout, Malick was killed and a grenade beside his body exploded, hurting Fitz and Simmons. Coulson found them and was told about Malick's death. He asked Fitz and Simmons to get some rest. He then ordered the Secret Warriors to gather in the common room because he suspected at least one of them could be under Hive's influence. They refused and locked themselves in a room. 

Coulson confronts Lincoln Campbell about the Kree Orb
While the Secret Warriors were arguing about who could be infected, Coulson ordered a search of their lockers. With Johnson's help, Coulson lured the other Secret Warriors into a Containment Chamber and revealed that the Kree Orb had been found in Lincoln Campbell's locker. Coulson confronted Campbell about being infected by Hive. Campbell stated he was innocent, before being knocked out by Johnson. Afterwards, the Secret Warriors were all locked in separated Containment Chambers. Coulson visited Johnson and told her that he had to disband her team to avoid further infections. He then went to the Playground's cafeteria with May. It was soon revealed that Johnson was the one infected by Hive. She escaped by causing an earthquake which damaged the Playground. Coulson was unable to stop her and she left.

Looking for Daisy Johnson
After Daisy Johnson's escape, Coulson learned from Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons about Holden Radcliffe, a scientist who could potentially help them find a cure for Hive's infection. Coulson sent the pair to Romania to find him. He also took Melinda May and Lincoln Campbell to reach Alisha Whitley, but not before ordering Campbell to wear a Nanothermite Vest in case Hive infected him. Upon arriving, May asked Coulson what would happen if Johnson or Hive showed up. The interview with Whitley went awry, because Whitley had already been infected by Hive. They managed to defeat Whitley's clones, but Coulson was upset that Campbell had crossed the line and threatened to kill one of the clones. He discussed Johnson's fate with May, saying that Johnson was like a daughter to him. Soon after, they received word of unnatural seismic activity in South Dakota and rerouted Zephyr One there. 

Coulson uses his Energy Shield against an explosion
Arriving at the site in South Dakota, Coulson discovered the remnants of JT James's Terrigenesis husk and realized that something buried near his house had been unearthed. Thanks to his newly acquired Energy Shield, Coulson and May escaped an explosion rigged by Hive and the Inhumans under his influence. Immediately after, Coulson received a phone call from General Glenn Talbot, who had used Gideon Malick's intel to arrange a broad military operation against HYDRA. Coulson green-lighted the operation and witnessed the destruction of HYDRA with May. However, Coulson had a hard time celebrating the achievement, since Johnson was still missing and Fitz's and Simmons' mission to retrieve Radcliffe had failed.

Coulson kept searching for Johnson and eventually located her in Union City, where Hive had gathered all his followers. Despite his concerns about a possible trap, Coulson sent May and Alphonso Mackenzie to rescue Johnson and kill Hive. Later, Coulson had to mediate an argument between Simmons and Campbell. Campbell wanted to test an antitoxin on himself which could destroy Hive's parasites but might prove fatal. Given the high risks, Coulson refused to sanction the experiment and ordered Simmons and Fitz to find a less lethal solution. He later returned on Zephyr One and monitored the operation against Hive. When the Kree Reapers arrived, lured by the Kree Orb's signal, Coulson ordered his agents to stand down and monitor the situation. The team managed to escape Union City, but they failed to rescue Johnson, who had injured Mackenzie, and they also failed to kill Hive.

Sokovia Accords
While watching a TV news report about the Sokovia Accords and the Avengers Civil War, Coulson had an interview with General Glenn Talbot. He agreed to take Talbot to the Playground, despite his reluctance to bring S.H.I.E.L.D. into the light, especially regarding the Inhumans, which Talbot wanted to put on a list. Coulson brought Talbot to the Containment Chamber where Lincoln Campbell was locked up. After Campbell agreed to register, Coulson revealed Lash's existence to Talbot. Talbot then said that he knew about Daisy Johnson's rebellion against S.H.I.E.L.D.

Coulson told Talbot about Hive and its plan to create an army of Inhumans. Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz informed Coulson that Hive could replicate the Kree experiment using Johnson's blood, thus creating a virus that turn all humans into Inhumans. When Talbot decided to launch a military strike against Hive, Coulson advised him against it. Their discussion was interrupted when they learned about Campbell's attempted escape. Coulson soon revealed that it was a ruse in order to send Lash to Hive so that he would help them to rescue Johnson. Though Lash was killed by Hellfire, Johnson returned to the Playground, freed from Hive's influence. Shortly after, Talbot told them that Hive had stolen a warhead from an ATCU facility, which he could use to spread the virus, turning all humans into Primitives.

Capture of Hive
In the wake of Daisy Johnson's return and the impending threat of Hive's virus, Coulson sanctioned an operation aimed at stopping the ancient Inhuman. Thanks to Leo Fitz and Glenn Talbot, Coulson got a government kill code that he managed to transmit in time and S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to prevent Hive from launching his warhead. Prior to the mission, Coulson had Fitz dismantle the Theta Brain-Wave Frequency Machine and provide the equipment to the S.H.I.E.L.D. team to be used on Hive, in the hopes that the memories of his numerous hosts would come to surface and incapacitate him. Coulson later visited Johnson in her Containment Chamber and tried to comfort her, saying that what had happened was not her fault, but Johnson rebuked him, stating she was not worthy of his trust or friendship. Facing her anger, Coulson refused to abandon her. 

The operation was successful and Hive was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. and brought to the Playground in a Gel Matrix Chamber. Although Hive was in custody, S.H.I.E.L.D. still needed to recover the warhead. Coulson ordered Holden Radcliffe to work with Fitz and Jemma Simmons in order to design a cure for Hive's infection. He also ordered the Playground to be locked down. However, it soon turned out that Hive's followers had smuggled material into the Playground in order to turn the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents into Primitives. Though several agents fell under Hive's sway, Coulson and others managed to save Fitz and another agent. Coulson then watched as the Primitives freed Hive and it boarded Zephyr One to use it to transport the warhead.

Battle of the Playground
With several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents turned into Primitives, the Playground was under siege. Coulson gave instructions to his subordinates to ensure their protection, leading Lincoln Campbell and Holden Radcliffe to the server room, but the Primitives had already taken control of it. Reuniting with Alphonso Mackenzie and a wounded Elena Rodriguez, they all locked themselves in a room. When everybody began to argue, Coulson told them to focus and help Rodriguez instead.

Coulson and the others soon figured out that Jemma Simmons had turned up the heat in order to blind the Primitives, thereby allowing them to move through the base without being seen by their enemies. The team escaped and made their way to Coulson's office, where they found Simmons.  Coulson then used his prosthetic hand to remotely call a Quinjet. He ordered the others to stay behind so he could take on Hive alone, since he felt responsible for bringing it to Earth.

Distracting Hive
Coulson confronts Hive through a hologram
The team refused to stay behind, accompanying Coulson on his mission. On Zephyr One, Coulson used a hologram to buy time, distracting Hive, while he and his team infiltrated the plane.

Coulson gathered his troops in the cargo hold and told them his plan was to send the Quinjet into outer space with the warhead containing the Absolution Virus on board. This meant that someone would have to sacrifice themself, and Johnson volunteered. Just then, Primitives arrived led by Hive, forcing Coulson and his agents to fight them. By the time they defeated the Primitives, the Quinjet had left with the warhead, Hive and Campbell, who had forced Johnson out of the Quinjet. Coulson and the others had no choice but to witness Campbell's sacrifice. Coulson told a crying Johnson that they could not bring Campbell back, that he was paying for all of their mistakes.

A New S.H.I.E.L.D.
Following Hive's death, S.H.I.E.L.D. had to change and Coulson resigned as director in order to insure that the agency could live on and that his friends could continue as agents. Jeffrey Mace became the new director and Coulson returned to being a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, teaming up with Alphonso Mackenzie for long missions on Zephyr One.

Chase of Quake
Phil Coulson and Alphonso Mackenzie on the Zephyr One
Alongside his official assignments, Coulson led endeavors to find Daisy Johnson, who had gone rogue after Lincoln Campbell's sacrifice and death. Johnson was acting as a vigilante, whom the press dubbed "Quake". After several days on a stakeout with Alphonso Mackenzie, Coulson found Johnson as she was conversing with Polly Hinton and Robin Hinton. He led in a team to catch her, but she managed to escape.

Phil Coulson is welcomed at the Playground by Melinda May
Sometime later, Coulson was returning from a six weeks mission with Mackenzie, when they were called back to the Playground without explanation. They were greeted by Melinda May, who informed them that Mace had forbidden them from searching for Johnson, as they had repeatedly failed to capture her. However, May tipped them off that Quake had been spotted in Los Angeles, giving them a head start to try to find her before S.H.I.E.L.D. went on an official mission to capture her. Before leaving, Coulson and Mackenzie went to find Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz in the lab, where Coulson was provided with a new version of his prosthetic hand.

Phil Coulson scans the truck with his prosthetic hand
Coulson and Mackenzie left the Playground looking for a missing member of the Aryan Brotherhood and a truck stolen by his organization. They found the truck and discovered several slaughtered bodies with jackets featuring the logo of the Cosmogenic company. Coulson went to investigate a Cosmogenic facility and witnessed the arrival of the Chinatown Crew, coming to pick up a weapon they had purchased from the Aryan Brotherhood. When they opened the box, a ghostly being escaped, which appeared to infect the gangsters. They began fighting and killing each other. Before Coulson and Mackenzie could intervene, May's Team appeared and subdued the gangsters. Several members of the Chinatown Crew, who turned out to be affiliated with the Watchdogs, were captured and taken aboard Zephyr One. Afterwards, Coulson returned to the Playground.

A Ghostly Disease
Phil Coulson and Jeffrey Mace discuss Quake
Following his return to the Playground, Coulson had an interview with Jeffrey Mace. Mace voiced concerns about Daisy Johnson acting as a rogue vigilante while they were on the verge of publicly revealing the existence of the agency. Mace then asked Coulson to give some United States congressmen a tour of the Playground and Coulson reluctantly agreed. During the tour, the group was joined by Jemma Simmons, who had witnessed Chen's madness due to Lucy Bauer's touch. Coulson figured out that something was wrong and took the congressmen to the Quinjet bay instead of going to the Containment Chambers. 

After he was told by Simmons to check on Melinda May, Coulson found her in the locker room, nervously emptying lockers and bags and looking for signs of infiltration. Coulson managed to temporarily calm her down, but it became evident that May was infected and she fought against Coulson and the other agents. Eventually she was stopped by Mace, who revealed his Inhuman strength by knocking May down. Afterwards, Mace informed Coulson that he would deal with May and Johnson without Coulson's help, as he could not be objective.

Miami Blackout
Coulson witness Chen's death
Coulson witnessed Chen's death as a result of his contact with Lucy Bauer and he feared the same could happen to Melinda May. Jemma Simmons went to find Holden Radcliffe to enlist his help. Meanwhile, Coulson, Alphonso Mackenzie and Leo Fitz headed to Miami to investigate an attack by the Inhuman Resistance, who had caused a series of blackouts in cities across America. On the way, they watched a TV interview of Senator Ellen Nadeer, who called for war against the Inhumans.

Coulson, Fitz and Mackenzie discover their equipment is out of service
Coulson and his colleagues arrived in Miami, where they intended to pick up Yo-Yo Rodriguez. However, their car suddenly stopped as the attackers were using a perpetual EMP device which disabled all their electronic equipment, including Coulson's prosthetic hand. They had to locate the EMP source without the aid of electronic devices. 

Coulson, Fitz, and Mackenzie arrived at the hotel which had been stormed by the Watchdogs, searching for Rodriguez. They overpowered the Watchdogs and interrogated them. Coulson learned that the Watchdogs had staged the blackouts to blame the Inhumans and hunt them down, using a mole in the Inhumans Registration Index. Meanwhile, Fitz managed to pinpoint the location of the EMP source and led Coulson, Mackenzie, and Rodriguez to it. Coulson and the others managed to turn off the EMP source and arrest the Watchdogs before reporting their success to Mace. 

Coulson later returned to the Playground and convinced Mace to publicly reveal S.H.I.E.L.D.'s existence earlier than expected. He then watched the announcement on television and received a phone call from May, indicating that she had recovered from her infection.

Capture of Ghost Rider
Coulson introduces himself to Eli Morrow
After learning that Eli Morrow was linked with Lucy Bauer and an incident at a Momentum Labs facility, Coulson went to visit him at the South Ridge Penitentiary. Coulson offered to get Morrow out of prison in exchange for help in fighting Morrow's former colleagues who were turned into ghosts. However, Morrow refused to collaborate and asked Coulson to leave. Upon leaving, Alphonso Mackenzie recognized Robbie Reyes in his Hell Charger and told Coulson that he was the Ghost Rider, so Coulson and Mackenzie chased him with Lola. After a hot pursuit, the Hell Charger violently hit a cloaked Quinjet, knocking out Ghost Rider, who was taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and locked in Zephyr One's Containment Module. 

Coulson boasts about capturing Ghost Rider
When Ghost Rider came to, Coulson questioned him. Coulson figured out that S.H.I.E.L.D. and Ghost Rider were after the same people and decided to set Reyes free in order to get his assistance. Coulson wanted Reyes to speak with Morrow, his uncle, about Bauer and her colleagues and let S.H.I.E.L.D. hear the conversation. Ghost Rider agreed and Coulson learned about the Bauers' project of building a Quantum Particle Generator using the knowledge within an ancient book. Before S.H.I.E.L.D. could investigate further, they received an alert about Hellfire, who was allegedly targeted by the Watchdogs. 

Coulson, Quake, Simmons and Mackenzie watch the explosion of Primed and Ready Fireworks
They soon discovered that Hellfire, despite being an Inhuman himself, was working with the Watchdogs to kill Inhumans. Coulson, Mackenzie, and Ghost Rider flew to Primed and Ready Fireworks and defeated the Watchdogs, capturing Hellfire and rescuing Quake and Jemma Simmons in the process. 

Later, Coulson visited Quake and Reyes and demanded their help in finding the Darkhold, saying that neither HYDRA nor Nick Fury could locate it and that Lucy Bauer was after it. Their first lead was Joseph Bauer, who had just awakened from a coma. Before that, Coulson went to the Radcliffe Residence to pick up Melinda May, who had finally recovered from the ghostly virus.

Looking for the Darkhold
Coulson and May fight the South Ridge Penitentiary's staff
Coulson and Alphonso Mackenzie visited Joseph Bauer in his hospital room, after his wife, Lucy Bauer, had awakened him from a coma. Joseph died from the ghostly infection shortly after telling Coulson and Mackenzie that his wife had probably retrieved the Darkhold. 

Coulson decided to go back to the South Ridge Penitentiary to enlist Eli Morrow's assistance. Coulson and Melinda May went to speak with the prison's director, but Bauer and her former coworkers had got there ahead of them, infecting the prison's staff and making them believe that the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were demons.

Coulson, May and Quake fight prisoners of the South Ridge Penitentiary
Coulson and May were rescued by a S.H.I.E.L.D. team led by Quake. They tried to join Mackenzie and Ghost Rider, who were seeking Morrow, but the team was slowed down by prisoners who had been released by Bauer. They managed to escape, but Quake stayed behind in order to stop the inmates. Coulson enlisted Leo Fitz's help in rescuing Quake. Coulson and the others managed to get out of the penitentiary, only to discover that Bauer had kidnapped Morrow.

Search for Eli Morrow
On Zephyr One, Coulson monitored a S.H.I.E.L.D. intervention at Momentum Labs, where they learned that Lucy Bauer had reclaimed some pieces of equipment in order to replicate the experiment that had turned her into a ghost so that she could reverse the process. They later had to deal with Jeffrey Mace, who had come to arrest Quake and Ghost Rider after the mayhem at the South Ridge Penitentiary. Coulson ordered Quake, Ghost Rider and Gabe Reyes to hide in the plane's Containment Module. Mace told Coulson that Ghost Rider had murdered Santino Noguera and demanded he be delivered to S.H.I.E.L.D.

Coulson and Mace watch Ghost Rider forcing his way out of the Containment Module
Mace figured out where Quake and Ghost Rider were hiding. Coulson was ordered back to the Playground, but he tried to advise Mace against it. He then watched as Ghost Rider forced his way out of the Containment Module and fought Mace. Coulson tried to stop Ghost Rider but it was his brother Gabe who managed to calm him down. After a discussion with Mace, Coulson, Ghost Rider and May headed to an old Roxxon Corporation facility where Bauer and Eli Morrow were supposed to be. When they encountered Bauer, Ghost Rider decided to stay behind. Coulson and May eventually found the Darkhold along with all the equipment set up to replicate the experiment. Coulson trusted May with the Book of Spells and ordered her to bring it back to Zephyr One while he remained in the facility.

Coulson learns about Eli Morrow's plans
Coulson was soon confronted by Morrow. He learned that Morrow wanted to use the Quantum Batteries to gain absolute power of matter synthesis and that he was behind the original experiment that turned Bauer and her coworkers into ghosts. Coulson was unable to stop Morrow and a violent outburst shook the entire facility, making Coulson simply vanish.

Trapped Between Dimensions
Coulson, Ghost Rider and Fitz are trapped between dimensions
Following the outburst, Coulson was trapped between the Dark Dimension and the Earthly Plane, although he was unaware of his situation at first. He was found by Leo Fitz and the two of them saw the arrival of Melinda May and Alphonso Mackenzie. Coulson and Fitz Discovered that May and Mackenzie could neither see nor hear them. Following their colleagues, Coulson and Fitz found Ghost Rider lamenting over the deaths of several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents killed by Eli Morrow. The three of them returned on Zephyr One, where they heard their colleagues' conversation about their fate. Fitz hypothesized that they were experiencing the same thing as Lucy Bauer, but to a greater extent.

Coulson joined May, who struggled to accept Coulson's fate. When she considered using the Darkhold to find them, Coulson tried to advise her against it, but May could not hear him. Fortunately, Mackenzie stopped May. As they were talking, Coulson heard Ghost Rider screaming as the Spirit of Vengeance forced its way out of Reyes' body in an attempt to escape from Hell. The demonic entity took possession of Mackenzie's body and left the plane, chased by Quake and Robbie Reyes, while Coulson looked on.

Coulson and Fitz returned to the Playground, where Holden Radcliffe had been summoned by Jeffrey Mace to help them bring back their missing coworkers. May told Radcliffe and his assistant Aida that Coulson's disappearance was linked to the Darkhold and gave him the book. However, Radcliffe refused to read the book after having glimpsed its contents. Coulson thought that was a smart move, given the dangers of the Darkhold. Fitz disagreed and told Aida to read the Darkhold, revealing to Coulson that Aida was an android. While Aida read the book, Fitz and Coulson argued about Aida's creation and about Coulson resigning  as S.H.I.E.L.D. director, which Fitz saw as a failure that endangered the life of Jemma Simmons.

Coulson is nearly aspired into the Dark Dimension
Using the knowledge of the Darkhold, Aida designed Laser-Coupling Gloves and used them to build an Inter-Dimensional Gate. They were running out of time, as Coulson and Fitz were dragged deeper into Hell, with Coulson nearly completely sucked into the dark dimension. The Gate finally  opened and Fitz struggled to pull Coulson out of Hell's grip. The two eventually escaped to safety. Later, Coulson and May discussed what had been done to bring Coulson back and they decided to open Nick Fury's bottle of Haig. They were later informed by Quake that the Spirit of Vengeance had left Mackenzie's body and returned to Reyes.

Defeating Eli Morrow
While Eli Morrow and the Chinatown Crew were causing mayhem in Los Angeles, Coulson convinced Director Jeffrey Mace to deploy a S.H.I.E.L.D. team made up of Quake, Ghost Rider, and Aida, although Coulson had to admit to Mace that Holden Radcliffe's assistant was an android. Later, Coulson voiced his concerns about Mace to Melinda May and boarded Zephyr One to Los Angeles. On site, Coulson gave a body camera to Ghost Rider and had him enter the Chinatown Crew Headquarters. He then discovered the giant Quantum Battery built by Morrow, containing a Demon Core.

Morrow trapped Ghost Rider inside the Battery and Quake tried to go and help him, but Coulson ordered her not to. Coulson and Quake returned to Zephyr One, where Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz explained that Morrow could trigger a nuclear explosion if anyone tried to interfere with his plans. They were joined by Mace, Radcliffe, and Aida. Coulson and Mace debated what to do. They then argued about Coulson's actions and secrets, as well as Mace's secret collaboration with Ellen Nadeer. Mace told them that he had been blackmailed by the Senator and that he had to protect S.H.I.E.L.D. They decided to put aside their disagreements and work together to stop Morrow, following Fitz's plan.

Coulson confronts Eli Morrow
Coulson went unarmed to the Chinatown Crew Headquarters and confronted Morrow while his colleagues were getting ready for battle. Coulson explained to Morrow that he was not creating matter out of nothing but was harvesting it from another dimension, causing earthquakes around Los Angeles. Morrow dismissed Coulson's theory and threatened to trigger the bomb. S.H.I.E.L.D. had to intervene. With the assistance of Elena Rodriguez, Alphonso Mackenzie, May and Mace, Coulson defeated the Chinatown Crew. Finally, Ghost Rider used his powers to prevent Morrow from escaping, sacrificing himself so that the Quantum Battery would be transferred through an Inter-Dimensional Gate, saving Los Angeles.

Everyone returned to the Playground, where Coulson and Quake discussed the fate of Ghost Rider and Quake's personal crusade. Coulson admitted that he had considered trusting Daisy Johnson with the directorship of S.H.I.E.L.D. Then they joined their friends and watched the T.V. news about the S.H.I.E.L.D. victory in Los Angeles. Later, Coulson finally opened Nick Fury's bottle of Haig with May, unaware that his friend had been replaced by a Life-Model Decoy.

Aida's Betrayal
Coulson attended a meeting in Jeffrey Mace's office and discussed how to dispose of the Darkhold. Coulson told the others that the book would be trusted to another agent and that Aida's memory would be erased. Coulson soon learned of Aida's rebellion at the Radcliffe Residence and that she had killed Nathan B. Nathanson. Coulson tried to locate Aida, to no avail. When Holden Radcliffe and Leo Fitz returned to the Playground, they hypothesized that reading the Darkhold could have altered Aida's programming. Radcliffe told Coulson that he thought Aida's objective was to become sentient.

Coulson attempting to fight against Aida
While Coulson and the others were trying to locate Aida, the android made contact with S.H.I.E.L.D. and demanded the Darkhold. When Coulson refused, Aida shut down the Playground's systems. Coulson gave orders to his team and went with Melinda May to try to stop Aida. They were soon confronted by the android, who quickly overpowered them and locked them in a storage room. Coulson disabled the camera and waited for Fitz and Radcliffe to power the base again. While waiting, he and May discussed what to do and Coulson revealed that he had hidden the Darkhold inside Mace's office, unaware that Aida was monitoring their conversation using May's LMD's eye camera.

Coulson eventually escaped the room and found Aida, who had seized the Darkhold and tried to escape the Playground before being destroyed by Alphonso Mackenzie. Coulson reclaimed the Darkhold with the intent of quickly disposing of it. After a conversation with Mace, he also learned that Senator Ellen Nadeer was the one behind the dangerous Watchdogs.

Jeffrey Mace's Lie
Coulson provides security for Jeffrey Mace
Jeffrey Mace gave a public press conference, stating that Quake had been working undercover with S.H.I.E.L.D. all along. Coulson and Alphonso Mackenzie were in the crowd managing security. Coulson noticed that one S.H.I.E.L.D. agent was missing from from his post on a rooftop. Immediately after, the Watchdogs attacked in an attempt to assassinate Mace. Coulson and Mackenzie took Mace and Burrows to a nearby Quinjet in order to evacuate the Director. While discussing the assault, the Quinjet was also attacked and crashed in Freyer National Park, killing Burrows and McCafferty and leaving Coulson, Mace and Mackenzie with no opportunity to call for backup. Coulson suggested they try to get a signal, but Mace insisted on finding Burrows' body first.

While searching for Burrows, Coulson and the others heard the sound of an engine and saw a radio truck jamming their communications. Coulson and Mackenzie wanted to stop and destroy the truck, but Mace was keen on finding Burrows and especially the briefcase he was carrying. They stumbled on a Watchdogs squad who had seized Burrows and the briefcase. Coulson and Mackenzie assaulted the Watchdogs, but Mace ignored the fight, reclaiming the briefcase and running away, before being shot and nearly killed by a Watchdog. They soon learned that Mace was not an Inhuman after all. The briefcase contained a super-serum he had been using to gain his super strength, all according to General Glenn Talbot's plan.

Phil Coulson fight the Watchdogs with his Energy Shield
Mace's lie drastically changed their situation as there were more Watchdogs to fight. The three S.H.I.E.L.D. agents took refuge in a cabin. Coulson ordered Mace to put on his suit and continue acting like the Patriot, since the Watchdogs didn't know that Mace was not an Inhuman. When gunshots erupted, Coulson protected Mace with his Energy Shield and he and Mackenzie took down the radio truck and more Watchdogs. Quake and Melinda May arrived as reinforcements and helped them defeat the last soldiers.

Coulson confronts Glenn Talbot
Coulson returned to the Playground and confronted Talbot about Mace. Talbot showed no remorse and angrily left the room, leaving Coulson alone with Mace. Mace told Coulson the truth about what happened to him in Vienna. He also offered to resign and to officially make Coulson Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. again. Coulson refused. He preferred to have Mace remain as the face of S.H.I.E.L.D., while Coulson would be in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. operations.
