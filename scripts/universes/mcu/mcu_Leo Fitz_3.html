<html><p>Fitz confronts Elliot Randolph
Returning to the Playground, Randolph looked at the Monolith and was fascinated, having never seen such an artifact before. As they discussed its powers, Randolph made it clear that they should destroy it; Fitz assured him that he would have to go through him first. Not wishing to kill Fitz, Randolph relented and asked for more information. The team told him about the scroll which Fitz had recently recovered and Randolph recognized the writing from a castle he had visited hundreds of years ago. Confirming his thoughts, Randolph told everyone to join him in the plane to investigate.

Further Experiments
Fitz explores a castle in England
The team traveled to England to the castle which Elliot Randolph had visited all those years earlier. Randolph confirmed that it was the same castle and described the party he had attended there where he had seen the writing on the walls of the castle. The group found the writing and before long, Phil Coulson found a secret passage leading to another room which Randolph had never seen before. The room was filled with ancient machinery and a trap door which seemed like the perfect size to hold the Monolith. Once they confirmed the room was designed to test the Monolith's power, Coulson called Alphonso Mackenzie and ordered him to bring it to them.

Fitz conducts a test with the Monolith
Although reluctant, Mackenzie brought the Monolith to them in Zephyr One and they set it up for their experiment. Fitz led the team in setting up their equipment as they worked out how to work the machinery. They turned on the machine which triggered a vibration that caused the Monolith to transform into liquid; Fitz looked down at it and called out to Jemma Simmons. Demanding more light to see, Phil Coulson threw Fitz a flare gun which he fired into the liquid, making it instantly vanish. Before they could get their answers however, the machine broke and the Monolith returned to stone. The vibrations also caused Daisy Johnson to collapse as she complained of a terrible noise which nearly killed her.

Rescue of Jemma Simmons
Fitz searches for Jemma Simmons
Despite the machinery being broken, Fitz worked out that Daisy Johnson could use her powers to trigger the same effect. Johnson agreed despite the terrible effect it would have on her and the experiment was set up for a second attempt. Johnson used her powers to create a small earthquake which caused the Monolith to turn to liquid; while Coulson and Bobbi Morse set up a video feed to drop inside, Fitz attached a rope to himself and jumped inside. Fitz fell onto a desert planet in the middle of a sandstorm. Without hesitation, he began to desperately call out for Jemma Simmons.

Fitz successfully rescues Jemma Simmons
To his shock, Simmons answered him and he saw her appear from behind a rock. The two friends called out to one another and desperately fought against the powerful winds to reach one another. However, back on Earth, Johnson struggled to control her powers and to keep the Monolith liquid, forcing Phil Coulson to order that Fitz be pulled back. Fitz was just able to grab Simmons' hand as he was pulled back into the portal. The moment the pair were sucked back to Earth, Johnson collapsed and the Monolith exploded. Fitz hugged his friend and smiled to the team as they celebrated their victory. 

Fitz sleeps beside Jemma Simmons
Once she had gone through medical tests and deemed to be safe from infection and physically well, Simmons was allowed to go to sleep aboard Zephyr One. Fitz stayed by her bedside while she slept. Once he had fallen asleep, Simmons awoke from a nightmare and attempted to defend herself with a blade. However, once she remembered where she was, she turned to see the sleeping Fitz sitting beside her. Simmons found comfort resting on Fitz's lap and fell into a more peaceful sleep.

Helping a Friend
Dinner Date
Fitz caring for Jemma Simmons
Fitz would talk to the team, about Jemma Simmons physical had changed due to her experience on the Monolith. He would help her adjust, to Earth's gravity and accompanied her to the lab, where Bobbi Morse welcomed her. Fitz theorized that if she saw the lab again, she would feel better. Fitz noticed that small noises diverted her, as like when Morse's phone when off. Fitz is told by Simmons, that she wanted to go to her room to relax. He then start speaking with Morse, about how distanced Simmons is. Fitz is told by Morse, that Simmons needed a fresh start to learn how to live again on Earth.

Fitz comforting Jemma Simmons
Fitz then left the room, and made a reservation a restaurant just for him and Simmons, just like he promised to do months ago. He brought Simmons to the restaurant and told her that the reservation had been waiting for months and he planned it so that they would eat alone. Simmons said she did not know what to say for what he had done for her, so Fitz said that she did not have to say anything. But as she started to cry, Fitz sat next to her and comforted her.

Learning About Will Daniels
Fitz asking Bobbi Morse about Jemma Simmons
Fitz would join Phil Coulson and Bobbi Morse to Hollywood, California, to gather evidence from the apartment of Shane and Lori Henson, two Inhumans killed by Lash. Fitz would become annoyed with Morse, due to her because to difficulty adhering to the system that he and Jemma Simmons had developed. When Morse asked about Fitz and Simmons dinner, Fitz responded with it went find. But when He asked Morse if Simmons revealed anything to her about her experiences on the other planet, which Morse would lie, saying that she knew nothing.

Fitz is confronted by Jemma Simmons
Fitz and the team would return to the Playground to analyze the samples, Fitz is alerted by Morse that they have a hair sample of Lash began to dissolve. While discussing the strange occurrence, and if Morse had somehow contaminated the sample, Fitz found a notebook filled with research on the Monolith. Simmons ran into the lab and abruptly grabbed the notebook from Fitz, causing the paper to fall to the floor. Collecting her research, Fitz is told by Simmons to leave her things alone as she left.

Fitz declaring that they will find Will Daniels
Later, Fitz went to Simmons' room and asked her why she was researching the Monolith; Simmons decided to give him full disclosure about her experience on the other world. After telling him about her ordeal and her relationship with Will Daniels when she gave up hope of being rescued, Fitz left the room without speaking to Simmons. She, teary-eyed, begged him to understand her feelings. Fitz told her that he did understand her feelings and showed her his computer screen; it revealed the research that he had done over the past six months that she had been absent to locate her. Fitz declared to Simmons, that they would save Daniels and return him to Earth.

Researching Will Daniels
Fitz annoyed by Lance Hunter
Fitz was assigned to act as technical support for Melinda May and Bobbi Morse, as they went to the Cayman Islands in search of Werner von Strucker. He allowed his computers to run simulations pertaining to the Monolith, as he made cover aliases and backgrounds. Fitz was met with Lance Hunter, who was reassigned for his actions with Grant Ward and putting Andrew Garner's life at risk. Fitz was asked by Hunter, why he was helping Jemma Simmons to rescue Will Daniels, a man about whom he knew nothing, when Fitz had feelings for Simmons. Fitz didn't answer, asking Hunter why he was there. Hunter wanted to help him, but Fitz quickly asked him to leave when he began touching the computers.

Fitz researching Werner von Strucker's lock box
During May and Morse's undercover mission, Fitz would do research on von Strucker to find Ward, using the Backscatter Glasses which Morse wore. They would find Strucker's fake IDs and passports in his lock box, when an alarm went out. When Morse asked how much time they had, Fitz responded with zero. Fitz would determine that von Strucker, was in Lisbon, Portugal and which he informed Morse and May.

Fitz reading a newspaper articles on Will Daniels
Fitz is asked by Simmons how his research into the Monolith was progressing. He could only tell her that the computer simulations had not yet found a way to open a viable portal. Fitz is told by Simmons, if he know Daniels, then he would understand why she wanted to rescue him. Fitz assured Simmons, that he will get to know Daniels. When Simmons left, Fitz, unknowing to Simmons, returned to reading background information and newspaper articles on Daniels.

Accessing Simmons' Phone
Fitz watches Jemma Simmons' logs
Fitz is asked by Jemma Simmons, to fix her phone when she had used during her survival on Maveth. Fitz would go uncover though Simmons' files and would watch her logs, when he would find his video on Simmons' birthday party. Fitz watched in shock, as he witnessed what Simmons' submitted logs and images about the groundbreaking realities of the planet and that of Will Daniels.

Fitz talking with Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter about Will Daniels
Fitz continue researching, as he noticed that Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter, that Daniels had a symbol on his uniform similar to one he had seen in the English castle, weeks ago. Morse thought that NASA had sent Daniels through the Monolith, but Fitz gave a theory believing that an ancient order truly sent Daniels. Hunter dismissed Fitz's conspiracy theory as lunacy, but Morse would tell to him check it out.

Fitz watches the sunrise with Jemma Simmons
Fitz had given the fixed phone to Simmons, he would start to question Simmons about her entries. Fitz now wondering, about her state of mind as she placed them. Simmons, knowing that Fitz was referring to her affirmations of love to him and her said desire to start a family with him, told Fitz that she had perfect clarity when she made her logs. The two then watched as the morning began.

Discovering an Unlikely Connection
Fitz is briefed on Operation Spotlight
Fitz would continue this research on his theory, he scrolls and books brought to the lab. The agent moving the books dropped them, and Fitz angrily confronted him over his carelessness. Jemma Simmons calmed him down, before becoming angry with him when he mentioned bringing back Will Daniels. Fitz would follow her to the lab, bringing him into her search along with being angry with him for being so willing to bring back Daniels. Fitz retaliated, saying he was incredibly angry and sick, not at Simmons but at the cosmos for keeping them apart. Fitz was present at a debrief from Coulson on initiating Operation Spotlight, an infiltration of the Advanced Threat Containment Unit.

Fitz shares a kiss with Jemma Simmons
As Fitz continued to work on a way to bring back Daniels, Simmons would start to get angry with him. Fitz would try to calm her down, but she would end up leaving. Fitz would go and confront Simmons in the lab, asking her do she want him to help or not. Fitz is told by Simmons, that she expected him to get angry with her, and he had not. Fitz would tell that he is sick, that they are cursed and the universe want them apart. Fitz listed all the obstacles to their relationship, culminating with Daniels. Fitz asked Simmons if she loved Daniels, to which Simmons hesitatingly answered yes. Fitz agreed and began listing all of Daniels' character traits, saying that he had done everything for Simmons. However, Simmons cut him off and reminded Fitz that he had jumped through a portal to rescue her. Fitz stared at Simmons for a second, then kissed her. Simmons kissed him back, but Fitz broke away and mouthed "I love you" too Simmons before whispering that they were cursed and walked away.

Fitz shows the team his discoveries
Fitz was called back by Simmons when she noticed that a book that had fallen off the desk had opened to a page with a symbol similar to the modern HYDRA insignia. The two realized that HYDRA was behind Distant Star Pathfinder and had been sending people through the portal for centuries. Fitz and Simmons revealed their research to the other agents, laying out paper with each insignia, beginning with the Distant Star Pathfinder logo and continuing to the HYDRA symbol. Their research showed that HYDRA was inside NASA and the Advanced Threat Containment Unit.

Kidnapped
Fitz is interrogated by Phil Coulson
When Rosalind Price was killed by Grant Ward, Phil Coulson summoned all the original members of his team to interrogate them about Ward to try and uncover anything to help understand him. Fitz was brought in, Fitz would tell Coulson that he saw Ward in his bunk. Coulson asked him, did he steal anything, which Fitz say no, but he was just sitting there staring at a picture of Fitz and his mom.

Fitz learns of Project Distant Star Return
When Fitz was done with the interrogation, he returned to the lab where Alphonso Mackenzie brought in Luther Banks to see if he knew of the symbol that they recently discovered, which revealed to be associated with HYDRA. Banks explained that the symbols was from a project called Project Distant Star Pathfinder, a NASA program Banks was apart of. He revealed Gideon Malick funded the project, Coulson sent Fitz, Jemma Simmons and Banks to an abandoned Project Distant Star Pathfinder facility in search of clues to the Monolith.

Fitz in the Distant Star Facility
While there, Simmons expressed her belief that it was unlikely they would find anything, but Fitz replied that they still could find something to help them bring back Will Daniels. Simmons told him that they could not bring him back, but Fitz said that they now knew exactly where the portal would open on Maveth, so they had to go there. Simmons told him that it would be selfish to potentially allow HYDRA to achieve their goal, but Fitz said that the HYDRA leader was only a legend. Fitz would protest, staying that it was important to get Daniels back, which he is told that she wanted to bring the man that saved her, but told him that it would be selfish to allow HYDRA to achieve their goal.

Fitz and Jemma Simmons are taken captive
Before Fitz could respond, the two heard shots. Quickly turning, Fitz saw Banks shoot the other agents, then turn the gun on the two. Fitz asked Banks not to shoot them; however, Banks managed to say it was not him before the gun floated out of his hand, turned, and shot Banks in the head. Shocked at the sudden mysterious attack, Fitz and Simmons watched as Giyera entered the room and ordered them to follow him.

Fitz listening to Grant Ward torture Jemma Simmons
In the HYDRA Castle, Fitz and Simmons were brought to Ward and Gideon Malick. Fitz refused to help them open the portal, but Malick claimed that they did not need their help, so Simmons understood that they did not know how to bring someone back from there. Fitz and Simmons refused to cooperate with them, so Ward ordered to separate between the two. Fitz was tied up to a chair and heard Simmons' cries from the other room, and Ward told him that he could end this by telling them what they need.

Battle of Maveth
Fitz about to enter Maveth
Unable to stand hearing Jemma Simmons being tortured, Fitz agreed to enter the portal and guide HYDRA's team. Entering the portal chamber, Fitz saw Simmons restrained by Giyera. She broke free from his hold and ran to Fitz; when Giyera started after her, Fitz told him that the deal was off if he touched her. Simmons begged him not to go, but Fitz assured her that the only thing he would bring back would be Will Daniels. Hugging Simmons, Fitz saw Grant Ward enter the chamber in full combat gear. Asking him what he was doing, Fitz learned that Ward was leading the HYDRA team. The portal opened and Fitz, Ward, and the other agents jumped through.

Fitz and Grant Ward see a HYDRA statue
Once through the portal, the team began searching for It. Hiking up a rise, Fitz tried to distract Ward by showing him the program he was using to find the exit portal, before going for Ward's gun. However, Ward realized his intent and kicked Fitz down a ridge before following him down and threatening that Simmons would die if he did not return, and it would be Fitz's fault. One of Ward's soldiers called out for him to come and he walked away. Fitz followed him to the soldier, where he saw an old structure in the shape of HYDRA's symbol. Fitz continued on with the team.

Fitz meets "Will Daniels"
Fitz realized that the area that they were walking through was familiar; looking around, he noticed a metal hatch in the ground. Knowing he had found the home of Will Daniels, Fitz entered the hatch, with a furious Ward following him. Once in the cave, Fitz found what he believed to be Daniels with an injured leg on his bed. "Daniels" sat up and questioningly recognized him; Fitz confirmed that it was him as Ward stormed in, angry that Fitz had entered the cave without permission. Fitz panicked as Ward threatened to shoot "Daniels", hastily explaining that "Daniels" was to be their guide and he was the only way to find It. Ward noticed the insignia on "Daniels"' suit and agreed to take him, first offering Fitz the chance to shoot him. Fitz told Ward to grow up and once he had confirmed that "Daniels" could walk, the group left the cave.

Fitz takes cover in the No-Fly-Zone
Walking with "Daniels", Fitz explained that Ward was part of an organization dedicated to bringing back their leader, It. Fitz listened as "Daniels" informed him that they were in the 'no fly zone'. Fitz listened as Ward asked "Daniels" what the structure they had seen was; "Daniels" told him that it was a shrine to It, and that It had lived there. "Daniels" formed a plan to escape from Ward and ordered Fitz to follow his lead. As they continued, a sandstorm began to form, and the team eventually had to shelter behind some rocks. Fitz watched as "Daniels" killed the two HYDRA agents sheltering with them, and he and "Daniels" crept away before Ward realized their escape.

Fitz shoots Hive with a flare
Fitz and "Daniels" continued on towards the exit point. As they walked, Fitz saw an ancient city, and asked "Daniels" about it, asking why Simmons had not told him about it. "Daniels" replied that she had never seen it, and explained that there were nine such cities, and the inhabitants had torn each other apart. Suddenly, "Daniels"' leg gave out and he fell. Fitz ran to him and pulled the bandage away to try to assess the damage; he saw only bone and rotting flesh, and realized that what he had believed was Will Daniels was in reality It, inhabiting Daniels' corpse. It began attacking Fitz, who held It off for a time, but was beaten back. Just as It was about to crush Fitz with a rock, It was shot by Phil Coulson.

Fitz witnesses Phil Coulson killing Grant Ward
Fitz got up and watched Coulson fight Ward, before realizing that It had also regained its feet and had begun walking towards the now-opened portal. Fitz found a gun and shot It again, but It continued on. Finally, Fitz discovered his flare gun and engulfed It in flames, finally stopping the dark Inhuman. Realizing that the portal was about to close, Fitz screamed for Coulson. Fitz watched Coulson kill Ward, before both entered the portal and were rescued by Alphonso Mackenzie, back on Earth as they made their hurried escape.

Fitz is reunited with Jemma Simmons
Getting onboard the Containment Module, Fitz, Coulson, Mackenzie and Daisy Johnson managed to escape the HYDRA Castle just as it was destroyed by missiles. Reaching Zephyr One the group reunited with their friends and teammates while Fitz watched as Simmons searched for Daniels inside the empty Containment Module, before realizing he was not there and turning back to Fitz as she began to cry. Fitz hugged Simmons to comfort her over the loss of her friend and lover, and shared a look with Coulson, knowing that Coulson had killed Ward in cold blood.

Back to Work
Missed by Jemma Simmons
Fitz talking with Phil Coulson about Will Daniels
Fitz would return to the lab assisting Jemma Simmons, where Phil Coulson ask to speak to him. Fitz is asked by Coulson his opinion on Lincoln Campbell, which replied that Campbell had been helping Simmons understand the Inhumans' biology. Fitz also told Coulson about feeling guilty for what he had done to Will Daniels. Coulson explained that he had made the hard choice, due to It using Daniels as a host. Fitz is ordered by Coulson to set up the Theta Brain-Wave Frequency Machine, which he refused at first, but Coulson said it's for Werner von Strucker, who might know where Gideon Malick was.

Fitz "meets" Jemma Simmons again
Later, Fitz finished working on Coulson's new robotic hand, as Simmons entered the lab and said that she missed him. Fitz was confused, but Simmons explained that she missed their partnership because of the recent events. Fitz told her that maybe there had been a way to save Daniels, but Simmons said that he was extraordinary, since he had been fully supportive of her since she had returned from the Maveth and killed the creature. Together they restored the moment they had met, reintroducing themselves in an attempt to start over.

Potential Cure
Fitz and Jemma Simmons asking Carl Creel about his powers
Fitz made a device for Phil Coulson that could replicate people's fingerprints, as he brought it to Zephyr One, he spoke with Lance Hunter about the Inhumans symposium. Later, Carl Creel was brought into the Playground, he was by inside a Containment Module. Fitz and Jemma Simmons would meet with his, asked him about his powers and how he could touch the Diviner without being killed, which he didn't know. They would do some of Creel's blood and test it with Terrigenesis.

Fitz examines Carl Creel's blood
The two interrupted Lincoln Campbell that Daisy Johnson's pre-Terrigenesis blood reacted to the Terrigen, but as they mixed it with Creel's blood, it broke down the Terrigenesis. They theorized that it could be a vaccine to Inhumans that were not yet transformed. Johnson entered the lab, shocked at the idea. Fitz and Simmons left the room to let her and Campbell talk.

Spy's Goodbye
Fitz oversights the mission in Russia
Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter followed Gideon Malick to Siberia, which the rest of the team would follow them on Zephyr One. They went to a compound, where Hunter and Melinda May found the body of the Prime Minister of Russia's Attaché.

Fitz farewells Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter
Morse and Hunter were caught after they entered the building. Phil Coulson asked Fitz to activate an EMP in Morse and Hunter's investigation room by his signal, but no signal was made. Coulson returned from where they had been interrogated, saying that in order to keep S.H.I.E.L.D. a secret, the two had been disavowed from the agency. Later, the team went to a bar where Morse and Hunter were. Without directly contacting them, Coulson and the others all ordered shots for the two, saying goodbye in the only way they could.

Encounter with the Watchdogs
Fitz searching the facility
Following the Watchdogs attack on the ATCU Storage Facility, Fitz is sent by Phil Coulson to go with Daisy Johnson and Alphonso Mackenzie to check out the scene. Fitz discovered that the Watchdogs had used Nitramene to collapse the facility.

Fitz discussing the Watchdogs
On Zephyr One, Fitz, Mackenzie and Johnson would discuss, the Watchdogs. Fitz brought up that if you hate something, it gives up a direction. Which Mackenzie would bring up, his brother. saying that his a good guy but he on the side of the Watchdogs. Johnson suggested to use her powers against on of them and questioning him, but Mackenzie explained that it was not about how they acted, it was about how they would respond. Mackenzie would then leave going, to return to his brother. Which Fitz would join Johnson, much to his uncertainty.

Fitz is exfoliated to a Nitramene
Fitz then helped Johnson to interrogate a Watchdog member, called Dallas Wyatt by threatening him with a gun, despite his unwillingness. After he told them the location of the Watchdogs base, they would travel there. The three arrival, and Fitz would use a D.W.A.R.F. in their barn where they saw Felix Blake. However, Fitz was shot by a member of the Watchdogs, with a Nitramene. Johnson could not defect it, which Fitz realized Blake had improved it.

Fitz learn that the Watchdogs are going after Alphonso Mackenzie's brother
In a Containment Module, Fitz and Johnson questioned a member of the Watchdogs, which they would learn from the member how to defect it. After Fitz was saved, Johnson told the Watchdogs member she would hand him over to Glenn Talbot, but he told her the Watchdogs were after Mackenzie as they mistook him for being an Inhuman.

Hive's Campaign
Daisy Johnson's Visions
Fitz discuss the timeline
Daisy Johnson saw a vision of the future from the Inhuman Charles Hinton. After she returned to the Playground, Johnson told the team she would fight HYDRA to rescue Hinton from them and Fitz and Jemma Simmons would hold hands as the snow falls. Johnson said they could change the future from happening, but Fitz explained to the team that time was an illusion of the fourth dimension, therefore the future could not be changed. Phil Coulson suggested they would send Melinda May to the mission, as well as ordering Fitz and Simmons not to go in the snow, attempting to alter the predicted future.

Fitz rehearses Daisy Johnson vision
Johnson gave details of the location of the battle to Fitz and Simmons, and they used S.H.I.E.L.D. services to find it. May entered the room and demeaned they would not use all of them. Simmons explained that she and May used some of the services to find Lash. Fitz joined Simmons, Lincoln Campbell and others as they began training to ensure Melinda May would undergo her mission as fast as possible in order to change the vision's outcome. Despite Fitz's doubts, Johnson made sure the room was laid out as accurately as possible to the vision she had had while Fitz and the other agents acted as the guards who needed to be taken out. Eventually May managed to beat the time limit.

Fitz sees Andrew Garner arrive
Eventually they were able to replicate the events perfectly, with May managing to beat the time limit. They then eventually found the location of the battle, which was owned by Transia Corporation. Coulson said he had heard of them so Fitz said he had used their technology for his prosthetic hand. Coulson gave his last orders to May when suddenly the alarms in the base went off, telling them that there was an intruder. Andrew Garner was brought into the base and explained that Lash was taking over and he wanted to say goodbye to May. Which May ordered by Coulson, to stay so she can say goodbye to her ex-husband while Johnson would go on mission.

Fitz sees the return of "Grant Ward"
May was ordered to stay behind, so she could say goodbye to her ex-husband while Johnson went into the mission and Fitz managed to hack into Transia Corporation's CCTV feed. In Coulson's office they watched as they managed to hack into the Transia Corporation's CCTV feed. As they spotted Giyera on the feed, suddenly the video seemed to show Grant Ward in the building. Fitz claimed it was likely to be the creature, that lived on Monolith.

Fitz outside Transia Corporation building
They went to the building to save Johnson and find Ward. Fitz and Simmons stayed outside. Seeing no cloud in the sky, Fitz said that maybe Johnson had not seen the future. Suddenly, Fluorescent sparkles fell from the building's rooftop, so Fitz realized Johnson had not seen snow. Simmons said they supposed to hold hands now, so the two did it.

Studying Hive
Fitz examines Hive's victims
Fitz, Jemma Simmons, Daisy Johnson and Alphonso Mackenzie examined skeletons sentenced from the skin by Hive. Fitz explained that Grant Ward's body was possessed by the Inhuman from Maveth. The team was called to Phil Coulson's office for a meeting where he explained that in order to find Hive, they would go to GT Agrochemical facility which had been raided by HYDRA. On Zephyr One, Fitz and Simmons explained to Coulson that Hive had created small organisms which had consumed the victims' flesh. As the team prepared to enter to facility and to face Giyera there, Fitz explained them his powers. Melinda May asked him about a room in the facility where she could defeat him. 

Fitz is attacked by Giyera
After they kidnapped Giyera, Fitz found that the data of the facility had been moved to an oil field in Schoonebeek. Fitz found a frustrated Coulson. He asked him if he was fine, so Coulson explained that in contrast to the justified act against Hive Fitz had done on Maveth, he should not had kill Ward. Fitz tried to conform him by saying Ward had to die, but Coulson retorted by saying that Ward got the last laugh when he killed him. Fitz then was near to the Containment Module where Giyera was inside it. Suddenly he noticed that one of the seat belt was missing a buckle. Giyera used it to escaped the module and Fitz set the alarm. He pointed a rifle at Giyera but the latter managed to take it. Fitz revealed it had no bullet so Giyera threw it towards Fitz but he missed. Mackenzie tried to beat Giyera but he failed and Giyera managed to bring the plane to the oil field.

Hive's Infection
Fitz about to spread chlorine gas
Fitz, Jemma Simmons, Phil Coulson and Alphonso Mackenzie helped a wounded Melinda May to get shelter in a storage room at Gideon Malick's Headquarters. The room was soon assaulted by HYDRA agents who began to ram the door. While Simmons took care of May's wound, Fitz and Mackenzie spread chlorine gas in the corridor, making the HYDRA agents cough and blinding them. The group was then rescued by Elena Rodriguez and Daisy Johnson before returning on the Zephyr One.

Fitz inspects Lucio's corpse
Back at the Playground, Fitz and Simmons noticed that the dead body of Lucio, killed by Joey Gutierrez during the battle at Gideon Malick's Headquarters, maintained a high body temperature, and thus placed the corpse in quarantine. Fitz later assisted Simmons during Lucio's autopsy, looking for a way to determine whether one of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Inhumans was infected by Hive. Fitz displayed some discomfort, both because of the autopsy and because of the fact that they could not trust the Inhumans present at the Playground. The two scientists then discovered the signs of Hive infection in Lucio's brain, and reported their discovery to Coulson.

Fitz discovers Gideon Malick's body
Immediately after that, the power was cut at the Playground. Fitz and Simmons made their way to the generators room and, on their way, discovered the dead body of Malick with a grenade beside it. The grenade exploded, throwing Fitz and Simmons on the ground. They were found by Coulson who ordered them to get some rest in a calm place, with Fitz abruptly rebuking Lincoln Campbell when he offered his help since they still did not know whether he was infected by Hive or not.

Fitz and Jemma Simmons kiss
Fitz and Simmons went to Fitz's bedroom where they kept searching for a test for Hive's infection. Both sitting on Fitz's couch, they contemplated one of his pictures of cosmos, discussing Hive, and Fitz jokingly noted that Hive was unable to leave Maveth without the help of humans. Fitz and Simmons then shared a tender look, holding hands before slowly kissing. Fitz apologized, remembering that Simmons had proposed to start their relationship from the beginning. However, Simmons replied that they had known each other for 10 years and that, since Fitz considered that they were "cursed", they couldn't waste any more time. They kissed again and stayed in Fitz's bedroom until Johnson, who turned out to be infected by Hive, escaped from containment by generating a earthquake which damaged the Playground.

Bucharest Mission
Fitz talks about Holden Radcliffe
Fitz ensured the rebooting of the system with the help of Lincoln Campbell. He later attended the crisis meeting held by Phil Coulson before leaving the Playground with the Zephyr One, along with the rest of his friends. He and Jemma Simmons then informed Coulson that Hive's infection on the Inhumans had the same effect than a drug addiction, making them invulnerable to I.C.E.R. shots. They suggested to make contact with Holden Radcliffe, a scientist specialized in parasitic organisms who used to work at GT Agrochemical. Radcliffe was fired from the company due to the transhumanist experiments he conducted.

Fitz and Jemma Simmons discuss their relationship
Coulson sent Fitz, Simmons and Alphonso Mackenzie to Romania in order to retrieve Radcliffe. While preparing for the mission, Fitz and Simmons, acting as they were having a professional conversation due to the presence of numerous S.H.I.E.L.D. agents around them, discussed the future of their relationship after the kiss they shared the day before, especially in the perspective of having sex. However, they were interrupted by Melinda May.

Fitz inside the Transhumanists club
In Bucharest, Fitz, Simmons and Mackenzie rented a hotel room and prepared for their mission in a private club where Radcliffe was supposed to be. Fitz and Simmons posed as two high ranking geneticists willing to sell an advanced technology to Radcliffe: a variation of the eye technology implanted in Deathlok. Mackenzie stayed in the hotel room, following the progression of his colleagues through Fitz's glasses. Fitz noticed two men staring at them and supposed that they were working for Radcliffe. Approaching them, they were greeted by Anon, Radcliffe's assistant, who asked them if they had made an appointment.

Fitz and Jemma Simmons talk privately
Upon learning that they were willing to show their technology to Radcliffe only, Anon requested that Fitz and Simmons waited at the bar until Radcliffe was ready to see them. There, they briefly cut their communications so that Mackenzie could not hear them and they resumed their interrupted conversation about moving further in their relationship. Fitz compared the fact of having sex with Simmons to a singularity, like in transhumanism or in a black hole. Simmons found the metaphor both lovely and terrifying, and the two agreed that their best option was to stop thinking about it and simply doing it.

Fitz and Jemma Simmons prepare for surgery
Anon came back to them and invited them to follow her in order to meet Radcliffe. Fitz and Simmons were brought to a small operation room where they were asked to surgically implant the cybernetic eye on a patient in order to demonstrate the efficiency of their technology. They discussed the matter with Mackenzie and resolved to follow Anon's instructions. However, before doing the surgery, Simmons noticed that the eye they were supposed to replace was not of human origin but was instead an avian prosthetic eye. The patient they were supposed to operate was actually Radcliffe himself.

Fitz argues with Holden Radcliffe
Fitz and Simmons presented their technology to Radcliffe, who recognized it as similar to the one used by Cybertek to control their soldiers through explosives implanted in the eye. Fearing that Fitz and Simmons were from HYDRA, Radcliffe ordered Anon to generate an EMP to disable their communications. Distraught, Fitz and Simmons informed Radcliffe of Hive's existence and his ability to infect Inhumans. However, before they could develop, Radcliffe's guards came across the room and tried to take them out. Fitz managed to knock one guard out and explained to Radcliffe that he was the only one who could save Daisy Johnson while Simmons was taken out.

Fitz is attacked by Daisy Johnson
Just as Fitz mentioned her, Johnson blew up the door of the operation room and proceeded to kidnap Radcliffe with the assistance of Alisha Whitley. Fitz tried to stop them, but Johnson used her powers to throw him against the wall. Johnson then smothered Fitz with her powers and demanded that S.H.I.E.L.D. stopped trying to rescue her, stating that she had finally found a family with Hive and that she was willing to hurt any S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who would come near her. Releasing a hardly breathing Fitz, Johnson finally threatened him to kill him if he came for her again before leaving the club.

Fitz and Jemma Simmons about to have sex
Mackenzie would decide to given the two agents some privacy, leaving the room, Fitz would return to the hotel room, where Simmons was awaiting him. Fitz is told by Simmons, that Mackenzie is busy at the Quinjet unloading equipment, so they were alone in the hotel room for a while. Fitz, putting in practice what he and Simmons had discussed in the club, kissed Simmons and the two finally had sex, taking a great leap forward in their relationship.

Searching for a Cure
Fitz and Jemma Simmons create a cure for Hive
Fitz and Jemma Simmons kept trying to elaborate a cure for Hive's infection. They developed an antitoxin which was shown to fight the parasites, but it was also potentially fatal to the immune system. Fitz insisted that it was worth testing. Lincoln Campbell, ready to do anything to help Daisy Johnson, offered to be their Guinea pig.

Fitz agreeing with Lincoln Campbell
They had to call for Phil Coulson in order to make a decision one way or the other. To Simmons, Campbell was only willing to try the antitoxin because he was a "lovesick fool trying to make a grand gesture". Fitz, possibly identifying with that description since he had risked his life on multiple occasions to save Simmons, thought that there was a slight chance that it could work. However, Coulson refused that Campbell received the antitoxin and ordered Fitz and Simmons to look for another solution.

Fitz asking Jemma Simmons if their fine
Fitz went to find Simmons at the Playground's cafeteria, worried that their disagreement might affect their relationship in private. Simmons reassured him, saying that she did not want a boyfriend who agreed to anything she could say, since she already had that kind of boyfriend when she dated their classmate Milton. Both agreed that they should not let their disagreements at work endanger their newfound love story. The pair jokingly talked about their time at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy on their way back to the lab, only to find Campbell who had seized a syringe and injected himself with the antitoxin. Fitz and Simmons rushed at him but Campbell, on the verge of fainting refused that Simmons gave him a drug to counter the effects of the antitoxin.

Fitz preparing Lincoln Campbell
Fitz attended to an exhausted Campbell, blaming him for disobeying Coulson and for causing malfunctions in the lab's equipment, since Campbell's electric powers burst out when he injected himself with the antitoxin. Fitz then prepared Campbell so that Simmons could perform a brain biopsy to test the effects of the antitoxin. Fitz and Simmons soon had another patient, to take care of Alphonso Mackenzie had been wounded by Johnson in an attempt to bring her back to S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson's team thus learnt of Hive's plans, turning all humans into Inhumans who would serve him while he took over the world.

Daisy Johnson's Return
Fitz and Jemma Simmons discuss Daisy Johnson
Following Daisy Johnson's infection by Hive, S.H.I.E.L.D. knew that she was able to infiltrate its systems. Fitz decided to take some countermeasures in order to keep her out of the systems, though he knew that he could not repel her attacks forever. However, Melinda May suggested another course of action, and to take the initiative instead of only defending themselves.

Fitz explains Hive's infection
Fitz attended a meeting with Phil Coulson and Jemma Simmons, during which they informed Glenn Talbot of the mechanism of Hive's infection. Fitz and Simmons also warned Coulson and Talbot that although Hive could not harvest the Kree blood he needed from the two Krees who had tried to kill him, he had another source of Kree blood: Daisy Johnson. Indeed, since the GH.325 she had been injected with when she was mortally wounded by Ian Quinn was of Kree origin, Hive could use her blood in order to successfully replicate the Kree experiment that he underwent and so transform humans into Inhumans, by creating a virus he just had to spread across the Earth.

Fitz notices Daisy Johnson's infiltration
Talbot recommended a preemptive strike by the U.S. Army, but Coulson, Simmons and Fitz disagreed. Indeed, Fitz informed Talbot that Hive had stolen something in an ATCU facility in Indiana. At the same time, Fitz received an alert indicating that Johnson was back into S.H.I.E.L.D. systems. Fitz and Simmons discovered that she had accessed Lincoln Campbell's containment chamber by fooling them with a loop on the video feeds making them think that Lincoln was asleep while he was actually talking to Johnson.

Fitz rebooting the Playground
With the help of Simmons and Alphonso Mackenzie, Fitz locked down the Playground and its systems to prevent Campbell from escaping. However, he forgot to do the same for the Quinjet systems and realized only too late that Johnson had took over on it. A Quinjet flew out of the Playground but contrary to what Fitz, Simmons and Talbot thought, Campbell was not aboard: he made Johnson believe he would join her, while actually he had no intention to do so as long as she was under Hive's influence. Campbell devised this plan with May and instead, they sent Lash to Hive. Indeed, since Lash had once spared the life of Johnson, Campbell thought that his purpose was not to kill her, but instead to kill Hive. Though they were wrong, Lash's intervention cured Johnson from her infection, allowing her to return to the Playground.

Fitz discussing Hive's plan
Fitz and Simmons asked Johnson about what she experienced beside Hive and she told them about the existence of the Primitives. They understood that if Hive had a way to generate a shock wave powerful enough, he could spread his virus and turn all humans into Primitives. Talbot revealed that he already had what he needed, since the device stolen in Indiana was a warhead.

Cure for the Primitives
Fitz tests the motion tracking sensors
In order to prevent Hive from launching a missile loaded with his virus, S.H.I.E.L.D. needed to get a missile kill code from the U.S. military. While Glenn Talbot was trying to get one from General Andaz, but the latter refused, saying that it would violate the chain of command. However, Talbot kept him long enough on the line so that Fitz could find the location of the kill codes and duplicate the voice and the image of General Andaz. Fitz then used chroma key compositing and motion tracking sensors to impersonate General Andaz during a video interview with Undersecretary Walter Thomas to obtain the kill code from him. This enabled S.H.I.E.L.D. to stop the launching.

Fitz discussing with Phil Coulson the Theta Brain-Wave Frequency Machine
Fitz dismantled the Theta Brain-Wave Frequency Machine, due to Phil Coulson's request. Fitz would help Alphonso Mackenzie and gave him instructions for the development and the deployment of the Theta Brain-Wave Frequency Machine that Mackenzie, Melinda May, Elena Rodriguez and Lincoln Campbell used against Hive in order to bring back to his mind all the memories of his previous hosts at the same time, confusing him.

Fitz and Jemma Simmons discussing taking a holiday
Following the success of the operation led by S.H.I.E.L.D, both from the Playground and on the field, Holden Radcliffe was taken into S.H.I.E.L.D's custody and ordered to work with Fitz and Jemma Simmons in order to find a cure for the Primitives that Hive and Radcliffe had created. However, Fitz doubted that they could easily find a cure. Discussing with Simmons, he soon realized that she was planning a romantic trip for both of them in the Seychelles Islands in order to get some rest far from S.H.I.E.L.D.'s agitated environment.

Fitz survives an attack from a Primitive
Fitz later approved the transfer of the Gel Matrix box in which Hive was locked in. However, he noticed that something was wrong with a shipment of mechanical pieces that were stored next to the cell. Before he could do anything, an explosion happened, spreading a pseudo-Terrigen Mist which turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agents into Primitives. Fitz escaped the mist but was almost killed by the Primitives before leaving the hangar with the assistance of Phil Coulson and Simmons. However, Hive was released by his new Primitives slaves and planned to steal the Zephyr One in order to spread his virus.

Battle of the Playground
Fitz and Melinda May discuss Daisy Johnson
While Daisy Johnson was fighting Hive after learning that he could no longer take her under his influence, Fitz went with Melinda May to check on the malfunctioning of her Containment Module. Together, they discovered that Johnson had escaped and was trying to stop Hive. At the same time, 28 Primitives had stormed the Playground and were invading it to take down S.H.I.E.L.D., quickly followed by Giyera, Hellfire and other Primitives. Hive stole the Zephyr One with Giyera and Hellfire and put it in vertical flight in order to drop his virus on Earth, but unbeknownst to them, Fitz and May had infiltrated the plane.

Fitz kills Giyera with his Cloaked Gun
Fitz and May found Johnson, imprisoned in the plane's Containment Module, but she refused to be set free, thinking she was a liability. Fitz respected her decision and wet to find some weaponry for May and him. Before they could proceed on the plane, May was knocked out by Giyera, who used his telekinetic powers to steal Fitz's gun and threaten him. However, Fitz managed to play for time by telling Giyera that he had hidden a weapon on the plane to destroy them all and seized an invisible Cloaked Gun to shoot Giyera twice, killing him. He then released Johnson and took a dizzy May with them.

Defeating Hive
Fitz tends to Lincoln Campbell's wound
They soon received reinforcements as Phil Coulson, Jemma Simmons, Alphonso Mackenzie and Lincoln Campbell used a Quinjet to get on the Zephyr One. However, Campbell was badly injured fighting Hellfire, so Simmons and Fitz had to take care of him. Fitz and Simmons then let Johnson with Campbell to give them some privacy. 

Fitz and Jemma Simmons fight the Primitives
Coulson disclosed his plan to the rest of his team: stealing the warhead containing Hive's pathogen and load it into a Quinjet to have it blown into space, where the pathogen would be harmless. However, this implied that someone had to be in the Quinjet, sacrificing himself. When they discovered that Johnson ran to the Quinjet to do it, Hive and several Primitives appeared, making Fitz and the others fight them.

Fitz reacts to Lincoln Campbell's death
To everyone's surprise, Campbell had also infiltrated the Quinjet and projected Johnson out of it, taking the Quinjet into the cosmos himself with Hive and his warhead aboard. Johnson begged her friends to bring Campbell back, but Fitz told her that it was impossible, since Campbell had suppressed the remote control and that the Quinjet could not be maneuvered in space anyway. Fitz then watched, helpless, the destruction of the Quinjet, exchanging a saddened look with Simmons at the sight of Johnson, devastated by the loss of his boyfriend.

New Director
Yo-Yo Rodriguez' Vendetta
Fitz gives Yo-Yo Rodriguez a tracking watch
When Elena Rodriguez came to the Playground in order to sign the Sokovia Accords, she went to the labs where she met with Fitz and Jemma Simmons, who were gently arguing about a television Fitz wanted to buy for their room. While Fitz was setting up her new tracking watch he had specifically designed to account for her Inhuman powers, Rodriguez asked them if they had been looking for a place to live together, much to Fitz's dismay, who told Rodriguez that from this moment Simmons would be obsessed by the matter. He then explained to Rodriguez how the watch worked. Unbeknownst to Fitz and Simmons, Rodriguez had used one of the lab's computer to perform a facial recognition on her target Victor Ramon.

Creation of Aida
Fitz and Jemma Simmons testing the Framework
Fitz would design the Framework with the help of Jemma Simmons, a virtual working environment. Fitz would discuss the new S.H.I.E.L.D. with Phil Coulson and Alphonso Mackenzie, when they brought up Simmons' promotion where she is now the Director In Science and Technology, (which Fitz jokingly called it S.A.D.I.S.T.). Fitz was told by Simmons, that she couldn't make it to Holden Radcliffe's football game.

Fitz seeing Aida for the first time
Fitz would arrive at Radcliffe's House, where he would accidentally discovered the existence of Aida, a Life-Model Decoy created by Radcliffe in order to serve as his assistant. Fitz showed great discomfort with Radcliffe's project, since he was not supposed to conduct any experimentation without oversight. Radcliffe requested Fitz's help to finish conceiving Aida but Fitz refused, thinking that the best course of actions was to report the existence of Aida to S.H.I.E.L.D authorities.
