<html><p>Maximoff being turned into dust
With Thanos finally succeeding in his plan of collecting all of the Infinity Stones, he unleashed the full extent of his new power. With a mere snap of his fingers, Thanos began to exterminate half of all lives in the universe in random succession. As a countless number of beings began to fade from existence, Maximoff knelt over Vision's lifeless body in mourning before joining the multitudes of lost souls in being disintegrated.

Battle of Earth
Maximoff joins the fight against Thanos
In 2023, as a result of the Blip, Maximoff was restored to life. She, along with the other restored Avengers and Wakandans, were then transported via portal to the ruins of the Avengers Compound to join the battle against alternate Thanos and his army.

Maximoff fights alongside the Avengers
With all heroes united, and armies rallied, Steve Rogers led the ensuing charge against Thanos' army. Maximoff used her powers to blast airborne enemies with large bolts of her psionic energy. In the thick of the battle, an enraged Maximoff, with the recollection of Vision's death still fresh in her memory, faced alternate Thanos herself and blamed him for Vision’s death.

Maximoff battles Thanos
Being an alternate version of his main counterpart, Thanos retorted that he did not know who she was. In response, she taunted him that he would as she rapidly overwhelmed him by hurling enormous piles of debris and powerful blasts of energy. After breaking his Double-Edged Sword in half, Maximoff suspended Thanos in the air, peeling off his armor and slowly tearing him apart.

Maximoff helps Captain Marvel
To save himself from her wrath, he was forced to call in an air strike from the Sanctuary II. Maximoff then tried to shield herself, only to be knocked back by the blasts, sustaining only concussive force. Relief came in the form of Carol Danvers, who destroyed the spaceship with ease. Maximoff joined Danvers as she collected the Nano Gauntlet from Spider-Man. She stood alongside other female heroes and breached through the enemy lines to reach Luis' van and the Quantum Tunnel. She cleared a path through a horde of Outriders and single-handedly held back a Leviathan.

Maximoff kneels before Iron Man
Maximoff continued to take out Thanos' army, using her powers while in flight, mainly defeating the bigger and stronger opponents. After an intense battle, Thanos and his entire army were defeated when Iron Man wielded the Stones and snapped the forces out of existence, resulting in his own life being taken. Everyone gathered around the fallen hero and knelt before him, showing their respect.

Remembering the Fallen
Maximoff attends Tony Stark's funeral
About a week later, a funeral was held for Tony Stark at the Stark Eco-Compound, which Maximoff attended along with her fellow Avengers. She stood with Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson as the funeral proceeded and watched as Pepper Potts and Morgan Stark place Stark’s Arc Reactor into the river.

Maximoff and Clint Barton comfort each other
After the funeral, Maximoff reunited with Clint Barton, who stood by her in silence, thinking of those they had lost. The two stood by the river, and Barton expressed his desire for Natasha Romanoff to know that they were successful. Maximoff assured him that Romanoff did know, as well as Vision, too. Having both recently lost people close to them, Maximoff and Barton both comforted each other. Due to her affiliation with the Avengers and her role in saving the universe, Maximoff was legally forgiven for her violation of the Sokovia Accords.

WandaVision
Wanting Vision Back
Maximoff arrives to recover Vision's body
Three weeks after being restored to life, Maximoff, wanting to have a funeral for Vision, tracked his body to S.W.O.R.D. headquarters in Florida. Maximoff pled that they return Vision to her, so they directed her to the acting director, Tyler Hayward's office.

Maximoff says her final goodbye to Vision
Hayward addressed Maximoff's intention to recover Vision's body, so he showed her to where they were dismantling him, much to Maximoff's horror. Explaining to Hayward that Vision was not a weapon, Maximoff once more asked to take his body so she could bury him, but Hayward refused, suspecting that she may want to resurrect him. Maximoff stated that she couldn't do that, nor was that her intention, but Hayward still refused. Maximoff solemnly said her goodbye to Vision, discovering that she could no longer feel him, and left the facility.

Maximoff creates a new version of Vision
Defeated, Maximoff drove out to Westview, New Jersey, where Vision had purchased a lot for them to build a house and live together. Arriving at the land, Maximoff, overcome by severe anguish, had a breakdown, causing her to unknowingly unleash her Chaos Magic for the first time, forming a new reality around her, transforming the entire town of Westview and depicting it as a 1950s sitcom. Maximoff was also able to conjure a house to live in, and finished by creating a new Vision. Upon casting her spell, she engulfed herself in her new reality, where she and Vision would go on to live happily together.

Living in Suburbia
Maximoff and Vision married in Westview
Now living in a reality of her own control, including all the inhabitants and storylines, Maximoff and the Vision she created became newlyweds who had just moved into town, attempting to blend in and live normal lives, despite Maximoff's telekinetic abilities and Vision being an android.

Maximoff is welcomed by Agnes
One day, the two noticed a heart drawn on their calendar, but neither knew what the occasion was. When Vision left to go to work, Maximoff was visited by Agnes, who welcomed her to the neighborhood. Maximoff believed that it was her and Vision's anniversary, so Agnes helped her prepare for the special night. Vision called Maximoff about the day's occasion, with the latter thinking it was their anniversary, and the former knowing it was a dinner with his boss and his wife. Maximoff, having the wrong idea, told Vision she had everything under control.

Maximoff uses her powers to make dinner
That night, when Vision came home with their dinner guests, Maximoff, wearing a night gown came down to surprise him, only to be shocked when she learned the true nature of the night. After changing her clothes, Maximoff was then forced to prepare a home cooked meal for the Harts, while also trying to hide her powers as she did. As Vision keep the Harts entertained, Maximoff struggled to cook dinner, so Vision checked in on her, and they switched roles, with Maximoff distracting the Harts. Despite the hijinks, Maximoff was able to make dinner, and the four sat down to eat.

Maximoff and Vision reaffirm their love
Ms. Hart asked Maximoff and Vision about their story, entailing where they moved from and how long they've been married, but neither of them were able to answer any of her questions. This led to Mr. Hart growing angry at the couple for not having an answer, until he begun chocking on his food. This caused the reality to break, so Maximoff told Vision to help Mr. Hart, and everything went back to normal. After the Harts left, Maximoff and Vision reflected on the dinner, and decided to make it the day of their anniversary, with Maximoff making them wedding rings.

The Magic Show
Maximoff is awoken in the night by noises
Transitioning into the 1960s, Maximoff and Vision were awoken in the night by strange noises, which turned out to just be the trees hitting the window. Because Maximoff altered their beds to now be joined together, she and Vision took the opportunity to have sex.

Maximoff discovers an in color toy helicopter
The next day, Maximoff and Vision practiced their magic act for the neighborhood talent show, in which Vision was the magician, "Illusion," and Maximoff was his assistant, "Glamour." Later, Maximoff discovered a toy helicopter in color with a sword symbol outside her house, to her confusion, but was interrupted by Agnes, and the two headed to the planning committee meeting, hosted by Dottie Jones. At the meeting, Maximoff, who was having trouble fitting in with the other women, met and befriended Geraldine, as they continue to listen to Jones.

Maximoff hears a voice speak to her
After the meeting, Jones had Maximoff clean up, while also revealing that she has heard things about Maximoff and Vision. Maximoff tried to assure Jones that she didn't intend anyone harm, but Jones didn't believe her. Suddenly, a voice came through the radio, speaking directly to Maximoff, but it was soon stopped. This added to Maximoff's worries, but she carried on as normal. At the time of the talent show, Maximoff got dressed into her costume, and nervously waited for Vision to arrive.

Maximoff and Vision doing a magic show
Eventually, a malfunctioning Vision arrived, and Maximoff attempted to tell him about the strange occurrences she experienced, but they were brought on stage to begin their act. Despite Maximoff following the routine, Vision's state caused him to use his powers in front of the audience, which Maximoff had to cover up using her own powers, including making Geraldine appear in the Cabinet of Mysteries. After the show, Maximoff fixed Vision by removing the piece of gum inside him, and they returned home, being awarded Comedy Performance of the Year.

Sudden Pregnancy
Maximoff suddenly becomes pregnant
Maximoff and Vision reflected on their day, feeling that they fitted in with the town. Then, inexplicably, Maximoff became pregnant, much to their surprise and delight. They were interrupted by a noise outside, which was a beekeeper climbing out of the sewers, causing Maximoff to rewind reality so it would not be disrupted, as well as transitioning them into a color-filled 1970s.

Maximoff being checked on by Stan Nielson
The next day, Doctor Stan Nielson was called up to check on Maximoff, who detailed that she was about four months pregnant. Maximoff was completely delighted by all this, but Vision was concerned, due to the odd nature of her pregnancy, including her going further in stages. With the pregnancy occurring at a fast rate, Maximoff used her powers to build a room for the baby, while she and Vision debated the name, with Maximoff favoring Tommy, and Vision preferring Billy. Vision calculated that the baby should be born three days from then.

Maximoff's powers act out of her control
Due to the pregnancy's acceleration, Maximoff began to get contractions, which caused her powers to go haywire. Maximoff became nervous whether this would alert the residents of their true nature, which led to Vision expanding further, noting that the recent unusual events caused him to think something was wrong in Westview. But this concerning behavior from Vision made Maximoff rewind reality so she could continue living her ideal reality. At that moment, Maximoff's water broke, causing the plumbing to flood the house.

Maximoff gives birth to her twins
Vision rushed off to get Nielsen, leaving Maximoff at home, where she was soon joined by Geraldine, who Maximoff attempted to hide her pregnancy from, which became difficult, as she got closer to going into labor. As Maximoff listened to Geraldine, she noticed a stork walk around the house, which led to Geraldine discovering the truth. At that moment, Maximoff went into labor, so Geraldine helped deliver the baby, which she did successfully. Vision then arrived, but before the they could celebrate, Maximoff went into labor again, as she was having twins, who they named Tommy and Billy.

Ejecting Geraldine
Maximoff mentions Pietro Maximoff
While Maximoff and Geraldine watched the twins, Maximoff mentioned she was a twin, bringing up Pietro Maximoff, before singing a Sokovian lullaby to her children. 

Maximoff questions Geraldine's true identity
Geraldine noted that Pietro was killed by Ultron, breaking Maximoff out of her daze, and causing her to interrogate Geraldine on how she knew about her brother. Geraldine attempted to put Maximoff at ease, but was demanded to leave, and when Maximoff noticed her necklace with a sword symbol, she grew more intent on knowing her true identity. Maximoff realized that Geraldine was not from Westview, and because she was trespassing within her reality, Maximoff used her powers to eject Geraldine out of the town.

Maximoff returns to living out her reality
Maximoff repaired the damaged walls with her powers, and then returned to her newborn twins, as Vision returned inside, asking about Geraldine. Maximoff told him that she returned home, but when she turned around, she was startled by Vision, who appeared as his corpse, causing her to look away in horror, but when she looked back, everything was normal again. Vision told Maximoff that they didn't have to stay in Westview, but she refuted it, saying it was their home, and that she had everything under control.

Raising Tommy and Billy
Maximoff and Vision are helped by Agnes
Now transitioned into the 1980s, Maximoff and Vision struggled to stop their children from crying, including Maximoff not being able to use her powers on them. Agnes arrived to help look after Tommy and Billy, but began to break character and asked Maximoff if they should redo the scene, causing Vision to be suspicious, but Maximoff tried to act like everything was normal. They then noticed that Tommy and Billy had aged-up to five years old.

Maximoff suggests no longer hiding to Vision
Maximoff later discovered that her sons had brought home a dog, asking if they could keep it. When Agnes dropped by again with a dog house, and suggested the name "Sparky," Maximoff almost revealed her powers in front of her, much to Vision's concern. Maximoff claimed that she was tired of hiding, and felt Vision should embrace the same feelings, but he did not, and grew more worried. When Tommy and Billy asked once more if they could keep the dog, they aged themselves up again to ten years old, as Maximoff and Vision felt they were too young.

Maximoff talks to her children about family
While Maximoff watched her children trained Sparky, they asked about their father's whereabouts, as she had sent him off to work to distract him. This led to Maximoff talking to the boys about how she and Vision disagree occasionally, but it would only be temporary, just like how the boys would fight with each other, but still always be brothers. Tommy then asked his mother if she had a brother, so Maximoff told him about Pietro Maximoff, telling them that he was far away, and that it made her sad sometimes.

Confronting S.W.O.R.D.
Maximoff disables a S.W.O.R.D. drone
When Sparky alerted Maximoff to a breach inside the Hex, she went outside to investigate, where she discovered that S.W.O.R.D. had sent in a drone. Monica Rambeau attempted to speak with Maximoff, but she used her powers to disable the drone, before they fire upon her.

Maximoff confronts S.W.O.R.D. out of the Hex
Maximoff picked up the drone, and wearing her Avengers uniform, she exited the Hex, where she was surrounded by S.W.O.R.D. agents who took aim at her. After throwing the destroyed drone back to S.W.O.R.D., Maximoff confronted Director Tyler Hayward, warning him to leave her alone, and that she won't bother them if they didn't bother her. Hayward refused Maximoff's request, noting that she had taken an entire town hostage, to which Maximoff retorted that they were the ones with the guns pointed at her.

Maximoff speaks with Monica Rambeau
Rambeau intervened, asserting that Maximoff was the one in control, and upon recognizing her as "Geraldine," Maximoff threateningly conjured a ball of psionic energy. Rambeau attempted to get through to Maximoff, claiming she didn't know the drone was armed, and that Maximoff, being a telepath and having all the residents in her control, knew Rambeau was a S.W.O.R.D. agent all along, and trusted her to deliver her babies. Rambeau deduced that Maximoff, knew she was an ally that wanted to help her, but Maximoff told her she had everything she wanted, and no one was going to take it from her again. Maximoff then returned back into the Hex, briefly controlling the agents to aim at Hayward.

Vision's Confrontation
Maximoff talks to her children about death
Back to her reality, Maximoff helped her children look for Sparky, who had gone missing. They were saddened to discover he had died, but Maximoff told her sons that they couldn't escape the sadness, nor could she reverse death.

Maximoff and Vision fight about her actions
After Vision finished burying Sparky, he brought up with Maximoff that he spoke with Norm, revealing that he knew she was controlling everyone in Westview. Maximoff attempted to deflect the conversation, but Vision stated that she couldn't control him. Maximoff tried one last time to end the conversation, but Vision persisted, becoming angry with her. Vision demanded to know what was outside of Westview, and exclaimed he didn't know who he was, so Maximoff reassured him of who he was.

Maximoff is reunited with "Pietro Maximoff"
Unconvinced, Vision asked why there were no children in Westview, irritating Maximoff as she continue to tell Vision she wasn't controlling everything. Maximoff revealed that she wasn't sure of how it all started, but Vision continued, telling her that what she was doing was wrong. At that moment, the doorbell rang, which Maximoff did not cause, although Vision did not believe her. Maximoff opened the door, but did not recognize the person standing before her, who revealed himself to be "Pietro Maximoff," although he looked different, to Maximoff's shock.

Halloween Celebrations
Maximoff dresses up for Halloween
Having transitioned into the 1990s on Halloween, Maximoff, wanting to spend the day with her family, dressed up as a Sokovian fortune teller, and had Vision dress up as a Mexican wrestler, having a kink for them. Maximoff and Vision discussed her "brother," who she was suspicious of, and was surprised when Vision told her that he wouldn't be joining them, as he was now going less along with Maximoff's control, but she let him leave, with "Pietro" filling in for him.

Maximoff attempts to test "Pietro Maximoff"
While walking through the streets to take Tommy and Billy Maximoff trick-or-treating, Maximoff decided to test "Pietro," asking about their childhood, but he attempted to put her suspicion at ease, acknowledging that he knew he looked different, and saw it as Maximoff not wanting to be reminded of the past. After "Pietro" took the twins to collect more candy, Maximoff encountered Herb, who revealed to her that Vision wasn't on duty for the Westview Neighborhood Watch, to her confusion. Herb asked if Maximoff wanted anything changed, but she reassured him that it was fine.

Maximoff witnesses her son gain powers
Disappointed by "Pietro's" influence on Tommy and Billy, Maximoff made them give back all the candy they stole, where she continued to question "Pietro," who outlined his role that she wanted him to play. After asking him about his missing accent, "Pietro" then explained to Maximoff how after he was killed by Ultron, he heard her calling him, so he came to Westview, knowing she needed him. Suddenly, when her sons returned, they discovered that Tommy gained super speed, like his uncle, so she told him to take his brother with him when he runs off, and not to go past Ellis Avenue.

Expanding the Hex
Maximoff and her "brother" discuss the Hex
As Maximoff and "Pietro Maximoff" admired the festivities set up in Westview, the two discussed Maximoff's current life. "Pietro" then began talking about how Maximoff was controlling all of the residents, noting that she took in some ethical considerations, and stating that he was impressed by her upgraded power set. When "Pietro" asked how Maximoff created the Hex, she wasn't sure, only remembering being filled with despair. Maximoff was interrupted by the sight of "Pietro" momentarily appearing as a bullet riddled corpse. much to her horror.

Maximoff expands the Hex to save Vision
Suddenly, Maximoff heard Billy Maximoff frantically calling out to her, telling her that Vision was in trouble, having just acquired telepathy powers. Maximoff attempted to calm her son down, asking where Vision was, but she was angered when "Pietro" said that her husband couldn't die twice, so she blasted him away. After telling him to focus, Billy then proceed to detail what he saw to his mother, resulting in her realizing he was outside the Hex. Maximoff then used her powers to freeze all the residents, and expand the Hex, saving Vision from death, and enveloping many S.W.O.R.D. agents.

True Power Revealed
Chaos Magic Falling Apart
Maximoff noticing reality go out of control
After expanding the Hex, reality was transitioned into the 2000s, taking form as a mockumentary styled sitcom, where Maximoff, in a talking head, reflected on her actions. Alone in her bed, Maximoff ignored her sons, who came to her with problems. Maximoff soon came downstairs, deciding to isolate herself, where she noticed reality uncontrollably glitch out.

Maximoff confesses about her confusion
Deciding not to worry about Vision's whereabouts, Maximoff spoke to her children about how the man claiming to be Pietro Maximoff was not actually him, and that she didn't have any answers on everything that was happening. They were then visited by Agnes, who decided to take care of Tommy and Billy for Maximoff so she could have time to herself. Maximoff continued to witness things inexplicably morph appearances, and when she talked about not knowing what was happening, her interviewer asked if it was what she deserved, to Maximoff's confusion.

Maximoff faces off with Monica Rambeau
Later, Maximoff was surprised by the arrival of Monica Rambeau, but immediately became angered when she brought up Vision and what Tyler Hayward was doing, having had enough of dealing with S.W.O.R.D.. She attacked Rambeau with her powers and brought the fight outside, which led her neighbors to witness the event. Maximoff accused Rambeau of lying and, using her powers, threw her to the ground, but to her surprise Rambeau was able to land safely with her new powers. Maximoff began to threaten Rambeau, but she withheld, which Rambeau noted was the difference between her and Hayward, and that he was making her to be the villain. Maximoff suggested that she may already be a villain, but Rambeau attempted to get through to her, only to be stopped by Agnes, who took Maximoff to her home.

Learning the Truth
Maximoff learns "Agnes" is Agatha Harkness
Upon entering Agnes' house, Maximoff asked about her sons' whereabouts, so Agnes directed her to the basement. Maximoff discovered the basement to be a dark sanctum, which she explored, until she was soon joined by Agnes, who revealed herself to be a witch named Agatha Harkness who had been secretly influencing Maximoff's reality.

Maximoff is interrogated by Agatha Harkness
Learning the truth about Harkness, Maximoff attempted to read her mind, but was unable to, so she once again asked about her children's whereabouts, but when she went to use her powers, they did not work, as Harkness had cast a protection spell. Harkness restrained Maximoff, and detailed how she waited patiently, and worked slowly, including using a fake Pietro Maximoff to manipulate her, to figure out how Maximoff created the Hex, which was a combination of many spells being cast at once. However, she was unsuccessful, and was not able to get an answer from Maximoff.

Maximoff relives moments from her past
Harkness recalled on what Maximoff said about only remembering feeling immense sadness before the Hex, and decided to enter her past to find the answer. Maximoff initially refused, but was forced when her children were threatened. Maximoff proceeded to live out the day her parents died, which were the origins of her witch abilities, then when she encountered the Mind Stone, which increased her power, then falling in love with Vision, and finally when she found Vision's body at S.W.O.R.D. Headquarters, leading to her creating the Hex in Westview, due to all the built up trauma.

Battle of Westview
Maximoff is revealed to be the Scarlet Witch
Snapping out of her past, Maximoff heard her sons calling out to her for help, so she rushed outside, where Agatha Harkness had them by the throats. Realizing the truth, Harkness explained how a being like Maximoff, which was perceived as a myth, was dangerous, having powers of spontaneous creation, which she had been using to live in a sitcom. Maximoff demanded that Harkness release her children, and she replied by telling her that her sons, Vision, and their reality were all Chaos Magic, declaring Maximoff as the Scarlet Witch.

Maximoff attacks Agatha Harkness
Being outside the runes, Scarlet Witch was able to use her powers, so she attacked Agatha Harkness, releasing Tommy and Billy Maximoff from her grip. After ordering her sons to go inside their house, Scarlet Witch continued to fight Harkness, who was actually stealing her magic, and offering to let Scarlet Witch continue living in Westview if she gave it all up to her. Scarlet Witch rejected Harkness' offer, and knocked her aside with a car, but could not find her in the wreckage.

Maximoff is attacked by White Vision
Suddenly, Scarlet Witch witnessed Vision arrive, now with a white body, so she asked if it was really him, but having been programmed by Tyler Hayward, he attempted to kill her. Before White Vision could be successful in his mission, Scarlet Witch was saved by the Vision she created, and the two reunited and amended before resuming the fight against Harkness and the White Vision.

Maximoff is confronted by her actions
Following Harkness into the middle of town, Scarlet Witch listened to her detail her true origin, stating that her power exceeds that of the Sorcerer Supreme, and her destiny was to destroy the world. Scarlet Witch refused to accept this, so Harkness freed "Dottie" from Scarlet Witch's control, along with the rest of the town's residents, who surrounded their enthraller. They all told Scarlet Witch how they hated what she was doing to them, which overwhelmed her, causing the unstable witch to accidentally hurt everyone.

Maximoff has some of her magic drained
Now seeing the truth behind her ideal reality, Scarlet Witch decided to set everyone free, and began destroying the Hex. However, when her husband and children arrived, they were being torn apart, as they were created within the Hex and therefore could not exist outside of it, so Scarlet Witch stopped destroying the Hex, keeping her family alive. Harkness attacked them, so Scarlet Witch protected her family with a force field, but it allowed Harkness to steal some of her magic, draining more of Scarlet Witch's life.

Duel Against Agatha Harkness
Maximoff fights against Agatha Harkness
The family were then surrounded by Agatha Harkness, White Vision, and now S.W.O.R.D., who breached the Hex when it opened. Scarlet Witch told her sons to deal with the soldiers as she went to continue fighting Harkness, now utilising and embracing her magic. Using her mental manipulation powers, Scarlet Witch confronted Harkness at the scene of her trial, but it soon backfired, with Harkness once again asking for her powers, promising to fix her pain, but Scarlet Witch refused and fought back.

Scarlet Witch reclaiming all of her magic
The showdown now took to the sky, where Scarlet Witch, pretending to give Harkness what she wanted, secretly began casting runes around the walls of the Hex to neutralize her enemy's magic. Having appeared to have had all her magic stolen, Scarlet Witch floated in the sky, with her entire body drained, as Harkness revealed the Hex could not be fixed, and then went to finish her off, only for nothing to happen. Wanda stopped her deception as she revealed that she casted runes around the hex so only she can use magic. As Wanda reclaimed her magic from Harkness, she transformed into the Scarlet Witch.

Scarlet Witch defeats Agatha Harkness
Returning to the ground, Harkness asked what would become of her, so Scarlet Witch revealed that she was going to trap her inside her former role as the "nosy neighbor." Harkness attempted to warn her of what she's now unleashed, stating she'll need her, but Scarlet Witch ignored her and transformed Harkness into "Agnes." Scarlet Witch told Agnes that she lived in Westview, and that she'd be seeing her in the future, before walking away and reuniting with her family, knowing it was the end for them.

Saying Goodbye
Maximoff says goodbye to her children
As the family returned to their home, Maximoff began removing the Hex, freeing everyone inside Westview. Knowing their children would be erased when the Hex was gone, Maximoff and Vision tucked them into bed, and said their goodbyes to them, not wanting to see them disappear.

Maximoff witnesses Vision being destroyed
Maximoff and Vision headed downstairs, where they understood it was time for them to say goodbye, too. Seeing the Hex closing in, Vision asked Maximoff what he was, so she explained that he was created from the piece of the Mind Stone inside of her, as well as her memories and emotions for the original Vision. In his final moment, Vision acknowledged that they've said goodbye to each other before, so it would be a matter of time before they are reunited again. At that moment, the Hex completely disappeared, along with Vision, her children, and the house around her.

Maximoff speaks with Monica Rambeau
Standing alone in the empty lot of where her house used to be, Maximoff returned to the middle of town, passing all of the people she had enthralled, feeling a lot of shame as they scowled at her. Maximoff approached Monica Rambeau, who did not share the resentment towards her, but empathized with Maximoff, knowing what she was feeling, and what she had to sacrifice. Maximoff declared that she would try to understand her power, so she said goodbye to Rambeau before flying away, just as the police arrived.

Scarlet Witch reading from the Darkhold
Maximoff decided to seclude herself, and moved into a cabin in Sokovia, where she would learn more about herself, and the power she possessed. Becoming more confident in her abilities, Maximoff was able to coexist in two forms. Her physical form performing minimal tasks like brewing a cup of tea while her astral form would read the Darkhold to learn and understand her power. One day while reading the Darkhold, Maximoff heard what seemed to be the cries of her children calling for help.

Personality
Due to childhood trauma from seeing her parents killed right in front of her, and the constant war-like state of her home, Wanda Maximoff had developed a very aggressive personality. From being involved in protests to volunteering for Wolfgang von Strucker's experiments, and joining the Avengers, Maximoff has shown that she prefers to fight directly for what she believes in. Her passionate nature and willingness to engage in violence to achieve her goals led her to mistakenly side with Ultron, which deeply influenced much of her future actions.

Her passion was partly fueled by her hatred of the United States of America and Tony Stark and was strong enough to have her side with Ultron for what she believed to be the greater good. She was unfazed when Ultron killed von Strucker and was willing to send Hulk on a rampage in Johannesburg, costing the lives of both soldiers and civilians. Fortunately, she was not blinded completely by passion and was capable of reason, clearly being appalled by the level of destruction Ultron was trying to achieve, and promptly sided with the Avengers to make amends. After getting to know the Avengers, she has since let go of any grudge or hatred she previously held against the team as well as the United States.

Due to her past affiliation with Ultron and her role in the destruction of Sokovia, Maximoff carried a deep fear of making mistakes and was frequently wracked with guilt and remorse. Her self-doubt and guilt over the mistakes she has made have at times led her to inaction, even though she is generally action-oriented. Despite this, Hawkeye was able to talk her into action, affirming her desire to fight for what she feels is right, despite what others may think of her.

In contrast with her brother, Scarlet Witch displays a more serious attitude and direct anger, not only against Tony Stark but against anyone that she perceives as her enemy, such as Klaue and Thanos. Her anger leads her to be vengeful, as demonstrated when she volunteered for experiments to become a weapon against the United States and Tony Stark, seeking out Ultron's primary body in order to destroy him after he caused the death of her brother, and angrily telling Thanos that he could not understand her pain after she was forced to kill Vision in the attempt to stop him. In the past, she had no qualms about manipulating others mentally in order to achieve what she wanted, though she later regretted doing this.

Maximoff became considerably more mellow after joining the team, as she is seen to be more compassionate, level-headed, and less inclined to use the manipulative aspects of her abilities, such as fear projection and mind control. Driven by a desire to fight in the front lines rather than as passive support, Maximoff honed her powers to become more combat-oriented, focusing on energy blasts, throws, and barrier projection, relying less on her telepathic abilities. Having become less aggressive and more reluctant to do harm, she has not been seen using her mental manipulation powers since joining the Avengers. Additionally, she rarely uses her powers to deal out lethal force unless completely necessary, using her powers more often to incapacitate her opponents. However, she also is less inclined to hold back in a fight, even against fellow Avengers, as shown when she hurled Black Widow several feet when she attempted to overpower Hawkeye. She has shown a willingness to kill her enemies in extreme circumstances, as shown when she telekinetically threw a carving knife at a perceived assailant before realizing it was Hawkeye, and when she purposefully lifted Proxima Midnight into a Thresher and shredded her to stop the latter from killing Black Widow.

Maximoff grew to care for Vision during their time together. However, she was disappointed that he was more loyal to Stark and the people of Earth than to her. However, in the aftermath of Avengers Civil War, she has put the grudge aside and developed strong romantic feelings for him to the point that, after she escaped from the Raft, she went off the grid with him to Europe and was in the beginning stages of starting a new life with him. Her feelings grew strong to the point that she tried her best to protect him from Thanos and the Black Order despite being at a great disadvantage, and refused to kill him until there was no alternative, resisting even when he himself agreed that his death was for the greater good of the universe. When forced to kill him, Maximoff openly wept as she was killing the being she loved more than anything else. Maximoff was horrified when Vision was briefly resurrected and emotionally devastated when he was killed a second time by Thanos, sitting at his side in mourning minutes before her death.

While initially hostile during the conflict with Ultron, Maximoff grew to have a strong bond with Hawkeye, who serves as a brotherly figure in her life, especially after losing Pietro. Hawkeye was responsible for encouraging her to act in two separate situations where she is overcome by her guilt, that being the attack on Sokovia and his attempt to extract her from the Avengers' Compound. In the aftermath of the Battle of Earth, where Hawkeye was in need of comfort after losing Black Widow, Maximoff was there, by his side, to quiet his worries.

Upon coming back to life and returning to Earth to fight against Thanos and his armies, Maximoff displayed an overwhelming vehemence towards the alien warlord, tempered by a subtle confidence. Her presence and movements were more deliberate and forceful, unlike the relative apprehension she displayed in her earlier appearances. This was most evident when Thanos was trying to break through her protections, Maximoff gave him an almost mocking smirk before forcefully swatting away his weapon with relative ease.
