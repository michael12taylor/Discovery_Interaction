<html><p>As the battle began, Gao launched a container of concrete blocks at the Defenders which Daredevil jumped over and engaged the others, while Jessica Jones kicked the blocks back at Gao, forcing her to destroy them all without touching them. Gao then stepped forward to engage in the fight herself, with Jones warning that she was stronger than she looked. Luke Cage first attacked Gao and was surprised to discover that she could more than match his strength. While Jones attempted to assist, Gao then threw Cage across the room before attacking her, proving to also be a match for Jones.

Gao is punched backwards by Jessica Jones
Gao used her Chi powers to knock back Jones and pinned Cage against the wall by slamming a car into him, Cage, however, managed to rip out a large steel pipe above his head, which he threw to Jones who in turn struck Gao with it, knocking her back. As Cage became distracted upon being attacked by Murakami, Gao continued fighting against Jones, managing to sneak behind her and sending her flying painfully backwards into a car. Jones soon managed to outplay Gao and knocked her back, leading to Murakami ordering Bakuto to set a fire which they used to get away from their now losing battle.

Finding the Bones
Gao and Elektra discuss the Dragon bones
Leaving the Defenders behind, Gao then traveled down to the depths of the pit where she found Elektra had successfully opened the door using Iron Fist, thus exposing the bones of the Dragons that had been hidden for so many years directly underneath the city. Gao then explained to Elektra that the Dragons had once roamed the land of K'un-Lun and now these fossils were all that remained. Although Elektra wanted Iron Fist dead, Gao recommended that they first remove the bones and then kill Iron Fist.

Gao explaining the fate of New York City
When Elektra asked where Murakami and Bakuto were, Gao then explained they were securing their escape from Daredevil, Luke Cage and Jessica Jones, explaining that they had held off their arrival for as long as they could. Although Gao claimed the Hand had already won the war, Elektra insisted that only she could decide when they had won. Gao then noted that once the bones had been removed from the underground caves, then the very foundation of New York City would crumble, resulting in the deaths of thousands or millions of innocent people, something which Gao showed no remorse for.

Gao encounters Iron Fist inside of the caves
While her men began removing the bones to create the Resurrection Elixir, Gao came across Danny Rand who was attempting to make his escape. Gao noted the power that the dragons had given them both, with Shou-Lao being the one who turned Rand into the Iron Fist, although Gao claimed his power was nothing, compared to eternal life. Disgusted by the treatment of these dragons, Rand told Gao that the elders of K'un-Lun had shown far too much mercy when they banished the Hand, causing Gao to smile at the concept that Rand would finally be the one who would right that ancient wrong.

Gao emotionally manipulating the Iron Fist
Gao claimed Rand was still as naive as when she had first laid eyes on him when he was a child, walking while holding hands with his mother. Gao hinted at a possibility that they could resurrect Rand's mother, smiling as she noted that Rand now stood before her, with nobody to help him as he tried to fulfil a prophesy or numb his own pain. When asked about her plans, Gao told Rand that it was time for New York to fall before she landed a strike on Rand. Gao noted the elevator was coming down with the Defenders, while Murakami captured Rand and Elektra awaited the arrival of his allies.

Destruction of Midland Circle
Gao uses Danny Rand as her own hostage
Gao then witnessed the elevator arrive with Jessica Jones having seemingly come alone to talk, confronting Elektra for making her life considerably more complicated and violent. However, while they were distracted by Jones, the Hand was suddenly ambushed by the other Defenders. During the chaos, Danny Rand managed to break free from Murakami's grip and then knocked Gao off her feet before she could do anything to stop him.

Gao is overpowered by the Iron Fist's strike
Working together, the Defenders managed to gain the upper hand and defeated much of the Hand's soldiers, leading to Gao stepping up with Elektra and Murakami to finish off the heroes. Gao dropped her walking stick and gathered all of her Chi, intending to deliver a blast of energy that would subdue all of the Defenders in one strike, with Rand then summoning the Iron Fist to stand against her. With both their Chi at full strength, Rand and Gao struck each other, with Iron Fist overpowering Gao and deflecting all her own energy back against her and her army, knocking them off their feet.

Gao watches Elektra fighting the Defenders
The Defenders then worked together to battle against all of the Hand's forces, with Luke Cage managing to subdue Murakami while Daredevil joined forces with Iron Fist and Jones to take out as many of the soldiers as they could, eventually becoming some of the only fighters still standing. Gao watched from a distance, hidden behind the bones of the Dragons, and watched as Elektra stepped forward and then battled against all of the Defenders alone, using all of her own skills as the Black Sky to beat them back until she herself was eventually overpowered by the heroes working together.

Gao witnesses her own impending demise
Gao witnessed Daredevil ordering the other Defenders to escape in the elevator while he stayed behind and fought against Elektra. As the battle came to its conclusion, Gao went over to Murakami, as he had become impaled on a steel bar due to having been thrown out of the elevator. Bleeding and in agony, Murakami asked Gao what was happening, as Gao said it was the end for them. With no escape in sight, Gao looked up and awaited the bombs to explode, which had resulted in Midland Circle collapsing above them as tons of concrete and earth came crashing down, seemingly burying them alive.

Personality
Madame Gao is a ruthless criminal, able to gain the complete trust of her subordinates and even make them blind themselves. While working with others, she is highly calculating and even spoke only Mandarin to make them underestimate her and let them believe she would not understand them without translation. She was quick to turn on her allies but seemed to respect Wilson Fisk more than the rest of his associates, as she warned him that he was losing himself on his mission. Despite this, she ultimately ended up trying to kill Vanessa Marianna as she considered her a distraction for him. She seemed to have some level of respect for Daredevil, however, and when their interests temporarily aligned, she willingly gave him information on the Blacksmith with the hope that both Daredevil and the Punisher would find and destroy her enemy.

Madame Gao speaks a lot in riddles and surrounds herself with an air of mysticism during her interactions.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Artificially Enhanced Physiology: Due to the usage of the The Substance synthesized from the bones of the Dragon, Gao's physical attributes are enhanced and enable her to live for more than four hundred years.
Enhanced Strength: Regardless of her smaller stature, Gao has shown to possess incredible strength during her fight against Luke Cage and Jessica Jones, as she was able to match both of their enhanced physical abilities.
Enhanced Durability: To be added
Enhanced Stamina: Gao has extreme stamina as she was able to withstand powerful blows from Jessica Jones without any lasting effects or injuries from the attacks. She is also highly resistant to drugs, as she has shown to be immune to Sodium Pentothal when interrogated. Being repeatedly exposed to similar drugs in the past has allowed her to develop a strong resistance to the effects of such substances.
Longevity: Gao's use of The Substance, a regenerative elixir synthesized from the bones of the Dragon, has enabled her an immensely long physical life, as she has stated she was alive in the 17th Century indicating she has lived for more than four hundred years. She could even have been alive for millennia, as the Hand was believed to be responsible for the destruction of Pompeii in 79 AD. Her immense longevity also allows her to remain physically very strong and fit despite her appearance of an elderly woman.

Her immense longevity also allows her to remain physically very strong and fit despite her appearance of an elderly woman.
Chi Manipulation: Gao has shown the ability to manipulate her Chi and expel it from her palms in a similar manner to Danny Rand's Iron Fist. This allowed her to generate and project great kinetic force through her palm. This allowed her to shove Iron Fist against a wall, blast through a door reinforced with a dumpster on the other side, and even shoot cars across the room with her palm attacks, it should be noted that her Chi is shown to be inferior than the Iron Fist.
Abilities
Master Martial Artist: As one of the leaders of the Hand, Gao is extremely well trained in martial arts, able to push Daredevil to the floor and sliding a few feet with a strike to the chest, although he was still suffering from his injuries taken in the duel with Nobu Yoshioka, her appearance as a frail old woman fooled Daredevil enough to catch him by surprise. He even spat out blood due to the force she applied into her hits.
Master Tactician: Due to her extended length of life, Gao has gained immense life experience and wisdom akin to a wise master strategist and had been shown to plan far in advance of her enemies, such as Daredevil or Iron Fist. Gao is also adept at using observations to deceive, persuade, and unnerve others, only requiring seconds to get inside a person's head.
Omnilingualism: Gao is fluent in Mandarin, English, and Japanese, and she claims to be able to speak all languages.
Equipment
Weapons
Gao stabs King through the back of the head
Cane Sword: Her walking cane has a hidden sword which Gao used to execute King for failing her.
Curved Blade: Witnessing Iron Fist summon the fist and soon to potentially kill Scythe, Gao threatened to kill Sabina Bernivig with a curved blade unless he had forfeited the Da Jue Zhan.
Handgun: Fearing that Iron Fist would soon be killed in the crossfire, Madame Gao took one of Sowande's soldier's guns and executed another man to stop him firing at the Defenders and Iron Fist.
Items
Steel Serpent: Madame Gao's faction of the Hand manufactures and distributes a synthetic heroin drug that she sells and exchanges through Wilson Fisk and his associates as well as sell under the guise of Rand Enterprises.
Poison: Many of the henchmen Gao yields in China have their weapons tainted with a lethal poison. She also provided the same poison in an agreement with Harold Meachum in killing two pilots and crashed the jet in the mountains. Upon its injection, it courses through the victim's bloodstream progressively.
