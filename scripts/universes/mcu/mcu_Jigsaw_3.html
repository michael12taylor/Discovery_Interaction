<html><p>Despite his initial reluctance, Russo decorated his White Mask with lines that represented how he saw his own facial scars as chunks of his flesh being missing. Once the mask was complete, Russo sat down with Krista Dumont once again as she complimented Russo on all his work with the mask, although Russo had insisted that the mask still felt the same regardless of that work he had already done to it. As Dumont then questioned how he was feeling mentally, Russo claimed that he still did not know.

Russo informs Krista Dumont about his life
Russo did however, inform Dumont that he had recently done a bit of thinking about the people he did know from the United States Marine Corps who he had described as his family, noting how he had never had this family before then and confirmed that he still missed them. Considering what to say for the moment, Russo told Dumont how he had been the best version of himself while part of the Marine Corps serving in Afghanistan, noting how they were a family and a force to be reckoned with. Russo commented on how he was fearless back then but now he was constantly afraid of everything in his dreams.

Russo laments on his ongoing nightmares
As Russo continued to get more distressed while describing some kind of a dark shadow constantly waiting for him in the edges of his mind, Dumont watched over him closely before Russo then made his confession that he believed that he did indeed deserve everything that has happened to him, although he still did not know what he had done to deserve it. While Russo bowed his head in quiet shame and despair, Dumont made her suggestion that Russo look into the possibility of his own redemption while promising that every person deserved this and had vowed to help him get there eventually.

Tormented by Dinah Madani
Russo being mocked by Dinah Madani again
Despite the good progress Russo was making, he still found himself being tormented by Dinah Madani, who went in his room at Sacred Saints Hospital and drank while watching him. Due to his trauma, Russo did not know who Madani was and why she hated him, with no memories of how he manipulated Madani and killed Sam Stein. One night, Madani had been once again watching over the sleeping Russo while drinking alcohol, before getting into his face and called him an asshole before walking out of the room, with Russo hiding the fact that he was actually awake.

Russo suffering from his nightmares again
As usual, every night Russo nightmares of skull imagery which had caused him to twist and turn during the night until he awoke with a start. One morning he awoke to find Madani looking down at him, clearly enjoying the fact that his dreams were causing Russo such distress. As Madani mockingly asked him about his dream, Russo questioned Madani about why she kept coming there, insisting that he did not know who she was, with Madani staying mostly silent before smugly acknowledging that Russo did indeed not know who she really was, which still continued to greatly unnerve Russo.

Russo questioning Dinah Madani's visit
They were interrupted by Krista Dumont's arrival who happily greeted Madani and introduced herself. Madani told Dumont her theory that Russo was faking his lack of memory, although Dumont insisted that Russo did not have the mental strength to do this. When asked how he was, Russo told Dumont that his face and head were hurting and explained that he had managed to get some sleep, all the while with Madani keeping a close watch on Russo. Seeing how uncomfortable she was making him, Dumont requested that Madani leave the room so that she could begin her daily therapy session with Russo.

Russo is talked down to by Dinah Madani
As Madani asked Dumont what she knew of all Russo's crimes, she insisted that she only cared about Russo's health and not his past, with Russo noting that they were rebuilding the jigsaw puzzle of his broken mind. Madani, however, continued to insist that Russo could not be trusted, also calling him the best liar that she had ever met throughout a career dealing with liars, with Dumont noting that her own work was to help patients like Russo discover the truth and then deal with that, with Madani telling her that Russo deserved to spend the rest of his life in prison for his crimes against her and all the lives he took before he had been injured and then taken into custody.

Russo asking Krista Dumont about his past
Turning their conversation around, Dumont noted how Madani also suffered her own head trauma which might be affecting her views, although Madani insisted that she was fine and left, telling Russo that she would return that night to watch over him. Once they were alone, Russo asked Dumont about what he did which had made Madani hate him, before becoming frustrated as Dumont reminded him that they had already discussed this. Russo was then freed from his bed restraints and asked pain relief. As Dumont left, she reminded Russo that he was the one who had shot Madani directly in the head.

Memories and Nightmares
Russo and Krista Dumont sit for therapy
As usual, Russo sat down beside Krista Dumont to begin his therapy session, with Dumont handing Russo his tablets to swallow, which he did while keeping his mask on and turning away to ensure Dumont did not see his face. As they began, Dumont commented that Russo seemed to be getting stronger, with Russo noting that while he was not allowed to run or use the gym at Sacred Saints Hospital, he was pushing himself to get stronger every day, although Russo had confirmed that the exercise was not helping him to get any sleep.

Russo answers Krista Dumont's questions
Dumont then asked Russo about his dreams, which clearly annoyed him as he noted how they been over this numerous times, to which Dumont asked him to indulge her regardless. Russo then her about his dreams in which he saw the Skull Imagery mixed with blood and the sounds of broken glass, although he still could not connect these images to the Duel at the Central Park Carousel that caused all his facial scars. Dumont began to ask Russo about how he felt during these dreams, asking if it instilled feelings of dread, although Russo insisted that they were just dreams and refused to answer.

Russo becoming tense from his nightmares
As Dumont continued to push him for a reaction, Russo had become annoyed and questioned why they kept doing this, to which Dumont told him that one day he would give her different answers and that would be significant. Clearly tense from all of these questions, Russo removed his hood and complained that his head was now hurting, as Dumont noted that the doctor had told her that there was no reason why Russo's head should hurt, to which the angered Russo furiously told her that it was not the doctor's face that was suffering and then questioned if Dumont thought that he was lying about his pain.

Russo talks about his past with Frank Castle
Taking a breath, Dumont questioned if Russo remembered how his face became scarred or who was there, although Russo confirmed that he did not. When Dumont had asked what was the last thing he remembered clearly, Russo told her that he remembered his time at the United States Marine Corps where he had been having fun with his fellow marines. Russo told Dumont how he remembered Frank Castle being there having fun with them, telling Dumont how Castle was his brother in arms, although Russo confirmed that he could not remember where Castle was now or what he was doing now.

Russo asking Krista Dumont about her work
Russo questioned Dumont over why all her questions about Castle mattered, telling her how he could no longer understand what was real and what was not due to his brain damage, telling Dumont that while he understood what he had been told had happened to him, he could not feel inside his gut that any of that was real. Continuing to complain about his headaches, Russo begged Dumont to bring him some Tylenol to relieve some of his pain, clearly not remembering that Dumont had already given him some more Tylenol which he had already taken just minutes earlier, which Dumont made note of.

Going on the Run
Sacred Saints Hospital Escape
Russo stresses over his nightmares again
Having had another night where he could only sleep for two hours, Russo sat down with Krista Dumont for their therapy, with Russo struggling to control his leg which continued shaking. As Dumont asked him what he did with their sleeping pills which had been provided to him by the doctors, Russo told her that he flushed them down the toilet, insisting he was trained by the United States Marine Corps on how to avoid sleep. Dumont asked if Russo was too scared to sleep due to his nightmares he continued to suffer from, to which Russo had then become clearly stressed.

Russo furiously questioning Krista Dumont
Dumont explained to Russo that their medical plan for him was that he would continue to be exposed to these nightmares with the hope that this would help him to eventually control them, which Russo still struggled to accept. Dumont then asked if she could look inside of Russo's notebook, which he allowed, as she found multiple sketches of the Skull Imagery which Russo had been haunted by for so long. While Dumont explained the concept of recalling his nightmares and why they were trying to understand his, Russo began pacing around his room, becoming considerably more anxious by the subject.

Russo furiously screams at Krista Dumont
Losing his temper, Russo slapped his notebook out from Dumont's hand and furiously questioned why Dumont would not actually help him. This action caused the New York City Police Department officers stationed outside the room to charge inside, believing that Dumont could be in danger, although she tried to tell them to step back while she attempted to calm Russo back down. While Dumont noted that what they were talking about was scary, Russo interrupted her by noting how she appeared to have it all figured out with her work with his White Mask and the notebook but he did not believe that Dumont really understood what was happening to him inside his head.

Russo brutally subduing police guards
With Dumont attempting to calm their situation down, she touched Russo's shoulder, only for him to slap her hand away, causing the officers to step in. However, as soon as those officers came close, Russo's military training kicked in as he swiftly and brutally subdued both of the men, using their own batons and tasers to his advantage as he managed to beat them both into submission, breaking the last officers hand and tazing his neck. With this violent action now done, Russo locked eyes with the now completely horrified Dumont, as he decided to take his chance to make his escape from the hospital.

Russo and Krista Dumont leave the hospital
Before the alarm was raised and now with the terrified Dumont by his side, Russo made his escape from Sacred Saints Hospital, keeping his arm locked around Dumont as they walked through the hospital's corridors and towards the exit, while still attempting not to cause any alarm from any of the other doctors who were still working. As they continued walking and using her keycard, Dumont was then greeted by another man, however, she managed to remain calm and not raise the alarm, despite Russo threatening her while they had walked past several more police officers who did not notice them leaving.

Russo goes to leave Krista Dumont behind
Once they finally got outside, Russo then furiously questioned why Dumont had not screamed or raised the alarm, to which she insisted that she simply did not wish for Russo to get hurt and insisting that Russo was still not ready to be on his own in New York City, as she asked him to trust her and to put things right if he went back with her. Believing this could not happen, Russo instead removed his face mask, finally revealing his scars, and told Dumont that there was no putting right what had been done to him. With that, Russo made his escape, leaving Dumont behind to be questioned by the police.

Getting into New York
Russo being mocked by a bully on the bus
Having gotten away from Sacred Saints Hospital, Russo had begun making the journey back towards New York City, with no idea about what he was going to do once he was there. Avoiding attention as best he could, Russo got onto a bus which drove him into the city, sitting quietly on his own and considering his next move. During this journey, Russo encountered Rick, a smug bully who took notice of Russo's dirty clothes and scarred face, comparing him to Edward Scissorhands, although Russo did not react to these comments.

Russo follows Rick from a downtown street
While Rick continued making his mocking comments, Russo recalled his escape from the hospital and Krista Dumont's comments to him, until Rick finally got off the bus, calling Russo a sad loser while he was getting off, shoving Russo's head on the way out as a final insult to him. Once Rick was gone, Russo then got to his feet and followed him off the bus, walking behind him into an empty alleyway where nobody could see them. Rick, however, sensing that somebody was following him, stopped walking and drew his switchblade from in his pocket, prepared to kill Russo if he dared to step closer to him.

Russo walking away from his murder of Rick
Despite having the switchblade still aimed towards him and with Rick questioning what he wanted, Russo remained calm and, with a slight smirk on his face, he stepped towards Rick. Using his skills gained from his time with the United States Marine Corps, Russo was able to swiftly disarm and kill Rick without raising the alarm. With the bully now dead, Russo proceeded to steal his jacket, jeans and shoes, as well as his sunglasses, walking away from Rick's corpse as he then continued making his way into New York, believing that his changed appearance could also help him blend into the crowd easier.

Russo goes out for a drink in New York City
Having made it into the city, Russo's first stop was to get into a bar where he ordered himself a drink and used Rick's switchblade to cut off his hospital tag, hoping that this would not draw attention to him. While the hockey match continued playing on the television above the bar, Russo ordered another drink. However, just as Russo took the drink he noticed that the television had changed to an update from WJBP-TV, showing his own face and announcing his escape from the hospital, much to Russo's complete horror as the reporter had described Russo as being armed and highly dangerous.

Russo miserably looking at his reflection
Clearly highly unnerved by seeing his own face being broadcast on the news with warnings to the New York City Police Department to be on the lookout for him, Russo's mind thought back to his previous therapy sessions with Krista Dumont, when she had first presented him with his White Mask and asked him to decorate it with the fact that he had wanted the world to see. With this thought in his mind, Russo looked at his reflection in the mirror behind the bar, studying the heavy scarring that covered his face. Not wanting to be seen by any customers or bar staff, Russo had then quietly left the bar.

Russo visits the Ray of Hope home at night
With nowhere to go and nobody he could turn to, Russo soon found himself traveling to where he had played baseball as a child while he was part of the Ray of Hope. While he sat and looked over the field, Russo recalled how he had once brought Frank Castle into this same location and told him about his time there playing with the children, and how he had been sexually abused by Arthur Walsh. Russo then stayed sat, looking over the field as he began to slowly fall to sleep, only to get sudden nightmares of Skull Imagery which snapped him back awake in an instant as he struggled to catch his breath.

Assassination of Arthur Walsh
Russo being reunited with Arthur Walsh
Seeking to confront the only man who he could actually recall having damaged him, Russo went to the home of Arthur Walsh, as greeted the shocked Walsh in his own kitchen. Not recognizing Russo, Walsh initially assumed he was being robbed and told Russo that he only had a television which was worth any money and told him to take it and leave without doing him any harm; however, Russo got onto his feet and claimed that he did not intend to harm Walsh, questioning if he actually remembered him or not as Walsh shook his head.

Russo explaining who he is to Arthur Walsh
Russo had then introduced himself to Walsh, explaining how he had been a member of the Ray of Hope group home, which seemed to remind Walsh of his sexual assault against Russo which was why he would be there. Seeking to calm the situation to ensure that Russo did not attempt to attack him, Walsh offered him some coffee, which Russo accepted while Walsh explained his new coffee maker which had a timer. Russo noted how it had been several months since he had been allowed to drink his coffee, with Walsh offering to make the coffee Irish by adding whiskey, which Russo had also accepted.

Russo reminisces his childhood to Walsh
Taking a sip of the coffee, Russo told Walsh how he visited the Ray of Hope group home and found that it had recently been turned into a new set of apartments, which Walsh did not actually appear to be interested in. Russo then explained how he had not known where to go, to which Walsh commented on how he was surprised that Russo had come to see him, noting that he did not believe that. Believing that Russo was looking for a handout from him, Walsh explained how it had been too late as the authorities had taken everything from him already and therefore Russo would not be his main priority.

Russo frantically talking with Arthur Walsh
As Walsh questioned what had actually happened to Russo's face, a comment which distressed Russo as he put his head into his hands and would only comment that an accident had caused all of his facial scars. While Walsh looked on nervously, the frantic Russo then got to his feet and told Walsh how his own head and brain had also been messed up as a result of his recent injuries but noted that he had still remembered what Walsh's home address was, despite his memory issues. Walsh then commented on how Russo had been a handsome child, noting that what had happened to his face was a shame.

Russo listens to Arthur Walsh's life in prison
The longer that Russo sat down with Walsh, the more agitated Walsh became, claiming that he had been a good mentor to all the children under his care until Tommy O'Neal had exposed him as a pedophile, resulting in his pension being stripped away and Walsh spending ten years in Sing Sing for his crimes. Rather than feeling any guilt, Walsh instead complained about how he viewed all this as unjust, claiming that he had dedicated his life to helping the children at Ray of Hope and did more than Russo's own mother had ever done for him as she left him behind in his care, a comment which alarmed Russo.

Russo is angrily yelled at by Arthur Walsh
Continuing to get more and more agitated, Walsh told Russo how he had always loved the children who were under his care, claiming that some of these young boys were willing to provide sexual favors in exchange for his love, something Russo had not done when Walsh had cornered him. As Russo sat in confused horror, while recalling these traumatic events in his youth, Walsh had reminded him of how Russo had attacked him with a stick when Walsh had assaulted him, while questioning why Russo had come to his home and noted that whatever bad things happened in Russo's life were not his fault.

Russo furiously looking up at Arthur Walsh
Attempting to regain some strength in this conversation, Russo then told Walsh how he had joined the Marine Corps after leaving Ray of Hope, only for Walsh to insult him and ask if a Hajji had destroyed his face, mockingly saluting Russo and thanking him for all his service. Laughing in his face, Walsh questioned if Russo had come into his home because he was less picky about sexual favors now that he was not so pretty due to his scars. In response, Russo had furiously attacked Walsh, eventually brutally murdering him by stabbing him in the chest with a wooden stick and leaving his bloody corpse.

Krista Dumont's Sympathy
Russo sadly reunites with Krista Dumont
Now covered in Arthur Walsh's blood, Russo went to the only person he could think could still help him, Krista Dumont. Knocking on the door of her Apartment, Russo had immediately identified himself before Dumont opened the door to find Russo standing before her in his bloodstained shirt. Clearly, both horrified and concerned by seeing him again, Dumont had first questioned if Russo was hurt, which he claimed to not be before she then invited him to come in.

Russo begging Krista Dumont for her help
Once inside, the stuttering Russo had explained that he did not know who else he could turn to in his time of need other than Dumont, who questioned how Russo had been able to find her apartment, to which Russo confessed that he had simply followed her home. Getting to the point, Dumont questioned Russo over whose blood he had over his clothes and hands, as Russo could not stop shaking and instead of answering, instead begged Dumont to help him. Sympathetic to Russo in his time of need, Dumont then helped him onto his feet and showed Russo to her bathroom so that he could take a shower.

Russo seeing Krista Dumont on her phone
Upon stepping out of the bathroom having washed Walsh's blood off his body, Russo found Dumont in the hallway, as she held her phone in her hand and debated with herself whether or not she should now inform the New York City Police Department about Russo's location, now knowing that he had just murdered somebody and was unsure of his intentions for her, now that he was in her apartment. Seeing this, Russo told Dumont, who was startled by finding him behind her, that he would not blame her if she called the cops to tell them where he was, knowing that in law this was the correct action to take.

Russo convinces Krista Dumont to help him
With his White Mask back in his hands, Russo reminded Dumont about how she had asked him what face he had wanted the rest of the world to see, noting that his current scarred face had everything that he ever did wrong written all over it. Russo told Dumont that he wanted to see the best version of himself in the mirror again as he questioned if Dumont even thought that this was even possible for somebody like him. Taking a moment to consider this, Dumont finally turned off her phone, indicating to Russo that she was now willing to take that risk for him, which was a massive relief for Russo.

Discussing Nightmares
Russo wakes up from another nightmare
Having been given somewhere to stay for the night, Russo attempted to get some sleep, but continued to be haunted by his dreams of the blood with Skull Imagery and broken glass. As the dreams got more intense, Russo was awoken by Krista Dumont as Russo launched up from the sofa with a start, now completely covered in sweat. Seeing his distress from all of his continued nightmares, Dumont then reassured Russo that he was now safe and questioned if he could still recall who she was, which Russo then confirmed that he could.

Russo becoming sick of the nightmares
Having been given some water, Russo then attempted to go back to sleep, which Dumont refused to allow despite Russo insisting that he did not want to have a discussion about all of his nightmares. When Dumont suggested that they engage with his feelings, Russo told her that he did not want to feel but kill those dreams. Seeing that Russo was becoming more distressed by the conversation, Dumont asked him to point out five blue items in her Apartment in an attempt to get him to calm down by focusing on something other than his feelings of anger, which Russo did and soon relaxed as a result of the test.

Russo calming down after his outburst
Taking a breath, Russo asked Dumont why she was helping him, to which she had simply stated that it was her job to help him. Russo, however, continued to ask why Dumont had not called the New York City Police Department who were still searching for him, but Dumont recommended Russo to focus onto their current environment in order to keep him relaxed and also stop him from losing control. Dumont told Russo that she did not know why she let him inside her home, other than that had seemed like the right thing to do in order to help somebody who she saw as needing somebody to care.

Russo thanking Krista Dumont for her help
Russo noted that she could now get into serious trouble for aiding a wanted fugitive like him, which Dumont acknowledged was the truth but did not seem to reconsider her decision regardless before Russo had requested more water in order to help him to relax. As Dumont took the glass and went to get some more water for him, Russo had thanked her before burying his head in his hands, thinking about his continued nightmares and his current situation. Russo then made the point to Dumont that she might be the last person alive who actually cared about him, something that had clearly distressed him.

In House Therapy
Russo is given some new clothes to wear
Despite being awake, Russo learned that he still could not get away from all his nightmares, as bloodied skull images continued to haunt him. While he struggled to cope with these going on inside his head, he was rejoined by Krista Dumont who had returned from buying him some newer clothes to wear, despite Russo noting that she did not have to do any of that for him, as Dumont noted that he needed something until they could figure out what they would do next.

Russo insists that no one understands him
Russo, however, told Dumont that he had no intention of going back to Sacred Saints Hospital ever again, noting that he would rather die than allow this to happen. Since Dumont ignored this, Russo insisted that this was the truth and claimed that Dumont did not understand how it felt. However, Dumont made it clear that she did understand, noting she knew Russo felt scared, helpless and hurt, which were all emotions which were felt by more people than just Russo, to which Russo noted that everybody had their own issues to deal with, although at least Dumont still remembered whatever had damaged her.

Russo listening to Krista Dumont's sessions
The same day, Russo took a shower in Dumont's Apartment and had stepped out to hear that Dumont was currently in a therapy session with Jake Nelson, another United States Armed Forces veteran who she was assisting with trauma. Russo listened as Nelson discussed his suffering and how he dealt with all this pain by drinking at his bar called McFeeney's. Russo listened to Dumont's advice to Nelson, in which she advised him to consider how he would accept these world shattering changes which had happened to him. Russo listened to all this advice and considered how these could impact his own life.

Meeting Jake Nelson
Russo sits down to drink with Jake Nelson
Seeking to gain a new ally, Russo went to McFeeney's where he then sought out Jake Nelson. Sitting down by Nelson, Russo was initially asked politely to find somewhere else to sit, but when Nelson saw his facial scars, he decided to stay quiet. Getting his drink, Russo asked Nelson if he earned his jacket by serving in the United States Armed Forces, which Nelson confirmed before asking if Russo could say the same about his facial scars, as Russo stopped himself getting angry and jokingly said that Nelson should see the other guy.

Russo making some jokes with Jake Nelson
Russo had then offered to buy Nelson another drink, first respectfully asking if a soldier like Nelson had wanted to drink with a member of the Marine Corps, which Nelson accepted. As the evening wore on, Nelson got considerably more drunk which he was concerned about, although Russo reminded him that he no longer had to wake up first thing in the morning to go out marching. Nelson questioned if Russo missed being a part of the Marine Corps, as Russo confirmed that he missed it every single day, noting that he mainly missed being around his fellow Marines who he had always considered his brothers.

Russo listening to Nelson's furious rant
Agreeing with his point, Nelson made the comparison between the friends made in the armed forces with the soft civilians they were seeing back in New York City, with Russo becoming briefly triggered when some girl's camera flash got in his eye, causing him to hear the sounds of broken glass and screaming from his incident. Nelson then offered Russo some cocaine, which Russo refused as he watched while Nelson took the drugs, with Nelson also commenting on how there was an entire army out in the streets of New York who were all feeling the same emotions of frustration as they were feeling.

Russo and Nelson sharing their respect
Nelson had continued to complain he had been hearing for a long time that all of the former veterans were the problem, while he now believed that they were not the problem but the bullshit they had all come back to. Russo then suggested that would happen if they just rose up and gave the entire world their middle fingers, which clearly excited Nelson. However, to Russo's surprise, Nelson revealed that he was fully aware of who he was sat next to. Reacting to this, Russo grabbed a glass as a weapon, only for Nelson to then claim it was an honor to meet him as the pair then shake hands with respect.

Living with Krista Dumont
Russo noticing Krista Dumont in her room
Russo later returned into Krista Dumont's Apartment where he tried not to cause too much noise as he entered, carefully opening and closing the door. Walking through the hallway while removing the jacket that had once belonged to Rick, Russo then stepped past Dumont's room and could not help but stop when he noticed that he could see Dumont was in her underwear as she changed. Dumont had soon noticed Russo watching her and then closed her door.

Russo tries to apologies to Krista Dumont
Hoping it makes it up to Dumont, Russo made some tea and waiting for her to come out of her room which Dumont accepted, noting that Russo had made it just as she liked it. As Dumont made a passive aggressive comment that he did not miss much, Russo attempted to apologize for what happened as he claimed that he was not actually spying on her. Dumont, however, made it clear that this was not what she was talking about as Russo realized she meant how he spied on her and Jake Nelson's therapy, although Russo expressed his belief that Dumont had actually wanted him to overhear their session.

Russo talks about losing his own company
Dumont, however, told Russo that he was taking too many risks and called his recent behavior self destructive, referring to how Russo had met with Nelson at McFeeney's. Hearing this, Russo questioned if Dumont was attempting to transform him as well, to which Dumont claimed that she simply believed that everybody was worth saving, even if Russo did not believe it himself. Hearing this, Russo noted how, since losing Anvil and everything he had been building, he had nothing left to lose, noting that Dumont still had a lot she could lose as a direct result of her recent decisions with assisting Russo.

Russo is ordered to stay in the apartment
Russo questioned why Dumont would take the risk of helping him, calling this action self-destructive, while also making the comment that whatever was driving Dumont to make these decisions, it was not all about Russo himself. Dumont then questioned where Russo had been the night before, to which he confirmed that he had done for a drink with Nelson at McFeeney's, with Dumont questioning if speaking to a fellow Armed Forces vet helped, which he confirmed as said they had a lot in common. Dumont told Russo not to leave again, or at least make sure that he was not caught if he did.

Russo routinely doing his physical exercises
Having been left alone in Dumont's Apartment, Russo began doing exercise as he had done back at Sacred Saints Hospital, doing his push-ups and feeling himself getting stronger, as a result, as he was now determined to regain all his former strength so he could begin rebuilding himself as the man he had been before his face had been disfigured, both physically and mentally. Once his exercise was done, Russo then found himself sneaking into Dumont's office and looking through all her belongings, eventually finding his therapy mask along with a revolver in her drawers, both of which he took for himself.

Russo looking through Krista Dumont's files
As Russo continued looking through Dumont's personal belongings, he had also found all of Dumont's paperwork regarding her therapy sessions with Russo, in which she had described his condition and expressed her belief that she could have done more good for him if she was able to begin her care earlier. As he had continued reading, Russo found that Dumont had often compared him with somebody known as KM, although there were no details about who KM was or how Russo had become disfigured. With nothing written about the cause of his scars, Russo had decided to find out for himself.

Confronting Curtis Hoyle
Russo meeting Curtis Hoyle for any answers
Seeking some answers on what had happened to him, Russo sought out the only man he thought might know the truth, Curtis Hoyle, who he tracked to an empty car park. Wearing his Therapy Mask and also armed with Krista Dumont's revolver, Russo had then revealed himself to Hoyle and forced Hoyle to remove his gun and eject the magazine and round while he still aimed the revolver at his friend. Hoyle confirmed that he had gotten the gun due to Russo's escape before Russo then lowered his own gun.

Russo revealing his scarred face to Hoyle
Russo commented on how his lawyers told him that he shot Hoyle, noting that he did not remember this, claiming that once he found out all he wanted to do was to call Hoyle and try and fix their friendship. Russo noted how he knew that Hoyle came to visit him once before, and claimed to be sorry, to which Hoyle simply suggested that Russo should turn himself over to the New York City Police Department and face justice for what he had done. Russo, however, merely laughed at this concept, removing his mask to reveal his scars and claiming that he had paid enough already through all of his pain and suffering.

Russo asking how he became disfigured
Russo then told Hoyle that he was never going back to prison, and promised that if anyone dared come after him then they would die as a result. Russo noted that he had heard how Hoyle had been asking over him and, since as far as Russo was concerned they were still brothers, he was finding this entire situation difficult to get his head around. Getting straight to the point, Russo then directly asked Hoyle exactly how he became disfigured and who was the person who had done it to him, becoming increasingly more enraged as Hoyle refused to answer him as he screamed the question once again at Hoyle.

Russo decides to leave Curtis Hoyle alone
As Russo continued to beg for an answer about how he gained his facial scars, Hoyle thought for a moment and had finally said that he wished that he could tell him the truth, but still refused to give Russo the answer that he was looking for. Taking a deep breath with tears in his eyes, Russo finally nodded and accepted Hoyle's answer. As the pair watched each other closely, Russo finally held his revolver in the air and claimed that he never had any intention of actually hurting Hoyle in spite of what had happened already, before putting his mask and hood back on, and making his escape from the car park.

Jigsaw's Campaign
Building a Criminal Crew
Russo hanging out with his crew for drinks
Having failed to get all of the answers that he had wanted from Curtis Hoyle, Russo went into McFeeney's in order to join Jake Nelson for a drink, finding Nelson was already drinking with several other veterans of the United States Armed Forces who happily greeted Russo as he was introduced to José and all the others, who all had a deep level of respect for Russo, much like Nelson did. Russo then sat down with his fellow armed forces soldiers and got himself a beer, taking a long and satisfying sip as he listened to their conversations.

Russo watches Jimbo's car being towed
Before long their conversation was interrupted as Jimbo returned to the pub and begged for their help, as his car was being towed away and he had all of his worldly goods inside it as Jimbo was currently homeless. Without any hesitation, Russo jumped into action with the other men, getting outside and immediately ordering Bobby and José to chase down the tow truck while he, Nelson and Jimbo got in front of it, with Russo putting on his Therapy Mask and readying himself for some long-awaited action while they chased down that tow truck as a military unit, ready to rescue all Jimbo's personal belongings.

Russo verbally threatens the truck driver
Getting in front of the truck with Nelson and Jimbo, they managed to get it to stop as Jimbo stopped in the middle of the road to tie up his shoelaces. Bobby and José then took advantage of this as they had snuck up on the driver before Russo dragged him out of his vehicle. With the driver on the ground, Russo began punching him repeatedly before threatening that if he did not stop fighting back and making noise then he would furiously break him in half. As the driver called him crazy, Russo grabbed Krista Dumont's gun and proceeded to hit him repeatedly in the face until Nelson then dragged him away.

Russo ordering Jimbo to leave New York
Having dragged the now enraged Russo away from the bleeding and unconscious driver, the crew then lowered Jimbo's car off the truck as he drove them to a safe part of New York City, as Russo advised Jimbo to get out of town, change his license plates and get to Texas to lay low for a while, noting that if Jimbo did not do this immediately then he would undoubtedly be tracked down by the New York City Police Department. Jimbo then thanked all of the members of their crew who had helped him out, making specific notice of Russo who wished him good luck before watching as Jimbo drove away.

Russo agrees to rob a bank with his crew
With Jimbo gone, Nelson and Bobby expressed their amazement at how easy that had been for them with their Armed Forces training, with Russo complimenting them on how they had performed. Nelson went on to claim they were wasting their time in McFeeney's every night when they could get jobs in protection, only for Bobby to then suggest that they should not work for anyone other than themselves, suggesting a potential bank which they could go out and rob with a small and highly skilled unit. Russo considered this concept and had smiled, excited by the idea of returning to combat with a crew.

Sleeping with Krista Dumont
Russo being questioned by Krista Dumont
Returning into Krista Dumont's Apartment, Russo arrived in time to overhear that Dumont was currently being questioned by Detective Sergeant Brett Mahoney about what she knew of Russo, although Dumont did not reveal that he was also in her Apartment. Eventually, Mahoney left their Apartment and Russo greeted Dumont, who then acknowledged that she should have told Mahoney that Russo was there and questioned if Russo would have killed Mahoney.

Russo questions Krista Dumont's situation
Dumont told Russo that she was now a criminal by lying to the New York City Police Department about protecting him, noting that she knew better than to do this. Russo had then questioned if Dumont thought that he might hurt her, to which she noted that he lacked impulse control, although Russo acknowledged that while he did, Dumont did not and therefore should be able to control her decision making better. Russo questioned if Dumont had believed that their situation could ever work out positively, noting that all the therapy in the world could not make anything right for either of them.

Russo demanding to know who KM was
As Dumont simply claimed that Russo knew nothing about her, he confessed to having gone through all her personal belongings and noted that from what he had found she did not seem to have much of a life outside of her work. Although Dumont tried to argue against this, Russo then questioned what it was that Dumont was trying to control, asking if it was his life which he claimed was never going to happen, while Dumont tried to calm him down. Russo questioned Dumont over who KM was, admitting he read his file and demanding to know if KM was another patient who Dumont tried to control.

Russo passionately kissing Krista Dumont
Losing control of his temper, Russo questioned if Dumont had failed to help KM, as much as she had failed to help him and others until Dumont responded by slapping him across the face. In a fit of rage, Russo then grabbed ahold of Dumont's face as he then aggressively pushed her down against the wall, pinning her down while Dumont desperately attempted to free herself by using a paper cutter to stab Russo in the hand, although Russo barely reacted to pain. As the pair stared at each other, in pain and with both fear and rage in their eyes, Russo took a chance and kissed Dumont, who kissed him back.

Russo having sex with Krista Dumont
Fueled by a deep lust for one another, Russo and Dumont went into her bedroom where they removed their own clothes and engaged in passionate sex with each other. As their sex continued, it became clear that both partners were sexually aroused by the combination of pain and pleasure, as Dumont bit into Russo's shoulder while he had found several scars over her body which he put pressure on, causing her to moan in delighted agony, with Dumont asking him to continue while Russo removed all Dumont's clothes and found another deep scar on her back which he pressed down on until they finished.

Russo asking about Krista Dumont's scars
With their passionate sex complete, Russo and Dumont had then laid back in her bed together and attempted to catch their breath back. As she lay her head onto his chest, Dumont asked Russo if she hurt him, to which Russo joked that that had clearly been the point, while Dumont noted that if somebody lived with pain for so long, they then started to miss it once it was gone until they found a connection with pain and pleasure. With Dumont's permission, Russo asked how she got her scars as she claimed she fell at the age of nine, claiming that it had been an accident as Russo decided not to ask more.

Walking Away from Dumont
Russo tells Krista Dumont that he is leaving
Once he got changed back into his clothes, Russo then found Krista Dumont as she was attempting to open the curtains to her windows and look out into New York City, something that was clearly causing her some emotional distress. Seeing him, Dumont asked where he was going, as Russo took a brief moment to consider his answer before telling Dumont how he had slept well the night before, without any more nightmares involving the Skull Imagery which had haunted him, allowing him to finally sleep without any terror for once.

Russo explains his reason to Krista Dumont
Hearing this, Dumont noted that this was good news as it was proof that they were making progress, to which Russo noted that he was feeling clear but claimed that this was not due to the therapy he had been having, but because of Dumont herself and the relationship that they were building. Russo then also claimed that a large part of his recovery was due to his newest band of brothers that he had made with Jake Nelson back at McFeeney's, although Dumont insisted that while he may feel safe out there, he still was not, to which Russo had still claimed that he did not care whether or not he stayed safe.

Russo theorized that the only reason why he had been scared was that he was trapped in a room at Sacred Saints Hospital with no clear way to regaining his freedom. Attempting to make himself clear, Russo noted how he had lost everything from his money, power and his own company with Anvil but still found it frustrating to not know how he had lost it all or even what it felt like to have it all. Russo then thanked Dumont for everything she did and noted that he should no longer stay at her Apartment, much to Dumont's frustration since she refused to be used and went to get her revolver from her drawer.

As she released the gun was missing, Russo showed Dumont that he had taken it in order to go out and threaten Curtis Hoyle, while noting how Dinah Madani pointed her weapon at him and he had shot her in the head. As Russo claimed that he was merely attempting to protect her, Dumont insisted that she would not be the reason that Russo died. Hearing this, Russo just answered by promising not to be the reason why Dumont ruined her life by continuing to try and protect him from the New York City Police Department, ignoring her pleads for him to stay while he turned around and simply walked out.

Training for the Robbery
Russo training his crew for their robbery
In order to prepare them all for the robbery of the ReadyQuick Check Cashing, Russo arranged for them all to reenact the robbery beforehand while in their hideout, all simply going through the motions in order to anticipate any potential scenarios which could disrupt their plan. During one run through, Mike was able to escape the room, much to their frustration as Geno began complaining about having to still do the rehearsals, although Russo insisted that they needed to know everybody's roles in the robbery.

Russo getting the latest update from Bobby
The crew were all interrupted by the arrival of Bobby who confirmed that everything was looking good from his end as the schedules had not changed at their bank. Noticing that Bobby was still wearing his uniform, Russo had then expressed his annoyance since it would be considered a serious risk for him to be seen wearing it and coming to their hideout, although Bobby insisted that he had already taken a bit enough risk with just offering the job to them. Russo then arranged another rehearsal for the crew to prepare for the robbery, giving them new positions to complete the run through, which Bobby complained about despite Jake Nelson repeating Russo's previous advice.

Russo accidentally harms Bobby in the face
As the crew did yet another rehearsal, things appeared to be going smoothly until Bobby attempted to steal Russo's weapon away from him, as Russo had immediately reacted by striking Bobby in the face. While everyone had reacted in complete surprise at this action, Russo commented that Bobby had been smart by making this move as it kept them on their toes in case anything went wrong, noting that somebody could try and be a hero and stop the robbery. Russo then offered Bobby his hand, which he refused and claimed that Russo hit like a member of the Marine Corps, which Russo was proud of.

Russo going over their plan of the robbery
While the crew prepared to get some sleep for the night, Russo told them to go over the plan one more time before they enacted it in the morning. Drawing lines on the ground, Russo explained how Todd and Mike would drive the cars allowing him to enter with Bobby and Nelson. Confirming that Geno knew that he and José would also be acting as backup, Russo became satisfied and told everyone to get some sleep. However, as Nelson complained of cold and requested to sleep at his own Apartment, Russo refused as he claimed it would be better for them all to stick together ahead of the robbery.

ReadyQuick Cashing Robbery
Russo heading out of the crew's hideout
On the morning of the robbery, Russo and the others had discovered that Jake Nelson had disappeared during that night and had not yet returned back into their Hideout. Eventually, the crew became tired of waiting for Nelson to return and Russo was forced into changing the plan for their job, recruiting Mike to take up Nelson's place as they headed out to begin their robbery. While they drove away from their hideout, Russo was unaware that Frank Castle and Curtis Hoyle had arrived in the Hideout, having just been searching for him.

Jigsaw and his crew begin their bank heist
Having donned his Therapy Mask in order to disguise himself, Jigsaw charged inside the ReadyQuick Check Cashing and then immediately assaulted the security guard by striking him on the head with his gun. With Bobby and Mike acting as his backup, Jigsaw demanded that all the customers and staff put their hands up and not move, leaving Mike to tie up their hands while Jigsaw turned his attention to those behind the counter, ordering the staff members to all move out of the way and pointing to Lillian, before calmly demanding that she press whatever button she needed to in order to then open the door.
