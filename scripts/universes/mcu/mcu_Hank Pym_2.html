<html><p>This distrust seems to be even higher towards the Stark family, as Howard Stark had been experimenting with Pym Particles. When Scott Lang asked to bring in the Avengers to help with Cross; Pym replied that he had spent much of his early life keeping Pym Particles out of the hands of Howard Stark and he would not let it fall into the hands of Stark's son Tony. Despite his disdain towards the Stark family, he still attended Tony Stark's funeral.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Although he possesses no innate superhuman abilities, Pym is able to use an EMP Communication Device to communicate and control various species of ants.

Insect Manipulation: Pym can communicate with ants, allowing him a rudimentary form of control over the insects. He uses electromagnetic waves to stimulate their olfactory nerve center and to mimic the pheromones of insect sized organisms using the EMP Communication Device. He could effectively project his will into ants and other insects, which influence their actions and behavior. As of now, he uses the device in the form earpieces similar to hearing aids or coiled communication earpieces. Scott Lang and Hope van Dyne also have these earpieces.
Ant-Man Suit Capabilities
Size Manipulation: Using his developed technology, Pym was able to reduce himself to approximately the size of an ant. He still maintained his regular sized strength and durability while in a reduced scale as the process amplifies the amount of force he can generate and increases his density. Additionally, the process of altering size compresses force and energy, manifesting as brief shockwaves of vibration around the target, which briefly augments his force and momentum as he returns to normal size.
Superhuman Strength:     Pym knocking down an enemy while shrunken   The process of size alteration grants him superhuman strength, which allowed him to defeat opponents of normal human size, as well as leap vast distances and great heights.
Superhuman Durability: The process of size alteration grants him superhuman durability, enough to survive falls from great heights and other impacts that would injure or kill even normal sized humans.

Abilities
Genius-level Intellect: Hank Pym is one of the smartest humans in the world, a scientist who focused on the development of a technology that other scientists were unable to replicate, such as discovering size-shifting Pym Particles.
Pym working within his laboratory
Master Scientist: One of the most brilliant scientific geniuses in history, Pym has tremendous knowledge and unmatched understanding in several fields of science, particularly entomology and atomic physics, but also chemistry. Indeed, he was considered the world's foremost entomology and nanotechnology expert and, was once recruited by Howard Stark and Peggy Carter as a consultant for S.H.I.E.L.D., in addition to him later also advancing the fields of nanotechnology, human enhancements, as well as molecular and atomic studies with his company Pym Technologies. Hence, Pym was able to discover and isolate the extremely rare inter-dimensional Pym Particles, as well as personally go on to harness them. Indeed, S.H.I.E.L.D. were unsuccessful in their covert attempt to replicate Pym's work, and even Pym's protege Darren Cross, a genius himself, took several years of trial and error to replicate it, and even then failed to realize the negative effects of using the formula without specialized protection.
Master Engineer: Pym is a brilliant engineer, especially in the field of nanotechnology, having personally created the Pym Particle-harnessing Ant-Man Suit, as well as the EMP Communication Device. Pym later worked with Scott Lang to render the suit capable of also increasing in size, and they were ultimately successful.
Expert Businessman: Pym is a highly trained businessman, having founded his own research company, Pym Technologies, which earned him a distinguished reputation in the technology community.
Combatant: Pym is a veteran; while rarely shown, he is a capable fighter even at his old age. As the Ant-Man, he used his compressed superhuman strength to his advantage against trained soldiers. In one swift move, he broke Mitchell Carson's nose with his own desk, and in a surprise attack punched Darren Cross in the face, surprising the latter with his strength.
Equipment
Other Equipment
Ant-Man Suit: Created by Hank Pym, the Ant-Man Suit is a suit that maximizes the use of the Pym Particles while also protecting the wearer from the negative side-effects of using Pym Particles.
Pym Particles: Pym Particles are subatomic particles that are capable of shunting or adding mass and reducing or increasing scale of any form of matter, compressing physical forces around such objects or organisms that they are applied to, as well as increasing density and strength of the subject. Pym created and harnessed the Pym Particles in an intelligence organization called S.H.I.E.L.D..

EMP Communication Device: Pym created a communication device through many rigorous tests to ensure its functionality. It appeared to work perfectly with all ants except for bullet ants, who seemed to ignore all the orders he had given to them. He eventually used it for his Ant-Man Suit to shrink down and talk to the ants on their level. They still continued to be defiant and chased him around until they ran into a centipede that attacked them. Pym and the bullet ants even worked together to defeat the centipede.
Pym Particles Disks: Pym created a complementary weapons technology for Scott Lang. When thrown, the discs release their Pym Particles upon impact with the target, triggering one of two effects depending on the type of disc used. The red disk shrinks an object or being. The blue disk enlarges any target, Pym uses these disks on a small tank.
Quantum Tunnel: Whilst on the run from the government, Pym and his daughter Hope van Dyne created a device that could safely transport matter in and out of the Quantum Realm. Pym himself uses this technology to transport the Quantum Vehicle, to save his wife Janet.
Quantum Vehicle: Used in conjunction with the Quantum Tunnel, the Quantum Vehicle allows the user to traverse the Quantum Realm with ease. Pym uses this technology to travel to Janet's location. The Quantum Vehicle uses tri-engines and is equipped with a location device and also infused with Pym Particles. It moves and controls much like an airplane, using a control stick.
Quantum Realm Exploration Suit: This suit allows Pym to safely traverse the Quantum Realm outside of the Quantum Vehicle. It mirrors his Ant-Man Suit design, however, lacks any self-shrinking capability. Pym uses it to save his wife; however, he removes the helmet, exposing himself to Quantum Energy, showing how vital the suit is when visiting the Quantum Realm.

Trivia
In the comics, Hank Pym was one of the founding members of the Avengers, and the creator of Ultron. Later, he became known as Yellowjacket before he passed Ant-Man mantle to Scott Lang.
In later comics, Pym became a member of the Illuminati, a group made of the smartest and most powerful characters in the Marvel Universe, including Black Bolt, Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, Medusa, Stephen Strange, and T'Challa.

Behind the Scenes
Originally, Hank Pym was mentioned by name in Thor when Erik Selvig tells Jane Foster about his contacts in S.H.I.E.L.D. This was cut because the filmmakers thought that it was too soon to mention him.
Nathan Fillion was in the running to play Pym before it was decided the character would not appear in The Avengers and never auditioned.
Before Michael Douglas was cast as Hank Pym, Sean Bean, Pierce Brosnan and Gary Oldman were considered for the part.
Michael Douglas' appearance in Wall Street was the primary reference for Hank Pym's youthful appearance in flashbacks.
While developing the story of Avengers: Endgame, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely considered having Hank and Janet van Dyne appearing with their Ant-Man Suits during the Battle of Earth sequence, but they ultimately scrapped them from the battle to not make it a "character orgy".
Michael Runyard was a stunt double for Michael Douglas in the role of Hank Pym.
