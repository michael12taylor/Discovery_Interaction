<html><p>Colt Law Enforcement Carbine: Castle was freed from his handcuffs by Amy Bendix when the Larkville County Sheriff Station was sieged by John Pilgrim's men, and took one of the rifles that sheriff Roy Hardin and his deputies were using. He killed all the mercenaries that had broken inside the station, earning Hardin's trust. Castle was then allowed to sneak into the woods, where he used the rifle to snipe on the two mercenaries that were about to throw a Molotov cocktail to the station. Castle's shot broke the bottle, burning them alive, and distracting the rest of the mercenaries long enough for him to ambush and kill everyone but Pilgrim. Castle obtained another of these rifles when he tried to capture Moke and ended up having to kill all members of Jigsaw's Crew that were raiding a warehouse. He took the rifle to rescue Amy Bendix when he learnt that there was a bounty on their heads, using it to kill all the mercenaries that were chasing her inside Shantel's apartment building. He mercilessly shot at all of them, finishing them off while ascending the stairs to make sure they were all dead. Castle obtained yet another one from the man standing guard at Valhalla when he wanted to infiltrate the compound. However, he fell right into Billy Russo's ambush and quickly lost the rifle.
Battle Arms Development Tanker: Castle took this assault rifle from John Pilgrim's bag of weapons during a shootout against him. They exchanged shots until Pilgrim took Amy Bendix as hostage. Then, Castle resorted to use the rifle as a blunt weapon against three police officers that arrived in the elevator, managing to escape from them but leaving the rifle behind.
Nemesis Arms Vanquish: Castle took this sniper rifle to a rooftop near Metro-General Hospital after he tried to kill Grotto inside of the hospital. Seeing that he would not catch Grotto up, he began to shoot the rifle hoping to kill him, until Daredevil confronted him and they began to fight.
Knight's Armament SR-25: Castle kept one of these rifles as part of the arsenal in his apartment.
Desert Tactical Arms Stealth Recon Scout: Castle climbed to a water tower to act as a sniper in his second attempt to kill Grotto. Knowing that Grotto was acting as bait for him, Castle created a diversion for the New York City Police Department and he began to shoot hoping to kill Grotto, until Daredevil attacked him a second time.
Barrett MRAD: Castle obtained this rifle as part of the secret arsenal kept by Ray Schoonover. Castle then followed police radio signals to the site of a massive hostage situation, arriving soon after Nobu Yoshioka had accidentally killed Elektra. As Yoshioka ordered the rest of the Hand members to kill Daredevil, Castle acted as Daredevil's backup, killing the ninjas and allowing Daredevil to finally defeat Yoshioka. Castle then respectfully said goodbye to Daredevil and left the scene with the rifle still in his hands.
Punisher takes aim at William Rawlins
Accuracy International AWSM-F: Castle took this rifle with him to El Paso in order to kill the last survivor of the Mexican Cartel. He patiently waited until his target arrived to Ju√°rez, and once the shot was clear, Castle fired a bullet that took a few seconds to reach the border, but ultimately killed the Cartel leader when it hit his head. Once he discovered the identity of Agent Orange, Castle also took the rifle in order to kill William Rawlins, and though the shot was perfectly aimed to Rawlins' head, the bullet could not penetrate the bulletproof glass. He also took it to the building in front of Curtis Hoyle's apartment, as he had anticipated that Billy Russo would attack Hoyle to drag him out, so he shot at Russo as soon as he had a clean shot, but did not manage to kill him, and was forced to unload the rifle to save Hoyle's life.
Ruger Mini-14: Castle ambushed Turk Barrett in order to obtain the weapons shipment from the Greek Mob that Barrett was supposed to receive. However, as Barrett had no other weapon available, Castle had to take a customized rifle with a synthetic pink stock that Barrett had acquired as a request from a gangster who wanted it for his daughter. Castle took the rifle to their hideout to show it to David Lieberman, but he never put it to use.
Punisher retrieves his machine gun
FN M249 SAW: Punisher hid this machine gun in a box of packing peanuts, in preparation to face Billy Russo's Anvil soldiers' ambush on Micro's hideout. After he received heavy fire to his vest and was forced to discard his shotgun, he took cover behind bigger crates to detonate an explosive and draw out the rest of the soldiers. He began to fire upon his attackers, but quickly dropped it to instead kill a hidden soldier with his combat knife, and steal his gun instead.
Sage Control SL-6 Rotary Launcher: Castle took this grenade launcher when he went to confront Billy Russo in the carousel of Central Park. As he approached, Castle shot a few grenades to the air in order to distract Russo with their explosions, letting him approach Russo and start to shoot at him with his rifle, having discarded the launcher.
Dillon M134 Minigun: Castle obtained a handheld version of the minigun as part of the secret arsenal kept by Ray Schoonover. He then took it when he went to torch his former house, carrying it while the house began to be engulfed by flames.
M2 Flamethrower: Castle obtained this flamethrower from the weapons cache he stole from the Greek Mob, and used it during the robbery in order to deal with the two Department of Homeland Security agents that were following the weapons shipment. As they openend the truck, Castle used the flamethrower to force them to drop their weapons and jump into the water so that he could escape.
Ka-Bar: Talking with Zach Lieberman about his behavior, Castle found that he carried the Ka-Bar. Castle told Lieberman about combat knife he picked, before used it to threat Lieberman. Castle carries this type of combat knife which he uses on multiple occasions. He even uses it as a makeshift throwing knife.
Baseball Bat: Castle went to Clint's store and bought some supplies from him. As Castle attempted to leave Clint offered Castle some child pornography. This disgusted Castle and he picked up a baseball bat which he then used to beat Clint to death with.
Sledgehammer: Six months after killing all the gangs involved in his family's death, Castle retired from vigilantism and got a job as a construction worker. Castle used a sledgehammer for his job and would often work late into the night hammering down concrete walls by himself, quickly earning him the ire of some of his coworkers. Castle would later use his sledgehammer to rescue Donny Chavez from Lance and his lackeys.
Other Equipment
Police Radio Frequency Scanners: At his hideout, Castle was in possession of multiple radio frequency scanners that allowed him to listen in on the police and stay a step ahead of their plans, as well as to find leads on his enemies.
Daredevil's Billy Club: Castle temporarily used Daredevil's own Billy Club against him during their second fight, though losing it once Daredevil gained the upper hand against the fight.
Punisher wearing his bulletproof vest
Punisher's Vest: Wearing a Bulletproof Vest on his chest and torso, which had helped him absorb the impact from firearm projectiles and shrapnel from explosions, Castle painted a huge skull over the vest's front in order to put fear into the hearts of his enemies as he slaughtered them.
Vehicles
Frank Castle's Van: Planting the explosive in his own van, Castle informed Finn Cooley that he left the money stolen from the Kitchen Irish inside. While two gangsters went to take back their money, Castle exploded the van, killing them. Later, Castle obtained another van that was used in the chase for the Dogs of Hell. Later, together with Micro, Castle utilized the van to arrive to different places, such as Kentucky, Fort Bryon and Wilson Residence.
1968 GT Ford Mustang: Instead of his van, Castle used Micro's car to drive to the docks where Turk Barrett was spotted. Realized that Barrett had not any useful weapons, he drove back to the hideout.
Homeland Security Helicopter: To be added
Facilities
Castle revisiting his old residential home
Castle Residence: Castle lived with his wife and two children in the primary household in a suburban neighborhood of New York City. In the wake of Massacre at Central Park, Castle demanded George Bach to bring him to his house and then it was abandoned for several months before it was explored by Karen Page. Preparing for leaving the city, Castle returned to his house last time before burning it down.
Cerberus Squad Compound: During the rotation in Afghanistan, Castle was stationed at the military base in Kandahar, as well as other members of the Cerberus Squad. Following the Ambush in Kandahar, Castle and the remained members of the squad was evacuated to the base for medical treatment.
Punisher's Hideout: Orchestrating his own crusade against the New York criminals, Castle lived in a small apartment that was used as his improvised base. Hideout later was found by the Kitchen Irish members which found a map on the wall with marked Central Park and realized where he was going to be.
Frank Castle's Apartment: Assuming his new identity as "Pete Castiglione," Castle lived in the apartment within New York City. Learning that he was watched by Micro, Castle changed his appearance and left his apartment.
Castle and Micro inside the hideout
Micro's Hideout: Teaming up with Micro, Castle had come to live in the abandoned power station that Lieberman used as his hideout. Inside the hideout, Castle placed his van and the weapons stolen from the Greek Mob. Using Sarah Lieberman's phone, William Rawlins traced the location of the hideout and Billy Russo sent Anvil tactical unit to eliminate Castle and Lieberman. However, Castle knew about the attack and sent a trap, killing all Anvil agents sent after him. When Castle was captured by Anvil, Russo ordered agents to bring Castle to the hideout where he was tortured by Rawlins before he was killed by him.
St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church: Following the arrest of Russo and regaining his freedom from the CIA, Castle agreed to attend a group therapy session for former United States Armed Forces soldiers ran by Curtis Hoyle. Arriving to the church, Castle joined other veterans and admitted to being scared for not knowing what the rest of his life holds for him.

Prisons
Castle is imprisoned in the Ryker's Island
Ryker's Island: For his crimes, Castle was imprisoned in the Ryker's Island where he was approached by Wilson Fisk. Fisk offered him to kill his fellow inmate Dutton who ruled the whole prison, claiming that he most likely knows about the Massacre at Central Park. However, after the death of Dutton, Fisk locked Block A where he confronted and killed several inmates before he was overpowered by corrupted prison guards. Realizing that chaos, caused by Castle's actions can make the situation in the city more valuable, Fisk ordered his men to free him from the prison.

Trivia
In the comics, Francis Castiglione is a veteran of the Vietnam War, who returned home only to watch his family die for witnessing a mob execution lead by the Costa family, a crime family in the Maggia. He vowed to kill criminals, disregarding his identity as Castle and calling himself only the Punisher. Castle appears as an adversary of Spider-Man, when he targets the hero for inadvertently causing Gwen Stacy's death, they later become situational allies after a misunderstanding.
Punisher is the character with the second highest body count in all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, being directly responsible for the deaths of 65 known characters.
Punisher was originally set to be introduced in a post-credits scene at the end of first season finale of Daredevil, where he kills Leland Owlsley, with the character's face unseen but his skull insignia appearing. But the idea was dropped because the way Netflix airs its series episodes.
Castle is a fan of Earth, Wind & Fire, Bruce Springsteen, Wu-Tang Clan, and Shooter Jennings.
Castle can play the guitar.
Castle is, or at least was, Catholic.
Castle is a fan of the New York Rangers.
Castle likes pancakes and Lombardi's sausage and mushroom pizza.
Castle is left-handed.
Castle is 6'3". Though this is Castle‚Äôs height in the comics, in real life, Jon Bernthal is 5‚Äô11".
Castle weighs 225 lbs.
Behind the Scenes
Jon Bernthal made audition tapes together with Tom Holland while filming Pilgrimage, both landing their roles of Frank Castle and Peter Parker respectively. In the comics, Punisher first appeared as an adversary of Spider-Man.
Punisher in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the fourth live-action incarnation of the character, following incarnations portrayed by Dolph Lundgren, Thomas Jane and Ray Stevenson.
Steven S. DeKnight said this version of Punisher would be "completely the Marvel version," as previous portrayals did not appear under the Marvel Studios / Marvel Television banner. He also felt Bernthal's Punisher would not be as "graphically violent" as in Punisher: War Zone.
Douglas Petrie stated that Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver was an influence on the character, as well as current events, saying, "Taking lethal justice into your own hands in America in 2015 is tricky shit. We have not shied away from the rich complicated reality of Now. If you've got a gun and you're not the police you're going to incite strong feelings."
Jon Bernthal added that "This character has resonated with law enforcement and military ... and the best thing about him is that if he offends you, he just doesn't care."
Jon Bernthal added that "This character has resonated with law enforcement and military ... and the best thing about him is that if he offends you, he just doesn't care."
Petrie and Marco Ramirez talked about creating their version of the character following the film versions, with Ramirez saying, "even if you know the character, you‚Äôve never seen him like this. That was the big thing we wanted. There are four movies, eight hours and four actors. We‚Äôve seen this guy. We think we know who he is, but even we learned that he‚Äôs so much more." Petrie said, "We hope to make people forget what they‚Äôve seen before, whether they‚Äôve loved it or not."
In order to get in the correct mindset to portray Castle, Bernthal trained with military members, along with receiving weapon training. Bernthal also "had to put myself in as dark of place as possible" to connect with "the emptiness inside" Castle, and isolate himself, including walking across the Brooklyn Bridge to get to set "to shed any outside influence of joy."
Describing the character, Bernthal said, "As a man who put his [life] on the line and really went through the ultimate sacrifice for this country in his involvement in the military. He‚Äôs a guy who brought the war home with him [in] the worst possible way. There are a lot of iterations of this character and in all of them it‚Äôs a man who‚Äôs gone through this unbelievable trauma and what‚Äôs interesting about our take on him is how this trauma reshapes his own philosophy."
Bernthal also talked about the character's 'superpowers', saying, "If I got one thing from the comics, I think, as far as superpowers... his superpower is his rage. His superpower is that he is not going to quit, and he is going to go forward no matter what. And that's as human and grounded a quality as I think as this sort of genre could have."
Eric Linden, Spencer Mulligan, Justin Eaton and Can Aydin were stunt doubles for Jon Bernthal in the role of the Punisher.
Rocky Kellon Smith was a stand-in for Jon Bernthal in the role of the Punisher.
