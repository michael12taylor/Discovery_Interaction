Daniel Thomas "Danny" Rand is the son of Wendell Rand, the CEO of Rand Enterprises, and his wife Heather. Rand lost his parents in a plane crash which resulted with the young Rand being rescued by monks and taken to K'un-Lun where he trained and eventually took the title of the Iron Fist. Rand returned to New York City to claim back his name and soon fell into conflict with the Hand when he had learned that Madame Gao was using his company to sell the Steel Serpent around the world. Rand challenged Gao and soon joined forces with Harold Meachum and Bakuto. However, Meachum and Bakuto turned against Rand, while intending to use the power of the Iron Fist for their own purposes, forcing Rand to defeat them both. Thinking that he had fulfilled his mission to defeat the Hand, Rand returned to K'un-Lun with Colleen Wing, only to discover that the gate to the city had closed while he was gone.

Searching the globe with Wing for any new leads to the Hand, Rand's one lead was assassinated by Elektra, prompting him to return to New York, where he was introduced to Luke Cage by Claire Temple. Together, along with the assistance of the vigilantes Daredevil and Jessica Jones, Rand soon fulfilled his prophecy to finally destroy the Hand, saving New York while apparently losing Daredevil in the process. Honoring his ally's final wish, Rand decided to continue protecting New York as a vigilante. Rand then teamed up with Cage in order to put an end to Bushmaster and his criminal actions within Harlem, as Rand then assisted Cage not only as a warrior, but also as a mentor in order to help Cage become a superior hero.

While he continued to use his powers to protect New York City, Rand was eventually reunited with Davos, who sought his revenge against Rand for abandoning K'un-Lun and leaving it to be destroyed. With the aid of both Joy Meachum and Mary Walker, Davos kidnapped Rand and performed a ceremony to steal the power of the Iron Fist from him, before also crippling Rand. With help from Colleen Wing and Misty Knight, Rand regained his strength and went to stop Davos from continuing his murderous rampage through Chinatown as he slaughtered the members of Yangsi Gonshi and Golden Tigers, eventually deciding that Wing should take over the power of the Iron Fist instead. Upon defeating Davos and giving the Iron Fist over to Wing, Rand left New York with Ward Meachum to investigate Orson Randall, while regaining the power of the Iron Fist.

Biography
Early Life
Privileged Upbringing
Born to Wendell and Heather Rand, Danny Rand had lived a comfortable life with his family within New York City. He was homeschooled as a child and had several different teachers, along with his mother. His father was close friends with Harold Meachum, who several years earlier he had partnered with to create Rand Enterprises, which had allowed the Rands and Meachums to amass a huge fortune over the years, and due to the friendship of their parents, Rands and the Meachums often spent time together. While walking with his mother, Rand tried to pull away as she attempted to hold his hand, unaware that Madame Gao was observing them.

Friendship with the Meachums
Rand and his family at a holiday vacation
During his childhood, Rand had spent most of his time interacting and playing with Harold Meachum's two children, Joy and Ward, although Rand was often tormented by Ward who would lock him in freezers, put dead frogs in his food and kick him in the testicles. Despite Ward's frequent bullying, Rand still looked up to Ward like an older brother.

Rand being bullied by Ward Meachum
When Rand Enterprises needed a new commercial, Rand was convinced to take part when his father promised to take him to the circus in Madison Square Garden afterwards as he sat next to his Heather and Joy, as Rand had admired the acrobats. The Rands and Meachums had often went on traveling together while also doing commercials. Rand also befriended Jeri Hogarth while she worked as an intern at Rand Enterprises. He affectionately nicknamed her J-Money when she bribed five dollars to convince Rand not to tell her boss after she cursed Margaret.

Becoming Iron Fist
Plane Crash
Rand is involved in a terrifying plane crash
Rand was traveling with his mother and father on a Rand Enterprises business trip towards Anzhou. During their flight, however, they then became involved in a plane crash in the Himalayas. As their pilots were unconscious and the plane began to fall apart, Rand was struck in the head by a piece of the plane. Rand's mother went to his aid, checking that he was okay; however, just as she did, the roof of the plane was ripped off and she was sucked outside, seemingly falling to her death in the mountains while the horrified Rand could now only watch helplessly and scream out for his mother.

Rand surviving the horrific plane crash
As the plane neared the ground, Wendell told him that he loved him before they Crash Landed. Miraculously, Rand had survived the crash that killed both his parents. As he crawled across the freezing landscape he found both the pilots who had some strange markings on their necks before finding his father's body. Rand was unable to locate his mother and, while he stayed by Wendell's side, he was found by Chodak and Tashi who took him to K'un-Lun, in order to save him from freezing to death while trapped in the snow.

Trained as a Warrior
Rand is beaten by the Monks of K'un-Lun
In the years to come, Rand would experience strict and harsh conditions while he had lived with all the monks of the Order of the Crane Mother, sleeping on a dirty mat and traveling a mile uphill to get daily rations of water each morning, although he soon became accustomed to the environment despite the vast difference compared to his life in New York City. He would then train and spar with other students of K'un-Lun, during which any failures to fight led to beatings by his masters to teach him endurance, while his victories would then earn him being taught the next fighting styles.

Rand befriending another student, Davos
While training under the watchful eye of Lei Kung who adopted him, Rand excelled with his studies and soon became a skilled warrior, while mastering every fighting style taught to him. Rand also became close friends with Davos, as they shared experiences growing up in the harsh environment of K'un-Lun. While Davos took care of Rand while he got used to the cold air, Rand showed off skills of his own which he had learned from New York City, including making paper airplanes which amazed Davos. Rand and Davos would sometimes sneak away to eat a donkey rather than the vegetables they grew.

Rand playing some more games with Davos
While inside their room, Rand and Davos had amused themselves by playing their game of noughts and crosses which Rand had learned while growing up in the United States of America, Davos once again lost and complained that it was a stupid game, as Rand bet Davos that if he won again then Davos would have to do all of his knuckle pushups for him, which Davos had simply refused to bet on, claiming that Rand was so skinny that he needed to do more pushups rather than him. Rand, however, noted how Kung taught them that having a sharp mind could be better than the sharpest of swords.

Rand discusses being the Immortal Iron Fist
The friends then discussed the Iron Fist and the teachings of Kung and Yü-Ti, as Davos had noted that the Iron Fist must strike without mercy or hesitation, claiming that the Iron Fist not only guarded the pass to K'un-Lun but also killed them against all of their enemies. When Rand questioned if he would actually be able to kill, Davos had insisted that once he was the Iron Fist, he would then hunt down and destroy their enemies, which included the Hand. When Rand then questioned if Davos would be willing to kill him if he joined the Hand, Davos had claimed he would not as they were still brothers.

Rand watches as Davos is hit by his mother
They were then interrupted by Priya, who insisted that if Rand joined the Hand then Davos must kill him without a second thought if Davos wanted to be a true warrior for the Order of the Crane Mother, while then also telling Rand that he would actually never be granted their permission to undergo the Trial of Shou-Lao due to his compassion which she claimed was deficiency of character and would not make him a true warrior of K'un-Lun. Priya then whipped Davos' hands for speaking out of turn, making Davos recite what made him worthy of becoming the Iron Fist while Rand watched on from the side.

Rand grows up to become a skilled warrior
Rand and Davos continued to share many experiences together such as stealing wine from Kuo and replacing it with water as well as stealing apples from Q'uon or stealing Kuo's cart to go and peek at some of the village girls, only to find Kung bathing in the nude. Rand's years of training under the guidance of Kung and the Order of the Crane Master eventually allowed him to become one of the most skilled and respected warriors in K'un-Lun. However, Rand often meditated in the snowy mountains, thinking of his mother and how he would finally return back to New York someday.

Duel of K'un-Lun
Rand preparing himself to challenge Davos
During Rand's time as a student in K'un-Lun, he eventually learned of the position of the Iron Fist, a title of considerable power and great importance throughout the realm, passed down through generals of the Order of the Crane Mother and tasked with protecting K'un-Lun from their sworn enemies, the Hand. Rand grew ambitious and set out to prove himself a worthy enough warrior of gaining the power of the Iron Fist, competing with several other students, including Davos, onto reach his goal of gaining this power. Despite many of the monks there believing that Rand being an outsider made him incapable of earning the title, Rand's determination grew further.

Rand and Davos fight against each other
Years later, both Rand and Davos were ready for the trials to confront Shou-Lao and become the Iron Fist. Rand competed against many of his fellow students until only he and Davos were the only candidates left. Sitting down with Davos, Rand's final trial took place at a temple of K'un-Lun and was witnessed by Lei Kung, Yü-Ti, Priya and other masters, settling a ritual of bringing down ropes that tie each other up. Donning the Iron Fist masks, Rand and Davos were told that if they were only allowed to leave until the opponent yields or dies.

Rand defeats Davos in the Duel of K'un-Lun
Once the fight had settled, Rand and Davos fought for hours in the temple halls, however, both were equally matched and both received heavy injuries. Davos managed to gain the upper hand when Rand found himself unable to hit his friend when Davos took off his mask. Despite seemingly on the losing side, Rand stubbornly refused to give up and Davos hesitated to deliver the killing blow and pleaded for Rand to yield. Eventually, Rand led Davos into the light of the dawning sun to blind him and gained the upper hand.

Rand walks away from Davos after the duel
With multiple blows towards Davos, Rand ended the stalemate with a resounding blow to the face, having Davos to land on the ground, seeing his friend lay wasted on the floor, he took an opportunity to pin him down so that he won't back down. As Rand held Davos to the floor, Rand demanded him to yield, only to get silence in response, ready to give the final punch, Lei Kung ruled Rand as the victor, much to his shock, he let go of Davos and continued off on his path. Exhausted and injured, Rand left as the victor and prepared to face Shou-Lao the Undying.

Trial of Shou-Lao
Rand prepares to battle against Shou-Lao
Eventually, Rand was given the opportunity to gain the power of the Iron Fist, being then sent to battle Shou-Lao which had lived within a Cave outside the city. It ferociously guarded a brazier containing its heart, which had mystically been removed from its body. In their battle, Rand grabbed the serpent's body, which bore the scar that imprinted itself upon Rand's chest.

Rand finally gains the Power of the Iron Fist
Rand plunged his hands into the now unguarded brazier containing Shou-Lao's molten heart when his hands had shone with a quasi-mystical force and he finally earned the title Iron Fist. With his trial succeeded, Rand had gained his power and the Mark of Shou-Lao onto his chest before he was left unconscious outside the cave. Laying down near the cave where fought Shou-Lao, Rand was eventually found by Davos who woke him up, as Rand then used his new Chi power to summon his Iron Fist.

Iron Fist is helped onto his feet by Davos
Still confused and disoriented, Rand looked at his new power, lighting up with his fist on command when he awoke from his slumber, while Davos helped him onto his feet, telling him that the rest of the people of K'un-Lun is now in need to know that Rand completed his trail and is now the carrying the power of the Iron Fist. Rand told his friend that the trial was not what he thought it was, while Davos told Rand that it wasn't what any of them thought. Davos reminded Rand that he has a duty now, and Davos promised Rand that he would be by his side, as it was what they promised each other from training to guard the city of K'un-Lun.

Returning back to K'un-Lun, Rand entered a temple in the city and was recovered back to normal stability as he felt completely in pain and was carried by Davos when he defeated [Shou-Lao from his encounter with him, feeling exhausted, he decided to lay down and rest along the hallways so that he could breathe and take a moment to look upon his profound powers. Laying down on the ground, Rand channels his chi with his fist to look at his power, demonstrating to Davos, as they both looked at it with amazement that Rand had succeeded and become K'un-Lun's Immortal Weapon.

Longing for Home
Iron Fist stands guard outside of K'un-Lun
Having finally become Iron Fist, Rand spent his time watching and guarding over the pass to K'un-Lun alongside Davos in case of an attack by the Hand. As much as Rand tried to uphold his duties, part of him felt unsatisfied and empty as gaining the power of the Iron Fist did nothing to solve his problems. Davos tried to reassure him that at least he knew what the rest of his life was meant to be, although Davos' reassurance did nothing to solve Rand's inner struggle. Rand had begun to look and wait for a sign to his questions.

Rand sees the way out of K'un-Lun is open
One day while he guarded the gate, Rand then spotted a hawk flying further and further away and realized that the passage to K'un-Lun was finally open once again for the first time since his Plane Crash. Taking this hawk as the sign had showed him a path and wanting to desperately return home to New York City and get the answers to his questions, Rand made the choice to leave K'un-Lun behind. On the journey back to the United States of America, Rand used his martial arts skills to fight in illegal fight clubs to earn money and eventually stole John Anderson's passport in Morocco to get back into America.

Returning Home
Rejected by Friends
Rand seeing the Rand Enterprises Building
Having finally left K'un-Lun behind him, Rand had then returned all the way back to his own original home of New York City still barefoot, delighting at being home at long last while he looked at some of the new technology that was in shop windows. Having ventured a while through the streets while still listening to Outkast on his IPod Classic, Rand eventually found the Rand Enterprises Building and looked upon its great height. Smiling, Rand informed a Peanut Vendor that the building belonged to him, however, the vendor did not believe Rand was telling the truth due to his lack of shoes.

Rand tells the desk manager about himself
Upon entering the building and looking around the reception for the first time in over a decade when he had ridden his skateboard down the hallways, Rand went straight over to the female receptionist, commenting that June obviously no longer worked there. Rand then enthusiastically asked to meet with Harold Meachum so he could explain where he had been for so long. As the receptionist looked confused, Rand then introduced himself as Danny Rand, the son of Wendell Rand, much to the disbelief of the receptionist who claimed that meeting with Meachum would be impossible.

Rand taking a long look around the building
Being promised this would happen soon, Rand walked around and found a new high tech screen which gave the history of Rand Enterprises, which Rand took great delight in watching as it showed the history of work his father and Meachum had done together. Much to Rand's displeasure, the security arrived and escorted him out the building, believing Rand to be nothing more than a crazy homeless man who was attempting to gain access to the building, shutting the door behind him despite Rand insisting that he did belong and they should call Meachum in order to finally confirm this fact.

Rand subduing the security guards by force
Refusing to take no for an answer, Rand reentered the building only to be stopped once again by the building's security who insisted that he leave. Telling them that he only wished to speak with Meachum, Rand was then forced to use his own martial arts to fight past them, having little trouble despite the security being armed with batons as Rand was able to trip them up without causing them any other real physical harm as he then made his way through the doors while more security guards, including Shannon, came and had failed to stop him, before Rand got into the elevator and had then gone upstairs.

Rand reunites with Joy and Ward Meachum
While in the lift, Rand sneakily used another employee's keycard to gain access to the top floor. Ignoring Megan's attempts to stop him, Rand then succeeded in reaching the office floor and entered Meachum's office, only to find Ward Meachum was sitting in his father's former office. While Rand and Ward questioned who the other was, Rand reunited with Joy Meachum who he enthusiastically greeted although they were untrusting of Rand who they did not recognize. As Ward prepared to call security, Rand insisted he was telling the truth, while requesting to speak with their father.

Rand attempting to explain who he really is
The siblings refused to believe that he was Rand without any proof, noting how all the Rands had been killed in the Air Crash fifteen years earlier. They then informed him that their father Harold had passed away from cancer sixteen years earlier and demanded that he leave, as Ward continued trying to get through to security. As Joy tried to get Rand out of the office, Rand still tried to insist he was being honest, suggesting they go to the Stage Deli and talk things through so he could explain, although Rand nearly came to blows with Ward when the latter furiously threatened and insulted him.

Rand is escorted out of the Reand building
When Joy once again told him to leave, Rand had briefly lost his temper with the situation before he apologized, resulting in Ward stepping between Rand and his sister and informing him that this would be his final chance to get out of his office. As security finally arrived on their floor and held him at gunpoint, Rand was forced to leave, despite insisting he was not dangerous. As Joy considered calling the New York City Police Department, Ward suggested they not and instead personally threatened Rand to stay away, before Rand was taken out of the building, which he reluctantly did.

Reconnecting with New York
Rand revisiting his own former residence
Having left the Rand Enterprises Building, Rand had then instead returned back to his old home that is now a private residence of the Meachums, finding an old craving he and his mother and father had previously done on the concrete. Wishing to take a look around his former home, Rand first rang the doorbell but then, when he got no answer, instead resorted to first trying to find a key before he then climbed up the side of the building with considerable ease and broke in without being seen by anyone due to his speed.

Rand meditates before Joy Meachum's dog
While he was quietly exploring the house, Rand had also found a photograph of both Ward and Joy Meachum at a party together. Despite being as quiet as possible as he continued exploring, Rand eventually encountered Joy's pet dog, Toro, who was attempting to protect his master's home from the intruder. Remaining completely calm, Rand had still managed to keep Toro from attacking him by quietly bending down to Toro's level before calmly using his Chi to sedate the pet before locking it inside Joy's study where he would not be able to raise the alarm about Rand having broken in.

Rand reliving his memories of the house
Rand then found a photograph of himself with the Meachum family on holiday together when they were young, with Harold Meachum included in the picture. When he reached the roof of the residence, Rand had briefly reminisced a memory in his youth when he played board games with Joy and Ward, seeing how Ward was not very kind towards him, insulting Rand's own relationship with his parents while also blaming him for making a mess which Ward had actually been responsible for. Rand then eventually left the residence when Joy had returned, ensuring that he made no noise on his way out.

Rand being introduced to Big Al in the park
With no money currently on him, Rand was forced to take refuge for the night in Central Park where he was greeted by a homeless man named Big Al, who mistook Rand for another homeless man due to his lack of shoes and had noted that he had not seen Rand around in New York City before, to which Rand noted that he had been away for quite some time. During their chat, Al had mistaken Rand's iPod Classic for something he had stolen, noting that he had managed to steal an iPhone off somebody and used it to find his sister in Florida, offering that he could look somebody up if Rand wanted.

Rand starts to learn what he had missed
Rand asked Al to use the internet to research himself, learning from a report from the New York Bulletin that officially he had died with his family during the Air Crash fifteen years earlier. Rand then learned from him about Harold Meachum's passing due to cancer, with Al noting that Meachum had a big funeral which even their major had attended. Big Al then offered a few advice on where to get shoes and food, believing Rand to also be homeless, as Rand noted that they were similar people with their desire to help people before Rand had then gone back to sleep for the night outside in the open air.

Speaking to Joy Meachum
Rand attempting to speak to Joy Meachum
The next morning, Rand went back to former home once again in order to encounter Joy Meachum and try once more to convince her that he was telling the truth about who he was. However, once again, she had refused to believe that he was her old friend Rand and was mortified that he had discovered where she lived. Despite Rand promising he would not harm Joy, she still called for her security, promising that if he touched her then she would have him arrested by the New York City Police Department and sent to jail for harassment, promising him the maximum penalty.

Rand being rejected again by Joy Meachum
Rand tried to convince Joy by stating facts about himself, including how they both grew up together in New York City and had played football together, where Rand had acted as their goalie, although Joy insisted that he could have looked this information up online, much to Rand's great frustration. Rand desperately pointed to the fact that Joy was now living in his former home, to which Joy then answered that it was now her home. Joy was further displeased when Rand inadvertently told her about his recent break-in to her home by noting how scary Toro was, which had utterly horrified Joy.

Rand after leaping right over a passing taxi
Knowing that talking to her further was meaningless and seeing that her car was just coming around the corner with her armed security team, Rand started to leave while he considered how he would next attempt to convince them that he was telling the truth about his own identity. However, as Rand stepped out into the road, a taxi come out and was about to hit him; but Rand proceeded to use his Chi energy and instead had effortlessly jumped over the car and evaded it, much to Joy's stunned surprise before Rand then took off running before he could then be arrested for once again harassing Joy.

Meeting Colleen Wing
Rand meditating alone within Central Park
Following his disappointing efforts to reconnect with his former life and get the help of Ward and Joy Meachum, Rand had then begun meditating in Central Park in order to restore his Chi and find his own inner peace so that he could eventually continue trying to prove his name without losing his temper yet again. While he had performed his martial arts in order to relax his mind and body, Colleen Wing handed Rand some change in a cup, having once again been mistaken for being homeless.

Rand introduces himself to Colleen Wing
Looking to see who had given him the money which he did not want or need, Rand then spoke with Wing, while she was putting adverts on a wall. Rand tried to give the money back by noting that he had not actually been busking, but Wing insisted that he keep it as she continued putting up her posters and trying to ignore Rand while he had continued trying to speak with her. Rand then watched as Wing continued putting up ads for the Chikara Dojo which she ran, noting that her ads were for self-defense and martial arts classes which she taught.

Rand asking Colleen Wing to give him a job
Intrigued, Rand then took notice of Wing's surname and spoke with her in Mandarin for a moment, which had impressed Wing until she stopped him as she then noted she had not spoken that language since she was a child. Apologizing, Rand had then asked if he could get a job at her dojo, intending to get a job teaching kung-fu classes, however, Wing declined the offer as she believed he had only wanted a job cleaning up and she explained that she actually already had an employee to do this. Before Rand could correct Wing on what he had meant, Wing said her goodbyes and then walked away.

Threatening Ward Meachum
Rand getting inside of Ward Meachum's car
Taking to desperate measures, Rand had located Ward Meachum at a parking lot of the Rand Enterprises Building and had proceeded to enter his old friend's car, insisting that he was only trying to talk to him and this was the only way that he could think of to get his intention. Rand managed to force Ward to enter the car by driving it, noting that he had not driven since his father had taught him when he was a child. As they continued driving, Ward had demanded that Rand to stop and when he did not comply, he pulled a gun and once again insisted that he pull over the car.

Rand's life is threatened by Ward Meachum
While Rand still tried to get Ward to talk to him, Ward informed him that he could talk only with the New York City Police Department as Rand finally stopped the car. Increasingly frustrated by the anger and hostility that he has been receiving from his former friends since arriving back in New York City, Rand asked for Ward to put the gun away. When he replied by cocking his gun, Rand disarmed him with ease and briefly aimed the gun directly at Ward's head before then discarding it, while becoming increasingly annoyed that Ward would threaten his life rather than hear what he had to say.

Rand furiously drives Ward Meachum's car
Ward asked about what he wanted as Rand had explained that he wanted answers about what happened to him, his parents and to Rand Enterprises. Ward simply retold the Air Crash, still insisting that he was not Danny Rand and that he could have no proof of identity as Rand had no living relatives and could not give a fingerprint scan as he did not do one before disappearing. Despite Rand's attempt to convince Ward by mentioning their past together, he still remained unconvinced by anything that Rand was saying and insulted Rand by speculating what it was like inside of his crazy head.

Rand choses to run from Ward Meachum
Angered and frustrated, Rand started driving the car at high speed in the parking lot, comparing the intensity of the situation to watching his mother die and knowing that he and his father would be next. In his anger, he nearly drove the car off the building and managed to stop in time when Ward finally called him by his name, causing Rand to crash safely into the barriers. Distraught about his actions, Rand distressingly apologized and started moving out of the car. Before leaving, Ward grabbed him by the arm and warned him that this was not over, although Rand agreed with that statement.

Rand is reunited with Big Al in Central Park
Returning to Central Park, Rand was joined by Big Al who gave Rand a sandwich from an Italian Deli. They talked for a while about how society had gone wrong over the centuries as Big Al asserted to Rand that he stayed true to his purpose as a hunter-gatherer. Rand cited a quote from Buddha about how one's purpose in life was to find it, to which Big Al asked what Rand's purpose was. Rand then responded that his true purpose was to protect K'un-Lun from all oppression and to honor the sacrifice of Shou-Lao the Undying. Big Al then simply responded that Rand should still have fun.

Attack on Danny Rand
Rand greets Colleen Wing at Chikara Dojo
Rand headed over to the Chikara Dojo to find Colleen Wing as she was finishing her lesson. Once her students left, Rand greeted Wing again who questioned if he was there for a lesson, as Rand offered her the two dollars back and questioned what he could get for that, to which Wing suggested he get a coffee. Unsure of his intentions, Wing tried to get Rand to leave, but he said that he wished to challenge the dojo's master much to Wing's great confusion. She refused the challenge and continued trying to get Rand to leave by explaining she was closed.

Rand asks Colleen Wing for a job once more
Rand tried to advise Wing that she should begin to teach Kung-Fu in order to get more students into the Dojo, although Wing insisted that she did not want the hassle, but Rand suggested that he could teach some classes for her, noting that this is what he had meant when he had previously asked for a job. Wing questioned where Rand had trained, to which he answered K'un-Lun. When Wing then asked Rand where she could find K'un-Lun, Rand had refused to tell her, noting that she would not actually be able to get to K'un-Lun from New York City, which finally got onto Wing's nerves.

Rand is calmly threatened by Colleen Wing
Irritated and not believing what he was saying, Wing sternly asked Rand to leave, placing her wooden practice sword to his neck and when Rand pointed out that it did not even have an edge, Wing noted that he did not want to know how much it would hurt when she hit him across the face with it, to which Rand noted that Master Lei Kung had already demonstrated this to him on multiple occasions. Finally taking the hint, Rand apologized to Wing for any inconvenience and headed for the exit: However, as Wing felt sympathetic to Rand, she still gave him a pair of shoes to wear.

Rand defending himself from an ambush
Outside the dojo, Rand sat down to put his new shoes on but was soon attacked by Shannon who was armed with a bayonet, however, Rand quickly retaliated and had soon managed to force the man on the ground with considerable ease. Recognizing Shannon as the security guard from Rand Enterprises who he encountered earlier when he arrived in the Main Building, Rand then witnessed Shannon pull out his gun and try to kill him to which Rand quickly disarmed him. When he had realized the man was not alone and that they were armed with their own guns, Rand quickly ran away for his life.

Rand is forced into running to save his life
Managing to avoid the gunshots fired at him, Rand then managed to get over a high wall in an effortless leap, as Rand managed to get away from his attackers for a brief time but knew that they were still attempting to locate him. When one of Shannon's men also got over the high wall, Rand came back and knocked him to the ground with a well-placed kick, before taking his gun and removing the bullets and throwing it away. As he continued to run for his life, Rand was unaware that Wing had also come to his aid and had witnessed his skills before watching him disappear into the crowds.

Rand hides his face underneath a mask
Running into New York City, Rand had then come across the Chinese New Year Parade going on in the middle of Chinatown, which Rand used to his advantage as he blended into the crowd and used Wing's two dollars to buy a mask to hide his face. Knowing that he could still be spotted due to his clothing, Rand remained on high alert and soon spotted Shannon within the crowd still searching for him. As another one of Shannon's men almost located him, Rand used all his martial arts skills to evade detection by quietly spinning around him and then disappearing back into the crowd, which left the man confused.

Rand gaining the edge over his attackers
Getting to a high advantage point, Rand managed to drop down behind one of Shannon's men and attacked him, using the chaos of the Parade and the loud music to hide the attack. Knocking him into a building, Rand had no issue with subduing the man who he had taken completely off guard with his speed, knocking him unconscious before taking his gun away, removing all of the bullets and throwing it away. Having taken down his pursuers, Rand had then continued blending into the crowd and became determined to find out who it was who was currently attempting to have him assassinated.

Rand finally manages to subdue Shannon
With only Shannon left hunting him down, Rand continued walking throughout the crowds of people until he felt Shannon's gun being pressed against his back. Reacting with incredible speed, Rand then threw away Shannon's gun and punched him multiple times in quick succession, dazing Shannon. Throwing him down a flight of stairs, Rand interrogated Shannon by twisting his arm backwards and had eventually learned that it was Ward Meachum had sent them with the intention of killing Rand in order to gain his silence. Having learned this, Rand knocked Shannon unconscious and made his escape.

Rand finds Big Al lying dead in Central Park
Returning back to Central Park having escaped from hostiles, Rand looked for the one person who had actually been kind to him since returning back to New York City. However, finding his tent was now empty, Rand had then eventually found Big Al lying near a tree, lifeless having overdosed on drugs as Rand pulled the heroin needle out of Big Al's arm. Rand briefly mourned his new friend and said a few passing words in tribute which he had learned during his time in K'un-Lun. Before leaving his friend's body behind, Rand had then noticed a Raven tattoo which was on the Big Al's arm.

Tricked by the Meachums
Rand greets Joy Meachum inside her office
Seeking answers about why he had been attacked the night before, Rand returned to the Rand Enterprises Building, sneaking past the guards and heading downstairs to take a different way upstairs which he remembered from his youth growing up in the building. Rand waited until Joy Meachum had returned to the office and was horrified to find Rand waiting for her, when she questioned how he got in, Rand answered that the building was like a second home to him.

Rand has a cup of tea with Joy Meachum
Rand informed Joy that Ward Meachum had attempted to have him killed the night before, which Joy refused to believe, and asked if she was ready to talk and Joy finally agreed, although she still warned that she had mace in her purse and could press a single button and have a guard inside the room immediately, to which Rand had again promised that he would not do anything to harm her. Joy poured a cup of tea for Rand and they started talking as Rand explained how he was attacked by Shannon and two more men armed with guns, but Joy had still remained highly skeptical of this concept.
