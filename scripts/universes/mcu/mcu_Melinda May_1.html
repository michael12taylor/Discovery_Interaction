Professor Melinda Qiaolian May is a highly-skilled S.H.I.E.L.D. operative, nicknamed The Cavalry. A veteran pilot and soldier with years of experience and a good friend of Phil Coulson, she withdrew from field duty after an incident in Manama, Bahrain which left her mentally damaged. However, she returned to the field when Nick Fury asked to her to secretly assemble a team for Coulson and to monitor his recovery process. She worked with the team on all their missions. When the HYDRA Uprising began, her true role on the team, to be Fury's eyes and ears on Coulson, was discovered, leading to a rift between her and the team. Feeling unwanted, she left, searching to find out the truth behind Coulson's resurrection. She found the truth and brought it back to Coulson. She helped the team stop John Garrett and went with the team to the Playground to help restart S.H.I.E.L.D., under newly promoted Coulson.

As Coulson's unofficial deputy, May helped Coulson in fighting the forces of HYDRA led by Daniel Whitehall and dealing with Coulson's growing obsession with the alien writing. After the Battle for the Kree City in which HYDRA was dealt a heavy blow and resulted in Skye gaining superhuman abilities, May helped them all to deal with the situation the best they could. When another S.H.I.E.L.D. faction led by Robert Gonzales emerged and occupied their base, May helped Coulson to escape, but later accepted a position on Gonzales' board. When the two factions united, May became a member of Coulson's council of advisors. Following the War Against the Inhumans and the Kidnapping of Bobbi Morse, she retired from S.H.I.E.L.D. for a short time to be with Andrew Garner.

May's retirement would be short-lived, however, as Lance Hunter would request her help in getting revenge on Grant Ward by killing him. Though the duo would be unsuccessful in that mission, May would fully return to S.H.I.E.L.D. to stop Ward and a newly-discovered HYDRA cell led by Gideon Malick from bringing HYDRA's founder, an Inhuman named Hive, back to Earth. During HYDRA's campaign, May would also face a new threat in the form of an Inhuman named Lash, who was killing other Inhumans. May would soon discover that Lash was her partner, Andrew Garner, and would make the difficult decision to shoot him, though he would survive. HYDRA's plan to bring Hive to Earth would culminate in Ward's death at the hands of Coulson, though Hive would possess Ward's body and return to Earth. May would work against Hive as he plotted to turn the Earth's population into Inhumans loyal to him, a plan that would end in his death as well as that of Andrew Garner's.

Following the relegalisation of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the appointment of Jeffrey Mace, May was given the task of rebuilding and training the new STRIKE team. During one of her missions, she was touched by Lucy Bauer, a person with ghost-like powers, causing her to have a mental breakdown that would've lead to her death. Jemma Simmons and Holden Radcliffe managed to save her life at the last moment. Prior to S.H.I.E.L.D. victory on Eli Morrow, May was incapacitated and kidnapped by Aida and was replaced by an LMD of herself. After several escape attempts, May's mind was trapped inside the Framework, a virtual reality where she lived as a HYDRA agent. With the help of Daisy Johnson and Simmons, May finally escaped the Framework, only to face the threat of the now-organic Aida. May and her team managed to kill Aida, however S.H.I.E.L.D. was now an illegal organisation once again. May and the team would go to a diner to have a meal before being arrested, however a mysterious man would capture them and send them through a monolith to the year 2091.

May and the others found themselves in the Lighthouse, a bunker used to contain the rest of humanity following Earth's destruction. May was captured by the Kree, who ruled over the station, and sent to Earth's surface. There, she would be saved by the man who sent her to 2091, a Chronicom named Enoch/Destroyed Earth who had sent them there as part of his plan to prevent the destruction of Earth. On the surface, May would meet Robin Hinton, who had been raised by May in Hinton's past. May and her team would successfully return to the present, and immediately begin work on preventing the destruction of Earth. However, they would come into conflict with another HYDRA cell lead by Air Force General Hale, an alien Confederacy, and Glenn Talbot, who had infused himself with Gravitonium and gained superpowers. As this transpired, May and her team would learn that Phil Coulson was dying as a result of a deal he made with the Spirit of Vengeance to defeat Aida. S.H.I.E.L.D. would be forced to kill Talbot, succeeding in preventing Earth's destruction. May would retire from S.H.I.E.L.D. again to be with Coulson during his final days. May would be there as Coulson peacefully passed away.

May returned to her service within S.H.I.E.L.D. under Alphonso Mackenzie's directorship, who assigned her to the new STRIKE team. Later, S.H.I.E.L.D. encountered mercenary group led by Sarge who had an incredible resemblance with Coulson. With May's strong desire to find out about Sarge, S.H.I.E.L.D. apprehended Sarge and temporarily allied with him in the fight against Izel, a non-corporeal entity that seeked to help her species invade the universe. Eventually, May found out that Sarge was an entity from a non-corporeal dimension that possessed a replica of Coulson's body which corrupted his memory. May, together with Mackenzie and Sarge headed to the Temple of the Forgotten to stop Izel from unleashing her realm's powers on Earth, however, Sarge took Izel's side and killed May, throwing her body into her realm. Due to the nature of Izel's realm, May survived her fatal injury and managed to kill Izel in the fight before Jemma Simmons put May in a cryo-freeze chamber to save her.

May was taken onto the Zephyr with the team, which then travelled through time to 1931. Though May was left in the Zephyr to recover, she would escape the cryo-chamber prematurely and meet a new LMD of Coulson. Upon her escape, she would realise that she was no longer capable of feeling emotion but could feel the emotions of others when touching them, which she would later discover was due to her time spent in Izel's realm, where emotion did not exist. May would be debriefed on the team's new mission: travel through time to prevent the Chronicoms from altering the past to erase S.H.I.E.L.D. from history. May's new empath powers would be vital in helping the team detect Chronicom impersonators of real humans as the team jumped through the decades. Though the Zephyr would be stranded in 1983, Leo Fitz would arrive to bring them back to 2019 to fight the Chronicom fleet. May and the Coulson LMD would defeat the Chronicom leader, Sibyl, finally putting an end to the Chronicom threat. After the team's victory, S.H.I.E.L.D. would be rebuilt and May would retire from field work to become a teacher at S.H.I.E.L.D.'s new school, the Coulson Academy.

Early Life
Childhood
May as a kid
Melinda May was born to William and Lian May. At age seven, she became an ice skater and admired the famous ice skater Dorothy Hamill, winning many awards in competitions. However, she found the ice was too hard when she fell, so at the age of 12, she became a martial artist, where the floors were padded.

Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
May eventually joined S.H.I.E.L.D., believing that the agency was the best defense of the United States of America and the world against any possible threat. Trained by the best S.H.I.E.L.D. had to offer, May became an ace pilot and a weapons expert, a soldier who could perform above and beyond the call of duty. She was one of the few S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who had more black belts than Natasha Romanoff, whom she met and befriended.

May met Phil Coulson during a mission in which the two were paired up together. During the mission, their commander sent them to a coffee shop in Sausalito on a retrieval operation without an exit strategy. May wound up in the bay for five hours until Coulson eventually fished her out. May often dated several men at this time, but ended the relationships constantly as she found difficulty in dating civilians, due to the secretive nature of her job. May and Coulson were sent another mission where they had to pose as husband and wife, where Coulson took a long time to unhook May's bra, much to her amusement.

After developing a romantic interest in Coulson, May asked to be assigned to aid Coulson during his mission to retrieve an 0-8-4 from Russia. After she successfully managed to steal it from the SVR, May returned to save Coulson and informed him that she was dating a psychiatrist. May still retained her feelings for Coulson, and she smiled as Coulson suggested that they could get together if her current relationship did not work out. May ended up falling in love with the psychiatrist, Andrew Garner, and the two eventually married and eloped.

Coulson would describe May as warm, fearless and not afraid to break rules. May was quiet, but not above pulling pranks on her fellow agents. She also met Alexander Pierce, one of the leaders of S.H.I.E.L.D. As rookie agents, May and Coulson often talked of being able to pick their own operations and to call their own shots without the bureaucracy and red tape.

The Cavalry
May with her husband Andrew Garner
In 2008, May, Phil Coulson and a team of agents were dispatched on an "Index Asset Evaluation and Intake" (or "Welcome Wagon") mission, investigating Eva Belyakov, a newly discovered powered individual with superhuman strength. They tracked Belyakov to Manama, Bahrain, where things immediately spiraled out of control; Belyakov, aided by various Bahrainian gangsters that she seemed to be controlling, took a young civilian girl and every dispatched S.H.I.E.L.D. agent except for May and Coulson, hoarding them inside of a warehouse.

May is forced to kill a young girl
As she was unable to call in any backup, May took it upon herself to solve the problem. She went in by herself with only a knife, crossing off the controlled gangsters and Belyakov herself. However, she learned that the girl, revealed to be Belyakov's daughter Katya, was the one controlling people using a sensory manipulating ability. May witnessed the girl use her powers to kill the remaining gangsters, so she was forced to execute Katya to prevent her from doing the same to the captured S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. The incident scarred May mentally and earned her the nickname "The Cavalry" within S.H.I.E.L.D., a designation she despised.

May working in Administration
May never spoke of what happened during the incident, but it changed her. The warm, rule-bending nature of her personality seemed to be gone, despite Coulson's efforts to draw it back out. Her marriage with Garner also slowly fell apart as a result of her distance, eventually ending. Soon, May withdrew from combat duty, retreating to a desk-bound administrative position within the S.H.I.E.L.D. bureaucracy.

The story of "The Cavalry" became a legend at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy, with the story growing bigger and more inaccurate with each new class.

Coulson's Team
Back in the Field
May was approached by Nick Fury himself and ordered to be his eyes and ears on the newly resurrected Phil Coulson. May's orders were to report to him directly if Coulson showed any side-effects or dangerous behavior after his treatment with the alien GH.325 drug. Fury believed that given their shared history, Coulson would recruit her for his new team.

Phil Coulson recruiting May for "his team"
To aid in her mission, she put together a team of agents that may be necessary to treat or act on Coulson, selecting Jemma Simmons, Leo Fitz and Grant Ward. Coulson was then given specific mission parameters and was maneuvered into picking May's choices. As expected, Phil Coulson came to the office where she worked and asked her to join his team. Still haunted by her past experiences in the field, she was genuinely reluctant to return to combat, but she agreed when Coulson told her that he just needs her to "drive the Bus." 

May slowly returning back to combat duty
However, fieldwork is not always a stable environment. May was angered after seeing inadvertent combat in Peru, but her skills helped save her team and re-take the Bus from Camilla Reyes's hijackers. During the action in Malta, May initially assumed that she would be on the strike team to rescue Franklin Hall, to her dismay. When Coulson informed her that he was going in with Grant Ward instead, May expressed doubt, stating that fieldwork and specialist work were two different things. During the operation, May was frustrated at being stuck at the backend of the op, where she could not do anything to help her team. Upon Coulson's return, May informed him that she would report the next time combat duty came up.

New Actions
May confronting Akela Amador
May returned to combat duty without hesitation. She acted swiftly (and without authorization) to apprehend Akela Amador before she could complete her mission in Minsk, Belarus. In Hong Kong, she participated in the attempted rescue of Index listed pyrokinetic Chan Ho Yin from his captors in the Centipede Project. When Chan started to use his powers against the S.H.I.E.L.D. team, killing Quan Chen, May injected Chan with a dose the Centipede Serum, causing an explosive overdose.

May wielding the Berserker Staff
She lived up to her nickname of "The Cavalry" when Grant Ward and Leo Fitz were stranded in the middle of a hot operation without an extraction plan along the South Ossetian border. She piloted the Bus without authorization into an active hot spot where she and her team rescued their team-mates. In Ireland, she took the strength-enhancing Berserker Staff in combat against the members of a Norse Paganist hate group. She was able to control the rage-inducing properties of the staff and claimed it was because she lived with her rage every day. That night she slept with Grant Ward.

Hunting a Ghost
May starts a relationship with Grant Ward
When the team was called in to perform an Index Asset Evaluation and Intake report on Hannah Hutchins, she was instrumental in talking down Hutchins' tormentor, Tobias Ford.

Hunt for Centipede
May is knocked down by a Centipede Soldier
When Phil Coulson decided to focus all of the team's efforts on bringing down the Centipede Project, he brought Mike Peterson, now in training to become a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent to assist in their fight against the enhanced Centipede Soldiers. She assisted Peterson, Coulson, and Ward in infiltrating the Centipede base in Oakland. Discovering Peterson was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, Raina and Edison Po kidnapped Ace Peterson using him to convince his father to bring Coulson to a hostage exchange.

May fighting against a Centipede Soldier
When Centipede took Coulson, she called in backup, but the backup failed to arrive before Coulson was taken and Peterson was apparently killed. May knew Skye could assist better finding Coulson when she wouldn't be on the Bus, so she advised to Victoria Hand to let Skye be free during the investigation. Skye found Coulson's location, and his team went to rescue him. After they fought the Centipede Soldiers they saved Coulson and brought him back to the Bus.

Skye's Story
May and Phil Coulson in Mexico City
In order to learn about Skye's history May and Phil Coulson traveled to Mexico City, Mexico, where they tracked down former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Richard Lumley, who had been involved with Skye's case and fell off the grid soon after.

Lumley told them the story of that long-ago op. Soon after returning home, the other agents involved in the op began to be eliminated until only he and Linda Avery remained. Avery took steps to hide Skye in the foster care system, making sure she would never be in one place for too long, before being murdered herself. May, shocked from the story, urged Coulson not to tell it to Skye.

Tracking Cybertek
To be added

Agent Down
Phil Coulson decided to bring Skye to the Guest House, where he had been resurrected, to treat the near-fatal injury that she received from Ian Quinn. Despite their differences, May was genuinely concerned about Skye's well-being, and losing control of herself, May attacked Quinn just to make him suffer. With the help of John Garrett and Antoine Triplett, they retrieved the GH.325 to save Skye's life. The formula worked, and Skye stabilized.

Working with Lady Sif
The team suddenly faced the arrival of a new visitant on Earth: Lady Sif whom was looking for Lorelei an Asgardian that escaped during the Sacking of Asgard. S.H.I.E.L.D. helped the warrior in the search for Lorelei. However, Lorelei used her powers to sway Grant Ward under her control. After a few days, May and the team confronted Lorelei and Ward. The relationship between they both was ended when Lorelei revealed that Ward was not honest with her. Sif captured Lorelei and returned to Asgard.

Secrets Revealed
May calls Nick Fury
May managed to overhear a conversation between Phil Coulson and Skye, and she used a secure phone to contact Nick Fury and told him that "Coulson knows" about the source of the GH.325.

May searches for Leo Fitz
Fitz discovered the phone line at a time when tensions were already high: The team was searching for the Clairvoyant; Felix Blake was critically injured by Deathlok; Jemma Simmons was transferred to the Hub to be a consultant; and Grant Ward had killed Thomas Nash. He told Skye, who told Coulson, while he was interrogating Ward to see if he worked for the Clairvoyant. May hunted for Fitz to shoot him with an I.C.E.R. when Coulson and Skye surrounded her at gunpoint demanding answers. Suddenly the plane was rerouted to the Hub by Victoria Hand.

May is threatened by Phil Coulson
During her interrogation, May explained that the line went to Nick Fury, who wanted constant updates on Coulson's progress after his resurrection. Coulson used the I.C.E.R. on her. Meantime The team found out that there were secret HYDRA agents inside S.H.I.E.L.D. all along. After they landed and May woke up, she called Fury, only to hear a voice telling her he was dead. With John Garrett, the team planned to attack Hand, who they suspected was the real Clairvoyant. However, Garret accidentally revealed himself to be the Clairvoyant and a member of HYDRA. After a brief fight, Garret was arrested. Coulson ultimately decided that for her secrets, she was an ally, no longer his friend, in their new battle against HYDRA.

Leaving the Team
May leaves Coulson's Team
After the team arrived to the Providence, May left her team and arranged to have her mother Lian pick her up in Canada, 500 miles from her mother's home. Her mother gave May contact information for Maria Hill, with whom she wanted to talk.

May digs up Phil Coulson's grave
May found Hill under surveillance by various agencies after the downfall of S.H.I.E.L.D. After subduing Hill's tails, the two talked. May did not believe Hill's statement that Nick Fury was dead. She did obtain a clue concerning the leader of Project T.A.H.I.T.I. and dug up Phil Coulson's gravesite to find the answer. Hill told her that Grant Ward was an HYDRA member. May found the team in Los Angeles in a hotel, where Coulson forgave her for her secrets, and she revealed to him a report that Coulson himself had made to Fury where he resigned as leader of Project T.A.H.I.T.I., asking Fury not to use it.

A Woman Scorned
May and Phil Coulson undercover at Cybertek
The next morning, Coulson's Team had a meeting on how to find John Garrett and retrieve the Bus. After the meeting, May and Skye talked candidly about Grant Ward and how to focus their emotional pain effectively. May offered to be Skye's new S.O. May and Coulson went undercover as unemployed S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists seeking work with Cybertek in Palo Alto to get files pertaining to Deathlok. Eventually, Coulson's team learned of the old S.H.I.E.L.D. base that became the Barbershop Headquarters of HYDRA in Havana, Cuba. When they arrived however, May and the others became surrounded by Centipede Soldiers and Kaminsky carrying the Berserker Staff.

May prepares to attack HYDRA
May quickly relieved Kaminsky of the Berserker Staff as the others fought and Skye uploaded a computer program that allowed her to find Garrett. When Coulson ordered her to "bring the house down," May destroyed the support beams of the headquarters, causing the building to collapse and burying her opponents.

May shoots nails into Grant Ward's foot
The team went to the Cybertek Manufacturing Facility in New Mexico and May and Skye entered through an opening created by Coulson and Antoine Triplett. Inside, May battled Grant Ward, enraged about his betrayal. The fight spilled over into the neighboring construction site, where she used a nail gun on Ward's foot and broke his larynx, winning the fight.

Meeting with Nick Fury
May arrives at the Playground
After the defeat of Garrett, she, Coulson, and Nick Fury had a meeting, discussing Project T.A.H.I.T.I., S.H.I.E.L.D.'s founding principles, and Fury's status. She witnessed Coulson become the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and went with the team to meet Billy Koenig in the Playground.

The New Beginning
May meeting with Phil Coulson
A few months after Coulson officially became director, Coulson tasked Melinda May, Antoine Triplett, and Skye to act as back-up for Isabelle Hartley, Idaho, and Lance Hunter, who were attempting to buy information from a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent when they were attacked by Carl Creel, who stole the information on an 0-8-4 that they sought. When May returned to the Playground and had a meeting with Coulson, she reminded him that she was to watch over him and keep him out of field missions, but he was making her job difficult by constantly being away.

May fights against the Absorbing Man
May then fought Creel when he attacked Glenn Talbot and assisted in Talbot's kidnapping. May told Skye to stay with her as they, Triplett, and the others went into a Government Storage Warehouse that had the Obelisk. When the operation went badly due to Creel's interference, May led Skye and Triplett to fulfill the second half of the mission: to obtain a Quinjet, so that the new S.H.I.E.L.D. could travel undetected. As Triplett and Skye escaped in the cloaked vehicle, May took a motorcycle for her escape. 

May chases Carl Creel
May saw the crashed SUV Lance Hunter was in and helped him escape it before pursuing Creel on the motorcycle. When she could have shot him from behind, Coulson told her to stand down because she was among civilian traffic. May yielded and followed Creel to a restaurant where he accidentally killed a waitress who had touched him before he escaped.

May is shot by Lance Hunter
May returned to the Playground where she and the other field agents met with Phil Coulson and witnessed his conversation with Raina to learn that the Obelisk could be tracked. However, she was knocked unconscious by an I.C.E.R. fired by Lance Hunter. Later, May confronted Coulson about going into the field to stop Creel and why, after eighteen days, he had not released his urge to write the Words of Creation. Upon her prompting, Coulson yielded and began to carve the symbols on a wall in his office. Meanwhile, May documented the incident.

The Moroccan Mission
May trains Skye
May continued her training of Skye in firearms, but advised her that killing is not an easy task. They were then interrupted by Hunter and Mack, the former asking if Skye attended the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy to settle their wager; May reminded Hunter that she had not, otherwise he would  have known better than to shoot them. Hunter tried to apologize again but May refused to take it, telling him to wait.

May searches for Donnie Gill
She accompanied Skye and Hunter to Morocco in pursuit of Blizzard. While there, she and Hunter were told that HYDRA had brainwashed Gill, so no HYDRA agent should contact him. As Hunter was aiming to shoot the agent talking to Gill, May recognized the agent as Jemma Simmons, Coulson's mole in HYDRA. She shot Hunter with an I.C.E.R. to save Simmons, but this alerted Gill to their presence. May and Hunter were then trapped in the freighter when Blizzard froze the door. When they returned to the Playground, May admitted to Skye that she had known Simmons was Coulson's mole. She also told Hunter that she and he were now even for when he shot her with an I.C.E.R.; however, she was only speaking for herself.

Double Trouble
May dances with Phil Coulson
Posing as Heidi Martin, May accompanied Coulson to a fundraiser for Santa Maria de las Flores in Miami, Florida to obtain a 500 year old painting with the Words of Creation inscribed on its back. Following Glenn Talbot, who was truly a disguised Sunil Bakshi, to his hotel room, May discovered the brainwashed Agent 33 working for HYDRA. As they fought, May was distracted by Bakshi and rendered unconscious. Agent 33 then used the Photostatic Veil to copy May's face.

May vs "May"
When May awakened, she was tied to a chair with Bakshi threatening to torture her for S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secrets. The commotion of Coulson's and Agent 33's struggle outside the room distracted Bakshi enough for May to escape. Then she challenged Agent 33 who continued to wear May's face. After a prolonged fight, May electrocuted the HYDRA operative and exited before backup soldiers could arrive. After calling the real Glenn Talbot to inform him of HYDRA's latest scheme, May and Coulson talked about May's plan if Coulson went insane from the effects of GH.325. Though she told him that she would care for him, Coulson ordered her to put him down instead. May just nodded her head.

Revelations
May listens to Phil Coulson
When S.H.I.E.L.D. learned of a massacre in which the U.S. Navy's anti-HYDRA task force was affected by a weapon resembling the effects of the Obelisk, May assumed it to be in HYDRA's possession. As she, Skye, Antoine Triplett and Lance Hunter went to Phil Coulson for information, Skye spotted Coulson scribbling the alien writing into his desk. When asked for his source on the writing, Coulson remained tight-lipped. As everyone else left, May advised Coulson that keeping Skye in the dark would not end well. May later barged into Coulson's office in the middle of his argument with Skye, who had discovered Coulson's condition, announcing that Raina was calling them again and wanted to meet.

May confronts Skye
Coulson agreed to meet and brought May, Skye and Hunter along as his lookouts. While Hunter sat on restaurant floor, May and Skye watched through the kitchen window. After Raina entered the restaurant, she and Coulson had a debate about the Obelisk before Coulson questioned what she had up her sleeve. Raina then revealed that she discovered Jemma Simmons working undercover at HYDRA and threatened to expose her if Coulson does not allow her take Skye.

When questioned why, she revealed that she knows Skye's Father. Though May insisted that she was lying, Skye said that Grant Ward said Raina knew her father and it could not be a coincidence. Coulson then refused the bargain, prompting Skye to attempt to go out and surrender herself; May blocked her, ordering her to stand down. Though Skye insisted that Simmons' life was on the line, May claimed that Coulson had a plan and was forced to restrain her. Coulson allowed the situation with Raina to play it out, showing that he had a plan and was not going to be threatened by Raina.

With her leverage gone, Raina was forced to confess that she was trying to reclaim the Obelisk from Skye's father to spare herself from Daniel Whitehall's wrath. After injecting a tracker into Raina's leg and getting Skye's father's location, Coulson sent her off. May then took note that the address Raina gave was only a few blocks away. She then signaled Coulson to switch off their earpieces to privately discuss what Richard Lumley told them about Skye, suggesting that her father was the one whom the ex-agent feared. They then noticed that Skye had gone ahead and managed to catch up with her. They found the condemned building deserted, save for two corpses, one killed by a scalpel and the other by brute force. This causes Skye to label her father a monster.

Back at the Playground, while enjoying Simmons' return, May informed a confused Triplett that Bobbi Morse was Hunter's "she-devil ex-wife" he always complained about.

Mission Commander
Attack on the United Nations
Melinda May led Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter to Okinawa, Japan when they discovered that the Splinter Bombs used in an attack by HYDRA hired mercenaries on the United Nations were created there. During the flight, Morse asked May whether she still spoke to her ex-husband; May did not say a word.

May fights Marcus Scarlotti
May's team though arrived too late to save Noelle Walters' team from being killed by those same mercenaries. Their leader, Marcus Scarlotti, killed Walters personally. When the team did arrive, May fought Scarlotti unarmed as he used his personal weapon, the Rope Dart Knife. She eventually knocked him unconscious for Glenn Talbot to take him into custody as Talbot gave his condolences to May on losing six agents.

The Hunt for Grant Ward
May with Antoine Triplett in a Quinjet
May was field commander of the mission to capture Grant Ward after he escaped federal custody. She told Skye that if Coulson began carving the symbols while she was away to monitor him. While she was flying the Quinjet, Antoine Triplett and Bobbi Morse both answered to her when he failed to capture Ward in Philadelphia and her cover was blown in Atlanta.

May had to stay focused on her assignment when she learned that Phil Coulson was using the Theta Brain-Wave Frequency Machine.

May in Boston
In Boston, May gathered her field agents, including Lance Hunter, to raid the Goldbrix Tavern to capture Ward. There she found three dead HYDRA agents and Sunil Bakshi in a back room, tied to a chair and unconscious. Returning to the Playground with Bakshi, May witnessed Coulson ask Hank Thompson to join the organization. She then assembled with the other senior agents when Coulson gave them a new mission: find the city that matched the Words of Creation before HYDRA can.

Interrogation of Sunil Bakshi
May in the new S.H.I.E.L.D. base
May was in charge of the Playground while Coulson, Antoine Triplett, and Skye went to find the city. She told Coulson that Christian Ward wanted his own people to find his brother because S.H.I.E.L.D. was politically toxic.

Attention was given to Sunil Bakshi and Bobbi Morse's interrogation of him in Vault D. During the session, Morse wondered how Daniel Whitehall was connected to the Red Skull, so May revealed the keys to Vault B, where the Strategic Scientific Reserve kept its files. During their research, the agents learned that Whitehall was around during World War II as Werner Reinhardt, but they could not discern how he kept his youth.

Detaining Raina
May aims her gun at Grant Ward
When the Bus returned from Australia after finding the location of the city that matched the Words of Creation, May was among the assembled agents that Phil Coulson prepped to enter the city. However, Coulson learned from Billy Koenig that Agent 33 was assigned by HYDRA to retrieve Raina in Vancouver. So May became the mission commander of a team to protect her. Sam Koenig was looking forward to see her.

News aired of the investigation into the death of Senator Christian Ward; May told Skye that S.H.I.E.L.D. did all it could to help him. Coulson put Skye on May's team so that May could supervise her.

In Canada, May shot two HYDRA agents in a van, then used that van to hit two more operatives as they approached Raina when she attempted to surrender.

Aboard the cloaked Bus, everyone was wondering how May felt about Agent 33 having May's face. Skye came to her in a panic, talking that Coulson needed to be warned before he entered the city, but communications went down as four HYDRA Quinjets surrounded the plane.

Grant Ward traced Raina through the signal emitted by her tracker. May led the agents, guns drawn, in surrounding Ward as he entered the Bus. Ward promised that the quinjets would not fire, killing everyone, if Raina and Skye came willingly. Skye convinced May to allow her to leave.

Battle for the Kree City
May managed to save the rest of agents from an attack by the HYDRA Quinjets with a smart maneuver to cloak the Bus and eject the pods inside the plane to make HYDRA pilots believe they managed to destroy them. Arriving at San Juan, May told Phil Coulson what happened. In the Bus May blamed herself for letting Ward take Skye, but Coulson told her that her actions saved the others and that Skye would be fine as she had trained her into a fully capable field agent.

May during the earthquake
When Coulson learned that HYDRA was in the Ponce de León Theater, May, Morse, Hunter, and Coulson prepared for the Battle for the Kree City. May landed the S.H.I.E.L.D. Quinjet upon the roof, and she and the agents went down firing as HYDRA operatives came up. When she reached the Plasma Drill at the bottom, she attempted to stop Coulson from going into the Kree City, but Coulson was determined to save Skye and to see what all of the writing meant. When Morse and Hunter came, May told them to flee before the bombs that Antoine Triplett set could explode. She was over the hole as an earthquake shook the area.

Tricking Sunil Bakshi
Upon return from Kree City, the senior agents were stressed; May used exercise to mentally handle the death of Antoine Triplett.

Phil Coulson called a meeting of the senior agents to discuss what he wanted done with Sunil Bakshi and how he planned to make HYDRA pay for Triplett's death. During the meeting, Alphonso Mackenzie and Coulson began to argue; May told Mackenzie to remember his rank when speaking to Coulson. This statement was not liked by Lance Hunter who began arguing with May. Ultimately, Coulson pulled rank and dismissed the squabble.

May shoots "HYDRA Agents"
May and Coulson began transferring Bakshi to Glenn Talbot's custody when the S.H.I.E.L.D. SUV she was driving was hit by a truck filled with mercenaries. After a firefight where May proved her marksmanship and acrobatic superiority, she was shot by a mercenary who escaped with Bakshi. However, all of this was planned to lead S.H.I.E.L.D. to HYDRA's new superior since Daniel Whitehall was dead.

May returned to the Playground and visited Skye in her quarantine. She saw Skye bleeding and asked what happened; before she could answer, Leo Fitz assured May that everything was fine. May went to call Coulson, who was visiting Mrs. Triplett.

May attended the vigil the senior agents had for Triplett.

Protecting Skye
May training with Skye
May and Skye sparred together, but May sensed that her student was holding back. When Leo Fitz interrupted the session, May challenged him but Skye asked him to leave, saying that she was fine.
