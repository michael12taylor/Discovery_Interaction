Early Life
Raised by Romeo
Zip was born to Romeo, a member from the Rivals and a highly respected member within the Harlem crime scene. Zip would eventually follow in his father's footsteps, by joining the Stokes Crime Family, and going under the employment of Cottonmouth. During this time, Zip would work as a thug for Cottonmouth, although he had ambition to grow further in the organisation.

Cottonmouth's Thug
Protection for Mariah Dillard
Zip and Sugar closely follow Mariah Dillard
Zip and Sugar were tasked to act as the bodyguards during an event which had been hosted by Mariah Dillard, where Dillard had visited a park to raise the support for their New Harlem Renaissance. In order to appear more like legitimate supporters, Zip and Sugar would hand out flyers for the event and collected contributions, to help them blend in and not intimidate the other guests. While Dillard spoke to the media and greeted her guests, Zip and Sugar had continued to remain close by, much to the continued frustration of Dillard, with Dillard becoming frustrated that they were making her own supporters uncomfortable.

Zip and Sugar keep remaining stood guard
Zip stayed by as Dillard conducted an interview with Megan McLaren of WJBP-TV, discussing the work of her political campaigns, and the Crispus Attucks Complex, until Dillard told Zip and Sugar to step off. They were then joined by Cottonmouth, who had been watching Dillard's interview alongside Shades and Tone, as Cottonmouth told Zip and Sugar to give Dillard some more space. While they remained nearby, Dillard complained to Cottonmouth about him sending in thugs to follow her, to which Cottonmouth had argued that Zip and Sugar were required for her protection at these events.

Robbery of Genghis Connie's
Zip and his crew approaching Luke Cage
That evening, Zip and other members of the Stokes Crime Family, had been stood outside of Genghis Connie's to pass out flyers. When Luke Cage walked by Zip asked him what time it was, which Cage answered, only for Sugar and Amos to laugh at him. In response, Zip had then handed Cage a flyer for Mariah Dillard's New Harlem Renaissance, as he then told Cage to stay Harlem and stay black, only for Cage to remain confuse and walk away from Zip and the others.

Zip demanding Jin and Connie Lin pay them
Once the restaurant had been closed, Zip and his crew returned to threaten Jin and Connie Lin, demanding that they give their money to Dillard's political campaign, and smashing their property with a baseball bat when they had refused, with the crew mocking them for their ability to speak English. However, despite Zip's threats, the Lin's had insisted that they would not contribute to the Crispus Attucks Complex, noting that they had previously contributed to her, and that they had respect for Cottonmouth, but that they would still not be willing to support Dillard's campaigns ever again.

Zip getting challenged by Luke Cage
In response, Zip slammed his bat on the ground and once again demanded that they give him their money. However, Zip was then interrupted by the arrival of Cage, who told Zip that he disliked his tone, as he was being disrespectful to the Lin's. Unimpressed by Cage, Zip and the others began to laugh, as Koko told him to walk away, with Sugar mocking the idea that Cage could challenge all of them. However, Cage told the crew that he would be able to take them down, noting that if he really put effort into the fight, he would likely kill all of them, with Zip continuing to mock all of these threats.

Zip is thrown against a wall by Luke Cage
Zip then told Amos to show Cage the punch that he was famous for, believing that Amos would be able to knock Cage unconscious with minimal effort. However, much to their shock, Amos' punch did nothing to effect Cage, and actually just resulted in Amos' arm being broken, before Cage picked him up and threw him through the window. Zip had then charged at Cage and swung his bat at him, only for Cage to shatter it with his arm, before he then launched Zip against the wall. With Zip unconscious, Cage also blocked Koko's gunshot, before knocking him unconscious, while Sugar politely walked away.

Declaration of War
Zip and Cottonmouth greet Domingo Colon
While Zip had been in Harlem's Paradise with Cottonmouth, he had witnessed the surprise arrival of Domingo Colon with his crew, who commented on the beauty of their club, while Zip stepped between Cottonmouth and Colon, while keeping a hand on his gun. However, Cottonmouth told Zip to stand down, noting that Colon was right to appreciate their club, while also making a comment that he could see Colon for who he really was, suggesting that it had actually been Colon who had been the one who arranged all of those recent raids of his facilities.

Zip attempting to threaten Domingo Colon
Zip had remained close by, as Colon insisted that if it had been the Colon Crime Family that had attacked the Stokes Crime Family, then Cottonmouth and everyone associated with him, would already be dead. As Colon then reached into his pocket, Zip once again threatened to draw his gun, only for Colon to pull out a candy bar, which he then proceeded to unwrap and disrespectfully drop the wrapping on the floor, which Cottonmouth laughed at. Zip had then stood by as Colon continued to disrespect both the club and Cottonmouth himself, while still denying having anything to do with the recent raids.

Zip asking for his orders from Cottonmouth
Zip witnessed Colon question how Diamondback had felt about the situation they were now in, before demanding to either get a refund on his money, or to be supplied with the Hammer Industries guns that he had been promised. With Cottonmouth refusing Colon's demands, Colon then said something in Spanish to him, which Zip did not understand, before walking out of the club, leaving his litter on the ground. Once Colon and his crew had departed, Zip had then approached Cottonmouth and questioned what had happened, to which Cottonmouth told him to learn more Spanish, as Colon  just declared war on them.

Disposing of Chico Diaz
Zip greets Cottonmouth and Mariah Dillard
However, Zip later learnt that Crispus Attucks Complex had also been raided, resulting in their stockpiles of cash becoming seized by the New York City Police Department. This news caused Cottonmouth to fly into a rage over the amount of money he had lost, as he and Mariah Dillard furiously argued about the situation and how to fix it. Zip was then met by Rafael Scarfe, who had come to Harlem's Paradise to speak with Cottonmouth, as Zip nervously informed Cottonmouth of this.

Zip being given Rafael Scarfe's car keys
Zip had then followed Cottonmouth downstairs and stood close by, as Cottonmouth had demanded an update about the situation, as Scarfe threw Zip his car keys, and informed him that the corpse of Chico Diaz could be found inside of his trunk, who he had just murdered for Cottonmouth. As Scarfe noted that they could use Spurlock's Mortuary to dispose of Diaz's body, Cottonmouth then indicated for Zip to go to Scarfe's car and collect Diaz's body. In the meantime, Scarfe had also informed Cottonmouth that Luke Cage had been the one who was responsible for all of the recent raids against their facilities.

State of the Union
Zip attends a Stokes Crime Family meeting
Zip had joined the rest of his crew at Harlem's Paradise to discuss the current status of the Stokes Crime Family, as Darrell Mitchell informed the crew that, following all of the recent raids on their facilities, to which Mitchell had informed them that Cottonmouth was officially broke. Zip listened as Mitchell broke down Cottonmouth's financial situation in more detail, noting what assets he had remaining, and what he could use to get himself out of his current situation.

Zip listens to Koko's ideas about Luke Cage
Zip listened as Mitchell noted how Luke Cage had affecting the talk about Cottonmouth on the streets, before they were interrupted as Koko made a point about the history of race and social politics in America, summing up his point by suggesting that they leave Cage alone, and control their half of Harlem. In response to this, Cottonmouth then drew his gun and shot Koko in the head, much to the horror of Zip and the others. Cottonmouth then turned to Zip and ordered him to harass the people of Harlem for protection money, telling him to bring everything back to Harlem's Paradise by the evening.

Zip getting his orders from Cottonmouth
Although Cottonmouth was advised by Shades that this plan would not work, as this situation was exactly why Diamondback had sent him to overlook Cottonmouth's criminal empire. Cottonmouth then addressed Zip and the others, telling them to go out in the streets and begin taking people's money, while advising them to blame the situation on Cage, and tell the people to head to Pop's Barber Shop to confront Cage directly about this. As Cottonmouth had then dismissed the crew, he ordered Zip to call Joel Spurlock, and to inform him that they would soon to be in need of his services.

Zip and Sugar stealing from Aisha Axton
As Zip and his crew people hunting down the money from the people of Harlem, he first got into the driver's seat of a wealthy man's car, surprising him as he went to leave, and forcing him to hand over his money, telling him to blame Cage for the new taxes. Zip then went to Aisha Axton's store, demanding that she pay up, with Axton insisting that she did not have the money to pay him this month, before grabbing a baseball bat to desperately attempting to defend herself, only for Zip to disarm her and begin smashing up the store. As Sugar held Axton back, she watched in horror as Zip smashed her shelves.

Zip steals Eddie Axton's championship ring
Zip had then come across Eddie Axton's championship ring, as he questioned if he had played for the New York Mets, while Sugar noted that he had been cut, and had then played for the New York Nine instead. Despite the pleads from Axton for him to stop, Zip had then proceeded to smash the glass and take the championship ring for himself, as he looked down at Axton, mocking her for being scared and crying on the floor. Zip had then told Axton that, if she was angry about the current situation, that it was Cage she should be confronting, before he and Sugar then walked out of the store.

Luke Cage's Treat
Zip getting confronted by Luke Cage again
Following his day of exploiting the people of Harlem, Zip had then joined several others at Jackie Robinson Park to gamble with the money. However, as Zip collected his winnings, he was interrupted by the arrival of Luke Cage, who had mockingly noted his surpris that the Stokes Crime Family took lunch breaks. Zip then stood by as Cage questioned who had witnessed his strength at Crispus Attucks Complex, resulting in everyone but Zip walking away, fearful of Cage's strength.

Zip trying and failing to shoot at Luke Cage
Annoyed, Zip claimed that he did not need the others and drew his gun, expecting it to be enough for Cage to back off. Much to Zip's surprise, however, Cage continued to walk towards him, causing Zip to shoot him in the chest, which had seemingly no effect on Cage, as he continued walking towards him. The shocked Zip shot Cage once more in the chest, but Cage continued to be unaffected, as he instead took the gun out of Zip's hand and bent it in front of him, as Zip stood amazed. Cage then grabbed Zip by the throat, demanding that Aisha Axton's championship ring be returned, although Zip denied any knowledge.

Zip being lifted up into the air by Luke Cage
Cage had then told Zip to consider where they were, while calling it hallowed ground that was named after Jackie Robinson, as he then proceeded to lift Zip into the air with one arm, causing Zip to become shocked and horrified by Cage's true strength. Cage then continued to tell Zip that the legacy of their people was all around them, if Zip would just look around at it. Still holding him high in the air, Cage had reached into Zip's pocket and took Eddie Axton's championship ring back, intending to return it to Aisha. Having gotten what he came for, Cage then realised Zip, leaving him to try and catch his breath back, and consider what he had learnt about Cage's true power.

Chase of Rafael Scarfe
Zip asking Cottonmouth to promote him
As word got out that Rafael Scarfe had gone missing, having been shot by Cottonmouth and was at risk of exposing his entire operation, Zip had returned to Harlem's Paradise to get his orders. Stepping into his office, Zip found Cottonmouth as he furiously threw his phone at the wall, having had no updates on Scarfe's whereabouts. Zip questioned where Shades was, with Cottonmouth noted that he did not know, as Zip suggested that he be allowed to take over from Shades.

Zip being ordered to locate Rafael Scarfe
Although Cottonmouth was reluctant to promote him, Zip had simply noted that he did not have many options left. Reluctantly, Cottonmouth told Zip to get the word out on the streets of Harlem, that he would be offering a hundred thousand dollars to whoever killed Scarfe, noting that Scarfe had last been seen being placed into a green van with Luke Cage, having left Pop's Barber Shop. Although Zip put the word out, and Scarfe was found and chased down, resulting in Scarfe's death, Cottonmouth was still arrested by the New York City Police Department, following the statements Scarfe had made.

Gun Deal Interrupted
Zip attempting to sell guns on the streets
Despite the situation with the Stokes Crime Family, Zip had continued with his criminal activities, as he step up a gun deal, where he excitedly presented his potential buyers with the weapons, which had included two desert eagles that he promised would be effective in scaring away any potential threats. However, Zip's presentation was interrupted by the arrival of Luke Cage, who simply removed his hood, revealing his identity, which was enough to cause all of Zip's potential customers to run.

Zip making his veiled threats to Luke Cage
Annoyed and knowing he stood no chance against Cage in a physical fight, Zip simply surrendered the weapons to him, as Cage commented that Zip should be looking for a new profession. As Zip watched Cage bending the guns with his bare hands, Cage commented that Cottonmouth was done, only for Zip to note that clearly Cage had not heard that Cottonmouth was being released from the New York City Police Department's custody, as Rafael Scarfe's statements had not been enough. With that, Zip had then made gun fingers and shouted boom, indicating that Cage had failed his mission, but Zip made his escape.

New Employers
Shades' New Position
Zip, Sugar and Amos greeting Shades
Following the death of Cottonmouth, Zip and his crew returned back to Harlem's Paradise, where they found Shades exploring the club. As Shades questioned what they wanted, Zip noted that they were there to learn what was next following Cottonmouth's death, to which Shades commented on the poor job they had done with protecting Cottonmouth, although Sugar argued that Cottonmouth had pushed them away. Zip then insisted that, with their boss dead, they needed to be paid for the loss of work.

Zip being recruited to work for Shades
However, Shades then stepped up to Zip and informed him and his crew that they worked for him now, commenting that the club now belonged to Mariah Dillard, but he would be in charge of the Stokes Crime Family from now on. Zip had then accepted this change in leadership, before Shades handed him a wad of cash, telling Zip and the others to go out and buy themselves some new clothes, insisting that they would be moving into a higher class with him leading them. Zip questioned if Shades was worried about Luke Cage, although Shades did not answer this question and had instead told Zip to leave.

Recruited by Diamondback
Zip updating Shades on Luke Cage's status
Having accepting his new boss, Zip returned to Harlem's Paradise with his new suit, as Shades watched the band rehearsing. Shades then commented that Zip and his crew had so far failed to locate the body of Luke Cage, after he had been shot by two Judas Bullets, although Zip insisted that they would find him. However, they were then interrupted by the arrival of Diamondback, who mocked their failed efforts to find Cage, questioning if he had dissipated like smoke.

Zip and Shades warned by Diamondback
Zip had then witnessed Diamondback placing his hand into his jacket, and pulling out finger guns, which he mockingly aimed at Zip and Sugar, before shooting Darnell in the shoulder, with the gun he was holding in his other hand. As Zip and the others reacted with shock, Diamondback insisting there was nothing about this trick, or how Cage disappeared, claiming that where there was smoke, there was also fire. With that, Diamondback demanded that Zip and his crew leave to follow the fire and find Cage, recommending they find the garbage truck that Cage fell into when he had been shot for the second time.

Zip stopping Diamondback killing Shades
Once Zip had returned into the office, he found Diamondback aiming his gun at Shades' head, questioning why he should not shoot him, only for Zip to suggest that he would not find Cage any faster if he killed Shades. This comment caused Diamondback to begin to laugh, as he lowered his gun and told Zip that he was smarter than his name implied. Zip had then listened as Diamondback explained that the two books that helped him survive were the bible and The Forty Eight Laws of Power, telling them that the final rule would be that Cage was not dead until Zip's crew had found his body.

Zip and Darnell protecting Diamondback
While the search for Cage had continued, Zip and his crew would also return to the club, to stand guard of Diamondback, as he watched The Delfonics performing. During the performance, Zip was approached by Shades, who whispered in his ear, as Zip gave Shades permission to speak with Diamondback, informing him that the footage of Cage fighting against two officers from the New York City Police Department had gone viral. Zip stood by with Sugar and Darnell, as Diamondback had simply suggested that they do nothing more about it, and decided that he instead wanted to listen to the Delfonics' performance.

Attack on Harlem's Paradise
Zip shoots at Luke Cage and Misty Knight
During a fundraiser that was being hosted by Mariah Dillard inside of Harlem's Paradise, a shootout broke out between Diamondback and Luke Cage, resulting in most of the attendees escaping, while Zip and the rest of his crew shooting at Cage, who was attempting to protect Misty Knight behind the bar. As Zip continued to shoot at Cage, he complained that Cage was bulletproof, only for Diamondback to not that Knight was not, and they should shot at her instead.

Zip attempting to chase down Luke Cage
Eventually, Cage got to his feet and fled towards the kitchen, as Zip and the others shot at him, with Cage blocking the bullets with his back and shielding the injured Knight. As Zip ran to the kitchen, he shot at the door and attempted to get inside, only to realise that Cage had blocked the doorway. Zip returned to Diamondback and informed him of the situation, only for Shades to advise that they forget about Cage and leave, as the New York City Police Department would be on their way. However, Diamondback ignored Shades' advice, ordering Zip to ensure that nobody else got in or out of the club.

Zip gets his orders from Diamondback
Zip listened as Shades continued to doubt Diamondback's plan, noting that they only had one Judas Bullet left to use against Cage, while Sugar informed them that the club had been locked down, leaving them with no way out. Diamondback then ordered the crew to take anybody who was not one of them as a hostage, telling Sugar and Lopes to watch over them, and shoot anybody who argued with their planning. Zip then stood by as his crew took the fundraiser guests as hostages, with Ty taking Damon Boone to Diamondback's office, as Diamondback ordered Zip to collect a certain key that he required.

Zip watches Diamondback shoot a door
As instructed, Zip had then collected a Hammer Industries Grenade Launcher from the office and gave it to Diamondback. While Shades continued to express his nerves about Diamondback's actions, Zip watched on with excitement, as Diamondback called it the moment when the panties dropped, before shooting a grenade at the kitchen door, destroying it and blowing back the fridge that Cage blocked it with. Zip had then followed Shades inside the burning kitchen, but failed to find Cage and Knight, as Zip insisted they did not escape, as Diamondback ordered the crew search every inch of the kitchen.

Zip complaining about things to Sugar
With Zip and his crew still unable to locate Cage and Knight, despite searching the entire kitchen and all nearby rooms, Zip had then walked over to Sugar, complaining about them being forced to guard the hostages that they had taken under Diamondback's orders. Sugar had then questioned if Zip had been able to find Cage yet, to which Zip compared Cage to Harry Houdini, while Sugar continued to question if Cage would have been able to get downstairs, which Zip denied, insisting there was no way downstairs from the kitchen, before he walked away, leaving Sugar guarding the hostages.

Escaping with Diamondback
Zip helping Diamondback to escape there
As the situation in Harlem's Paradise began to get out of hand, the New York City Police Department had charged inside, as they managed to surround Luke Cage and take him into custody, under the threat of gunning him down with Judas Bullets. While Cage was being taken into custody, Zip had then managed to get to a secret doorway and went to the office of Diamondback, who initially held a gun to Zip, until he was told that this was the way for them to make their escape.

Zip and Diamondback making their escape
As they made their way through these secret tunnels under the club, Diamondback had questioned if Zip had a ride for them, to which Zip noted that Cottonmouth had three which they could use. Stepping out of the back door, Zip ensured that the police were not looking in their direction, as they were taking Shades and the other members of the Stokes Crime Family into custody, alongside Cage. Diamondback then hide his gun in his jacket, before he and Zip then disappeared into the crowds that had gathered around the club and made their escape by getting into Cottonmouth's old car and driving away.

Reunion with Turk Barrett
Zip giving Diamondback another update
Having gone off the grid to avoid the New York City Police Department, Zip was sent by Diamondback to go to his home and collect some files that he needed, only for Zip to find that they were missing. Zip had then gone to meet with Diamondback in their Warehouse Hideout to tell him the bad news, where Diamondback was currently having a meeting with Turk Barrett, whom he had wanted to assist him with gaining new contacts to buy his Hammer Industries guns.

Zip being strangled by Diamondback
Interrupting, Zip told Diamondback that he had some bad news, only for Diamondback to demand that Zip remove the sunglasses he was wearing to emulate Shades, which Zip did. Zip explained that he had gone to Diamondback's home, and the files that he had wanted had disappeared. In response, Diamondback grabbed Zip by the throat and began strangling him, much to the horror of Barrett and the others in the room, until Diamondback began to laugh and finally released Zip. As Zip gasped for air, Diamondback mocked him for actually believing that he would kill him, telling Zip that he liked him for his ambition.

Zip gets nervous around Diamondback
Diamondback told Zip that his ambition would take him far, as long as he was willing to stay in his place, noting that the first rule of the The Forty Eight Laws of Power was to never outshine the master. As Zip nervously listened, Diamondback went on to explain that this was the mistake that Shades had made, by questioning his decisions and doubting his leadership, comparing Shades to Icarus, and questioning if Zip knew who Icarus was. However, Zip mistook Icarus for a rapper who performed with Kendrick Lamar, only for Barrett to correct him that Icarus was a character from Greek mythology.

Zip questioning Diamondback's plans
Zip then noted that Shades was not a problem, as he was still in custody at the 29th Precinct Police Station, only for Diamondback to note that this was not for long. Although Zip questioned if Diamondback intended to blow up the station, he was told that Shades was actually going to be bailed out, as Zip questioned the reasons behind this, insisting that freeing Shades made no sense. Diamondback then interrupted Zip, noting to Barrett that he was already questioning his leadership, suggesting that Zip was heading in the same direction as Shades, before Diamondback suggested that Shades would soon be gone.

Zip loyalties are questioned by Turk Barrett
Zip was told by Diamondback that there would soon be an opening for Shades' position within his organisation, questioning if Zip would be ready to step up, to which Zip insisted that he was down for what Diamondback needed. With Barrett on board, Diamondback ordered Zip to escort him out. As they walked out together, Barrett told Zip that his father, Romeo, would be disgusted by how Zip had turned against the Stokes Crime Family and instead joined Diamondback's crew, suggesting Zip had become disloyal, although Zip had noted that Barrett was as much in Diamondback's pocket as he was.

Zip learning what Diamondback intends
However, Barrett told Zip that, although he was doing business with Diamondback, he had not become Diamondback's boy, and suggested that Zip had become his bitch, before walking away, leaving Zip to consider his comment about his father's legacy. Returning to Diamondback, Zip suggested that Barrett was old and did not understand how Harlem's crime world worked any more, before questioning what was inside the box that Diamondback was examining. Diamondback told Zip that the box contained one of the Seven Deadly Sins, which he intended to use on Luke Cage once they found him, calling it his wrath.

Executed by Shades
Zip collecting Shades from the police
Zip was tasked with collecting Shades from the 29th Precinct Police Station, once he had been bailed out, before taking him to an abandoned building. As they walked inside, Shades asked Zip when Diamondback had hired the new crew members, to which Zip noted that since he lost control of Harlem's Paradise, Diamondback had to change things up. Zip then suggested that the New York City Police Department may have attempted to recruit Shades to rat while he was in custody.

Zip attempts to assassinate Shades
However, Shades stopped Zip, and demanded that he never question his loyalties again, before Zip led him to the elevator, which began taking them upstairs. As they went up, Shades asked if Diamondback was upstairs, to which Zip noted that he was full of questions, before he took Shades off guard and threw a wire around his throat, furiously attempting to strangle Shades, who tried his best to fight back, while the other crew members stood back and watched. As Zip and Shades fought for the control, they slammed each other into the elevator walls, as Zip got closer to strangling the life out of Shades.

Zip is beaten and threatened by Shades
Despite Zip coming close to killing him, Shades was able to grab the gun from one of the crew members, which he proceeded to use to kill them both, before breaking free of Zip's grip and holding the gun to his head. As Zip stood helpless, Shades laughed in his face and suggested that they head to the top floor, as Zip reluctantly reactivated the elevator to take them upstairs, while Shades kept his gun aimed at his head. Once they were on the roof, the terrified Zip was pushed forward, as he insisted that he had just been following orders, as Shades called Zip a puppet and demanded to know who gave the order.

Zip admits Diamondback gave the order
Although Zip initially refused to confess who had ordered Shades' death, he was then struck in the face with the barrel of the gun, knocking him down to the floor, as Shades had continued to demand some answers, striking him a second time. Finally, with the gun still being aimed at his head, Zip confessed that it was Diamondback who had ordered Shades' death, explaining that ever since Shades had been attempting to push himself to a higher position and had questioned Diamondback's leadership by asking too many questions, Diamondback had then concluded that Shades needed to be dealt with, by having Zip kill him.

Zip being shot and killed by Shades
With Zip still kneeling on the floor, Shades held the gun to his head and told him that Romeo would have been ashamed of him, calling him a disappointment. In response, Zip simply laughed at Shades, commenting that he was the second person to tell him that, following Turk Barrett's comments, before he insisted that he was actually his own man. Shades had then told Zip to tell Romeo that himself, before shooting Zip through the head, killing him instantly, as Zip's body dropped to the floor. Before leaving, Shades found a pair of sunglasses inside of Zip's jacket pocket and took them.
