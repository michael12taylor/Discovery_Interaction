Samuel Thomas "Sam" Wilson is a former United States Air Force pararescue airman, who left active duty when his wing-man Riley died during combat, instead choosing to help other veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. At this time, Wilson had met Captain America and was drawn to his conflict with HYDRA, as Captain America needed help from anyone not associated with S.H.I.E.L.D. since they had been infiltrated by HYDRA. Retaking his title as the Falcon, Wilson had then assisted with destroying all of Alexander Pierce's schemes of world domination. Following their victory against Pierce's HYDRA units, Falcon then agreed to assist Captain America in tracking down the Winter Soldier, who was in fact Captain America's close friend who had been brainwashed.

As Falcon continued searching for the Winter Soldier, he was then recruited into the Avengers, since their original team had been disbanded following the defeat of Ultron. During his time with the Avengers, Falcon briefly encountered Ant-Man before assisting in defeating Crossbones. In the aftermath of several battles that had killed civilians, the Avengers were then forced into following the Sokovia Accords, putting them all under the government's full control. However, as the Winter Soldier was blamed for terrorist attacks by Helmut Zemo, Falcon stood by Captain America with protecting the Winter Soldier, which had then caused the Avengers Civil War. In the wake of this clash, Falcon, and several other Avengers who were loyal to Captain America, were defeated by Iron Man, and locked into the Raft, until Captain America freed them as they became fugitives.

While the Avengers were still disbanded, Earth had come under attack by Thanos and his Black Order, bringing Falcon and his allies out of hiding. Learning that Thanos intended to steal the Mind Stone from Vision, Falcon joined the Avengers in taking Vision to Wakanda for his protection, while they had then tried to keep Thanos' forces back. However, they were eventually defeated as Thanos claimed the Infinity Stones and used them to cause the Snap, killing trillions including Falcon. Five years later, the victims of the Snap were resurrected by the surviving Avengers, and Falcon rejoined their battles against Thanos as they finally defeated him at the cost of Tony Stark's life. In the aftermath of the battle, Falcon learned that Captain America returned to the past and had lived a full life with Peggy Carter, and seeing him return as an old man, was given the shield by Rogers.

Initially declining the shield and giving it up to the Smithsonian Institution under the impression that it would remain a display piece, Wilson was disgusted when the Government had then appointed John Walker as their next Captain America. Wilson instead refocused on fighting the Flag Smashers, forming an unlikely alliance with Bucky Barnes and Helmut Zemo to track them down. However, as Walker began to lose control, due to taking the Super Soldier Serum, and brutally murdered one of the Flag Smashers, Nico, in public, Wilson retook the shield to prevent further murders. Following some soul searching and a discussion with Isaiah Bradley, Wilson had finally taken up the mantle of Captain America in time to intervene with the Flag Smashers' attack on the GRC, stopping Karli Morgenthau, as he convinced the GRC to treat refugee communities created by the Blip fairly, and inspiring a new generation of heroes.

Biography
Early Life
Wilson Family Seafood
Sam Wilson was born on September 23, 1978 in Harlem to Paul and Darlene Wilson. He was raised in Louisiana along with his sister, Sarah. Wilson's father would often take him to go fishing at a spot in Grand Isle. Wilson had an aunt, whom he referred to as his TT, whom he was very close to. When his TT passed away, Wilson attended her funeral, which was well attended and continued for many days, celebrating her life.

Military Career
Serving Two Tours
Sam Wilson joined the United States Air Force after qualifying and passing all the requirements for pararescue. He served two combat tours in the Global War on Terrorism campaign, being sent out to Afghanistan during his service. Assigned onto the 58th Rescue Squadron, Wilson was a test pilot for the EXO-7 Falcon along with his wingman, Riley. During his time serving in the Air Force, Wilson often found that he would be the most comfortable when he was sleeping on the ground while using rocks as pillows, since there were few other options.

Losing Riley
Wilson alongside his former wingman Riley
One of Wilson's missions involved successfully capturing Khalid Khandil in Bakhmala, Afghanistan, being once again teamed up with Riley. However, during a night rescue mission, Riley was killed after his EXO-7 Falcon was hit by an RPG and Wilson could do nothing to save him. Having lost his close friend, Wilson had a hard time finding a reason to continue serving and soon left the Air Force, deciding to focus his efforts on helping veterans recovering from combat Post-traumatic stress disorder back home.

Meeting Captain America
Surprise Running Companion
Wilson encounters Steve Rogers while jogging
Having returned home from the United States Air Force, Wilson was hired by the Department of Veterans Affairs, with the intention of counseling the veterans who had been suffering from Post-traumatic stress disorder. While out for his morning jog across Washington, D.C., Wilson soon found his early morning exercise being interrupted by Steve Rogers, who had managed to casually run by Wilson several times, teasing him as he went, much to Wilson's annoyance.

Wilson attempting to catch his breath back
With Rogers having run past him multiple times throughout their jog, Wilson eventually stopped to catch his breath as Rogers came over to rejoin him. Commenting on how fast he had run, Wilson jokingly challenged Rogers to run another lap, questioning if he could do it in the blink of an eye. Rogers had then questioned what branch of the Air Force Wilson was a part of, and Wilson explained his situation before introducing himself as Rogers helped him back onto his feet.

Wilson introduces himself to Steve Rogers
As Rogers introduced himself, Wilson had then made it clear that he already knew who he was based upon his incredible running abilities. He then questioned what it was like for Rogers to have been woken up in 2011 after living in the 1940s during World War II, to which Rogers only claimed that it was taking some getting used to. Before Rogers could walk away, Wilson had then noted that most other Armed Forces veterans, himself included, had struggled to get used to sleeping on a comfortable bed upon returning home, which Rogers related to. The pair then bonded about their experiences while serving in the military and similarities in readjusting without a war zone.

Wilson and Steve Rogers discuss their lives
Once Wilson asked Rogers about the differences between living now compared to the 1940s, he listened to Rogers explain why it was not so bad, commenting on all the improvements with their food and technology in the modern day, including the internet. Hearing that Rogers was still trying to catch up on everything that he missed, Wilson then recommended Marvin Gaye for him to listen to, and Rogers added it to his To-Do List.

Wilson first encountering Natasha Romanoff
The conversation was cut short, however, as Rogers was called away on a S.H.I.E.L.D. mission by Natasha Romanoff. Wilson encouraged Rogers to visit him at the VA some day, ostensibly so Wilson could impress the women who also worked there, while Rogers teased him over his jogging abilities. As Romanoff had arrived to collect Rogers in her car, joking that they would put him in the Smithsonian as an exhibit, Wilson gave her a flirtatious greeting before watching her drive away with Rogers.

Advising Steve Rogers
Wilson giving his speech to former soldiers
Wilson held a group session with Armed Forces veterans who were suffering from PTSD as he helped Garcia, who was struggling with visions of IEDs in the roads. Once Garcia had finished her confessions, Wilson spoke to the group about what they kept with them from their experiences with war and what they left behind. He used a metaphor of carrying the memories in a bag as he offered advice in separating their time in the military from their time being at home, where they were trying to relive as civilians.

Wilson has a conversation with Steve Rogers
With their meeting over, Wilson once again met with Steve Rogers, who complimented him on his insights to Garcia, having arrived to listen to the last few minutes of his meeting. Wilson then told Rogers about his time in Afghanistan and how he lost his friend, Riley, during a mission. Wilson explained that once Riley died, he had lost his own passion for serving in the military but found a new purpose in his life by helping these veterans readjust after returning to their homes.

Wilson giving Steve Rogers some life advice
Rogers admitted to Wilson that he was struggling with the idea of what to do with himself if he was not a soldier, since he also didn't know how to leave S.H.I.E.L.D. and just live a normal life, to which Wilson jokingly suggested that he could join Ultimate Fighting due to his Super Soldier Serum. However, Wilson got serious once again as he then assured Rogers that he could do whatever he wanted, before questioning what it was that actually made him happy in life.

Helping the Fugitives
Wilson agreeing to help Rogers and Romanoff
Having returned to his apartment after jogging through Washington, D.C., Wilson heard a knock at his door and was surprised to find a disheveled Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff, who had come seeking refuge as they claimed that everybody they knew was currently attempting to kill them. Despite having little context to their current situation, Wilson offered them both help without a second thought, opening his door for Rogers and Romanoff to come inside.

Wilson offers some breakfast to Steve Rogers
While they were inside his home, Wilson made the pair breakfast and allowed them to use his shower in order to clean themselves up, as they had been involved in an explosion at Camp Lehigh. Despite his own choice to leave the United States Air Force, Wilson had felt that being called upon by Captain America simply meant he had to return. Having finished making breakfast, Wilson came upstairs as he informed Rogers and Romanoff that it was ready if they wanted it.

Wilson learns of the threat of Alexander Pierce
As the group ate together, Wilson learned of the full details of Rogers' and Romanoff's current predicament, as he was informed about how S.H.I.E.L.D. had been infiltrated by HYDRA for decades, resulting in them being betrayed by Alexander Pierce who had order the assassination of themselves as well as Director Nick Fury. Having learned how dangerous their situation was if Pierce succeeded in his plans with Project Insight, Wilson had then offered his assistance.

Wilson reveals his past career to Steve Rogers
Although Rogers was reluctant to accept, Wilson had insisted before then revealing to them that he was part of a military project that used the EXO-7 Falcon, with Romanoff recognizing their unit as the one that captured Khalid Khandil in Afghanistan. Rogers had also noticed a picture of Wilson and Riley. Seeing that Wilson could be beneficial to the mission to capture and question Jasper Sitwell, Rogers accepted his help as they all agreed to steal the EXO-7 Falcon together.

Kidnapping of Agent Sitwell
Wilson calmly threatening Jasper Sitwell
Having retrieved the EXO-7 Falcon from Fort Meade, Wilson traveled with both Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff to find and interrogate Jasper Sitwell. Wilson called Sitwell on the phone after he had a meeting with Senator Stern and threatened to have him shot if he did not do exactly as instructed; he ordered Sitwell to go into a car that drove him to a nearby building to be questioned by Rogers and Romanoff on the roof.

Falcon dropping Jasper Sitwell onto the roof
During his initial interrogation by Rogers, Sitwell denied any knowledge of HYDRA's takeover of S.H.I.E.L.D.. As they grew tired of his lies, Romanoff had instead resorted to kicking Sitwell off the building, in order to scare him into finally giving the answers they needed. After Sitwell fell several stories, Falcon then flew in at the last moment, caught him in mid-air, and brought Sitwell back onto the top of the building, dropping him with some force on the ground.

Wilson listens to Jasper Sitwell's confessions
As Falcon retracted his wings and rejoined Rogers and Romanoff, he watched as Sitwell confessed, since the fall scared him so much. Falcon listened while Sitwell revealed how Arnim Zola's algorithm was in fact their plan to locate any potential threats to HYDRA in the future, and that Alexander Pierce intended to use Project Insight in order to assassinate these people of interest the moment the Insight Helicarriers were launched.

Encountering Winter Soldier
Wilson ordering Jasper Sitwell to remain quiet
Having learned of Alexander Pierce's sinister plans of the worldwide massacre, Wilson drove Jasper Sitwell towards the Triskelion, where they planned to use his clearances to gain access to, and shut down Project Insight before Pierce could activate it. Sitwell, however, insisted that this concept was a terrible idea but Wilson ordered that he keep quiet while they were driving there as Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff then continued to discuss the fine details of their new plan.

Wilson witnesses the Winter Soldier's attack
However, before the group could get to the Triskelion, someone suddenly landed on their roof as a robotic arm ripped Sitwell out of the window and into the path of a speeding truck, killing him. As the attacker began shooting into the car, Wilson slammed on the breaks, launching him off the vehicle, and they were faced with the Winter Soldier. Before the group could react, another vehicle had slammed into the back of their car, which drove Wilson and the others towards the Winter Soldier.

Wilson and his allies escape the Winter Soldier
With Wilson unable to do anything, the Winter Soldier proceeded to rip the steering wheel out of his hands in an attempt to cause a fatal crash. While the car spun out of control, Rogers then grabbed Wilson and Romanoff and threw them all out, using his shield to protect them as they skidded on the road at high speed. When they recovered from the crash, a fight then erupted in the streets, in which Wilson dove for cover while Rogers was knocked off the bridge by a grenade.

Wilson battles against all the HYDRA soldiers
Once Romanoff was also thrown off the bridge because of the Winter Soldier's grenade launcher, Wilson had managed to remain hidden as the HYDRA mercenaries then began repelling off the bridge in order to continue the fight, shooting at Rogers with a mini-gun. Surprising one mercenary, Wilson was able to knock him off the bridge and take his gun, using it to give Rogers covering fire. Wilson then instructed Rogers to help keep the Winter Soldier away from Romanoff.

Falcon knocks down the Winter Soldier
Eventually, Wilson had managed to defeat the unit of HYDRA soldiers from the bridge and then went in search of Rogers and Romanoff on the streets of Washington, D.C., taking his EXO-7 Falcon with him as protection. Before long, Falcon discovered Rogers battling the Winter Soldier and flew in to assist, coming in just as their fight had briefly paused due to a moment's confusion. Falcon was able to kick the Winter Soldier aside just before he could shoot Rogers.

Falcon is surrounded by Brock Rumlow's men
While Falcon had landed on the streets, the Winter Soldier recovered from the assault and had attempted to shoot at Rogers again, only for Romanoff to then shoot a grenade launcher at him, which caused him to flee. Before they could get away, however, Rogers, Romanoff and Wilson were then surrounded and captured by some of HYDRA's infiltrators within S.H.I.E.L.D., led by Brock Rumlow. As Wilson was pinned against the car at gunpoint, he had his Exo-7 Falcon removed while Rumlow and Jack Rollins secured Rogers. The three of them were put in the back of a van to be executed later, with Romanoff wounded from being shot at by the Winter Soldier earlier.

Meeting Nick Fury
Wilson is taken away by Brock Rumlow's men
Under the watchful eyes of HYDRA's soldiers, Wilson and the others were transported towards a secret location where Brock Rumlow intended to have them all killed. During their journey, Steve Rogers explained that Winter Soldier was in fact his friend, Bucky Barnes, who seemingly died in World War II. Wilson wondered how this could be possible, and Rogers explained that Arnim Zola had experimented on Barnes, which helped him to survive his apparent death.

Wilson and the others are saved by Maria Hill
As they drove along, Wilson noticed that Natasha Romanoff was currently losing a lot of blood from her injury and warned the guards that she needed a doctor or else she would bleed out. However, much to Wilson's great surprise, one of the HYDRA guards then used a Taser Rod to attack the other guard and knock him unconscious, before she revealed herself to really be Maria Hill. While Hill had questioned who Wilson was, she used the Mouse Hole to escape with the three before Rumlow even noticed.

Wilson learning that Nick Fury is actually alive
Having gotten away from their HYDRA kidnappers, Hill then brought them inside the S.H.I.E.L.D. Dam Facility where Romanoff was finally given medical attention from Doctor Fine. While Romanoff's gunshot wound was being treated, Hill revealed to Wilson and the others that Director Nick Fury was also there, still recuperating from the recent assassination attempt orchestrated by the Winter Soldier, with nobody, other than them, currently being aware of his survival.

Wilson being introduced to Director Nick Fury
Wilson listened as Fury and Fine discussed the list of injuries Fury had sustained when he was attacked by the Winter Soldier. Fury explained that he used Tetrodotoxin B, which had been developed by Bruce Banner, to slow his heartbeat down to the point that it appeared that he had died. When Rogers questioned why he had kept this as a secret, Hill noted that their enemies needed to believe that Fury was dead in order to ensure that any second assassination attempt was not made. While the others remained unsure about the situation, Wilson listened as Fury continued explaining that he had been unsure who he could actually trust since S.H.I.E.L.D. was compromised.

Wilson and the others discuss their next move
Wilson rejoined the team while together, they focused on their work to stop HYDRA's plans as Fury discussed Alexander Pierce's betrayal and how they could not contact the World Security Council to stop the launch of Project Insight. As Fury revealed three microchips, Wilson asked what they were, to which Hill explained that they would use these chips to hack into the Helicarriers directly and cause them to target each other, warning that millions would die if they failed.

Wilson insists he will stand with Steve Rogers
When Rogers told Fury that he intended to destroy not only the Project Insight Helicarriers, but all of S.H.I.E.L.D. with them, Fury protested, insisting that HYDRA had tricked them all and S.H.I.E.L.D. was innocent. Despite his protests, Hill and Romanoff agreed with Rogers, to which Wilson affirmed that he was also standing with his friend, joking that he would go where Rogers went, only slower. With that, Fury finally relented and gave Rogers control over their mission.

Wilson and Rogers discussing Bucky Barnes
Knowing that their plans to defeat Pierce would undoubtedly be met with the full forces of HYDRA, Wilson later talked with Rogers about what they should do once they encountered the Winter Soldier again. Wilson insisted to Rogers that Barnes was the kind of guy you have to stop rather than save in spite of their friendship in World War II. However, Rogers remained convinced he could save Barnes, as he then proclaimed that he would find his uniform to fight their upcoming battle against HYDRA.

Battle at the Triskelion
Falcon helps to take over of the control room
Having assisted in stealing Captain America's Uniform from the Smithsonian exhibit, Falcon joined him and Maria Hill as they broke into the Triskelion and secured the control room. Once they all had taken full control of the situation, Captain America informed every S.H.I.E.L.D. agent of HYDRA's infiltration into their organization as well as Alexander Pierce's true plans for Project Insight, asking them to trust his word.

Falcon complimenting Steve Rogers' speech
Falcon listened as Captain America told the S.H.I.E.L.D agents that while many had been ordered to hunt him down by STRIKE teams, he urged them to stand against the enemy before Pierce was able to succeed with launching Project Insight, revealing that they already killed Nick Fury to ensure their plan went ahead. Once he had finished, Falcon jokingly asked Captain America if he had practiced the speech beforehand, or simply made it up as he went along.

Falcon and Captain America run into battle
With the Project Insight Helicarriers now launching and the few remaining S.H.I.E.L.D. agents being led by Sharon Carter in their fight against HYDRA, Falcon and Captain America charged outside to destroy these Helicarriers. As they jogged forward, Falcon questioned how they would be able to tell the good guys from the bad guys, but Captain America just calmly reminded Falcon that only the bad guys would be attempting to shoot him out of the sky.

Falcon avoiding all of the Helicarrier's gunfire
On that note, Captain America jumped off the platform onto the rising Helicarrier while Falcon activated his EXO-7 Falcon and took off. As Falcon flew in line with the Helicarriers, he immediately found himself being targeted and attempted to avoid the gunfire by using his advanced flying techniques. Hill asked Falcon for an update on his status, and he informed her that he was engaging the enemy as he flew directly into the line of fire, swiftly diving through the air to avoid all the Helicarrier's shots.

Falcon shooting down several HYDRA guards
Diving onto the deck of a Helicarrier, Falcon had managed to surprise one HYDRA guard by crashing directly into him, before then spinning around as he armed himself with his handguns and shooting down a second guard. However, before Falcon could sneak onboard the Helicarrier to plant their microchip, he then suddenly came under attack from a Quinjet, which chased him across the deck while shooting at him. Falcon used the parked Quinjets to take cover.

Falcon getting targeted by an enemy Quinjet
Suddenly, the Quinjet fired a missile at Falcon, barely missing him and destroying a parked Quinjet he was flying by. The explosion knocked Falcon to the ground, as the Quinjet came out of the smoke and attempted to shoot him down. However, Falcon swiftly recovered as he then dived backwards off the Helicarrier, shooting his twin guns at the HYDRA pilots before reactivating his EXO-7 Falcon and flying away, with the Quinjet still chasing him down and shooting at him.

While Captain America successfully inserted the first microchip in one of the Helicarriers, Falcon continued to desperately try and get away from the Quinjet that was still pursuing him. While Falcon flew on the underbelly of the Helicarrier, the Quinjet had fired dozens of missiles at him. Falcon used all of his maneuvering abilities to avoid them, retracting his wings and allowing himself to fall as all of the missiles then smashed into the side of the Helicarrier.

Falcon manages to get onboard the Helicarrier
With the Quinjet pilots mistakenly thinking they had just killed Falcon in the explosion, he was able to use the hole in the underbelly of the Helicarrier, which was caused by the missiles, to get inside and access the control systems to insert their second microchip, granting Hill control over two out of the three Helicarriers. With that portion of their mission completed, Falcon then dove back outside in order to board the final Helicarrier and destroy Project Insight.

Falcon rescues Captain America from his fall
Before Falcon could head onto the third Helicarrier, he was contacted by Captain America, who requested a ride since he was under attack from several HYDRA agents. Falcon then witnessed Captain America dive off the second Helicarrier, falling hundreds of feet to the ground below. Falcon flew after him at full speed, managing to catch Captain America in the air and fly him to the final Helicarrier. He had also jokingly commenting that Captain America was a lot heavier than he looked.

Falcon attempting to shoot the Winter Soldier
However, just as Falcon and Captain America shared some humor, they were ambushed by the Winter Soldier, who charged forward and threw Captain America from the Helicarrier. Fearing his friend was falling to his death, Falcon attempted to save Captain America, only for the Winter Soldier to grab one of his wings and thrown him backwards to continue their fight. Falcon then drew his twin guns and shot at the Winter Soldier, who was able to avoid the bullets and take cover.

Falcon being kicked over by the Winter Soldier
As Falcon had then tried once again to rescue Captain America from falling, he flew upwards only for the Winter Soldier soldier to use his grappling wire to grab ahold of Falcon's wing and pull him back down to the ground, before tearing one of the wings off the EXO-7 Falcon. As Falcon then attempted to get back on his feet, the Winter Soldier charged forward and kicked him off the Helicarrier, with Falcon plummeting towards the ground below with his now badly damaged wing suit.

Falcon landing onto the ground without injury
As Falcon fell hundreds of feet below, he was then able to cut the second wing free before activating his parachute, allowing him to land safely in the Triskelion. Falcon confirmed that Captain America was alive and still onboard the Helicarrier, as he had gone to continue their mission alone. Falcon was warned by Hill that Brock Rumlow was now on his way to the World Security Council in order to then intercept Black Widow, so he went to keep Rumlow away from the group.

Facing Brock Rumlow
Wilson goes head to head with Brock Rumlow
Refocusing his mission on protecting Nick Fury, Wilson encountered Brock Rumlow inside the Triskelion as Rumlow was on his way to challenge Black Widow and Fury in order to try and rescue his commander, Alexander Pierce, so they could escape during the chaos of the battle and kill the World Security Council. Wilson hid behind the door and ambushed Rumlow, striking him in the face and attempting to knock him out with a knee to the head.

Wilson ready to fight against Brock Rumlow
However, Rumlow quickly proved himself to be a formidable fighter as he blocked Wilson's knee and head-butted him with some force, knocking Wilson onto the ground. While Wilson slowly got back onto his feet, Rumlow had removed his jacket and Bulletproof Vest as he then proclaimed to Wilson that his punishment for trying to go against HYDRA would now cause him considerable pain, since that was the only way HYDRA believed the world could regain order.

Wilson being overpowered by Brock Rumlow
As Rumlow continued to rant about HYDRA's schemes, Wilson readied himself for a fight and simply told his rival to shut up, so they could. The two soldiers charged towards each other for an intense fight in hand-to-hand combat. As their battle reached its conclusion, Rumlow managed to gain the upper hand, using all of his own slightly refined combat techniques to overpower Wilson before throwing him across the room. Rumlow then began taunting him by standing over the injured Wilson.

Wilson desperately running for his life
Before Rumlow was able to finish him off, claiming that Wilson was out of his depth, their battle was cut short; Wilson spotted the final Project Insight Helicarrier heading straight towards the Triskelion behind the overconfident Rumlow, having been successfully reprogrammed and destroyed in the battle. Using his head start to his advantage, Wilson ran for his life as the Helicarrier crashed into the building, with Rumlow being buried under the debris.

Wilson leaping out of the window just in time
With only moments to spare, Wilson then contacted Black Widow as he demanded she bring the Helicopter to him. Wilson was forced to jump from the 41st floor of the building, where he was then caught by a Helicopter piloted by Nick Fury and Black Widow. Although Wilson had berated the pair for almost killing him with the helicopter blades, they soon turned their attention to escaping the explosions, and locating Captain America, who was onboard the Helicarrier.

Search for Bucky Barnes
Wilson waits by Steve Rogers' hospital bed
Eventually, the injured Steve Rogers was found unconscious near the ruins of the Triskelion following a fight with the Winter Soldier that had left him almost beaten to death, with a bullet wound inside his stomach. Wilson stayed beside Rogers' bed until he recovered, and played the Marvin Gaye music he had previously recommended to him. As Rogers awakened, the first words he said to Wilson were "on your left", causing Wilson to smile in relief and amusement.

Wilson refuses to go with Director Nick Fury
With much of HYDRA's leadership either arrested or gone into hiding, Wilson and Rogers then went to the fake gravesite for Nick Fury, and were met by him. Wilson greeted S.H.I.E.L.D.'s former leader, who then explained that he would be traveling to Europe to seek out the surviving members of HYDRA. Fury offered Wilson to join him on his mission to exterminate HYDRA. Wilson refused, however, stating that he was more a soldier and not a spy, which Fury accepted.

Wilson agrees to help find the Winter Soldier
The pair said their goodbyes to Fury, who asked them to still keep his survival a secret, before they were joined by Natasha Romanoff, who gave Rogers a file on the Winter Soldier. Wilson confirmed that Rogers would be going after his oldest friend, and agreed to help him in his search for Bucky Barnes. During their quest, Rogers was called to rejoin the Avengers and battle Wolfgang von Strucker's HYDRA division, leaving Wilson to look for Barnes on his own.

Avengers Party
Wilson and Steve Rogers play a game of pool
Wilson had been invited to the party held at Avengers Tower in order to celebrate the Avengers' most recent successful battle against HYDRA which had led to the seeming defeat of the final HYDRA cells, due to the capture of HYDRA's main leadership, Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, as well as the Scepter they had been hunting ever since the Battle of New York, ending up in the hands of the Avengers.

Wilson and Steve Rogers talk about the world
As their Avengers' party had continued, Wilson was later introduced to, and shook hands with Tony Stark and later played a game of pool with Steve Rogers while drinking. Wilson and Rogers had later talked about their battle against Baron Strucker's forces, as Wilson jokingly wanted to know why he had not been invited to assist in the fight as he had been helping Rogers in their search for Bucky Barnes for the last few months before Rogers had been called by the Avengers.

Wilson discusses him joining the Avengers
When Rogers had attempted to apologize that Falcon had not been invited to their fight against Baron Strucker, Wilson had still assured Rogers that he was not massively interested in joining the Avengers at that point, claiming that the Avengers were crazy. They went on to discuss how Rogers was recently attempting to find an apartment in his home town of Brooklyn, with Rogers noting that he was not sure if he would even be able to afford to get any home in Brooklyn.

Joining the Avengers
Falcon flies into the New Avengers Facility
As Falcon continued searching for Bucky Barnes, the Avengers were then involved in a conflict with Ultron that, while successful, had lead to massive changes in the team. In the wake of Clint Barton's decision to retire and Tony Stark's demotion to the non-combatant, and the departure of Thor, Falcon was recruited into the Avengers' newest roster alongside their other allies who had proved themselves worthy members, including War Machine, Vision and Scarlet Witch.

Falcon looks to Captain America as his leader
Falcon had then arrived at the New Avengers Facility with his newest version of his EXO-7 Falcon, complete with the upgraded mechanical wings that were more combat ready, having been upgraded by Stark. Once the new Avengers had arrived to the new facility, they had then begun their training under the leadership of Captain America as well as Black Widow, ready to take on any future world threatening events that arrived, as Falcon proudly looked up to his friend and leader.

Duel at the New Avengers Facility
Falcon confronting and questioning Ant-Man
At the New Avengers Facility, Falcon detected an intruder in the base and decided to investigate. Flying onto the roof, Falcon then spotted a man wearing a suit that seemed to make him the size of an ant. Once it was made clear that Falcon could see this man despite his size, the man regrew and introduced himself as Scott with the code-name Ant-Man, noting that he was a big fan of the Avengers, which Falcon appreciated but remained serious about their situation.

Falcon attempting to battle against Ant-Man
Falcon demanded to know why Ant-Man was at the facility; the man claimed to simply be needing to borrow the Signal Decoy from them which he intended to use to save their world, noting that Falcon and all the Avengers should understand what that was like. Believing that Ant-Man was a sort of spy, Falcon attempted to arrest him and bring him inside for question, only for Ant-Man to shrink and punch Falcon with a surprising amount of force, resulting with the pair beginning to fight and being knocked from the facility's rooftop, where Falcon had then drawn his twin guns and attempted to shoot the intruder.

Falcon's flight suit is sabotaged by Ant-Man
During the battle, Falcon had learned that despite his small size, Ant-Man was a formidable opponent as he was only just able to keep up with him as Ant-Man used his powers of shrinking to remain almost undetectable. Falcon used his Combat Goggles to track him down and deliver punches that forced Ant-Man to regrow. When Ant-Man managed to get away from the Avenger and flew inside the facility on the back of an ant, Falcon followed Ant-Man into the Facility until he had managed to shrink down and disable the EXO-7 Falcon from the inside, dropping him onto the floor before escaping the Avenger.

Falcon informing of his defeat from Ant-Man
Falcon hit the ground hard and, by the time he then recovered from that impact, with his suit damaged, Falcon was unable to track Ant-Man who already escaped with the Signal Decoy. Forced to accept defeat, Falcon then said to Natasha Romanoff through their comm link it was important to him that Captain America would never know about this embarrassing failure. Falcon then rejoined the Avengers in battling HYDRA, who had collected parts from a destroyed Ultron Sentries and had created Ultimo. Falcon then joined the Avengers to an attack and together they had managed to destroy Ultimo.

Search for Ant-Man
Wilson looks for any information on Ant-Man
Despite his embarrassing defeat at the New Avengers Facility, Falcon was still impressed by Ant-Man's abilities during their fight. Seeking another hero who could potentially assist the Avengers in their missions, and having heard of Ant-Man using his own abilities to stop the sale of a new super-weapon called the Yellowjacket Suit which was almost handed over to HYDRA by Darren Cross, Wilson began seeking out Ant-Man, despite only knowing his first name was Scott.

Wilson getting a lead on Scott Lang's location
Eventually, Wilson had encountered the Writer who had connections with many underground heroes with unusual abilities, including one who could crawl up the walls. Wilson asked the writer whether or not she knew of any newer heroes using technology that allowed him to shrink and if she knew how he would be able to get into contact with him. This led her to tracking Ant-Man down by meeting Ignacio, who put her into contact with his cousin Luis, a close friend of a friend of Ant-Man who agreed to help him, as Wilson had told the writer to tell Ignacio to tell Luis that he was currently looking for Ant-Man.

Attack on the IFID Headquarters
Falcon looks out for Crossbones' next attack
Falcon had rejoined the Avengers as they tracked Brock Rumlow and his crew into Lagos in Nigeria, having just learned that Rumlow was intending on stealing a biological weapon. As Falcon had listened to the Avengers' discussions, he commented to Black Widow that she could be paranoid, before Captain America had insisted that they all remained focus on stopping Rumlow, although Falcon noted that Rumlow hated them all too much to not engage them in a fight.

Falcon realizes what Crossbones is planning
However, Captain America caught sight of a garbage truck that was charging through the streets, as Falcon sent Redwing down onto the ground to scan it. X-Raying the truck, Falcon learned that the truck was filled to maximum weight and the driver was armed, as they had realized that it was being used as a battering ram. Captain America ordered the Avengers to assemble, as Falcon had activated his EXO-7 Falcon and dove off of the building and flew towards the truck.

Falcon knocking out Crossbones' mercenaries
The Avengers realized the truck was heading towards the Institute for Infectious Diseases, as it smashed through the security wall, allowing Rumlow, who was going by the codename of Crossbones, to enter in the building with his team of well armed mercenaries. Falcon caught up with Captain America and flew him to the battle, dropping him by Crossbones' mercenaries, while Falcon flew onto the bridge, and had surprised two mercenaries, kicking him in the head as he landed.

Falcon and Scarlet Witch take out the soldiers
Before the forth mercenary could even react, Falcon had then drawn his twin guns and shot him. Upon confirming the number of men that Crossbones had with him, Falcon was rejoined by Scarlet Witch, who entrapped another mercenary with her powers, before launching him into the air as Falcon had knocked him back down to the ground with some force. Using Redwing's scanners, Falcon had confirmed where Crossbones was, as Captain America went to engage him directly.

Falcon shields himself from Crossbones' men
With Captain America inside the facility, battling against Crossbones' mercenaries in an attempt to stop the terrorist from escaping with the biological weapon, Falcon had then defended Scarlet Witch from any of the other mercenaries who were attempting to stop them. While he was using his wings as protection, Falcon shot at all of Crossbones' mercenaries, while Scarlet Witch had used her powers to extract the poisonous gas from inside the facility, letting it evaporate in the air.

Falcon using his airstrike against the soldiers
As the mercenaries had used their trucks as cover, Falcon resorted to turning his back to them, while his wings protected him and Scarlet Witch, before firing two missiles behind him, which then killed all of the mercenaries upon impact, while Scarlet Witch had succeeded in removing all the poisonous gas from the facility. However, during this time, Crossbones had been able to take the biological weapon, while almost killing Black Widow and Captain America during his escape.

Falcon chasing all the escaping mercenaries
Having been updated by Captain America about the situation, Falcon flew into the streets of Lagos, where he found Crossbones' armored car crashed. Falcon then used his Combat Goggles to scan the area, spotting four of Crossbones' mercenaries while they were splitting up into the crowds of terrified civilians, as Black Widow rejoined the fight and chased two of the four to see who had the biological weapon, as Captain America had then gone in search for Crossbones himself.

Falcon attempts to find the biological weapon
Flying through the crowds of civilians, Falcon had then swiftly caught up to two of Crossbones' mercenaries, as he slammed into one and knocked him out. Falcon had then turned his attention to the second mercenary, who had attempted to shoot him, only for Falcon to use his wings to block all the gunshots, before launching into the air and kicking the mercenary into the wall. Falcon then checked their bags, only to realize that neither of them had the biological weapon.
