Thor Odinson is the Asgardian God of Thunder, the former king of Asgard and New Asgard, and a founding member of the Avengers. When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior reignited a conflict between Asgard and Jotunheim, Thor was denied the right to become king, stripped of his power, and banished to Earth by Odin. While exiled on Earth, Thor learned humility, finding love with Jane Foster, and helped save his new friends from the Destroyer sent by Loki. Due to his selfless act of sacrifice, Thor redeemed himself in his father's eyes and was granted his power once more, which he then used to defeat Loki's schemes of genocide.

Upon being welcomed back to Asgard as a hero, Thor was forced to return to Earth in order to retrieve Loki after he had survived a fall through a black hole and had begun his attempt at world domination, having taken possession of the Tesseract. Thor joined the Avengers under the guidance of S.H.I.E.L.D. and stood with them to stop the schemes of his own adopted brother, eventually following the newly formed team as they battled against Loki's army of the Chitauri during the Battle of New York until Loki was eventually defeated by the Avengers, captured and returned onto Asgard to await justice for his crimes against Earth.

Thor returned to Asgard having defeated his brother's schemes, as he then helped the Asgardian Armies restore peace across all of the Nine Realms during the War of the Nine Realms. However, the peace proved to be short-lived as Thor then fought the Dark Elves during the Second Dark Elf Conflict as they had attempted to plunge the Nine Realms into eternal darkness. During these events, Thor was reunited with Jane Foster who had become host to the Aether and a target of the Dark Elves, with Thor being forced to free Loki from imprisonment for his aid. Eventually, the Aether was removed from Foster's body and Loki seemingly sacrificed Thor from Kurse, leading to the Dark Elves and Malekith's defeat. Thor renounced his claim to the throne and left Asgard for Earth so he could stay with Foster.

During his stay on Earth, Thor helped the Avengers once again, this time in their attempts to locate Loki's Scepter. This also lead to him joining the fight against HYDRA. Following HYDRA's defeat and the capture of Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, the team had to stop the newly created Ultron, a rogue invention inadvertently created by Tony Stark which had threatened to wipe out all of humanity and replace it with its own Ultron Sentries. Once Ultron had been defeated, Thor promised his Avengers allies that he would return and went back to Asgard to investigate the visions he saw when being manipulated by Scarlet Witch of the Infinity Stones. In his investigations, Thor also discovered that Loki was still alive and had usurped Odin's royal throne during Thor's absence.

To aid in both pursuing his brother and finding his father to return peace to Asgard, Thor sought help from Doctor Strange. However, Thor was just too late to save his own father from death. Shortly afterwards, Thor met Hela, the Goddess of Death and his sister. In the wake of his first encounter with Hela, Thor's hammer Mjølnir was destroyed and he was banished to Sakaar, where he was forced to compete in the Contest of Champions. After a reunion and subsequent fight with Hulk, the pair allied with the rogue Valkyrie in order to save Asgard and escape Sakaar. After battling with Hela and losing an eye to her, Thor then had Loki unleash Ragnarök and destroy Asgard, killing Hela in the process, although he escaped with the remaining Asgardians. Declaring that Asgard was all its people and not a place, Thor accepted his newfound position as king and decided to relocate the Asgardians on Earth.

As they were en route to Earth, their ship was attacked by Thanos and the Black Order, who sought the Tesseract which Loki took from Asgard's vault at the last moment. Thor witnessed Thanos take the stone and murder his brother before he was flung from the ship and left for dead. He was rescued by the Guardians of the Galaxy and had teamed up with Rocket Raccoon and Groot to travel to Nidavellir. With the help of Eitri, Thor crafted Stormbreaker and aided the nation of Wakanda and the Avengers in defeating the Outriders and confronting Thanos. However, Thor squandered his chance to kill Thanos with his new weapon and Thanos activated the completed Infinity Gauntlet and erased half the universe's population from existence before he escaped. After the Avengers were joined by Captain Marvel, the team traveled to the Garden, where Thor and the Avengers ambushed and interrogated Thanos, discovering that the Titan destroyed the Stones, ensuring that a reversal of his actions was now impossible. Enraged, Thor beheaded Thanos using Stormbreaker and left the planet.

Following Thanos' death, Thor left the Avengers and relocated to Tønsberg, Norway, where he and the surviving Asgardians resettled, renaming the town New Asgard. Five years later, Hulk and Rocket traveled to New Asgard to convince the now-overweight and depressed Thor to rejoin the team after discovering how to travel through time. Thor joined the Avengers on their Time Heist and participated in the Battle of Earth, where he fought an alternate timeline Thanos alongside Captain America and Iron Man, the latter sacrificing his life to eliminate Thanos and his armies. After attending Stark's funeral, Thor decided to join the Guardians of the Galaxy, proclaiming Valkyrie to succeed him as king of the Asgardians.

Biography
Early Life
Youth with Loki
Thor had an idyllic childhood, brought up in Asgard as the most treasured son of Odin and his wife Frigga. His best friend and playmate was his adopted brother Loki, and though the brothers were both rivals for their father's throne, they still remained close companions. Loki was taught magic by their mother, while Thor was taught how to be a warrior by their father. During his youth, Thor fostered a strong desire to join the Valkyrie until he learned they were an elite group of female-only soldiers.

Loki's Snake and Frog Tricks
As Thor and Loki grew up together, Loki developed a taste for mischief and magic, as he had been taught by Frigga. Thor was once tricked by his brother when Loki transformed himself into a snake, knowing that Thor loved snakes. Upon picking up the snake, Thor was surprised as Loki turned back to himself and stabbed his brother, although Thor survived.

In another instance, Loki turned Thor into a frog for a brief time. After transforming Thor, Loki sat on the throne of Asgard and pretended to take over the crown. Then Frog Thor appeared and Loki was pummeled by him. On another ocassion, Thor was frozen by Loki with the Casket of Ancient Winters.

Raised to be King
Thor is given a lesson by his father Odin
Brought up within the warrior culture of the Asgardians, Thor valued strength, courage, and loyalty above all else. He had desired to be exactly like his own father, Odin, the war hero who had defeated Laufey during the Asgard-Jotunheim War and brought peace across all the Nine Realms. To help him become a warrior, Thor received the powerful hammer, Mjølnir to be his companion when he became king, helping him to focus his ability to control thunder.

Thor and Loki are given advice from Odin
Thor often remarked on the monsters, such as the Frost Giants, he would slay and the wars he would win once he was king, although Odin attempted to teach him to value peace above war while dealing with all of their enemies. As both Thor and Loki insisted that they would both be ready to become King of Asgard, Odin noted that only one of them would be able to take the throne. Over the years, Thor was groomed by Odin to become King, leaving Loki jealous.

Becoming Nordic Legend
Thor and Loki, along with Odin, visited Earth. The Asgardians taught the Norse people their language and culture and displayed their abilities; this caused the Norse people to believe the Asgardians to be deities, and bestowed upon Thor the moniker "God of Thunder." They also named a day of the week after him, "Thor's Day," which became Thursday.

Warrior
Thor becomes a powerful Asgardian warrior
Thor proved himself a great warrior, often leading his own band of warriors into battle, which included Sif, Loki, as well as the Warriors Three on adventures which he would describe as being glorious. However, he was also known to be reckless when Loki jokingly reminded him that he would be dead had he not used a smoke veil to allow them to escape during one battle. Thor had also defeated Imir, a rogue Asgardian who threatened to take control of Asgard and taken several of the Dwarven smiths captives.

Thor alongside the rest of the royal family
While Imir managed to get the upper hand on Thor, he was eventually defeated when Thor electrocuted him with Mjølnir, giving Thor yet another grand victory to his name which also increasing his already large ego. With several great victories to his name, Thor and all the rest of the Asgardian Royal Family continued to rule over Asgard and all the Nine Realms, ensuring the peace was kept, despite Thor still longing for more battles and wars to satisfy his warrior nature.

Winning a Bet
In November 1971, Thor won a bet with Loki, prompting the latter to acquire $200,000 from Earth after hijacking  Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305 with a bomb threat under the pseudonym D.B. Cooper.

Loki's Schemes
Delayed Coronation
Thor speaks to Loki before the ceremony
Thor was eventually announced to be the next ruler of Asgard by the current King Odin, as he was about to finally enter the Odinsleep after putting it off for so long. While preparing for the ceremony, Thor spoke with Loki as they joked about if Thor was nervous or not, which he insisted he was not before Loki mocked his Winged Helmet. Loki, however, assured Thor that he was still proud of his brother.

Thor enjoys the cheers at his coronation
Thor appeared at the ceremony, walking throughout the crowds of cheering Asgardians and enjoying every moment of the event. Upon arriving before the throne, Thor removed his helmet and nodded to his friends, Lady Sif and the Warriors Three while winking towards his mother Frigga and Loki. Odin then stood up and ordered silence in the great hall by hitting Gungnir on the ground as Thor underwent the passage of finally becoming king of Asgard from Odin.

Thor prepares to become king of Asgard
King Odin gave a speech in which he acknowledged Thor to be his firstborn, noting how he was entrusted with the mighty Mjølnir which would be his companion as the king. Odin then had Thor swear to set aside all selfish ambition to protect all the Nine Realms as well as Asgard, which Thor swore to. As Odin was about to name Thor king, he sensed that the Frost Giants had sneaked into Asgard and into his vault to steal the Casket of Ancient Winters from them.

Thor argues with Odin over going to war
Odin, Thor, and Loki went to the vault to find the Frost Giants had already been slain by the Destroyer. Seeing how close they had come to steal the artifacts, the enraged Thor declared that they must go to Jotunheim and show their strength, but Odin refused to go to war with Laufey again. Thor insisted that as king of Asgard, he would lead their army as Odin had done before him. Odin reminded him that he was not king yet and ordered him not to attack.

Recruiting the Warriors Three
Thor vents his anger by throwing over tables
Having rejected from taking his own place as Asgard's newest king due to the attacks of the Frost Giants, Thor was completely enraged, believing that his day of triumph had been ruined. Within their dining hall, the utterly furious Thor began throwing tables around in anger, venting his rage on the food prepared for the celebrations for him being crowned king.

Thor is offered some poor advice from Loki
While Thor went to sit alone and consider the injustice that had been put upon him, Loki joined him and comforted him over not becoming the King of Asgard as he had hoped before convincing him then that he was right in his idea and they must go to Jotunheim to confront King Laufey for the crimes his people had committed against them, despite denying any of this was indeed his own plan, noting it would require them having to defy Odin's direct commands.

Thor recruits Lady Sif and the Warriors Three
As they were talking, Lady Sif and the Warriors Three arrived, with Volstagg being horrified at finding the now overturned dinner table. Thor announced they were going to Jotunheim and that he would lead them to victory. The group was fearful of the idea, noting that the Frost Giants were not easy foes to overcome. Although they were initially skeptical over the risks, Thor reminded them of their past victories and soon changed their minds about the attack.

Thor prepares to use the Bifrost Bridge
The group traveled towards the Bifrost Bridge and sought Heimdall's permission for passage to Jotunheim. Ignoring Loki's attempts to talk his way past him, Heimdall did still grant Thor's request, noting that throughout all his years as guardian this was the first time an enemy had gotten past his watch. Heimdall then sent them to Jotunheim, but warned that if they all got into trouble, they would not be granted entrance back home and would all be left to die there.

Attack on Jotunheim
Thor and Loki negotiate with King Laufey
Once they arrived at Jotunheim, Thor led the Warriors Three through the destroyed realm toward Laufey's chambers where he warned them to leave while he still allowed them to, although Thor continued to demand to know how his people had gotten into Odin's Vault to steal the Casket of Ancient Winters. One of the Frost Giants approached Thor before Loki led him away, noting that they were outnumbered by their enemies and it would be unwise to begin a conflict, much to Thor's great annoyance. Thor remained silent as he walked away from Laufey until a Frost Giant called Thor a princess.

Thor battles all the Frost Giants in Jotunheim
Thor unleashed his anger and with the mighty power of Mjølnir hit the Frost Giant so hard he flew across the wasteland. Having begun the skirmish, the warriors then bravely joined Thor and battled the Frost Giants. Thor took great pleasure in fighting all his enemies, throwing Mjølnir at Hailstrum and others while demanding more of a challenge. While Thor was enjoying himself, Fandral was struck by a Frost Giant and warned Thor to pull back while they had some chance.

Thor unleashes all of Mjølnir's power
Thor told them to leave while he battled the Frost Giants alone. As his friends left and reached the Bifrost Bridge, Thor unleashed the full power of Mjølnir and erupted the ground around him killing hundreds of the Frost Giants, before flying at full speed to kill the Frost Beast that was chasing the Asgardians. Laufey and his whole army then surrounded Thor and his friends, who were driven back to the edge of a cliff, seemingly defenseless against the army.

Thor and his friends are rescued by King Odin
Before they attacked, Odin then arrived while riding Sleipnir. Thor attempted to convince his father to join him in the battle only to be told to remain silent. Odin then warned King Laufey by telling him to preserve the peace and not respond to the actions of a boy. Laufey said that war had now already begun between them, and Odin then transported himself and the other Asgardians back home, furious at Thor for his actions and the consequences.

Banished to Earth
Thor arguing with King Odin
Back in the Bifrost Bridge, King Odin ordered the Warriors Three to take the seriously wounded Fandral to the Healing Room. Odin then chastised Thor for his reckless actions saying that he would sacrifice the lives of innocent people to go to war against the Frost Giants and that they were not the actions of a King, but a warrior. Thor told Odin he was an old man and a fool, arguing that the Nine Realms were in danger as Odin was still afraid to act against their enemies, with Thor making it clear that he wanted Laufey to fear him as much as he had once feared Odin.

Thor is banished without any of his powers
Acknowledging that Thor had proven himself to be unworthy to be king, Odin confessed that he was a fool to have ever thought Thor was ready to rule Asgard, ignoring Loki when he tried to protest to protect his brother. While Thor stood horrified, Odin then took Mjølnir from Thor and removed his powers before using the Bifrost to banish Thor to Earth without his strength, as a punishment for being proven unworthy by betraying Asgard and his loved one by his actions.

Thor finds himself trapped on Midgard
Thor was then sent through the Bifrost Bridge arriving onto Earth in a wormhole, which was being studied by Doctor Jane Foster as well as Doctor Erik Selvig and their understudy Darcy Lewis. Thor stood only to be knocked over by the truck they were driving, much to the horror of the scientists who immediately ran to his aid. Thor quickly awoke and began shouting to Heimdall to reopen the Bifrost and return him and then demanded to know which of all of the Nine Realms he was currently in, questioning if it was either Alfheim or Nornheim to which Lewis explained that this was New Mexico, much to Thor's confusion as he continued calling to Mjølnir and Heimdall to take him home.

Thor is threatened by Darcy Lewis' taser
The humans had soon come to believe Thor to be crazy and as Lewis had threatened Thor with a taser, he was utterly disgusted at her actions, claiming it to be an insult for an Asgardian warrior like himself to be threatened by such a puny weapon. However, Thor was unaware of his new weaknesses as Lewis then tasered him knocking him unconscious. Thor was then put inside of Selvig's truck and driven into Puente Antiguo to receive medical attention.

Treated in Hospital
Thor reacts to doctors taking away his blood
Thor awoke in Puente Antiguo County Hospital with a man over him saying he that was about to take some blood. Unaware of his surroundings and having seemingly forgotten that he no longer had his Asgardian strength, Thor attacked the hospital staff and security guards, furious that they had dared to attack him by attempting to take his blood. Taking on dozens of the staff members, Thor yelled that they were no match for the son of Odin before being sedated by the hospital staff.

Thor finds himself tied down to a hospital bed
Eventually, Thor awoke yet again to find himself strapped down to a bed. He attempted to rip the restraints off, but to his horror, he found that he was unable to remove all of the ties that had been made by mere Humans. Determined to get away, Thor eventually managed to squeeze his own hands out of their restraints and headed towards the nearest exit, avoiding the hospital staff members who were still recovering from his earlier outburst of rage and violence.

Thor is hit by Jane Foster's car once again
Having gotten out of the hospital, Thor then began to make his way outside to begin searching for Mjølnir and a way home to Asgard before being hit again by a car, again driven by Jane Foster, who had apologized for running him over for a second time and promised that it was not something she was doing on purpose. To try and make it up to Thor, the scientists then took him back to their own Wormhole Research Center to discuss all their research on the subject.

Misunderstandings
Thor is given new clothes from Jane Foster
Thor was taken back to Jane Foster's science base where he was given the clothes from her ex-boyfriend, Donald Blake, noticing the name tag that still remained on the shirt. Still remaining remarkably arrogant in his new surroundings upon Midgard, Thor then announced to the bemused group of scientists that he was now hungry and they all then took him to Isabela's Diner to get him some pancakes and coffee.

Thor drinks some coffee for the first time
To the amusement of Darcy Lewis, Thor ate enormous amounts of food astonishing the three before smashing his own cup on the floor demanding another drink. Foster told him that if he wanted another, he should ask nicely rather than breaking things while Lewis had him pose for a picture for Facebook. Thor then overheard Pete and Jake talking about a "satellite" that had just crashed to Earth. Thor soon realized it was Mjølnir and requested directions from the pair.

Thor goes a mission to reclaim Mjølnir
Thor then departed the diner with all the scientists closely behind him, questioning where he was going. Thor told them he would reclaim Mjølnir from S.H.I.E.L.D. and give them the answers that they sought about the Bifrost Bridge. Although Foster was eager to learn more, Erik Selvig convinced her not to follow as he feared for Thor's mental state. Thor then said goodbye to Foster, Lewis, and Selvig and began to walk towards Mjølnir's location.

Thor demands a horse inside a pet store
Realizing as a mortal the walk was too far, Thor went to the local pet store and demanded a horse. The owner said that they did not have horses only cats, dogs, and other house animals to which Thor asked for one large enough to ride; instead, all he received was a very confused look from the shop worker. He left unsatisfied only to see Jane Foster again who offered him a ride to the crash site in her car, to which Thor happily accepted without any hesitation.

Unworthy of Power
Thor hints at his past life to Jane Foster
Thor was told by Jane Foster that S.H.I.E.L.D. had stolen all of her research on the Bifrost Bridge. Thor promised to tell her everything she wanted to know about the wormholes when he reclaimed what was his, although Foster only commented that she still thought Thor was a strange character and noted that she really hoped he was not crazy, which greatly amused Thor as they drove.

Thor promises to get Jane Foster's research
They soon arrived at the crash site to find it covered by a makeshift research facility. As they looked over the facility, Thor gave Foster his jacket as he correctly predicted it would begin to rain momentarily while telling her to remain hidden while he collected what was theirs. When Foster questioned how he planned to walk out with their equipment, Thor informed her that he intended to fly out, which did not help Foster's confidence at all as Thor moved forward.

Thor breaks into the S.H.I.E.L.D. compound
Thor entered and took down agents Jackson and Delancey before being noticed and began making his way towards Mjølnir which was being studied in the middle of the base by S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists. However, Jasper Sitwell eventually raised the alarm when the agents failed to call in. Thor then began taking down guard after guard, even without any of his former Asgardian strength all his fighting skills still outmatched many of the Agents who challenged him.

Thor takes out multiple S.H.I.E.L.D. agents
As Thor approached Mjølnir having defeated almost all the agents, he was confronted by a particularly big guard whom Thor noted was big but he had fought bigger, thinking of his fights against the Frost Giants. Thor battled the agent who was ultimately defeated outside as Thor knocked him out as they both fought in the mud. Thor was unaware that the entire time agent Clint Barton was taking aim and preparing to shoot him with an arrow if ordered.

Thor tries and fails to finally reclaim Mjølnir
Finally, at Mjølnir, Thor rejoiced before gripping his mighty hammer, but could not lift it; using all of his mortal strength, he still could not lift it. Knowing his father Odin had taken his powers away from him as a result of the Attack on Jotunheim, Thor yelled out at the heavens and fell to his knees. Defeated, Thor offered no resistance while Phil Coulson sent his men to apprehend him, telling Barton to also stand down. As the guards arrested him, Thor noticed a small Asgardian symbol appear on Mjølnir, and became heartbroken that he may never see his home or family again while he was then taken away for questioning under the orders of Agent Coulson.

Learning Humility
Captured by S.H.I.E.L.D.
Thor is questioned by Agent Phil Coulson
Thor was taken for questioning by Phil Coulson but did not respond to any questions, Coulson was convinced he must be special forces due to his remarkable fighting skills which had allowed him to defeat all of Coulson's men, questioning if he was trained for the United States Armed Forces while in Afghanistan or Chechnya. Thor remained silent throughout the interrogation and refused to answer Coulson's questions; however, the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent informed him that sooner or later, they would find out what they wanted to know, noting their organization was good at that.

Thor is then visited by his brother Loki
When Coulson had left for a moment, Loki then arrived in front of him. Thor asked about Jotunheim and demanded to speak to their father; however, Loki informed him that Odin was dead due to the strain of everything that had happened and that in Thor's absence, Loki had been made King of Asgard. When Thor asked if he could go home, Loki explained that Thor must remain on the Earth to maintain peace with King Laufey and the Frost Giants who wanted war.

Thor is informed by Loki that Odin is dead
Although Thor tried to argue that perhaps they could find a way, Loki told him that their mother Frigga had forbidden his return. Although he was utterly heartbroken, Thor agreed to the arrangement and said goodbye to his brother, thanking him for coming to him and informing him of their father's death. Coulson then returned to the room to find Thor saying goodbye to thin air. Thor then remained sat down on the chair and considered his future while still trapped on Earth.

Bonding with Jane Foster
Thor is rescued by Doctor Erik Selvig
While Thor was being interrogated, Jasper Sitwell arrived and then informed Phil Coulson that Thor had a visitor. Thor then learned the visitor was Erik Selvig, who had arrived and told the S.H.I.E.L.D. that Thor was Doctor Donald Blake, their colleague who was drunk and very upset about the loss of their equipment. Coulson allowed Thor to leave so he could follow them, with Thor stealing a notebook on his way out.

Thor has a drink with Erik Selvig
Despite being ordered not to, Thor and Selvig then went for a drink together where Thor noted that for the first time in his life he had no idea what his future held, telling Selvig that he now wished he had listened to his father's lessons. Selvig told Thor that all he wanted to ensure was that Jane Foster always remained safe, to which Thor insisted he wished her no harm, so Selvig bought him another drink and asked him to leave New Mexico in the morning.

Thor brings Erik Selvig to Jane Foster
He agreed and they share another drink. After a few more drinks, Selvig smashed his glass on the ground and demanded another, as Thor had done with his coffee the day before. Seeing Selvig had begun accepting him, Thor laughed and joined him in demanding more alcohol. All Thor's drinking prowess led to them getting into a bar brawl while walking through the streets singing merry songs until Thor decided Selvig had enjoyed himself enough.

Thor spends time with Jane Foster
With Selvig too drunk to move, Thor brought him to Jane's camper to sleep off the alcohol; though Selvig still didn't believe Thor was the God of Thunder, they both now had a good friendship, as Selvig had then drunkenly claimed that Thor should still be the God of Thunder regardless. Thor and Foster went to the roof of the Research Center and gazed at the stars together. She told Thor about herself, noting how she would often sit on the roof to think or get away from all the annoyances of Darcy Lewis while returned her notebook which he had retaken from S.H.I.E.L.D. for her, much to Foster's delight as she no longer had to restart all of her original work from nothing.

Thor considering his new life trapped on Earth
To reassure Foster about continuing her work, Thor began to tell her all about the Nine Realms and Yggdrasil, the World Tree; Thor also explained that all her theories were correct and then tried to help her understand them better. When she fell asleep, Thor ensured that she was warm before watching over her as she slept before looking up to the stars and considering his past and future now he lived among the humans down on Earth, away from his friends and family.

Reunion with Warriors
Thor serves breakfast to all his new friends
The next day, Thor's attitude had taken a change for the better and he had personally made breakfast for his new friends with Jane Foster. During their breakfast together, Thor requested that they allow him to have one of the mugs, which they had accepted. Thor then departed and went straight to Isabela's Diner where he found Isabela Alvarez and gave her the mug to replace the one he broke.

Thor is visited by Sif and the Warriors Three
Thor listened as Erik Selvig and Foster discussed how they planned on presenting their theories to higher-ups without any hard evidence, when they were interrupted by the Warriors Three and Sif who had arrived on Earth and were all delighted to see their dear friend again. Amazed, Thor then immediately ran over to his friends and embraced them, while Foster, Selvig and Lewis looked on in utter amazement as their arrival seemingly confirmed that Thor was telling the truth.

Thor learns of Loki's betrayal and many lies
Thor rejoiced to see them all but told them that they should not have come to collect him, noting that Odin was dead because of him and he must now remain of Earth to ensure the peace with Jotunheim. However, they all then informed him that Odin was alive and that Loki was King and had shown the Frost Giants the way into Asgard. As they were all talking, they saw another Wormhole in the distance and realized Loki had sent his own forces after them.

Battle of Puente Antiguo
Thor explains he cannot fight with his friends
The group saw that the Destroyer had arrived in New Mexico having been sent by Loki to destroy them all. While Fandral was excited by the idea of Thor joining them into the battle, Thor made it clear that he was now only human, promising to get all the innocent people to safety. Thor and his friends evacuated the town as the Warriors Three and Lady Sif formulated their plan to stop the Destroyer.

Thor convinces Lady Sif to save herself
The Destroyer began attacking the town, destroying everything in its path and knocked back the Warriors Three before being seemingly stopped by Sif's Sword. The Destroyer simply rearranged its body to face Sif and nearly killed her. With this, the Destroyer seemed unstoppable as he continued its firing beams of energy and massive explosions, almost killing Volstagg. Thor went to Sif's aid and convinced her to escape and live another day.

Thor bravely faces off against the Destroyer
With the Warriors Three all exhausted and nearly defeated from the battle, Thor told them to fall back and reassured them all that he had a plan. While Hogun carried Volstagg to safety, Thor approached the Destroyer and spoke to Loki through it, telling him that he was sorry for whatever he had done to wrong him. Thor pleaded to Loki that he could not allow him to kill all of the innocent people of the town and instead to take his life to protect them all from harm.

Thor sacrifices himself to save innocent lives
Loki seemingly relented as the Destroyer turned and headed back to where it came from; however, just as Thor let out a sigh of relief, Loki used the Destroyer to strike Thor across the face and sent him flying backward. With his bones shattered by the force of the blow, Thor laid on his back dying while Jane Foster came to his aid and sat with him. While she tried to help him, Thor expressed his joy that he had saved her before closing his eyes and dying from his wounds.

Return to Strength
Thor finally regains his Asgardian powers
While all his friends mourned the death of the God of Thunder, the Destroyer turned around and made its leave. However, before it could get far, Mjølnir sensed Thor's action of self-sacrifice and flew from the S.H.I.E.L.D. Crater Investigation Site and straight into Thor's hand, resurrecting him and finally returning his own powers with the burst of lightning, having deemed him worthy due to his self-sacrifice. Thor then stood with the mighty hammer in his full armor again.

Thor successfully defeats the Destroyer
Thor then threw Mjølnir at the Destroyer, knocking it off its feet before he created a tornado around the Destroyer and engaged it, forcibly lifting it high in the air while using Mjølnir to block its deadly beams of energy. Once the Destroyer was at a safe height, Thor flew towards its energy beam, deflecting its power back into its own head causing it to implode and thus disabling it, causing the Destroyer to crash land as Thor walked away from the battle victoriously.

Thor speaks with Agent Phil Coulson
While Jane Foster and Erik Selvig had marveled at Thor, he was then approached by the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, with Phil Coulson calmly noting that Thor clearly had not been totally honest with him as he reminded him that during their last encounter he had claimed to be a Doctor named Donald Blake. Thor then told Agent Coulson that he must return Foster's research if he wanted his help in the future as they both fought on the same side and for the same goal. Although Coulson and Foster debated if S.H.I.E.L.D. had stolen or borrowed her research, Coulson agreed and told Foster they would allow her to continue her work in Wormhole study and understanding.

Thor says his goodbyes to Jane Foster
Thor then promised to show Foster the Bifrost Bridge and flew her to the Bifrost site. When Thor asked Heimdall for the Bifrost to open so that he could return to Asgard, Heimdall did not respond, due to him having been betrayed by Loki and frozen with the Casket of Ancient Winters. Eventually, Heimdall opened the Bridge and Thor then said goodbye to Foster with a kiss, vowing to return for her. The Warriors Three and Lady Sif arrived and they all returned to Asgard.

Fighting Loki
Thor finally returns home to Asgard
Thor, Sif and the Warriors Three arrived in Asgard and found Heimdall mortally wounded from an attack by Loki. Thor ordered his friends to get Heimdall to the healing room before searching for his brother. He soon arrived in Odin's Chamber to see his mother Frigga with Loki, who had just saved their father from King Laufey, whom he had then killed. Loki was shocked to see his brother as Thor then revealed Loki's true deception and crimes to the horrified Frigga.

Thor attempts to convince Loki to stop
Knowing that his time was limited, Loki sent Thor flying through a wall of the chamber with a shot from Gungnir and headed towards Himinbjorg where he began the process of destroying Jotunheim. Once Thor arrived, he tried to stop Loki's schemes, but failed, Loki said he did it all to be Thor's equal and he vowed to now destroy Jotunheim using the Bifrost Bridge. Thor refused to fight his brother only to be told they were not true brothers.

Thor battles against his own brother, Loki
Thor tried to convince Loki that his actions were madness, but Loki questioned if that was true and called Thor soft, noting he could have destroyed all the Frost Giants with his bare hands. When Loki went on to threaten to kill Jane Foster, the now enraged Thor flew forward and attacked Loki, as the pair exchanged blows with their weapons. Although Thor was clearly the stronger of the two, Loki resorted to his tricks to gain the upper hand during their battle.

Thor is surrounded by Loki's many illusions
Eventually, Thor launched forward at his brother, knocking both of them out of Himinbjorg where Loki seemingly nearly fell off the Rainbow Bridge. However, when Thor attempted to save him, Loki revealed it to be another trick and surrounded Thor with illusions of himself, laughing maniacally. After a gruesome fight, Thor managed to tie Loki down by placing Mjølnir on top of him and went to stop the Bifrost, but saw that it was too far gone to be stopped now.

Thor prepares to destroy the Rainbow Bridge
Despite having no other choices, Thor did not want to destroy the Rainbow Bridge because then he could not return to Earth to see Jane Foster ever again, but for the sake of the Nine Realms, Thor called Mjølnir to him and began destroying the Rainbow Bridge. Loki screamed at him to make him stop, attempting to stab him in the back, but Thor manages to destroy the bridge, causing the energy of the Bifrost to explode and create a wormhole.

Thor watches Loki fall through a black hole
The massive blast from the Bifrost's destruction launched the fighting brothers into the air where they almost fell into the abyss themselves. However, both Thor and Loki were then caught by Odin who had awakened from the Odinsleep. Desperate to prove himself worthy in his father's eyes, Loki revealed he did it all for him: However, Odin still rejected him. Thor watched on helplessly as Loki let go and allowed himself to fall into the abyss, falling into the wormhole.
