Doctor Jane Foster is one of the world's leading astrophysicists, the world's foremost astronomer, the creator of the Foster Theory, as well as one of the premiere experts on Asgard. She found Thor after he was banished from Asgard and fell to Earth while she and her team were in New Mexico studying astronomical anomalies. She helped him in his mission to return to Asgard, eventually falling in love with him along the way. They were separated due to the temporary destruction of the Rainbow Bridge. During Loki's assault on Earth, S.H.I.E.L.D. kept her out of harms way by transferring her to a remote observatory where Loki could not find her.

She found out of Thor's return through the footage of the Battle of New York; this left Foster disappointed and angry that Thor didn't attempt contacting her. During the Convergence, she became host to the Aether and helped Thor defeat Malekith during the Battle of Greenwich. Once free of the Aether, Foster returned to work and Thor had decided to remain on Earth with her. Due to her work studying of the Convergence, Foster was being considered for the Noble Prize in astrophysics. Following the Ultron Offensive, Foster ended her relationship with Thor.

In 2018, Foster was amongst the victims who died when Thanos wiped out half the life in the universe with the Infinity Stones. Five years later, the Avengers were successful in reversing the effects of the Snap, bringing back everyone who died, including Foster.

When Thor and Rocket Raccoon traveled back to an alternate 2013 to steal the Reality Stone, this version of Foster was resting on Asgard. Rocket snuck into her room and extracted the stone from Foster's body, causing her to alert the Einherjar of his presence. Moments later, Captain America arrived in the alternate 2013, returning the Reality Stone.

Biography
Early Life
Science Career
Jane Foster was a student at Culver University, where her father and Erik Selvig worked together. She later graduated and became an astronomer, dedicating her life to her research, where she built most of her equipment herself. Foster also briefly dated M.D. Donald Blake, but eventually broke up with him. When looking back at him, Foster would note that while Blake was a great doctor, he sucked at being a boyfriend.

Sometime after her graduation from Culver University, Foster began studying a mysterious weather event that she believed was linked to an Einstein-Rosen Bridge. Accompanied by Selvig and their intern Darcy Lewis, Foster traveled to the source of the anomalies, which was out in the desert surrounding Puente Antiguo, New Mexico.

Life-Changing Encounter
Meeting Thor
Foster watches for the weather event
At the end of their first week of research, Foster became certain that another weather event would occur, due to the predictability of the previous seventeen instances. Being sure of her research, Foster, Erik Selvig and Darcy Lewis drove out to the desert in their van one night to witness the event.

Foster witnesses a massive weather event
When nothing happened, Selvig attempted to convince Foster to give up her search, believing it to be just chasing storms, not connected to astronomy. However, Foster was determined that there was a connection in her research, pleading Selvig to just be patient with it. Suddenly, Lewis alerted the two to something unknown forming in the sky, much to their confusion and amazement.

Foster checks on Thor after hitting him
With her research proven to have been correct, Foster told Lewis to drive towards the occurrence so she could study and record it. As they got closer, a powerful vortex formed in front of them, so Lewis steered away from it, only for Foster to force them towards it. However, when they entered the vortex, they struggled to see anything, causing them to collide with a man who had stumbled out of the dust into their path. 

Foster examines markings in the desert
The occurrence then ended, with the vortex disappearing, so they all got out of the van to check on the man they hit. Foster found the man to still be alive, as he got up and began to speak, although none of them understood what he was saying. Foster then noticed markings in the ground, much to her intrigue, so she started to study them, however Selvig suggested they take the man to the hospital instead. The man announced himself as Thor and started to intimidate them, but was stopped when Lewis tasered him. They then decided to put Thor in their van and take him to a hospital.

Foster checks Thor into the hospital
They delivered Thor to the hospital and signed him in, giving them his name, and then returned to their research base. The next morning, they discussed the events of the previous night, which Foster was now certain was an Einstein-Rosen Bridge. Foster and Selvig reviewed constellations they had discovered which were not from their planet, when Lewis noticed the figure of a man in one of the photographic images captured from the atmospheric event. 

Foster accidentally hits Thor with her van
Foster then believed that figure to have been Thor, so she decided to drive back to the hospital to question him. The three rushed through the hospital, but when they entered Thor's room, they discovered him to be gone. Annoyed that she lost he best piece of evidence for her research, Foster set out to find Thor. However, when she reversed the van, she accidentally hit Thor again. Foster got out of the van and apologized, as she had now knocked him over twice with her van.

Questioning Thor
Foster questions Thor about his arrival
Bringing Thor to the base, they provided him with Donald Blake's clothes, and Foster started to become distracted by Thor as she watched him change. When Thor mentioned that he required food, they took him to Isabela's Diner, where Foster questioned him on how he was inside the vortex. However, Thor didn't take notice of their questions and smashed a mug in request of another drink, causing Foster to tell him not to do that anymore.

Foster learns about Mjølnir
When two men entered the diner talking about a "satellite" that landed in the desert, Foster listened in on the conversation, and asked them about it. When they revealed that the "satellite" could not be moved, Thor asked for directions and then headed off, causing Foster to run after him. Foster asked what he was doing, and Thor informed them that the "satellite" belonged to him and he was going to take it.

Foster and Thor part ways
Thor then offered to tell Foster everything she wanted to know about him if she helped him retrieve Mjølnir. Concerned, Erik Selvig spoke to Foster, who was willing to help Thor to assist her own research, and convinced her not to, as he believed Thor was dangerous. Foster then told Thor she couldn't help him, so he kissed her hand, which awkwardly flattered her, and they parted ways. Although, Foster couldn't help but still be infatuated with Thor.

Encountering S.H.I.E.L.D.
Foster finds S.H.I.E.L.D. taking her research
When they returned to the base, they discovered S.H.I.E.L.D. agents confiscating their equipment and research. Foster was angry at the agents sudden intrusion into their base, but Erik Selvig tried to calm her down, due to knowing how serious the actual situation was.

Foster is left with nothing
However, due to her life's work being taken from her, Foster tried to stop them, but Phil Coulson told her they needed to take all of her possessions, and attempted to compensate her. Despite her pleas, all of Foster's belongings, including her research that was on the verge of an extraordinary discovery, were taken.

Foster discuss what they should do next
S.H.I.E.L.D. then left the base, so they then sat on the roof of the building, commiserating the loss of their property, as Selvig informed them of who the people that they encountered were. Selvig then suggested contacting a colleague of his who could possibly help with their situation.

Search for Mjølnir
Foster notices Thor wandering in New Mexico
Foster then drove Erik Selvig to the library to e-mail his colleague, and as she waited in the van, she noticed Thor heading into a pet store.

Foster and Thor bond as they drive to the site
Foster drove up to him and offered him a lift, deciding to help him, as she wanted to get her research back. The two then drove down to the crater site, determined to retrieve their possessions, which Foster was nervous about doing. During the drive, Foster bonded with Thor, while still not being sure of who he was.

Foster doubts Thor's chances of success
When the arrived at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Crater Investigation Site, Foster observed the area, realizing that there was no satellite crash, but something bigger. Thor then gave Foster his jacket, knowing it was going to rain, and promised to return her belongings after retrieving Mjølnir. However, Foster doubted Thor's chances of success, but he still heading to the site.

Foster witnesses Thor fail to lift Mjølnir
Foster then watched as Thor made his way through the site, knocking out many agents along the way. When an alarm went off, Foster hid from detection and called Selvig, telling him she went with Thor and to come find her if she didn't return. When Thor found Mjølnir, Foster watched as he tried to lift it but failed. When Thor was arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D., Foster then fled the site and returned to the base, but, she was spotted by Clint Barton.

Foster convinces Erik Selvig to help Thor
When Foster returned, she tried to convince Selvig to help free Thor, now believing his story, but Selvig didn't want to, still trying to protect her from him. When Darcy Lewis showed Foster a book on Norse mythology, featuring Mjølnir, she used what Selvig told her about uncovering every possibility to persuade him, but Selvig didn't mean Magic, but science. However, Foster reasoned that magic was just science they didn't understand, and she was able to enlist Selvig's help.

Bonding with Thor
Foster is greeted by Thor in her camper
While Erik Selvig went to retrieve Thor, Foster returned to her camper, where she read more of the book Selvig had found. Later that night, Thor arrived at the camper with a drunk Selvig over his shoulder, so Foster had him put Selvig on her bed. Feeling embarrassed by her living situation in front of Thor, as she never has guests, she asked if they could go outside.

Foster learns more about Thor
The two then sat on the roof of her base, where Foster would always go to think or get away from all the annoyances. Foster then expressed her relief that Thor was safe after his encounter with S.H.I.E.L.D., and he thanked her for her generosity despite the way he had behaved recently. Thor then gave Foster her notebook, which she was delighted by, no longer having to start her research from scratch now. However, Foster was saddened by the thought that S.H.I.E.L.D. would do everything in their power to stop her research from ever being published, but Thor urged her to continue, knowing that she was right.

Foster developing strong feelings for Thor
Thor explained to Foster that where he is from, Asgard, Magic and science are the same thing, while also drawing and teaching her of the Nine Realms and Yggdrasil, the World Tree. Foster found herself deeply interested in what Thor was saying, as well as developing strong feelings for him too. Later, Foster fell asleep under the stars with Thor by her side.

Foster informs Erik Selvig of the Nine Realms
Thor, who believed he was banished from Asgard, decided to embrace living on Earth with Foster, as the two had begun to develop romantic feelings for each other. The next morning, Foster and Thor made breakfast for Selvig and Darcy Lewis, who she told what she had learned from Thor the previous night, hoping to publish it to the scientific community. But, Selvig informed her that it was only ever going to be a theory without any evidence. 

Foster sees Sif and the Warriors Three arrive
At that moment, four Asgardians appeared at the base, much to the Humans shock and awe. They entered the base and introduced themselves as Lady Sif and the Warriors Three, and Foster watched as Thor conversed with them about his supposed exile, only to discover that his father was still alive, and that he had been lied to by his brother.

The Destroyer Attacks
Foster decides to stay and help Thor evacuate
When another vortex formed out in the desert, they all went outside to look at it, where Thor realized that the Destroyer had been sent down, causing him to warn Foster to leave. Thor told them that he would stay to help the people get to safety, so Foster decided to stay as well, not wanting to leave Thor, as well as help out.

Foster watches Thor confront the Destroyer
After evacuating everyone in the area, Foster watched as Sif and the Warriors Three battled the Destroyer. When the Destroyer quickly overpowered the Asgardians, Thor ordered to them run away before they were caught in the destruction. As they went to leave, Foster noticed Thor staying behind to confront the Destroyer, so she stopped, confused on what he was doing.

Foster cries over Thor's dead body
Foster watched as Thor attempted to apologisze to his brother, but it did not work, and the Destroyer strikes Thor, sending him flying back. Foster quickly ran to Thor's side to check on him, and he told her that she was now safe as he died from his injury, to the sadness of Foster. As Foster wept over Thor's body, Mjølnir began to launch from the desert and fly towards them, so Erik Selvig grabbed her and got her to safety.

Foster witnesses Thor regain his powers
When Mjølnir arrived, it helped revive Thor, who caught the hammer, allowing him to regain his full powers and reveal his true self, much to Foster's amazement as she witnessed everything he had told her to be true. Foster continued to watch as Thor battled the Destroyer in the sky, ultimately defeating it, saving them from the danger that Loki had unleashed.

Left Behind
Foster and Thor speak with Phil Coulson
Thor then returned to his friends, with Foster commenting on his new armor he was wearing, which she liked. Thor then announced that he needed to confront Loki, but were stopped when S.H.I.E.L.D. arrived. Thor confronted Phil Coulson, telling him to return the items he took from Foster, which he complied with, wanting her to continue her research.

Foster passionately kisses Thor goodbye
Thor then invited Foster to accompany him to see the Bifrost Bridge, which she accepted, so he held her tight and flew them out to the desert. When they arrived at the Bifrost site, Thor discovered Heimdall not responding. After some delay, the Bifrost then opened and Thor told Foster that he needed to return to Asgard to stop Loki, but he would return for her after. Foster then passionately kissed Thor goodbye, accepting his promise.

Foster realizes that Thor is not returning
Thor and the other Asgardians then departed from Earth and Foster stayed at the site with Erik Selvig and Darcy Lewis to wait for him. While they waited, they noticed where the Bifrost opened to begin producing dark lighting clouds, much to their concern. After some time, they then saw the Bifrost opening completely disappear before them, saddening Foster as she felt that Thor had abandoned her. They then decided to leave, accepting that Thor was not returning.

Away from Thor
Working with S.H.I.E.L.D.
Foster decides to search for Thor
After Thor's departure, Foster entered a partnership with S.H.I.E.L.D., providing them the information Thor shared with her regarding the Nine Realms, making her something of an expert adviser regarding Asgardian cosmology. With S.H.I.E.L.D.'s resources, Foster worked extensively in her attempts to create an artificial wormhole with hopes of reuniting with Thor in Asgard. She nearly succeeded after months of work, but yet again, Foster eventually failed. Darcy Lewis tried to convince her to wait, citing that Thor had promised her he would return for her, but Foster was worried he would not.

Chitauri Invasion
Foster is moved to a research base in Tromsø
In 2012, Thor's brother Loki made an alliance with the Chitauri and declared war on humanity. When Erik Selvig was mind controlled by Loki, Foster and Darcy Lewis were immediately moved to an observatory in Tromsø by S.H.I.E.L.D. for their own protection. During this time, Thor was transported back to Earth to stop his brother; Foster had no immediate knowledge of his return.

Resignation
While in Tromsø, Foster was left in the dark regarding her sudden and immediate transfer, and became frustrated when she was not given an explanation. During an attempt to confront one of the scientists, Darcy Lewis showed her live footage of Thor in Manhattan fighting the Chitauri in the Battle of New York.

Foster and Lewis flew to New York City and reunited with Erik Selvig, who was visibly shaken after being brainwashed by Loki. Foster asked Selvig about Thor's whereabouts and was downtrodden to learn that he had already returned to Asgard. Despite comfort from Lewis, Foster was upset that while she had spent a year trying to create a wormhole in order to reunite with him, Thor had found a way to return to Earth and yet chose not to reunite with her or even leave her a message, prompting her to resign from S.H.I.E.L.D. and move on with her life.

Moving to London
A year later, Foster received a call from Erik Selvig, who, after spending several months enduring psychiatric care, had traveled to London without her knowledge. Selvig explained to Foster that he had discovered a series of bizarre anomalies in London, and needed her to come to London and meet with him. Foster traveled to London, accompanied by Darcy Lewis, but Selvig was nowhere to be found.

Foster moved into her mother's house, which she and Lewis operated out of to conduct their research, which Foster had personally given up on. Despite deciding to move on from Thor, Foster found herself struggling to move on from him, spending most of her days in her mother's house, moping around in her pyjamas, hardly showering.

The Convergence
Interrupted Date
Foster on her date with Richard Madison
Some time later, Foster would be asked out on a date by Richard Madison, which she accepted to try and help get over Thor. However, when they went to a restaurant, Foster spent most of the date hiding behind her menu, still finding it hard to move on.

Foster talks about her previous relationship
Madison then initiated a conversation, asking Foster what her story was, suspecting it had something to do with another man. Foster alluded to Thor, informing Madison that he was away. Madison then informed Foster of a previous relationship, where his girlfriend cheated on him while in New York. 

Foster's date is interrupted by Darcy Lewis
Suddenly, Darcy Lewis showed up and interrupted their date, informing Foster that the Phase Meter started acting up. When Foster looked at it, including banging it on the table, she brushed it off as nothing, but Lewis believed it to be the readings Erik Selvig mentioned to them. However, Foster told Lewis to go away, so she did, allowing Foster to return to her date. As the date continued, Foster couldn't help but be distracted by what she had seen, so Madison to let Foster leave the date to go with her friend.

Possessed by the Aether
Foster arrives at the anomaly's location
Foster then joined Darcy Lewis in her car, as she knew she would come, much to Foster's annoyance. As they drove to the location, Foster was shocked when she discovered Ian Boothby in the backseat, who was Lewis' intern. Foster then tried to contact Erik Selvig to tell him about their discovery, but was once again was unsuccessful in reaching him. When they arrived, Foster explored the area until Lewis called her and they went towards the warehouse.

Foster discovers an anomaly in the warehouse
When they entered the warehouse, they discovered three kids inside, who asked if they were the police. Foster revealed to them that she was a scientist and asked if she could see what they had found, so they brought them to a truck that was levitating in the air, which one of the kids was able to flip over with ease, to Foster's awe.

Foster analyzing the anomaly
The kids then showed them up a stairwell, where one of the kids dropped a bottle down that suddenly vanished on the way down. When Foster asked where it went, the bottle reappeared from higher up. Excited by this anomaly, Foster threw a can, but it did not return, which one of the kids revealed sometimes things don't return. Foster started to analyze the anomaly, noting how the readings were similar to when Thor arrived in New Mexico.

Foster being transported through a portal
Leaving the others to play with the portal, Foster went to investigate the anomaly, detecting more readings as she explored the warehouse. When Foster came across a dark hallway, the Phase Meter started to emit stronger and wilder readings as a powerful gust of wind emerged. Suddenly, Foster was mysteriously pulled forward and swallowed through a portal.

Foster discovering the Aether in the Chamber
Foster was transported to an alien world, much to her shock, where she attempted to call out for help, but there was no response. Foster then explored her surroundings, where she discovered the Chamber, possessing an unknown red substance inside it. When Foster looked inside, the substance latched itself onto her, slithered out and was absorbed into her.

The Aether being fused into Foster's body
After entering through her hand and now completely surging through her body, Foster became terrified, not knowing what was happening to her. In shock, Foster then passed out, allowing the substance to take control over her and started to grow stronger. Five hours later, Foster was transported back to the warehouse, where she awoke, unsure of what just happened to her.

Reunited with Thor
Foster notices the rain's odd behaviour
Foster then exited the warehouse, where she discovered the police had arrived and were talking to Darcy Lewis, who had called them. Foster was mad at her for ruining their unimpeded access to the anomaly, which she now feared that S.H.I.E.L.D. would arrive and take over, but Lewis revealed that she had been gone for five hours.

Foster and Thor are finally reunited again
When it started to rain, Foster noticed none of it was occurring around them, to their confusion. However, the cause for strange rain occurrence was revealed when Foster spotted Thor, who had returned to Earth, standing before them. Foster then walked over to Thor, with the rain still not going on her, and slapped him to check if he was real, due to experiencing several strange occurrences that day. Now certain that it is him, Foster slapped Thor again for leaving her and never coming back even though he promised her he would.

Foster learns why Thor never returned for her
When Foster asked where Thor was, he asked the same question back, informing her that Heimdall could not see her. However, Foster ignored it, telling Thor about how she was distraught after he left. Thor then explained to her that he was unable to return for her, as the Bifrost Bridge was destroyed and he needed to protect the Nine Realms from the chaos that ensued.

Foster and Thor almost about to kiss
Foster then brought up that she saw Thor on TV when he was in New York with the Avengers, but he once again explained that it was to protect Earth form the dangers of his world. Thor then expressed that he was wrong for allowing his duty to not return to Foster, and that he believed it was fate that had brought them together once again. Finally reunited with each other, Thor attempted to express his love for Foster, as they moved in to kiss.

The Aether protects Foster from the police
They were interrupted when Lewis walked over to them to inform Foster that they were about to be arrested. Foster then left her moment with Thor to deal with the police, who questioned whether she knew Ian Boothby, who they were frisking. An officer then told Foster that she was trespassing on private property, and when he went to grab her, the substance fused in her reacted, releasing a powerful blast of energy, knocking the officer away.

Foster travels to Asgard in the Bifrost Bridge
This blast caused Foster to fall to the ground, and Thor rushed to check on her, protecting her from the police, who wanted to take her in. Knowing that there was something wrong with her that was beyond human containment, Thor decided to call upon the Bifrost to take her to Asgard. Foster held onto Thor as they travelled from Earth in the Bifrost, being amazed by what she was experiencing, and long dreamed of doing.

Learning of the Aether
Foster arrives in Asgard for the first time
When they exited the Bifrost Bridge, Foster expressed her enjoyment travelling in it. Arriving in Himinbjorg, Foster noticed Heimdall, who welcomed her to Asgard.

Foster being examined in the Soul Forge
Worried about her condition, Thor brought Foster to a group of Asgardian physicians to be examined. While Foster was in the Soul Forge, she couldn't resist the urge to ask questions about it. After an inspection, she realized that the Soul Forge was just like a quantum field generator, spurring the physicians with her level of knowledge.

Foster witnesses Odin's arrival
Suddenly, Odin entered the room, where he expressed that Foster does not belong on Asgard, being a mortal, despite Thor telling him she was sick. Insulted by Odin's words against her, Foster spoke up, only to be informed that he was King of Asgard, Thor's father, and that he knew who Foster was.

Foster's body is drained more by the Aether
Thor tried to convince Odin that Foster was ill, only for the King to remind him that her world had doctors, which could treat her. Odin then ordered guards to escort Foster out of Asgard, but when they touched her, the Aether reacted again to protect her, knocking away the guards. Odin then understood the severity of Foster's illness and examined her, determining that the Aether was protecting itself, not Foster.

Foster learns the Aether's history from Odin
Odin then showed Foster and Thor the Book of Yggdrasil and explained the history of the Aether, an Infinity Stone that takes the form of a liquid, unlike the other stones. Odin also explained how it has the power to change matter and that it seeks out host bodies, where it draws its strength. Foster then asked Odin if he knew how to get the Aether out of her, but he didn't know.

Sacking of Asgard
Foster being escorted to her chambers
Not able to remove the Aether from her body, Thor decided to keep Foster in Asgard for her own safety. Foster was escorted to her chambers, where a maiden provided her some clothes, although she attempted to request something with pants, to the maiden's confusion.

Foster walking through Asgard with Thor
After Foster rested, she went to explore Asgard, where she became captivated by the Magnetic-Propulsion Ball, believing it could advance Earth science significantly. Foster was then joined by Thor, who informed Foster that she had accidentally taken a ball from some kids, so she returned it. The two took a walk around the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf. During their walk, Foster asked Thor how he knew to find her when she was in trouble. Thor explained to Foster how Heimdall could not see her on Earth when she discovered the Aether.

Thor teaches Foster about the Convergence
Thor then taught Foster about the Convergence, an event where the Nine Realms align perfectly, which was how Foster was transported from Earth to the Aether's location. Listening to Thor explain things to her, Foster found herself immediately falling back in love with him, and the two shared a kiss. 

Foster learning of the Sacking of Asgard
Scared on what would happen to her, Thor promised Foster he would find a way to save her. The two were then joined by Frigga, who Thor informed Foster was his mother, which made her nervous as she greeted the Queen. Soon after, they noticed a commotion from the Asgardian Dungeons, so Frigga told Thor to investigate it, promising to look after Foster.

Foster protected by Frigga during the skirmish
Foster then stayed with Frigga as she went to find Odin, expressing her concern for his safety. As the two had an intimate conversation, Foster noticed Sif walk by, and the two stared at each other, although for different reasons. Frigga then armed herself and asked Foster to do everything she asked with no questions, which she complied with. Frigga then brought Foster to her chambers and created an illusion of her.

Foster's illusion being protected from Malekith
Foster then hid as Malekith entered the chambers, where he was confronted by Frigga. Malekith then revealed he came for the Aether inside Foster, so Frigga attacked the Dark Elf to protect Foster. After a brief duel, Frigga overwhelmed Malekith, but was stopped when Kurse entered, who restrained her. Malekith then approached Foster, only to discover the illusion Frigga had cast, causing him to order Kurse to kill the Queen. When Thor arrived, Malekith retreated, and Foster came out of hiding, finding Frigga dead.

Foster and Thor attend the funeral for Frigga
That night, a funeral was held for those who were killed in the skirmish, including the Queen of Asgard, who died protecting Foster from the Dark Elves. Foster attended the ceremony to pay her respects to Frigga. During the funeral, Foster stood with Thor to support him as they watched Frigga's spirit ascend to Valhalla.

Imprisonment
Foster receiving a vision from the Aether
The next day, while Foster was sitting in her chambers, the Aether gave her a vision of Asgard consumed by the its darkness. When she snapped out of it, Foster decided to visit Yggdrasil in the Hall of Science so she could work, as it helped her when she didn't know what to do.

Foster learning more about the Aether
Foster was able to understand how to operate it very quickly, where she learned more about the Aether. When Thor entered, Foster apologized, blaming herself for Frigga's death, but Thor told her it wasn't her fault. Foster then informed Thor of her discoveries, when they were interrupted by Tyr, who came to imprison Foster under Odin's orders. Thor refused to let her be imprisoned, but Foster  agreed to be taken, not wanting to cause anymore problems.

Liberation
Foster punching Loki for attacking New York
Imprisoned in her chambers, Foster was brought a meal, which she refused, just as Sif arrived and knocked out the two guards. Sif told Foster to come with her, as she was freeing her as apart of Thor's plan to defeat Malekith. Foster was reunited with Thor, as well as his brother Loki, who she recognised from his attack on New York, so she punched him.

Foster faints while escaping Asgard
When the Einherjar arrived to stop them, Thor escaped with Foster and Loki to leave Asgard, while Sif stayed behind to give them time. They came across Volstagg, who was waiting for them by a Harrow ship for them to escape in. Once they boarded the ship, Thor, after several failed attempts, managed to fly them out of the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf. While escaping, Foster became faint due to the Aether draining her, causing her to collapse.

When they reached the Rainbow Bridge, Thor picked up Foster and exited the ship, landing in an Asgardian Skiff piloted by Fandral. Thor then laid Foster down so she could rest, as Loki took control of the skiff to take them a secret portal. Loki was successful in helping Foster and Thor escape Asgard and arrive in Svartalfheim.

Free of the Aether

Having successfully arrived in Svartalfheim, Loki piloted them through the wastelands from First Dark Elf Conflict as Foster continued to rest on the Asgardian Skiff as she was getting weaker from the Aether.

The Aether alerts Foster of Malekith
Soon after, Foster was awoken by the Aether, allowing her to alert Thor and Loki that they were approaching Malekith's location. They then exited the skiff and continued on foot, where they reach the top of a cliff, spotting the Dark Elves exiting an Ark. Thor then checked if Foster was ready, preparing to execute his plan to have the Aether removed from her body, which she confirmed she was.

Foster being bargained to Malekith by Loki
When Thor uncuffed Loki, Foster watched as the God of Mischief betrayed his brother, stating him with one of his daggers, unknown to Foster that it was apart of the plan. Foster then chased after Thor, who was kicked down the cliff and had his hand cut off by Loki. When Foster went to check on Thor, she was grabbed by Loki, who used her to bargain with Malekith to watch Asgard fall.

Malekith extracting the Aether from Foster
Malekith then commenced removing the Aether from Foster, raising her up and draining it from her body. As the Aether was being removed, Foster saw another vision of Malekith's plan to cover the entire universe in darkness. The Aether was then completely separated from Foster, so Loki cut the illusion, allowing Thor to summon Mjølnir to destroy the Aether. Thor sent a blast of lightning into the Aether, Loki dived to protect Foster from the explosion.

Foster witnesses the Aether reforming
However, they were unsuccessful, as the Aether soon reformed and was absorbed by Malekith. The Dark Elves, having got what they wanted, began to leave, with Kurse throwing a Black Hole Grenade at them, causing Loki to push Foster out of the way to save her. Foster got to safety as the two brothers faced off against Kurse and the Dark Elves, allowing Malekith to escape.

Foster watches Loki "die" in Thor's arms
The fight came to an end when Loki used a Black Hole Grenade to kill Kurse, also resulting in him being fatally stabbed. Foster then came out of hiding and watched as Loki died in Thor's arms, sharing a look of sadness with Thor as Loki had helped save her life. When a storm came over Svartalfheim, the two found refuge in a cave, where Foster informed Thor of Malekith's plan to go to Earth.

Return to Earth
Foster is called by Richard Madison in a cave
When Foster revealed that she only found the Aether because she was looking for Thor, she suddenly received a phone call from Richard Madison. Foster answered the call, amazed by the incredible reception she was receiving.

Foster and Thor return to London
Foster then explored the cave for answers only to realize that they were near the portal she discovered in the stairwell back in London. Foster picked up the car keys that Ian Boothby threw into the portal, and she and Thor walked through it, being transported to Earth. Foster and Thor, having returned to London, found Darcy Lewis' car and used it to return to her apartment, while Thor questioned Foster on Madison, to her annoyance.

Foster and Erik Selvig reunite in her apartment
When they entered Foster's apartment, they found Lewis and Boothby inside, who were surprised by their sudden return, not knowing where they had been since they left Earth. Foster then discovered Erik Selvig was there, too, and they hugged, as she asked for everything he had on the Convergence. Foster then went to get changed out of her Asgardian dress, and the group formulated a plan to stop Malekith.

Foster informs the group of Malekith's plan
Foster used the vision she saw to inform the rest of Malekith's plan to fire the Aether where the Nine Realms will connect, increasing its power, causing mass destruction. Selvig was able to figure out Malekith's location to unleash this chaos in Greenwich. Foster then stated the importance of stopping Malekith, as the fabric of reality would be torn apart if he is successful.

Battle of Greenwich
Foster heading to plant a Gravimetric Spike
The group then travelled to Greenwich where Foster, Erik Selvig, Darcy Lewis and Ian Boothby went around the site planting the Gravimetric Spikes to disrupt the Convergence. Foster teamed up with Selvig as they entered the library, where Foster was shushed because her boots were making noises.

Foster activating the Gravimetric Spikes
When Foster and Selvig planted their spike, an Ark arrived as the Convergence begun, so they rushed to the top of the tower. As Thor battled Malekith on the ground, Foster was attempting to activate the spikes, which Selvig was not sure would work. However, they were still waiting for Lewis and Boothby to finish as Thor continued to buy them time.

Foster teleports the army of Dark Elves
Foster then went to check on Lewis and Boothby, who had planted their last spike, giving Foster the signal to activate them. With the Convergence fully aligning soon, Foster then began to keep Malekith and the Dark Elves busy, using the spikes to teleport the Dark Elves through rifts. While using the spikes, Foster accidentally teleported Lewis and Boothby away with two Dark Elves.

Foster and Erik Selvig run from the Dark Elves
Having completed their task, Foster and Selvig then left the tower, warning the people in the library to also get to safety. As the two exited the building, the connection to the spikes was lost, as they were chased by a group of Dark Elves. As they ran away from the Dark Elves, Foster reactivated the spikes, allowing her to teleport them away, while simultaneously teleporting Lewis and Boothby to their location, discovering them making out.

Foster and Thor discuss defeating Malekith
With the Convergence aligning and Malekith unleashing the Aether's power, Foster noted that they were out of time and went to retrieve the spikes. When she regrouped with Thor, they informed him that the spikes could still stop Malekith, but they needed to get close, which Thor could do. Thor then took the spikes and headed towards Malekith in the Aether storm, as Foster watched on, standing by to activate them.

Foster successfully teleports Malekith away
As Thor hurled two spikes at Malekith, Foster activated them, teleporting his arms to Svartalfheim. When Thor impaled the last spike into Malekith's chest, Foster activated it, teleporting the Dark Elf away from Earth. With the threat eliminated, Foster checked on Thor, who had been knocked out. Noticing the Ark collapsing, Foster then ran to Thor to try and save him, but he was too heavy, and she couldn't move him. 

Foster holding onto Thor before being crushed
With the ship about to crash on top of them, Foster accepted that she couldn't save Thor and decided to hold onto him, not wanting to be without him. While waiting for the ship to crush them, Foster discovered that Selvig had been teleported it away, saving them. Now that the battle was completely over and the Convergence ended, Foster rested herself on Thor as he woke up.

Relationship with Thor
Thor's Return
Foster discusses whether Thor will return
Thor told Foster that he had to return to Asgard to resolve everything with his father, as he committed treason when they escaped. Two days later, Foster and her friends were having breakfast in her apartment, still waiting for Thor to return, although the others were doubtful if he would anytime soon.

Foster and Thor passionately embrace
However, much like last time, Foster still remained hopeful that he would return as promised, especially after how their relationship had developed previously. As Foster sat at the table, she heard the roar of thunder followed by the Bifrost Bridge appearing outside. When Foster turned around, she became excited to see that Thor had returned, and rushed outside. The two then passionately embraced each other and proceeded to live out a life with each other.

Renowned Astrophysicist
Due to Thor's celebrity-like status as an Avenger, Foster's relationship with him then became publicly known. Foster kept studying the effects of the Convergence in London, making important discoveries in the field of astrophysics, and becoming a serious candidate for winning a Nobel Prize for her work. When Foster was showing her work to Thor at the University of London, they were interrupted by J.A.R.V.I.S. to inform them that Thor was needed to help fight HYDRA. Foster later lectured about her experiences on interspace and dimensional travel at WHiH World News.

Breaking Up With Thor
Some time after the Ultron Offensive, Foster broke up with Thor. Shortly after, Thor left Earth in order to locate the remaining Infinity Stones, although he briefly returned to New York City two years later, where he tried to explain to a fan, as well as Loki, that the breakup was a mutual decision.

Death and Resurrection
In 2018, Foster was a victim of the Snap. However, five years later, as a result of the Blip, Foster was restored to life.

Time Heist
Theft of the Reality Stone
Foster resting in Asgard
In an alternate 2013 timeline, while on Asgard, an alternate version of Foster enquired an Asgardian maiden if they had any extra pants before retreating into one of the chambers and taking a nap. When she awoke, Rocket Raccoon infiltrated Foster's chambers, sneaked up behind her and used a device to extract the Aether from her body, prompting him to be chased by the Einherjar.

Personality
Jane Foster is an extremely intelligent scientist, who has a strong dedication towards uncovering scientific truths, mainly in astrophysics. Foster has devoted her life to science, having built most of her equipment herself, and is willing to do anything for her research, like drive into a powerful storm or work with Thor to recover her equipment from S.H.I.E.L.D..

Research is usually Foster's top priority, as she couldn't resist checking out an anomaly even though she was on a date, and later got mad when Darcy Lewis called the police, disrupting their uninterrupted access to the anomaly. Foster puts a lot of faith into her research, even when others doubt her, but she never lets it dissuade her, especially as she ends up being correct many times. That is why she trusted Thor and believed his story even though Erik Selvig, her mentor, warned her against him.

Because of her investment into scientific research, Foster finds herself most confident in situations that cater for it, and finds working helpful to calm her. However, outside of her area of expertise, Foster can be awkward in social settings, as she doesn't interact with many people outside of the scientific community, also stating that she never has guests. When she went on a date with Richard Madison, Foster didn't know what to do, so she hid behind her menu not saying anything.

Although she is not immature, Foster possesses a strong childlike wonder in regards to scientific discoveries, mainly those originating from Asgard, where she is exhilarated by things like the Bifrost Bridge, the Soul Forge and even the Asgardians themselves. This fascination in a whole other world of science is one of the reasons why Foster fell in love with Thor.

While she is passionate for her research, the only other thing that could possibly equal it is her love for Thor. At first, Foster was just intrigued by him, as he could help with her research, although she did find Thor attractive. But when Foster bonded with Thor, and he taught her about the Nine Realms, she developed strong feelings for him, and would later reveal that she loves the way he explains things.

When Thor left Earth and didn't return, Foster was unable to get over him, and immediately fell back in love when he returned, despite the heartbreak he put her through. When they resparked their love, it was proven to be incredibly strong, as Foster was willing to die with Thor during the Battle of Greenwich when she wasn't able to save him from the crashing Ark. And when Thor left again, Foster still remained hopeful he would return, despite what happened last time.

This love has always been in Foster's nature, which is what makes her a terrific person, and was the main reason Thor understood humanity, allowing him to become worthy again. When Frigga died protecting her from Malekith, Foster felt responsible and didn't want any more harm to occur because of her. Additionally, when Loki "died", Foster was visibly saddened by this, even though she didn't like him, but because he had helped save her life.

Despite just being a human with no powers or fighting ability, Foster is always willing to help whenever she can, even though she is often surrounded by mighty allies. Foster helped in the evacuation of Puente Antiguo when the Destroyer arrived, even though Thor asked her to get to safety, and was determined to stop Malekith from covering the universe in darkness with the Aether. Foster has even proven herself valuable in battles with her intellect, being an important part of Malekith's defeat, teleporting him away.

It can be perceived that Foster is very gentle and easy-going, as she revealed she has never done anything rebellious and dangerous before, but Foster isn't afraid to stand up for herself in heated moments. When S.H.I.E.L.D. confiscated all of her research and equipment, Foster argued with Phil Coulson, even though Selvig tried to tell her she shouldn't. Also, when she came across Loki while escaping Asgard, she immediately punched him without hesitation, due to him attacking New York.
