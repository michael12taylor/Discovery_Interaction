<html><p>Having put on the Spider-Man Suit, Parker began practicing how he would arrive at the party and impress everybody, although he began to get cold feet. While on the roof, Parker then spotted a large blue explosion far off in the distance. Wishing to investigate, Spider-Man donned his mask and swung off the roof, only to quickly find himself in the middle of the park with nothing for his Web-Shooters to attach onto, forcing Spider-Man to simply run towards the explosion.

Conflict with Vulture
Chase of Vulture's Crew
Spider-Man spies on an illegal weapons deal
Before long, Spider-Man found Jackson Brice as he was trying to sell weapons on the black market, some of which Spider-Man deduced were the same as from the Robbery of the Queens Community Bank the other day, with Brice demonstrating the Ultron Blaster Gun. As Spider-Man watched, Aaron Davis, the buyer explained that he was not interested in such dangerous weapons and still preferred a simple gun to use.

Spider-Man fighting against Jackson Brice
While Brice was attempting to show off his Black Hole Grenade set and other equipment for Davis to possibly buy, their deal was suddenly interrupted when they heard a call ringtone as Ned Leeds' had called Spider-Man about his whereabouts as he was expecting him back at Liz Toomes' party to impress the guests. This made the two criminals instantly believe that Davis had set them up and aimed their guns at him. Intent on saving Davis, Spider-Man then intervened and told the two thugs to shoot him instead of Davis. Herman Schultz happily obliged before Brice put on Shocker's Gauntlet and punched Spider-Man with some considerable force before they attempted to make their escape.

Spider-Man is dragged across all the streets
A chase then ensued as Spider-Man used his Web-Shooters to web onto the thug's van and was dragged along as they tried to make their escape, causing damage throughout the neighborhood. While Spider-Man was dragged through the streets, Brice then used his weapons within the truck to continue firing at Spider-Man, managing to also damage his own truck during their clash. Eventually, Spider-Man was driven into a brick post and lost his grip on the truck.

Spider-Man runs into neighborhood homes
Finally managing to shake him off the van, Brice and Schultz attempt to make their escape while Spider-Man was left to chase and search for them yet again. Running through the outskirts of New York City, Spider-Man struggled to use his Web-Shooters as he ran through residential housing, encountering local people while bringing down a treehouse and crashing through a garden shed. Spider-Man landed by a girl's tent, as the girls then loudly screamed.

Spider-Man being ambushed by Vulture
Spider-Man continued to keep track of the van, causing considerably more disturbance throughout the neighborhood in his pursuit. Before long, he managed to find the criminal's van. Just as he was about to jump onto their van, Vulture appeared and grabbed him from behind, using his Vulture's Exo-Suit to violently pull Spider-Man into the sky. Spider-Man struggled to get off this new adversary's grip as Vulture continued bringing him higher up into the sky.

Spider-Man's life is just saved by Iron Man
During their struggle when Vulture reached high enough, the Spider-Man Suit's emergency parachute activated. The parachute caught the wind and allowed Spider-Man to get off Vulture's grip, crashing him into the lake below. The parachute hindered Spider-Man and he struggled to release himself from it, seemingly about to drown. All of a sudden, Iron Man appeared and rescued him, managing to pull him out of the lake and onto dry land before he could drown.

Saved by Iron Man
Spider-Man is soon confronted by Iron Man
Pulling him up from the lake, Tony Stark talked to Parker as he dried off in the neighborhood playground. Parker had inquired how Stark knew where was, asking if he put a tracker into the Spider-Man Suit before Stark then revealed that he actually did put a tracker inside the suit, along with various other advanced features, including a heater to dry him off following his near-drowning inside the lake. Spider-Man suggested that the Avengers might need to get involved to bring down Vulture's Crew, but Iron Man insisted the situation with Vulture was below the Avengers' pay grade.

Spider-Man and Iron Man discuss Vulture
As Parker insisted that Stark did not have to have come all the way out to help him, Stark then revealed that he was not there in person and that he was remotely controlling the Mark XLVII Armor while he was currently in India. While Iron Man insisted that he stop looking into Vulture and just protect New York City from muggers, Spider-Man insisted he was ready for more, pointing to his fight with Captain America, but Stark had still refused to accept this explanation.

Spider-Man discovers some Chitauri weapons
Once Stark had left, Ned Leeds called Parker and advised him not to return to the party since Flash Thompson had continued to make a mockery out of him while he had been gone. As Spider-Man began to leave the area, he discovered a Chitauri Energy Core that had been left behind by Brice and Schultz during the chase, while Spider-Man took it away to attempt to get a lead on what weaponry the criminals were working with and how to eventually track them all down.

Tracking Vulture
Parker and Ned Leeds test out the technology
Despite his talk of desisting with Tony Stark, Parker still began investigating his new adversary. He had told Ned Leeds about his own terrifying encounter with Vulture and his discovery of their Chitauri Energy Core which had been left behind in the wake of his chase with Jackson Brice. While Leeds expressed his delight at merely being a part of this situation, Parker used a hammer to break the core, as Barry Hapgood advised his students to keep their fingers clear of the blades, while Parker and Leeds agreed on what to do next before doing their own traditional handshake.

Parker attempting to follow Herman Schultz
Once they had spent some time examining the Chitauri power core which Leeds could only think to call their glowy thingy, they had then encountered Herman Schultz and Randy Vale who had both arrived while they were still searching for the core through Midtown School of Science and Technology. While Parker dragged Leeds out of the way, he explained that Schultz had attempted to kill him the night before alongside Jackson Brice. Although Leeds insisted that they run and hide, Parker noted that by following them he could try and get a lead on Vulture, ignoring Leeds' pleas as he attempted to follow Schultz and Vale, as they searched through the school.

Parker puts a tracker onto Herman Schultz
Having eventually managed to convince a reluctant Leeds to stay put beside Tiny McKeever's chess game for his safety, Parker followed Schultz and Vale during their search, as they then made their way into Hapgood's workshop where they had just been studying. Hiding underneath a table, Parker watched as Schultz and Vale eventually gave up their search and, as they were both leaving the school, Parker then fired his Spider-Tracer onto Schultz's shoe.

Parker waits to learn of Vulture's location
Returning to the Parker Residence together, Parker and Leeds used the Tracer on Schultz's boot to begin following the gang's current movements as they made their way outside of New York City. While Leeds marveled at all the technology that Tony Stark had supplied Parker with, Parker himself passed the time by experimenting with the Spider-Signal and some of the other bits of tech all while Leeds had still continued closely following Schultz's movements. In boredom, Leeds asked Parker to wear his mask, finding it to be rather awesome.

Parker and Ned Leeds locate Vulture
Eventually, while Leeds was trying on the Spider-Man Mask and Parker was resting on the ceiling, they learned that Schultz and Vale had finally stopped in Maryland. While they discussed with Schultz and his gang had an evil lair, they discussed how they would get to Maryland, with Parker remembering that the Decathlon was taking place in Washington, D.C. so he could get a lift with their team who were heading out the next day for the Decathlon finals.

Decathlon Trip
Parker rejoining the school's decathlon team
Seeking to get a lift to Maryland to intercept Vulture's Crew, Parker ran up to the decathlon team as they were all soon heading onto Washington, D.C. for the national tournament, asking to rejoin the team. Although Flash Thompson had rejected the idea as he had taken Parker's spot, Roger Harrington was delighted to have Parker back and immediately agreed, causing Abe Brown to tease Thompson for being demoted before Michelle Jones insisted they get moving so she had time for protesting.

Parker gets a phone call from Happy Hogan
During the bus ride to Washington, D.C., Liz Toomes questioned their team to get them ready for the finals, with Parker even correctly answering a question about Vibranium. Parker, however, excused himself when he got a call from Happy Hogan who was questioning why Parker had just left New York City, having followed the tracker in the Spider-Man Suit. Parker managed to convince Hogan that the situation was no big deal, although Hogan insisted that he would be watching.

Parker overlooking the Triskelion cleanup
While nearing their destination, Parker, Jones and Leeds caught sight of the wreckage of the Triskelion still present. Jones came over to them and had explained that Damage Control was still clearing up the destruction left behind by Captain America during the Battle at the Triskelion several years prior. While Jones had expressed her own conspiracy theories about these events, Parker wondered where Damage Control would take all the equipment and technology that they recovered.

Parker and Ned Leeds hack into his suit
With the help of Ned Leeds, Parker began removing the tracker from inside his Suit, noting that he did not want Tony Stark to know where he was while he tracked Vulture's Crew. When Leeds questioned if he was now lying to Iron Man, Parker insisted that he was not lying but just wanted Stark to fully understand everything he could do as a hero, while Parker then successfully found and removed the tracker which he placed on a lamp, leaving Hogan to track that instead.

Parker frustrated over being treated like a kid
Leeds then learned that the suit had more subsystems which all had been disabled by the Training Wheels Protocol, much to Parker's frustration as he noted how Stark still treated him as a child. Eager to prove himself to Stark, Parker had eventually managed to convince Leeds to disable the protocol despite his friend's misgivings over the decision, commenting that doing this for him would make Leeds his guy in the chair and also allowing Parker to truly prove himself.

Parker is invited swimming by Liz Toomes
Having seen that Herman Schultz was back on the move, Parker put the suit back in his bag and prepared to track him down, also telling Leeds to look after the Chitauri Energy Core while he was gone. On his way out, Parker had then encountered Liz Toomes who, along with the rest of their Decathlon team were all about to go swimming, as Flash Thompson ran by and slapped Parker on his behind. Parker, however, claimed he could not join as he was going to study.

Parker decides to leave all his friends behind
Despite Toomes having expressed just how important winning this Decathlon was to her and her belief that them engaging in rebellious activity could help them win, Parker still decided to prioritize tracking down Vulture and the rest of his crew. Sitting outside a window in the Spider-Man Suit, Parker watched as Toomes swam with Charles Murphy and Cindy Moon along with the rest, enjoying themselves as Parker remained alone, still focused on his current mission.

Damage Control Truck Attack
Spider-Man goes in search of Vulture's Crew
Upon donning the Spider-Man Suit with removed restrictions, Spider-Man discovered that the suit was harboring his own personal A.I. system. Upon introducing herself to him and congratulating him on seemingly passing through the Training Wheels Protocol, the A.I. began to teach Spider-Man all about the suit's full capabilities. Spider-Man then told the A.I. about the Spider-Tracer and he was shown exactly where it was and how to find it as they traveled through Washington, D.C. to find the Tracer's location.

Spider-Man eventually finds Herman Schultz
Before long they located Vulture's Crew near an empty gas station, which Spider-Man mistook for their Headquarters. Using the suit's advanced function to overhear their conversation, Spider-Man then overheard Herman Schultz and Phineas Mason talking together as they discussed getting Shocker's Gauntlet from Crossbones before Spider-Man then learned that the crew intended to steal confiscated alien tech from Damage Control transfer trucks coming by shortly.

Spider-Man trying out his new Web-Shooters
As Spider-Man prepared to engage with Vulture's Crew, his new A.I. recommended new features active in his suit, only for Spider-Man to discover she meant an "instant kill mode" which he rejected, not wishing to kill anyone. The A.I. then showed Spider-Man his new Web-Shooters and it's many more advanced web-shooter combinations. However, Spider-Man was still learning, this resulted in him picking the wrong options and falling on his face before electrocuting the gas station.

Spider-Man witnesses Vulture's robbery
Spider-Man had then witnessed the arrival of Vulture, who was using his Vulture's Exo-Suit to catch up with and attach himself to the Damage Control truck that was driving by. Spider-Man went after the truck and found Vulture had used a Matter Phase Shifter to get inside where he was stealing all of the Chitauri and Ultron based technology that he could get his hands on. Taking his bag from him, Spider-Man confronted Vulture when he was about to leave.

Spider-Man is forced into fighting Vulture
Vulture, however, refused to allow Spider-Man to take his profit away from him and reattached himself to his Exo-Suit and furiously attacked Spider-Man. Spider-Man managed to dodge the attack, however, he discovered that the Webs that his A.I. had selected were useless in the fight. While Spider-Man was forced to desperately avoid all Vulture's attacks, he had then begged his A.I. to fix his webs while Vulture still furiously attempted to take his bag back.

Spider-Man is knocked out inside of the van
During the course of the battle, Spider-Man pulled the bag back from Vulture and fell back inside the van, causing the bag to fall with him while the Matter Phase Shifter closed behind him. Not noticing that the Phase Shifter had closed, Spider-Man accidentally knocked himself unconscious when he banged his head against the ceiling in his hasty attempt to get out, allowing Vulture time to make his escape, despite still losing the bag full of stolen technology.

Trapped in the Storage Vault
Spider-Man prepares to confront Vulture
Spider-Man eventually awoke inside the truck, as the A.I informed him that he appeared to have a mild concussion from smashing his head into the truck's ceiling. Hours later, Spider-Man questioned where he was, although his A.I. was unsure, leading Spider-Man to conclude that the truck had been hijacked and taken into Vulture's Headquarters, leading Spider-Man to believe that they would have to fight their way to freedom. Charging towards the doors, Spider-Man then smashed through and expected to be confronted by the rest of Vulture's Crew, only to discover he was in a massive federal warehouse.

Spider-Man inside Damage Control's Vault
While he looked around confused, the A.I then informed Spider-Man that he was inside Damage Control's Deep Storage Vault and that he would most likely not be able to leave until the following morning. At first, Spider-Man desperately attempted to force the door open to no avail, kicking it in annoyance before finally giving up and exploring the facility. While waiting, Spider-Man discussed giving the A.I. her own name, soon deciding on Karen which she approved of.

Spider-Man names his suit's A.I. Karen
Deciding to wait it out, Spider-Man then spent some time learning his different Web-Shooters combinations such as the web-grenade and web-net, ricochet web, splitter web, and web-wings, also looking at the Spider-Man Suit's upgrades which included wings. During all this time, Spider-Man made a hammock from his web-shooters and lay in it, seemingly nothing to do but just wait the night. Spider-Man talked to her about his close feelings for Liz Toomes with Karen.

Spider-Man searches through the technology
Eventually, Parker asked how many minutes have gone by, Karen had replied with thirty-seven minutes, growing impatient and he went on to explore, searching through Vulture's duffel bag he left behind. Finding Ultron's head and another purple Chitauri power core, Karen told Spider-Man that Chitauri Energy Core will explode if exposed to enough radiation. Horrified and knowing that Ned Leeds had still the core with him, Spider-Man realized his friend was in danger.

Spider-Man manages to unlock the door
Spider-Man immediately began to try to get himself out of the Vault as he worked together with Karen to attempt to manually open the door by tinkering with the fuse box. Following two hundred and forty-seven attempts of using different combinations to unlock the door, Spider-Man then managed to open the door and immediately began making his journey back to Washington, D.C., while still desperately attempting to contact Leeds and inform him of the danger.

Washington Monument Rescue
Spider-Man rushes back to save his friends
After managing to get out of the Damage Control facility, Spider-Man then desperately begged Karen to track down his friends while he hitched rides on passing vehicles being unable to swing to the city. Spider-Man had continued to call Ned Leeds numerous times, but found Leeds had no signal to pick up. As he was missing, Flash Thompson took Parker's place in the Decathlon, much to Liz Toomes' annoyance, although they still managed to win their competition. Parker tracked all his friends to the Washington Monument and just reached the Monument at the moment the Chitauri Energy Core exploded, causing massive damage.

Spider-Man realizes his friends are in danger
Upon finally arriving on the scene, Spider-Man had looked up as the Monument and had found Michelle Jones sitting outside who had then informed him that all of her friends were now currently trapped inside the Monument elevator with seemingly no way out. Karen then confirmed that the elevator had just been severely damaged by the Energy Core's explosion and that it would then plummet all the way back down to the ground floor in just a short amount of time.

Spider-Man climbs the Washington Monument
With limited time to act, Spider-Man immediately began to crawl on the Monument and tried to reach the top as quickly as he can. Using his Web-Shooters, Spider-Man attempted to propel himself forward with more speed; however, he found himself becoming intimidated by the height he was now at, with Karen informed him that since he had used his only parachute from the Spider-Man Suit during his recent encounter with Vulture, if he fell off the Monument then he would very likely be killed as a result, which he did not appreciate.

Spider-Man attempts to enter the Monument
As Spider-Man reached the top of the Monument were his friends were in danger, his rescue attempt gained the attention of the local authority who dispatched a helicopter to confront him and order him away. Spider-Man attempted to explain the situation to them but they instead started to demand Spider-Man to leave the monument and get back on the ground on the threat of being shot, however, Spider-Man sent the Spider-Tracer to find a way into the Monument.

Spider-Man rescues all of his classmates
Ignoring the threats, Spider-Man managed to enter the monument by jumping over the helicopter blades with the aid of the wings on the suit before then swinging back towards the monument and breaking through the windows. He barely managed to get inside in time to hold the elevator with his Web-Shooters as it started to plummeted to the ground. Spider-Man managed to save his schoolmates and his teacher Roger Harrington who were trapped in the elevator.

Spider-Man manages to save Liz Toomes
While Ned Leeds celebrated the rescue, Spider-Man told him to stop moving as he helped everyone to safety. However, Liz Toomes fell and Spider-Man was forced to catch her mid-air and pull her back up to the safety of her friends. While hanging upside down, Spider-Man checked that Toomes was safe while Karen recommended that he kiss her. However, Spider-Man's web then snapped, causing him to fall, while Flash Thompson questioned if he knew Parker.

Back to New York
Parker enjoying the attention on Spider-Man
In the wake of the events in Washington, D.C., Parker returned to New York City where he had been delighted to see all of the new positive attention being put on Spider-Man following the success of the Rescue at the Washington Monument. As he walked down their school's hallways, Parker saw school news reports by Betty Brant and Jason Ionello discussing Spider-Man's heroic actions saving his classmates.

Parker and Ned Leeds discussing Spider-Man
While Parker was making his way through all the school's hallways, he was then greeted by Ned Leeds who questioned what it was like being famous without anyone actually knowing it was him. Parker told Leeds once again to not tell anybody the truth. Parker revealed he was not going to class, noting that he figured out Vulture was using the technology stolen from Damage Control to make weapons and all he had to do now was catch Vulture in the act.

Parker is forced into sitting down in detention
As Parker expressed his belief that Tony Stark would soon recruit him into the Avengers for an act of great heroism, he therefore concluded he need not have to worry about attending school, just as Morita overheard and then gave him detention for planning on skipping class. In detention with Michelle Jones, Parker watched a video of Captain America before decided to walk out, with Andre Wilson not even bothering to attempt to stop Parker, who had proceeded to collect his hidden Synthetic Webbing and left the school.

Parker and Karen discussing Aaron Davis
Returned back home into the Parker Residence, Parker immediately resumed his hunt for Vulture as he donned the Spider-Man Mask and spoke with Karen. Parker asked if Karen could help him identify the men he encountered under the bridge, as she revealed that she had access to video files through the Baby Monitor Protocol. Parker then watched the footage, seeing Jackson Brice and Herman Schultz as they threatened another man before Spider-Man had stepped in.

Spider-Man arrives to confront Aaron Davis
Spider-Man had learned from Karen that the buyer was Aaron Davis, a criminal who was living in New York City and Spider-Man then went to confront him. Using the Spider-Drone to find Davis in a car park, Spider-Man proceeded to use his Web-Shooters to trap Davis to his car bonnet. At Karen's suggestion, Spider-Man put on "Intimidation Mode" which had amplified his vocal volume with voice modulation into a more intimidating presence. However, Davis soon saw through the deception, noting their previous encounter, which had Parker turn it off.

Spider-Man tries to interrogate Aaron Davis
Spider-Man demanded Davis tell him Vulture's location, insisting that he needed to know where to find the weapons and threatened Davis if he refused to tell him. Davis, however, was not intimidated and slammed his car bonnet down, making Spider-Man jump. Davis then questioned if Spider-Man had ever interrogated anyone before and then asked if Spider-Man knew about Delmar's Deli-Grocery, noting his own shock went it had been destroyed during a robbery.

Spider-Man learning of Vulture's location
 Grateful for saving him the other night when Schultz had tried to kill him, and caring for his nephew's safety, Davis informed Spider-Man about another weapons deal that would take place on involving Vulture and Mac Gargan. In his excitement at getting a lead, Spider-Man almost left before being told this was happening on the Staten Island Ferry. Davis had advised Spider-Man at getting better at being intimidating before Spider-Man left Davis stuck to his car.

Ambush at the Ferry
Spider-Man climbs the Staten Island Ferry
Following the lead given by Aaron Davis, Spider-Man raced expeditiously across New York City and had managed to sneak onboard the Staten Island Ferry by using the wings on his Spider-Man Suit to sour above the water and attach himself to the side of the Ferry. Spider-Man then went looking for Vulture, finding a man he assumed was the criminal speaking with Herman Schultz. He learned that they were about to deal with Mac Gargan to which Karen provided information about.

Spider-Man spies on Mac Gargan's deal
During his scouting, Tony Stark called Parker with the intention of apologizing for not answering his calls and having Parker instead try to speak with Happy Hogan. While Stark was still speaking to him, however, he could see that Randy Vale was preparing to hand over the Chitauri weapons to Gargan and the other criminals, so Spider-Man was forced to hang up on the annoyed Stark in order to focus on his targets before it was too late and Gargan got away.

Spider-Man interrupts the weapons deal
Spider-Man interrupted the deal and stealing the keys to the truck with all the Chitauri and Ultron based technology and then began fighting against the crew and Gargan's men. Spider-Man also fought against Schultz who had also gained possession of the Shocker's Gauntlet from Jackson Brice and then attempted to strike him with it. Spider-Man managed to defeat them, knocking Gargan overboard and trapping Schultz's arm, jokingly commenting that Brice had been considerably better with the Gauntlet than Schultz had been.

Spider-Man manages to subdue Shocker
Having also trapped Randy Vale with his web grenade, Spider-Man caught sight of the criminal Schultz had been speaking to earlier, assuming this was Vulture unmasked. Before Spider-Man could confront the man, however, he was then interrupted by FBI agents who had begun arresting everyone including Spider-Man who they mistook for Gargan's ally, much to Spider-Man's surprise as he tried to insist that he was not actually one of the criminals in this situation.

Spider-Man fighting against Vulture
This distraction was all Vulture needed to don his suit and began attacking Spider-Man and the FBI agents. While Spider-Man protected and saved the agents from the villain's attacks, Vulture freed his men and urged them to escape. Another fierce fight ensued as Vulture tried to kill Spider-Man with his advanced weaponry. Spider-Man countered by using his new Web-Shooters advanced function to even the odds, webbing Vulture to a car in an attempt to slow him down.

Spider-Man tries to disarm a Chitauri weapon
Vulture managed to free himself of Spider-Man's webbing by cutting through them with his wings and continued attacking him. Eventually, the fight resulted in Vulture's Chitauri alien weapon malfunctioning. Spider-Man tried to webbed the weapon up only for Vulture to say he was dealing with things he did not understand. The weapon had then exploded and cut the ferry in half while Spider-Man could only look on in utter horror as innocent people's lives were put in danger.

Spider-Man desperately tries to save the ferry
While Spider-Man overlooked the situation, Vulture and Schultz then managed to escape as Spider-Man desperately tried to save the people who were trapped inside the ferry which was slowly beginning to split in half. Karen quickly calculated all the strongest points of the ship and Spider-Man quickly went to work by webbing the strongest points together. By using his Web-Shooters and his enhanced speed, Spider-Man had seemingly managed to hold the ship together.

Spider-Man learns his attempts have failed
Taking a moment to catch his breath following his desperate attempt to save the ferry from splitting in half and sinking into the sea, Spider-Man overlooked his work as a member of the public cheered him on, only to learn that his missed one spot and the ship began collapsing once again. As the webs snapped one by one in quick succession, water began pouring inside the ferry, knocking people overboard and putting the lives of everybody still there in serious risk.

Spider-Man tries to hold together the Ferry
In complete desperation to keep people out of harm's way, Spider-Man proceeded to web up the sides of the ship and painfully held both halves of the ship by himself in a herculean effort to save the ship, but his efforts barely made a difference as the ship continued to split apart and sink. However, then Spider-Man noticed that the ship had seemingly stopped sinking and it had stopped being painful to hold the ship together. Iron Man then revealed himself and has come to rescue the civilians, taking control away from Spider-Man.

Spider-Man attempting to assist Iron Man
While Spider-Man could only watch on, Iron Man proceeded to use a series of mini-thrusters from his Mark XLVII Armor to use the sides of the ship back together, getting a cheer from the same man who had cheered on Spider-Man moments earlier. Iron Man had then quickly rebuilt the ship by reforging the cutlines, ignoring Spider-Man's offers to help by claiming he had done enough already. Once the ship was repaired, Iron Man took Spider-Man away to talk in private.

Final Test
Losing His Suit
Parker considers all of his near-fatal mistakes
Following the resolution of the Ferry incident, Parker sat on the outskirts of New York City and watched the people being rescued before Iron Man then approached him. Stark admonished Parker for his recklessness as his actions would have resulted in innocent people dying, but a frustrated Parker countered that he tried to warn Stark of the danger of Vulture and his criminal crew, but Stark had simply refused to listen to him.

Spider-Man furiously arguing with Iron Man
He further said that if Stark actually cared about the situation, then he would be here in person. Stark responded to this by stepping out of the Mark XLVII Armor and answered that he did listen to Parker. Stark told Parker that he was the only one who believed in him in spite of everyone else, including Happy Hogan, believing he had been crazy to recruit a kid and he was the one who tipped the FBI about Vulture and they would have succeeded if it wasn't for Parker's actions.

Parker is told to return the Spider-Man Suit
Then Stark demanded the Spider-Man Suit back, but Parker tearfully protested and pleaded that the suit was all he had and that he was nothing without it. Stark then replied that if he depends on the suit to be special, then he should not have it. Relenting, Parker stuttered that he has nothing else to wear if he takes off the suit, to which Stark told Parker he would take care of that. Before bringing him to the Parker Residence, Stark then bought Parker a shirt and pink pajamas.

Parker is furiously confronted by Aunt May
Getting home, Parker found Aunt May frustrated and worried for him, as she explained how she had been calling everywhere for Parker's whereabouts, including police stations within New York City and the mother of Ned Leeds' as she had learned Parker had been skipping classes and detention before witnessing the incident on the Ferry on the news. Noting how she knew he left the hotel room in Washington, D.C. and snuck out their home each night but did not know why.

Parker being kindly comforted by Aunt May
Desperate for answers, May demanded to know what he has been doing every night without her knowledge. In tears, Parker covered it up by explaining that the reason he had seemingly been rebelling was that he had lost the Stark Industries' Internship, claiming that despite how hard he had worked, he had managed to screw it up. While Parker sadly sat down, May believed his story and simply comforted her nephew, while Parker apologized for getting her so worried about him. May then finished their conversation by noting that she used to sneak out as well and recommending that Parker take a shower as she claimed he smelled like garbage.

Return to School
Parker sent out of Principal Morita's office
While being initially demoralized by the recent events with Vulture and the loss of his Spider-Man Suit, Parker chose the accept his forced retirement and rationalized that his goal of joining the Avengers was doomed to fail due to their permanent move to the New Avengers Facility. As he accepted that he should return to his daily life at Midtown School of Science and Technology, Parker was then sent to the office of Principal Morita who insisted that Parker was a good kid but gave him considerably more detention, much to Ned Leeds' relief as he assumed Parker was expelled.

Parker being forced to sit in longer detention
As demanded by Principal Morita, Parker was sent to sit into more detentions, with only Coach Andre Wilson and Michelle Jones for keeping herself company, Jones drew her sketches of Parker looking sad to entertain herself. However, the time away from being Spider-Man had allowed Parker to improve in his schoolwork, specifically in Spanish while he and Leeds finished the Lego Death Star they had worked on for several months, much to their considerable satisfaction.

Parker finally apologizes to Liz Toomes
With their upcoming homecoming celebration coming soon, Parker had begun to prepare himself for the celebration. In school, he met up with Liz Toomes, as he talked to her and apologized for missing the Decathlon final in Washington, D.C., although Toomes insisted that her near death experience had also caused her to reevaluate her priorities. Parker then finally confessed that he liked Toomes, which she admitted to already knowing, claiming that Parker was terrible at keeping secrets, making Parker chuckle. Building up all his courage, Parker learned Toomes had been too busy handling the celebration to find a date, as Parker then took the chance to ask her out.

Parker asks Liz Toomes to go to homecoming
To Parker's great surprise, Toomes accepted his offer. Delighted and suddenly overcome with awkwardness, Parker commented on how Principal Morita had given him considerable amounts of detention before noting that he was currently walking the wrong way to class. As he walked past Toomes and back towards his next lesson, Parker could not help but have a massive smile on his face as his attraction to Toomes was finally confirmed to be mutually shared by her.

Parker asking for assistance from Aunt May
Still delighted, Parker hurriedly returned to the Parker Residence and immediately asked Aunt May for her assistance to get ready for the homecoming dance to ensure that he was able to impress Toomes. With the help of May, Parker had learned to dress for the celebration which included spraying himself with some questionable aftershave and learning how to correctly tie a tie, which Parker had struggled to figure out until finally checking with May that he got it right.

Parker is taught how to dance by Aunt May
May also assisted Parker in learning how to dance and, although he found it quite awkward, the support and care he got from his Aunt allowed Parker to relax as he prepared himself for the dance. Parker also wrapped up a flower corsage which he had intended to give to Toomes as a gift. On the evening for Homecoming, May drove Parker to the Toomes Residence in order to pick up his date, as he prepared himself for the enjoyable evening with the beautiful Toomes.

Vulture's Secret
Parker shockingly greeted by Adrian Toomes
Parker headed to the Toomes Residence and then rang the doorbell, nervously waiting for Liz Toomes' parents to open the door and greet him. Much to his dread, Adrian Toomes opened the door, who Parker had immediately recognized as Vulture having once seen his face at the ferry, Parker was on guard while the unaware Toomes greeted Parker and welcomed him into his home, commenting on what a strong grip Parker had when they shook hands.

Parker considering Adrian Toomes's secrets
While the confused and quietly terrified Parker made his way through the house, he tried to hide his displeasure from Adrian as well as the revelation that his date's father was the man he has been hunting all this time. As Doris Toomes also greeted him, Adrian noted that Parker looked pale and jokingly offered him a whiskey or scotch, which Parker then turned down by noting that he was too young to drink, which Adrian confirmed was the correct answer to say to him.

Parker taking some pictures with Liz Toomes
They were then joined by Liz Toomes who showed off her dress intended for the party, with Adrian commenting on how beautiful she was, while Parker was so taken aback by the truth about Liz's father that he could barely bring himself to speak. As they prepared to leave, Doris insisted on taking some pictures, during which Parker to hardly keep his horrified eyes away from Adrian. After awkwardly taken pictures with Liz, Adrian then agreed to drive the two to the celebration.

Parker is driven to school by Adrian Toomes
As they drove to Midtown School of Science and Technology, Parker was asked by Adrian about what he planned to do once he finished school, with Liz noting how he had a Stark Industries internship and got to hang out with Tony Stark and Spider-Man, which seemed to interest Adrian. While they drove, Adrian questioned if he and Parker had ever met before, noting that even Parker's voice was familiar to him, with Liz noting that Parker also did Decathlon with her.

As the conversation continued, Liz casually noted how Parker had disappeared the night of her party and during Washington, D.C. Hearing this, Toomes realized these were the times Spider-Man had intercepted his arms deal and attempted robbery and was able to deduce that Parker was Spider-Man based on this information as well as the similarity with Parker's voice. Parker, however, attempted to remain calm while Adrian looked him directly in the eyes.

Parker is given a warning by Adrian Toomes
Stopping outside the school, Adrian told his daughter to get inside first while he has a dad talk with Parker, who became considerably more nervous being alone in the car with Vulture. Once alone, Toomes showed his true colors by pulling a gun outside of the glove compartment and asked Parker if Liz knew that he was Spider-Man to which Parker declined, as Toomes noted that he had secrets of his own that he still intended to keep quiet from his own family.

Parker is scared by Adrian Toomes' threats
Noting how important his family was to him, Toomes warned Parker to stay away from his business as he told Parker that he was grateful that he saved his daughter's life and for that, he gave him one final chance to walk away with his life if he had agreed that he would not interfere with Vulture's upcoming heist. Toomes gave Parker one final warning that if he chose to pursue him, he would kill him as well as everyone he loved, including Aunt May which terrified Parker.

Parker attending the Homecoming dance
As Parker had begun heading toward the celebration, he was in deep misgivings, as he could stay and be with Liz, which was what he still wanted, but that would mean leaving Vulture to steal Chitauri as well as Ultron based technology from Stark Industries which would mean more weapons being sold in New York City that will inevitably result with innocent people dying. He could pursue Vulture and bring him to justice, but that would mean Liz would lose her father.

Parker telling Liz Toomes that he has to leave
Ultimately, Parker chose his responsibility as Spider-Man. He entered the dance and found Liz with Michelle Jones and Ned Leeds among others, but Parker walked past his friends and straight towards Liz, who assumed her father had threatened him. Parker apologized to Liz, telling her that she deserved better and then left her. Parker then grabbed his original Spider-Man Suit and Web-Shooters that he had stashed beneath the lockers and then ran after Vulture.

Shocker's Ambush

Hastily putting on the original homemade Spider-Man Suit, Spider-Man then ran outside only to be ambushed by Shocker, who had been tasked by Vulture to kill Spider-Man if he had broken their agreement. Spider-Man was unprepared for his presence and was struck directly in the face with some considerable force, with his enemy's attack causing him to lose both of his Web-Shooters, which had put him at a strong disadvantage.

Spider-Man smashes into a school bus
While Shocker mocked his homemade costume, Spider-Man made a desperate attempt to reclaim his Web-Shooters, only for Shocker to use his Gauntlet to knock a school bus into Spider-Man. Shocker was relentless and kept attacking Spider-Man, smashing him through a school bus while commenting on how powerful his Gauntlet was, which Spider-Man fell through the bus and found some gum trapped under the seats which Spider-Man commented were disgusting.

Spider-Man's life is saved by Ned Leeds
As Shocker overturned the bus with another powerful strike from his Gauntlet, Spider-Man was rolled over and crawled out, dazed and in considerable pain from the beatings. On the ground, Spider-Man had questioned why Adrian Toomes had sent him here, to which Shocker replied that he would never know. Before Shocker could strike once again, Spider-Man was saved by the timely arrival of Ned Leeds who managed to stop Shocker's attack with the Web-Shooter.

Spider-Man goes off in pursuit of Vulture
Immediately taking the advantage, Spider-Man defeated Shocker and webbed him against a school bus, leaving him to be arrested by the NYPD. In a haste, Spider-Man had then informed Leeds about Vulture's true identity as Liz Toomes' father and told him that they needed to inform Tony Stark of the situation. As Spider-Man swung away from the scene, he told Leeds to call Happy Hogan and to keep track of his phone so they could still stay within contact.

Spider-Man stealing Flash Thompson's car
Seeking some transportation to get across New York City to find Vulture, Spider-Man found and stopped Flash Thompson who was on his way to the homecoming dance with his date while complaining about the dinner they had just eaten. Spider-Man then stopped Thompson by jumping onto the hood of the car and demanded him to get out of the car and hand over both the keys and his phone, using a gravely deeper voice to appear more intimidating. Despite Thompson insisting that it was his father's car, Spider-Man still then drove away in Thompson's car, briefly crashing into a rack of bikes, much to Thompson's horror.

Spider-Man drives to Vulture's location
While driving, Parker used Thompson's phone to call Leeds, telling him that he left his own phone in Toomes' car for them to track. While Parker continued struggling to drive, Hogan refused to take Leeds' call as he was busy emptying Avengers Tower into the Stark Cargo Plane, at which point Parker realized that was what Vulture had planned to hijack. They then tracked Vulture to his Headquarters as Parker sped towards his location, accidentally crashing the car.

Confronting Vulture
Spider-Man goes in search for Vulture
With the aid of Ned Leeds, Spider-Man was able to quickly track down Adrian Toomes to an old warehouse. He went inside, using his webbing to glide himself down slowly and discovered computers with information all about Avengers Tower and the Stark Cargo Plane, as well as also finding Vulture's Exo-Suit. While still exploring the warehouse, Spider-Man eventually found Toomes waiting for him by his work bench.

Spider-Man finds and confronts Vulture
As Spider-Man questioned if Toomes was surprised to see him alive after sending Shocker to kill him outside the school, Toomes replied calmly said that he admired Spider-Man's determination, noting that he could see why Liz Toomes liked him. As Spider-Man proceeded to use his Web-Shooters to trap Toomes' hand onto the table, he had then demanded to know why Toomes could do all of this to his family; Toomes replied that he was only doing his crimes for them, so as to support them.

Spider-Man listens to Adrian Toomes' reasons
Spider-Man insisted that selling the Chitauri and Ultron weapons on the black market to the criminals like Mac Gargan was wrong, while Toomes countered that men like Tony Stark earned their own fortune with Stark Industries by selling weapons and there was no difference between his crimes and those that Stark had committed. While he had continued talking, Toomes insisted that people like Stark and the rest of the Avengers did not care about working men like them.

Spider-Man dodges Vulture's Exo-Suit
As Spider-Man asked why he was telling him this, Toomes revealed that he wanted him to understand his views and could also remotely control his Vulture's Exo-Suit, as his wings seemingly began attacking Spider-Man. He dodged all of the attacks and taunted Toomes only for him to reply that he was not actually aiming for him. The wings smashed through the last supporting beam of the warehouse and debris collapsed upon Spider-Man. Vulture had then put on his suit and left him to die underneath the rubble.

Parker being trapped underneath the rubble
Beneath the rubble, Parker awoke and discovered that he was now trapped between two large pieces of debris. Unable to move and barely able to breathe, Parker attempted to free himself by mustering all of his strength, and when this failed, the now terrified Parker then desperately cried for someone to help him, only for his plea for help going unanswered, leaving him alone. Struggling and in pain, Parker spotted his Spider-Man Mask in the water and his own reflection.

Spider-Man lifting all the debris off of him
Seeing his reflection and remembering Stark's words to him following the ferry incident, Parker had begun to finally understand what his mentor meant when he took the suit away from him: that with or without the suit, he was the Spider-Man and the power was all his own. Encouraged by this realization, Spider-Man regained his resolve, mustered his stamina, and began to painfully push all the rubble off of him. Finally, he broke free of his entrapment and reclaimed his mask to determinedly pursued Vulture.

Hijacking of the Stark Plane

Upon escaping, Spider-Man managed to find Vulture who stood on the outskirts of the destroyed warehouse keeping a close watch on Avengers Tower. Just as Vulture took off, Spider-Man leapt towards him and webbed onto to him as he flew toward the Stark Cargo Plane which had just taken off with several million dollars worth of equipment. Feeling slight air drag but unaware of Spider-Man's presence, Vulture continued with his hijacking.

As they soared higher and higher, Spider-Man looked down at New York City below as they disappeared through the clouds. When Vulture finally reached the plane, he used the upgrade by Tinkerer and attached himself to crawl into the plane. Spider-Man discovered that his Web-Shooters were completely useless at such high altitudes in the air and while traveling at such fast speeds. With no other recourse, he instead attempted to remove Vulture's Exo-Suit that was covering the hole made into the plane.

Not long after Spider-Man managed to nudge the Exo-Suit, it caused the air to rush into the plane through the Matter Phase Shifter, causing Vulture to learn about his presence and abort his hijacking. Vulture then responded by donning his Exo-Suit and flying around the plane, as Spider-Man commented that his homecoming was anything but typical since he was fighting his date's father as another fierce fight happened in the sky between Spider-Man and Vulture.

Spider-Man almost falls into the plane engine
Lacking his Stark made Spider-Man Suit's advanced capabilities, Spider-Man could only improvise and dodged Vulture's relentless attacks. The fight then resulted in extensive damage to the cargo plane as Spider-Man was almost thrown into one of the plane's engines, although he was able to use his Web-Shooters to block up the blades and save his own life, before then kicking away the engine while Vulture continued to fly around him, ready to attack him once again.
