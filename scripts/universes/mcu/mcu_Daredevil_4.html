Change of Heart
Murdock recovering from all of his wounds
Later, Elektra tended to Murdock's wounds, having removed the poisoned arrow from his shoulder, and ensured that his life was no longer in danger. When Murdock had finally recovered, he looked around and found no evidence of the fight from the previous night. He asked Elektra what she did to the boy's corpse, to which Elektra responded that she took care of everything, implying that she disposed of the body, much to Murdock's shock.

Murdock asks Elektra to leave his apartment
Murdock, still in shock from Elektra's kill, noted that her adrenaline spiked when she killed him, just like at Roscoe Sweeney's house those many years ago. She told Murdock about the first person she killed when she was twelve, not for self-defense, but through pure enjoyment, which had horrified Murdock. He told Elektra that there was a time when he was in love with her, but he would have no more of her killings, as this went against his beliefs. Murdock had then demanded that she leave his apartment, stating that he would fight against the Hand by himself. With that, Elektra reluctantly left.

Murdock tells Foggy Nelson that he is done
Later that day, Foggy Nelson had arrived at the apartment to visit Murdock, taking note of his injuries. Nelson had informed Murdock that he had thought it best that Nelson and Murdock shut down, to which Murdock reluctantly agreed. However, Nelson begged Murdock to quit being a hero, as clearly his life as Daredevil was putting him at risk of being killed, but Murdock told Nelson that he would no longer apologize for who he was and that he would resume the mantle of Daredevil, no matter what Nelson thought. With that, Nelson left him, leaving Murdock with less allies than ever.

Fighting the Hand
The Return of Nobu
Stan Gibson tells Daredevil about the Farm
Later in the Yakatomi Building parking lot, Daredevil located Stan Gibson, taking out his bodyguards.

The tubes went into a huge stone Sarcophagus. Daredevil went to free the children and Hirochi escaped. Gibson entered the Farm and was horrified to see his son in one of the cages. Then, one of the ninjas ambushed Daredevil, letting him know that the draining wasn't complete, as he took out an all too familiar Kyoketsu-Shoge.

Daredevil finds out that Nobu Yoshioka is alive
Daredevil fought the ninja as long as he could, but the ninja became victorious. The ninja pushed the sarcophagus into an elevator; then, Daredevil figured out who the ninja was: Nobu Yoshioka. Daredevil was shocked, stating that he should be dead, however, Yoshioka took off his mask and replied that there was no such thing.

Daredevil offers Brett Mahoney an update
Daredevil went outside of the building and called Brett Mahoney. As soon as he arrived, he told him about the caged children and that they needed medical attention, warning him about the Hand trying to get them. Daredevil told him to take them to Metro-General Hospital and to put them under the care of Claire Temple.

Murdock tells Claire Temple about the Hand
As soon as Mahoney took the kids to Metro General, Murdock met Claire Temple in the hallway.  He warned her that their blood was drained by a ninja named Nobu Yoshioka, who, somehow, came back to life after he burned to death.

The Punisher Escapes
Murdock speaks with Karen Page
Following Frank Castle's escape from Ryker's Island, Murdock was summoned to meet Samantha Reyes along with Karen Page and Foggy Nelson. Upon arriving at the courthouse, Murdock was soon greeted by Page who commented on the amount of security now present there, as Murdock apologized for getting Nelson and Murdock involved with the case in the first place. While Murdock attempted to make small talk with Page, she was called away for security reasons, leaving just standing Murdock alone outside.

Murdock discusses Frank Castle's escape
They were taken through security and then entered Reyes' office. While they walked in they discussed Castle's escape from Ryker's with Murdock asking Page if he had said anything at all to her, but Page insisted he had not mentioned any escape plan. Nelson took note that Castle escaped Cell Block D. Murdock remembered this as the same cell block in which Wilson Fisk was incarcerated, noting that he liked to track of anyone who may want them dead. He then soberly told Page and Nelson that this was not a coincidence, telling them that he believed Fisk orchestrated Castle's escape.

Murdock arrives at Samantha Reyes' office
As they sat down in Reyes' office, she and Blake Tower requested their help in locating Castle. Murdock told her that they would only help if she told them what happened between her and Castle. Reyes confessed that the Massacre at Central Park that killed Castle's family was a sting operation that went south. The District Attorney's office had been trying to convict a mysterious drug dealer known as the Blacksmith. Reyes and Tower explained that while they were tracking him they learned of a deal involving the Blacksmith, Dogs of Hell, Kitchen Irish and Mexican Cartel and decided to act.

Murdock learns about the Punisher's threats
Reyes then revealed that she chose to not clear the park of civilians to make it look less suspicious and risk the Blacksmith getting away, but it resulted in multiple civilian deaths, due to a shootout that broke out between the gangs, with victims including Castle's own wife and children. Then, Reyes showed them an X-ray of a skull that she took from her daughter's backpack, worried Castle had now chosen her own daughter as his next victim. She informed them that although her daughter was safe in a secret location in upstate New York, the Punisher must be found before he could harm anyone else.

Murdock protects Karen Page from gunshots
While Reyes begged them to tell her if Castle ever contacted them, Murdock heard a gun being cocked from across the street, in an instant Murdock then demanded that everyone got down, covering Page with his own body as an unknown assassin began shooting at them. The bullets destroyed everything in sight, wounding Nelson in the arm. Once the bullets stopped hitting the room, everyone slowly raised to their feet. Although almost everyone had survived, they discovered that Reyes had been hit multiple times in the back and was killed, much to Tower's utter shock and horror.

Murdock promises he will find Frank Castle
As a result, the New York City Police Department and the FBI all then swarmed the courthouse, desperately searching for the Punisher who they blamed for the murder. Murdock, Nelson, Page and Tower left the courthouse; as Nelson was being treated by an Emergency Medical Technician, Murdock let him know that he would go after the Punisher and get to the bottom of all this, although Nelson was still skeptical that he would ever be able to find him. Murdock, however, insisted he knew where to start looking, before Nelson noted he may know where to start, but not how to ever stop.

Kingpin's Threat
Murdock is greeted by Benjamin Donovan
Seeking answer directly from his chief suspect, Murdock visited Ryker's Island, where he was greeted by Benjamin Donovan who gave him a contract written in out Braille for Murdock's convenience, stating the terms of the meeting between him and Wilson Fisk. Donovan warned that if Murdock came into physical contact with Fisk or discussed their meeting with the media then he would be sued, Murdock signed the contract and was brought to Fisk.

Murdock meets with Wilson Fisk in prison
Fisk noted how he and Murdock had met once before at the Scene Contempo Gallery before they went to court, but Murdock ignored this and commented on the shooting at the New York State Supreme Court Building which had killed Samantha Reyes. Murdock accused Fisk of setting up Frank Castle's escape, but Fisk told him that it never happened while Murdock argued that Fisk's seeming lack of motive kept the suspicion away from him and allowed him to unleash Castle upon New York City to cause chaos. Fisk decided that enough was enough and called over Donovan to end their meeting.

Murdock is violently attacked by Wilson Fisk
Instead of back down, Murdock threatened to make sure that Fisk's beloved fianc√©e, Vanessa Marianna, could never come back to New York, for acting as his accomplice, ensuring Fisk would never see her again, apart from the odd trip to Morocco but he would never be able to live with her again. Upon hearing that, the now enraged Fisk released himself from his chains attacked Murdock, slamming him into the table. Defending himself, Murdock managed to punch Fisk's mouth, but the still furious Fisk kept ahold of his suit and remembered how Murdock was the son of a boxer.

Murdock leaves the Fisk meeting horrified
Murdock realized that Fisk had taken control of Ryker's Island and had indeed orchestrated Castle's escape, which Fisk then confessed to but noted that nobody would back up Murdock's story. Fisk threatened to get revenge on Nelson and Murdock by destroying the lives and loved ones of Murdock and Foggy Nelson, as soon as he got out. Fisk threw Murdock back onto his seat and promised that his wrath would be worse than anything the Punisher was going to do to the city. Murdock was escorted out of the prison by Donovan, horrified and shaken from what just transpired.

The Invasion of Metro-General
Murdock and Claire Temple the Hand's plans
Murdock went to the rooftop of Metro-General Hospital. Claire Temple met up with him, wondering why he wasn't visiting Foggy Nelson.

Murdock, forlorn, told Temple that he felt everything he did got undone. He told her he was quitting the law and his friends.

Daredevil allows Punisher to do things his way
Again, Castle stated that Daredevil's way of justice didn't help end crime and killing the Blacksmith was the best solution.  Daredevil admitted that his way wasn't working and suggested that just this once, they do things Castle's way. Castle then stated that once someone kills another person, they can never go back from what they did. Daredevil warned Castle about men he heard approaching.  He told Castle they needed to get off the ship, and in response, Castle pushed Daredevil into the water. The men shot at the boat, which exploded from the gunpowder held below decks.
