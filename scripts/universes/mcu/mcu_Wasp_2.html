<html><p>Size Manipulation: Similar to the Ant-Man's suit, van Dyne is able to reduce herself to the size of an insect by using Pym Particles in the belt of the suit to distance her atoms, effectively compacting her physical structure and allowing her to shrink down whenever necessary. She still maintains her regular sized strength and durability while in a reduced scale as the process amplifies the amount of force she can generate and increases her density. Additionally, the process of altering size compresses force and energy, manifesting as brief shockwaves of vibration around the target, which briefly augments her force and momentum as she returns to normal size.
Superhuman Strength: When decreased in size, van Dyne possesses a certain degree of superhuman strength, able to easily overpower enemies when shrunken down. The momentum of her attacks also appears to be increased. As she shrinks and regrows in an instant, the power behind her attacks, combined with her already superhuman strength and combat skills, allow for her to defeat the most skilled of combatants within a fraction of a second.
Superhuman Durability: When decreased in size, van Dyne's body is hyper-compressed, and is much resistant to injury, enough to survive falls from great heights and other impacts that would injure or kill even normal sized humans. She was notably capable of taking blows from the extremely dangerous Ghost.

Enhanced Reflexes: The suit improves van Dyne's reflexes to avoid faster attacks.
Wasp using her wings to fly
Flight: By utilizing four artificial insect-like wings, van Dyne can fly at impressive speeds and maneuver with great agility with ease, as evidenced when a knife was thrown at her while she was shrunken down. She was able to fly from the center of San Francisco to Fisherman's Wharf in a matter of minutes. She can also use the wings at full-size as blunt-force weapons.
Energy Projection: van Dyne can fire bolts of energy from the wrists of her gauntlets. They are powerful enough to blast burning holes in reinforced materials, incapacitate the Ghost mid-phase, and knock a man unconscious. Her gauntlets were later upgraded before the Snap, now able to fire constant streams of concussive energy, powerful enough to push back the likes of Thanos during the Battle of Earth alongside Shuri and Pepper Potts.
Insect Manipulation: Through the use of the EMP Communication Device given to her by her father, van Dyne can use electromagnetic waves to communicate and control insects, primarily ants. The device uses electromagnetic waves to mimic pheromones and stimulate the olfactory nerve center of insect-sized organisms.
Abilities
Genius-Level Intellect: Raised by Hank Pym, Hope is an expert in many fields of science. Hope seemingly carries her own father's passions in chemistry and physics, which explains why she seemed confident in her understanding of the Ant-Man Suit to the point that she thought she could wear it to take down Darren Cross.
Expert Scientist: Hope is a highly skilled scientist, specializing in physics and chemistry.
Expert Businesswoman: Hope's business acumen has risen to the point she was able to secure for herself a stable position in Pym Technologies' board. She possessed enough power in the company to have the deciding vote to remove Hank Pym, the company's founder and CEO, from the company.
Hope van Dyne training Scott Lang in combat
Master Martial Artist: Hope has trained in martial arts since she was a child, training Scott Lang in combat skills and fighting techniques, enabling him to become Ant-Man. Her martial arts prowess came in handy when she finally took the mantle of the Wasp. Hope employs a mixed martial art including elements of muay Thai, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Judo, kickboxing, and aikido.
Master Acrobat: Hope incorporates gymnastics and acrobatics into her fighting style as she battles opponents, notably dodging a knife thrown at her while shrunken, then using it as a platform to continue her assault.

Weapons
Van Dyne aiming her gun at Darren Cross
Glock 17: Van Dyne took one of these guns from one of the security guards holding both her and her father Hank Pym at gunpoint. Van Dyne tried to dissuade Darren Cross from killing her father, but she was disarmed by one of the guards when Ant-Man stormed into the room and disabled the rest of the guards. Despite van Dyne disabled another guard herself, she could not prevent Cross from shooting Pym in the shoulder.
Other Equipment
EMP Communication Device: Earpieces made by Hank Pym that allow Hope to control insects, which she and Pym trained Scott Lang to do.
Wasp Suit: A prototype for an upgraded version of her mother's shrinking suit was given to her by her father so that she could become the new Wasp. Like the Ant Man suit, it can manipulate its wearer's size while simultaneously enhance both the wearerâ€™s density and strength, allowing for her to gain superhuman strength and near-invulnerability when shrunk.

Trivia
In the comics, Hope Pym appears in the MC2 continuity, set in the future of the classic Marvel Universe, and is known as the supervillain Red Queen.
She was later adapted into the main comics continuity as Nadia Pym, daughter of Hank Pym and his first wife, Maria Trovaya, who was taken to the Red Room by the Winter Soldier (at time when he was brainwashed) and raised to become a Soviet agent, ultimately becoming the new iteration of the Wasp after managing to escape from that Room. In Russian, the name Nadia translates to "hope."
