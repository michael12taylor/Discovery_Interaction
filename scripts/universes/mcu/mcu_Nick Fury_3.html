Trivia
Although most of the characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe are based on their mainstream counterparts, this Nick Fury is modeled after his Ultimate version, who is himself modeled after Samuel L. Jackson. The mainstream version of Nick Fury is an Italian American veteran of World War II, who would later be replaced by his illegitimate son, Nicholas Joseph Fury Jr., a character virtually identical to the Ultimate Nick Fury, following the success of the movies.
Coincidentally, in the Ultimate comics, Fury said that if he could choose any actor to portray him on film, he would choose Samuel L. Jackson.
However, the MCU version shares several traits with his mainstream counterpart, such as being a colonel of the United States Army instead of a general, or retaining his blinded eye instead of having actually lost his left eye.

However, the MCU version shares several traits with his mainstream counterpart, such as being a colonel of the United States Army instead of a general, or retaining his blinded eye instead of having actually lost his left eye.
In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the epitaph on Nick Fury's grave says: "THE PATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS MAN... Ezekiel 25:17". That is a reference to Samuel L. Jackson's other role as Jules Winnfield from the movie Pulp Fiction.
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and goodwill, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee."

And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee."
Fury cannot eat toast if it is diagonally cut.
Fury has the same birthday as Steve Rogers.
Behind the Scenes
Samuel L. Jackson was uncredited for his appearances in Iron Man, Thor and Avengers: Infinity War.
The story Fury told about his grandfather in Captain America: The Winter Soldier is actually a true story about Samuel L. Jackson's grandfather.
Samuel L. Jackson's appearance in One Eight Seven was used at the primary reference for Nick Fury's appearance in Captain Marvel.
As he fades during the post-credits scene of Avengers: Infinity War, Fury is in the process of saying the word "motherfucker", which Samuel L. Jackson is known for using in many of his roles. Jackson has credited the word with helping him overcome a stutter he has struggled with for his entire life. In Captain Marvel he says "motherflerken" in the reaction of his eye being scratched by Goose.
During the filming of The Avengers, Samuel L. Jackson showed up unannounced and dressed as Nick Fury in one of the sets of the TV series Breaking Bad, asking to be an extra in one of the scenes set at the Pollos Hermanos restaurants. The series's producers denied his request.
Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the second live-action incarnation of the character, following an incarnation portrayed by David Hasselhoff.
Jon Watts pitched Fury as Peter Parker's mentor in Spider-Man: Homecoming but Tony Stark was chosen instead.
Ousaun Elam, Kiante Elam, Henry Kingi and Curtis J. Stuart were stunt doubles for Samuel L. Jackson in the role of Nick Fury.
Brother Eden Douglas and Qualen Bradley were stand-ins for Samuel L. Jackson in the role of Nick Fury.
Toney Chapman Steele was a body double for Samuel L. Jackson in the role of Nick Fury.
According to Jon Watts, the Spider-Man: Far From Home post-credits scene that revealed that "Nick Fury" was actually Talos was only added after he watched Captain Marvel, as he felt the reveal was the perfect explication to have Fury being fooled by Mysterio, arguing that "[Fury's] super power is being skeptical", yet the film needed the character "to be fooled in order to make the story work".
