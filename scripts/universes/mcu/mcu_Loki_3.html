<html><p>While Loki had remained stuck on the ground while being constantly shocked, the Sakaaran Rebellion was successful, just as Thor had managed to enter Asgard with both Valkyrie and Bruce Banner. Loki was eventually found lying on the ground and was rescued by all the rebels, as Korg turned off the Obedience Disk and invited Loki to join them with stealing the Statesman, which Loki agreed to, noting that Korg and his people looked like they needed his leadership.

Rescuing Asgardians
Loki comes back to the Asgardians' rescue
Loki and the other members of the Sakaaran Rebellion proceeded to take the Statesman and had then made their escape from Sakaar. Loki then took control of the ship and decided to do some good for a change, as they arrived in time to help the Revengers evacuating the surviving Asgardians from Asgard, while they were attempting to escape from Hela. While he appeared from the shadows, Loki delighted with his heroic moment, announcing to the Asgardians that their savior had arrived.

Loki being finally reunited back with Heimdall
While Loki walked through the crowds of Asgardians and questioned if they had missed him, he then reunited with Heimdall who noted that he had seen Loki coming. Standing alongside the remaining Asgardian warriors, as well as Korg and Miek who were leading the Sakaaran rebels, Loki had furiously fought against Hela's incoming armies of Berserkers who were still furiously attempting to stop the Asgardians from boarding the Statesmen to escape from Asgard.

Loki witnesses Thor's new incredible powers
As the battle continued, Loki and the other warriors had then looked up to the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf where a huge blast of lightning had just destroyed much of the front of the Palace and had injured Hela who was in the center of the blast. Loki had then smirked to himself as he watched Thor charge down to the Bifrost Bridge with his incredible new power as lightning engulfed his body, which he used to destroy several of the Berserkers with some considerable ease.

Loki fighting against the armies of Berserkers
Loki continued fighting against the army of Berserkers with his allies while Thor made his way towards him, as they were also joined by Valkyrie who had arrived on the Commodore and had joined in the battle armed with her Dragonfang. Taking whatever advantage he had in the fight, Loki had resorted to using his helmet to knock the Berserkers off their feet and killing them, until eventually, they had pushed the Berserkers back, allowing the Asgardians to escape.

Loki discusses how to finally defeat Hela
Taking a break from the fight, Thor claimed that Loki was late, while Loki noted that Thor was now missing an eye. Seeing Hela was still coming for them, Loki suggested that Thor struck her with a lightning blast, but Thor insisted that this would do nothing to stop her. As Hela was too powerful and cannot be killed, Thor told Loki to revive Surtur to finally kill Hela, but at a cost to have no choice to put Asgard through Ragnarök, as Loki called it a bold move even for him.

Loki flying back towards the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf
Leaving Thor and Valkyrie to him some time to distract Hela by furiously fighting her on the Rainbow Bridge, Loki took control of the Commodore and flew back to the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf, commenting to himself along the way about how completely insane this plan was. With Hela and the Berserkers distracted by their battle against the Revengers, Loki was then able to successfully get into the Palace and charge into Odin's Vault without being seen or challenged.

Loki unites Surtur with the Eternal Flame
Loki immediately grabbed the Crown of Surtur and had prepared to complete his plan; however, just before successfully reviving Surtur with Eternal Flame inside Odin's Vault, Loki had then also managed to quietly get the Tesseract safely away. As the Ragnarök began, the Revengers, along with all surviving Asgardian refugees and Sakaaran Rebels escaped Asgard quickly, while watching Asgard’s destruction and the end of Hela's reign of terror once and for all.

Asgard's Final Days
Making Amends
Loki finally making his amends with Thor
As Thor put his new eyepatch on, Loki remarked his new look as reminiscent to their father's. Thor, believing his brother had already left the ship, jokingly remarked if he was here, he'd give him a hug. Thor threw an object towards him, but Loki caught it quickly and reassured him that he was really here. The two then made their way towards the deck, where Loki witnessed Thor officially becoming the new King of Asgard as he sits on his throne. Thor then decided to remake Asgard on Earth.

Final Stand on the Statesman
Loki listening to Ebony Maw's speech
Traveling for a few months in space en route to Earth, Loki approached Thor to discuss their destination, with the latter uncertain to return there after everything he had done. Out of nowhere, an enormous ship appeared in front of the Statesman.

Loki and the Black Order watch Thor suffer
The ship belonged to Thanos and his Black Order, who boarded the Statesman, massacring half of the ship, with the other half managing to escape. Loki was among those who remained. The Mad Titan demanded that Loki hand over the Space Stone, but attempted to hide the fact that it was in his possession. Now being held at knifepoint by Proxima Midnight, and surrounded by the rest of the Black Order, Thanos began to torture Thor with the Power Stone being pressed against his head.

Loki handing over the Tesseract to Thanos
Threatened with Thor's death, Loki revealed the Tesseract to Thanos, before unleashing Hulk on him, quoting Iron Man from their confrontation in Stark Tower years before. As Hulk charged forward, Loki dropped the Tesseract and lunged to push Thor out of harm's way. However, Hulk was easily overpowered by Thanos and was beaten badly. Once he had been disposed of, Ebony Maw picked up the Tesseract and presented it to Thanos, who crushed it and added the encased Infinity Stone to his Infinity Gauntlet. Thanos then triumphantly ordered the Black Order to go to Earth to obtain the remaining Infinity Stones there.

Loki attempting to kill Thanos with a dagger
Under the pretense of offering himself as a guide to Earth, Loki feigned continuing servitude to Thanos while secretly readying a dagger. Hoping that he had fooled Thanos, Loki attempted to stab his throat, but the Titan easily predicted the move. Thanos stopped the knife with his Infinity Gauntlet and sarcastically mocked Loki for choosing the word "undying" while referring to his false allegiance, rebuking him for not choosing his words wisely.

Thanos crushes Loki's neck
Despite this, Loki remained defiant even though he was now at the mercy of Thanos, and threatened him that he would never succeed in his plans, and would not become a god like he sought to be. This did not faze or anger Thanos at all, and while Thor watched, he calmly crushed Loki's neck. Dropping his broken corpse at Thor's knees, Thanos mocked him by saying that this time, Loki would not be resurrected.

Legacy
Thor's Revenge
Loki's death was mourned by Thor, who cried over his lifeless body while Thanos used his newly acquired Infinity Stones to destroy the Statesman and teleport himself and the Black Order away. Loki's corpse, along with half of the Asgardian population, was then blown up in the Statesman explosion and left floating in the debris left over from the spacecraft. Only Thor, albeit injured both physically and emotionally, had survived the ordeal.

Having fully reconciled with Loki and witnessing his brother's death, Thor condemned him for saving the Space Stone. Knowing that Loki was truly dead, Thor did everything he could to kill Thanos and avenge him. He forged Stormbreaker with the aid of Eitri and in Wakanda wounded Thanos with his new axe. Thor repeated his vow to kill Thanos, but Thanos was too resilient and mocked back that Thor should've aimed for his head. Before Thor could stop him, Thanos managed to snap his fingers with the Infinity Gauntlet.

A few weeks later, however, the surviving Avengers and Guardians went to the Garden and ambushed Thanos on his farm, only to discover in horror that he had destroyed the Infinity Stones. Feeling that Thanos had earned death for his actions, Thor brutally decapitated Thanos with Stormbreaker, killing him and finally avenging Loki's death.

Alternate Timeline Versions
In 2023, the Avengers traveled back in time as part of their Time Heist, creating an alternate 2012 timeline. Their actions inadvertently caused an alternate Loki to abscond with Tesseract in the aftermath of the Battle of New York. Loki was swiftly arrested by the Time Variance Authority, who showed him footage of his original fate had he not escaped from the Avengers in 2012. Loki saw the footage of how Thanos murdered his original timeline self aboard the Statesman, which made him rethink his self-proclaimed glorious purpose in life.

Time Heist
Imprisoned on Asgard
Loki imprisoned in Asgard
In an alternate 2013, just prior to the Sacking of Asgard induced by the Dark Elves, Loki remained in his holding cell in the Asgardian Dungeons as per the original timeline. Loki had began toying with various objects in his cell in a bored manner, oblivious to Thor and Rocket Raccoon from the future, who snuck past him while attempting to obtain the Aether from Jane Foster.

Personality
Loki was an ever-scheming individual; the God of Mischief, he meddled in people's lives and even led them to their inevitable deaths as it made him feel powerful, and often used superior ploys or ulterior designs upon his enemies, such as Thor and the Avengers. Compared to his boisterous older brother, he constantly seemed to be relaxed, peaceful and quiet, but in truth had the mind of a cold, calculating sociopath and was formulating machinations that would achieve his power and respect that he truly believed he deserves at all times. Other than that, Loki supposedly cared for Thor, consoling him after his coronation was ruined but was stated to be envious of him his entire life, although no one knew the extent of such envy until it was too late. He had a deep hatred of Odin and Thor due to supposedly being the least favored son and rejected by Thor himself all the time. Loki would do anything to mortify, defeat or hurt Thor, even enslaving the world he cared for and supposedly taking his own life.

Part of his bitterness stemmed from the fact that he was a Frost Giant and was intended as a political tool to bring peace between Asgardians and Frost Giants. As such, Loki felt alienated and guilty since he was a member of a race Asgardians were taught to fear and hate, and the people he thought were his family fibbed to him about it all his life. Growing up, Loki believed he was an actual prince of Asgard and so genuinely thought he could be king. Loki competed with Thor for Odin's favor, yet once his real parentage was revealed, Loki felt betrayed as he felt a Frost Giant as king was never a feasible possibility. And what’s more, Loki felt that he was viewed as nothing more than a trophy and tool instead of an actual son by Odin despite all evidence to the contrary.

However, deep down, Loki loved his family to some degree. Though his hatred for his brother and father seemed to be unending, he did not share these feelings for his mother Frigga. Upon learning she was killed, Loki acted with madness and eliminated everything within his cell. When he got confronted by Thor in his imprisonment, he asked genuinely if she suffered as she died and was ready to work with his much-hated brother to kill Malekith. Part of this stemmed from his regret over directing Kurse to Frigga and Jane Foster and upon Svartalfheim he displayed tremendous and uncharacteristic selflessness such as risking his own life to save Foster and Thor while dying in the process. Thor even stated that Loki indeed died with honor but even this was a ruse as he has usurped the throne of Asgard and captured Odin. Despite his hatred and contempt, Loki would have expressed the desire to be Thor's equal and recognized by Odin as the worthy son. He seemed to care about the two of them to an extent, particularly Odin, calling the guards and looking on in concern when Odin collapsed on the ground, and while he was hanging onto Thor near the Bifrost, he stated that he wanted to destroy Jotunheim for him. Perhaps, he loved his family deep down as he appeared hesitant to eject Thor out of the Helicarrier, and saved Odin from being murdered by Laufey as he later stated that his death was not his goal, and did not actually kill Odin, but rather imprisoned him on Earth.

But the love he once showed and his more human emotions appeared to be significantly dulled by the time he arrived on Earth, along with the decades of built-up resentment which overshadowed any sliver of humanity Loki might retain. Despite this, however, Loki's time as king of Asgard appeared to have reduced his rivalry with and hatred for Thor and resentment for Odin, as he showed sadness and remorse for Odin's death and even showed visible care for Thor on Sakaar, asking him not to return to Asgard out of possible concern of his adopted brother dying against Hela. He was evidently angry and distraught when Thor ignored his offers to abandon Asgard and join the Grandmaster, saying emotionally that he always had to do it alone. He was also affected when Thor suggested he remain on Sakaar due to his power-hungry nature and seemed saddened when Thor said that their paths had diverged long ago. Ultimately, Loki's newfound love for his brother swayed him to help Thor evacuate the Asgardians, risk his life by personally reviving Surtur, and support Thor's coronation.

He had suppressed his desires for most of his life due to constantly living within Thor's shadow. As such he was capable of presenting himself as timid and meek when in reality he was in possession of supreme megalomaniacal ambitions which he believed he was entitled to more than anyone else, especially Thor whom he viewed as an incompetent fool who would make a terrible King in comparison to himself. As The Other stated, his desires were virtually reminiscent to that of a childish need to always be best; this also made his hatred of Thor an entirely overgrown and impractical sibling rivalry and the entirety of his actions could be intervened as purely attention-seeking, going to horrifying lengths such as the subjugation or destruction of a species, all to impress his father. Indeed, Loki's megalomaniacal desires were foiled by his true objective to stand superior over Thor and crush him completely, proving to Thor that he was his equal and his better, which was all he ever wanted.

As a master of deceit and trickery, Loki utilized his duplicitous nature within combat. Loki was also not above underhanded tactics, such as when Thor offered a hand of peace, Loki deceptively stabbed him in his side. Loki would create feints and appear like running away or surrendering if a fight turned to his disadvantage. For example, when he was at the mercy of Thor on top of the Bifrost Bridge, Loki pathetically begged for his life, yet revealed the act to be just another one of his illusion manipulations and a feint to ambush his brother. However, Loki had a flaw of being arrogant, narcissistic and was in possession of extensive delusions of self-entitlement. This led him into trouble at times as he mocked Hulk within Avengers Tower, calling him a "dull creature" which caused him to be thrashed around like a plaything by the green monster. Later, the same arrogance allowed Doctor Strange sufficient time to teleport Loki away from the New York Sanctum. This overconfidence over his deceptive talents ultimately ended up claiming his life as attempted to smooth talk Thanos into lowering his guard enough to be slain only for the Titan to easily anticipate the attack and inevitable betrayal, having always been the far better deceiver and manipulator, and kill Loki in retaliation.

He had an unfounded superiority over and deep hatred for humans, and this enforced his thinking that he was entitled to rule them; simply because he could, due to mankind's history of following people with power, Loki simply believed that they would view him as a benevolent dictator instead. Added to this, Loki firmly believed that freedom was life's great lie and that no-one was truly free and everyone was oppressed in some way. He went as far to say that humans were created only to be subjugated by superior men and that they craved to have a ruler, claiming that they would be lost and their lives effectively pointless without one to give them their identity. He mocked Thor for his compassion towards humanity and him enslaving Earth would be nothing less than a petty, spiteful attack towards his older brother.

For many years, Loki had no respect for his real heritage and would often contradict himself within this area to whatever situation would require it better. After learning that Laufey was in actuality his biological father, he did not even mention this to him on Jotunheim and later murdered him when he attempted to kill Odin. He called the Frost Giants a "race of monsters" despite already knowing that he was a member of the race himself before unleashing the full power of the Bifrost upon their planet. Effectively ending the war which Thor started and having saved Odin's life, he believed would be paraded as a hero as he apparently could not see the logic that ending an entire race would only make Odin disgust him further. Since learning that he was the son of Laufey, Loki stated that Thor was not his brother at all, ignoring the years that they grew up together entirely and threw this in his face twice. When hanging over the Bifrost, though, he referred to him as "brother", despite having previously disowned him only a few minutes earlier, though this was soon revealed to be an illusion, and another trick to use against Thor. Likewise, after being transported to Earth by the Tesseract he claimed himself as "Loki of Asgard" but on Svartalfheim before the Dark Elves, proclaimed himself "Loki of Jotunheim".

The Battle of New York traumatized Loki, since his defeats at the hands of Hulk left him terrified about the creature, to the extent of trying to leave Sakaar upon discovering that Hulk was the champion of their Contest of Champions. Despite this, Loki showed to be capable of using him, as when he, Thor and Valkyrie plotted how to get Thor out of Sakaar, Loki suggested to use Hulk. When the Statesman came under attack by Thanos, however, the two had formed enough of a partnership to improvise a coordinated attack on the Mad Titan. Indeed Bruce Banner would later insist on referring to the New York invasion as Thanos' doing instead of Loki's, emphasizing how the two had come to terms.

Shortly after Odin died and Thor learned the truth about Hela and how Asgard really rose to power, Loki genuinely felt sympathetic towards Thor as he had just found out that everything he knew was false, much like how Loki himself did after finding out he was a Frost Giant. After the destruction of Asgard, Loki and Thor seem to have fully reconciled. However, Loki still kept some of his mischiefs as he stole the Tesseract from Odin's Vault before Asgard’s destruction. Ultimately, though, seeing Thanos on the brink of killing Thor, Loki gave up the Tesseract, despite the fact that it allowed the Titan to be one step closer to conquering the universe, showing his love for his brother had now far surpassed any desire for power that Loki had, but Loki did so in an attempt to assassinate Thanos. Unfortunately for Loki, Thanos easily anticipated this and killed him.

An often remarked flaw of Loki's was that he not only lacked conviction but often failed to appreciate the long term consequences his actions might have as stated by Phil Coulson and Iron Man shortly before the Battle of New York. This was seen again following his usurping of Odin's throne as his decadent leadership caused most of the Nine Realms to fall into chaos and unintentionally precipitated Hela's release. This period of total power had also given him a sense of complacency to the point where most everyone he came across had come to anticipate all of his potential tricks and betrayals. Indeed, Thor openly mocking this attitude was a deciding factor in Loki's decision to reform his ways and genuinely aid his people.

In the final moments of his life, Loki displayed that he truly came to accept both his Asgardian heritage and his Frost Giant parentage, proudly identifying himself as "Odinson" and the "rightful king of Jotunheim". Though having lived in fear of Thanos since their first meeting, Loki selflessly attempted to slay the Titan in spite of his power and entourage, showing he had truly redeemed himself. When Thanos effortlessly parried the attack and began choking Loki to death, Loki not only accepted his fate but remained openly defiant, ridiculing Thanos that he would never achieve true godhood. In the end, Loki died doing what many believed he would never do: display open care for others and reconcile with and accept his lineage.

Powers and Abilities
As a Frost Giant, Loki possessed superhuman attributes such as abnormal strength, speed, agility, durability, stamina, and reflexes and had been shown to be a powerful combatant. He learned to use Asgardian sorcery from Frigga, which, in addition to his cunning, manipulative and strategic mind, made Loki one of the most dangerous foes an individual could ever face in battle. Thor told Doctor Strange that Loki is "a worthy inclusion" to the latter's watchlist of individuals and beings from other realms that may be a threat to Earth.

Powers
Loki's true nature as a Frost Giant
Frost Giant Physiology: Since Loki had been enchanted to look like an Asgardian, Loki's Frost Giant features only came out when he was in contact with Frost Giant magic, such as when he utilized the Casket of Ancient Winters or when he was afflicted with the Frost Giants' touch. Though he is surpassed in physical capabilities by Asgardians, he can easily overpower grown men such as Tony Stark and keep up with enhanced individuals such as Captain America.

Superhuman Strength: Loki possessed considerable superhuman strength, allowing him to overpower multiple S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and Captain America with little effort, easily defeat multiple Frost Giants, Dark Elves and Berserkers, effortlessly lifted Tony Stark off his feet and threw him, and even handled an Infinity Stone without being harmed. He threw one of his knives with enough force to break through a Frost Giant's ice weapon. However, Loki's strength is still outclassed by that of Thor, the Hulk, and Thanos. Although he was able to fight Valkyrie on nearly equal grounds by matching her strength with his own skill, speed, and agility before she overpowered him, he was completely unable to resist Thanos, who effortlessly overpowered and lifted him off his feet with no strain even as Loki struggled to break free. He was also unable to fight Hulk, who effortlessly lifted him off his feet and repeatedly pummeled and defeated him within seconds. When wielding the Scepter, which contained an Infinity Stone, and Gungnir, Loki managed to go toe-to-toe with a Mjolnir-wielding Thor in a fight, albeit he was ultimately defeated even when Thor was holding back.
Superhuman Durability: Loki had shown himself to be highly resistant to physical harm, further augmented by his armor. Hence, Loki only flinched after getting shot in the face multiple times with a handgun and was not at all affected by assault rifle rounds to his torso. Loki also barely reacted to a jab to the face from Captain America, and even a full force kick to the face from the latter that made Loki stumble back only hurt him slightly. He could even withstand the explosion of the energy of the Rainbow Bridge with no damage. However, sufficiently powerful weapons, such as Iron Man's repulsors, Hawkeye's explosive arrows, and a deflected shot from his own Scepter, were at least able to cause Loki pain and leave minor marks. Loki's durability was implied to be far greater than that of a normal Frost Giant, as he was able to take multiple mighty blows from Valkyrie, and even Hulk and Thor without any fatal damage. In addition, as a Frost Giant, Loki was immune to the extreme cold of Jotunheim. He also managed to safely touch the Tesseract without being harmed and even endure Thanos's grip on his neck long enough to defiantly threaten him that he will never be a god, although he quickly died. However, Loki's endurance and durability were shown to be considerably lesser than that of Thor, as seen when Loki was completely wiped out by Hulk's attack, yet Thor managed to recover from the same attack moments later, without any visible injuries and this was later shown when Thor survived being badly beaten and even having his head squeezed by Thanos while Loki was easily killed by Thanos when he snapped his neck without any effort. He could also survive in the vacuum of space unfazed.
Loki catching Hawkeye's explosive arrow
Superhuman Speed: Loki's inferior strength compared to Thor was compensated for his superhuman speed; he was fast enough to catch Hawkeye's arrow in mid-flight, inches away from his neck. He also used his speed in his fight against Captain America, during which he easily gained the upper hand, even smashing Captain America's Shield to the ground. Loki's speed even allowed him to contend with stronger opponents, such as Valkyrie and Thor, by outmaneuvering them, though he still ultimately lost such fights and Thor was holding back against Loki each and every time they fought and once Loki angered his brother in their second fight, Thor was able to easily catch Loki off-guard and beat him without Loki being able to react, implying Loki's speed is inferior to Thor when Thor held nothing back. Loki was also fast enough to tackle his brother out of the way before Hulk ambushed Thanos.
Superhuman Agility: Loki had shown immense agility and reflexes, defeating several Dark Elves at once by using swift and agile movements, and keeping up with the stronger Valkyrie for the majority of their fight with his agility, though Loki was ultimately defeated and chained up, as well as going toe-to-toe with Thor, albeit Thor was holding back, despite the latter's own great agility and fighting ability, in both of their fights.
Superhuman Stamina: Loki possessed superhuman stamina that allowed him to fight prolonged battles.
Superhuman Reflexes: Loki possesses superhuman reaction time and reflexes. During the Battle of New York, Loki he managed to catch an arrow shot by Hawkeye when it was in the mid-flight without looking.
Regenerative Healing Factor: Despite his astounding resistance to injury, it was still possible to injure or even kill Loki. However, due to his Frost Giant physiology, Loki healed at a rate much faster than that of humans. Hence, Loki was quickly recovered back on his feet even after being brutally smashed multiple times against the ground by Hulk.
Longevity: Loki had the capacity to live for thousands of years. He was a baby in 965 A.D. and lived up to 2018 while retaining a younger appearance.
Ice Manipulation: Not long after learning of his Jotun blood, Loki discovered an ability to create and manipulate ice, which he used to freeze the Bifrost in place when trying to destroy Jotunheim.
Cold Immunity: Due to his Frost Giant physiology, Loki was immune to the otherwise cold and damaging touch of Frost Giants. He was unharmed when Raze grabbed him, whereas Volstagg was injured by the physical contact from a Jotunn. In fact, both a Frost Giant's touch and his, either using or even touching the Casket of Ancient Winters, would reveal his true form as a Frost Giant.
Master Sorcerer: Loki learned how to wield Asgardian magic while growing up in Asgard, thanks to his adoptive mother Frigga. He eventually became an extremely skilled and formidable sorcerer, with it being his main asset in battle, though other exceptionally skilled sorcerers, like Doctor Strange could contend with him. Even Odin was impressed by Loki's magical skills and noted that Frigga would have been proud of him.

Loki creates an illusion to trick his enemies
Illusion Manipulation: Loki could generate extremely detailed images from outside himself, which are perceptible in the external world, sometimes with a gesture. His holographic illusions could be projected across entire rooms, which allowed him to disguise the fact that he was disheveled and had destroyed his cell in the Asgardian Dungeons in anger over Frigga's death, though Thor was able to deduce the illusion quickly. However, Loki most notably conjured up the extremely convincing illusion of him seemingly dying from a wound inflicted by Kurse.
Duplication Casting: Loki could recreate an exact facsimile of one's own body, which acted as a true holographic mirror of its molecular structure in its present circumstance. He was particularly noted to fool enemies who try to attack him with an illusion of himself. These projections cannot interact with the environment and when someone attempts to interact with it, they will phase through it and the projections will give a green glow around wherever it was touched. Thor was noted to fall for this ability numerous times. Loki can even produce multiple images of himself appear simultaneously during a duel with Thor before the latter blasted them away with a blast of lightning. He could also use this ability to project himself into other locations, similarly to astral projection, through which he can perceive and communicate with others. He may have used this method to speak Thor when the latter was imprisoned by Phil Coulson after failing to pick up his hammer, instantly appearing in and then disappearing from the sealed room Thor was kept in. While in possession of the Scepter, Loki could project himself far across the universe to speak with The Other and was able to feel when the latter touched his projection’s face. Whilst Thor was imprisoned on Sakaar, he would send an illusion of himself to try and convince Thor to work with him in his future scheme to betray the Grandmaster. Being more wary of his brother’s duplicitous antics, Thor managed to recognize Loki leaving a decoy of himself in his place as the pair were walking side by side while he attempted to sneak away from him.
Presence Concealment: Loki was able to render himself and others unseen and unheard to whomever he wanted. This effect could be achieved both through him creating the illusion of letting light waves pass through himself or as simply a trick of the mind, similar to hypnosis. He could even mask his presence from the all-seeing Heimdall himself while he was in Jotunheim, sneak several Frost Giants into Asgard without Heimdall's notice, and hide from S.H.I.E.L.D. agents when he briefly visited Thor and attempted to lift Mjølnir himself. Also, he appeared as a reflection in a mirror without being present in a room, while no one noticed him, as he even spoke aloud and neither Erik Selvig nor Nick Fury heard him, though this may have been at least partly accomplished through the use of the Scepter to astrally project himself to the location as he subliminally influenced Selvig. Using two illusory decoys of himself, one to lure Thor into the holding cell on the Helicarrier previously containing him and another to distract Thor and Phil Coulson, Loki managed to lurk behind the latter despite otherwise being in full view of Thor before fatally stabbing Coulson and revealing himself.
Shapeshifting: Loki was able to alter his attire, his voice, and his physical appearance in order to resemble another person or animal. When Loki uses this power on an entire person, the light generated is green, whereas if it is used on only part of a person or their clothing, the light appears yellow. He used this power to change his clothing from his usual armor to a human's business suit, and back to his battle armor. He was also capable of imitating Thor, Captain America, Odin, and an anonymous Asgardian guard. Loki's shapeshifting was so skilled that even as a child, he was able to transform himself into a snake to trick Thor, with his disguise being convincing enough to allow Thor to pick him up and hold him without arousing suspicion. He can also change others appearances as he briefly turned Thor into a frog as well as making him look like Lady Sif, and later on, to appear as if he had been stabbed, beaten and missing a hand when tricking Malekith into thinking that he had attacked Thor. Loki's shapeshifting also allowed him to generate weapons and armor as well, such as when he turned himself into an Asgardian Guard, he generated a spear and armor. Loki also used this power to generate a dagger in an attempt to assassinate Thanos. Loki's shapeshifting could not free him of any restraints placed upon him, as when he transformed into Captain America to mock him, Loki's hands were still bound, although he made it appear that the restraints had vanished.
Mental Manipulation: Loki could subtly influence the minds of others, such as when he manipulated Erik Selvig into researching the Tesseract, making him repeat his words and thoughts as if they were his own. Later, Loki was even able to cast such a spell on Odin himself, which induced the All-Father to stay on Midgard while Loki usurped his Asgardian throne for four years, though it should be noted that the spell's effects were ultimately not permanent and Odin was able to break the spell shortly before Ragnarök, and only choose to remain in exile due to his impending death. Loki's illusions could also take the form of entire vivid visions, such as when he notably forced Valkyrie to relive her day of defeat against Hela by placing his hand on her head, something he was able to perceive.
Loki conjuring the Tesseract out of his hand
Conjuration: Loki was able to cause objects to appear or disappear according to his will, oftentimes those he had previously acquired. When Heimdall was about to attack him, Loki quickly summoned the Casket of Ancient Winters to use against him, then made it disappear with a wave of his hands. He also appeared to be able to summon his dual daggers out of thin air when threatening Doctor Strange. Later, he used this ability to summon a dagger to throw at Hela while in the  Bifrost. Finally, he used this ability to make the Tesseract appear in his hand when presenting it to Thanos.
Telekinesis: Loki was influence objects and move matter with mere gestures and focus. Upon hearing of Frigga's death, Loki, in a fury, clenched his fists and sent nearly everything around the cell flying through the air and crashing into the walls, which also shook the cell violently like a small tremor, causing the light in it to flicker like an electromagnetic pulse.
Abilities
Genius-Level Intellect: Loki was very intelligent, particularly in the fields of sorcery, tactics, manipulation, and deception, ranking as among the most intelligent individuals in the universe, being highly formidable even without using his powers or combat skills but simply through sheer intelligence, although while holding incredible intelligence, he was still way surpassed by someone as intelligent as Thanos's, with the latter thus easily completely deceiving and manipulating Loki into becoming his henchmen without him even realizing it for a long time and Loki would ultimately meet his true end when he attempted to fool and kill Thanos, who easily outsmarted Loki yet again, casually deflecting Loki's assassination attempt and then killing him without Loki being able to use his intelligence to survive the encounter. Also, Loki was initially noticeably superior to Thor in intelligence, repeatedly outsmarting him, but Thor would eventually manage to anticipate and outsmart Loki. Hence, despite lacking scientific expertise, he was able to understand and eventually utilize alien technologies with great proficiency, such as when he used a Midgard eye remover on Heinrich Schafer, when learned to use the control console that controlled the cage on Nick Fury's Helicarrier, and when he piloted both a Chitauri and Sakaaran airships. One of Loki's biggest achievements was successfully outsmarting and killing the almost invincible and vastly stronger Kurse, whom Loki tricked into letting him get close enough to activate his opponent's own Black Hole Grenade, a strategy which neither Kurse saw through until it was too late or Thor had thought of who unsuccessfully attempted to beat him hand-to-hand.
Master Tactician: Loki was a crafty genius in orchestrating cunning schemes, that had earned him the title of 'God of Mischief'. Hence, Loki successfully orchestrated the events that lead to the banishment and death of Thor, by making Laufey and the Frost Giants attack Asgard during Thor's coronation, only to betray them and gain Asgard's throne. He later allowed himself to be captured by the Avengers and had his brainwashed ally Hawkeye attack Nick Fury's Helicarrier, and provoke Hulk into a rage, thereby freeing himself and separating the superhero team. Later, Loki helped Thor in the latter's attempt to destroy the Reality Stone by pretending to betray him in full view of Malekith and Kurse, thereby momentarily gaining the Dark Elves' trust. Shortly thereafter, Loki successfully faked his own death, cast a hypnosis spell against Odin, and finally usurped the Asgardian throne for four years. After later being marooned on Sakaar, Loki managed to gain the Grandmaster's trust with relative ease. However, his incredible tactical abilities are still far surpassed by Thanos, as the latter was able to easily anticipate Loki's attempt to assassinate him and then successfully finish him off for good.
Loki stabbing Thor with a dagger in combat
Expert Combatant: While Loki was far more interested in sorcery than Asgardian warrior arts, he had still proven to have received highly extensive combat training that makes him a surprisingly formidable fighter in both armed and hand-to-hand combat. His skills had allowed him to effortlessly defeat and kill several S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives in mere seconds, to easily kill several Frost Giants in Jotunheim, to easily slay multiple Dark Elves at once, using only a dagger, to defeat many Berserkers, and to roughly overpower the extremely skilled Captain America in a duel, although the latter proved to have more combat skills than that of his own. He has even been able to hold his own well against the stronger Valkyrie (through his superior agility), and even Thor on several occasions, who were among the most skilled warriors in Asgard's history, though Thor later admitted to having held back against his adopted brother.
Knife Mastery: Loki was highly proficient with knives, able to easily kill several Frost Giants and Dark Elves with a single dagger. He was also a skilled knife-thrower, as he accurately threw a knife into a Frost Giant as well as some of his blades into the necks of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.
Spear Mastery: Loki was extremely skilled in fighting with a spear, as he was able to contend with Thor using Mjølnir wielding Gungnir in their ferocious duel. He also wielded the Scepter with devastating efficiency, effortlessly killing many S.H.I.E.L.D operatives and once again going toe-to-toe with Thor using his hammer.
Expert Marksman: Loki was a skilled marksman who could wield different types of weapons with great accuracy. He used Gungnir to shoot and kill his father, Laufey. After being given the Scepter by Thanos, Loki used it to fire energy blasts with devastating accuracy. During the Destruction of Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. and the Battle of New York Loki shot air crafts out of the sky with only one shot using the Scepter. Loki was also skilled in knife throwing. During the Attack on Jotunheim and Destruction of Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. Loki killed several Frost Giants and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents by throwing knives at them. Loki was able to gun down several Sakaaran Guards with a Sakaaran Laser Rifle with little effort during the Escape from Sakaar despite not being known to use a gun.
Pilot: Loki was a capable pilot, claiming to be better than Thor, able to effectively fly numerous alien spaceships, including a Chitauri Chariot, an Asgardian Skiff and the Commodore by himself.
Multilingualism: Loki was capable in speaking fluent Asgardian, Norwegian, Latin, and English.
Equipment
Weapons
Loki threatens Doctor Strange with his blades
Blades: In battle, Loki often used knives or daggers to injure and kill his enemies, though he was also proficient with a spear. He once had throwing blades that glowed when in use, which allowed him to kill attacking Frost Giants with a single throw. He used what appeared to be the throwing blades to kill S.H.I.E.L.D. agents when he first came for the Tesseract. As for the Second Dark Elf Conflict, he was seen using a single dagger to kill multiple Dark Elves. Loki also used a dagger during his attempt to assassinate Thanos.
Gungnir: When taking over the throne, Loki was seen wielding Odin's spear, which could fire intense beams of energy that could kill easily mortals or Frost Giants, and injure Asgardians.
Casket of Ancient Winters: Loki took possession of the Casket during his brief rule over Asgard, demonstrating being able to make it appear and disappear with a wave of his hands in a warped, swirling blur of motion, as seen when he used the casket to freeze Heimdall.
Destroyer: In an attempt to destroy Thor and ensure that his schemes were not exposed, Loki summoned the Destroyer and sent it down to Puente Antiguo to kill his brother. Loki controlled the Destroyer while sat on his throne within the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf and ordered it to kill Thor by striking his mortal body, however, this inadvertently proved Thor to be worthy and allowed him to regain his powers, resulting in Thor obliterating the Destroyer.
Loki using the Scepter to destroy a Quinjet
Scepter: When arriving at Earth for the second time, Loki wielded the Scepter, given to him by Thanos that was capable of firing destructive energy bolts, as it contained the Mind Stone. By touching the scepter to the chest of a person, Loki was capable of twisting the person's loyalties towards him while retaining their normal personality, doing so to both Hawkeye and Erik Selvig upon his arrival.
Tesseract: The Tesseract is a crystalline cube-shaped containment vessel for the Space Stone, one of the six Infinity Stones that predate the universe and possesses unlimited energy. Loki used the Tesseract to open a wormhole and allow the Chitauri to invade New York City. Following the Battle of New York, the Tesseract was acquired by Loki's brother Thor, who brought the Tesseract back with him to Asgard. After Loki usurped the throne and disguised himself as Odin, he charged Heimdall with treason, forcing the gatekeeper to flee, while the Tesseract was placed within Odin's vault once more. During the destruction of Asgard, Loki noticed the Tesseract and took it for himself before the vault, along with the planet, were destroyed. Loki later lost the Tesseract to Thanos who destroyed it to obtain the Space Stone.
Black Hole Grenade: The Black Hole Grenade is a weapon mainly used by the Dark Elves that creates a miniature gravitational singularity. This weapon type was used again in the infiltration of Svartalfheim, where Loki planted one on Algrim that was likely held by Algrim prior to that event, killing him in the process.
Sakaaran Laser Rifle: Loki and Thor used these rifles to fight the Grandmaster's guards during their escape plot.
Other Equipment
Asgardian Armor: During his time as royalty in Asgard, Loki's primary set of armor consisted of green tunic overlaid with golden metal. It occasionally came with a green cape.
Horned Helmet: Loki possessed a golden horned helmet as a protective headgear and to represent the Asgardian magic he wielded. Loki wore the helmet during his time as Prince and King of Asgard up until his presumed demise in the aftermath of the Duel at the Rainbow Bridge. Following his arrival on Earth, Loki continued to wear the helmet throughout the Chitauri Invasion, particularly during the Skirmish in Germany and the Battle of New York. When Ragnarök fell upon Asgard, Loki wore the helmet again when he led the Sakaaran Rebellion in evacuating the surviving Asgardians onto the Statesman. Loki also used the helmet as a melee weapon against the Berserkers during the Battle of the Rainbow Bridge.
Asgardian Collar: Following his defeat in the Battle of New York, Thor muzzled Loki's mouth with an Asgardian collar to temporarily prevent him from speaking.
Crown of Surtur: Following the defeat of Surtur, Loki was brought the crown of the Fire Demon by Thor while Loki was still disguised as Odin, although Loki mistook the Crown for being Surtur's skull. During their battle against Hela, Loki was personally tasked by Thor with taking the crown down into Odin's Vault and combining it with the Eternal Flame, allowing Surtur to be reborn and destroy both Asgard and Hela.
Eternal Flame: Seeking a way to destroy Hela once and for all before she enslaved the Nine Realms, Loki combined the Eternal Flame with the Crown of Surtur, allowing the Fire Demon to be reborn and destroy Hela, along with all of Asgard while Loki and the Asgardians made their escape.
Vehicles
Jeep: During the Destruction of Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S., Loki stole the Tesseract and brainwashed Clint Barton and Erik Selvig into serving him. The three of them fled the scene in a Jeep they stole with Loki sitting in the back.
Chitauri Chariot: In an attempt to escape from Thor in the middle of the Battle of New York, Loki caught a ride on a Chitauri Chariot, which he rode throughout New York City, firing down on the innocent people below him. When Loki attempted to shoot down Black Widow, who had also caught a ride on a Chariot, Loki was then shot at by Hawkeye, only for the arrow to explode, destroying the Chariot and injuring Loki.
Dark Elf Harrow: Loki along with Thor and Jane Foster commandeered an abandoned Harrow left behind by the Dark Elves following Malekith's attack on Asgard. The three of them used the ship to reach the city's outer limits before switching to an Asgardian Skiff.

Asgardian Skiff: While escaping from the Asgardian Dungeons with Thor, Loki was pushed out of a Dark Elf Harrow and onboard a Skiff which was being piloted by Fandral. Loki then took up the controls of the Skiff and piloted it through a portal which led himself, Thor and Jane Foster into Svartalfheim.
Statesman: During the Escape from Sakaar, Loki had encountered Korg along with the other members of the Sakaaran Rebellion and together they stole the Statesman, which they used to get to Asgard and assist with the evacuation of the Asgardians before they could all be slaughtered by Hela; however, the Statesmen was later attacked and destroyed by Thanos.
Commodore: As time ran out during their clash against Hela, Loki was tasked with resurrecting Surtur to end the battle, so Loki took the Grandmaster's Commodore in order to get inside the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf as quickly as possible to complete his task. When Surtur was resurrected, Loki escaped the dying Asgard in the Commodore, eventually finding and docking with the Statesman.
Facilities
Royal Palace of Valaskjalf: As a Prince of Asgard, Loki resided in the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf along with the other members of the Asgardian Royal Family. During his time as King of Asgard, both when Odin fell into the Odinsleep and when Loki impersonated Odin himself, Loki got to sit in the palace's throne room to rule over Asgard.
Loki's Hideout: Having stolen the Tesseract from S.H.I.E.L.D. and enthralled several operatives, including Clint Barton, into his service, Loki established a hideout on Earth to harness the powers of the Tesseract and open a portal for his Chitauri army to come and launch their invasion.
New York Sanctum: To be added
Grandmaster Palace: Upon arriving on Sakaar, Loki befriended the planet's ruler known as the Grandmaster, who invited him to stay on Sakaar in his luxurious residence. Weeks later, while enjoying a party given at the palace, Loki discovered that his brother Thor had also been sent on Sakaar by Hela. Initially, Loki was willing to help the Grandmaster capture Thor, but later joined the Revengers in an attempt to escape from Sakaar. Loki tried to betray Thor once again, but Thor outsmarted him and left him in the palace's garage, where Loki was later found by the members of the Sakaaran Rebellion.
