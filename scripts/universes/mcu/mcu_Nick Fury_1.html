Nicholas Joseph "Nick" Fury is a world-renowned spy, former Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and founder of the Avengers. Fury began his career within the United States Army in the late 1960s, rising to the rank of Colonel before his honorable discharge. He later became a CIA operative during the Cold War, primarily operating in Soviet territory. Continuing to serve his country, Fury joined S.H.I.E.L.D. to fight against Earth's most dangerous enemies. The great scope of enemies widened in the 1990s as Fury met Vers, helping her uncover her human heritage as Carol Danvers, as the two fought off the Starforce, which was led by Yon-Rogg, as they were targeting Skrull refugees. Fury took a liking to Goose who scratched him for violating her space and permanently blinded Fury's left eye. Fury kept the reason for this injury secret, telling others it was classified but happened in the line of duty, while Danvers had then left the Earth in order to find a new home for the Skrulls and protect the rest of the universe. 

Later promoted to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. by Alexander Pierce, Fury refocused his efforts over the next 15 years to organize the Avengers Initiative, with Fury's true intentions were to bring together any other powerful individuals to assist S.H.I.E.L.D. with protecting the Earth from extraterrestrial threats, which he had only learned of following his encounters with the Kree and Skrulls. Despite some more considerable reluctance from World Security Council who had not believed in his theories, Fury had still continued his efforts and eventually managed to recruit both Iron Man and Captain America into their Initiative, ready for an incoming invasion.

With the Avengers ready, Fury was forced to call them all into action when the Earth was invaded by Loki, who managed to brainwash an army and steal the Tesseract. With the Avengers assembled, Fury took charge of the hunt for Loki, leading the volatile team through the mission as they attempted to learn what Loki's plan for the Tesseract was and who he had been working for. This all then came to a head following Loki killing Phil Coulson, before being tracked to New York City. There, all the Avengers engaged Loki and his entire incoming army of Chitauri in a final battle, with Fury keeping the World Security Council from nuking the entire city before Loki was defeated and the Avengers were disassembled.

Following the Avengers's victory, Fury recruited Captain America as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, while Fury worked on the new Project Insight, as a means of accurately predicting threats; something which conflicted with Rogers' ideals. However, when Fury began to suspect that something was wrong with Project Insight, he then found himself becoming a target of the Winter Soldier, forcing Fury to fake his own death and go into hiding. With limited people he could trust, Fury then turned to Captain America along with Black Widow, the Falcon and Maria Hill to lead the fight, as he soon discovered that HYDRA had secretly managed to infiltrate S.H.I.E.L.D. and Alexander Pierce was the leader, as Captain America had also learned that the Winter Soldier was actually his friend Bucky Barnes who had been brainwashed by HYDRA for decades, following Barnes' apparent death in 1945.

Once Fury and his allies had stopped Project Insight and also killed Pierce, Fury chose to go into hiding to continue hunting down the remaining HYDRA cells. Fury then assisted the now resurrected Phil Coulson in defeating John Garrett while also stopping his plans for Project Deathlok. Following this, Fury chose to promote Coulson to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., telling him to rebuild it from the ground up. Fury had then also aided the Avengers during the Ultron Offensive, serving as support during the Battle of Sokovia. There, he commanded the rebuilt Helicarrier, which Coulson's new S.H.I.E.L.D. secretly worked on.

In 2018, now operating underground with a hand-picked crew, Fury was one of the trillions of victims in the Snap but had managed to send a distress signal to Captain Marvel before his death. In 2023, Fury was resurrected by Hulk in the Blip and attended Tony Stark's funeral alongside the other Avengers after he sacrificed his life in the Battle of Earth. Fury was then made aware of Peter Parker's identity as Spider-Man and was tasked with delivering the E.D.I.T.H. glasses to him. However, deciding to take a vacation in space on Talos' flagship, Fury tasked Talos and Soren to impersonate himself and Maria Hill respectively on Earth and to deliver the glasses to Spider-Man on his behalf. After discovering that Talos and Spider-Man had been involved in a crisis in Europe, Fury decided to end his vacation and return to work.

Biography
Early Life
Childhood in Alabama
Nicholas Joseph Fury was born in Huntsville, Alabama on July 4, 1950. All throughout his childhood, Fury had insisted on only ever being addressed by his surname, even making his mother call him Fury, which he continued to insist for the rest of his life. During his childhood, Fury had his first pet, a cat named Mr. Snoofers.

Military & Espionage Career
United States Army
Once he finished high school, Fury joined the United States Army, working his way up the ranks as a soldier until being promoted to Colonel. Afterwards, he left the military and joined the CIA to pursue a career in espionage.

Cold War
By the 1970s, Fury had a lot of action in Soviet territory, particularly Belfast, Belgrade, Budapest and Bucharest, constantly moving around the world due to the ongoing conflict of the Cold War. Fury chose to be dispatched in those locations, due to them all starting with the letter 'B' and that he could make them rhyme when he would mention them in passing.

Joining S.H.I.E.L.D.
Fury's S.H.I.E.L.D. badge, issued in 1988
Fury joined S.H.I.E.L.D. by the 1980s and was working under Keller's command by 1988. For six years since 1989, he had been working a desk job in a S.H.I.E.L.D. office, attempting to locate and hunt down future enemies. By 1995, he had Level 3 S.H.I.E.L.D. clearance. Over time, Fury oversaw the training of Phil Coulson and John Garrett as their Supervising Officer.

Kree-Skrull War
Encountering Extraterrestrials
Agent Fury first introducing himself to Vers
In 1995, Fury and a group of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents received a call from a LAPD security officer about a mysterious woman who crashed into a store in Los Angeles. 

Fury and Coulson engage in pursuit of Vers
The following morning, Fury interrogated the suspect. He proceeded to ask the woman if she was aware of someone who had fallen into a Blockbuster. Vers then claimed that she was from the Kree planet Hala and warned Fury that the Skrulls had infiltrated his planet. As an incredulous Fury asked for her credentials, however, a Skrull started shooting at them. Vers started chasing after the Skrull, while Fury alerted the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to chase after Vers and the Skrull.

Fury realizes "Coulson" is a Skrull impostor
The chase led him to follow a metro transit train across Los Angeles alongside Phil Coulson, where Vers was in pursuit of the Skrull. Fury and Coulson both kept tabs on Vers, watching as she fought the Skrull atop the train, and narrowly avoiding falling debris on several occasions. During the chase, however, Fury received a message from Coulson, who claimed he was stranded at the shopping complex while doing damage control. 

Fury showing his S.H.I.E.L.D. identification
Fury realized that Vers was telling the truth, and deduced that the Coulson riding shotgun next to him was a Skrull impostor. The Skrull, now aware that Fury had uncovered his deception, attempted to choke him to cover his infiltration. During the scuffle, Fury hard turned the car they were riding in to be t-boned by an incoming bus, which killed the Skrull on impact. Upon seeing the alien's true form, Fury quickly covered the Skrull's body and marked the scene of the accident under S.H.I.E.L.D. investigation and analysis.

Interrogating Vers
Fury takes orders from "Keller" to follow Vers
Following his encounter with the Skrulls, Fury marked the incident under S.H.I.E.L.D. investigation, and contacted Keller, unaware that at this point Talos had impersonated him. Fury was summoned to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Field Office by 'Keller', and as they observed the corpse of the dead Skrull, Fury informed 'Keller' of Vers whom he had encountered earlier, and was authorized to work undercover with her.

Fury being questioned by Vers about his past
Fury tracked down Vers after learning she stole a motorcycle, and followed her to Pancho's Bar. Once he arrived at Pancho's Bar, Fury confronted Vers and proved that he was not a Skrull by answering questions about his past, including his small quirks, the name of his first pet, and details about his military career; memories that a Skrull couldn't fabricate.

Fury arrives at the P.E.G.A.S.U.S. Facility
To confirm her suspicions, with the intent to corner her into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, Fury drove her to the Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility. En route, Vers explained to Fury the history of the ongoing Kree-Skrull War, and the Skrulls' interest in Wendy Lawson's Light-Speed Engine. Upon arrival at the base, Fury explained to Vers when she learned of his full name that he is only referred to by his surname.

Fury covertly alerts 'Keller' of Vers' location
Arriving inside the facility, Fury and Vers  were told to wait in a locked room. While they waited for security to give them clearance inside, however, an impatient Fury used a piece of tape and placed it on his badge to take the fingerprint of an official with security clearance who had touched his badge, to give them access to the building. As Vers headed to the file room, Fury secretly contacted S.H.I.E.L.D. and alerted 'Keller' of Vers' location inside the facility through his pager, dismissing the contact as him simply trying to contact his mother.

Fury discovers Wendy Lawson's file
As they were leaving, Fury encountered Goose, and began petting her, before Vers told Fury to keep moving. While inside the facility's archives, Fury and Vers discovered information about Lawson and found a notebook of Kree glyphs inside her files. When Vers realized her life on Earth as Carol Danvers, Fury explained that both Lawson and Danvers were supposedly killed in a faulty test flight of an Asis Aircraft.

Ambush at Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility
Fury realizes that Keller is a Skrull impostor
While Vers continued reading the file, Fury went to the entrance of the facility to meet the several incoming S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, including 'Keller'. When Fury and 'Keller' boarded an elevator down to the archives to capture Vers, 'Keller' called Fury by his first name, Nicholas. This caused Fury to become suspicious, since most people who know Fury, including the real Keller, never call him by his first name. 

Fury is held at gunpoint by Talos
This caused Fury to assume that Keller was replaced by a Skrull. Fury then described a plan of action and tested Talos by asking if he remembers a strategy during a fictitious mission that he supposedly did with the real Keller, but Talos didn’t notice and agreed with him, making Fury confident that he was a Skrull. Seeing that S.H.I.E.L.D. was being infiltrated by the Skrulls, Fury deceived Talos and decided to go rogue with Vers. 

Fury engages in a fight with Talos
When Fury left, however, Talos realized that Fury was already suspicious, and sent several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, including Phil Coulson and Whitcher, to capture Fury dead or alive. Talos manages to find Fury and hold him at gunpoint, but Fury disarmed him, leading to a fight. Despite putting up a good fight, Fury was eventually overpowered and knocked down by Talos's might. 

Fury is defeated by Talos
As Talos was standing over him, he was stunned by Vers' photon blast, who had decided to come back and rescue Fury. When more agents arrived, Vers blasted a hole through the ceiling to the next floor so that she and Fury could get through it and escape.  As the two were making their escape, Fury was scolded by Vers for betraying her for calling in S.H.I.E.L.D., to which Fury then apologized for. 

Fury and Vers are halted by Phil Coulson
When they made their way to the stairwell, they were halted by Coulson, who held them at gunpoint. Coulson decided to help them by misdirecting the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Once they were temporarily safe, Fury handed over his Transmitter Pager to Vers so that he wouldn’t use it again. The two then made their way to the facility's hangar, where they found a Quadjet. 

Fury and Vers escape on a Quadjet
When they sat in the cockpit, Fury asked Vers if she knew how to fly the aircraft, which she was fairly certain of. Vers then proceeded to fly the aircraft out of the facility. Shortly after escaping, the two realized that Goose had stowed away in the Quadjet as well. Once they were in the clear zone, Fury was shown a photo of Vers that she had found. They then deduced that she was the pilot that went down with "Lawson" and somehow arrived on Hala.

Fury bonds with Vers
Fury was then informed by Vers that they needed to find her old friend, Maria Rambeau, so Fury instructed her on how to get to Louisiana. When Vers asked him why Coulson didn’t hand them over to the Skrulls, Fury informed her that it was him going by his instinct to let them go. The two then bonded with each other as they flew, laughing over their experiences with each other.

Alliance with the Skrulls
Fury, Vers and Goose then made their way to Rambeau Residence in Louisiana. After they arrived, Vers was greeted by Monica Rambeau, who called her Auntie Carol and her mother Maria Rambeau, who was apparently a long-time friend, while Fury watched as all this unfolded. They all then went inside where Vers filmed them in on the last six years of her life. Fury then went to go collect some of Vers' items with Monica, while Vers talked with Maria. Fury also witnessed Monica show Vers some photos of her old life.

Fury threatening to shoot Talos
Fury joined Vers and Maria after Talos showed up at the house and wanted to make a deal with Vers in order to help him find the Light-Speed Engine's core. After listening to a black box recording of Vers and Mar-Vell, Vers remembered who she was, and both she and Fury agreed to help find the core at Mar-Vell's Laboratory to help Talos end the Kree-Skrull War. From there, Fury, Vers, Talos, Maria, and Goose boarded the Quadjet, upgraded by Norex, and headed off to find the core.

Fury being held captive
Once in space, they found Mar-Vell's cloaked laboratory and proceeded to board, where they eventually found the core, which Mar-Vell referred to in her notes as the Tesseract. As it turned out, Mar-Vell's lab was doubling as a refuge for the Skrulls. They only revealed themselves after Talos called for them. Talos did not come for the Tesseract, but rather his wife and daughter, who were on board. Suddenly, they found themselves surrounded and outnumbered by the  Starforce and Kree soldiers, led by Yon-Rogg. The Kree successfully retrieved the Tesseract and took Fury, Danvers, Rambeau, and Goose hostage.

Helping Skrull Refugees
Fury commanding Goose to attack
After overhearing Minn-Erva command that the Skrulls be ejected into space, Fury and Maria Rambeau were freed from captivity by Carol Danvers, who tasked them with getting the Skrulls and the Tesseract on the Quadjet and to safety. They found the Skrulls, though Talos had shape-shifted into a Kree soldier and used this disguise as a ruse to get Fury, Rambeau, and the rest of the Skrull refugees off the ship. 

Fury watches Maria Rambeau pilot the Quadjet
After taking out three soldiers, Fury, Rambeau, Talos, and the Skrull refugees boarded the Quadjet to escape. However, they were tailed by Minn-Erva, and while Rambeau managed to blow her out the sky, Yon-Rogg began shooting at them soon thereafter. However, Danvers arrived just in time and knocked Yon-Rogg out of the sky.

Aftermath
Fury moments before his left eye is blinded
Upon their victory, Fury was playing with Goose to celebrate but she scratched Fury's left eye, leaving a nasty scar which eventually blinded him. That night, Fury, Carol Danvers, Talos, Soren, Maria Rambeau, and the Skrulls returned to the Rambeau Residence, where Fury offered Rambeau a job as a pilot for S.H.I.E.L.D. Afterward, he and Danvers discussed the Tesseract being hidden on Earth. She then returned Fury's pager to him, which she upgraded with a range of at least a couple galaxies.

Fury says goodbye to Carol Danvers
Despite what happened, Fury agreed to take care of Goose while Danvers was away with the Skrulls. Returning to his office, he was approached by Phil Coulson, who brought him a box of prosthetic eyeballs. Coulson then asked Fury if the rumors that the Kree had blinded him as punishment for not giving them the Tesseract were true, to which Fury refused to confirm nor deny the claim.

Avengers Initiative
Fury creates the Avengers Initiative document
Fury's experience with Carol Danvers made him realize that the world's arsenal, let alone S.H.I.E.L.D.'s can't protect the world, especially from intergalactic threats. This led him to form the Protectors Initiative but later renamed it into the Avengers Initiative, naming after Danvers' call-sign of "Avenger". According to the Initiative, S.H.I.E.L.D. would seek out individuals with unique abilities and powers and record them in the Index to form a response team should any threat beyond the warfighting capacity of conventional military forces appear.

Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Mission in Bogotá and Promotion
Fury is promoted by Alexander Pierce
Eventually, Fury became Deputy Chief of a S.H.I.E.L.D. station in Bogotá, working under Alexander Pierce's command. When the National Liberation Army took several political officers hostage, including Pierce's daughter, Fury proposed a plan to get the hostages out, but Pierce insisted on negotiating with the rebels. However, Fury disobeyed his orders and got the hostages out. For his actions, Fury was promoted to the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. when Pierce gave up his position to become a member of the World Security Council. As Director, Fury was interested in searching for mysterious and dangerous artifacts, such as the Darkhold, which he was unable to find.

Avengers Recruitment
As a part of the Avengers Initiative, Fury attempted to locate Captain America, whose body was lost following the end of World War II, although the WSC were highly critical of his attempts. The Council instead wanted Fury to focus his efforts on the Tesseract and harnessing all its power for S.H.I.E.L.D.'s benefit. However, Fury continued the search despite their demands.

Fury recruited Clint Barton as one of his most trusted agents while agreeing to keep his family off-records for protection. Fury sent Barton on a mission to eliminate the assassin, codenamed Black Widow. Barton found her, but instead of killing her, he recruited her into S.H.I.E.L.D.

When Fury learned of General Thaddeus Ross hunting down Bruce Banner, he personally approached Banner in a bar and tried to talk to him peacefully. When this failed, Fury cued Agents Johnson and Peterson to provoke Banner into displaying his powers, causing him to then turn into Hulk. Although alarmed at his transformation, Fury successfully stopped Hulk’s rampage by appealing to Banner’s desire to not hurt the innocent people in the bar, causing Hulk to leave. Afterwards at S.H.I.E.L.D, he officially declared Hulk to be Ross's problem for the time being.

Birth of Iron Man
Fury goes to personally meet with Tony Stark
In 2009, Fury learned that Tony Stark had been kidnapped by the Ten Rings, so he sent Phil Coulson and Jasper Sitwell to deal with the situation. However, Stark eventually escaped and not long after, Iron Man had also appeared and begun destroying Ten Rings units, as Fury suspected Stark may have been brainwashed. Fury kept his close watch on the situation and soon learned that Stark was Iron Man, and Obadiah Stane had ordered his kidnapping.

Fury first introduces himself to Tony Stark
Fury went into Stark's Mansion to talk with Stark about the Avengers Initiative, as Stark announced his identity as Iron Man. However, Stark made it clear he did not want to be involved with the Avengers. In order to closely monitor Stark, Fury personally ordered Black Widow to infiltrate Stark Industries as Natalie Rushman.

Fury was ordered to recruiting Emil Blonsky into the Avengers and he dispatched Coulson and Sitwell to find their solution, as they decided to recruit Stark to annoy Thaddeus Ross until he had refused to allow him to join the team. Fearing the death of an Avenger, Fury had tasked Coulson to be the head of Project T.A.H.I.T.I., a project with the goal of reviving subjects from the dead. With GH.325 made from a deceased Kree who they still had in storage, they cured a group of terminally ill people, with the initial tests were successful as fatal illnesses were cured, however, later everything went wrong, causing the T.A.H.I.T.I. test subjects to mentally deteriorate.

Coulson recommended the project be shut down; however, Fury had secretly decided to continue with the project. Fury later learned that Stark's drunken behavior resulted in James Rhodes making the decision that in his current state, Stark should simply not use his own technology, as he proceeded to take possession of the Mark II Armor and hand it over the United States Air Force. At the same time, Fury was also informed by Coulson about the Wormhole that had appearing on the planet along with a hammer that was coded as an 0-8-4. Fury sent Coulson into New Mexico to meet Erik Selvig as well as Jane Foster who were also investigating the situation.

Helping Tony Stark
Director Fury locates the hungover Tony Stark
Shortly afterwards, Fury had learned that Iron Man was suffering from Palladium poisoning due to the Arc Reactor in his chest which kept shrapnel away from his heart, and had just been involved in a very public fight with James Rhodes at his mansion, during which much of the residence had been destroyed and Rhodes had stolen one of the suits to be handed over to the United States Air Force for their own study and use. Fury then personally confronted the hungover and still suited Tony Stark at Randy's Donuts for becoming a problem that he had to solve. 

Fury having a conversation with Tony Stark
As they sat inside the shop, Stark continued to insist that he was not interested in joining the Avengers, to which Fury noted how Stark still wanted to do everything himself before sarcastically asking how that was working out for him so far. While Stark questioned whether or not to look into Fury's eye or his eye patch and if he was even real, Fury turned his attention onto the palladium poisoning on Stark's neck. They were then joined by Agent Natasha Romanoff, with Fury revealing he had placed Black Widow undercover within Stark Industries to keep an eye on Stark's behavior, prompting Stark to try firing her.

Fury and Black Widow confronting Iron Man
Fury began listing off everything that Stark had recently done which alarmed them, including making Pepper Potts the CEO of his company, selling his possessions and allowing Rhodes to fly off in one of his Iron Man Armors, although Stark claimed that Rhodes had stolen it, which Fury simply mocked him for. Stark then questioned what Fury wanted, which annoyed Fury even more as he told Stark that he had bigger issues to deal with around the world.

Fury commenting on Tony Stark's recovery
Following Fury's orders, Romanoff then provided Stark with a shot of Lithium Dioxide, which eased back his infection, although it did not fully cure it. When Stark insisted that there was no cure and that he had looked for every single known element to replace his Palladium Arc Reactor and found nothing, Fury informed Stark there was indeed a way to cure his infection and he just had not found it yet. Fury promised S.H.I.E.L.D. would help Stark find what he needed.

Discussing Howard Stark
Fury and Tony Stark discuss the Arc Reactor
Fury and Tony Stark returned to Stark's home, where they discussed the history of the Arc Reactor, as Fury then claimed it was based on unfinished technology while Stark argued that it was finished but only really worked when he and Ho Yinsen had miniaturized it and put it in his chest. Fury, however, explained that Howard Stark believed the Arc Reactor was merely a stepping stone to something greater, as it would begin an incredible energy race across the world.

Fury tells Stark about all of his father's work
Fury then began providing information on the background of Anton Vanko, the father of Ivan Vanko, who had recently attempted to kill Stark, before he revealed that Howard Stark was, in fact, one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D., which greatly surprised Stark. Fury and Natasha Romanoff provided Stark with information and materials from his father, which proved instrumental in finding a replacement power source for his personal Arc Reactor.

Fury leaves Tony Stark to continue his work
Fury left Phil Coulson at Stark's mansion with orders not to allow him to leave until he had found a cure for his infection. Fury told Stark that he would be keeping his eye on him before leaving. As things in New Mexico became more complicated with the discovery of the mysterious Mjølnir, Fury sent Clint Barton to join Coulson at the site. He also assigned Romanoff to keep track of the fugitive Bruce Banner, who was at Culver University.

Recruiting a Consultant
Fury brings Tony Stark for a meeting
Fury met with Tony Stark once again after Stark had successfully managed to fix his Arc Reactor and had gone on to defeat Whiplash during the attack on the Stark Expo. Once Fury arrived, he had found Stark looking over a brief for the Avengers Initiative which he then claimed he did not want Stark to read, instead of handing him Natasha Romanoff's assessment of Stark himself during her undercover mission with Stark.

Fury and Tony Stark discuss his review
Reading the assessment in which Romanoff claimed he contained compulsive behavior and self-destructive tendencies, with textbook narcissism. However, while Iron Man had been approved by Romanoff to join the Avengers, since Stark had proven himself unsuitable for the Avengers due to all of his recent actions, he was rejected, with Fury instead considering recruiting James Rhodes to the position, as Fury instead offered to recruit Stark's services only as a consultant.

Fury's offer being turned down by Tony Stark
Standing up and shaking his hand, Stark told Fury that he could not afford his services before going to walk out. However, before he left, Stark then agreed to be the consultant as long as Fury helped him convince Senator Stern to present him and Rhodes with the medals for all their bravery in defeating Whiplash, which Fury agreed to. Romanoff then gave Fury report on Bruce Banner's transformation into Hulk and his successful fight against Emil Blonsky.

Fury agreeing to Tony Stark's one request
As his long week continued, Phil Coulson informed Fury about the Destroyer's attack on Puente Antiguo, while Fury had learned how General Thaddeus Ross hacked S.H.I.E.L.D.'s computers, having been given permission by the World Security Council. Fury ordered Romanoff to meet Samuel Sterns to take any papers on Banner, as Romanoff took Sterns into custody, having shot him through the leg having also witnessed Sterns' incomplete transformation.

End of the Week
Fury first introduces himself to Erik Selvig
Fury's recruitment drive turned to people who had been involved in a destructive incident in Puente Antiguo, New Mexico. Impressed by the work he had seen and the discoveries that had been made, Fury had summoned Culver University astrophysics professor Erik Selvig, who had been associated with all the recent incidents, to the Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility, greeting him in a hallway.

Fury discusses Selvig and Jane Foster's work
While Selvig joked that the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents had taken him there to kill him, Fury commented on how impressed he had been, although Selvig had still mainly credited Jane Foster for all of her most recent discoveries about the Bifrost Bridge and the Nine Realms, which he called unprecedented, although Fury then made it clear that this had already been predicted. Fury then drew the scientist's attention to a secure, portable storage case he had kept within the facility.

Fury decides to show Erik Selvig the Tesseract
Fury revealed a glowing cube within the case and suggested that it was a source of immense power, although nobody had been able to determine how to tap all the power. Selvig accepted the challenge to investigate the object further. Fury gave his report to the World Security Council. Finally satisfied with his work, the Council decided to increase the funding for the agency while expanding jurisdictions for S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, and augment Fury's strategic authority.

Awakening of Steve Rogers
Fury introduces himself to Steve Rogers
A year following the big week, Fury's Avengers Initiative was slowly losing traction by the time another potential recruit was found. Steve Rogers, the world's first supersoldier, who had been frozen in the Arctic ever since his battle against the Red Skull all the way back during World War II, and he had someone managed to miraculously survive his frozen entombment for almost seventy years.

Fury explains the situation to Steve Rogers
Fury oversaw Rogers's recovery and rehabilitation as he was placed in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Headquarters within Times Square until he awoke. Fury then personally intercepted Rogers when the man awoke and escaped into the heart of New York City since he had become utterly confused about his surroundings as he had no knowledge of what had transpired in the world since the 1940s and was shocked to see the world around him and the advancements in technology.

Fury asks whether Steve Rogers will be alright
Once Fury had explained the situation, he then saw that Rogers was having a hard to taking in the new information, as he looked around at the new world while Fury's S.H.I.E.L.D. agents surrounded him. Seeing how distressed he was, Fury questioned if Rogers would be alright, as Rogers noted he had a date with Peggy Carter which he had subsequently missed due to being trapped in the ice for so many decades, unsure if Carter was actually still alive or not.

Chitauri Invasion
Loki's Invasion of Earth
Fury standing with Phil Coulson and Maria Hill
With little to show for his efforts with bringing the Avengers together, Fury shelved his plan and had begun focusing on weaponry instead. Fury's Phase 2, as the offshoot idea came to be called, involved re-engineering weapons technology that had emerged in the hands of HYDRA years earlier during World War II, as well as another cutting edge, or alien technology. The Tesseract, which he had assigned Erik Selvig to investigate, formed a significant part of this puzzle which Fury kept a close eye on throughout Selvig's experiments.

Fury giving Maria Hill her evacuation orders
When the Tesseract had begun suddenly emitting unexpectedly high levels of Gamma Radiation, Fury was quick to personally take charge of the operation. He arrived at the Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility base with Maria Hill; there they met Phil Coulson. Fury ordered the evacuation of the base and Phase 2 prototypes to be moved to a safe distance while questioning how bad the situation was, to which Coulson then explained he did not know. Fury also found Hill questioning his plan for evacuation and his current priorities, believing that they should be focused on trying to control the Tesseract however they could.

Fury studies the Tesseract's unusual activity
Fury then ordered his updates from Selvig and was informed that the Tesseract's activities were unexplainable at this point, as Selvig had explained that due to the Tesseract being its own energy source they could not shut down the power. Fury listened while Selvig explained that despite them preparing for the situation as best they could, this was difficult to control, noting that it was emitting some low levels of Gamma Radiation, which Fury recalled had turned Bruce Banner into Hulk, as he noted that Gamma could be harmful. Fury requested to speak to Clint Barton, as Selvig noted that he was watching them.

Fury and Hawkeye witnessing Loki's arrival
Barton then joined Fury to give him his report on the situation as it continued unfolding, Barton was convinced that Selvig was not to blame and instead explained his theory that the Tesseract was a door to the other end of space, noting that it was possible that this door was being opened from the other side. Barton's theory was soon proved correct as the Tesseract opened a portal that allowed Loki to arrival to Earth. Seeing Loki was armed with his Scepter, Fury initially tried to reason with him, but Loki responded by killing much staff in the laboratory, before using the Mind Stone inside the Scepter to turn Selvig, Barton and other agents into his own personal slaves.

Fury desperately attempts to reason with Loki
Defenseless against Loki's power, Fury made a desperate attempt to escape with the Tesseract, pulling it out of its container and trying to leave without being seen. However, Loki ordered him to stop before introducing himself as Loki of Asgard, while Selvig then realized that Loki was the brother of Thor. Knowing that the energy levels above them were causing serious damage to the facility, Fury stalled Loki by questioning Loki on his true scheme for the Earth, however, when they discovered that Fury was stalling while he waited for the building to implode, Loki ordered Barton to shoot Fury in the chest and take the Tesseract.

Fury escaping from the exploding facility
Fury survived being shot due to wearing a Bulletproof Vest and had managed to get back onto his feet, before getting onto the radio to inform Maria Hill of Barton's betrayal and ordering her to do what she could to attempt to stop Barton from escaping with Loki and the Tesseract. With the energy from the Tesseract going critical over his head, Fury ran through the facility to get back upstairs and make his escape, avoiding pieces of debris as the facility fell apart around him until Fury made it to a helicopter. Once in the air, Fury witnessed the entire facility implode, killing everybody who was still inside.

Fury attempting to stop Loki from escaping
Determined not to lose sight of the Tesseract due to the fear that it's incredible power in Loki's hands could cause mass destruction, Fury had managed to get ahead of Barton's Jeep just as it came out of a secret entrance to the now destroyed facility, as they had left behind Hill whose own jeep had become trapped underneath much of the collapsed rubble but survived. Although Hawkeye attempted to drive out of sight of the helicopter, Fury had then opened up his door and began shooting down at them, willing to kill Hawkeye if it meant they could stop Loki from making his escape with the Tesseract.

Fury furiously shooting at the escaping Loki
However, before Fury could land a successful gunshot and stop the jeep's escape in time, he was then quickly shot down with a single powerful blast fired from Loki's Scepter which had destroyed the tail rotor, as the Helicopter began violently spinning out of control and finally crash-landed onto the ground, with Fury managing to leap to safety moments before the impact. Fury had survived the crash and continued to shoot at Loki until he ran out of bullets and watched in dismay while Hawkeye drove Loki into the distance along with Selvig and the Tesseract, with Fury unable to do anything to stop them, with Fury now standing alone in the ruins of the destroyed facility.

Fury informs Hill and Coulson they are at war
With Loki now out of sight, Fury got on his radio and confirmed that both Coulson and Hill were still alive following the facility implosion, ordering them to get every S.H.I.E.L.D. agent they had who was not focused on rescuing possible survivors underneath all the rubble to be searching for Loki. Fury then ordered Coulson to get back to base as their mission was the level seven and they were now at war. With that, Fury reactivated the Avengers Initiative, sending out his team to recruit Iron Man and Hulk with the intention of fighting the forces Loki would send against them with the Tesseract's power.

Recruiting Captain America
Fury argues with Gideon Malick about his plan
Desperate for a solution to the problem of Loki's possession of the Tesseract, Fury informed the World Security Council that he was activating the Avengers Initiative. While they discussed what happened, Hawley had suggested called Thor but Fury made it clear that was unlikely as Gideon Malick argued that the Avengers were too unstable to make a team to be relied on, but Fury insisted that this war would be won with his soldiers.

Fury finds Steve Rogers training in the gym
Ignoring Malick's concerns, Fury met with Steve Rogers in his gym, where he was still trying to cope with having been asleep for nearly seventy years, with Fury suggesting that he should be out celebrating his survival and enjoying the new world he was in. Rogers, however, noted that when he disappeared, World War II was still being fought and he had only recently learned that it was won soon afterwards, although Rogers was still unsure of what America had lost. Fury then noted that they made some mistakes along the way, and confessed that some of these mistakes had been made very recently.

Fury recruits Steve Rogers into the Avengers
Fury then informed Rogers that he had come there with a mission for him, noting that he was trying to save the entire world before handing Rogers the file about the Tesseract, which he noted had been found in the ocean by Howard Stark while he had still been searching for Rogers in the 1940s. Fury then explained what S.H.I.E.L.D. had been doing with the Tesseract and went on to explain the current situation to Rogers, hoping that he would be able to provide them with some insight into the Tesseract after seeing Red Skull using it for HYDRA's ultimate goals of world domination, although Rogers was mortified that the Tesseract had fallen into the wrong hands once again.

Fury convinces Steve Rogers to join the fight
As Rogers then questioned who took the Tesseract from them, Fury explained how Loki had taken it and was from another world, as they made a bet over whether or not anything could still surprise Rogers now he was in this new world. As Rogers left, Fury had asked for any more information, with Rogers telling him the best thing that could be done with it would be losing it in the ocean. Although Rogers was unhappy when he learned that S.H.I.E.L.D. had been in possession of the Tesseract, Fury was able to recruit him, and dispatched agents to call in the help of both Tony Stark and Bruce Banner.

Activating the Avengers
Fury takes over command of the Helicarrier
With time running out to stop Loki from completing his goals of world domination, Fury had all their key candidates for the Avengers found and brought onto the Helicarrier, with the assistance of both Natasha Romanoff and Phil Coulson, who gave each of them all a full briefing about Loki and the plan to find and stop him before it was too late. Fury had the Helicarrier flown into the air and put on clocking so that their mission could continue without being interrupted as Maria Hill relayed his orders.

Fury is given ten dollars from Steve Rogers
With the Helicarrier now in the air and almost completely invisible to the human eye, Fury had then turned his attention oval to their now assembled Avengers Initiative. Having seen the incredible sight of the advanced technology that the Helicarrier was now displaying and the scale of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s influence over the world, allowed Rogers to go quietly hand Fury ten dollars to complete a bet they had made about whether or not Rogers could be surprised by any new things since fighting HYDRA and waking up in the modern era, as Fury smiled to himself and then went over to greet all of the other Avengers.

Fury personally greets Doctor Bruce Banner
Fury welcomed them all onto the ship, shaking Bruce Banner's hand and personally thanking him for agreeing to help them. Banner asked Fury how long he would be required to stay with S.H.I.E.L.D. but Fury assured him that it would only be until they found the Tesseract. Now feeling more confident, Banner suggested that they begin scanning for Gamma Radiation to locate the Tesseract while Fury had ordered Romanoff show him to his laboratory where he began focusing all his efforts on searching the Earth, getting help from laboratories around the world to find Loki and Erik Selvig as quickly as possible.

Fury sends Captain America to capture Loki
Not long after the team came together, Loki had made his first public appearance in Germany which had been seen by Jasper Sitwell, so Fury had then sent Rogers to capture him with the Quinjet and bring him back to the Helicarrier. Loki was apprehended by the combined strength of Captain America and Iron Man, heralding an unexpected further addition to the collection of extraordinary people when Loki's adopted brother Thor arrived, making demands of his own for Loki's extradition. Although the clash between Thor and Iron Man occurred, Captain America was able to end that and they recruited Thor.

Dealing with Asgardians
Fury interrogating the captured Loki in his cell
With Loki having been successfully captured within Germany, he was brought onboard the Helicarrier under armed guard and locked up inside the cage designed to keep Hulk. Fury then spoke to Loki personally, threatening that if he made any attempt to escape than his cell would be dropped off the ship and fall thirty thousand feet to the ground, as Loki noted how the cell had not been designed for him, to which Fury then confirmed that it had in fact originally been designed for someone who was considerably stronger than Loki.
