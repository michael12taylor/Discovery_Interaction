<html><p>During his time in Sakaar, Hulk's control over Banner's body increased significantly, to the point that he was able to stay as Hulk for two whole years and prevent himself from reverting back to Banner. His increased self-awareness gave him increasingly visible layers of personality, similar to a five-year-old's , instead of just being a very destructive rage monster. By the time Thor found Hulk while himself trapped in Sakaar, Hulk became intelligent enough to actively converse with others, albeit still with an immature speech pattern. Thusly, he was able to verbally acknowledge his human half but repeatedly refuted Banner's existence, claiming "No Banner, only Hulk!" to resentment and bitterness for Banner. He would later call Thor “Banner’s friend”, demonstrating a reluctance to trust or help him as a result. While he gained more self-awareness and personality, Hulk was still susceptible to emotion and could easily become more feral due to stress and frustration, such as when he fought Thor in the Contest of Champions. Despite this, he could still demonstrate a calm and stable demeanor, which allows him to not solely act aggressive and hostile, such as when he talks calmly with Thor after the two of them argue and befriend Valkyrie during his stay on the planet. However, Hulk was also wary of others, due to his history of violence on Earth, which caused him to believe that humanity hated him and made him refuse to return. As Bruce’s personality resurfaced do to Hulk’s positive encounters with Thor and seeing Natasha’s last message to him after their battle with Ultron, Hulk became frantic and desperately tried to not lose control to him, resorting to almost pleading to Banner to stop. Upon regaining control, Banner became afraid of Hulk once more, baffled at the fact that Hulk existed for more than two years, inferring that transforming again would likely result in Hulk gaining full control and the ability to indefinitely suppress Banner.

Hulk's time on Sakaar allowed him to form his own identity. Having risen to the top of the ranks and becoming the Grandmaster's Champion, Hulk enjoyed a celebrity lifestyle. This was as close to a "normal life" that he was able to enjoy. During such time, he was able to develop his emotions beyond just anger. His interactions with Valkyrie and Thor demonstrated his playful nature. In addition, upon hearing Thor’s spiteful claim that Earth indeed hated him, Hulk appeared genuinely upset. This fortifies the notion that Hulk doesn't want to be alone as he claims. This was highlighted when he begged Thor to stay on Sakaar as his friend. Unfortunately, Hulk's low emotional intelligence and raw strength provide a combination that creates a being who cannot easily co-exist with others. Tragically, Hulk may be the loneliest Avenger yet the one who needs friends the most.

Because Hulk has never lost a fight before; his experience and growing intelligence in Sakaar reinforced the idea and image so much that he believed himself to be invincible, no longer a primitive rage monster like when he first came into existence, and now capable of grasping a wide spectrum of emotions, the defeat at Thanos' hands traumatized Hulk tremendously; he has since grown fed up of being used as a weapon by Banner and the Avengers that he outright leaves Banner alone to fend for himself for the first time since his creation, to the extent of staunchly refusing to transform and come out to fight even when told to.

Banner ironically realizes that despite getting his wish of being cured of Hulk, this has left him vulnerable and unable to help his teammates directly as he has lost the strength gained from being Hulk. However, despite this, Banner displays great courage by fighting in the Battle of Wakanda wearing the Hulkbuster Armor, even facing Thanos again without fear.

In the years that followed the Snap, Banner started to see Hulk as a cure to his woes instead of a disease in need of curing. His 18-month-long transformation into his current form, which combined his intelligence with Hulk's strength, helped him feel peace and acceptance in his life, a balance that the separation of Hulk and Banner would never have allowed as long as it remained.

Ironically, Banner was one of the few individuals who improved themselves in the post-Snap world. In contrast to figures such as Tony Stark or Thor, who had quit heroism, Banner was active within the community. Consequently, he became a celebrity and a figure of safety and stability in the fragile world. Attitudes about Hulk sharply contrasted to those a decade ago. A once feared figure was now a beloved hero.

In his new form, Banner kept his pacifist ways, having expressed disgust at War Machine's suggestion that the Avengers strangle an infant Thanos and written off his past penchant for property damage as "gratuitous" before halfheartedly smashing up a New York taxi, later he obtained the Time Stone by calmly negotiating with the Ancient One instead of attacking her. Despite his guilt for losing to Thanos twice, he felt no need to seek vengeance when Thanos attacked the Avengers Facility. This, combined with his embarrassment of his past Hulk-self, illustrates how he had moved beyond feeling a need to 'smash' things and prove his strength.

Banner became significantly more casual and confident in public areas after Hulk became a celebrity, openly giving autographs to his fans and joking about "Hulking out" while doing so. Despite this, Banner can still take a more aggressive form when the situation calls for it and behave more like his former Hulk self, as seen during the Battle of Earth. Additionally, during times of conflict, Banner had developed a polite sternness and authority. This was seen during his encounter with Thor on New Asgard, in which he politely asked Thor to stop holding him before forcing him to let go. Furthermore, during his encounter with the Ancient One, Banner asked for the Time Stone before calmly attempting to take it from her.

The Nano Gauntlet and the Blip represented a chance for Banner's life to have a meaningful resolution. Previously, Banner would not have been strong enough to solely wield the gauntlet. Conversely, Hulk would not have had the mental capability to resurrect half of all life. Banner noted the irony of Stones emitting gamma radiation; as it was his expertise and the source of Hulk's power.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Bruce Banner and Hulk are one
Artificially Enhanced Physiology: Bruce Banner subjected himself to a recreated version of the Super Soldier Serum in an attempt to develop a result similar to the original Project Rebirth from World War II, albeit substituting vita radiation with gamma radiation. As a result, Banner is able to transform into Hulk when his heart rate increases to high levels or when he loses control of his emotions. As Hulk, Banner is a giant green-skinned humanoid with immense strength fueled by his rage, meaning the angrier he gets the stronger he becomes, and is one of the most powerful beings on Earth. Former director S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick Fury classified the Hulk as THREAT LEVEL RED, only to be dealt with using surveillance in the future. According to Samuel Sterns, the transformation is triggered when an electric pulse generated on the amygdala increases the gamma radiation of Bruce's cells. Betty Ross' reagent allows the cells to absorb the energy temporarily, which then abates, resulting in a chemical reaction that produces a myostatin primer. When Hulk transforms back into Banner, the excess muscle mass and energy is dissipated and he is tricken with exhaustion, with the metabolic shift in his system requiring him to refuel. The total time of transformation falls anywhere between seconds to several minutes, depending on the initial adrenaline surge, which will be determined by the original stimulus.  Despite Banner's initial inability to control the transformations, he managed to attain some level of control through training and practice, and Banner's consciousness is buried within Hulk, influencing his behavior to a very limited extent. Shortly before being part of the Avengers, Banner became able to trigger his transformations at will, remaining angry in a controlled state, which allowed Hulk to be much smarter and self-controlled in battle. However, the more stressful or provoking his surroundings, the more difficult it is for Hulk to become calm enough to transform back into Banner, which leads to Natasha Romanoff using her "lullaby" technique to calm Hulk at the end of each battle. Despite Banner previously being able to control Hulk, his alter-ego was slowly becoming more self-aware and developing a mind of his own. After the events of Sokovia, Hulk left Earth and became a gladiator on Sakaar, keeping Banner suppressed for two years. After meeting Thor, Banner re-emerged and, despite realizing that transforming again would mean that he might not change back, willingly unleashed Hulk to aid Thor and the Asgardians. Following this battle, Hulk fought Thanos one-on-one and was effortlessly defeated. Hulk has since refused to come back, as he has grown fearful of the Titan and his forces, leaving Banner to fend for himself. After the events of the Snap and Thor executing Thanos, Bruce spent 18 months in a gamma lab to fuse his genius-level intellect and knowledge with Hulk's extraordinary superhuman abilities together to become an amalgamation of both Hulk and himself.
Hulk punching a Leviathan
Superhuman Strength: Hulk's primary power is his immense superhuman strength. His incredible high-level of superhuman strength allows him to rip steel apart as if it were made of paper, to break vehicles with a single punch, stop a speeding Humvee in its tracks by stomping it into the ground, injure and halt a massive Leviathan with a single punch, do a powerful thunderclap to stop a military helicopter from blowing up, or catch a HYDRA tank struck by Thor during the Avengers assault on the HYDRA Research base in Sokovia and proceeded to throw it at a considerable distance as well. In combat, Hulk often uses his strength to throw heavy objects (like cars, forklift trucks, HYDRA tanks for example) or his smaller opponents in order to defeat his enemies, such as when Hulk threw a human-sized Emil Blonsky more than 40 feet away with a single kick or when he hurled Loki around repeatedly while holding him by the leg. Overall, few individuals have been able to match or surpass Hulk's strength, such as the Abomination, who despite his greater base level of strength ultimately succumbed to Hulk's when he endangered the life of Betty Ross, angering him enough to overpower the gamma monster. Thor, who Hulk was able to hit hard enough to cause his nose to bleed, send flying with a punch, and upon growing angry, managed to almost overpower him in the Contest of Champions, although he was himself almost overpowered after Thor gained his full powers, Iron Man, who had to develop a special Hulkbuster armor to battle him in case of need and still needing Hulk to calm down to overpower him, Fenris, who had managed to contend with Hulk in their battle, but was ultimately hurled into outer space by Hulk, fully empowered Surtur, whom Hulk was able to impressively stagger with a leaping blow, before Surtur effortlessly swatted Hulk away, and Thanos, who Hulk managed to surprise and stagger with his blows; however, Thanos effortlessly struck him with various blows and knocked him out, leaving him unconscious for a short amount of time. Hulk was also able to lift and throw a Chitauri a great distance. Hulk's immense strength allowed him to hold the debris from the base of the New Avengers Facility, even after one arm was badly damaged from using the Nano Gauntlet, so that neither Rocket, Rhodey and himself were crushed. He managed to do this long enough for Ant-Man to arrive and rescue them by becoming Giant-Man. Hulk's seemingly most impressive strength feat is leaving a fist dent on a wall made of an extremely durable silicon-carbide vibranium alloy. Hulk's strength also extends to his legs, allowing him to leap great distances or great heights with precision, such as when reached the top of Stark Tower from ground level in a single leap. After the Ambush in Rio de Janeiro, Hulk traveled more than 4100 miles (6600 km) on foot from southeastern Brazil to the forests of Guatemala in just one day, implying his superhuman displays of leaping power, speed and stamina. Carrying Black Widow on his back, Hulk was able to make enormous jumps through the air, reaching the flying city of Novi Grad. During the Destruction of Asgard, Hulk was also able to leap several hundred meters from the Rainbow Bridge towards Surtur and launch himself onto the Statesman while grabbing Thor and Valkyrie. During the Theft of the Time Stone, Hulk was able to mimic his 2012 self by jumping from building to building trying to reach the Ancient One.
Hulk withstanding multiple bullets
Superhuman Durability: Hulk is able to withstand blows and attacks of considerable force; even high caliber bullets bounce off him and flames cause him no damage whatsoever. His bone, skin, and muscles have an extreme density and he possesses a high degree of resistance to injury, pain, and disease. Hulk also withstood multiple energy blasts from Chitauri weaponry, extreme cold in the Arctic, great impacts from heights of several miles (though the impact knocked him unconscious, forcing him to revert back into Banner). In addition, Iron Man noted the amount of gamma radiation Banner was exposed to would have killed him if it had not given him the ability to transform into Hulk. Only beings with incredible force or extremely powerful weapons can harm him, such as when Hulk was painfully pierced by Abomination's skeletal spikes, was later painfully pierced by Fenris' teeth, when a blow from Thor wielding Mjølnir knocked him out for a moment and when Thanos badly beat him. While Hulk did survive quite a few blows from the Hulkbuster with little discomfort, he got a tooth knocked out in the confrontation. In addition, Hulk's durability is also tied to his anger level - during the fight against the Hulkbuster, he slightly calmed down, which slightly reduced his durability after witnessing the destruction that he caused in South Africa, allowing Iron Man to use the advantage, hammering Hulk with a massive punch, which sent him flying into a tall building, knocking him out. Similarly, during the Contest of Champions when Thor sent Hulk flying with a strike from the Sakaaran hammer, Hulk was further enraged to the point that he managed to block the next hammer blow with a single hand. However, after Thor had his powers fully enhanced (from a vision of Odin's spirit), Hulk was visibly dazed by a single lightning-charged blow from Thor. Hulk's skin was also pierced and noticeably wounded by Fenris who bit him several times, forcing Hulk to throw him into the void. When fighting Thanos, Hulk managed to withstand many blows from the Mad Titan, despite being visibly affected and even bleeding because of the force of the Titan's blows, and soon thereafter be subdued, to the point where Hulk refused to transform back anymore. Hulk also was able to hold a full Infinity Gauntlet quite a while, though it badly damaged his right arm to the point where he needed a cast.
Superhuman Speed: Regardless of his size, Hulk's superhuman strength of his legs allow him to run at speeds that are far beyond the natural physical limits of a human being. He was fast enough to go toe-to-toe with abomination and quick enough to dodge some of Thor's attack in the Contest of Champions, but his large size can still be exploited by smaller foes to use to their advantage.
Superhuman Stamina: Hulk has substantially greater endurance than a normal human, allowing him to run and fight for extremely long periods of time. His enraged state, during a fight, allows him to maintain peak output for several days on end and still continue to become even stronger as his anger escalates.
Superhuman Reflexes: Hulk can react and dodge objects traveling at high speeds. During the Battle of Sokovia, his reflexes allow him to catch a supersonic Aircraft used by Ultron. During the Attack on the Helicarrier, Hulk also quick enough to catch an ejection seat from an Aircraft, and when he was in India, he caught a rocket - at short range fired by a mercenary thanks to his superhuman reflexes.
Regenerative Healing Factor: Should he receive damage that penetrates his extreme durability, his biology has a very high rate of cellular regeneration. Grievous bodily harm has also proven to be a trigger for Banner's transformations, and he has recovered from otherwise fatal injuries sustained in his normal form. Banner said he tried to put a bullet in his mouth but the "other guy" merely spit it out. Hulk also has an enhanced immune system; Samuel Sterns described that a synthesized sample of Banner's blood would make humans impervious to diseases. These attributes make him extremely difficult to kill, even if he is in his human form. Mere moments after his fight with Fenris in which Hulk suffers a deep puncture wound in his leg, no wound or scar tissue is seen. However, he did not yet regenerate immediately from the damage done by wielding the Nano Gauntlet, most likely due to the immense power of the Infinity Stones.
Hulk transforming back into Banner
Transformation: After being exposed to Gamma Radiation, Banner was able to willingly morph from his human form to his Hulk form. At first he couldn't control the transformations and as it was evidently painful and Hulk was a separate personality that Banner can only bring out if he was stressed. Very high heart rate (indicated by heart monitors as above 200 bpm) used to be the main trigger the transformation process. Therefore, stress was a huge factor in his transformations; if he was pissed off, fearful, or in huge pain, it could trigger an immediate Hulk transformation like during Loki’s Attack on the Helicarrier, where he knew Banner's instability and had a brainwashed Clint Barton, fire an explosive arrow at a turbine where Banner was nearby so the pain and anger would trigger his transformation and destroy the Helicarrier. However, after the Duel of Harlem, Banner had more control of his transformations after mastering meditation and emotional discipline but still sought to avoid them out of fear of losing control. He was able to quickly and willingly transform into Hulk in an instant during the Battle of New York, which demonstrated a Hulk with a temper that's aimed at the enemies and is able to battle efficiently side by side with his teammates. During the Ultron Offensive, which saw him attacking innocents after being manipulated by Scarlet Witch, Banner thought Hulk was a plague and sought to avoid more transformations, due to being haunted by regret and grief. But when he was stranded on Sakaar, he was away from anything that would calm him down and awaken Banner as he was constantly in battle as a gladiator, so he spent 2 years as Hulk, until Thor brought Banner back. After being defeated by Thanos, Hulk refused to come out, leaving Banner unable to access Hulk's powers. But after the Ambush on Thanos, Banner researched Gamma Radiation and found a way to keep his intelligence and personality, morphing his body into his Hulk Form. However, sometime after the Battle of Earth, he returned into his human form.
Iron Man Armor: Mark XLVIII Capabilities
Support Powers
Superhuman Strength: When inside the armor, it amplified Banner's physical strength, allowing him to match the incredible superhuman strength of Hulk. It has several Arc Reactors all over the suit. It was strong enough to kill many Outriders and despite sustaining heavy damage and losing the left arm, was still able to take on Cull Obsidian. It was even able to push the Mad Titan Thanos to the ground and deliver a blow to his face, although it should be noted that Thanos was greatly weakened due to the injuries on half of his body and his recently severed left arm.
Flight: With the repulsor technology included in the Mark XLVIII armor, Banner is able to utilize the repulsors in his suit to enable flight.
Heads Up Display (HUD): Like Stark's other armors, the suit contains a heads up display within the helmet to allow Banner to analyze the environment. He can utilize the display for targeting assistance.
Defensive Powers
Superhuman Durability: Banner's armor was meant to be stronger than any of the previous suits, to take more extreme damage, such as attacks from Cull Obsidian and the Outriders.
Offensive Powers
Repulsors: Besides flight, the repulsor technology in his suit enables Banner to battle offensively by unleashing energy blasts from his hands, similar to Iron Man and War Machine. They are capable of easily killing Outriders and stunning Cull Obsidian.
Former Powers
Nigh-Omnipotence: When he put on the Nano Gauntlet, it granted him nearly unlimited levels of power at the cost of damaging his arm.
Resurrection: With the power of the Infinity Stones, Hulk was able to snap his fingers and resurrect every life killed by Thanos during the Snap and bring them all back into 2023. Despite his best efforts, Hulk was only able to resurrect those killed by the Snap event, while unable to resurrect people killed in the events preceding or following it.
Universal Influence: With the Infinity Stones' power, Hulk's will to resurrect everyone had spread over a universal level, bringing back every life Thanos had decimated in the entire universe.

Abilities
Genius-level Intellect: Bruce Banner is among the smartest humans in the world, on par with Tony Stark's own level of intellect. Hence, Banner achieved his doctorate at Harvard University and worked as a biochemistry and nuclear physics professor as Culver University. Phil Coulson once compared him to Stephen Hawking, and Banner is one of the few modern scientists famous and prominent enough to be pictured in the science lab of Midtown School of Science and Technology. He has 7 PhDs, in nuclear physics, radiophysics, biochemistry, engineering, robotics, computer science and mathematics. Among them, he is the world's foremost expert on Gamma Radiation. Banner is also fairly disciplined in emotional intelligence, particularly in meditative breathing techniques and anger management, due to his experience with attempting to control and reign in his Hulk persona.
Banner beginning another experiment
Master Scientist: Banner is ingeniously resourceful and brilliant in many different fields of science, notably biochemistry and nuclear physics, being a former professor at Culver University, and one of the world's most renown scientists overall. Banner was able to replicate to a certain degree the Super Soldier Serum, a feat many other scientists were unable to accomplish. He also created the Tetrodotoxin B and Gamma Power Reserve, scientific devices that would be successfully used and complimented by S.H.I.E.L.D. for its uses. Indeed, even fellow genius Tony Stark admired Banner's brilliance, claiming that the latter's work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled, while Nick Fury referred to Banner as the world's foremost expert in gamma radiation. In addition, Stark needed Banner's assistance in downloading J.A.R.V.I.S. into Vision, due to Banner also being the world's foremost expert in the discipline of bio-organics. Stark himself admits to Banner surpassing him in the fields of radio-physics, particle collisions, and bio-organics although Banner also acknowledges to Stark surpassing him in the field of quantum physics. Banner's mastery of gamma-radiation even allowed him to, after 18 months inside a Gamma Lab, merge his intelligence and consciousness with Hulk's physical appearance and immense power into one being and he was able to deduce that the Infinity Stones mostly radiated Gamma Radiation, which would allow him to survive snapping his fingers to reverse the Snap.
Master Engineer: Banner, while not quite on par with Tony Stark, is an extremely skilled engineer, computer scientist, and robotics technician. Hence, Banner was able to help Stark construct the Hulkbuster, create the Ultron AI, and download J.A.R.V.I.S. into the Vision android and along with Rocket Raccoon and Tony, even create an Infinity Gauntlet that was, despite being made of nanites inferior to the Uru metal of the original, strong enough to withstand having him undo the Snap and allow him to survive.
Physician: Banner possesses enough medical knowledge to help the sick and injured while living in India.
Expert Tactician: Banner has over the years become an expert in developing strategies to go unnoticed and run from the government, military, and even S.H.I.E.L.D. by using his intellect to quickly evaluate his surroundings and develop feasible escape strategies. As such, Banner also became quite skilled at going undercover.
Banner puts Maximoff in a chokehold
Martial Artist: Banner learned Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Aikido and basic meditative breathing techniques in Brazil from a martial arts expert. By the time of the Battle of Wakanda, Banner seems to have undergone considerable improvement in skill, as he is able to defeat many Outriders and even hold his own and eventually best Cull Obsidian.
Pilot: Despite admitting himself that he does not know how to fly ships, Banner was nevertheless shown able to fly a couple of aircrafts, this being the Quinjet and an alien spaceship known as the Commodore just well enough to avoid any severe damage, although he struggles first. He also was able to pilot the Hulkbuster armor effectively despite having never used it before.
Multilingualism: Banner speaks his native English, as well as some Hindi, Spanish, and Portuguese. However, he only demonstrated fluency in Hindi, while in Kolkata, and had notable trouble with Spanish and Portuguese while in South America, occasionally mixing up words. According to his S.H.I.E.L.D. file, Banner can speak English, Latin, Portuguese, Malay, and Punjabi.
Hulk furiously fights against the Abomination
Expert Combatant: As Hulk, while having no formal training from the beginning, he is a formidable and experienced hand-to-hand combatant simply due to his great physical attributes. Hulk often engages his enemies using brawling techniques and street fighting skills that make full use of his incredible strength and also employs pieces of his immediate environment to fight with, often using them as range projectiles to strike distant targets, while sometimes for melee attacks or protection. While training and fighting in the Grandmaster's Contest of Champions, however, Hulk demonstrated much more combat skill than before, as he wielded a huge hammer and battle-axe like a common gladiator in the arena and his prowess allowed him to kill all of his competitors. His improved skills allowed him to compete against Thor himself, although Hulk had to rely on surprise attacks to gain the upper hand and when against the newly empowered Thor because simply, Thor was a lot smaller, faster and far more skilled than Hulk in a close quarter combat, Hulk was quickly outclassed and was only able to win due to The Grandmaster interfering with the battle to ensure Hulk won to keep Thor imprisoned. He also still depends on using his physical attributes to dominate in a hand-to-hand fight, with his style still having little subtlety and technique, which can prove to be a debilitating issue when confronted by opponents of equivalent, if not even superior physical power, with far greater experience, as against the even stronger Thanos, whose fighting experience was thousand years ahead of him, Hulk was able to land a few blows on the Titan until he was caught off-guard after Thanos recomposed himself, Hulk was no match for Thanos, who eventually beat him with aid of his combat skills and superior reflexes to ensure his victory. During the Battle of Earth, Hulk defeated whole hordes of Chitauri, Outriders and Sakaarans soldiers with relative ease despite his damaged arm from using the Nano Gauntlet.
Equipment
Weapons
Smith & Wesson Model 10: Banner used this revolver in his unsuccessful suicide attempt. He ended up shooting himself, but Hulk responded quickly enough to heal the damage and crush the gun.
Hulk using his Sakaaran Battle Axe
Sakaaran Battle Axe: As he became a gladiator, Hulk had gained a large special metallic battle axe that suitable to his own size.
Sakaaran War Hammer: With him as a gladiator, Hulk was given a massive war hammer made of a reporpused engine part that aids him with battling others in the arena.
Other Equipment
Wrist-Mounted Cardiovascular Monitor: A gauge used to monitor Banner's heart rate, helping him to prevent a transformation into Hulk. The first monitor was destroyed after Banner's transformation in Brazil. The last one seen was given by Betty Ross and seized by United States Army.
Encrypted Laptop Computer: A cheap laptop with an encrypted instant messaging software installed. Banner used it to chat with Samuel Sterns. Banner always carried it in a backpack, so he could maintain a communication where he was. The laptop was lost during a scuffle with a group of thugs while Banner was attempting to escape military capture in Brazil.
Stretchable Pants: After the Battle of New York, Bruce Banner became a consecrated member of the Avengers, he acquired a uniform with the main feature of stretching to fit his Hulk physique after his transformations. He uses a pair of trousers made with flexible microfiber fabric, the material of which was shown to be extremely durable on several occasions, like when the team attacked the HYDRA Research Base, Banner turned back into Hulk with his pants still intact.
Banner inside the Iron Man Armor: Mark XLVIII
Iron Man Armor: Mark XLVIII: Since Hulk refused to come back following his defeat by Thanos, Banner had to use the Hulkbuster 2.0 Armor of Tony Stark to fight Thanos' army during the Battle of Wakanda. He uses the armor a second time during the Ambush on Thanos. Banner used the Hulkbuster without an internal Iron Man armor.
Hulk's Stretchable Suit: Suit, worn by Hulk, with the main feature of stretching to fit his physical form.
Transmitter Pager: A communication device used by Nick Fury, an ordinary Earth pager modified by Carol Danvers using Kree technology for use as an instrument of last resort in extreme emergencies. Fury was eventually forced to use it in response to the Snap. It was found by the Avengers.
Advanced Tech Suit: This suit was designed in order to time travel through the Quantum Realm safely. It is a white, red and black suit that materialize around the wearer's regular clothes, managing to be summoned when time travel is required again, and disappear when no longer in use. It has size-shifting adaptability down to subatomic levels and a wrist gadget that allows for displacement through time and space.
Nano Gauntlet: After retrieving the Infinity Stones through the Time Heist, Banner, Stark, and Rocket created the Nano Gauntlet to harness the power of the Stones in order to revive everyone that Thanos killed. Banner volunteered to use the gauntlet due to his resistance to the Stones' immense radiation and succeeded with the cost of his right arm severely burned.
Vehicles
Acura 2012 Stark Industries Super Car: After winning the Battle of New York, the Avengers gathered together in Central Park to witness Thor and Loki teleport to Asgard. Banner then left with Tony Stark in the Acura 2012 Stark Industries Super Car.
Quinjet: Banner has used a Quinjet for transportation to travel around the world and take out threats during active missions as a member of the Avengers. Following the Battle of Sokovia, Hulk left Earth in a Quinjet against the request of Natasha Romanoff. He would end up on Sakaar after entering a wormhole where the Quinjet remained inactive for 2 years before being abandoned by Banner.
Commodore: Bruce Banner and the other Revengers stole the Grandmaster's ship to escape Sakaar. Bruce Banner briefly piloted the Commodore, taking over from Valkyrie, who left to attack the Grandmaster's forces pursuing them.
Statesman: Hulk was present on the Statesmen, witnessing Ragnarök and the crowning of Thor as the new King of Asgard. Eventually, Thanos attacked the Statesman with the Sanctuary II and killed half of the passengers. Hulk waited to ambush Thanos, but was quickly beaten by the Mad Titan before being sent to Earth by Heimdall.
Benatar: Banner and the Avengers used this ship to travel to the Garden to undo the Snap and kill Thanos.

Trivia

Banner appeared in the non-canon short film Team Thor, where he met Thor in a café and they discussed why the latter had not been invited to the Avengers Civil War.

Behind the Scenes
Hulk's origin in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a combination of the Ultimate comics version, where his transformation was the result of an attempt to recreate the Super Soldier Serum and 1970s television version, who was overexposed to gamma radiation on a Gamma Ray Projector.
Hulk was first indirectly referenced in an alternate version of the post-credits scene for Iron Man, in which Nick Fury mentioned to Tony Stark about "gamma accidents" on the "bigger universe" he has become part. This version ultimately went unused from the finished film likely because it included indirect mentions to Spider-Man and the X-Men, characters whose film rights were owned by Sony Pictures Studios and 20th Century Fox.
An alternate opening sequence scene was shot for The Incredible Hulk, though it was eventually cut from the final draft of the movie. In the scene, Banner travels to the Arctic to die by suicide due to his incurable Hulk transformations. Banner shoots himself in the mouth, which only serves to trigger his transformation into Hulk, whose appearance destroys the glacier he was on. This scene is still considered canon because it is referenced in The Avengers by Banner.
Bruce Banner is one of the few characters who were played by different actors in different films. The others are James Rhodes, Howard Stark, Fandral, Thanos, Red Skull and Cassie Lang.
In The Incredible Hulk, Banner is given a mailed package with the name "David B." on it. This is a reference to the TV series The Incredible Hulk, where the character was renamed to David Bruce Banner.
Before Edward Norton was cast as Bruce Banner/Hulk and was later replaced by Mark Ruffalo for future films. David Duchovny, Dominic Purcell and Joaquin Phoenix were also considered.
Mark Ruffalo was uncredited for his appearances in Iron Man 3, Captain Marvel and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.
To prepare for the role of Hulk in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ruffalo worked with motion capture expert Andy Serkis.
There was an idea for Hulk to turn gray during the Hulkbuster battle in Avengers: Age of Ultron, as a reference to his original comic book incarnation, but it went unused.
Loki using Hulk to attack the Helicarrier is a reference to Loki using Hulk to destroy a train track to lure out Thor, and unwillingly creating the Avengers in the process in the main Marvel Comics Universe.
Mark Ruffalo was written into Captain America: Civil War but was removed as Marvel felt Hulk's current whereabouts were too huge to be revealed in the packed film; he did, however, make a very short cameo on video.
J.B. Blanc, J.D. Hall, Fred Tatasciore, and Jonathan Lipow all provided voiceover work for Hulk in The Incredible Hulk, though none of them were credited.
Hulk in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the third live-action incarnation of the character, following incarnations portrayed by Bill Bixby (Bruce Banner) and Lou Ferrigno (Hulk) and by Eric Bana.
Chad Camilleri, Jamie Jones and Cyril Raffaelli were stunt doubles for Edward Norton and Anthony Molinari, Troy Brenna, Josh Dyer, Clint Elvy, Ryan Tarran and Carmelo Oquendo were stunt doubles for Mark Ruffalo in the role of Hulk.
Matt Purdy was a stand-in for Edward Norton in the role of Hulk.
On Hulk's advanced ability to talk in Thor: Ragnarok, Mark Ruffalo explained: "Hulk refuses to turn back into Banner, He's actually enjoying his time on Sakaar, because he's a gladiator champion. Which means he kicks lots of ass and he's enjoying his life for once. And he'll be damned if he goes back to Banner. He's a little perma-hulked, and because he's been Hulk for two years he has the vocab of a two-year-old."
Taika Waititi said that: "I was always fascinated with the duality of Hulk and Banner, and seeing how their brains could be interconnected. Could we sometimes see Hulk and have a bit of Banner's voice in there? Could we see Banner and have Hulk's personality through there? I think in this film we're going to see that for the first time, where the two are fighting -- really fighting this time -- for control over the body. And Hulk talking -- this idea of a more cognitive Hulk who can say sentences -- that obviously has existed in the comics, but it's something the fans want to finally see. It's exactly what fans want to see, and what I have wanted to see."
According to Mark Ruffalo, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame make up a trilogy for Hulk.</p></html>
