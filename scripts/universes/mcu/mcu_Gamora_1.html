Gamora is a former Zehoberei assassin and a former member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. She became the adopted daughter of Thanos and adopted sister of Nebula after he killed half of her race. Gamora served him for years before betraying him in an attempt to free herself from his ways. She was hired to steal the Orb, and after becoming involved in the Quest for the Orb, she befriended the other members of the Guardians of the Galaxy. After the Battle of Xandar, she left to work with them all. Having made a deal with the Sovereign to kill the Abilisk, Gamora was able to regain custody of Nebula with the intention of finally bringing her to justice in Xandar.

However, her mission to punish Nebula was delayed when Gamora and the Guardians came into contact with Ego, the long-lost father of Star-Lord. While Ego claimed he simply wanted to bond with his son, Gamora was suspicious and, alongside Nebula who had freed herself, discovered Ego's evil intentions to destroy and rebuild the universe. Upon this discovery, the Guardians teamed up to destroy the living planet, succeeding with the help of Mantis, who joined the group, but at the cost of Yondu Udonta sacrificing his life. After Udonta's death, Gamora finally confessed that she had romantic feelings for Star-Lord and started a relationship with him.

Four years later, Gamora and the Guardians intercepted a distress call sent by Asgardians; Thor warned them that Thanos had begun searching for the Infinity Stones himself. Realizing what Thanos intended to do with them, Gamora led her friends to Knowhere to procure the Aether, only for both it and Gamora to be captured by Thanos himself. Thanos took Gamora to Vormir, where he sacrificed her against her will in order to obtain the Soul Stone, a process that trapped Gamora's soul inside the Soulworld.

In 2023, the Time Heist orchestrated by the Avengers with the intention of undoing the Snap inadvertently enabled the 2014 versions of Gamora and Thanos to learn how the future would unfold, causing a major divergence from the established timeline. Acting upon the obtained intelligence, Thanos successfully brought his armies from 2014 to the future where Gamora eventually turned against him after learning her tragic future before helping the Avengers and their allies to defeat him once and for all. After surviving the battle, Gamora fled, with Quill and the other Guardians searching for her.

Biography
Raised by Thanos
Growing Up on Zen-Whoberi
Gamora and her mother hide from the Chitauri
When Gamora was very young, the interplanetary warlord Thanos killed half of her species, the Zehoberei. Although she and her mother attempted to hide, they were quickly found by Thanos' soldiers and taken out to the spotlight. Gamora fought off the soldier restraining her, an act that Thanos himself saw, which earned her the Titan's interest in her and his respect at her fierce nature. He took her aside and taught her his beliefs on balance by symbolizing it by balancing a knife on his finger.

Gamora is adopted by Thanos
While asking her to do the same, Ebony Maw ordered the Chitauri to balance the population. When his soldiers began the massacre, Gamora turned and almost saw her people being massacred. However, Thanos turned her attention back onto the knife and complimented her when she finally balanced the dagger. While her parents were among those killed, Thanos spared and raised her as his own child.

Deadliest Woman in the Galaxy
As Gamora was taken in by Thanos and grew older, Thanos trained her in the arts of combat and assassination and would cybernetically alter her body, trying to transform her into the ultimate weapon. She was also trained by Ronan the Accuser alongside Korath and Nebula. Unlike the rest of Thanos' adopted children in the Black Order, Gamora and Nebula actually did consider each other sisters and both shared great enmity towards Thanos for destroying their childhoods.

Despite their closeness, Thanos had Nebula and Gamora regularly spar against each other with Gamora winning every match. In response, Thanos would 'upgrade' Nebula every time she lost against Gamora in order for her to "be her equal." The consistent and brutal "upgrades" caused Nebula to grow to resent her sister. Over the years, Gamora became Thanos' favorite child and he considered her the future heir to his throne, which only strengthened the growing wedge in her relationship with Nebula and in time, Gamora built up the reputation as the "deadliest woman in the galaxy" and became well known throughout the cosmos.

Gamora in her early years of serving Thanos
Upon reaching adulthood, Gamora and her siblings were tasked with finding the Infinity Stones, with Thanos entrusting her to find the Soul Stone. She succeeded when she found a map leading to its location on Vormir but she burned it and lied to Thanos that she failed, although Thanos was aware of the lie but he remained silent and played a disappointed farce. Later, Gamora and Nebula sought the powerful item known as the Orb for Thanos under the command of Korath. 

Gamora traveled to the Conjunction. After having arrived on the planet, Gamora went to the casino and engaged in a brawl with several other individuals who attempted to rob her. After having incapacitated them, Gamora was contacted by Taneleer Tivan who hired her to acquire the Orb which he sought to add to his collection and offered to pay her four billion units. Gamora ultimately accepted the job, and began to search for the Orb.

On the planet Praxius IX, while following a false lead on the Orb, Nebula found herself ensnared by an impenetrable Laser Thorn Energy Net. Under Thanos' orders, Gamora left Nebula behind, leaving her only a large knife with which to cut herself out of the netting. The experience drove a great wedge between the two sisters, and also strengthened Gamora's bitterness towards Thanos.

Quest for the Orb
Family Conquests
Gamora saves Nebula's life
In 2014, Gamora participated in the cleansing of the population of Korbin along with Thanos and Nebula. However, Nebula was almost executed by a Korbinite soldier who held her at gunpoint, causing Gamora to rescue her at the last minute. As she offered a helping hand, Nebula sighed at Gamora's effort and claimed not to have needed help, only for Gamora to remind her that she always needed backup.

Gamora and Nebula await Thanos' arrival
After the massacre ended, Gamora and Nebula returned to one of Thanos' Q-Ships to await further instructions. Gamora soon discovered from her adopted father that he has located the Power Stone on the desolate planet, Morag. When Nebula pointed out that Thanos has finally put his plan of gathering the Infinity Stones in effect, Gamora assured her that Thanos only knew the location of the Power Stone, and not the others. 

Gamora receiving instructions from Thanos
However, Nebula then lamented the possibility of Thanos obtaining all six Infinity Stones to Gamora. At that moment, Thanos appeared on the Q-Ship as he was cleaning his double-edged sword, before informing Gamora and Nebula that he was dispatching them to the Dark Aster, which belonged to his Kree ally, Ronan the Accuser, who promised to retrieve the Orb containing the Power Stone in exchange for the annihilation of Xandar, the capital of the Nova Empire, which Ronan desired revenge against for their actions against the Kree Empire. 

Gamora and Nebula listen to Thanos
Gamora pointed out that Ronan would not like that. Thanos, however, warned the two that Ronan's alternative was death if they refused to join him in his quest to obtain the Power Stone, noting that his obsession with the Kree-Nova War had clouded his judgments. Nebula then promised Thanos that she would not fail him in her mission while Gamora looked away at her sister's attempt to appease her father's demand.

Betraying Ronan
Gamora and Nebula on board the Dark Aster
Thanos and Ronan's alliance was the final straw for Gamora, who was unwilling to assist the two in killing billions of innocent lives. Remembering her negotiation with Taneleer Tivan, Gamora formulated a plan to steal the Orb for herself so she could disappear from Thanos and Ronan forever. Following the Massacre of the Korbinites, Gamora and Nebula boarded the Dark Aster as Korath the Pursuer returned to the ship.

Gamora listens to Korath the Pursuer's failure
Gamora was later present with Ronan and Nebula when Korath updated his failure to retrieve the Orb from Morag to Ronan and revealed the identity of the thief who stole the Power Stone: Star-Lord, whom Korath surmised planned to exchange the Orb on Xandar to the Broker. Ronan, remembering that Thanos promised to assist him in the annihilation of Xandar for retrieving the Orb for him, appointed Nebula to retrieve the Orb from Quill. 

Gamora being sent down to Xandar by Ronan
Knowing that the Orb falling into the hands of Ronan or Thanos would spell doom for the galaxy, Gamora offered Ronan to send her instead, reminding him that if Nebula failed, he would have subjected to the burden of reporting his failure to Thanos. Nebula, however, insisted that she was worthy of being Thanos' daughter as well. Ronan agreed that Gamora should execute the task, knowing that she never failed any mission she had been given by Thanos, although he threatened her with severe punishment if she failed.

Gamora having another argument with Nebula
As she left, Gamora was attacked by Nebula, who accused her of intending to continue to stand above her despite Nebula having killed so many that their screams echoed through the entire Galaxy, which Gamora coldly retorted by saying the reason why was because Nebula took to long to kill them compared to Gamora's swift approach, and they fight until Gamora pinned Nebula to a wall and left.

Gamora kills Sakaarans on her way to Xandar
After having departed from the Dark Aster, Gamora boarded a Necrocraft with a team of Sakaarans. While they set traveled to Xandar, the leader of the Sakaarans expressed his profound gratitude for being allowed to work with one of Thanos and Ronan's pupils. Gamora agreed but instead hinted that there would be casualties on the ship. She then proceeded to murder every single Sakaaran guard with her on the ship.

Meeting Star-Lord
Gamora finds Star-Lord to steal the Orb
Having arrived on Xandar, Gamora traced the Orb to Peter Quill who was an associate of the Ravagers. Pursuing him to Xandar, Gamora waited for his meeting with the Broker to finish outside his shop so she could steal the Orb by surprise. As he walked out furious, Gamora asked him what happened as she put on lipstick. He then proceeded to explain that the Broker reneged on their deal before introducing himself as Star-Lord to the Zehoberei. Remembering that Star-Lord was the thief who stole the Orb on Morag, Gamora decided to finally steal the Orb and she immediately attacked Quill.

Gamora viciously duels Star-Lord
As Gamora fled the scene, however, Star-Lord threw Energy Bolas to subdue her. As he caught up to her, however, Gamora already freed herself, and the two engaged in a brief hand-to-hand combat on the ground. As she gained the upper hand in the fight and prepared to kill Quill, however, bounty hunters Rocket Raccoon and Groot intervened, who also sought Quill who had a high bounty on his head from Yondu Udonta.

Gamora is temporarily restrained by Groot
While Rocket Raccoon restrained Gamora, Groot, mistaking her for the target, extended his branches and put her in the bag, despite Rocket ordering Groot to abduct Quill. While the two argued, Star-Lord attempted to escape while Gamora threw Rocket into an open glass store and freed herself. Unwilling to let the Orb fall into the hands of a third party, Gamora threw one of her knives in Quill's direction, which caused the Orb to fall to the ground floor.

Gamora stabs Groot to finish him off
She then immediately attacked Groot with her sword before jumping to the first floor to escape with the Orb. To her surprise, however, Star-Lord caught up to her and the two engaged in another fight. During this fight, she called him a fool, telling him that he should have learned not to mess with her. Star-Lord agreed and managed to place one of his Jet Boot Attachments on her clothes which sent her flying backward.  

Gamora being arrested by the Nova Corps
Meanwhile, Rocket Raccoon and Groot abducted Quill. To Rocket Raccoon's horror, Gamora appeared in front of him with her sword and aggressively pushed him aside before cutting off both Groot's arms. With the two bounty hunters defeated, she finally attempted to regain the Orb and opened the bag which contained a captured Quill. However, Star-Lord used his gun to knock Gamora out before the Nova Corps intervened and arrested the four for civil disruption.

Imprisoned in the Kyln
Gamora is arrested by the Nova Corps
The four were then shipped off-world and sent to the Kyln for incarceration. As they made their way through the prison under armed guards, Peter Quill demanded to know what was so special about the Orb, but Gamora refused to answer. Rocket Raccoon then antagonized her by reminding her of her crimes across the galaxy. Gamora then witnessed Quill getting assaulted when he attempted to get his Walkman back from a guard.

Gamora arrives in the Kyln to be imprisoned
Having stepped into the prison, every inmate immediately turned their attention to Gamora, taunting her with threats and throwing rubbish at her. Rocket explained it was due to many of the inmates have lost their families to Thanos and Ronan the Accuser. Despite the endless threats, Gamora remained calm, telling Quill that nothing she could experience here would compare to what she had experienced while working for Thanos.

Gamora is threatened while inside the Kyln
The same night, a guard allowed Moloka Dar and a team of angry prisoners who wished to murder her into her cell, and they ambushed her while she slept and put a knife to her throat. She was then dragged out of her cell by the prisoners and was about to be killed when she found herself being saved by Drax the Destroyer, whose family had been murdered by Ronan. Instead, Drax explained that he wished to kill Gamora himself to briefly satisfy his hatred.

Gamora threatens Drax the Destroyer
At the instance of hearing Drax claim that Gamora was a family to Ronan, Gamora proved to him that she was no longer affiliated to Ronan or Thanos as she immediately attacked Drax, Moloka Dar, and two other prisoners who were holding her at knifepoint. Holding the knives up to Moloka Dar and Drax, she angrily told him that she was not family with Ronan and suggested that she was his only hope at stopping Ronan's plans from coming to fruition.

Drax the Destroyer nearly executes Gamora
However, Drax disarmed her and held the knife up to her neck, claiming that her words meant nothing to him. Seeing this, Star-Lord intervened and reminded Drax that Gamora wanted Ronan dead as much as she did and persuaded him to exact his revenge on Ronan instead of killing Gamora. While initially distrustful of each other, Gamora offered to split Tivan's payment with Quill, Rocket, and Groot if they assisted her in escaping from the prison.

Escape from the Kyln
Gamora fighting during the Kyln prison break
The next day, Rocket Raccoon came up with a plan to get them out of the prison, which involved stealing an inmate's false leg, a guard's security band, and a Quardrix battery. Groot accidentally started their escape early and Gamora focused her efforts on getting the guard's armband. She quickly found the guard who almost allowed Moloka Dar to murder her and ripped it from his arm as the two exchanged words with each other.

Gamora making her escape from the Kyln
With the armband ready, Gamora rejoined the rest of the group in the prison's control terminal, she found that they had been joined by Drax the Destroyer who wished to stay with her until they found Ronan the Accuser. At first, Gamora furiously inquired the others as to why Drax was with them, only to be dismissed. However, several Nova guards defending the prison attempted to shoot at the control terminal in hopes of eliminating the five.

The Guardians of the Galaxy escape the Kyln
However, the criminals completed their escape when Rocket turned off the anti-gravity in the prison and flew the prison terminal outside. As Gamora looked in surprise and shock at the success of Rocket's plan, they then fled the Kyln to the Milano. However, Quill insisted upon staying behind to collect his Walkman, which was stolen from him the day he arrived at the intergalactic prison. As a sign of trust, he left the Orb with Gamora and the other former criminals as they waited in his ship for him to retrieve his taken belongings.

Gamora waits for Star-Lord in the Milano
The group waited for Quill while flying outside of the prison, however, Rocket insisted that they leave without him. Gamora refused when she realized that Quill had not in fact given her the Orb, but kept it with him. Rocket continued to demand they leave before their ship was shot out of space by the Nova Corps, whom he surmised were alerted to the Kyln. However, Gamora insisted that they not leave without the Orb.

Gamora is asked about the Orb by Peter Quill
Quill emerged a few minutes later, flying across space and onto the ship. He gave Gamora the real Orb before informing Drax that he had left to collect his Walkman, which resulted in Drax calling Quill an imbecile. As they headed to Knowhere to meet Gamora's buyer, On the Milano, Star-Lord interrogated Gamora about what was inside the Orb and why it was coveted by so many parties including Ronan the Accuser before he offered her his theory that it contained a powerful weapon. Although Gamora knew that it contained the Power Stone, she claimed not to know what it truly was as she was untrustworthy of him and the others.

Gamora, Peter Quill and Drax discuss the Orb
As the group discussed what was to be done with the Orb, Drax the Destroyer suggested that if it was a weapon they should use it to kill Ronan. Gamora looked at him in shock and instructed him to put it down as the Orb's power had the capability to destroy all of them and even the Milano. A furious Drax then insisted that it would only destroy her, calling her a "murderess," which thus lead to a fierce argument between her and Drax.

The Guardians of the Galaxy enter Knowhere
Quill calmed the situation down insisting that no one must kill anyone on board his ship. Gamora refused to give Quill any more information about where they were going or who her buyer was, leading to Quill telling her that she should begin trusting him more, Gamora told Quill she would never work with someone like him and then mocked him by telling him that his ship was filthy.

Trouble on Knowhere
The Guardians of the Galaxy arrive on Knowhere
After they arrive on Knowhere, a remote criminal outpost in space built in the giant severed head of a Celestial, Gamora explains to the Guardians that Knowhere was a mining colony owned by the Tivan Group, which sent workers to mine the organic matter in the Celestial's skull. The colony also became a hub for outlaws.

Gamora being seduced by Peter Quill's music
The group decided to relax while waiting to meet the Collector. Gamora and Peter Quill shared a brief moment while she cleaned her sword where Quill explained his need to get his Walkman back due to it being a gift from his mother. Gamora then explained to Quill that she was no longer loyal to Ronan or Thanos because he killed her parents and turned her into an assassin. Quill then let Gamora listen to the music and tried to seduce her, which ended with Gamora harshly rejecting Quill, as she was aware of his reputation.

Gamora holding back Drax the Destroyer
Their conversation was interrupted when a fight broke out between the drunk Rocket Raccoon, Groot, and Drax the Destroyer after the latter called Rocket vermin and Rocket mocked Drax's past. Quill and Gamora were able to break up the fight and convinced Rocket to put down his weapon and wait until they had collected their money from the Collector. Drax, however, refused and stormed off, due to being furious that he had still been unable to kill Ronan the Accuser, while Gamora let him go as she felt that they did not need his help.

Meeting the Collector
Gamora is finally summoned by Carina
Some time later, Carina finally chooses to summon the Guardians of the Galaxy to the Collector to negotiate the payment. While Drax stayed back, the Guardians followed the Collector's servant as she toured them through his museum, which contained various types of species, fauna, and mysterious objects from all over the galaxy. She then, at last, introduced the four to the Collector, who greeted Gamora with a kiss to the hand, noting how wonderful it was to finally meet her in person. Insistent upon the negotiation, Gamora suggested that they skip the formalities.

Gamora meets the Collector about the Orb
However, Tivan became distracted by Groot as he had never seen a member of Groot's species before and intended to add him to his collection. This irked Rocket Raccoon who pulled out his weapon at the instance of hearing Tivan calling him Groot's pet. Gamora then reminded Tivan that they had been halfway across the universe searching for the Orb and suggested that they continue what they had come to discuss. Star-Lord then pulled the Orb from his jacket pocket and attempted to hand it to the Collector, only to briefly drop it on the floor.

Gamora learns about the Infinity Stones
Tivan showed great enthusiasm as he began to open the Orb, explaining that the Orb was a containment device that held the Power Stone. Tivan showed the incredible power of the Infinity Stones which had been used by Eson the Searcher thousands of years before to destroy entire planets, as well as the Cosmic Beings, who attempted to harness its power, only for the Infinity Stone to destroy them. As Tivan ended the story, the Power Stone was extracted from the Orb to reveal its true appearance.

Gamora and Star-Lord escape from the Collector's Museum moments after its destruction
Rocket Raccoon, who expressed boredom at Tivan's lecture of the Power Stone's history, demanded the four be paid so they could leave Knowhere. Before the group could accept their payment, the Collector observed Carina attempted to take the Stone and use it's power to free herself from bondage. As she claimed that she was no longer Tivan's slave, however, she touched the stone, which massive explosion that killed herself and destroyed much of Tivan's collection.

The Guardians leave the Collector's Museum
Barely escaping with their lives, Gamora hastily resealed the stone into the Orb and promptly left the destroyed museum along with Star-Lord, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot. As she shamed herself for believing that Tivan could contain the Power Stone in his vault, an appalled Rocket asked what she was doing with it, after having realized the true destructive natures of the Power Stone, and berated Quill for hiding it in his belongings.

Gamora and Star-Lord argue about the Orb
Surmising that Ronan would obliterate the Nova Corps if he discovered what was inside the Orb, Gamora decided to deliver the Orb to the Nova Corps where it would be safest. Rocket Raccoon was horrified when he saw that they were keeping it and suggested that they give it to Ronan the Accuser as a peace offering, Star-Lord then suggested that they give it to a friend of his who would offer a great payment for it. Gamora was furious at the suggestion and attempted to leave with the Orb.

Skirmish on Knowhere
Gamora is confronted by Ronan the Accuser and Nebula
Before Gamora could escape, Ronan the Accuser, Nebula, and a platoon of Sakaaran soldiers s suddenly arrived, having been summoned to Knowhere by Drax the Destroyer who intended to kill him in an act of revenge for murdering his family on Kylos. However, at the same time, the Ravagers led by Yondu Udonta also arrived at the space colony,  having been given the location of the Collector from the Broker. Yondu located Star-Lord and attempted to capture him for his betrayal. As she watched in horror as Ronan confronted Drax, Gamora decided to escape with the Orb and bestow it to the Nova Corps for safekeeping.

Gamora attempts to flee from Nebula during the Skirmish on Knowhere
Gamora then piloted a mining pod and attempted to flee from Knowhere and return the Orb to Xandar. While Drax fought Ronan on Knowhere, Nebula was instructed to retrieve the Orb. As Gamora flew away, Nebula and a platoon of Sakaarans began pursuing her, prompting Star-Lord and Rocket Raccoon to follow her from close behind, while Groot stayed on Knowhere. In the ensuing chaos, Nebula continued to engage Gamora in an aerial battle, at one point overwhelming her.

Gamora nearly suffocates in deep space
Despite that Gamora managed to shoot down several Necrocraft ships with the help of Rocket Raccoon and Star-Lord, she was ultimately forced to fly her mining pod into deep space where it malfunctioned and she became trapped. As she approached deep space, Nebula claimed that Gamora was a disappointment, stating that out of all of their siblings in the Black Order, she hated her least. Gamora tried to reason with her sister, insisting that if Ronan got his hands on the Orb, he would kill everyone in the universe.

Gamora is rescued by Star-Lord
Nebula refused to listen to her sister's pleas, asserting that she would not have to witness Ronan's malevolent use of the Power Stone against the universe. Nebula sentenced Gamora to death and proceeded to destroy Gamora's ship, resulting in her being blown into deep space. As Gamora started to suffocate, Nebula left her for dead and stole the Orb, which was stagnating in space, and traveled back to Knowhere to pick up Ronan.

Gamora realizes that Nebula stole the Orb
Quill put his mask on Gamora's face to save her life. Ultimately, the two were picked up by Yondu's ravager clan. Gamora regained consciousness and found herself with Peter on the Eclector. While he was bragging about his heroic deeds, Gamora asked where the Orb was only to discover that Nebula stole it. Before she could react, the two were confronted by Kraglin Obfonteri and several Ravagers who held them at gunpoint and took them into custody.

Joining Forces
Gamora sees Yondu Udonta's interrogation
As they were saved by the Yondu Ravager Clan, Yondu Udonta immediately began beating up Peter Quill in revenge for him betraying the Ravagers. Eventually, Gamora managed to convince Udonta of the danger the Orb posed in Ronan's hands. In the end, he agreed to help them in retaking the Orb from Ronan, who was now making his way to Xandar to destroy it.

Gamora and Peter Quill explain their plan
Their conversation was interrupted when Rocket Raccoon and Drax the Destroyer threatened to blow up the ship if Udonta did not give Quill and Gamora back to them. With the situation quickly resolved, Gamora and Quill spoke with Rocket, Groot, and Drax, Gamora on board the Milano and tried to convince them to join them and the Ravagers in a final battle against Ronan the Accuser to save the Xandarians from the hands of the Kree sadist.

The Guardians of the Galaxy prepare to fight
Quill pitched his idea of a plan, but the group was not convinced, as it would likely result in their deaths. In the end, however, Gamora told Quill she would be happy to die with her friends and the rest of the group also agreed, having been around her enemies most of her life. Quill and Gamora explained the details of the plan to Udonta and his clan, with Gamora explaining how they would engage his army of Sakaarans and use the distraction to board the ship where her knowledge of the layout would help them find and kill Ronan. They also made it clear how deadly the Power Stone was and how Ronan must not be allowed to touch the planet's surface as it would result in its destruction. The Ravagers were handing containment Orbs to use to steal the stone back.

Gamora joined in the Battle of Xandar, taking a seat in the Milano with Star-Lord, Groot and Drax the Destroyer, as they prepared to engage Ronan the Accuser, Gamora noted that it was a terrible plan. While Yondu Udonta and the Ravagers provided a distraction for Nebula, the Guardians of the Galaxy started to dive underneath the Dark Aster. During the battle, they became overrun with the Sakaarans' ships and seemed overpowered until the Nova Corps arrived, led by Garthan Saal and assisted them in the battle.

The Guardians infiltrating the Dark Aster
Gamora and her allies infiltrated the Dark Aster. However, Yondu Udonta's ship was shot down in the chaos. As the Milano crashed through the ship, Quill was able to shoot down a large unit of Sakaarans guarding the ship before they prepared to carry on. As they made their way through the ship, it was almost too dark for them to see, so Groot demonstrated how he could create light spores to light their way. As they walked, Drax expressed his gratitude to be welcomed back into their group.

Gamora witnesses Drax shooting Nebula
He even claimed Gamora to be a friend although he mistakenly called Gamora a green whore causing her to demand that he stop talking. Suddenly, Nebula attacked the four with the intent of protecting Ronan the Accuser and getting revenge for the destruction Gamora had caused. Appearing in front of them armed with her electroshock batons, Nebula claimed that Gamora was weak and traitorous before being shot by Drax the Destroyer.

Sister vs. Sister
Gamora attempts to plead with Nebula
Gamora parted ways with the three and went to disable the ship's generators. As she reached the room containing the generators, she was confronted by Nebula, who had survived her injuries after having been shot by Drax the Destroyer. As Gamora attempted to reason with Nebula, however, she instead attacked her with her electroshock batons.

Gamora fights Nebula
After pushing Nebula away, Gamora rushed to the ship generator, only for Nebula to briefly electrocute her. With no other choice, Gamora was forced to engage Nebula. The two sisters fought each other, with Gamora defending herself with her Godslayer and Nebula with her electroshock batons, while the Battle of Xandar raged on. Ultimately, Ronan the Accuser used the Power Stone to destroy the Nova Corps' blockade around the Dark Aster.

Gamora is overwhelmed by Nebula
An explosion created a hole in the ship, which interrupted their fight. Ultimately, as they continued to fight, Nebula gained the upper hand, after having weakened her defenses. After Gamora lost her weapon, Nebula seized the opportunity to finally kill her sister, and she started to electrocute and almost kill her. However, Gamora regained all of her strength and was able to kick Nebula off the side of the ship through a hole that had been shot in it.

Gamora attempting to rescue Nebula
Nebula managed to hold on as her cybernetic arm became impaled on the piece of debris and hung thousands of feet above Xandar, Gamora attempted to reason with her sister by telling her that Ronan the Accuser was crazy and they could still stop him. Nebula refused to listen, citing that they were both crazy, and instead cut off her own arm and fell from the ship, landing on M-Ship, throwing the pilot out, and flying it to safety.

Crashing on Xandar
Gamora finally disables the security door
With Nebula having been defeated, Gamora then disabled the shield generator of Dark Aster as planned, allowing the rest of the group to enter the control room, with the three having killed Korath the Pursuer. She then joined her friends in confronting Ronan. As she faced her former ally, Ronan glanced at them as Star-Lord prepared to use the Hadron Enforcer to kill him. As he shot Ronan through the chest, the four of them waited for a second to make sure that Ronan was dead.

The Guardians of the Galaxy finally attempt to kill Ronan the Accuser
To Gamora's horror, however, Ronan's power was too great, having harnessed the Power Stone from earlier, and he survived. Ronan then used his Cosmi-Rod to knock the group back and easily subdued them. Gamora watched as Drax attempted to kill Ronan once again, only for him to effortlessly strangle the Kylosian, as the Kree reversed his statement earlier from the Skirmish on Knowhere to Drax, and affirmed that he indeed remembered killing his family, describing their screams as pitiful.

Gamora is protected from the crash by Groot
They were saved when Rocket Raccoon dive-bombed his ship into the Dark Aster, plowing straight into Ronan and causing the ship to plummet from the Xandarian skyline. All seemed lost as the group had no means of protecting themselves from the impact when the ship to crash land. However, Groot sacrificed himself to keep the others safe from the crash, wrapping them in a protective ball made from his own body.

Killing Ronan
Gamora crashes on Xandar
The group survived the impact, although Groot's body was destroyed and he was seemingly killed. Ronan the Accuser survived the crash as well and began mocking the group's efforts to stop him, calling them the Guardians of the Galaxy. Ronan prepared to finally unleash his revenge and destroy Xandar while Gamora and the rest of the group seemed powerless to stop him. Much to everyone's surprise, Peter Quill decided to start dancing and singing, distracting Ronan who was confused by the strange display. 

The Guardians of the Galaxy harness the Power Stone
Using this momentary distraction, Rocket Raccoon was able to repair the Hadron Enforcer and Drax the Destroyer used it to destroy Ronan's Cosmi-Rod, exposing the Power Stone within. Quill grabbed the stone but was almost killed by its power while a sinister Ronan watched with a grin. Watching as Quill's body started to rip apart due to the effects of possessing the Infinity Stone, Gamora asked him to hold her hand, so she could also harness it. As he hallucinated his dying mother, Quill took her hand, and she screamed in agony and pain as the Power Stone consumed her.

The Guardians of the Galaxy destroy Ronan the Accuser
Ultimately, Drax the Destroyer and Rocket Raccoon became exposed to the Power Stone after having exchanged physical contact with Star-Lord. However, the four of them survived as all of them combined were strong enough to absorb and contain its power. As Ronan demanded how they were able to sustain its power given that they were mortal, Quill responded that they were the Guardians of the Galaxy before directing the Power Stone at Ronan, decimating him, before Gamora contained the stone in the Orb.

Gamora after the death of Ronan the Accuser
With Xandar now saved and the Orb protected once again, Yondu Udonta arrived with his clan and demanded that Quill give him the Orb as he had promised. Despite Gamora's pleads against it, Quill gave in and handed over the Orb. However, once the Ravagers had left the planet, Quill revealed to Gamora that he had switched them and still had the Infinity Stone. Gamora spoke to Quill and he explained how Udonta was the only family he had ever had, but she told him that that was no longer true.

Guardians of the Galaxy
Aftermath
Gamora and Quill speak to Nova Prime
The Power Stone was then given to the Nova Corps, with the Nova Prime Irani Rael personally ensuring that the group was pardoned from their criminal records. The Nova Prime expressed her gratitude for saving Xandar from Ronan the Accuser before she discussed that Star-Lord's father was of a mysterious species while confirming that his mother was from Earth. 

Gamora and Drax discuss Thanos
As they left the Nova Corps Headquarters, Gamora spoke to Drax the Destroyer about him having avenged his family by finally killing Ronan the Accuser. Drax, however, made it clear that Thanos was his next target, claiming that Ronan was a scapegoat and that Thanos was the mastermind behind the massacre. Before they departed Xandar, they were reminded that they could not commit any crimes, despite that their past criminal records were expunged.

Gamora and Peter Quill leave Xandar
Now free from Thanos and her deadly past, Gamora permanently joined Quill, Rocket, and Drax as the Guardians of the Galaxy. As they prepared to leave on the Milano, which had been rebuilt by Rhomann Dey, Gamora found Quill having finally opened a gift from his late mother, a new music mix. When Quill played one of the songs, Gamora danced to it. They then left the planet under Quill's leadership, intending to do good, some bad, and a bit of both.

Battle on Sovereign
Gamora prepares to fight the Abilisk
After the Battle of Xandar, the Guardians of the Galaxy became well known across the galaxy. The Sovereign hired the Guardians to take down the Abilisk that was eating the Anulax Batteries and terrorizing the citizens of Sovereign. The Guardians arrived on the Sovereign before the Abilisk's arrival, discussing their plan.

Gamora talks to Groot while fighting the Abilisk
Gamora questioned Drax as to why he wasn't wearing one of Rocket Raccoon's flight suits which he told her it made his nipples hurt, causing Rocket to laugh at his statement. As the Abilisk approached them, Gamora got out a rifle which Star-Lord questioned as her thing was swords. She responded that how unlikely it would be for her to fight and kill the creature with only her Godslayer. As they fought the Abilisk, Gamora told Groot, who was dancing, to move from danger and responded by waving.

Gamora prepares to kill the Abilisk
Drax then informed Gamora that the Abilisk must be cut on the inside so it could be fully destroyed. Gamora tried to warn him not to do so, but he ignored her warnings and jumped in its mouth as the Abilisk swallowed him. Star-Lord looked in horror as Drax was seemingly devoured by the creature, and then asked her what he was thinking. Gamora insisted Quill that she warned Drax, and he refused to listen to her warning.

The Guardians of the Galaxy finish their mission
Star-Lord then told Gamora to aim for the cut on its neck as he and Rocket Raccoon distracted it from above. As Gamora was about to fire, she ran out of ammo and took out her sword to finally kill it. While Star-Lord and Rocket continued shooting at it from above, Gamora cut through the Abilisk, finally killing it and ending its reign of terror against the citizens of Sovereign. After the battle, the Guardians got changed as Quill warned them about the Sovereign people.

Family Reunion
Gamora meets Ayesha
The three were brought before the Sovereign themselves in the capital city where they awaited their payment. The Guardians appeared before the priestess Ayesha, who expressed her gratitude in the Guardians stopping the Abilisk. As Ayesha explained how the Sovereign people were created, Star-Lord attempted to flirt with the High Priestess by attempting to inform her how humans reproduced. Ayesha expressed interest in Quill's proposal and claimed that he could give her a history lesson one day.

Gamora is reunited with Nebula
While Quill expressed that he would be honored to educate her, Gamora, annoyed with his suggestive and seductive remarks, interrupted their conversation and demanded their payment. Moments later, a masked prisoner was brought before them and unmasked by several guards. The prisoner turned out to be Nebula, whom Ayesha explained attempted to steal some Anulax Batteries as a reason for her apprehension.

The Guardians of the Galaxy take custody of Nebula
Gamora calmly exchanged glances at Nebula who looked at her in rage. As Ayesha claimed to understand that Nebula was her adopted sister, Gamora insisted that she was not worth any value to her more than the bounty that was due for her on Xandar for her past war crimes she committed under the commands of Thanos and Ronan the Accuser during the Quest for the Orb. As the Guardians left the palace, Ayesha then asked Quill about his lineage, suggesting that his father was of an unordinary species, before Gamora took Nebula and headed to the Milano as Rocket insulted the Sovereign people.

Gamora argues with Nebula
As the Guardians flew away from Sovereign, Gamora tied Nebula upright, as Star-Lord and Drax gossiped about her. While Gamora continued to fix her restraints, Nebula demanded to be given some Yaro Root, only for Gamora to deny her wishes and claim that it was unripe, before claiming that she hated Nebula. Questioning if she truly hated her, Nebula reminded Gamora that she was the one who betrayed Ronan and stole the Orb for herself, before threatening to kill her.

Gamora pilots the Milano
However, Gamora rebutted her threat and arrogantly insisted that she would spend the rest of her life in a Xandarian prison wishing she had the opportunity. As they continued to quarrel, the Milano was pursued and attacked by a fleet of Omnicrafts attacked them as Rocket stole some of their batteries. As they attempted to escape, Quill and Rocket began to argue which Gamora had to break up. Drax then fired at the fleet using a spacesuit, but as the Milano crashed, the cable Drax was attached to broke causing Gamora to hold onto it as the ship crashed into Berhert.

Encounter with Ego
Meeting Star-Lord's Father
The Guardians of the Galaxy fight with each other
After the six reunited despite the destruction of the Milano, an argument erupted on Berhert over who was to blame for the crash. As the fight continued, Nebula noticed an unidentified craft descending from the atmosphere, claiming that someone followed them through the jump point.

Gamora witnesses Peter Quill's father arrive
Nebula attempted to trick Gamora by demanding her to liberate her from her restraints so she could help the Guardians of the Galaxy fight the unknown threat. Gamora ignored her claims, stating that she was not stupid to believe her knowing that Nebula would seize the opportunity to kill her if she was freed. As Star-Lord sarcastically claimed that Nebula was an expert at lying, the ship landed in front of them, and the craft opened and the Ego and Mantis stepped out of the pod, with Ego revealing himself as Quill's biological father.

Gamora listens to Ego
That night, the Guardians of the Galaxy set up a campfire, and Ego proceeded to explain to them that he had been searching for Quill ever since Yondu Udonta and the Ravagers failed to uphold their end of the bargain having refused to turn him over to Ego. As Drax and Star-Lord disagreed on the notion of Yondu being his father, Gamora asked how Ego found them, to which he responded that he had heard rumors and stories designating Star-Lord as a hero for his involvement in saving Xandar from Ronan the Accuser. Ego then offered the Guardians of the Galaxy a chance to explore his planet, and from there he would explain Quill's true heritage.  

Gamora, Star-Lord, and Drax depart to Ego's Planet
While Ego used the bathroom, Gamora persuaded Quill to go with Ego to 'Ego's Planet when Quill expressed his skepticism of his father's claims. Instead, Gamora assured him that they could just kill Ego if he turned out to be evil. The next day, Gamora, Drax, and Star-Lord departed Berhert, leaving Rocket, Groot, and Nebula. Before they left, Nebula asked Gamora if she was leaving her with Rocket Raccoon, mistaking his species for a fox. Gamora corrected her statement about Rocket's species and instructed him to shoot her if she tried to escape.

Exploring Ego's Planet
Gamora refuses to let Mantis touch her
Gamora and Drax accompanied Peter Quill aboard Ego's Ship leaving Nebula with Rocket Raccoon and Groot who had remained to repair the Milano. Once onboard, Drax conversed with Mantis, asking about her antennas, to which she responded that she had the ability to experience a person's emotions. She displayed her abilities as an empath by touching Quill and revealing his crush on Gamora, as she looked at him in surprise. She was startled by this revelation and refused to let Mantis touch her threatening her with a broken jaw if she tried to do so.

Gamora explores Ego's planet
The Guardians ultimately arrived on Ego's homeworld. Gamora observed the sublime landscapes and diverse fauna on the planet in fascination. Perplexed, Gamora asked what species Ego was, and was startled by the revelation that Ego was in fact, a Celestial, which affirmed Star-Lord's lineage as a Celestial as well. Ego continued to elaborate on how he came into existence, explaining how he created his planet.
