Colonel James Rupert "Rhodey" Rhodes is an officer with the United States Air Force and liaison between the military in the Department of Acquisitions and Stark Industries, where he became close friends with Tony Stark. When Stark had been kidnapped by the Ten Rings, Rhodes personally led a mission to rescue his best friend. However, upon their return, Rhodes saw Stark moving away from developing his weapons for the military and soon discovered that he was instead focusing on becoming a hero known as Iron Man. Despite all of his fears for his friend's safety, Rhodes still joined Iron Man in bringing down Obadiah Stane's schemes, while trying to keep Stark's secrets, only for Stark to reveal them to the media himself.

With Iron Man's identity known, Rhodes found himself under pressure from the United States Congress and the military to take possession of the armor for himself, something that he was against. However, as Stark's reckless behavior got even worse, Rhodes had no choice but to take the Mark II before handing it over to the military, with Justin Hammer upgrading it with his new weapons to rebrand Rhodes as War Machine. However, just when War Machine was being presented to the world, Ivan Vanko returned and attacked the Stark Expo with an army of Hammer Drones, as War Machine teamed up with Iron Man to bring him down, resulting in Rhodes keeping the armor for himself, despite Stark's continued objections.

In response to the Chitauri Invasion, Rhodes took on the identity of the Iron Patriot and worked directly for President Matthew Ellis. When a terrorist named the Mandarin was claiming responsibility for a string of domestic terrorist attacks, Rhodes was dispatched to hunt him down. However, Rhodes had soon discovered that the Mandarin was in fact a ruse created by Aldrich Killian by hiring actor Trevor Slattery to portray the role, as Killian managed to capture Rhodes and steal the Iron Patriot Armor, as Killian's henchman, Eric Savin, then used it to kidnap President Ellis as part of his ongoing Mandarin ruse. Rhodes managed to free himself and teamed up with Stark to defeat Killian's army of Extremis Soldiers and save President Ellis before Killian could publicly execute him, as Rhodes also uncovered Vice President Rodriguez's role in Killian's plan.

Reverting back to the War Machine name, Rhodes continued serving his country and assisted the Avengers in the Battle of Sokovia, playing a key role in ensuring that as many Sokovians were evacuated before Ultron could cause mass extinction. Following the battle, Rhodes became an official member of the Avengers. However, Rhodes soon found himself in conflict with the team as the debate over the Sokovia Accords led to Captain America and Iron Man disagreeing and War Machine choosing to side with the government in support of the Accords. As the conflict worsened, War Machine clashed with Captain America's allies while they tried to protect the Winter Soldier and expose the plans of Helmut Zemo, only for War Machine to be disabled as he had been inadvertently shot out of the sky by Vision.

Having been given leg braces by Tony Stark to help him walk again, Rhodes had became disillusioned by the government and decided to disobey Thaddeus Ross' orders and instead assisted Steve Rogers as they had learned of the impending invasion of the Mad Titan, Thanos and his Black Order. Once they traveled to Wakanda in order to protect the Mind Stone from Thanos, War Machine fought alongside his allies in their attempts to hold back the Black Order and their own army of Outriders. However, as Thanos arrived himself, War Machine and the others were unable to defeat him as Thanos took the Mind Stone and caused the Snap, as War Machine had then watched on helplessly while trillions of lives were erased.

Determined to undo Thanos' actions, War Machine joined the Avengers to the Garden, as they discovered that Thanos had destroyed the Infinity Stones, prompting Thor to behead the Mad Titan. However, by 2023, the Avengers learned to travel through time and initiated a Time Heist, where War Machine joined Nebula on a mission to obtain the Power Stone from Morag in 2014. Succeeding in the mission, the Avengers resurrected the victims of the Snap, before then being attacked by a past version of Thanos and his entire armies of the Chitauri and Outriders. War Machine then joined his fellow heroes in battling Thanos until Stark sacrificed his life to finally eliminate Thanos, as Rhodes stayed by his best friend's side during his final moments before attending his funeral.

Biography
Early Life
Work at Stark Industries
James Rhodes met Tony Stark at MIT, where the two of them became best friends, with a close bond and rivalry that would last their entire lives. In the spring of 1987, according to Stark, Rhodes allegedly guessed wrong when sleeping with someone who Stark insinuated was actually a transvestite named Ivan. When he grew older, Rhodes joined the United States Air Force, and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Due to his continued friendship with Stark, he also became the liaison between Stark Industries and their Armed Forces.

On January 30, 2009, Rhodes witnessed Stark present his newest weapon at the Yuma Proving Ground for a group of military generals. Afterwards while Rhodes attempted to convince Stark not to go to Afghanistan for the Jericho demonstration, they took his private jet to a nightclub. There, Stark got himself and Rhodes a double date with Eloise and Celeste, whom he told about his and Rhodes' argument. When Stark was attacked by a man whose girlfriend he had seduced, Rhodes intervened and fought off the attacker to protect his friend. Stark and the girls then persuaded Rhodes to join them at Stark's Mansion to continue their party.

Dispute with Tony Stark
Presenting Tony Stark's Award
Rhodes presenting an award to Tony Stark
Rhodes was invited to attend an award ceremony at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas in order to present Tony Stark with an award for all of his work. As Rhodes stood on the stage, he told the audience that he felt that it was an honor to be the liaison between Stark Industries and the United States Armed Forces, calling Stark a true patriot and a close friend.

Rhodes gives Obadiah Stane Stark's award
However, as it turned out, Stark was not in attendance as he did not come to the stage when Rhodes called him. As the entire audience applauded for Stark, Obadiah Stane had instead accepted the award from Rhodes in Stark's honor. While Rhodes stood to the back of the room, he listened while Stane claimed that the reason Stark was not at the ceremony to collect the award in person would be because he was still working, which Rhodes knew would be highly unlikely.

Rhodes and Tony Stark at a Las Vegas casino
Heading back in Las Vegas, Rhodes had eventually found his friend while he was still partying in one of the casinos and scolded him for not attending their award ceremony, although Stark just denied any knowledge that Rhodes was the one who would present the award, sarcastically claiming that he was deeply honored that Rhodes had done it. He continued to show little sign of taking anything seriously as he continued to joke, gamble and flirt with the beautiful women around him, even teasing Rhodes by asking him to blow on his dice; before long, Stark had lost his bet for ten million dollars and decided that it was time to go home, much to the great relief of Rhodes.

Rhodes tells Tony Stark to not arrive late again
As they exited the casino with Happy Hogan and Stark's entire team of personal bodyguards, Stark shook hands with Rhodes while they then agreed upon the time to meet to leave for Afghanistan onboard the Stark Industries Private Jet, while Rhodes had insisted that Stark could not turn up late. Once Rhodes had left, Stark then handed over the award to a member of the casino's staff before leaving to return back to Malibu with Hogan and the rest of his entourage.

Private Plane Ride
Rhodes waits for Tony Stark beside the plane
The next day, Tony Stark had indeed arrived late to his meeting with Rhodes at the Stark Industries Aviation Division, due to spending the night with Christine Everhart. Rhodes attempted to chastise his friend but was simply ignored as Stark claimed that he was caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair while Happy Hogan loaded his bags. Although Rhodes had continued to try and chastise Stark, he was told that he was now the one holding up the plane.

Rhodes confronts Tony Stark over his attitude
During the flight on Afghanistan onboard the Stark Industries Private Jet, Rhodes talked with Stark and made it clear that he was unhappy about Stark's lax attitude, and Stark tried to get his friend to relax. Rhodes, however, insisted that Stark viewed him as nothing more than his babysitter, to which Stark then responded by requesting that the stewardesses bring them some drinks, although Rhodes insisted that they should not be drinking but should focus on their work.

Rhodes getting drunk along with Tony Stark
Although Rhodes insisted he would not be drinking as he had work to do, Stark eventually won him over as they began drinking together. Before long, Rhodes and Stark were drunk as Rhodes ranted about his experiences being with the United States Air Force, while Stark was distracted by leering at the three stewardesses who were dancing provocatively around a stripper pole to club music. While Stark had left with one stewardess, Rhodes was left with the other two who seduced him.

Rhodes suffering from his serious hangover
By the next morning, Rhodes had awoken with a serious hangover as even the sound of Stark happily eating all his breakfast hurt Rhodes' head, as Stark showed no sign of a hangover. Just as Rhodes got to his feet and prepared to get into bed in order to get some rest before they arrived, the stewardess returned as she informed them that they were just about to land in Afghanistan and had then advised them to take their seats, much to the considerable annoyance of Rhodes.

Tony Stark's Kidnapping
Weapons Presentation
Rhodes stepping out of Tony Stark's plane
Once the Stark Industries Private Jet had landed, Rhodes and Tony Stark had arrived at a military outpost in Afghanistan to demonstrate the Jericho. While Stark had gotten out of their plane first and happily greeted all of their military leaders, including Major General William Gabriel, Rhodes took a little longer to get out of their plane due to his hangover, which Stark had still continued to mock.

Rhodes during their Jericho demonstration
As their presentation went ahead, Rhodes stood beside Gabriel and the other United States Armed Forces leaders as they watched Stark give his speech about the Jericho, the new super-missile system with terrifying destructive capabilities designed by Stark Industries. As the missile was demonstrated, the shockwave from the blast knocked everyone backwards and had the desired effect as Gabriel and all of the others agreed to buy the weapons from Stark and Rhodes.

Rhodes compliments Tony Stark on his work
Following the successful demonstration, Rhodes greeted Stark while he was speaking to Obadiah Stane and congratulated him. Stark had then gone off with the Humvee convoy, before jokingly telling Rhodes to wait for the next one. However, Stark's Humvee was then attacked by the Ten Rings and Stark had disappeared without a trace. Rhodes took command over the rescue mission to locate his friend, although they were unable to find Stark in the mountains and deserts.

Rescuing Tony Stark
Rhodes and William Gabriel discussing Stark
Following the disappearance of Tony Stark, Rhodes then personally led missions to try and find him, with no avail. Having returned to the United States of America, Rhodes decided that he would return to Afghanistan in order to continue the search, regardless of how hopeless it seemed. Just as Rhodes prepared to board the plane, Major General William Gabriel requested private word with Rhodes.

Rhodes is given permission to find Tony Stark
Clearly unsure of Rhodes' plan to continue searching for Stark in the desert, Gabriel noted how unlikely it was that they would be able to find the Ten Rings' hideout. Seeing Rhodes' determination, Gabriel noted how the other soldiers in the United States Air Force would do anything for the career that Rhodes was currently risking by going on this futile search mission, however, he still approved Rhodes' right to go and wished him good luck as Rhodes had saluted Gabriel.

Rhodes rescues Tony Stark from the desert
Upon returning to Afghanistan, Rhodes led a military unit as they flew across the desert, searching for any indication that Stark was still alive. During their search, they suddenly found Stark, walking alone through the desert, having escaped from Raza's base. Landing the helicopter, Rhodes ran to his friend and teased him about his choice in Humvee, before they embraced on another, with Rhodes amazed that they had actually been able to find Stark alive in the desert.

Tony Stark's New Direction
Rhodes personally bringing Tony Stark home
Having rescued him from the Ten Rings, Rhodes had then personally brought Tony Stark back home from Afghanistan to the United States of America, as Rhodes helped Stark walk off the plane by holding his hand. Once they had arrived at the Edwards Air Force Base, Stark had then told Rhodes to get rid of all medical assistance that was waiting for him and then told Pepper Potts to call a press conference for him immediately.

Rhodes and Pepper Potts listen to Tony Stark
Once they arrived back at the Stark Industries Headquarters, Rhodes watched on as Stark had appeared before the group of reporters and cameramen alongside Obadiah Stane. Rhodes watched the speech alongside Pepper Potts and listened as Stark asked everyone to sit down on the floor, which Rhodes compared to the hippy movement. Rhodes watched with Potts as Stark then discussed his relationship with Howard Stark and how he wished he could speak with his father about the legacy of Stark Industries in the wake of seeing how all his weapons were used by the Ten Rings against American soldiers.

Rhodes learns of Tony Stark's change of plan
As the speech went on, Stark was asked about what had happened to him during his time in the Ten Rings Base, to which Stark claimed that he had had his eyes opened. With that, Stark then informed the reporters how he intended to shut down Stark Industries' weapons manufacturing division immediately, much to their surprise and the horror of Rhodes, Potts, and Stane, as Rhodes bowed his head while Stane desperately tried to calm the situation and removed Stark.

Visited by Tony Stark
Rhodes speaks to a team of Air Force recruits
While back at the Edwards Air Force Base, Rhodes was giving a talk to some United States Air Force recruits about the value of manned fighter jets such as the F-22 Raptor, during which Rhodes had also insisted that no unmanned vehicle would ever trump a pilot's instincts during a combat situation. The talk was interrupted by the arrival of Tony Stark who had personally greeted all of the recruits.

Rhodes is teased by Tony Stark by his recruits
While Stark briefly teased Rhodes by hinting at a humiliating story involving a transvestite in the spring of 1987, which made Ronald Coultrap and Ralph Vats laugh. Once Rhodes had dismissed the recruits, he spoke with Stark who had claimed that he was working on a big new project, which initially delighted Rhodes initially was delighted as he believed this meant that Stark Industries had decided to reopen its work with the military following Stark's recent press conference.

Rhodes learns of Tony Stark's change of plan
However, Stark revealed that this was a private project which he did not intend to involve the United States Armed Forces with. Frustrated upon hearing all this, Rhodes had then made it clear that he did not agree with what Stark was currently doing and he thought Stark was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder because of his capture by the Ten Rings and needed time to recover so that he could return to building weapons for the military as he had done previously.

Creation of Iron Man
Rhodes seeing Iron Man for the first time
In Gulmira, Afghanistan, terrorists from the Ten Rings were rounding up civilians for capture and execution when they were confronted by a mysterious figure in red and gold armor. Within seconds, Iron Man had easily defeated all of the terrorists and destroyed all the weapons they had obtained, resulting in Rhodes being called in to investigate the situation.

Rhodes follows Iron Man's ongoing actions
While Iron Man left the area, Rhodes questioned how it was possible that Iron Man had just shown up in Afghanistan without ever being spotted on their radar, being informed that it was not stealth but did appear to be tiny. While Allen had questioned what they were dealing with, Rhodes decided to make a call to Tony Stark, believing that he could be the one responsible for whatever this thing was since it was targeting the terrorists who kidnapped him a few months earlier.

Rhodes questions Tony Stark about Iron Man
As Stark had made excuses about where he was, Rhodes informed him of their ongoing situation and questioned whether or not he had any Stark Industries technology in the area that could be responsible, which Stark denied. During their conversation, F-22 Raptors spotted Iron Man as Rhodes informed Stark that they intended to destroy the weapon. Rhodes communicated with the pilots as they attempted to destroy the weapon, unable to determine exactly what it was.

Rhodes watches Iron Man escaping their jets
Iron Man tried to outrun the jets, going supersonic before one of the jets fired his missile at him, which Iron Man destroyed by deploying flairs. Rhodes and Allen continued watching all this from Edwards Air Force Base before Iron Man suddenly disappeared from their radar. While they tried to understand what happened, Stark called Rhodes again and confessed that he was indeed the one responsible for the unidentified craft they were chasing, which had enraged Rhodes.

Rhodes discovers that Tony Stark is Iron Man
Just as Rhodes was furiously confronting Stark for sending in more of his unauthorized equipment in US airspace, he became horrified when Stark explained that the equipment was a suit of armor which he was wearing. At this moment, Iron Man was spotted under one of the jets, resulting in them shaking him off and Iron Man inadvertently destroying one of the wings. Despite the pilot being in grave danger, Rhodes watched as Iron Man came to his rescue just in time.

Rhodes questions Tony Stark over his actions
Although the second pilot got a visual on Iron Man and questioned if he should reengage with the target, Rhodes suggested that because they did not know exactly what this was, they should hold back on destroying it, choosing to keep it secret that Stark was the one who was actually inside the armor. However, Allen insisted that Iron Man should be destroyed for taking down an Air Force jet in a legal no-fly zone, ordering the pilot to shoot when he got a clear shot.

Rhodes denies the involvement of Iron Man
Fortunately, Iron Man was able to get away from the second jet and escaped, as Stark called Rhodes, who insisted that Stark now owed the Air Force a new plane to replace the one he destroyed. Although Stark invited Rhodes to his Mansion in Malibu to see his new project, Rhodes questioned what he should tell the press about this. Rhodes then took Stark's advice and held his press conference, claiming that the incident was due to an accident during a training exercise.

Obadiah Stane's Betrayal
Rhodes learning of Obadiah Stane's betrayal
Rhodes was later called up by Pepper Potts, who informed him that she had discovered Obadiah Stane had in fact been the one responsible for Tony Stark being kidnapped by the Ten Rings. Although Rhodes was highly skeptical that Stane would do something like this to Stark, he did as Potts requested and drove down to Stark's Mansion in order to ensure that Stane had not tried to kill Stark.

Rhodes finding the unconscious Tony Stark
As he arrived, Rhodes called out to Stark but got no response, much to his worry. Rhodes proceeded to head downstairs into Stark's basement where he found him lying unconscious on the floor. As Rhodes ran to his friend's aid, he discovered that Stark had saved himself just in time by replacing the Arc Reactor that Stane had just stolen from his chest in order to power his Iron Monger Armor. As Stark awoke, he questioned where Potts was, but Rhodes assured him that things were under control.

Rhodes helps Tony Stark suit up in his armor
However, when Rhodes explained that Potts had teamed up with Phil Coulson and sent a dozen S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to arrest Stane, Stark still insisted that this would not be enough to stop Stane as soon as he was able to power the Iron Monger armor by using Stark's Arc Reactor. With little time left, Rhodes then helped Stark get back onto his feet as they prepared to join the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to fight back against Stane as soon as possible, with Stark knowing that he would have to use his own Mark III armor to combat the Iron Monger. As Rhodes then watched Stark suit up, he was completely awestruck at the Mark III, saying that it was the coolest thing he had ever seen.

Rhodes vowing to one day wear the Mark II
When Rhodes asked if he needed him to do anything else to assist him, Stark asked for his assistance in keeping the United States Air Force out of the way while he confronted Iron Monger. As Iron Man flew away in order to protect Potts from Iron Monger, Rhodes looked at the prototype Mark II Stark built earlier and considered taking it, then shook his head and mumbled that he intended to wear it next time before leaving the mansion to do as Stark had requested.

Rhodes keeps the Air Force from interfering
Acting on Stark's orders, Rhodes had soon returned to the Edwards Air Force Base where they were just realizing that Iron Man had just returned and was preparing to take military action against him as he fought Iron Monger over Los Angeles. Rhodes arrived just in time and was able to prevent the military from getting involved with Iron Man's fight with Iron Monger by passing it off as a routine training exercise, which all of the soldiers accepted without any questions.

Iron Man's Speech
Rhodes during Tony Stark's press conference
Following Iron Monger's death, Rhodes and Tony Stark were taken to a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. base and met with Phil Coulson, who promised to give Stark training with their agents. Rhodes later held a press conference about the incident with the two armored individuals and had tried to pass it off by claiming that Iron Man was Stark's bodyguard. Rhodes had then invited Stark to the stage to go into his detail about the events.

Rhodes tries to give Tony Stark some advice
When Stark had seemed to ramble upon being questioned for more details by Christine Everhart, Rhodes simply reminded him to stick to the cards he had been given which gave a clear narrative about the incident between him and Obadiah Stane, without revealing the truth. Instead, Stark had taken just a brief moment to consider what those consequences might be for him before he finally exposed himself as Iron Man to the world's media, much to Rhodes' great dismay.

Questioning Iron Man
Meeting with Congress
Rhodes reunites with Tony Stark at Congress
Rhodes was brought into a debate over whether Iron Man should be allowed to stay in Tony Stark's hands when Senator Stern expressed doubts. Stern also then introduced Rhodes to General Thaddeus Ross with the plan to replace Stark with their new weapon, the Aerodynamic Marvel. Six months after Stark told the world he was Iron Man, Rhodes was asked to write his report analyzing Iron Man.

Rhodes giving his own statement to Congress
Upon arriving at the United States Congress during their debate over Stark's status as Iron Man, with Stern still wanting the Iron Man Armor to be handed over to the Armed Forces, Rhodes was instructed to read out some specific sections of his analysis of Iron Man. Despite expressing his reluctance to read sections out of context, Rhodes did as requested and read a section where he had claimed that in Stark's hands, Iron Man could present a threat to the United States.

Rhodes seeing Tony Stark get the upper hand
Although Rhodes tried to defend his statements by claiming that the rest of his analysis stated that the benefits of Iron Man outweighed the risks, Stern continued to try and dismiss the claims. As they debated, Sterns ordered Rhodes to reveal footage of countries such as North Korea and Iran where it had appeared that they were attempting to recreate Stark's Arc Reactor technology to reproduce their own versions of the Iron Man weaponry for their military.

Rhodes and Tony Stark conclude the debate
Unsure about this, Stark proceeded to use his mobile phone to hack into the screens and show clearer footage of these tests, proving that the technology was not close to being ready. Rhodes attempted to remain professional, yet couldn't help chuckling when some of the footage showed Justin Hammer attempting to create a Hammer Industries suit, only for it to malfunction. Stark then concluded that Iron Man was safest in his hands since he had "privatized" world peace, much to Rhodes' amusement.

Plane Ride Home
Rhodes being told to apologize by Tony Stark
Following the meeting with the United States Congress, Rhodes had joined Tony Stark and Pepper Potts as they then boarded the Stark Industries Private Jet and discussed what happened in the hearing. During their flight, Stark had demanded that Rhodes apologize for ambushing him with his report, although Rhodes insisted that he had indeed given Stark the report two months prior, which Potts confirmed, while Stark ranted about being Iron Man and how that was his main priority.

Rhodes becomes more annoyed at Tony Stark
As their argument went on, Rhodes revealed that he would not be joining the pair when they went to Monaco and had even admitted that he was beginning to feel that hanging out with Stark was damaging their friendship, which greatly offended Stark. Rhodes then awkwardly listened while Stark and Potts discussed what to do for his upcoming birthday, with Stark insisting that he did not like any of Potts' ideas for a relaxing day instead of a party.

Helping Tony Stark
Rhodes demanding to speak with Tony Stark
Following an incident in Monaco where Tony Stark was attacked by a terrorist known as Whiplash who used his own Arc Reactor to create a weaponized suit, Rhodes was forced into making calls to the government to keep the peace. Rhodes went to Stark's Mansion intending to confront Stark, demanding Pepper Potts or Natalie Rushman tell him where Stark was, and learned that he was downstairs.

Rhodes berating Tony Stark over the situation
Going downstairs into Stark's basement, Rhodes found him sitting in his car while getting his briefing from J.A.R.V.I.S. about the history of both Ivan Vanko and Anton Vanko, his father. Once Stark turned off the briefing, Rhodes had immediately begun berating him about what happened, demanding that Stark handle the situation, noting how the National Guard aimed to confiscate Stark's Iron Man armors in response to Whiplash's recent public attack against him.

However, as Rhodes continued scolding him, he found that Stark was almost completely unable to look him in the eyes. When Rhodes then questioned how he was feeling, Stark tried to get out of his car but was barely able to stand, collapsing into Rhodes' arms due to poisoning from his own Arc Reactor. Rhodes then helped Stark get to his desk where he proceeded to remove the Arc Reactor from his chest and replace the Palladium inside it, which Rhodes had discovered, to his horror, was now burning out inside Stark's chest. Rhodes also saw that Stark had markings on his neck from the poisoning, which Stark simply dismissed as simply road rash.

Rhodes tries to offer Tony Stark some advice
Once Stark had then reactivated his next Arc Reactor and began to breathe normally again, a concerned Rhodes insisted that Stark's attempts to live his life as a lone gunslinger were unnecessary since he could go to him for some help with his missions as Iron Man. Stark, however, insisted that this was not the case, claiming that despite what everybody was saying, he knew exactly what he was doing. Rhodes told Stark about Whiplash, who had seemingly died in a prison explosion.

Rhodes gets frustrated at Tony Stark's attitude
Stark insisted that Whiplash was no longer a threat since his technology was destroyed and he was now dead. However, Rhodes noted that their fight on the tracks had been too close as Stark was almost killed. Taking a deep breath, Stark then asked Rhodes what he should do, to which Rhodes urged him to head back upstairs and convince the world's media that Iron Man was back and ready to be a team player, which Stark agreed to.

Rhodes watches Tony Stark's latest outburst
Rhodes and Stark greeted Potts and Rushman, who were still trying to sort out the situation. However, rather than focus on dealing with the fallout of Whiplash's attack, Stark instead continued planning his birthday party. Rhodes became annoyed by Stark's attitude, while reminding him of the conversation they had just had. Continuing his irresponsible behavior, Stark went on his balcony and had yelled to the news helicopters that everything was fine, much to Rhodes' frustration.

Tony Stark's Birthday Party

Later, Rhodes arrived for Tony Stark's birthday party, hoping that he would still be able to convince Stark to begin taking their current situation following Whiplash's attack seriously. As he pulled up outside Stark's Mansion, Rhodes was still on the phone to his superiors, promising that within twenty-four hours, he would have ensured that Iron Man was back under their watch.

Rhodes and Pepper Potts attend Stark's party
When Rhodes arrived, he was ushered inside by the nervous Pepper Potts and immediately asked to do something as Stark was now wearing his Mark IV Armor in order to get drunk and show off, which had resulted in him being able to barely stand due to all the alcohol he had consumed. Upon seeing this embarrassing display from Iron Man, Rhodes furiously wanted to stop Stark before somebody got hurt, noting how he had just put his career with the Air Force on the line for him. He then watched on as Potts tried to calm the situation and end the party, only for Stark to insist that nobody stop drinking, claiming that the after-party was just beginning.

Rhodes witnesses Tony Stark losing all control
Rhodes then watched on with considerable annoyance as Iron Man had begun to put all of his party guests at serious risk by firing his repulsors at several random objects, like champagne bottles and a watermelon, that were being thrown in the air. Seeing how incredibly irresponsible and foolish Stark was behaving with his technology, Rhodes had decided that Stern was right and enough was enough, as it was time for him to put an end to Stark's antics.

Rhodes returns wearing the Mark II armor
Having become outraged over the situation, Rhodes stormed off from the main party and headed downstairs into Stark's basement. Once he was alone, Rhodes then put on the Mark II Armor and proceeded to return to Stark's party. He then furiously demanded that all of the guests immediately leave the premises, insisting that he would only say this once. The guests then ran away as fast as possible while Rhodes had personally confronted Stark.

Rhodes attempts to subdue Iron Man himself
Despite Rhodes' stern warnings, Iron Man had shown little regard for the threats and turned to Adam Goldstein, requesting that he put on a good piece of music for their incoming fight. As Goldstein had played Queen, Rhodes tackled Iron Man and demanded that he shut down the Mark IV armor, only for Iron Man to respond by launching himself and Rhodes backward and through a wall into the gym. Iron Man told Rhodes to put the Mark II back where he found it.

Rhodes and Iron Man fight within the Mansion
However, Rhodes had refused to give up and responded by throwing the weights at Iron Man's helmet. Annoyed by this, Iron Man instead grabbed another nearby weight and proceeded to strike Rhodes with full force, which knocked him backward through the boxing ring as the two best friends began fighting. When Iron Man claimed Rhodes could not be his sidekick, Rhodes grabbed a weight and struck him multiple times before then throwing him through the ceiling.

Rhodes and Iron Man brawling in the kitchen
As their fight escalated, Rhodes had soon mastered how to use the armor and flew up to where Iron Man was lying, questioning if he had enough. However, their fight still continued as Iron Man and Rhodes fell through another ceiling, almost hitting Potts and Natalie Rushman before Happy Hogan ran in to protect them. The pair then brawled all through the kitchen in front of their horrified guests, until Iron Man had smashed Rhodes through the kitchen counter.

Rhodes finally demands that Iron Man give up
While Iron Man bellowed at the guests, causing them to flee in terror, Rhodes had recovered and proceeded to rip out part of the kitchen counter and smashed Iron Man across the face with it, knocking him into the fireplace. Once Iron Man had recovered, the two friends both raised their arms and threatened to shoot the other with the repulsor beams, while Rhodes continued to demand that Iron Man put his hand down and finally surrender in order to end their conflict.

Rhodes and Iron Man shooting at each other
However, Iron Man had still continued to question whether or not Rhodes really had what it took to wear the Mark II armor. Despite Rhodes demanding that Iron Man put his hand down, he had still continued to antagonize Rhodes, calling him the War Machine and telling him to take his shot. Eventually, they fired their repulsors at each other, causing a massive shockwave which knocked them both back and also destroyed a large part of Stark's Mansion.

Rhodes takes the Mark II armor for the military
Rhodes was the first to recover from the shockwave blast and had decided that, due to all of Stark's recent behavior where he had proved himself to be dangerous, he could not allow his friend to be the only one with an Iron Man suit. Stark awoke shortly after Rhodes and, as he was still unable to stand, he was forced to watch on as Rhodes flew away with the Mark II Armor, intending to hand it over to their Armed Forces and use it for all the military's purposes.

War Machine
Return to the Military
Rhodes arrives back at the military air base
Having won his brawl against Iron Man, Rhodes proceeded to fly back to Edwards Air Force Base in order to drop off the Mark II to the military, warning them about his approach. Rhodes flew the Mark II at full speed into the base and then landed safely onto the runway, while more soldiers surrounded him in order to get a better look at the Iron Man armor, utterly amazed by what they were seeing.

Rhodes shows off the Mark II Armor to Allen
Once he had landed, Rhodes was greeted by Major Allen as well as dozens of other soldiers who all seemed awed by the sight of the armor. Once all of the United States Armed Forces soldiers had their own moment to admire the armor, Rhodes suggested that they take it inside in order to begin getting him out so that they could begin to weaponize the suit for the military's purposes. Allen then cleared the area so that they could bring Rhodes back into the base.

Rhodes insists he take command of the armor
Standing in front of his superiors, Rhodes stated that he was willing to allow the suit to be used by the military as long as he was the sole pilot of it, noting that besides Stark, he was the only one who knew how to operate the armor. Rhodes had discussed with Allen how they would weaponize the armor, as it was still at this time a limited prototype. He warned that the suit would have defense systems, as a man was electrocuted behind him and thrown backwards trying to get Rhodes out of the armor.

Rhodes showing the Mark II armor to Meade
Once the Mark II had been removed, Rhodes showed it to Major General Meade, who expressed his amazement and questioned if the armor was functional, which Rhodes confirmed. Meade insisted that he have Justin Hammer come to the base to weaponize the armor, explaining that Hammer Industries would be holding a demonstration at the Stark Expo and they wanted the War Machine Armor to introduce it, despite Rhodes' protests at the concept.

Becoming War Machine
Rhodes takes the Arc Reactor from the armor
As per Major General Meade's orders, Justin Hammer was brought in to the Edwards Air Force Base in order to upgrade the Mark II so that it was fully weaponized for their purposes. Before Hammer arrived, Rhodes had removed the Arc Reactor from the armor, not wanting Hammer to copy the design. Allen asked him questions, but Rhodes insisted that they just focus on arming the armor.

Rhodes has his meeting with Justin Hammer
Once Hammer had arrived, he expressed great enthusiasm at having the opportunity to weaponize the Mark II, while questioning if it was his birthday considering the gift that Rhodes had given him. Rhodes got straight to the point and asked what Hammer would be able to do for them, to which Hammer promised to upgrade their software. After Rhodes made it clear he wanted to know what weapons Hammer would provide, Hammer claimed they came to the right person.

Rhodes looks over Justin Hammer's weapons
Rhodes and Allen then watched on and listened while Hammer went through all the weaponry that Hammer Industries would be willing to provide to the Mark II. As Hammer showed them increasingly more powerful weapons, Rhodes and Allen continued to remain stoic, which confused Hammer as he provided larger weapons, including a grenade launcher and mini-gun. Finally, Hammer unveiled the Ex-Wife Missile, which he promised was his most powerful weapon. With the presentation over, Hammer noted that he had been unable to tell what Rhodes and Allen wanted since they neither of them had given him any reactions what-so-ever throughout his presentation.

Rhodes gives Justin Hammer his instructions
Finally, Rhodes spoke up and confirmed that he would take it, and as Hammer questioned which gun, in particular, he was referring to, Rhodes made it clear that he wanted to take every weapon shown to him, much to Hammer's surprise. Following Rhodes' instructions, Hammer had then upgraded the Mark II armor, before transforming it into the War Machine Armor that would be shown with the Hammer Drones during the upcoming Stark Expo in just a few days' time.

Battle at Stark Expo
Rhodes being unveiled as the War Machine
During Justin Hammer's display of his Hammer Drones at their Stark Expo, Rhodes had been unveiled to the entire world while wearing a brand new, advanced War Machine Armor. Moments before Rhodes was shown to the world, Hammer had explained that while his Drones were designed to save lives in the United States Armed Forces, he felt that there should always be a human in command of these robotic soldiers, which was why War Machine was created.

War Machine is reunited back with Iron Man
However, Hammer's speech was interrupted by Iron Man's arrival as he landed beside War Machine, eliciting a huge cheer from the entire audience. Iron Man immediately informed War Machine that they had trouble, waving to the audience in order not to cause panic, before explaining that he had learned Hammer was working with Ivan Vanko, and had faked Vanko's death in the prison and used him to build the Drones, which would be used against them.

War Machine being forced to target Iron Man
While Iron Man attempted to confront Hammer over all his work with Vanko, War Machine realized that all his systems were being hacked into. With him unable to control the Mark I anymore, Vanko was then able to take over control of all of the drones and the armor, before attempting to use them to destroy Iron Man as he aimed War Machine's mini-gun at him and had begun furiously firing. War Machine urged Iron Man to escape as he then flew up into the air.

War Machine being forced to chase Iron Man
War Machine and the Hammer Drones immediately began firing at Iron Man, showering the audience with broken glass, before all their flight systems were enabled by Vanko and they were launched into the air, despite the protests of War Machine inside the armor. While Iron Man continued trying to make J.A.R.V.I.S. hack into War Machine's armor to free him of Vanko's control, War Machine was still able to communicate with Stark and warn him of the incoming attacks. 

War Machine continues shooting at Iron Man
As they flew over the Stark Expo, War Machine was unable to stop Vanko from using his weapon systems to continue firing at Iron Man, causing mass destruction throughout their Expo. While War Machine and the Air Force drones chased Iron Man through the air, the Marine Corps drones fired from the ground, while dropping mortars onto the terrified civilians. During the chaos, Iron Man saved Peter Parker and several others while War Machine had continued attacking him.
