<html><p>Unconvinced, Fisk then showed Donovan their footage of Murdock fighting his way through Ryker's Island with the same amount of skill as Daredevil. Clearly confused by all the footage there, Donovan attempted to reassure Fisk that Donovan and Partners had already researched Murdock and had found through his medical records that he had lost his sight at the age of nine. Fisk, however, then noted that a man capable of this could have survived and recalled how Murdock threatened to stop Vanessa Marianna from reuniting with Fisk, while Fisk had stepped up to the nervous Donovan while saying this.

Fisk gives the FBI the name of Matt Murdock
They were then interrupted by the arrival of both Ray Nadeem as well as Benjamin Poindexter, as they prepared to finalize Fisk's deal with them. Fisk sat quietly while Donovan demanded everything that had been agreed upon, including Fisk's personal items, which Nadeem had agreed to supply as they had previously agreed if Fisk continued supplying valuable information about the Albanian Syndicate as well as others. Fisk then spoke up, and acknowledged the sacrifices the FBI had made, before claiming that Murdock was a criminal working for him, hoping that the FBI would soon arrest or kill Murdock.

Researching Benjamin Poindexter
Fisk gets all his files from Benjamin Donovan
Wanting to understand Benjamin Poindexter better, Fisk then had both Benjamin Donovan and Felix Manning pull together every file they could find on Poindexter's youth, therapy, military records, and past employment, as Donovan personally delivered it to Fisk. As he looked over all the paperwork and therapy recordings, Donovan confirmed that this was everything that Manning had been able to pull together as Fisk noted that this would take some time, as Donovan took a seat with an audiobook while Fisk got to work reading everything there was about Poindexter.

Fisk learns about Benjamin Poindexter's youth
Fisk first learned that the young Poindexter had lost his parents and was sent to Lyndhurst Home for Boys where he developed his keen skill at accuracy through playing baseball, able to hit the same mark perfectly every time. During that game, Poindexter's coach, Bradley, had eventually made the decision that he would take Poindexter off the pitch to allow Kanon his chance the play, one decision which had greatly upset an already emotional Poindexter. Out of his frustration, Poindexter had thrown his baseball towards Bradley's head, cracking his skull and killing him, resulting in Poindexter going into therapy.

Fisk understanding Poindexter's mental state
Reading through the notes written by Doctor Eileen Mercer, Fisk had learned that Poindexter struggled to cope with the deaths of his own parents, and rarely acknowledged the death of Bradley, as Mercer diagnosed Poindexter with Borderline Personality Disorder while he was treated at the Riviera Psychiatric Institute. Fisk had learned that Poindexter grew up strongly relying on Mercer to guide him through life, and had broken down when Mercer had been diagnosed with a terminal illness, with Poindexter being recommended to find himself a job with a strong structure so he could continue getting better.

Fisk understanding Benjamin Poindexter's obsessions
Fisk saw that in his search for a structured life, Poindexter had briefly enlisted into their United States Army before managing to get himself his job at the Brooklyn Suicide Prevention Center where he had been provided with the script and a strong structure for his life. It was here that Fisk also learned that Poindexter had met and gained his strong attachment with Julie Barnes, who had also worked in there and had provided Poindexter with the support that he craved. Fisk discovered that even after leaving the job and working at the FBI, Poindexter had continued to be obsessed with Barnes and often followed her.

Fisk explains his plan for Benjamin Poindexter
Several hours of research later, once Fisk knew everything he could about Poindexter's youth and how to manipulate his emotions for his own means, Donovan asked Fisk what all of this work was actually about without getting into the specifics. Getting to his feet, Fisk told Donovan how he had just become New York City's scapegoat for everything that they saw as corrupt in their city. Fisk claimed that the public could be easily distracted and therefore all he had to do was create a new villain for the public to despise instead of him, believing that he could manipulate Poindexter into becoming that villain.

Return of Kingpin
Regaining his Former Wealth
Fisk overlooks his room being moved around
As had been agreed with the FBI, following his information leading to the arrest of the Albanian Syndicate, Fisk was supplied with all his former possessions, including furniture and artworks which were all brought into his Penthouse prison in the Presidential Hotel. Pleased to have regained much of the luxury he had missed, Fisk chose to wear a white suit, putting on his father's cufflinks, before Fisk stepped out onto his balcony and overlooked the room, delighting in seeing everything that was returned.

Fisk listening to an angry Benjamin Poindexter
Fisk then sat down at his table as Benjamin Poindexter came in with his dinner, with Poindexter furious as he had discovered that Fisk had pulled some strings to get Julie Barnes her job at the Hotel, knowing that Poindexter would encounter her and have this strong emotional reaction to seeing her once again. Poindexter, however, claimed that Barnes meant nothing to him. While Poindexter kept talking and then accused Fisk of having him followed by Felix Manning, Fisk remained silent until Poindexter finally snapped and threw Fisk's food over the floor, demanding that Fisk finally say something about all this.

Fisk explains his past to Benjamin Poindexter
Remaining calm, Fisk told Poindexter how, as a boy, he murdered his own father with a hammer, acknowledging that at this time he was still highly immature and had not had a chance to grow up and then experience the world outside of New York City, but had still killed his own father. Fisk noted that this feeling of being a child, standing over a father figure who he had murdered, was something that Poindexter would be able to relate with, commenting that Poindexter had been trained to hide these feelings during his time with the military and the FBI, to make himself into someone the world would tolerate.

Fisk tells Benjamin Poindexter about the world
When Poindexter furiously accused Fisk of destroying what he and Barnes had, Fisk claimed that it was not an honest relationship and that was what had destroyed it, leading to Poindexter claimed that he should have let Fisk die during the Ambush on the FBI Convoy. Fisk then stepped up to Poindexter and claimed that Barnes would have never fully understood him, and neither would a society that always punished people like him, before making the comparison between Poindexter's life and his own, which clearly angered Poindexter as he proceeded to storm out of the Penthouse, leaving Fisk alone.

Attack on the Bulletin
Fisk calling Benjamin Poindexter on the phone
Fisk arranged to have Benjamin Poindexter investigated by the FBI in the wake of the ambush, knowing that losing that structure would be getting to Poindexter. Just before Poindexter would have killed himself, Fisk called him at his Apartment, telling him about how his mother died while Fisk was in Ryker's Island, at which point Fisk had learned that she kept the hammer that Fisk used to kill his father, proving that his mother was proud that he had taken this action.

Fisk looks over all of his returned possessions
Telling Poindexter that he accepted him for who he was, Fisk then had Felix Manning deliver Daredevil's Suit to Poindexter with orders to go out to the New York Bulletin and kill Jasper Evans while he was still wearing it, promising that if he accepted this mission, then Fisk would never abandon Poindexter. As Poindexter then went out to complete his mission for Fisk and ensure that Evans was unable to give evidence against Fisk to Karen Page and Mitchell Ellison, Fisk remained in his Penthouse and looked over all the artworks that had been supplied to him, as Fisk questioned Nicholas Lee over why his beloved Rabbit in a Snowstorm still had not been returned to him.

Fisk learns that his plan has been successful
Once Lee had left, Wellers had all of their cameras turned back on, before hearing that there was an incident breaking out which he went to investigate. Fisk then calmly walked back into his room and went to the secret room hidden by his wardrobes and headed downstairs, where he found Shelby waiting. Fisk watched the live feed of Wellers and Doyle complaining about having to guard Fisk, before he told Shelby to put on the news, as Fisk watched reports by WHiH World News and WJBP-TV confirming that Poindexter had completed his mission, resulting in Daredevil being blamed for all the deaths.

Ray Nadeem's Question
Fisk getting his updates from Felix Manning
While in of his basement, Fisk was told by Felix Manning that Melvin Potter's attempt to betray Daredevil had failed and Potter had been arrested, while Fisk had then decided not to assassinate either Potter or Betsy Beatty, calling Potter irrelevant as Fisk asked about Benjamin Poindexter, as Manning informed him that he was laying low as they had agreed, although Manning had still noted that he was concerned about Poindexter's mental state following their Attack on the New York Bulletin Building, as Fisk then acknowledged he had already demanded a lot from Poindexter and told Manning to keep an eye on him.

Fisk is furiously confronted by Ray Nadeem
The meeting was interrupted as Ray Nadeem made his way inside of the Penthouse in order to speak with Fisk, forcing Fisk to return back upstairs and get into bed, so that Nadeem would still have no idea about his secret basement lair. Once Nadeem found Fisk in bed, Fisk noted that Nadeem should be with his wife, who he correctly named as Seema Nadeem, which greatly angered Nadeem who threatened Fisk if he spoke her name again. Getting to business, Fisk had asked what he could help Nadeem with, to which Nadeem then compared Fisk to Jack Kem, a gangster Nadeem had known growing up.

Fisk choosing not to answer to Ray Nadeem
Fisk asked Nadeem to have a little more faith in him, promising that he was a better man than Kem, noting that the luxury he was being afforded at the Presidential Hotel was the price he requested which the FBI had now paid. Nadeem demanded to know if Fisk let Jasper Evans go free from Ryker's Island in exchange for stabbing him, to which Fisk claimed that Nadeem had become desperate, choosing not to answer Nadeem's question as he wished him a good night and returned to his book, while the now highly concerned Nadeem then slowly walked out of Fisk's bedroom to consider what to do.

Fisk orders the assassination of Julie Barnes
Upon learning that Poindexter was beginning to rebuild his mental state through his friendship with Julie Barnes, Fisk made the decision to break Poindexter, as he arranged to have Barnes assassinated with the assistance of Manning. Watching from a screen inside of his basement, Fisk watched as Manning's men shot Barnes in the head and removed her body, as Manning then took Barnes' phone which they later used to send Poindexter several abusive and heartbreaking messages, knowing that he would not cope with this well and would be easier to manipulate for Fisk's next plans as a result.

Meeting with Karen Page
Fisk greeting Karen Page inside his penthouse
In the evening, Fisk got a surprise visit from Karen Page, while Fisk greeted her and acknowledged that he was not expecting to find her in there. Looking around the room, Page compared Fisk's time in the Presidential Hotel to his imprisonment in Ryker's Island, with Fisk noting that all of the luxuries must be offensive to Page who wanted to see him suffer following all the times that Fisk had tried to have Page killed, as Fisk had then noted that he was still paying the price for those crimes against Page.

Fisk is accordingly asked about his mother
As the tense standoff continued, Fisk offered to make Page a cup of tea, which she turned down as that was not what she was there for, before Fisk requested that Page take a seat with him at his table, acknowledging that Page had come there to get words from him at least. Having briefly sat in an awkward silence, Fisk was the first one to speak up as he noted that Page was not really writing an article about his mother for the New York Bulletin as she claimed, to which Page noted that she could while Fisk questioned what the benefit of this would be, asking if it would just be done to upset him.

Fisk commenting on the murder of Ben Urich
Fisk then noted that he did not enjoy intrusions into his private life, to which Page questioned why he had invited her inside his Penthouse if this was the case. Fisk then answered this by noting how Page had previously worked for Ben Urich, commenting that Urich's death was his final lesson, noting that Page clearly had not understood this last lesson. Page questioned if this was a threat, but Fisk only claimed that this was an observation which he had made. Page told Fisk that she went there to talk about what his mother had told Urich before Urich's death, commenting that she was also in that room with Urich.

Fisk being told about the New York Bulletin
Page began talking in more detail about how she and Urich had then pushed Fisk's mother into talking to them, clearly hoping to get an emotional reaction out of Fisk, but Fisk did his best to remain calm as he asked what Page's point was. Page went on to tell Fisk how his mother recalled a lot about Fisk's childhood, making a mocking comment by calling Fisk by Willie, as Fisk noted that her readers of the Bulletin would likely be as entertained by this small gossip pieces as she was, but Page mockingly claimed that they would only pass things like that around the office to get their own laughs.

Fisk being told about his father's own murder
Attempting to regain control of the conversation, Fisk asked how the office was following the attack done by Benjamin Poindexter, with Page questioning if Fisk had known about this attack before it had even happened. Page, however, remained calm and explained that the Bulletin intended to write a story about Fisk's father and how he had brutally murdered him with a hammer when he was still just a child. With Fisk struggling to cope with what Page was saying to him, so continued digging and questioned if there was any part of him that was not already broken, while Fisk began to regain composure.

Fisk telling Karen Page about her own secrets
Taking a breath, Fisk told Page that he had let her in his Penthouse because he actually had some questions of his own which he wanted to ask her. While Page listened, Fisk then asked her about her time working at Nelson and Murdock as a secretary, although Page still insisted that she was their office manager, with Fisk noting that she knew all about Matt Murdock's work, which she had confirmed. Fisk, however, then directly asked when Page became aware of Murdock's secret life and, although Page did not verbally answer, Fisk still saw in Page's eyes that this was indeed the case.

Fisk learning Karen Page killed James Wesley
Page, however, was not broken by this mistake as she instead asked Fisk if they could talk even more about secrets, calling him by his first name. Page then said James Wesley's name, which confused Fisk as Page asked what it had been like for him when Wesley disappeared, mockingly reminding him of the fear and stress he had experienced when Wesley was no longer answering his phone. As Page went on, Fisk's emotions got the better of him while she questioned if he had been angry with Wesley for disappearing on him, before Page made a comment that Wesley had died quickly, which horrified Fisk.

Fisk being stopped from attacking Karen Page
While Fisk could barely hold himself together, Page told him that he should not be worrying about Murdock and informed him that she was the one who had killed Wesley when she shot him multiple times in the chest, noting that she wanted to shoot him several more times but had run out of bullets. Filled with murderous rage, Fisk got to his feet and roared, but before he could attack, Wellers and J. Lim charged into the room and took Page out in handcuffs, as Foggy Nelson had just arrived there and claimed that Page was planning to assassinate Fisk, which resulted with her being removed before Fisk could kill her, as Fisk was then taken back upstairs for his own protection.

Poindexter's Submission
Fisk gets updates from Benjamin Poindexter
Mortified over what Karen Page told him, Fisk then contacted Felix Manning and asked him to bring Benjamin Poindexter for a meeting, having Manning's assassins just outside in case Poindexter did not cooperate as Fisk hoped. Once he arrived, Poindexter expressed his shock at seeing Fisk's secret basement. Poindexter then informed Fisk that Ray Nadeem knew about everything as he and Daredevil had just attempted to break into his Apartment looking for proof of his crimes, so they could expose both Poindexter and Fisk.

Fisk telling Benjamin Poindexter to scream out
Fisk remained calm and promised Poindexter that they would take care of this problem for him. Seeing that he was clearly distressed by everything that happened, including Julie Barnes' disappearance, Fisk got to his feet and then stepped over to Poindexter and made a comment that rage, such as the kind he was holding onto, could not just stay inside as it would become a poison that would kill him. Fisk told Poindexter to unleash out a primal scream to release that rage, which Poindexter did. Fisk then hugged Poindexter and told Manning to send his assassins away, deciding not to kill Poindexter.

Mob Boss Sit-Down
Fisk asks Ray Nadeem to remove his monitor
In order to keep Ray Nadeem from exposing everything about their recent actions, Fisk ordered Tammy Hattley to murder Winn and then threaten to pin the blame on Nadeem, forcing him to submit to Fisk's leadership. With Nadeem now forced him serving him, Fisk used him and the other agents now under his control to gather together all New York City's biggest crime bosses, so that Fisk could put forward his own dominance over them and then become New York's true Kingpin of Crime.

Fisk being escorted out of the hotel building
With everything now in place, Fisk was joined in his secret room by Hattley and Nadeem, as Fisk asked where Shelby was, while Hattley promised that she was on her way before she went to remove Fisk's Ankle Monitor. However, Fisk, in the show of strength, demanded that Nadeem remove it for him. Fisk then followed Hattley, Nadeem and the other FBI agents as they left the Presidential Hotel through a backdoor to get to their cars and make their way towards the crime boss meeting, while Fisk took great pleasure in seeing the horror on Nadeem's face as he realized how much power Fisk had gained.

Kingpin giving orders to Benjamin Poindexter
Knowing that Nadeem had contact with Daredevil, Fisk had him call him up and inform him that Fisk had just left the Hotel, in the hopes that he would turn up at the Red Fish Blue Restaurant and try and capture him, at which point, Fisk and his own team of corrupt agents would be able to ambush and finally kill him. Fisk calmly watched as Nadeem made the call before he left the car to check out the area, as Fisk then spoke with Benjamin Poindexter and told him to be ready, noting that Daredevil would know this would be a trap but would still likely come regardless, so Poindexter would have to be ready.

Fisk entering the Red Fish Blue Restaurant
Once he had been assured by the FBI that the area was secure, Fisk stepped into the Restaurant and greeted all five of the crime bosses, who had been complaining about the situation which they were still highly confused by. Upon seeing Fisk there, Everett Starr questioned what was going on, to which Fisk had told him that this would be an opportunity for everyone there. Fisk then took a seat with the crime bosses and informed them that he was offering them protection from any FBI investigations and prosecutions, although John Hammer was unconvinced and believed that it was actually a sting operation.

Kingpin meets with the other criminal leaders
With Sophia Carter also unconvinced by Fisk's offer and calling out to any recording devices that she denied any knowledge about the situation, the only one who showed interest was Rosalie Carbone, who had then asked how much Fisk was demanding for all of this. When Fisk demanded twenty percent of all of their earnings in exchange for his protection, Starr then furiously scoffed, explaining how he believed that Fisk was actually looking to get a confession from them so he could get one more month in the Presidential Hotel in return for sending them back into prison.

Kingpin kills Everett Starr to make his point
Starr continued showing great disrespect to Fisk, commenting on his white suit and the con he made to get into the Hotel, before telling him that he would not be contributing to his demands. However, just as Starr said this, Poindexter threw his Billy Club at his head, which fractured Starr's skull as he dropped down dead at the table, blood pouring out of his wound. As Poindexter, now dressed in Daredevil's Suit, stood by Fisk, the crime bosses, including Latimer Zyl all looked on his horror while Fisk raised the price to twenty-five percent, which Carbone and the others agreed to, much to Fisk's pleasure.

Fisk decides to return to the Presidential Hotel
As the meeting continued, however, it quickly became apparent that Daredevil had still failed to make an appearance, as Poindexter went in search of the Restaurant and found nothing, which caused Fisk considerable anger as he barely managed to remain seated without launching into a murderous rage. Poindexter then stepped over to Nadeem and questioned if he was actually the one who had warned Daredevil, but Nadeem insisted that they had all heard him on the phone and therefore he had no chance to warn Daredevil. Giving up, Fisk decided to return to the Hotel and make a new plan.

Fisk orders Benjamin Poindexter to murder Karen Page
Once they left the Restaurant, Fisk was informed by Wellers that they had located Karen Page who was hiding out in Clinton Church. Fisk sat with Poindexter in the car and Fisk told him how he rarely allowed people to know him personally, but James Wesley was one of those people who became a friend a surrogate son to him before Page had then murdered him. Poindexter asked Fisk if there was something he wanted him to do, to which Fisk had immediately asked Poindexter to murder Page, as Poindexter then smiled and told Fisk to consider it done, before stepping out of the car to complete his mission.

Exonerated to New York
Fisk returning back into the Presidential Hotel
Despite all Benjamin Poindexter's best efforts, Karen Page had still managed to survive the attempt on her life due to the intervention of the Daredevil who had come to her rescue and eventually defeated Poindexter, leading to a long hunt for her only for Detective Sergeant Brett Mahoney of the New York City Police Department to take Page to custody and then let her go free. Fisk's lawyers meanwhile completed their role in exonerating him in the eyes of the law.

Fisk listening to Benjamin Donovan in public
Stepping out in front of their New York City general public, Fisk was greeted by their abuse as many demanded that Fisk be taken back to Ryker's Island as they accused him of being a criminal and a cop killer. Fisk, however, had remained calm and watched while Benjamin Donovan stepped forward and addressed the public, informing them that the Court of Appeals had overturned the conviction against Fisk, officially making him a free man once again; however, this news only resulting in more furious booing from those general public who were completely disgusted by the new result which was in Fisk's favor.

Kingpin gives a public speech to the people
Fisk then personally stepped in front of the podium before the angry eyes of the public and reporters from WHiH World News and others as he acknowledged that they might find this news to be difficult to accept, but claimed that they had all been lied to and manipulated, accusing news like the New York Bulletin of planting fake stories that he was a criminal. Fisk went on to claim that he was merely a good man who had stood up against that system and corruption in their city and was then punished for it, which began to result in the public seemingly reconsidering their view on his case as they went silent.

Fisk finalizing his speech to all of the people
Fisk went on to claim that organizations like the Bulletin attempted to tear him down with their false allegations, while also sending out the Daredevil to frame him, using the recent Attack on the Bulletin as well as the Duel at Clinton Church as examples to prove Daredevil was indeed a criminal who was only now showing his own true colors as a killer following the murders of Jasper Evans and Paul Lantom. Fisk concluded his speech by asking the public to believe him, in that the Daredevil was, in fact, their true public enemy number one, which was met with stunned silence from the audience watching him.

Negotiation for the Painting
Fisk being freed once again in his penthouse
Once his speech was finished, Fisk returned back to his Penthouse where he had Tammy Hattley remove his Ankle Monitor while she had explained that the FBI would continue offering Fisk protection as he would officially continue to be a valuable asset to them with all of the information that he would not actually be providing, with Benjamin Donovan also noting that the FBI was terrified of what the public's reaction would be if he was killed in the near future, as Fisk had then calmly dismissed Hattley.

Fisk discusses how to get his painting back
Fisk then looked over his Penthouse, which was being covered with his artworks before asking where Vanessa Marianna was, to which Donovan explained that she was currently in the sky and had almost reached New York City. Looking at the last blank wall where he had intended to hang his beloved Rabbit in a Snowstorm, Fisk noted that the only thing left to do was to get it back, although Nicholas Lee had noted that they had recently doubled their original offer to buy it back but were still having no luck, to which Fisk told them that he would go there in person and make a more compelling offer himself.

Fisk first greeting Esther Falb at her home
Fisk went to the Residence of Esther Falb, the current owner of the Rabbit in a Snowstorm, as Falb opened the door and explained that she knew exactly who Fisk was and demanded that he remove his shoes before coming into her home, which took Fisk off guard. Once inside, Fisk first took a moment to look at his beloved Rabbit in the Snowstorm, commenting on how beautiful and peaceful it was, while Falb noted that the painting had been through quite a lot, noting that it was finally back home and questioned if Fisk had just come there to offer her more money for it as they sat opposite each other.

Fisk and Esther Falb looking at the painting
Fisk said that he understood that Falb became aware of the painting when he was sent to Ryker's Island and the painting was taken away from him by the government, as Falb admitted it was true. Fisk then explained to Falb how he had bought the painting from Marianna at the Scene Contempo Gallery and told her that he felt connected to Marianna whenever he looked at it, as Falb then commented on how power Fisk and Marianna's love clearly was. Falb explained her own relationship with that concept of love and told Fisk that the painting was not Marianna's to give away, which had surprised Fisk.

Fisk trying to ask permission from Esther Falb
Although Fisk still tried to argue that Marianna was unaware of the painting's true origins, Falb was just offended as she explained how during World War II, she personally witnessed the Gestapo coming to her family and demanding everything that they had, including that painting, which had resulted with the Gestapo killing her father. Falb asked Fisk if he knew what it was like to see his father die in front of him, but before he could answer Falb continued her story of how she was marched across Poland and suffered along the way, telling Fisk that the painting was her only connection to that lost family.

Fisk listening to Esther Falb's family tragedy
Falb then asked Fisk a wolf and claimed that it was men just like him who had killed her family and took away her ability to love, which had horrified Fisk. When Falb told Fisk that she would not allow him to take anything more from her, Fisk acknowledged that she had been through a terrible amount of suffering and had told her that he knew Marianna would want Falb to keep the painting. Getting onto his feet, Fisk was asked if this was meant to mean anything to Falb, to which Fisk claimed that while it did not, it still meant a lot to him. Fisk took one final look at Rabbit in a Snowstorm before walking away.

Fisk being informed of Karen Page by Wellers
Disappointed about that result, Fisk was being driven back towards the Presidential Hotel where he was informed by Wellers about their current situation with Karen Page, with that she had just been taken into custody by Brett Mahoney, which Ray Nadeem had just allowed, which would result in Page being allowed to walk free. Fisk took this news with considerable anger as he asked Wellers to give him his jacket, before wrapping it around Wellers' head and furiously beating him until Wellers was dead, as Fisk told the driver to pull over and dump Wellers' corpse into the street while Fisk relaxed.

Marianna's Return
Reunited with True Love
Fisk awaiting for Vanessa Marianna's arrival
Believing that Ray Nadeem had betrayed him, Fisk sent his team of assassins over into Nadeem's own Residence with the intention of killing his entire family out of revenge, only for Daredevil to arrive and help Nadeem and his family to escape. However, Fisk's concerns with Nadeem were put back when he learned that Vanessa Marianna was almost in New York City, as Fisk immediately went out to greet her helicopter once it arrived, although Johnson tried to give Fisk an update about Nadeem's escape.

Fisk is finally reunited with Vanessa Marianna
Fisk had then watched with sheer joy as Marianna stepped out of her helicopter and he was able to lay eyes on her for the first time in two years, ever since the FBI had taken him away to Ryker's Island and Marianna had then consequently been forced to make her escape away to Europe to ensure that she was not also arrested. As they had stepped over to each other, Fisk and Marianna had held the hands of each other as Marianna flashed a beautiful smiled at him and greeted him, which filled Fisk's heart with sheer joy. Softly resting their heads together, they took in the happiness of a long dreamed of reunion.

Fisk and Vanessa Marianna arrive at the hotel
Escorted by the FBI, Fisk then took Marianna back to the Presidential Hotel, while Fisk opened the door for his love and explained how the Hotel had three restaurants, a spa and all of the staff that Marianna could ever need. While Marianna clearly delighted in this, Fisk noted that everything he had listed was all theirs, admitting that he had just bought the Hotel for Marianna to enjoy, noting that their Penthouse had the best view of New York City, commenting that it was their city to enjoy now that they were finally back together, to which Marianna noted that it was clear everything that Fisk had ever wanted.

Fisk dismissing Benjamin Poindexter's request
As Fisk and Marianna had arrived on their floor, they found Benjamin Poindexter was waiting for them, although Fisk simply dismissed him despite Poindexter claiming to have something important to say. Fisk then showed Marianna the Penthouse, which had been decorated with candles and artwork ahead of her arrival, with the dinner table laid and waiting for her. As Marianna walked around in silence, Fisk offered to get her a drink, which Marianna turned down while Fisk commented that he had tried to decorate with his artwork as best he could, acknowledging that Marianna had better taste than he did.

Fisk privately speaking with Vanessa Marianna
As Fisk suggested that Marianna could curate her own collection to be displayed in the hotel, Marianna smiled and thanked him for being so generous to her, while Fisk insisted that he had only wanted her to feel welcome once she had arrived. Fisk then offered Marianna some food, however, she explained that she was not hungry but was just tired from her long trip back from Europe, as Fisk said that he should have realized that all of this could be overwhelming for her. Marianna then went upstairs to take her bath before going to sleep, leaving the disappointed Fisk stood alone inside his Penthouse once more.

Apology from Poindexter
Fisk looking at where his painting should be
The next morning, Fisk sat in his Penthouse and looked at the empty wall where Rabbit in a Snowstorm was meant to be hung, until Fisk was then greeted by the arrival of Benjamin Poindexter, who came with his breakfast. When Poindexter then asked if he could get him anything else, Fisk simply ignored him, until Poindexter gave his apologies for his failure at killing Karen Page which Fisk had asked him to do, as he instead blamed Ray Nadeem's interference with Brett Mahoney for Page managing to get away from him with her life.

Fisk rejects Benjamin Poindexter's suggestion
Fisk simply remained silent while Poindexter vowed that because of everything that Fisk had done for him, he would track down and kill Page, to which Fisk finally spoke up and had told Poindexter that he would have another agent take charge of assassinating Page for him. While Poindexter attempted to defend himself and insisted that he could still handle Nadeem, Fisk commented that he simply wanted Poindexter to do nothing, commenting that he now believed that he had simply put too much of a burden onto Poindexter's shoulders, which led to this failure, much to Poindexter's disappointment.

Hunt for Ray Nadeem
Fisk making breakfast for Vanessa Marianna
Later that same morning, Fisk made his traditional breakfast omelet as he waited for Vanessa Marianna to get up, as Marianna claimed that a long flight usually made her exhausted. Marianna thanked Fisk for making her favorite breakfast as she sat opposite him, with Fisk desperate to make Marianna's breakfast perfect as he questioned if she wanted anything more. Despite everything, Fisk suspected that something was wrong, as Fisk had asked her to tell him what it was so that he could try to make it right.

Fisk listening to Vanessa Marianna's past life
Marianna explained to Fisk that while she had been away, she had always been surrounded by his bodyguards, which lead to the life where she was always fine and the day was always nice, but nothing more. Marianna commented on one day she had in Bilbao where she was surrounded by hundreds of people and yet felt incredibly alone, as Fisk acknowledged that they had both been lonely since being apart. Marianna told Fisk that despite their reunion, she still felt a certain level of distance, as Fisk asked what he could do to change this for Marianna, still desperate to make her comfortable.

Fisk getting his new updates by Felix Manning
However, they were interrupted by Felix Manning's arrival as he first apologized and asked for a private word, as Fisk then apologized to Marianna before leaving. Once inside of his basement, Fisk warned Manning never to discuss their business in front of Marianna, before Manning explained that Ray Nadeem had still not been located, but suspected that he would be taken to the Supreme Court Building due to an increase in their security, which could mean that Nadeem could intend to testify against Fisk. Enraged by this update, Fisk demanded to know just how Manning had still failed to kill Nadeem.

Fisk furiously responding onto Felix Manning
Clearly nervous, Manning explained that Daredevil had prevented them from killing Nadeem, commenting that he had executed those men responsible but offered his resignation if Fisk still blamed him personally for this failure. Considering this for a moment, Fisk then calmed back down and had commented on how Manning had been able to keep Marianna safe in Europe for two years while Fisk had been in Ryker's Island, commenting that he would provide Manning with whatever he needed to ensure that Nadeem was killed and that Fisk would not be indicted by Nadeem's legal testimony.

Fisk accepts Felix Manning for his apologizes
Under Fisk's orders, Manning sent out his assassins to attempt to kill Nadeem as he and Matt Murdock made their way across New York City towards the Court Building, resulting in a furious chase across the streets which Nadeem barely survived. However, while Nadeem and Murdock made it to the building, Fisk had already threatened the jury, resulting in them choosing not to indict Fisk. Once this had been done, Fisk watched Blake Tower speaking on WHiH World News as he announced the news, while Fisk saw his success over Nadeem's attempt to return him to prison with considerable satisfaction.

Marianna's Involvement
Fisk visiting Vanessa Marianna in their room
With the threat of Ray Nadeem indicting him done with, Fisk had then returned into his Penthouse where he found Vanessa Marianna sitting alone, finding her beside Rabbit in a Snowstorm, while the surprised Fisk questioned how it got there. Marianna then explained that the painting had been a gift from Benjamin Poindexter who had claimed that he managed to convince Esther Falb to part with it, as Fisk noted how he had intended for the painting to remain with Falb.

Marianna then told Fisk that Poindexter had asked to be thought of as their new James Wesley, as she questioned if this was accurate, which Fisk immediately denied, only claiming that Poindexter could be useful to them. As they were talking, Fisk noticed a drop of blood on the frame of the painting, which was likely Falb's, before Marianna questioned if Poindexter was dangerous, to which Fisk insisted that it was nothing for her to be concerned about. Fisk promised that he would handle Poindexter, while Marianna demanded to know exactly how, despite Fisk attempting to insist that it was not important.

Fisk listens to Vanessa Marianna's statement
Marianna told Fisk that this was still important for her and insisted they finally start speaking plainly to each other. Marianna admitted that when she met him at the Scene Contempo Gallery, she was fascinated by his strength and brutality, making her want to observe him while she began to fall in love with him. However, Marianna then insisted that if he continued hiding things, she would still be as lonely in New York City as she was in Europe, noting how Fisk stopped his people talking in front of her and she wanted to be a part of his real world, although Fisk warned her about dirtying her own hands.

Fisk reveals his secrets to Vanessa Marianna
Marianna insisted that her hands were never clean and asked Fisk to share his life with her, as Fisk took Marianna's hand and asked her to follow him. Entering his basement, Fisk found Felix Manning as well as Shelby, who were both surprised to see that he had just allowed Marianna to come inside, with Fisk confirmed that he was keeping a watch on everybody he felt he needed to. With Fisk's permission to speak freely, Manning then gave Fisk and Marianna his new update on Nadeem, who had been found in his old Residence, commenting that Nadeem's testimony remained sealed and inadmissible.

Although Manning still suggested keeping Nadeem alive due to the public nature of his testimony, with Fisk suggesting that they force Nadeem to stand trial for the murder of Winn to turn the FBI against him and discrediting him in the press. Marianna, however, questioned how much Nadeem knew and how determined he was to hurt his business, before she suggested that instead they had Nadeem killed, telling Fisk to recruit Poindexter to assassinate Nadeem, which Fisk agreed to, resulting in Nadeem's corpse later being found in his own swimming pool, having been shot in the head by Poindexter.

Wedding Preparations
Fisk picking out clothing for his wedding
With Fisk's crimes now seemingly exonerated in the eyes of media, the people of New York City came to believe that Daredevil had set him up, Fisk set his focus on marrying Vanessa Marianna. While Fisk looked through his suits to find the perfect outfit to wear for their wedding, he also listened to the news as they discussed his conviction being overturned, questioning Karen Page and Blake Tower's recent attacks against him which were seemingly proven wrong.

While Fisk chose which flower to wear on his suit, he found himself still haunted by the image of his younger self, covered in his father's blood. Marianna then came to visit Fisk, showing off her wedding dress while Fisk questioned if he really looked as nervous as he was, to which Marianna simply smiled and admitted that he did, calling it charming. Sitting Marianna down beside him, Fisk admitted that he never believed he could feel such love until he met her at the Scene Contempo Gallery, also claiming that he did not believe he was even capable of feeling such a love for another person like her.

Fisk talking to Vanessa Marianna about love
Fisk told Marianna that he cared for her and her happiness more than anything else in his life. However, Fisk then also confessed that this concept had given him a terrible thought that perhaps his feelings were actually just a trick, and his vanity getting the best of him as his love for Marianna could just be due to how he saw his own reflection in her eyes. Fisk confessed that this thought filled him with dread, as he feared that he was unworthy of Marianna's love and was actually just a broken man, incapable of feeling that true love that he had so desperately wanted to feel for Marianna ever since meeting her.

Despite Fisk's confessions about his own fears for his love for her, Marianna still claimed that everyone in the world was already broken, and the trick was instead to find the person whose broken pieces fit with your own, claiming that their own broken pieces just fit together perfectly. Helping him chose an outfit, Marianna handed Fisk a rose to wear on his suit as he smelled it softly, as Fisk turned around and faced his reflection in the mirror, with Marianna sat behind him while they prepared to finally marry one another as they had planned for so long, ever since they had been separated two years earlier.

Marrying Vanessa Marianna

Fisk had invited several key figures in New York City's crime world to his wedding at Presidential Hotel, including some more high ranking criminal bosses from his previous meetings, including John Hammer and Latimer Zyl, who had arrived along with Rosalie Carbone, with both Hammer and Zyl still complaining about Fisk being so bold as to summon them all there at such short notice. Fisk and Vanessa Marianna then begun the wedding ceremony, with Fisk becoming momentarily lost in Marianna's eyes before continuing the ceremony.

Having said "I do," Fisk and Marianna then finally wed one another, getting a round of applause from those in attendance. Heading into the dance hall, Fisk and Marianna stepped out to greet their guests, as Carbone first congratulated Marianna on a beautiful gown and ceremony before also speaking with Fisk, with Carbone noting her amusement at Fisk having her sat next to the prosecutor who had attempted to send her to prison. Carbone noted that she had been satisfied when she made the prosecutor hold her purse, noting that she knew this was due to the tax that she was paying to Fisk.

Fisk and Vanessa Marianna dance together
Fisk and Marianna were both then called up to have their first dance together as a married couple, while almost every single guest took out their phones to record their dance. As Fisk happily danced with the woman he loved in his arms, they soon noticed that something seemed to be wrong, since everybody in the room began watching a video that had been sent to all the phones at the same time. While Fisk tried to ignore this, he eventually grabbed a phone and realized the video was of Ray Nadeem, confessing his crimes and the crimes of the FBI moments before his death, exposing Fisk to the world.

As confusion mounted, Tammy Hattley informed Fisk that something was wrong and several agents were down. At that moment, Fisk and Marianna looked in horror as Benjamin Poindexter, dressed back in the Daredevil Suit, got on the stage and gave his toast to the couple, having just discovered that Fisk had Julie Barnes killed. Poindexter then threw the microphone directly at Marianna's head, only for it to be blocked by the arrival of Daredevil. Fisk and Marianna were then dragged away to safety, as Daredevil and Poindexter furiously fought each other, both intended to attack Fisk for their own reasons.

Once they made it back into their Penthouse, Fisk had expressed his fury at Benjamin Poindexter being able to attack them and ruin their wedding, while Vanessa Marianna commented on the threat that Ray Nadeem posed to them which was why she had ordered his death. Fisk vowed to discredit Nadeem and get revenge on Poindexter, only for Marianna to tell him to hold back his anger so that they could escape, knowing Poindexter still posed a serious threat.

Fisk commented to Marianna that she had not made a mistake with marrying him, which she accepted but still pushed him to escape with her before Poindexter could come after them. Just as Fisk made it upstairs to the bedroom where he planned on escaping through the basement door, he found himself face to face with Daredevil. Seeing his enemy again, Fisk told Marianna to run, as Daredevil commented that everything Fisk had rebuilt was now done with. Filled with rage, both Kingpin and Daredevil roared at one another before Daredevil charged at Kingpin, knocking him straight through a wall.

Fisk soon gained control of the fight as he furiously threw Daredevil through a wall and began beating down on him with all his might until Daredevil was able to get back onto his feet and, with a few well-placed strikes, knocked Fisk down the stairs. However, Fisk became distracted from his fight with Daredevil as he saw that Poindexter had entered the Penthouse and was making his way to Marianna, as he intended to kill her in revenge for Julie Barnes' death. Daredevil, however, was the one to get to Poindexter first, kicking him away and getting Marianna to safety as he and Poindexter began to fight.

Fisk furiously punches Benjamin Poindexter
Before Poindexter could throw items at Marianna to try and kill her, Fisk had charged towards him and then began furiously beating him against a brick wall, although Poindexter's quick reflexes allowed him to dodge the punches as Fisk accidentally punched the brick wall, causing him considerable pain. While Poindexter landed some strikes against Fisk and hit him with a steel bowl, he had proved no match against Fisk's rage as he threw Poindexter up the stairs, beating him against the walls before launching him back as Poindexter had then smashed straight through the glass and landed on the table below.

While Poindexter was briefly taken out of the fight, Fisk was attacked by Daredevil, only for Fisk's rage to allow him then take Daredevil's punches as he punched him back and, with all his rage built up, lifted Daredevil straight into the air and smashed him straight through the kitchen table before continuing to beat him down. This was soon broken up as Poindexter attempted to kill them both by breaking a chandelier over their heads, only for Daredevil to kick Fisk back and roll away himself before it could land on them, while Poindexter had continued throwing knives at Fisk, hitting his protective jacket.
