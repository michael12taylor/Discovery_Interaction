Trivia
Due to the popularity of the character, Coulson was introduced into the main Marvel Comics universe.
Clark Gregg also voices Phil Coulson in the TV series Ultimate Spider-Man, where Coulson is drawn in Clark Gregg's likeness.
Coulson appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Adventures #1 comic book tie in to the TV series, The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes.
Clark Gregg also voices Phil Coulson in the TV series Ultimate Spider-Man, where Coulson is drawn in Clark Gregg's likeness.
Coulson appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Adventures #1 comic book tie in to the TV series, The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes.
During a flashback to his time in Tahiti, Coulson used the question "Did I fall asleep?" to which his masseuse replied "For a little while." This was a programmed response used in Joss Whedon's TV show Dollhouse whenever one of the characters was being brainwashed.
With appearances in Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, The Consultant, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer, The Avengers, over a hundred episodes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., one episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot and Captain Marvel, Coulson is the most featured character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Coulson has killed four major Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. antagonists: John Garrett, Daniel Whitehall, Grant Ward, and Aida. Conversely, he never encountered two other major Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. antagonists who were active before his death: Jiaying and Kasius.
Coulson was a fan of the Star Wars franchise and Call of Duty.
Coulson has his hand cut off, as a reference to The Empire Strikes Back. Every movie and television show featured in Phase Two has this reference in some form.

Coulson is one of only three humans to survive physical contact with Diviner metal, the others being Isabelle Hartley and Absorbing Man. Of these three, he is the only one who did not touch an actual Diviner but rather a contaminated Terrigen Crystal.
When discussing with Melinda May about a contingency plan in case he went insane like Garrett he mentioned that he likes kangaroos.
Behind the Scenes
In the films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Agent Coulson is generally depicted as a supporting character of the protagonists and used to represent S.H.I.E.L.D.'s presence in the plots of the films, to the point that Clark Gregg has described Coulson as "the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent". However, in the "Marvel One-Shots", Coulson is given "a chance to stand in his own spotlight for once", when the character is put in a position where there is an imminent threat and no superheroes around. The decision to give more focus to Coulson was "a natural" for "Marvel One-Shot" co-producer Brad Winderbaum.
Gregg has stated, "I think of Agent Coulson, after all these years, as a guy with a full life. I think every day he's somewhere doing something for S.H.I.E.L.D., and yet I don't always know what that is... There's always a different twist. In this one he gets to show more of his wisecracking wit, and in this one he's a little bit more of a badass."
Despite Coulson being called "the most recognizable face in the Marvel Comics movie universe", he is depicted as an "Everyman" in a universe full of superheroes – "the glue that binds" the characters together. In Thor, Coulson complains that Tony Stark "never tells [him] anything." In an interview with WNBC, Gregg explained his portrayal of the character as 'just a guy grumbling about his job "He's the guy who's tasked - a very disciplined guy in my opinion who possesses secrets that would turn your hair white - but at the same time he's tasked with handling these kind of diva superheroes, you know? Oh, really, Asgard? Dude, just get in the car".
There were considerations to bring back Agent Coulson in Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World or Avengers: Age of Ultron. However, Coulson wasn't slated to appear in any of these films. When asked about the matter, Joss Whedon asserted that "As far as the fiction of the movies, Coulson is dead", elaborating that "generally I [Whedon] feel like the S.H.I.E.L.D. audience and The Avengers audiences are not actually the same group, necessarily," and so the films would have to explain Coulson's resurrection again for the film-only audience if he were to be reintroduced.
When asked if there were any plans for the Avengers to find out that Coulson had been resurrected in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Jeph Loeb hinted that there were plans for it in the future.
In the Loki series premiere Glorious Purpose, no mentions of Coulson's resurrection are made when Mobius M. Mobius shows Loki clips of his actions throughout his life. When asked if he toyed with revealing that Coulson was revived afterwards, Michael Waldron said: "No, look, that is one other tendril of the multiverse, perhaps. I think just seeing mention of Coulson again, the very fact that it raises those questions, is exciting".

Andy Dylan, Vinny O'Brien, Dane Farwell, G. Grant Jewett, Casey Adams, Denney Pierce and Brian Avery were stunt doubles for Clark Gregg in the role of Phil Coulson.
According to Clark Gregg, the 'J' in the 'Philip J. Coulson' stands for Jaekwon.
