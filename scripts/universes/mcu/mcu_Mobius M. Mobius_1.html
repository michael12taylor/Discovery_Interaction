Mobius M. Mobius is a former agent of the Time Variance Authority who specialized in the investigation and analysis of particularly dangerous time criminals. After beginning an assignment to investigate Sylvie Laufeydottir, a variant of Loki who had been killing TVA agents, Mobius recruited another Loki variant in the hopes that he could help the organization stop his alternate self. An uneasy friendship formed between the two until the Loki variant joined Sylvie in her quest. After recapturing the two Loki Variants and learning he had been brainwashed and lied to by the TVA, Mobius briefly joined forces with them before being pruned by Ravonna Renslayer's Minutemen. Following his pruning, Mobius was sent to the Void, where he rescued Sylvie and worked with a team of Loki variants to help them defeat Alioth. As the battle against Alioth began, Mobius returned to the TVA through a Timedoor.

Biography
Early Life
Taken by the Time-Keepers
Mobius was a Variant who was taken by the Time-Keepers and had his memory suppressed so that he could be a member of the Time Variance Authority, an organization that 'protects' the Sacred Timeline from Variants.

Working with Loki
Mission in France
Mobius investigating 1549 France
Mobius, Hunter U-92, and two other Minutemen traveled to 1549 to the Aix-en-Provence, France to deal with a sixth known attack on the Minutemen. There Mobius determined that it was an ambush and the six attacks were most likely caused by the same person. 

Mobius looking at the depiction of the Devil
Encountering a wandering child into the building, Mobius told Hunter U-92 to stand down as he approached the child, apologizing for U-92's actions. After impressing the kid by showing him an animation and gaining their trust, Mobius asked if the boy knew who did it, and he responded by pointing to a stained glass depiction of the Devil. After promising to stop the Devil, he collected the boy's pack of Kablooie gum as a piece of evidence proving that a nexus event had occurred and asked it to be run for sequence and temporal aura, even though U-92 warned him that it was most likely futile. 

Mobius speaks to the boy
As the branch was nearing redline, Mobius told the child to wait outside while they reset the timeline. While setting a reset charge, Mobius was interrupted by an agent who had informed Mobius of Loki's apprehension for crimes against the Sacred Timeline.

Loki's Trial
Mobius asks to manage Loki
Mobius attended Loki's trial, and interfered when Loki was sentenced to by reset by Ravonna Renslayer. Renslayer reluctantly allowed Mobius to question Loki, but had put the responsibility on Mobius to manage Loki, warning him that his idea was bad. Mobius simply responded that he was following a hunch.

Investigating Loki
Mobius speaks with Loki
While escorting Loki to an interrogation room, Loki threatened to burn the TVA down, and Mobius offered his desk as a starting point, as it had a lot of paperwork that would work as tinder. When Loki was sidetracked by his first glimpse of the city outside, he wondered if it was magic, to which Mobius said it was not. Loki then believed he was in a nightmare, but Mobius said it was a different department and that he would help Loki if he wished to burn down that department.  

Mobius answers Loki's questions
In an elevator, Mobius introduced himself to Loki, who brushed him off and asked if he was being taken to be executed. Mobius told him that he was taking him to talk instead, and Loki said that he did not like to talk. Mobius then called him out on his lie, and also commented that he loves to lie as well. When asked how long he had worked there, Mobius said it was hard to say as time passes differently in the TVA. When Loki was confused, Mobius simply said that he would catch up. As he continued escorting Loki to the interrogation room, Loki asked if he was part of the TVA workforce and if he was created by the Time Keepers to protect the Sacred Timeline, to which Mobius said yes. When Loki laughed at the ridiculousness of it, Mobius questioned if he liked to talk. 

Mobius uses the Time Twister on Loki
Mobius waved Loki into the interrogation room and sat down at a table that held the device that could play the memories of someone's life. When Loki said he still believed he was going to be killed, Mobius commented on his lack of trust in anyone but himself and that he should slap that motto on a t-shirt while turning on the device. When Loki questioned why he'd never heard of the TVA, Mobius told him that he hadn't needed to because Loki had always lived within his path. Loki tried to ascertain his free will, but Mobius did not rise to the bait. He asked Loki to sit, and Loki tried to attack him, so Mobius used his Time Twister to transport Loki back to where he was standing before.

Mobius begins to interrogate Loki
Prompting Loki to sit, Mobius began the interrogation by asking for Loki's cooperation and revealing that he knew Loki would try to woo and then betray him. Loki disagreed and said that Mobius knew nothing about him, but Mobius said he'd like to learn. He told Loki of his specialization of pursuing extremely dangerous variants, and then insulted Loki when Loki assumed that he was a dangerous variant. He then asked Loki to answer his set of questions honestly in exchange for something Loki wanted. His first question was what Loki would do if he returned. Loki said that he would rule Midgard, and Mobius asked what would happen after that. Loki said he wanted to rule the Nine Realms and eventually the universe. Mobius mocked him slightly, but when Loki was offended Mobius told him he was a fan and wondered why someone with so much range simply wanted to rule. Loki told him about the "illusion" of freedom and how living things make mistakes with freedom, and Mobius wondered if he was an exception to this rule. Loki commented on how Mobius was simply a clown for the Time-Keeper's circus.

Mobius shows Loki his past
Mobius started the playback on the device, projecting the image of New York City onto the wall. Loki asked what it was, and Mobius explained that it would play his greatest hits. The first scene they watched was when Loki was tracked down by the Avengers at Stark Tower and asked them for a drink. Mobius cracked open a Josta and tried to hand it to Loki but Loki said no and commented on how he knew about this memory already. Mobius commented on how for someone born to rule, Loki's nature is to lose. 

Mobius continues to use the device
When Loki threatened him, Mobius turned the device to play the memory of Phil Coulson's death, and pointed out how Loki created his own enemy by giving the Avengers someone to avenge. Mobius then asked if Loki enjoyed hurting people while playing images of destruction from the Battle of New York. Loki said that his games wouldn't work, and that he was not a murderer but a liberator, to which Mobius played the memory of Loki removing an eyeball and commented on his smile and how he enjoyed it. Loki said he was a god, but Mobius said that none of his actions seemed mischievous.

Mobius speaks with Loki about his past
Trying a new approach, Mobius talked about how Loki was good at escaping, and played a memory of Loki being the famous plane hijacker D.B. Cooper. After the memory was done, Mobius exclaimed his disbelief at how Loki was the famous hijacker. When Loki asked where the TVA was before when Loki was meddling, Mobius responded that they were right there alongside him and that his mischievous tricks were all along his set path. When Loki asked why that had the Time Keeper's approval, Mobius explained that the Time-Keepers did not dictate the timeline according to approval and disapproval. 

Mobius continues his interrogation of Loki
Mobius asked what Loki was running from, and when Loki tried to stand up to make a point, Mobius used his Time Twister to sit him in his chair. Loki explained why he tried to stand up, and Mobius let him stand up for emphasis. When Loki asked him what he wanted, Mobius said he wanted Loki to be honest about his motivations and a deeper understanding of what makes Loki tick. When Loki proposed that the TVA was an illusion and a desperate attempt at control and affirmed his free will. Going off of that, Mobius played Loki's speech at Stuttgart, and Loki said that he was on the verge of earning what he was owed, not because the TVA allowed him to. Mobius told him to start taking this seriously and played a memory that had not happened yet, of Loki's trial on Asgard and him speaking to his mother. Mobius told Loki of how, when the Dark Elves attack, Loki attempts to send them to Thor, but indirectly causes them to kill Frigga instead, showing Loki her death. When Loki started to demand where Frigga was and started to accuse that it was fake, Mobius told him that he was always fated to kill his mother and that he always was and will be and continued to press Loki on whether he enjoyed killing people, and an enraged Loki attempted to attack him. 

Mobius helps Loki off the floor
Mobius used his Time Twister to transport Loki to the floor. Mobius told Loki of his predetermined fate to cause suffering and death, before explaining that his role was to help others achieve their best selves while playing a recording of the Avengers. Mobius then helped Loki up from the floor.

Cooperating with Loki
Mobius speaks with Hunter B-15
Before Mobius could continue, he was interrupted by Hunter B-15 and told there was a situation. Mobius slightly lamented that he had to leave as the interrogation was just getting somewhere, and told Loki not to go anywhere before leaving with Hunter B-15. Hunter B-15 then scolded Mobius for talking to Loki and told him that Loki should be reset. Mobius said that Hunter B-15 thought everyone should be reset and that he was getting good information. Hunter B-15 then informed Mobius that they lost another unit of Minutemen.

Mobius reentered the interrogation room saying that he and Loki could talk again tomorrow, before realizing the room was empty and Loki had escaped. Mobius, Hunter B-15, and five other Minutemen searched for Loki while Hunter B-15 commented that she wasn't surprised. Mobius told her that she shouldn't have interrupted them, and B-15 was insulted by the blame that it was her fault that Loki escaped. Mobius told her that he couldn't have gotten far, and the group split up into two. Hunter B-15 told them to prune the timeline and reset Loki on sight, but Mobius shouted back that they wouldn't be doing that and that Loki could still help them.

Mobius speaks with Loki
When Mobius had returned to the interrogation room, he found Loki there in some distress as he had played his main self's history on the device. Mobius told him he couldn't run anymore. Loki told him that he didn't enjoy hurting people, and he did it because he had to. Mobius asked for more, and Loki told him that it was illusion, a desperate play for control, and that he was a villain. Mobius told him he didn't see it that way, and looked amused when Loki admitted he tried to use the Tesseract. Mobius said he couldn't offer Loki salvation, but instead something better: a chance to work with them to stop an extremely dangerous variant who was actually Loki himself.

Chasing of the Loki Variants
Investigating an Ambush
Mobius prepares for the next mission
After recruiting Loki, Mobius tasked him with learning how the TVA and Sacred Timeline worked, although Loki was slightly disinterested. After giving Loki a jacket that designated him as a Variant, Mobius decided to bring him along to an investigation in 1985 Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where a team of Minutemen were attacked by the dangerous variant. During the mission briefing, Mobius told the group that they were pursuing someone who was both a time criminal and another Loki. He then displayed the other variants of Loki that the TVA had pruned, and outlined their common powers, which included shapeshifting, illusion projection, and duplication casting. He then split the group into two teams, including himself and Loki. As Mobius and Loki walked to the Timedoor, Loki questioned why the TVA wasn't concerned that he would regain his powers on Earth and then be able to betray them. Mobius explained that the TVA would be able to catch him easily and that if he betrayed them, he wouldn't be able to meet the Time-Keepers, an offer that excited Loki. 

Mobius in 1985 Wisconsin
Arriving in Oshkosh, Loki asked Mobius why the Minutemen couldn't travel back to before the variant attacked, and Mobius replied that nexus events generally destabilize the time flow and since the branch was still changing and growing, they had to show up in real time, before rebuking Loki for neglecting his training videos. As they arrived at the scene of the attack, Mobius noted that the variant had kidnapped Hunter C-20, and wondered why the variant was taking hostages when he had previously never done so. As the group began to spread out to search for C-20, Loki stopped them, claiming it was a trap and the variant was waiting for them, as he specifically wanted Loki so they could join forces and overthrow the TVA. After Loki proposed to warn the Time-Keepers, Mobius called Loki's bluff as a ploy to meet the Time-Keepers, and Hunter B-15 ordered the Minutemen to go on as planned and reset the timeline.

Mobius speaks with Ravonna Renslayer
Back at the TVA headquarters, Mobius spoke with Ravonna Renslayer in her office and told her that he wanted to make Loki cooperate, much to the annoyance of Renslayer.

Understanding Disasters
Mobius speaks with Loki about disasters
After getting Loki situated at the TVA library, Mobius went to the cafeteria. There he began to enjoy a salad, when Loki arrived shortly much to his frustration. Loki proposed a theory of where to find the variant and sat down across from Mobius. To Mobius's annoyance, Loki took his salad and Casey's drink to show him his theory about where the variant may be hiding. Mobius was told by Loki that the variant might be hiding in catastrophic world ending events since the variant's presence wouldn't cause a branched timeline. Mobius then agreed to do some research to see if the theory was accurate.  

Mobius works with Loki
Mobius and Loki went to the TVA library and began looking at files related to Loki's history. Recalling his trip to France, Mobius suggested that they look for any event with the Kablooie. After sometime, Loki found a TVA report and showed Mobius an event in 2050 in Alabama where a hurricane wiped out the whole town.

Mobius gets Ravonna Renslayer's permission
Before leaving, Mobius returned to Renslayer's office and told her the plan. Renslayer said she didn't trust Loki, but trusted Mobius. In the interim, she said as long as Mobius thought the mission was needed, she was fine with it.

Infiltration into Roxxcart Mall
Mobius in 2050 Alabama
Mobius, Loki, Hunter B-15, and a group of Minutemen used Timedoors to transport themselves to 2050 Haven Hills, Alabama to the Roxxcart Mall as a catastrophic hurricane was set to make landfall. Once inside the store, Mobius said he would take Loki with him, but it was decided that Loki would go with B-15 instead. 

Mobius finds Hunter C-20
While exploring Roxxcart, Mobius and the Minutemen came across Hunter C-20 sitting on the ground in one of the back rooms. C-20 told Mobius that it was all real and that she had given the Time-Keepers location away to the variant. 

Mobius runs to stop Loki
Later, Mobius and the Minutemen found B-15 getting up from the ground, having recovered from becoming enchanted, and watched as reset chargess were transported through Timedoors throughout the building. Mobius and the others soon found Loki standing by an open Timedoor and tried to run to stop him, but were ultimately too late and missed him.

Learning the Truth
Mobius speaks with Ravonna Renslayer
Back in the Time Variance Authority Office, Mobius met Ravonna Renslayer after her meeting with the Time-Keepers. He asked her about Hunter C-20's status and was surprised when Renslayer told him that C-20 had died. Mobius still was in disbelief that C-20 had died, since she had looked fine when he saw her. 

Mobius in the monitor room
Mobius then met with Hunter B-15 in the monitor room. There they watched the monitors in order to try and track down where Loki was. Upon seeing a branched line formed on the monitor due to the Nexus spark, Mobius sent two Timedoors to Lamentis-1 to rescue Loki and the variant. 

Mobius is reunited with Loki
After Loki and the variant entered the TVA Office, Mobius sent Minutemen to arrest them and take them to separate interrogation rooms. He met them in the hallways, and was asked by Loki why he didn't have the same equal protection that the variant had concerning the number of Minutemen around him. 

Mobius sends Loki into a Time Cell
Mobius and the Minutemen brought Loki into the interrogation room and Mobius holding his TemPad, opened a Time Cell. As Loki was forced inside by the Minutemen, he told Mobius that the TVA were lying to him. However, Mobius dismissed this as Loki lying and left the room. 

Mobius answers Hunter B-15's question
After leaving the interrogation room, Mobius was met by B-15 in the hallway. He was asked about C-20's status and Mobius was unable to provide a clear answer, as he was still unsure about what happened. He then told her what Loki had said about the TVA lying to them, before laughing it off and walking away. 

Mobius questions Loki
Mobius then went back and took Loki out of the Time Cell. He then invited Loki to sit at the interrogation table and discussed the variant with him. In order to see if Loki had developed any romantic relationship to the variant, Mobius told him that the variant had been pruned. After seeing the look on Loki's face, he said that it was twisted that Loki had feelings for the variant. Loki then told Mobius that the variant's name was Sylvie. Mobius then revealed that Sylvie was still alive and that he had been trying to get information out of Loki. Mobius was then told by Loki that he and everyone in the TVA were Variants and had lives on Earth before the TVA. Believing that Loki was still lying, Mobius ordered him back into the Time Cell.

Mobius takes Ravonna Renslayer's TemPad
Mobius then left and went to Renslayer's office, where the two shared drinks and reminisced about their friendship. Renslayer asked Mobius where he would place he would want to go if he could, in which Mobius said he could since they had access to all the timelines. Mobius then changed the subject and pressed Renslayer on C-20, but she evaded answering clearly. Mobius noticed a sword on the table and asked why it wasn't in the trophy case, leading Renslayer to get up and move it. During this time, Mobius switched his TemPad with hers. After Renslayer returned, Mobius told her that he had to leave and see about Loki, much to Renslayer's surprise.

Mobius sees footage of Hunter C-20
Mobius then went to the TVA's library and took out Renslayer's TemPad. Making sure no one was around, he scrolled through and saw footage of C-20 telling someone offscreen that they were all Variants and had a life before the TVA. He then saw that Renslayer was the person offscreen and deduced that she had been behind C-20's disappearance, making him think that she was into suspicious activity.

Mobius tells Loki he was right
Realizing that Loki had been telling the truth, Mobius went back to the interrogation room and entered the Time Cell, to tell him that. He then told Loki that Loki could be whatever he wanted to be, and could be a good person. Still, Mobius mentioned that he had to take the word of two Lokis, but Loki told him that he could trust him, as a friend. Mobius agreed to help Loki and Sylvie escape the TVA and exited the Cell.

Mobius is pruned
After doing so, they found themselves surrounded by Renslayer and a group of Minutemen. Mobius tried to explain that he had accidentally taken her TemPad, but then revealed that he wanted to go back to his life before the TVA. Renslayer promptly ordered the Minutemen to remove him from the TVA.

Trapped in the Void
Mobius rescues Sylvie
Mobius then landed in the Void, where he found an abandoned car and used it to escape the Alioth. He later came to Sylvie's rescue after her arrival in the Void, advising her the she should be more aware of jumping into a stranger’s car. He began to drive away towards Egypt, however Sylvie told him he needed to drive towards the Alioth as she had a plan to get out of the Void. Mobius then bemoaned that Sylvie really was a Loki, as he made a sudden turn in his attempts to drive away. 

Mobius speaks with Sylvie
Shortly after things had calmed down, Mobius and Sylvie talked about how the Time Variance Authority had betrayed them. Sylvie bitterly spoke about the TVA’s methods of keeping the timeline stable, to which Mobius apologized for the distress the TVA caused Sylvie during her childhood. Sylvie then explained how she proposed they get out of the Void. 

Mobius and Sylvie find Loki
The two eventually found Loki and met Classic Loki, Kid Loki, and Alligator Loki. Loki expressed relief at the fact that the two were alive. When Loki questioned Sylvie’s plan to enchant Alioth, he turned to Mobius, who agreed that Sylvie’s plan was far smarter than Loki’s.

Mobius speaks with other Loki variants
Later, Classic Loki, Kid Loki, Alligator Loki, and Mobius sat around a fire to relax as they prepared to execute the mission. Mobius revealed that he did not recall ever arresting an alligator variant of Loki, questioning whether or not he was even a Loki. When Kid Loki asked Mobius what he’d do should he get back to the TVA, Mobius admitted he did not know. He suggested perhaps telling everyone the truth about the TVA. Classic Loki noted that by doing that, Mobius would be going against everything he devoted his life to, to which Mobius responded, “it’s never too late to change.” 

Mobius leaves the Void
Shortly after, Mobius prepared to bid the Loki variants farewell as they began their battle against Alioth. He sent his regards to Classic, Kid, and Alligator Loki as they stayed behind in the Void. He was then given a TemPad by Sylvie, which he used to open up a Timedoor to the TVA. When Loki asked what he’d do once he got back, Mobius replied that he’d expose the TVA for their actions, saying he'd “burn it to the ground”, and thanked Loki for the truth. He put his hand out to shake Loki’s, but Loki instead decided to hug him. Loki thanked him for his gratitude, as Mobius snarkily whispered to Sylvie that she was his favorite Loki variant. Mobius then walked away and into the Timedoor, returning to the TVA.

Confronting Renslayer
Mobius approaches Ravonna Renslayer
Mobius returned to the Time Variance Authority and freed Hunter B-15 from custody in the Time Theatre, while obtaining a Time Stick. He then planned with B-15 for her to accompany Hunter D-90 and the Minutemen on a mission to Ohio in 2018 to meet Rebecca Tourminet at the Franklin D. Roosevelt High School. After receiving word on this and obtaining a pen from the school, Mobius went to Ravonna Renslayer's office and approached her, as she was packing her belongings into a duffel bag.

Mobius speaks with Ravonna Renslayer
Mobius told Renslayer, when asked if he'd prune her, that he would like to but wouldn't because they were supposed to be friends. He then was told that he had to be pruned so he wouldn't get in the way of a mission, but replied that the Time-Keepers were fake and that they were all Variants, asking what mission there was. Renslayer then called for D-90 to come to take Mobius away, but he told her that wouldn't be possible, as they all knew her secret and revealed her identity as Tourminet, showing her the school's pen. 

Mobius tries to reason with Ravonna Renslayer
Mobius continued to try and convince Renslayer that the TVA was a lie and that she shouldn't be trying to protect it, but she remained convinced that someone had a reason behind the TVA. Mobius then told her about free will, but she replied that only one person, the one in charge of the TVA, got free will. Mobius tried to convince her again, by stating what she had said about being friends across time, and accused her of betraying him. Renslayer snapped saying that he had betrayed her for two Lokis. Mobius told her that she couldn't take away people's free will, asking why she couldn't see that. 

Mobius threatens Ravonna Renslayer
Mobius watched as Renslayer used her TemPad to open up a Timedoor and asked her what she was doing, before suggesting that they both work together to change the TVA for the better, but she declined. He then told her he wouldn't let her go and threatened to use the Time Stick against her, stating he'd prune her if he had too.

Mobius is knocked to the floor
Mobius confronted Renslayer, but she disarmed him and kicked him onto the floor. She then aimed the Time Stick at him, but decided against pruning him, and deactivated it. As Renslayer grabbed her bag and proceeded to walk towards the Timedoor, Mobius asked her where she was going, and she replied that she would be searching for free will, before leaving. Later Mobius with B-15 would watch the timeline branch in to multiple timelines.

Kang's TVA
Meeting Loki
After Kang the Conqueror came into power of the Multiverse, he became the ruler of the Time Variance Authority. In doing so, he got different variants of Mobius and Hunter B-15. When the Sacred Timeline was branching out in many timelines, Mobius told B-15 that there wasn't much they could do to stop it.

Mobius doesn't know who Loki is
Mobius and B-15 went to the library and discussed how many branches were on one timeline. Mobius had just discovered that 63 branches existed on that single timeline when they were interrupted by Loki. Loki told them about the Citadel at the End of Time and how many variants of a dangerous person were coming. However, Mobius didn't recognize Loki, asking what division he was in and who he was, much to Loki's distress.

Personality
Mobius is typically an intellectual, mild mannered, and nonchalant individual. He tends not to show large amounts of emotion, but is capable of doing so is certain situations, usually when Loki does something he doesn't agree with. Mobius is also a bit more unorthodox than other members of the Time Variance Authority, having a certain degree of sarcasm and humor. Also, unlike other members of the TVA, he does seem to have a certain respect for the things that he would get to do if he didn't have the huge responsibility of managing timelines on him. For example, the greatest symbolism for this would be his love of jet skis.

When Mobius had discovered that Loki betrayed him, he was initially quite enraged and upset at his behavior telling him that the TVA pruned Sylvie just to manipulate him to get revenge from him for betraying him. However, when he discovered that what Loki was saying about him being a variant along with the rest of the TVA was indeed true, he went on to go out of his way to support the two, until he got pruned. Whilst Mobius was stuck in the Void traveling around constantly to escape from Alioth, he eventually allowed himself to free himself from the shackles of the TVA so that he could think about living his own life.

Abilities
Genius-Level Intellect: Mobius is considered, even by Loki, to be incredibly intelligent and knowledgeable about time and the many ways it can impact the past, present, and future. He believed himself to be Ravonna Renslayer's favorite analyst due to his intelligence and personable nature. He was able to predict Loki's plan when Loki kept asking to see and speak to the Time-Keepers as a way to overthrow and take over the Time Variance Authority. Albeit, this is because Loki is very predictable for someone considered to be unpredictable. He is also able to tell when Loki is trying to trick and lie to him, a very rare intellectual feat that very few people are capable of achieving in the Multiverse.
Expert Investigator: Mobius has investigated several time anomalies such as murders and robberies to track and capture time variants such as Loki and is humble enough to acknowledge that Loki has a gift for investigation.
Expert Interrogator: Mobius is very skilled in the art of interrogation as he was able to make Loki come to a difficult realization that he didn't enjoy killing people, but did it to feel a sense of control. He is also very good at reading people such as Loki, and able to form a shaky friendship.
Multilingualism: Mobius is capable of speaking and understanding all languages fluently, including English, French, and Latin.
Equipment
Weapons
Time Stick: This baton serves for beating and slowing people down, and Mobius goes with it for field work. The baton also serves for "resetting" people. He used it to pursue Loki when he tried to escape from the Time Variance Authority Office.

Trivia
In the comics, Mobius. M. Mobius was a member of the Time Variance Authority's junior management until his meticulous attention to detail got him promoted to the position of executive in senior management.
Behind the Scenes
To prepare for his role as Mobius M. Mobius, Owen Wilson didn't read any comic books but was briefed by Tom Hiddleston about the Marvel Cinematic Universe's lore, who showed him clips from other movies and how they all connected within the story: "Tom telling me about it, telling me about his character. And even in the way sometimes that he would describe his character, it was useful for me because my character Mobius in Loki is kind of interviewing him at some point. So it kind of worked doing it that way".
Chris Brewster was a stunt double for Owen Wilson in the role of Mobius M. Mobius.
