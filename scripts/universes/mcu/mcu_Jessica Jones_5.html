<html><p>Jones and Gelden sat in a car by the crime lab’s loading dock, reviewing the schematics of the building. There were a few stray hairs on the third floor of the building. They were all that was found on Nathan Silva’s rotting corpse. They belonged to Sallinger and they would put him away for good. Gelden had no idea if Jones was doing the right thing, but he would see it through. Officer Nussbaumer then opened the garage door and handed her a key card.

Jones made her way through the building only to find Costa in the crime lab with one of the doctors. Jones called Gelden for backup as she needed to get Costa and the doctor out. Gelden, while viewing the schematics, told Jones to take the western stairwell to the basement, where she’d find the sewer main. As the doctor began to analyze the hairs, Jones found the sewer main, causing it to back up into the building, forcing everyone to evacuate. Once everyone had evacuated, Jones made her way back up into the forensics lab, where she recovered the hairs and disposed of them. She returned to the car with Gelden, where he assured her that nothing had changed about her and that he didn't feel any darkness.

Discovering Trish's Secret
Jones was awakened by NYPD at her door. They had a warrant to search her home. Detectives Imada and Defford from the homicide division, led the charge. They had a few questions for Jones, starting with her recent run-in with officer Carl Nussbaumer. His body cam captured Jones approaching him, then he turned it off. Imada wanted to know why. Jones realized that they weren’t there for Dorothy. It was Nussbaumer who died. He was beaten to death, and Jones didn't have an alibi.

Dorothy’s body was taken from the morgue to the Edgecombe Funeral House, where Jones was expected to begin planning her funeral arrangements. But instead, her apartment was being ransacked and she was under investigation for the murder of officer Carl Nussbaumer. Imada suggested that maybe it was the grief of Jones losing her adoptive mother that caused her to kill Nussbaumer, but Jones denied having any involvement in his death. Detective Imada questioned what Jones and Nussbaumer had talked about after he turned off his body cam, but she refused to talk. Nussbaumer was beaten to death, but Jones’ hands showed no signs of an altercation. Inside Jones’ drawer, detective Defford found a file labeled Nussbaumer. Jones explained it was research as Nussbaumer robbed and killed drug dealers. A lot of them kids. Defford explained that one of those kids cracked her skull open with a bike lock, and if not for Nussbaumer, she wouldn’t be alive. When nothing was found in Jones’ apartment, Imada and Defford took the file and left.

Hospital Escape
After realizing that Walker killed officer Carl Nussbaumer and that Sallinger was her next target, Jones made it her mission to protect Walker from herself, by protecting Sallinger from her. Against the doctor's orders, Sallinger checked himself out of the hospital, though he was visibly weak and barely able to walk. Jones arrived to see him to safety, but Walker was only moments behind her. She punched Sallinger, but Jones allowed it to go no further. She threw Walker down the hallway and then escaped on the elevator with Sallinger. Walker entered the elevator through the shaft, but by then, Jones and Sallinger had already made their way through the stairwell, headed to the roof. Walker caught up to them. Jones attempted to reason with her, explaining that killing Sallinger would only put her in jail, which Walker was fine with. Jones claimed that she hadn’t destroyed all the evidence in the Silva case and that there was still a possibility to take Sallinger down the right way. He threatened to release the photo, thus exposing Walker, not that she cared. Still, she wanted to kill Sallinger, however, Jones didn’t give her the chance and ran to the roof. Walker followed. Once on the rooftop, Jones grabbed Walker from behind and threw her onto the neighboring building.

A Trap for Trish
Jones escorted Gregory Sallinger home and waited for Trish Walker to arrive. While doing so, Sallinger offered to end all this by releasing the photo and letting the police handle Walker. But, in doing that, he would face imprisonment as Jones claimed to have saved evidence against him. With binoculars in hand, Jones watched as Walker got onto the neighboring roof and looked through binoculars of her own at Sallinger's apartment. Jones hid behind a wall, so not to expose her presence. Jones then came up with a plan. Knowing that Walker was watching, Jones threw Sallinger to the ground, grabbed his ant farm and pretended to smash it over his head. Within the dirt that covered the floor, Jones found a camera, which Sallinger claimed uploaded to a server, but she wasn’t buying it and stepped on it. Walker cheered Jones on. Little did she know, Ducasse and Gelden were sneaking up behind her to taser her. After knocking Walker unconscious, Gelden zip-tied her, and Ducasse messaged Jones. After receiving the message from Ducasse, Jones left Sallinger’s apartment.

Catching Sallinger
Jones allows herself to be held prisoner by Sallinger to trick him
Jones returned home, where she took several more drinks and began working. However, it appeared as if her alcohol had been laced. Jones grew weak as Gregory Sallinger broke into her home. She then fell unconscious to the ground.

Jones woke up duct taped to a chair. Sallinger added a little something extra to the tranquilizer he knocked her out with, which caused partial paralysis, preventing her from using her strength. Sallinger took several photos. He was most interested in the lie that Jones told herself about why she wanted to be a hero. Jones claimed that she never wanted that. That was the lie in which Sallinger was referring to. He believed that she wanted to desperately be a hero. He called her "intentionally indifferent rebel-rock garb" her cape, mask and armor. Her chosen profession of private eye was even more evidence of this. Jones retorted that it paid the bills, as not everyone could live off their dead brother’s settlement like him. Sallinger wanted Jones to accept what she feared the most, that her family died for nothing. Jones always believed they were sacrificed in exchange for her gifts. That they died so that she could save the world. And now, Jones pretended as if she never wanted it. And she was terrified that she failed them, which Sallinger claimed she had, as she was not and never would be a hero. He then took several more photos.

Sallinger examined the photos, and in them, he found Jones’ truth. Sallinger claimed he lived in truth. Jones replied so did Dorothy Walker. She lived in her truth. She was ambitious, broken, sometimes cruel, but she owned it all, and Sallinger killed her anyways. He needed that logic because if they were worthy kills, then in his mind, he was not just a murderer. Jones called Sallinger out for being a fraud because he loved the kill. That was the real reason he killed his victims. It brought him pleasure. Sallinger denied the fact. He claimed to have killed Dorothy to punish them. With the admittance of having killed Dorothy, Jones revealed that she had installed a camera and that Sallinger’s entire attack was recorded. Jones then broke free of her restraints, knocked Sallinger to the ground and restrained him. Gelden came from out the room and assured her that he had it all on video, before punching Sallinger.

Jones called Costa the following morning to inform him how she had Sallinger’s confession on tape. She also had him on kidnapping and attempted murder. She told Costa he could pick Sallinger up at her office. While talking to Costa, Jones and Gelden were simultaneously ransacking Sallinger’s apartment, where they found his server. Along with the server, Jones took the knife Sallinger used from his apartment.

Hunting Hellcat
Jones began her pursuit of Walker after she killed Sallinger in the elevator of the courthouse. Jones left the courthouse following his murder. Hogarth stopped Jones as she wanted her to tell Walker that she wouldn’t reveal her identity and that she was nothing like Sallinger. Detective Costa informed Hogarth that it was time to give her statement and then looked at Jones, sharing the mutual thought that the masked vigilante needed to be stopped.

Jones returned to her apartment to find Cage waiting by her door. He’d been seeing her a lot more in the news as of late. She couldn’t tell him what he wanted to hear as it would risk hurting Walker. Cage had his own Walker in a sense. His brother, Willis. He started with nothing, but always found a way to lose more. And the lives that he ruined, that was on him. Cage sent him to the Raft. As much as it hurt him, it was the right thing to do. He was hoping Jones would follow his lead and do the same with Walker. Cage explained that going too far was always a risk and that if he were to ever pass that line, he would hope that someone stop him. Cage trusted that Jones would do what she had to do. After tracking Walker’s phone to her apartment, Jones called Gelden for a ride.

Jones entered Walker’s apartment to find her sitting in the dark. Jones wondered if it was worth it. Walker replied that it was horrible yet necessary. She was sorry for what this might’ve meant for their relationship, but she had to do it. She then prepared to leave for work. Her cover was more important now than ever. Walker claimed that she was protecting people from Sallinger when she killed him, though this only caused Jones’ concern to grow. She needed Walker to turn herself in. Walker refused. She knew what she was capable of, and she couldn't do that behind bars. The woman standing before Jones she no longer recognized. Jones worried that Walker would lose control and do something she couldn’t come back from. Gelden had been standing outside the door. He entered and a headache instantly set in. It got worse as he moved further into the apartment. The darkness surrounding Walker was so powerful that touching Gelden caused his eyes to bleed. It was over for Walker. Jones was taking her in with or without her compliance. Walker headed to the bathroom to clean herself up first. Jones realized this was merely a ploy, but by the time she checked in the bathroom, Walker had already escaped through the window.

The following morning, Ducasse and Jones watched a news report detailing the savage assault on Demetri Patseras. Jones hoped that Patseras was at least deserving of the beating he received from Walker. Ducasse reasoned there was a good chance of it as Patseras was connected to Hogarth. Jones barged into Hogarth’s office and accused her of hiring Walker to kill Patseras. Hogarth replied better Patseras than her. Hogarth’s clients were exactly the type of people Walker was after, thus making Hogarth her supplier. Jones needed Hogarth’s help to bring Walker in by using her as bait.

While in her apartment, waiting for Walker to undoubtedly arrive, Hogarth received a surprise visit from Kith Lyonne. Hogarth and Lyonne shared a kiss before being interrupted by Walker. Jones came from out the room and slammed Walker against the ceiling. Walker didn’t believe that she was Jones’ problem anymore, but Jones would beg to differ. As Hogarth called the police, Walker raced over to Lyonne and held her hostage. Hogarth pleaded with Walker to stop. She then pulled out a gun and demanded that Walker let her go. She even offered to find her a way out of town in exchange for Lyonne’s release. When Jones attempted to rush Hogarth, she shot Jones in the leg. With Jones down on the ground, Walker and Hogarth exited the apartment.

Jones posted a video on the New York Bulletin. In the video, she revealed Walker's identity to the world. After posting the video to the New York Bulletin, Jones and Ducasse waited. They listened to incoming police calls. Gelden arrived soon thereafter. Jones told him to hop on social media and search through the "Find Patsy" hashtag. Jones, Ducasse, and Gelden spent the night doing just that. That morning, Ducasse got a lead. A long-haul trucker said he spotted Walker in a silver Lexus. It was headed East, where the old airport was located. Jones told Ducasse and Gelden to stay behind as she wanted to deal with Walker alone.

Jones tracked Walker down to the airport. When approached by Sokolov, Jones threw him across the room. Unfortunately, there were several coffins, all identical. Walker was in one. Jones found Walker’s coffin, but before she could act, Walker forced her way out and made a run for it, but she didn’t get far, forcing her to fight. Walker kicked the circuit breaker, shutting off the lights, giving her an advantage. She simply wanted Jones to let her go. Jones couldn’t do that in fear that Walker would hurt someone else. Jones was completely blind, while Walker could see just fine, making it quite an even match as Walker traded blows with Jones. However, she didn’t have the upper hand for long. Jones grabbed Walker and threw her into the next room over, where she could see.

Jones thought this was all because of what Sallinger did to Walker or maybe even a side effect of her powers. But Jones realized that it had been there all along. She saw it when Walker shot her mother. And she could see it again. It was Dorothy who beat the self-righteous resolve into Walker. Walker thought she was avenging her, but in reality, Walker became her. Walker exclaimed that this wasn’t true and told Jones to stop. As Walker pulled out a knife, Jones admitted that Walker was right about the fact that Jones didn’t have what it took. She approached Walker to see if she did have it. And just like that, Walker charged at Jones with her knife, aiming for Jones upper body. She only missed because Jones raised her hand and blocked the attack, causing the blade to go through Jones' hand. Jones then grabbed Walker and slammed her to the ground, knocking her unconscious.

A Fresh Start
Gelden showed up at Jones' apartment with dinner and the New York Bulletin, with Jones on the front cover, the head title reading "Bona Fide Hero". Gelden thought it was cool and wanted to help Jones on her hero path. While Gelden may have been a good man, Jones didn’t trust him. He took that to mean he had to do something about that. He looked back at Jones and then left.

Jones packed her bag and left her apartment. On her way out, she handed Malcolm Ducasse the keys to Alias Investigations and told him not to screw it up. She then headed down town to watch as Walker was taken out the back of an armored vehicle and put on a helicopter, destined for the Raft. They exchanged looks, though neither spoke.

Upon hearing Kilgrave inside her head again, Jones decides to stay in New York City
After watching Walker get taken away to the Raft, Jones headed down to a train station, where she needed to get as close as she could to Mexico. She bought a one-way to El Paso, Texas to getaway. However, before taking the ticket, she heard Kilgrave inside her head telling her that it was all right to give in, as it was someone else’s job now. Instead of grabbing her ticket, Jones genuinely smiled to herself at the acceptance of embracing the hero life and exited the station, deciding to return to Alias Investigations and stay in New York City.

Personality
Jessica Jones could easily come off as being distant, rude, brutal, snarky and sarcastic. Towards others, she is nothing less than disdainful and blunt, carrying herself and her opinions out loud with little forethought or regret to insulting or showing disrespect to anyone. If aggravated or extremely annoyed by someone in her disfavor, Jessica could become an intimidating figure, such as against her rude neighbor Robyn. According to her childhood neighbor, she had been an introvert since she was a girl and only opens up to a select few of people, and even those she has difficulty expressing to openly and truly. Beneath her hard-bitten demeanor, however, lies a more vulnerable side, plagued by self-loathing and deep-seated insecurity.

In spite of her flaws, Jessica is a good person at heart, choosing not to waste the super-strength given to her at the cost of her family's lives and becoming a hero to help people. Unfortunately, the harrowing encounter with Kilgrave, who controlled her to do everything he wanted to, including being raped repeatedly and murdering a woman before breaking out of his control, caused Jessica to give up her life as a hero, no longer able to view herself as one, and preferring to keep a low profile as a private investigator. Though she openly refused to identify herself as the sort, Jessica does show signs of heroism as she is deeply sympathetic towards other individuals who have been "Kilgraved," including Malcolm Ducasse and Hope Shlottman, though at the same time, she was also fearful enough that she came close to getting out of town and leaving Hope at Kilgrave's mercy to protect herself, thinking she could not save her.

However, the combined trauma of losing her family and experience with Kilgrave has also made Jessica a somewhat unstable individual. She suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress and Survivor's Guilt, occasionally undergoing hallucinations and flashbacks of her time in Kilgrave's grasp. These hallucinations usually involve Kilgrave either whispering to her or being otherwise intimate while she is surrounded by purple lighting, referencing the purple lighting in the back of the restaurant Il Rosso, where Kilgrave always had their table. In these instances she can act out more erratic and violent such as punching the window of a subway train after remembering one of Kilgrave's commands. After the death of her family, no matter how close she bonded with a person, Jessica had great difficulty fully forming emotional connections to a person as she couldn't even tell Trish Walker, her adoptive sister and closest friend "I love you." After killing Kilgrave, however, she appears to have put several demons to rest, acting more affectionate and possibly closer to everyone than before.

Due to her trauma, Jessica developed a tendency to rely on alcohol as to deal with her problems. Frequently, she is seen drinking various types of liquor, to little effect. She states that most of her money goes directly to booze. Due to her superhuman metabolism, she is able to consume vast quantities of alcohol without damage to her liver and appears to have high tolerance, being able to quickly drink an entire bottle of wine during dinner with Kilgrave, then nonchalantly asking for another one. When inebriated, Jessica can become more violent, such as threatening Jeri Hogarth's ex-wife, Wendy, to sign her divorce papers.

Jessica is a highly independent woman and shows no interest in being in a serious relationship, likely due to being forced into one with Kilgrave. For a short while, however, she did engage in sexual and later romantic relations with Luke Cage, bonding over their similar super-strength and troubled backstories. Ultimately, she refused to allow herself or her friends be disrespected by anyone, especially men. To the few people she cared about, such as Trish, she defended them fiercely, but also kept her distance from them so as to not have them become collateral damage. Trish also implies she's had relationships before in the past, but none that are long term.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Artificially Enhanced Physiology: A private research corporation, known as IGH, revived teenage Jessica Jones from a fatal car crash that killed her entire family. IGH used genome editing to stimulate healing through advanced cellular regeneration. Jessica’s cells developed a new biological structure in response to the extensive bodily trauma suffered. Through rare interaction with specific DNA strands, the procedure not only imbued her with life once more but granted her superhuman powers as an unintended side-effect.

Enhanced Strength: Jones possesses physical strength far beyond that of a regular human, especially notable regarding her size and muscle mass. She was able to completely crush an alarm clock with her bare hands or throw a shoe into the ceiling hard enough to crack it, both times when she had tried to sleep off a hangover. She also could effortlessly lift the back of a slow-moving car, throw a gun through a wall, break metal chains, locks and hinges, bend metal bars and panels, smash through glass and marble with her fist and gently push down several metal cabinets like dominoes. Even as a child, she was strong enough to break a bathroom sink off a wall by accident and then lift it over her head with one hand. When angered, Jones' is capable of easily punching through the hood of a car. In combat, she can use her strength to easily overpower or rag doll humans, throw a person across a room or even send someone flying across a street with her full strength, the latter of which she did to kill Reva Connors via one strike to the chest. To defend herself from Luke Cage, Jones ripped a door off of a police cruiser to block his attacks. She was even strong enough to hold an elevator on her own during the escape from Midland Circle Financial with both Luke Cage and Danny Rand inside after the lift was sabotaged by Elektra. However, she is not invincible and it is not impossible for a large group of normal humans to overpower her, which was demonstrated when she was attacked by various people that Kilgrave controlled, as well as members of the Kilgrave Victim Support Group and Len Sirkes' men. In addition, Luke Cage is able to match, or possibly outmatch her, in strength, as he had the upper hand through his fight with her while he was under Kilgrave's influence. Will Simpson was also able to overpower her while she was injured and while using Combat Enhancers. Besides combat, Jones uses her superior strength to break door knobs and chains in order to enter places others are unable to. She was also capable of uprooting a large gazebo with relative ease, as well as heavily dent the metal walls of a train car by punching it. She was also capable of throwing Trish Walker onto a rooftop across the street from the one she was standing on.
Jones resists a taser strike from Cheng
Enhanced Durability: Jones has durability far beyond that of a regular human, being able to resist multiple beatings with little to no visible injuries. This resilience also allows her to perform greater feats of strength without injuring herself, such as smashing a mirror with her fists or breaking a window with her elbow. However, she is still vulnerable to gunshots and explosions, though the former only mildly affects her unless she is shot in a vital area, as being grazed in the shoulder with Audrey Eastman only caused her brief pain. She was able to survive being hit by a truck, which broke her ribs and caused one of them to possibly pierce her liver, and she later seemed weakened enough to be overpowered by Will Simpson while he was using Combat Enhancers. She was also slowed down by being repeatedly tasered by Kilgrave's guards when she first tried abducting him when Trish Walker was immediately knocked out by them. Robyn was able to knock her out with a wooden plank by hitting her head with it, causing her head to bleed and possibly giving her a mild concussion. Her bones and skin are also notable denser than a normal humans, which allows her to resist tasers and bullets, as well as punch the incredibly hard skin of Luke Cage without breaking her hand like most others, as well as punching the metal walls of a train car with no visible pain. She was shot point blank in her leg by Hogarth but sustained no severe damage for the bullet didn’t go in too deeply through her. When confronting with Trish, she ran towards her with a knife to stab her left hand but Jessica had felt no signs of pain from it.
Enhanced Speed: Jones' overall strength allows her to run at speeds superior to the average human. She was able to catch up to a car fairly easily, move across a street in a second or less to stop a car from hitting a little girl and stated she can run a mile in under four minutes. She effortlessly caught up to David Kurata down several flights of stairs and was quick enough to react to Whizzer running up behind her. She also surprised her anger management group by quickly killing a fly with both hands, and ran across her apartment to catch Vido Arocho before he could fall out of her window. She even caught up to a bus leaving for Montréal with Vido on board after his mother kidnapped him.
Enhanced Stamina: Jones was able to run across New York from Niku to the Shlottman's residence without tiring or stopping for breath, having very little to no build-up of fatigue toxins. While Jones was spying on Pryce Cheng, she was able to comfortably hold a wall sit between two buildings for an extensive amount of time with no sign of strain or discomfort.
Regenerative Healing Factor: Jones' augmented metabolism heals faster than an ordinary human being. Although not as advanced as that of Luke Cage's, she is capable of completely healing minor scratches and injuries in mere hours without any permanent scars, and major injuries like broken ribs in just a single day. It may also allow her to not be affected by the harmful and long-term effects of alcohol, leaving her only to experience brief intoxication and hangover while not experiencing any signs of toxicity. Because of this, to actually become drunk, Jones has to drink a lot more alcohol than an average human does to feel its effects. After punching a hole in the wall of her jail cell, Jones received minor scrapes to her fist and had it wrapped in gauze for hours until her hand was fully healed. Jones was even shot through the right side of her back by Cheng, becoming fully healed for about a day. When getting stabbed towards the spleen by Sallinger, her injury from the knife had regenerated but it left her to suffer minor blood loss and dehydration, which required her to take medication for the pain to heal within 2 days after. Her healing capabilities are not absolute, however, due to retaining the scar she received when Kilgrave commanded her to cut off her ear while under his control.
Flight: Jessica Jones can propel herself from the ground and through the air. While Jessica's control over her power of flight eludes her, she can cover great lengths and altitudes in a single bound, notably jumping upon rooftops and balconies. Jones herself calls such an act "guided falling" and "more like jumping and then falling." She used the ability to climb onto a fire escape of a building across from Luke's, as well as to reach Trish Walker's Apartment balcony. She attempted to fly over Luke Cage, who was controlled by Kilgrave at the time, to chase after the latter, only to be grabbed by the leg and thrown away. When Kilgrave had Robyn and members of the Kilgrave Victim Support Group attempt to hang themselves at Niku, she jumped and hung onto a pipe hanging from the ceiling that held up their noses so she could break it off and free them. Jones was able to fly across the bank lobby when she was evading the policemen who were shooting at her under Kilgrave's orders.  After fending off a few members of the Hand on an elevator, Jessica leaped up on top of it to catch the cable before it could fall, successfully holding it with Danny Rand and Luke Cage still inside. A demonstration of her using her flight to the fullest extent was when she flew skyward with Kilgrave in tow, escaping Will Simpson. Another full extent of this ability was demonstrated when Jessica grabbed Trish Walker and leap away to flee surrounding reporters.
Abilities
Master Investigator: Jones is a highly skilled investigator, using a multitude of questionable methods to achieve her goals. She often impersonates other people's voices on the phone to advance with her cases, and is able to easily connect evidence that other people may overlook. She is not afraid of using methods that could be considered illegal, such as stealing things, or breaking into private places, often using her superior strength to break doors and padlocks, in order to obtain clues and advance in her cases, often using her powers as a means to an end. She was able to successfully locate Hope Shlottman and Antoine Grier when she was hired to do so, and is often offered different jobs by Jeri Hogarth, despite her law firm hired their own private investigator, a position that was first offered to Jones, but that she refused.
Jones subdues a subordinate member of the Hand
Combatant: Jones has basic combat skills, often using her superhuman strength to overpower and rag-doll her opponents, throwing them several feet. Despite being the only member of the Defenders without any formal combat training (Daredevil and Iron Fist trained in the martial arts from a young age and Luke learned from the Marines, police and underground fights in prison), she, alongside Luke Cage was able to defeat a group of men led by Andre. She successfully fought off multiple people that Kilgrave took over, though she did not want to harm them and held back her strength. Also, she managed to gain the upper hand in fights with other combatants that had strength and resilience similar to her own, such as Luke Cage or Will Simpson on Combat Enhancers. Despite this, Jones lack of other fighting styles aside from using her strength has put her at a disadvantage, such that she was unable to withstand attacks from Elektra and was easily overpowered by Murakami before taking aid from Daredevil. Although she struggled against more skilled and experienced high ranking members of the Hand, Jones was able to defeat subordinate members of the organization, who are also trained in martial arts, without much effort. She later took on Pryce Cheng, a Marine Corps captain and quickly subdued him. While Luke Cage was being controlled by Kilgrave and sent to attack Jessica, Jones displayed adept combat skills, notably in boxing. She could dodge, weave and block defensively, and she could land jabs, hooks, and crosses in quick succession. She is also knowledgeable in rudimentary judo throws, which she demonstrated to a crowd of children when she wrestled with Sallinger.
Equipment
Items
Cellphone: Jones used applications on her cellphone to get information she needed for cases, such as a police scanner app she used while searching for Kilgrave, or a GPS app that allowed her to know the exact location of Trish Walker's phone. The specific types of phones she uses are Samsung Galaxy S5 and a black iPhone 8.
Camera: As a detective, Jones utilizes a standard camera and often collected photographic evidence for her clients to use for her assignments. She has also used it for personal uses when she took pictures of the affair between Gina and Luke Cage. On some occasions, Jones would use the camera on her phone, as she did to obtain a quality photo of Karl Malus to produce a fake ID.
Crosswords: During stake-outs, Jones is usually alone and gets bored; to pass the time, she would have crossword puzzles with her.
Hip Flask: The trauma Kilgrave gave her caused Jones to resort to alcohol to ease her thoughts; Jones carries a hip flask filled with alcohol to take a sip when desired on assignments.
Business Card: Jessica Jones has Alias Investigations business cards and gave one to Claire Temple. She also presented one to a former client of Pryce Cheng of Cheng Consulting Management upon rescuing their dog Felipe.
Laptop: Jessica owns a laptop in which she frequently uses to do research on her cases, able to track down people fairly easily through the internet. Often, she makes use of it to analyze images collected, either through her cellphone or photography camera.
Weapons
Smith & Wesson 4506: Jones took this gun from Will Simpson's arsenal that Trish Walker had kept, in order to ambush her mother Alisa and force her to go to prison. Jessica held her mother at gunpoint, who prompted to pull the trigger as she is now her only reason to live. Jessica was unable to do it, and as she hesitated, Alisa quickly overpowered her and knocked her out with the back of the gun.
Mossberg 590: Jones took the shotgun inside one the NYPD cars sent to Delaney Hall to investigate a disturbance, and was forced to shot a brainwashed Luke Cage in the head at point blank range, not killing him due to his unbreakable skin, but causing some internal injuries.
Nightstick: Jones briefly grabbed Dale Holiday's nightstick when she a blow while he was attacking her inside his house, and she then hit him in the head with the weapon, unintentionally killing him with it.
Facilities
Jones Residence: Jessica lived in this wealthy residence with her family.
Stirling Adams' Apartment: When Jessica and Adams started dating, she moved into his apartment, before he was murdered.
Jessica Jones' Apartment Building: It is a building located in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York City, that houses the office of the Alias Investigations.
Alias Investigations Office: After Jessica Jones abusive time with Kilgrave, she began a new career as a detective, creating Alias Investigations with an office in New York.

Trivia
In the comics, Jessica Campbell went to Midtown High School with Peter Parker and had a crush on him, being present when he was bitten by the radioactive spider. After a car accident killed her entire immediate family, Jessica fell into a coma and woke up months later by the cosmic energies released by Galactus. She is then adopted by the Jones family. During Jones' adult years, she became a trusted friend and ally of Captain America, and pursued a relationship with Scott Lang, with her best friend Carol Danvers acting as their matchmaker. She then realized she was in love with Luke Cage and pregnant with his child, so she eventually married him and had a daughter named Danielle Cage, after Danny Rand. During her superhero career, Jones was codenamed Jewel, Knightress, and Power Woman on different occasions and possessed superhuman strength, durability, and flight.
The superhero outfit Trish Walker created for Jones is similar to the suit worn by Jones in the comics when she was Jewel.

Jessica is 5'9".
Behind the Scenes
Melissa Rosenberg had Krysten Ritter on the top of her list for playing Jones, even when Rosenberg was developing the series for ABC.
Jeph Loeb noted that the character "has real problems with a number of things that she abuses! And we’re not shying away from that."
Krysten Ritter described the character as "very rough around the edges, and dry and sarcastic and a total asshole sometimes. But I think at her core she’s a good person."
She put on 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of muscle for the role.

Melissa Rosenberg was forbidden to have Jones saying "fuck" in the series as she frequently does in the Alias comic which the series is primarily based on.
Dejay Roestenberg, Stefanie Flores, Becca G.T., Heidi Germaine Schnappauf and Natalie Diaz were stunt doubles for Krysten Ritter and Julia Maggio and Nikki Brower were stunt doubles for Elizabeth Cappuccino in the role of Jessica Jones.
Krista Tunnell was a stand-in and a photo double for Krysten Ritter in the role of Jessica Jones.
Ana Rita Moreira was a photo double for Krysten Ritter in the role of Jessica Jones.
