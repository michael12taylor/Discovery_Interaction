Groot is a Flora colossus and the accomplice of Rocket Raccoon. Together, the pair had traveled the galaxy picking up bounties until they met Star-Lord and Gamora just before the four of them were captured and put into the Kyln, where they also met Drax the Destroyer. There, they agreed to work together to escape and sell the Orb for a massive profit. However, when it was discovered that the Orb contained one of the Infinity Stones which was being sought out by Ronan the Accuser, Groot convinced his friends to risk everything to stop Ronan's diabolical plans. During the Battle of Xandar, Groot sacrificed his own life to save his new friends. However, part of his destroyed body was planted by Rocket to birth a new Groot, as they joined the Guardians of the Galaxy.

As the new Groot began to grow, he stayed with the Guardians and endeavored with them on many adventures. They were soon hired by the Sovereign to destroy an Abilisk, but they were then targeted by their former employers due to Rocket who double-crossed them. During the escape, they had met Peter Quill's father Ego while Groot and Rocket, along with Yondu Udonta, were captured by Taserface's faction of the Ravagers, but Groot was able to help them all escape. Groot then joined his allies and assisted them in destroying Ego and saving all his friends, but Udonta lost his life. Over the next four years, Groot continued to grow and started exhibiting the personality of an adolescent.

Both Groot and Rocket then left the Guardians temporarily to accompany Thor to Nidavellir in order to help his mission to stop Thanos from completing the Infinity Gauntlet. After they had helped Thor obtain his weapon, Stormbreaker, Groot and Rocket traveled to Earth using the Bifrost Bridge and joined the Battle of Wakanda. Groot fought alongside Captain America and attempted to attack Thanos; however, when the Mad Titan amassed all six of the Infinity Stones, he succeeded in eliminating fifty percent of the universe's population, which resulted in Groot's death.

Five years later, the Avengers managed to resurrect the victims of the Snap, restoring Groot. Alongside Winter Soldier, he left Wakanda through an Inter-Dimensional Portal and joined the Battle of Earth. In the aftermath of the battle, Groot attended Tony Stark's funeral and rejoined the Guardians, now including Thor, on their adventures.

Biography
Early Life
Criminal Record
Groot is a hyper-intelligent, tree-like organism from the species Flora colossus native to the planet X. While he possesses human level intellect, Groot's robust and heavyweight physiology causes the organs of his acoustic generation to become stiff and inflexible, rendering the limits of his speech to the simple phrase, "I am Groot." Groot's extensive Nova Corps criminal record includes 3 counts of grievous bodily harm, 15 counts of escape from incarceration and 3 counts of mercenary activity.

Deals at the Hub
Groot was the frequent partner-in-crime of Rocket Raccoon. One of their adventures saw them travel to The Hub, where the duo rescued a family of sentient Scalluscs from the Stygian crime-lord Zade Scraggot, who was planning on harvesting the shells of the hapless snail-like creatures to use as tiles for his bathroom. Groot and Rocket had originally been hired by Sqqd'li, under the orders of his employer, the crime-lord Zade Scraggot, to acquire the Scalluscs for Scraggot, but upon learning the nature of their cargo and their intended fate, and that the Scalluscs could out-pay Scraggot, Groot and Rocket chose to rescue them from the crime-lord instead.

Quest for the Orb
Skirmish with Star-Lord
Groot is caught drinking from a fountain
Groot traveled to Xandar with Rocket Raccoon where they seek out bounties to capture in a crowded plaza. While Rocket was looking at the many Xandarians, Groot began drinking out from a fountain but was quickly caught by Rocket. Groot tried to tell Rocket that he wasn't drinking from the fountain, despite of lying from his mannerisms.

Groot continues to drink from a fountain
After Groot was caught drinking on a public fountain, Rocket then got a signal to locate Peter Quill, who had a forty thousand Unit bounty on his head. While Rocket excitedly informed Groot of the find, Groot distracted himself by drinking fountain water, much to Rocket's frustration. Moments before Quill had tried set up a deal with Broker and Gamora attempted to steal the Orb from him, Groot and Rocket had planned to intervene the conflict.

Groot attempts to capture Peter Quill
While Quill was fighting off Gamora, who was attempting to steal the Orb, Groot grabbed a sack and grappled his roots onto Gamora, however, Rocket told him to capture Quill. In pure rage, Gamora threw Rocket across the plaza, disarmed Quill from the Orb, and used her Godslayer sword to graze Groot's forearm. Once Quill apprehended Gamora from her possession of the Orb, Groot then captured Quill with the sack and followed Rocket to collect the bounty.

Groot mourns the loss of both of his arms
Groot's victory was short lived once Gamora recovered and shoved Rocket away, attacking Groot by slicing his arms off and end it with grazed hit on his abdomen. Quill then defeated Gamora from his escape from the bag and was later shocked by Rocket with his Laser Cannon. Groot was saddened by his loss of arms but Rocket noted that his arms will grow back and should quit whining. When the Nova Corps arrived at the scene, Groot and the group were soon arrested under their authority for breaking a couple of laws.

The Kyln
Groot arriving inside the Kyln
Once the four were taken away by the Nova Corps, they all arrived in their holding cells. Groot and the others were forced into a line up by the Nova Corps where all of their own criminal histories were presented for Denarian Garthan Saal by Rhomann Dey. With his arms growing back, Groot looked at the window and drew closer at the Nova Corpsmen.

Groot is taken to the Kyln for his sentence
The group were all sent to the Kyln by Saal to begin their sentence, where they all arrived together and continued their disagreements. While Star-Lord, Rocket Raccoon, and Gamora had started to discussed the Orb, Groot gave his input but was rejected out of spite from Quill. As Rocket told Gamora that he knew who she was and Quill agreed alongside, Groot tried to explain who she is to Quill but he couldn't understand.

Groot talks to Peter Quill at the Kyln
Gamora revealed to the group that she was planning on betraying Ronan the Accuser and selling the Orb to a third party. Groot began to speak to the group, which angered Quill into wondering why he could only say three words. Rocket noted that Groot doesn't speak well like the people like him and Quill, as his vocabulary is restricted to I, am, and Groot. Once Quill confronted the guard and demanded his Walkman, Groot watched as the situation had escalated.

Groot shows off his strength against an inmate
Once the four arrived at the Kyln, they soon established themselves as a team not to be messed with when Groot pushed his fingers inside the nose of the biggest inmate in the prison, causing him considerable pain. Groot, Rocket Raccoon and Peter Quill were forced to sleep in a large room with most of the other inmates; however, Groot was so comfortable there that he slept through an incident where Gamora was nearly assassinated by Drax the Destroyer, only to be saved by Quill.

Escape from the Kyln
Groot is unaware of the emergency alarm
After his restful sleep, Groot and the group had gathered their lunch and Rocket Raccoon talked to them about a plan to break out of the Kyln with Peter Quill and Gamora, as a team they would collect a prisoner's prosthetic leg and one of the guards' control devices attached to their arms in order to hack into the security tower.

Groot becomes enraged with security hoverbots
As Groot overheard about removing the prison's emergency lockdown, he decided to rip off the device that would've been used as the final step. By mistake on his part, Groot triggered the alarm, causing the whole prison to be on high alert. Groot was then under hostage by numerous Kyln Hoverbots that began to fire at him. As Rocket yelled at Groot's mistake for alarming the guards, Drax the Destroyer fought the guards that attempted to fire at him and Groot.

Groot and Rocket Raccoon make their escape
Once Drax came to their aid and tossed one of the guards' weapons, Groot became enraged and attacked the Kyln Hoverbots while Rocket began firing at them with great pleasure. Once Gamora gathered the green wiring that was required for the breakout, Rocket caught the item and told Groot move over to the watchtower. Ready for all of the others to regroup with him, Groot walked over to the railing where Gamora was and gave Rocket, Quill, and Drax help with climbing onto his roots in order to get into the security tower.

Groot and the team make their way to escape
Once the group got into the watchtower and locked the door behind them, they were soon found by a guard, who had gathered his team as they attempt to shoot the watchtower while Rocket worked. As Rocket then initiated his plan by switching off the prison's artificial gravity and took control of the Kyln Hoverbots to propel them out of the prison's docking bay, Groot was happily proud of Rocket as they make they're way to escape. Now safely out of the way of the Nova Corps, they gathered their supplies and left the Kyln before Quill retrieved the Orb back.

Meeting the Collector
Groot and the Guardians arrive at Knowhere
While co-piloting the Milano with Rocket Raccoon, they were headed for an inbound object that was about to approach them. As Groot had piloted forward, the group was informed that they're now arriving to Knowhere, a remote mining outpost in space that was built in the giant severed-head of a Celestial.

Groot gives a little girl a flower from his hand
When the Guardians traveled to Knowhere, they explored the premises while Gamora explained her reasoning of picking this particular location as it is the place to sell resources. Moving along the streets of Knowhere, they were met with some begging children, as Star-Lord warned them to hide their pockets from them. Groot then grew a flower out of his hand and gave it to a little girl that confronted him before. Accepting the locale, Groot had settled in the Boot of Jemiah with Rocket and Drax the Destroyer, playfully gambling on the Orloni's lives while Gamora and Quill conversed outside.

Groot fighting against Drax the Destroyer
As Rocket and Drax had drinks, they soon became drunk enough that he started to pick a fight due to Rocket's disrespectful personality, which soon escalated into a brawl. Having to protect his friend, Groot got in a fight with Drax, only to be tackled to the ground and pinned down by his throat. Groot used his roots to choke out Drax, only for the roots to be break due to Drax's strength. After Rocket began to fight Drax, Quill calmed them down before they could kill each other.

Groot introduces himself to the Collector
As the outburst had settled down, Drax left the group and walked out of the bar. They were then greeted by Carina who finally invited them into the Collector's Museum, in which it was housed by several species and items in cages. While Taneleer Tivan summoned them to his museum; Groot was seen by Tivan and introduced himself. Tivan found himself interested in Groot, and asked for permission in displaying his corpse as an exhibit, much to Rocket's dismay, which nearly caused another outburst.

Groot is informed of the Infinity Stones
After formalities were over, Tivan revealed that the Orb contained an Infinity Stone, which was unveiled to be the Power Stone. Tivian noted that it was one of the Infinity Stones that was conjured as a powerful elemental object created by the Big Bang; so powerful that only the most powerful of beings were able to wield it, even if the burden of the power was separated among multiple people. As Tivian was done, he had reached his drawer to pay them in Units.

Groot and Rocket Raccoon escape the room
As Tivan was withdrawing the money to pay the Guardians, Carina decided to end her misery under his control, grabbing the Power Stone. Once Carina grabbed it in an attempt to help her escape from slavery, the energy from the Power Stone had caused a massive explosion which devastated the museum. Groot managed to pick up and rushed Rocket outside before the ensuing purple fireball could harm them, while Quill and Gamora tried to survive by hiding away from the blast and Tivan escaped with only an injured forehead.

Skirmish on Knowhere
Groot is seen by Yondu Udonta's Ravagers
Escaping away from the power that the Orb had carried, Groot noticed Gamora had caught it, causing Rocket Raccoon to be frightened by the item inside it. As Gamora told the group that they should give the Power Stone over to the Nova Corps, Rocket objected her decision and suggested giving the Power Stone to Ronan the Accuser; however, Star-Lord proposed to give it to somebody who's not going to arrest them and has a whole lot of money.

Groot is told to stay behind on Knowhere
Before they could continue arguing, Ronan and Nebula arrived with their entire army of Sakaarans behind them. Having learned that Drax the Destroyer had called his enemy for a chance to kill him to avenge his family. The group then noticed the Yondu Ravager Clan appeared, with the former having been called here by Drax. While Gamora had noticed the Mining Pods and stole one of them by a bystander, Groot was told by Rocket that he could not join the group due his massive size and should stay behind until he gets back.

Groot saves Drax the Destroyer from drowning
Once Drax had been easily subdued by Ronan and was thrown into a tank full of spinal fluid from the Celestial, Ronan and his army returned to a Necrocraft which took him back to the Dark Aster as Nebula had reclaimed the Orb from Gamora. Noticing Drax nearly drowned in the tank, Groot pulled him out just in time and resuscitated him by stabbing Drax in the chest. Rocket returned and told them that Quill and Gamora had been captured by the Ravagers.

Groot decides to save his team members
Rocket then berated Drax for putting them in danger, making mocking remarks about the deaths of Drax's wife and daughter, which shocked Groot. Rocket said that he did not care how mean it was, as Drax's thirst for revenge was no excuse for getting them all killed. Rocket urged Groot that they should get to the other side of the universe in case Ronan would not find them. Groot insisted that they rescue Quill and Gamora, as they were the only friends they ever had and with Drax agreeing with him. Despite of his anger, Rocket reluctantly gave in.

Forming a Team
Groot reunites with the team inside the Milano
After the three flew the Milano to the Eclector and threatened to blow it up with the Hadron Enforcer if the Ravagers did not hand over Quill and Gamora, the tension was resolved when Quill let them know just in time that they had come to terms with the Ravagers. As the group had reunited inside the Milano, they reviewed recent events and decided that it was up to them to prevent Ronan the Accuser from destroying Xandar with the Power Stone.

Groot listens to Star-Lord's compliments
Star-Lord and Gamora criticized the others for almost blowing them up, leading Groot to call them ungrateful, with Rocket agreeing with his statement. Gamora then told the group that they'll have the Ravagers' help to save Xandar. However, Rocket rebuttal her claim that it they'll just give the Stone to Yondu Udonta so he could sell to somebody even worse. When Rocket belittled Quill for having a plan to be twelve percent complete, Groot stuck up for Quill for his thought.

Groot decides to join the Guardians in battle
Once Quill thanked him and told the others that Groot was the only one of them who had a clue, he began eating a leaf that had sprouted from his shoulder. Eventually, Quill pitched his plan to attack the Dark Aster, kill Ronan the Accuser and take back the Orb, although the plan seemed like a suicide mission, the group agreed to fight along side each other. Being inspired on how they would die fighting for the galaxy, Groot stood beside them and looked at Rocket, who finally stood up.

Groot prepares for the battle on Xandar
It didn't take long for the rest of the team to agree to help as well and they went back to the Ravagers' ship to discuss the details of the plan with Udonta and his men. Once the Guardians and the Ravagers came up with a battle plan and traveled to Xandar, Groot was ready for action and walked along with his team. Groot went onboard the Milano in order to confront Ronan while Rocket had his own ship and led the Ravagers for aerial battle against the Sakaaran army.

Battle of Xandar
Groot sits back from the battle with his allies
Star-Lord's team and the Ravagers put the plan into action and Quill warned Rhomann Dey so that he could tell the rest of the Nova Corps. As the battle began, Groot rode with Quill, Gamora, and Drax the Destroyer towards the Dark Aster. However, they were quickly attacked by numerous Necrocrafts sent by Ronan the Accuser, even managing to shoot Yondu Udonta's battleship out of the sky.

Groot steadily prepares himself from crashing
Just before they could all be destroyed, however, the Nova Corps arrived, led by Garthan Saal under the orders of Irani Rael. While Saal and Rocket Raccoon kept Ronan's entire army at bay with the aid of the Ravagers, Star-Lord flew the Milano onto the Dark Aster through a hole blasted in by Rocket. As they crash landed into the ship, the Guardians infiltrated the Dark Aster as Quill used the ships' guns to kill dozens of the Sakaarans inside.

Groot sends bioluminescent spores for light
Once they landed and left the crashed ship, they discovered that the Dark Aster was too dark for them to see so Groot guided them through the darkness by creating bio-luminous spores to create a strange light across the ship to show them the way, when Drax questioned how he could do it, Star-Lord noted the answer would likely be "I am Groot." Suddenly, they were stopped by Nebula, as she cursed at Gamora for betraying Ronan and Thanos.

Groot fighting against the Sakaaran army
As Drax shot Nebula with his rocket launcher and the threat of Nebula seemingly dealt with the team, they split up; with Gamora going to unlock the security doors while Groot, Star-Lord, and Drax made their way through the Sakaaran army towards Ronan's location. As they were on their way towards Ronan the Accuser, they were eventually confronted by a team led by Korath the Pursuer. Groot aided the group by thrashing Sakaarans across the room.

Groot finishes the battle on the Dark Aster
As Quill and Drax in a battle against Korath the Pursuer and were confronted by another large team of Sakaarans sent by Ronan, Groot prepared to use his powers by grabbing several Sakaarans at once with his tendrils and slamming them repeatedly into the walls. While Drax and Star-Lord witnessed the massacre of Sakaarans as Groot extended his arm and smacked around the soldiers, he finished his fight and smiled back at his group for their teamwork.

Sacrifice
Saving Friends
Groot watches Ronan the Accuser's defeat
As they continued toward, they discovered that the door was still locked due to Gamora being busy fighting against Nebula. Before long, however, the door was opened and the team charged inside to confront Ronan the Accuser. The group then attempted to kill Ronan with the Hadron Enforcer, which caused a massive explosion, however, he survived due to his Cosmi-Rod and knocked back the team.

Groot seeing the Dark Aster being set on fire
Despite that group was knocked back from the concussive waves, Ronan was determined to kill the Guardians only for Rocket Raccoon to flew the Milano through the Dark Aster, causing damages from the inside of the ship. Due to the badly damaged ship, Groot witnessed it being lit on fire and felt that the ship is falling down and heading towards the sky. While Rocket was seen by Star-Lord and was picked up to meet with rest of the team, Groot observes the ship's structure crumbling down and decided to save his allies from the wreckage by forming a large branch to protect them.

Groot sacrifices his life to save the Guardians
As Groot was forming his body into a protective crash sphere to save the other Guardians, allowing them to survive a crash from low orbit, Groot emitted spores to surround his team with light. As Groot had finished creating a large dome of wood out of his body, Rocket begged him not to do it or he'll die. Groot wiped a tear away from Rocket's face and told him that "We are Groot," before the ship had crashed.

Groot is suddenly reborn back from existence
Although Groot had died on impact from the crash, the team recovered from the crash landing and was discovered that Ronan the Accuser had also survived the crash as he prepared to destroy Xandar with the Infinity Stone. However, the Guardians had successfully channeled the Stone's energy and killed Ronan with it, ending the battle. Rocket then retrieved a twig from Groot's remains and planted it on a vase.

Groot dances behind Drax the Destroyer
Now onboard the new Milano that was given by the Nova Corps, Groot slowly began to grow into a new tree as Drax the Destroyer nodded towards Rocket for regrowing him back. After Groot had grown a little bit bigger, he began to dance to "I Want You Back" by The Jackson 5 behind Drax as he cleaned and sharpened his knives. Whenever Drax would look in Groot's direction, he would freeze until Drax looked away, but kept on dancing to beat of the music.

Guardian of the Galaxy
Battle on Sovereign
Groot arrives with Guardians of the Galaxy
A few months later, the Guardians of the Galaxy were hired by the Sovereign to defeat the Abilisk. As they waited, Groot punched one of the Orlonis as he believed they were looking at him funny, much to Rocket Raccoon's disbelief.

Groot dances to the music from the speaker
When the Abilisk had landed on the platform after Star-Lord had detected it with his Inter-Dimensional Tracker, the Guardians began to attack it with their weapons to defend themselves. Groot then plugged in the speaker system, in which Rocket had set up so they could listen to music as they worked. With some minor configuration, Groot started to dance to the music before the Abilisk had burped out a concussive wave, causing Groot to be mildly disturbed.

Groot introduces himself to Gamora
While the rest had began to fight the Abilisk, Groot continued on dancing and ignored the commotion. The other Guardians tried to fight the Abilisk, with Star-Lord telling him to move out before he was hit by one of its tendrils. As Groot had pranced along behind Drax the Destroyer's entanglement with the Abilisk's tendrils, Groot turned to Gamora, as she told him to get out of the way so he didn't get hurt before waving his hand in his greeting, much to Gamora's likeness.

Groot riding an Orloni in battle with the Abilisk
As Groot continued to dance, he was discovered by Drax, who landed behind him after his beating. As Drax tried to recover and get back up, Groot froze position of his dance and only moved slightly before Drax had got up and continued fighting the Abilisk. Groot then noticed a bug flying around him and began to catch it in order to eat it. While trying to eat the fly, Groot was found by Rocket and made him spit it out, much to Rocket's disgust. Groot then chased another Orloni and used his roots to ride around the battle until he was dropped.

Groot throws a rock at Drax the Destroyer
After he was laying down on the ground, Groot got up danced near the speakers and while being happy to enjoy it, Drax was thrown across the room and broke the speaker, causing Groot to get angry and attack him. While Drax went inside the mouth of the Abilisk, the Guardians begin to attack in the air, as Gamora cut its neck with her Godslayer to murder the Abilisk. When the Guardians had finally killed the Abilisk, Groot threw a rock at Drax for his cockiness.

Groot observes Rocket Raccoon's theft
After the Guardians had settled down from the reckless battle, Quill explained to Drax about the Anulax Batteries and how they are worth thousands of Units a piece in which is the reason why the Sovereign needed the team to protect them while warning them about the Sovereign people's transgression. Despite Quill's specific orders of not upsetting the Sovereign, Groot observed Rocket's theft of getting some of the Anulax Batteries.

Groot and the Guardians meet Ayesha
The Guardians then talked to Ayesha and were welcomed by her gratitude for there righteousness to defeat the Abilisk instead of risking her own people to fight it. Gamora then requested to release Nebula for her imprisonment and be handed over to them as payment. Ayesha then curious on behalf of Quill's heritage and talked about Quill's father about how he could possibly be reckless. As the Sovereign became aggressive from Rocket's insults to the Sovereign, the team had walk away from the room and exit the planet.

Left on Berhert
Groot watches the planet out from the window
As the Guardians of the Galaxy left Sovereign and flew away into with the Milano, Rocket Raccoon tells the team that they'll have to get Nebula back to Xandar and collect that bounty. Groot watched out the window of the Milano as the Guardians flew away from the planet.

Groot suffers from a crash of the Milano
The Guardians were quickly followed by the Sovereign fleet, who were furious with Rocket for stealing their Anulax Batteries. As Gamora had questioned the team on why the Sovereign had followed them, Drax the Destroyer accidentally revealed to them that Rocket had stolen their batteries. After the Sovereign began to fire at the team, they maneuvered towards an asteroid field. When Rocket and Star-Lord started arguing, they crashed into an asteroid, causing Groot to be pulled back and was catch and passed along the team.

Groot eats food before crashing on Berhert
As a particular Sovereign craft tried to attack the Milano, Drax began to use one of the laser rifles and Holographic Space Suits to destroy one of the Sovereign spacecrafts that was piloted by Zylak. Once out of the asteroid field, more Sovereign fleets approached from both sides of the team, only for a man to destroy them all. Once the team had finally reached to Berhert, the ship was badly damaged from the battle. While Gamora had tried to save Drax from the outside hull, Star-Lord looked over his shoulder and noticed Groot eating candy before crashing in a forest.

Groot sits down and relaxes after the crash
After crashing on Berhert, Groot sat down at the broken ship while the Guardians had argued about the destruction of the Milano. After Rocket and Star-Lord became bitter towards each other, Nebula warns the team that incoming ship had followed them to Berhert. As the unknown ship had landed, they were introduced by Ego, Peter Quill's father. After settling down in a campfire and acknowledge Ego's perspective, the few team members decided to visit his planet.

Groot waves at Gamora before she left Berhert
As Gamora, Star-Lord, and Drax had packed up to leave Berhert to go to Ego's planet, Groot and Rocket were informed that they will stay behind with Nebula. After Gamora had made sure for Rocket to keep an eye on Nebula while he was repairing the ship with the Nanobot Welder, Groot was met up with her and was told that she will come back after a couple of days. As the group had left the ship, Groot waved at Gamora while giving her a sad smile.

Groot considers releasing Nebula
During the night, the Ravagers arrived on Berhert after tracking the Guardians, unaware that Rocket had set some traps. Groot stayed in the Milano with a speaker to contact Rocket. Eventually, Rocket had been apprehended by the Ravagers, deeply worrying Groot. Despite Gamora's orders, Groot was convinced by Nebula to free her from her bonds so she could save Rocket. After trusting Nebula's actions, Groot freed her from her restraints but was tricked, causing him and Rocket, along with Yondu Udonta to be taken by the Ravagers.

Abused by Ravagers
Groot is captured by the Ravagers
After getting captured by the Ravagers, Groot, Rocket Raccoon, and Yondu Udonta were taken to the Eclector where the Ravagers who sided with Udonta were being executed. While the Ravagers send their own people into space, Groot was stuck in a cage and was scared out of his mind when Retch tried to intimidate him.

Groot hysterically laughs at Taserface's name
Taserface took control of the Ravagers and began to beat up Udonta until Rocket was laughing out loud at the declaration of the Taserface's leadership of their Ravager clan. Taserface then questioned Rocket on what he was laughing at, to which Rocket responded that he thinks Taserface made up his name in order to sound cool.
