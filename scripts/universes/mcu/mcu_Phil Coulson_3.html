<html><p>Coulson and the team prepared to enter the Guest House, which was not a S.H.I.E.L.D base, figuring that there might be hostiles. Agents Triplett and May were left aboard the Bus in case their skills were needed there. The field team reached the doors, only to be greeted with the protocol sentence, "How was the drive from Istanbul?" After many attempts to convince the occupants to help (while they repeated the same sentence three times), they decided they needed to say "pretty please" and broke into the hostile environment. Communications went down, but they continued in spite of it.

Coulson discovers the alien corpse which saved his life
Coulson found the operating room where he was resurrected, and experienced flashbacks of the horrific procedure. Garrett and Ward continued to look for the triggering device after figuring out that the timer was separate from the actual explosive. Coulson entered an area marked for radiation and refused to put on a suit despite Fitz's warning, because there was no time. 

Coulson and Garrett arrive on the Bus
Coulson was found by Garrett, who told him not to let Skye take the drug. They barely made it back on the Bus, which took off in a huge explosion. Coulson entered the medical pod yelling for them to not administer the drug, but Simmons had already proceeded.

Coulson was confronted by May, who congratulated him for doing the impossible by saving Skye, and asked why he was not happy about it. Coulson flashed back to entering the room marked T.A.H.I.T.I. and finding that the drug was being extracted from half of a corpse of an unknown alien in a cryotube. He concealed this from May, saying that he did not want Skye to suffer as he had. He left to sit with Skye as she recovered.

Working with Lady Sif
Coulson reuniting with Sif
Coulson and his team investigated an energy reading in the desert, consistent with the imminent arrival of Asgardians. They encountered Sif, who had come to Earth seeking Lorelei. Sif explained that Lorelei had escaped imprisonment in Asgard during the attack of the Dark Elves, and that to neutralize her power to control the minds of men, she would have to fit a special collar around Lorelei's neck that prevented her from speaking.

Coulson and his team with Sif confronting Lorelei
Coulson and his team, along with Sif, arrive at Rosie's Desert Oasis, where they met with policemen who were already enthralled by Lorelei. The police shot at them. While Coulson and Ward dealt with the policemen and the Dogs of Hell who were stationed outside the building, Sif entered and confronted Lorelei who was accompanied by several Dogs of Hell. Lorelei enthralled Ward and the two escaped together.

When Coulson, Sif, and a S.H.I.E.L.D. team caught up with them, the two were nowhere to be found. The team realized it was too late. Ward and Lorelei, planning to eliminate any threats to Lorelei's rule, had commandeered the Bus, with help from an enchanted Fitz, who had locked Sif in the interrogation room, and imprisoned Simmons and Skye in the recovery room. Coulson, pretending to be under Lorelei's power as well, learned of Simmons' location and freed her. Lorelei encountered May and claimed that Ward revealed to her that despite their sexual relationship, his heart was with someone other than May.

Coulson say goodbye to Sif
The team defeated Lorelei. Sif thanked Coulson for the team's aid and said that she would bring Lorelei back to Asgard on Odin's orders. She said she would let Coulson be the one to tell Thor he was not deceased. Coulson approached Skye and confesses that he discovered that the drug used to revive them both was alien in origin. Despite how disturbed Coulson was by this fact, Skye remained optimistic. Coulson swore they would get answers, beginning with tracking down the Clairvoyant. He ordered Skye to keep the origin of the drug a secret until Fury gave them the truth.

Chasing Deathlok
Coulson reacts to Thomas Nash's death
Coulson threatening Melinda May
Coulson and his team went to an abandoned racetrack where they found Deathlok and Thomas Nash. Nash was later killed by Grant Ward because Nash appeared to be the Clairvoyant. Coulson grew concerned because the case was solved too easily. When Skye discovered that S.H.I.E.L.D. psychological files had the same information the Clairvoyant knew, Coulson realized that the Clairvoyant was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, not a psychic. Believing that Ward killed Nash to cover up his tracks, Coulson interrogated him and Ward denied having any association with the Centipede Project. Skye entered to tell Coulson that Melinda May had a secret phone line on the plane. Coulson, believing that May was working with the Clairvoyant, held her at gunpoint. Suddenly, Victoria Hand took over the Bus and ordered her men to kill everyone on board except Coulson, whom she wanted taken alive.

HYDRA Uprising
Battle at the Hub
Coulson learns John Garrett is the Clairvoyant
After Captain America exposed to the public that HYDRA had been growing inside of S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA agents sent out a secret message to other agents that it was time to reveal themselves. Coulson and his team, along with Agent John Garrett, received the message and concluded that Victoria Hand must be the Clairvoyant. Hand was leading them to the Hub to be killed, and knowing that Jemma Simmons was there, Coulson's Team and Garrett decided to fight their way through the teams of HYDRA agents to rescue Simmons and capture Hand.

Coulson blocking John Garrett's attack
Coulson argued with Garrett about whether they should kill Hand or just capture her. Coulson figured out that Garrett was the Clairvoyant, when Garrett accidentally revealed that Raina and Coulson were both in the Theta Brain-Wave Frequency Machine, something Coulson did not include in his report. Coulson then realized that Garrett had masterminded everything, including his torture and Skye's being shot, all so Coulson could lead Garrett to the Guest House. Suddenly, a group of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents burst in. Coulson ordered them to arrest Garrett, identifying him as the true Clairvoyant. Garrett ordered the HYDRA sleeper agents in the team to execute the legitimate S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Coulson rejected Garrett's offer to join HYDRA. As Garrett prepared to execute all of them, the group was rescued when Skye and Grant Ward successfully blew up the main generator. 

Coulson and Victoria Hand
Coulson and the team then subdued Garrett and his men, as Hand arrived having heard Garrett's confession. The true S.H.I.E.L.D. agents took all HYDRA agents into custody. Hand told Coulson to stay in contact. With Nick Fury presumed dead, they were the two highest ranking agents alive who were not HYDRA.

How to Survive
Coulson meeting Eric Koenig
After the attack on the Hub, Colonel Glenn Talbot contacted Coulson and told him that he would be sending a peacekeeping force to establish order. Coulson, seeing through Talbot's lie, immediately left the Hub with his team and Agent Antoine Triplett. After taking off on the Bus, Coulson, knowing that every government agency would be after them, had Skye collect everyone's badges and delete all of their information. Coulson received some coordinates. Believing that only Nick Fury could have sent them, Coulson took a leap of faith and followed the coordinates. They led to a secret base called Providence. There they met Agent Eric Koenig, who revealed to Coulson that Fury was indeed still alive. Koenig threatened Coulson not to inform the rest of his team, as only he, Captain America, and Maria Hill were trusted to know Fury's status.

The Cellist
Coulson saying goodbye to Audrey Nathan
Grant Ward soon arrived at Providence. He told the group that HYDRA had raided the Fridge, taken all of the weapons S.H.I.E.L.D. had recovered, and released the entire criminal population. That included Marcus Daniels, a man Coulson had put away after he began stalking Coulson's former lover, Audrey Nathan. Coulson took Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons and Antoine Triplett to search for Daniels. When Coulson and his team encountered Daniels in the park, he revealed to them that S.H.I.E.L.D had made him stronger. They realized that Daniels would not stop until he got Audrey. The team convinced a reluctant Coulson to use Audrey to draw Daniels out so that they could subdue him with concentrated light powered by the Gamma Power Reserve. The plan was successful and Daniels was killed. On their way back from Portland, Coulson decided to forgive Melinda May for keeping secrets. He realized that he would not be able to accept forgiveness from Audrey (for hiding from her after his resurrection) until he was willing to forgive others. When the team returned to Providence, however, they found the base empty. May, Eric Koenig, Skye, and Grant Ward were gone.

The Shield That Protects
Coulson informs Maria Hill of Ward's betrayal
As the others who returned with him from Portland tried to get their bearings, Coulson repeatedly watched Providence's security footage in hopes of learning what happened to his missing team members. When Jemma Simmons found Eric Koenig's body and Leo Fitz found a message from Skye saying, "Ward is HYDRA," they knew Skye was in trouble and needed their help. Colonel Glenn Talbot found them with help from Maria Hill. 

Coulson and Skye fall out of the sky sitting in Lola
After Coulson explained to her the situation, Hill assisted Coulson's Team in escaping from Providence to Los Angeles and acted as a distraction so Coulson could board the Bus, where Skye and Ward were located. Unknown to Coulson, Deathlok was also on board. As the Bus ascended and Deathlok and Ward attacked, Coulson rescued Skye using Lola. They landed outside a hotel, where the team and Melinda May, who had returned, met to rest.

Before he could rest, May gave Coulson the information he wanted: who had led Project T.A.H.I.T.I.. Surprisingly, it was Coulson himself who had led the project, before resigning and asking Nick Fury not to use it.

Hunt for John Garrett
Coulson and May go undercover at Cybertek
The next morning, Coulson met with his team to make plans to stop John Garrett and retrieve the Bus. Coulson decided that he and Melinda May should go undercover as unemployed S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists seeking work atCybertek in order to obtain information on Deathlok, in the hopes it would lead them to Garrett. Coulson learned that John Garrett was "patient zero," the first Deathlok. Eventually, Coulson's team found the Barbershop Headquarters in Havana, Cuba Garrett was using. When they entered, they were surrounded by Centipede Soldiers and Kaminsky with the Berserker Staff.

Battle at Cybertek
Coulson uses the Destroyer Gun
Coulson and his team fought their way out, after Skye hacked the Barbershop Headquarters' computers. They decided to take the fight to John Garrett using a tracker Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons had planted on the Bus.

Coulson with Director Nick Fury
After landing at the Cybertek Manufacturing Facility in New Mexico, Coulson and Antoine Triplett created a diversion and stole a heavily armed armored Humvee and stormed the facility. Inside, Coulson confronted Garrett and Deathlok. After being thrown around by Garrett in a fight, Coulson was joined by Director Nick Fury, who gave him the Destroyer Armor Gun. Coulson and Fury took out the other Centipede Soldiers then confronted Garrett, as Deathlok targeted them. However, Deathlok turned on Garrett. Garrett tried to convince Coulson to call off Deathlok, but Coulson and Fury left the decision to Deathlok.

Coulson killing John Garrett
Coulson oversaw the taking of the Centipede soldiers and Grant Ward into custody by United States Armed Forces. However, Garrett survived and tried to use the Cybertek machines to heal himself. Coulson destroyed Garrett using the Peruvian 0-8-4.

Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
The New Beginning
Nick Fury tells Coulson to rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D.
Onboard the Bus, Coulson and Melinda May spoke to Nick Fury about Project T.A.H.I.T.I.. They asked why he used it on Coulson after Coulson's recommendation to terminate the project. Fury told him that he wanted Coulson alive because he was one of his most trusted agents. Coulson was touched but asked why Fury would take that risk, since the project had been designed to resurrect an Avenger. Fury responded that Coulson, due to his great heroics and leadership capability, was considered an Avenger. After telling Coulson that, May believed he was okay and fit for duty. Fury named Coulson as director and gave him the Toolbox with the task of rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D., then Fury disappeared.

Coulson and his team at the Playground
Within the box was a map that led Coulson and his team to the Playground, where Jemma Simmons was waiting for them. After they hugged, she assured them that Leo Fitz was alive, although she did not comment on his mental health. They were then greeted by the Playground's guardian, Billy Koenig, who looked exactly like his late brother, Eric Koenig. Koenig welcomed them and assured them that whatever resources they had at the base were Coulson's to use as he deemed fit. The team then prepared to begin Nick Fury's mission of rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D.. Later that night, Coulson awoke from bad dreams and began writing in a symbolic language.

Rebuilding the Agency
Skye and Coulson at the Playground
Despite all odds, Coulson began slowly rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D., with his old team serving as the core around which he assembled more agents. For three months, Coulson sat outside the cell of Grant Ward, but Ward refused to speak to him. Ward said he would only speak to Skye. Meanwhile Coulson recruited Isabelle Hartley, Idaho, and Lance Hunter. He gave Skye an assignment to study the Words of Creation, and he consulted with Andrew Garner about his urge to write in the cryptic symbol language. He didn't tell anyone about the meetings, not even Melinda May, Garner's ex-wife.  He sent two agents to infiltrate HYDRA, Jemma Simmons as a scientist for HYDRA, and Bobbi Morse to watch her back. To maintain her cover more easily, Coulson did not tell Simmons about Agent Morse or her mission. Morse eventually became the Head of Security at HYDRA Laboratories.

Coulson and Sam Koenig discuss Theta Protocol
A month later, Coulson informed Melinda May that he was heading to London to recruit more former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents into their organization. In reality he met with Sam Koenig in America to discuss Theta Protocol. Koenig informed Coulson that Jemma Simmons was doing well undercover at HYDRA and that Robert Gonzales had not been located and had likely been assassinated by HYDRA. Koenig asked Coulson how Leo Fitz was doing, and Coulson told him there had been some progress with his mental state. Koenig handed Coulson his new lanyard before looking over Theta Protocol, which was the repair and storing of Helicarrier No. 64 so that it could be ready to be used in case of a world-endangering emergency.

Coulson goes through the S.H.I.E.L.D. archive to learn about the Obelisk
Upon returning to the Playground, Coulson sent a team consisting of Hartley and Hunter to buy an 0-8-4 from a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, Roger Browning. The operation failed because Browning did not bring an 0-8-4 but instead brought a file on it. That file was stolen by an unknown assassin who killed Browning and escaped. Later, at the Playground, after receiving information about the assassin's identity, Coulson ordered Skye to talk to Grant Ward to get intelligence about the assassin.

Coulson then sent Hartley, Skye, and Melinda May to kidnap Glenn Talbot so they could talk. Talbot refused to cooperate, so Coulson tricked him into relinquishing his fingerprints and codes to the Government Storage Warehouse holding the Obelisk, the first 0-8-4.

All of Coulson's field agents went undercover to the storage facility. Hartley found the artifact, but, to defend herself against the Absorbing Man, she touched it. Coulson was called for instructions since Hartley was fatally injured. He ordered them to proceed. Only May knew that it was a two-pronged mission. The second part was to obtain a Quinjet with cloaking technology, since Leo Fitz's brain damage made him incapable of duplicating the technology for the Bus.

Tracking Carl Creel
Coulson talks with Raina
May went after Carl Creel. Coulson ordered her not to engage, despite Creel having killed Hartley and Idaho. May felt guilty when Creel killed a waitress who accidentally touched his Obelisk-infected skin. She told Coulson that she should have stopped Creel as she planned. Coulson said May would have died also and claimed that Hartley's and Idaho's deaths were his responsibility, despite May's reassurance they weren't.

Coulson questions Lance Hunter
At the Playground, as Coulson and the field agents tried to find a way to stop Creel, the group was contacted by Raina. She revealed the Obelisk had a tracker installed in it. Lance Hunter then arrived, having seemingly escaped from General Glenn Talbot. At his debriefing, Coulson asked Hunter what Talbot had offered him to get him sell out S.H.I.E.L.D.. Hunter was initially furious that Coulson had not sent out a team to stop and kill Carl Creel. Eventually he confessed, telling Coulson that Talbot had offered him two million dollars and a proper burial for Hartley, but he assured Coulson that he had declined the offer.

Coulson after turning Carl Creel to stone
When the team finally tracked down Creel, Coulson ordered Hunter to stay at the base, but after Hunter begged him, Coulson allowed him to accompany the others. As Skye, May, and Antoine Triplett got prepared, Coulson ordered the team to wait until Creel revealed his HYDRA contact before engaging. Hunter, however, wanting revenge, knocked out Skye, Triplett, and May with an I.C.E.R. and attempted to kill Creel himself. Fortunately Coulson arrived with the Overkill Device, which had been modified by Fitz and Alphonso Mackenzie. He stabbed Creel in the back, causing the Obelisk to turn his body to stone, incapacitating him.

Coulson recruits Lance Hunter
Coulson gave Hartley a proper burial service, receiving Hunter's gratitude. Coulson then convinced Hunter to join S.H.I.E.L.D. full time. He said he needed agents to do the right thing for the wrong reasons. Hunter agreed and Coulson ordered him to rat him out to Talbot. At the Playground, May berated Coulson for going into the field like he did and told him she knew that he was resisting his urges to write the Words of Creation. Coulson was tired of fighting the urge and began writing it while May recorded.

Coulson attempts to negotiate with General Glenn Talbot
Later, Coulson met Talbot and dropped Creel off to him, telling him to lock him up more securely this time. He promised to drop off "gifts" like that from time to time, so Talbot could keep getting promoted.  Coulson asked for a favor in return: for Talbot to give S.H.I.E.L.D. breathing room. Talbot openly refused, but before he could order his men to capture Coulson, the team arrived with the now cloaked Bus. They warned Talbot not to get any ideas. 



The Race Against Time
Coulson debriefs his agents about Donnie Gill and the threat he represents
Coulson attempted to make contact with Agent 33, but discovered she had been kidnapped by HYDRA. Upon returning to the base, he informed Agent May about the situation. Coulson then went to have dinner with Jemma Simmons, his mole in HYDRA. As they ate, they discussed Donnie Gill and the fact that HYDRA had a file on him. When Simmons asked about Leo Fitz, Coulson told her that he was fine. Coulson took the intel Simmons gave and prepped his field agents for their mission without revealing Simmons' part.

When Gill revealed himself in Casablanca on the Maribel del Mar, Coulson accompanied the others in the cloaked Bus, desiring that Gill become an asset for S.H.I.E.L.D. When he learned that Gill was brainwashed into taking the Sandbox for HYDRA, Coulson ordered that no HYDRA agent was to communicate with him. This order caused Lance Hunter to almost kill Simmons, but she was saved by Melinda May, who was ordered to maintain Simmons' cover.

After the mission in Morocco, Coulson confronted Fitz about torturing Ward. Coulson spoke about being director and the secrets he kept, including keeping Grant Ward in the basement.

Search for Creation
Coulson and May dance together
Later, Coulson and the team planned the retrieval of a painting which had mysteriously survived a fire unharmed and also had the Words of Creation carved on its back. Thanks to the assistance of Hunter and Skye, Coulson and May were able to infiltrate the party where the painting was the main attraction. During their mission the team discovered Glenn Talbot was also there and had taken the painting. Strangely, Talbot made a deal with them to examine the painting as long as they were in a secure location.

Agent 33 disguised as Melinda May fighting Coulson
May, wanting to make sure Talbot was telling the truth, tailed him, only to be subdued by Agent 33 and Sunil Bakshi. Agent 33, disguised as May, took May's place and lied to Coulson, claiming Talbot was telling the truth. As Coulson and 33 arrived at the location, Coulson discovered her deception when he mentioned them going to get a cup of coffee, a drink May hated. As the real May battled Agent 33, Coulson pursued and knocked out Bakshi and retrieved the painting.

Afterwards, Coulson told May that he wanted her to kill him if he were to go insane because of the GH.325.

Search for Skye's Father
Coulson tells Skye about his mental state
Later, the team was contacted by Raina who wanted to meet up with Coulson. At a restaurant, Coulson met Raina while Hunter, May, and Skye watched from a distance. During the conversation, Raina admitted she knew Skye's father, and threatened to blow Simmons' cover if Coulson did not release Skye to her custody. Coulson, having a back-up plan, refused the deal. Turning the tables on Raina, Coulson got her to admit where Skye's father was and had her agree to draw out Daniel Whitehall in exchange for protection. Skye beat the team to the location and found it empty, except for two dead men who had been killed by her father. Skye, horrified, called her father a monster. Back at the Playground, Hunter met his ex-wife, Bobbi Morse. Shocked and surprised to see her and her dyed hair, he asked Coulson what she was doing there. Coulson told Hunter to "play nice".

In his office, Coulson tried to apologize to Skye. He revealed that he had been writing the Words of Creation under May's watch. Coulson was upset that the symbols were incomprehensible to him. Skye said that they were a map.

Cleaning S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Reputation
Coulson and Skye watching the debate
Daniel Whitehall hired Marcus Scarlotti and his mercenaries to pose as S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and attack the United Nations as Glenn Talbot gave a speech there. Director Coulson sent Bobbi Morse, Lance Hunter, and Melinda May to Japan to follow a lead on Scarlotti's weapon, while he had Agent Noelle Walters put her team on standby until he learned more information.

He watched Senator Christian Ward, brother of Grant Ward, have a televised debate with Julien Beckers. Senator Ward denounced S.H.I.E.L.D. and proposed the eradication of the organization. Understanding the long term implications this would have on agents around the world, Coulson asked Skye to postpone researching the Words of Creation and talk to Grant about his brother. Coulson activated the Inertial Confinement Laser Barrier to interrupt their conversation when it strayed into discussing Skye's father.

Coulson in Senator Ward's office
Coulson went and talked to Senator Ward personally to ask him to recant his position. He agreed to do so if Grant was relinquished to him. Coulson then allowed Skye to learn all Grant knew about her mother and father before having him turned over. Senator Ward then kept his word. He publicly stated that S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA were separate organizations, one dedicated to law enforcement, the other bent on world domination.

Coulson learned that Scarlotti was seeking Beckers, so he told Walters' team to find and protect him. Coulson did not know that Beckers was a HYDRA agent. Consequently, Beckers and her team were slaughtered. When May called Coulson to inform him that the HYDRA agents were in custody, he was more concerned about the loss of his agents. Later, Coulson and a team of agents delivered Grant Ward to the FBI. Ward escaped shortly thereafter.

Solving the Mystery
Coulson looks at the symbols he drew
Coulson was once again drawing the symbols when Skye walked in and told him that despite all her leads, she could not find out where the supposed map led. Coulson told her that his compulsion to draw the symbols was increasing to the point where he could not stop. When Skye asked him what to do if they could not find the answer, Coulson changed the subject. He wondered about the progress Melinda May and the other agents were making on finding Grant Ward, so he contacted them. Agent Antoine Triplett informed Coulson about finding Ward at a Philadelphia bus station with a large number of explosives attached to him. Coulson told Triplett to continue following Ward but not to engage him.

Later, Skye told Coulson that a contact of hers, who was a "crime scene junkie", informed her of the murder of Janice Robbins, a woman who had the same mysterious symbols carved into her skin. When Coulson saw her picture he said Robbins was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. At the crime scene, Coulson and Skye found out that Robbins was putting the symbols in her artwork. Back at the Playground, Coulson noticed that her artwork had more symbols than Coulson's carvings.

Skye, Coulson, and Simmons
Skye found out that Janice Robbins' original name was Rebecca Stevens. She had been a S.H.I.E.L.D. level 6 agent in the past and had worked at the Triskelion, but had contracted cancer and died five years ago. Wanting to find out how that was possible, Coulson had Alphonso Mackenzie and Leo Fitz retrieve Stevens' body. After the autopsy, Jemma Simmons revealed that Stevens had the same GH.325 serum in her as Coulson and Skye. Coulson blamed himself for Stevens' death as he was in charge of Project T.A.H.I.T.I. Wanting to save others like Stevens, Coulson went into the Theta Brain-Wave Frequency Machine where he found out that Stevens and numerous others suffering from deadly diseases were administered the serum. As Coulson went as deep as he could, Skye contacted May and told her of Coulson's use of the machine. May ordered them to get him out of it.

Coulson threatens Hank Thompson
After a struggle, Skye managed to snap Coulson back to reality by holding him at gunpoint. She told him that May said he should be locked up for awhile. Coulson agreed, and, as the two went down to Vault D, Coulson told her that Sebastian Derik was the murderer and he was going after Hank Thompson.

Skye said she would send some agents to Thompson's location to protect him. Coulson said that would be unnecessary. He pushed Skye into the cell and trapped her, telling her he had to finish this on his own. Coulson arrived at Thompson's house and asked him at gunpoint if he was drawing the symbols in any shape or form. Thompson denied ever seeing them. He indirectly revealed that Derik had beat Coulson there. At that point, Derik knocked Coulson out.

Coulson after fighting Sebastian Derik
Derik tied up Coulson and Thompson. He reveled that despite having his memories erased, the pain from carving the symbols into his skin helped him to retrieve those memories. He said he carved the symbols into the other patients to help them to remember, too. While Derik was threatening to carve the symbols into Coulson, Thompson, having remembered some of his S.H.I.E.L.D. training, managed to free himself and his family. Derik saw that he was free, and threw his knife at him. Thompson caught the knife and freed Coulson.

Coulson and the blueprints of the mysterious city
Coulson and Derik dueled and Coulson nearly choked Derik, trying to get him to look down at Thompson's workshop. Skye and Mackenzie arrived and made Coulson release Derik. Coulson eventually managed to show Mackenzie what he had discovered: Thompson's model train city, when viewed from above, looked just like the mysterious symbols. 

Derik was turned over to the authorities. Back at the Playground, Coulson asked Thompson to rejoin S.H.I.E.L.D., but he refused, choosing to live a simple life. After Thompson departed, Coulson revealed to the others that his compulsion to draw the symbols was gone, having finally discovered what they were. Coulson gave his senior agents a new mission: find the city that matched the Words of Creation before HYDRA did.

The Hunt for Grant Ward
Meanwhile, Coulson gave Skye the assignment of downloading the phone of Sunil Bakshi, who was captured in Boston and held in Vault D.

He put Melinda May in charge of the Playground while he took Skye, Antoine Triplett, and Leo Fitz with him to Hawaii. May told him that Christian Ward wanted his people to find Grant, so Coulson allowed it.

Search for the Kree City
Coulson meets Calvin Zabo
In Oahu, Coulson realized that the Kaena Point Air Force Base was too difficult for them to infiltrate. A satellite relay station in Laura Creek, Australia, would be an easier target. That station went online as a backup for the Hawaiian facility when it was down. Coulson ordered an EMP to be set up that would disable the Oahu station for six minutes. When Coulson's team entered the Australian facility, they were ambushed by HYDRA.

Coulson discovers the location of the alien city
Pretending to be a captive, Calvin Zabo (Skye's father) offered to help save Triplett when he was shot. Coulson realized who he was, but he had to allow his escape in order to save Triplett. Coulson promised Zabo that they would finish their conversation. When Coulson arrived back at the Bus, he was clearly shaken by the experience. Before he and Fitz could tell Skye that they had seen her father, the satellites found the Kree City.

Locating the Kree City
After having located the Kree city, Coulson and the others briefed the agents on the plan to stop HYDRA from using the Diviner to kill hundreds of people. The plan was to send  a survey team into the city through an opening in San Juan, locate the temple, and then blow it up. Bobbi Morse asked about the Obelisk, since, even without the temple, the weapon was still dangerous. Coulson reassured her that when it got to that moment, they would deal with it.

Coulson speaks to Billy Koenig
Later, Sam and Billy Koenig saved Raina from being captured by Agent 33. Coulson learned from Billy that Agent 33 was still alive and that HYDRA was trying to capture Raina rather than kill her. Coulson told Billy he would be sending Melinda May with an extraction team to help them safely transport Raina. Coulson went to Skye and May as they watched news on the death of Senator Christian Ward and told them they would be splitting up the teams since HYDRA had finally located Raina. Coulson told Skye that she would be aiding in the interrogation of Raina, claiming that Raina would probably respond better to her. Coulson told May that he did not want Skye on the city mission because he did not want her to encounter her father and told May to keep an eye on her.

Coulson and Agent Bobbi Morse in San Juan
Coulson and Morse searched for the entrance to the Kree City in Puerto Rico. While they searched, Coulson reassured Morse that he had no intention of keeping the Diviner, as he was fighting for the lives of ordinary people. Morse met with her contact, who was unwilling to help them get down to the garrison, because he was scared of the legend that the place was haunted and that those who entered did not return.

Coulson, Mackenzie and Morse in Castillo San Cristóbal
Inside, Coulson watched as the D.W.A.R.F.s were sent down a hundred foot shaft leading to the hidden underground city. Then the drones lost their signal, though the tablet control still worked. Alphonso Mackenzie was sent down to investigate. When Coulson heard his screams, Mackenzie was hoisted back up. Mackenzie then slapped Coulson into a wall as his eyes turned red.

As the team attempted to subdue him, Morse ended up electrocuting him with her staves, causing Mackenzie to fall back down into the hole. Coulson ordered them to seal the shaft. Morse yelled that Mackenzie was still down there. Coulson told her that Mackenzie was no longer himself.

Stopping HYDRA
Coulson speaks to Bobbi Morse
Melinda May went to San Juan to inform Coulson, Fitz, Morse and Simmons that Grant Ward had taken Skye and Raina. Coulson surmised that Ward was probably taking Skye to meet her father. Coulson told Bobbi Morse to make sure Diego did not reveal anything to HYDRA and told her that they would do everything they could to help Alphonso Mackenzie, but they had to stop HYDRA from entering the city first.

Coulson speaks to Sam Koenig
May blamed herself for letting Ward take Skye. Coulson assured her that Skye would be fine, since May had turned her into a capable agent who could handle herself. As the team prepared, Coulson told Sam Koenig to report back to the Playground. He said if things went south, he would need Sam and his brother to enact the Theta Protocol. Coulson received a call from Morse who told him that HYDRA forces were in Puerto Rico in the old abandoned Ponce de León Theater‏.

Coulson kills Daniel Whitehall
Coulson and May went to help Morse and Hunter stop HYDRA. Together all four stormed the theater. Coulson killed Daniel Whitehall as the latter was about to shoot Skye's father, Calvin Zabo. Angered that he lost his chance for vengeance, Zabo attacked Coulson and nearly beat him to death. He was stopped by Skye who held him at gunpoint and told him to leave. Skye apologized to Coulson and told him she was going destroy the Diviner and stop HYDRA's plan.

Coulson goes to save Skye
Chasing after her, Coulson met up with May again and had her lower him down into the city so he could save Skye. Inside, Coulson was attacked by Alphonso Mackenzie, whom he briefly managed to subdue. With Skye inside the chamber and no one else around, Coulson was again confronted by Mackenzie. Fortunately, Mackenzie returned to normal once the Diviner was activated. Helping Mackenzie to his feet, the two watched as the city began to crumble.

The Director's Duties
Coulson swears to destroy HYDRA
Coulson, not being able to sleep, observed Skye as she slept in quarantine. When she awakened, they talked about how the death of Antoine Triplett was affecting the other senior agents in the Playground. Coulson told Skye, who blamed herself, that HYDRA was going to pay for his death.

Coulson argues with Alphonso Mackenzie
Coulson called a meeting of his senior agents to discuss with them his plans for Sunil Bakshi. During the conversation, Alphonso Mackenzie, who was still suffering from the effects of going down into the Kree Temple, challenged Coulson's authority, believing his plan unsound. An argument ensued among the agents until Coulson had enough and told everyone, especially Mackenzie, that Triplett had known his place and would not have hesitated to obey Coulson's orders. Coulson then dismissed everyone.

Talking to Glenn Talbot
The next morning, Coulson made a deal with General Glenn Talbot to give him Sunil Bakshi, who had now recovered from his suicide attempt, in exchange for Talbot's assistance in handling any remaining HYDRA forces. Coulson and Melinda May were transferring Bakshi to the custody of General Talbot when the S.H.I.E.L.D. SUV he was in was hit by a truck filled with mercenaries. Coulson and May were seemingly both fatally shot in the ensuing gunfight and one of the mercenaries escaped with Bakshi after a firefight. This was a ruse to have Bakshi lead S.H.I.E.L.D. to the new leader of HYDRA, since Daniel Whitehall was dead.

Coulson comforts Antoine Triplett's mother
Coulson's plan was successful and, using Bakshi as bait, they were able to trick HYDRA into assassinating three of their own leaders before recapturing Bakshi and delivering him to Talbot. Back at the Playground, Coulson listened as Mackenzie apologized and asked to work on Lola. Coulson asked if the miniature version that he had in his office could fly and Mackenzie told him that it could not. Coulson then left and returned the Howling Commando Gear to Mrs. Triplett and informed her of the death of her son Antoine. As she began to cry, Coulson hugged her and looked at a photograph of the Howling Commandos. Later, Coulson secretly sent Mike Peterson to search for Dr. List, one of the few remaining heads of HYDRA.

Aliens
Lady Sif and Phil Coulson on the Bus
Coulson was having a conversation with Alphonso Mackenzie about him becoming a field agent when Melinda May informed them about a situation in Portugal. Once the team arrived in Faro, they found Lady Sif who did not recognize them and could not remember why was she on Earth. As they investigated, Skye found an online video of Sif fighting an unknown man. Back on the Bus, they discovered the stranger was wounded by Sif and that his "blood" was blue. At the site of the battle, Sif still could not remember anything but Coulson deduced that she was working undercover because she was wearing Earth clothes instead of her Asgardian armor.

Coulson, Sif and Melinda May continue their investigation
Coulson spoke with one witness, Mr. Cardozo. He told Coulson that the stranger Sif had fought took helium from the balloons on the boardwalk. Bobbi Morse then called and informed Coulson about a possible lead in the local hospital. Morse and Skye were sent to investigate. There they were attacked by the stranger, who managed to knock down Morse and escape. Back on the Bus, when Skye mentioned that the stranger might be Kree, Sif realized that "Kava", which she was seeking, was not a person, but the Kree word for keys. They realized Kava was actually Chaves, the city in Portugal where the HYDRA leader Daniel Whitehall discovered the Obelisk in 1945. The agents then ambushed the Kree and captured him.

Coulson protects Skye
When Coulson and Sif interrogated the Kree, he introduced himself as Vin-Tak and said he would earn their trust. Back in the Playground, Vin-Tak took his Truncheon from Coulson and touched Sif with it, restoring her memories. Vin-Tak then told them about the Diviners and the Inhumans. When they asked Skye about what she saw in the Kree City beneath Puerto Rico, the building started shaking. Coulson asked Skye what was causing that, and she said it was her.

Sif then wanted to take Skye to Asgard, but Coulson would not let her. As May told Skye to run, Coulson tried to stop Sif and Vin-Tak, but Vin-Tak attacked him and threw him across the room.

Coulson says goodbye to Lady Sif
May then took Skye to Vault D where Sif soon found them. Coulson arrived just in time to see Skye shooting herself with an I.C.E.R., which finally convinced Sif she would sooner hurt herself than anyone else. Sif then took Vin-Tak, who had lost his memory after a fight with Bobbi Morse, back to his home planet. Before she departed, she warned Coulson that the incoming threats could be more than he could handle.

Vengeful Father
Coulson talks with Skye
Coulson visited Skye in the interrogation cell on the Bus, where she was moved after the violent display of her powers. Coulson told her that they put her name on the Index. Later, Coulson had a conversation with Agent May and they decided to call May's ex-husband, Dr. Andrew Garner, a psychologist who specialized in working with gifted individuals from the Index.

Coulson explores the Brynmore Psychiatric Facility
Later, after welcoming Garner into the Playground, Coulson was called by Agent Royce who informed him about the break in at the Brynmore Psychiatric Facility. Coulson talked with Agent Morse about the break in and asked her about Agent Hunter's apparent disappearance. Morse replied that a permanent job in S.H.I.E.L.D. was not something Hunter would take. Once they arrived at the facility, Coulson and Morse discovered the attackers were led by Calvin Zabo. In the facility's secret sub-basement, Coulson and Morse were attacked by John Bruno, a former government assassin, but Morse easily overpowered him. The other individual they sought, David Angar, was missing. Back on their plane, Coulson used traffic cameras to search for the license plate on Zabo's RV.

Coulson and Morse prepare to fight the Slicing Talons

Once he realized what Zabo was planning, Coulson and Morse went to Manitowoc, Coulson's home town. At the Manitowoc High School, Coulson and Morse discovered that Angar had rendered an entire field of students unconscious for Zabo to hold hostage. Coulson surrendered to Zabo, who declared that he was planning on exposing S.H.I.E.L.D. for their "barbaric" inhibitions of gifted individuals before it could do the same thing to his daughter. Coulson replied that it was to stop criminals, not cheerleaders. 
Coulson witnesses Skye using her powers
Suddenly, Agent May turned up with a gun to Skye's head, threatening to kill her if Zabo did not surrender. Zabo called her bluff and admitted that no one in town was even listening to him; he passed the microphone to Angar so his voice would affect all of Manitowoc. Suddenly, a mysterious man appeared on the field and teleported Zabo away. Coulson, May, and Morse then quickly defeated the remaining members of the Slicing Talons, but Skye suddenly unintentionally generated an earthquake and fell unconscious. Later, in the Playground, Jemma Simmons told Coulson that whatever powers Skye and Raina had were already inside them, and not artificially created like the powers of Angar or Michael Peterson.

Tough Choices
Coulson talks with Agent May about Skye
In his office, Coulson talked with Melinda May about what to do with Skye. Though May agreed with Andrew Garner's suggestion that Skye should be removed from active S.H.I.E.L.D. duty, Coulson hesitated. 

Coulson at the Retreat
He eventually decided to take Skye to Nick Fury's cabin, which was designed as a safe house for people with powers. He told her that he had to pull her from active duty. Before he departed, Coulson gave Skye the gloves Simmons had made to dampen her powers. He advised her to try to learn how to control her powers. 

Back at the Playground, Leo Fitz asked Coulson where Skye was and he replied that that information was confidential, but that she was safe. In his office, Coulson and May had a video conversation with General Glenn Talbot who informed them that Agent 33 and Grant Ward had broken into his base to liberate Sunil Bakshi. After the conversation with Talbot, Coulson and May agreed that Alphonso Mackenzie was hiding something, and that they should find out what.

S.H.I.E.L.D. Civil War
Attacked
Coulson and Mack work on Lola
While Alphonso Mackenzie was looking under Lola's hood, Coulson confronted him about the extra component he put in the model of Lola in his office, revealing that he knew about Mack hiding something. When he asked him about his loyalty, Mack replied that he was only loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson then ordered three agents to point their guns at Mackenzie. Suddenly, an EMP burst through the base, shutting down all the electronic equipment and Mackenzie used the opportunity to escape. Coulson and his agents ran into Leo Fitz, who was immediately sent to turn the power back on. Coulson and Melinda May continued the search for Mackenzie and Bobbi Morse, who had attacked May a few minutes earlier while claiming to work for "the real S.H.I.E.L.D." Jemma Simmons called Coulson and informed him about taking down Morse, then an unidentified gas began pumping through the Playground's vents, knocking out Coulson and all of his agents.

Coulson is questioned by Robert Gonzales
When Coulson awakened, the base was controlled by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents led by Robert Gonzales. Coulson had not heard anything about Gonzales since the revelation of HYDRA's existence. Coulson and Gonzales then talked in Coulson's office about Coulson's and Nick Fury's abilities as director. Gonzales tried to convince Coulson his own way of leading S.H.I.E.L.D. as the right one. Coulson refused to open the Toolbox for Gonzales, who gave it to one of his agents to give to Anne Weaver. Suddenly, Melinda May entered the office, knocking out Gonzales and two of his agents with an I.C.E.R. Coulson then escaped from the base via the secret elevator while May stayed behind and surrendered to Gonzales' agents.

Later, Coulson came in contact with Lance Hunter, who had managed to escape from Gonzales' headquarters aboard the aircraft carrier Iliad. Hunter accepted Coulson's offer to be a full-time S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, and Coulson told him that he planned to retake S.H.I.E.L.D. from Gonzales.

Deathlok Reinforcement
Coulson and Hunter steal a car
Stealing a Jeep from Honest Eddie's Car Dealership, Coulson and Lance Hunter went to the Retreat, where they found video footage of Skye using her powers to cause a massive shockwave, throwing back two of Gonzales' agents. During that time, Hunter offered Coulson a drink, taking out two glasses, one for himself and the other for "the person keeping me warm". He jokingly stated that he would make an exception in Coulson's case. Coulson told him that he needed to keep his head clear.

Coulson and Hunter shoot Gonzales' S.H.I.E.L.D. agents
While Hunter slept, Coulson made a decision to contact Mike Peterson before alerting Robert Gonzales about their location. The next morning Gonzales' S.H.I.E.L.D. agents arrived to arrest them both. Over Hunter's protests, Coulson told Gonzales that his plan was to steal one of their Quinjets. Coulson used his 21st Century Howling Commando Gear to create a hologram illusion, tricking the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, before stealing their uniforms. Before Coulson and Hunter could escape, however, they were caught by another team of Gonzales' agents and arrested. They were rescued by Mike Peterson, who attacked the guards and took out the agents.

Coulson tells Hunter they're going after Grant Ward
With the Quinjet now under their control, Hunter asked Coulson why he had not informed him that backup was a super-powered cyborg. Coulson told him that he wanted to see the look on Hunter's face. Coulson told Hunter that he had been using Peterson to track down HYDRA scientist, Dr. List. Coulson explained that his next step would be to find the only man who had a connection between S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA: Grant Ward.

Leo Fitz opened the Toolbox and contacted Coulson; Coulson and Lance Hunter decided to retrieve him.

Alliance with Grant Ward
Coulson has a meeting with Grant Ward
Coulson, Lance Hunter, and Deathlok took the Quinjet to retrieve Leo Fitz, then flew to find Grant Ward. Coulson confronted Agent 33 in a Tijuana diner, and used her phone to call Ward, telling Ward to meet him in the diner. When Ward arrived, Deathlok sent him to a booth where Coulson waited. Coulson offered Ward a deal. If Ward helped them, he could go through the Project T.A.H.I.T.I. protocol, getting his bad memories wiped. Ward eventually accepted the deal and left to get his things with Agent 33 and Deathlok.

Coulson with Deathlok
Ward explained he would use the recently brainwashed Sunil Bakshi to infiltrate HYDRA and gain a meeting with Dr. List who could bring them into contact with Baron Wolfgang von Strucker. While in flight, Coulson and Hunter were forced to restrain Fitz when Ward unintentionally provoked him. Fitz voiced his discontent with allying with Ward, believing he and Bakshi would betray them. Coulson assured him that he was sending in Deathlok as Bakshi's bodyguard so they could watch through his implant. Though Ward reminded Coulson that List only wanted Bakshi, Coulson was confident that Bakshi could talk his way out of trouble.

Coulson and Ward aim their guns at each other
As the meeting got underway, Bakshi went off-script and offered Deathlok to List for experimentation. Ward admitted that it was the only way to get close to Wolfgang von Strucker, resulting in a standoff on the Quinjet. When Fitz noticed that Deathlok was preparing to kill all HYDRA agents present, both parties lowered their weapons so Fitz could tell Deathlok to play along. Coulson's party then followed List's jet on its way to Strucker, but the HYDRA scientist made a stop in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Through Deathlok's Backscatter X-Ray Eye Implant, they learned that List was tracking down occurrences of quantum entanglements across the planet. Fitz realized they were trying to track the teleporter who took Skye. Coulson lied to Ward and Agent 33, saying he didn't know what HYDRA wanted with Skye.
