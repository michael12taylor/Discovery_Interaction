<html><p>Jigsaw demands that Lillian open the door
To Jigsaw's surprise however, Lillian had remained defiant despite a gun being pointed at her and refused to open the door, claiming that it was on the timer and could not be opened. Jigsaw soon became angered at Lillian's refusal, insisting that she was lying to him and threatening to kill her if she continued to refuse his instructions as he banged his gun on the protective glass. However, Lillian told Jigsaw about how her father fought in World War II before building the bank up from nothing, telling him that she would not allow it to be robbed by any thugs like them out of her great respect for her late father.

Jigsaw threatens Lillian with a grenade
Jigsaw eventually became tired of Lillian's continued defiance and then made the decision to threatened everybody inside the bank by pulling out a live grenade which he had stolen from the United States Armed Forces, as this resulted in Anton Reed begging Lillian to now reconsider her decision, although she refused despite Reed noting that everything was insured. Looking her in the eye, Jigsaw claimed that Lillian was becoming erratic in her behavior, as Bobby agreed that she was crazy before Jigsaw promised that after he counted to three he would drop the grenade in with Lillian and kill them all.

Jigsaw preparing to leave with the money
Since Lillian still would not open up their door, claiming the grenade would not fit through the slot, Reed then pushed past her and finally unlocked the door despite her protests, allowing Jigsaw, Bobby and Mike to finally get inside. Jigsaw then tied up the remaining hostages until the money was collected. As he prepared to go, Jigsaw thanked everyone, calling Lillian crazy before telling the others to thank Reed for saving their lives. Knowing that Reed was actually an inside man working for them, Jigsaw had then mocked a hostage kidnapping as he demanded that Reed also come with them before leaving.

Return of the Punisher
Jigsaw witnesses the return of Frank Castle
As Jigsaw and his crew exited ReadyQuick Check Cashing together with Anton Reed acting as their hostage, they attempted to get the stolen money into the escape cars that were waiting for them without causing too much of a scene. Looking out to the streets, Jigsaw then noticed someone wearing Jake Nelson's clothes and mask was now coming towards them, as Jigsaw just assumed this to be Nelson finally turning up to help and called out to him to come over, noting how he was extremely late for their robbery and wanting him to assist with their getaway.

Russo is stunned by the Punisher's arrival
However, to Jigsaw's horror, the man called him out by his name and removed his mask, revealing himself to be Frank Castle. As Jigsaw looked on, Castle revealed his Bulletproof Vest which had the white skull from Jigsaw's nightmares painted on the front. Jigsaw had then stood frozen in horror, ignoring his crew while they called out to him, while he realized that Castle was the one who had disfigured him, all the while with Todd and all the others engaging in a firefight against Castle, resulting in Mike taking a bullet to the head while Jigsaw still remained frozen in place due to his complete shock and horror.

Jigsaw realizes the Punisher is Frank Castle
With Geno also getting killed in the shootout, the Punisher was then forced into cover as Phillip began shooting at him with a sniper rifle, allowing José to run over to Jigsaw and pull him into their car so they could make their escape from the situation. As they drove away from the scene as fast as they could, Jigsaw was haunted by a flood of memories coming back to him, as he remembered how he friend had dragged his face across a broken mirror, which caused Jigsaw's permanently disfigured face, as Jigsaw's thoughts soon went from fear and sorrow to the furious desire to finally get his revenge.

Jigsaw readies himself to face the Punisher
Desiring a chance to kill his former friend, Jigsaw furiously demanded that José stop the car while he loaded his new machine gun, despite José insisted that he was crazy for wanting to get out of their car to confront the Punisher. Despite these objections, José had eventually stopped the car and Jigsaw stepped out into the streets, aiming his machine at the roads while he waited for the Punisher to come round the corner. With Phillip having been knocked out by Curtis Hoyle, the Punisher charged around the corner as Jigsaw furiously unloaded his hail of bullets at his car, causing him to crash while Jigsaw fired.

Jigsaw furiously calling out to the Punisher
As Jigsaw reloaded his gun, he furiously yelled out to the Punisher, as he also questioned if his friend had really been the person to have disfigured his face and caused him so much suffering as a result. In their standoff, the Punisher attempted to get out of the car, only for Jigsaw to continue shooting at him. With the Punisher taking cover behind the car and with the New York City Police Department now on their way to the scene of the shootout, Jigsaw had again questioned if his friend had really done all this to him, to which the Punisher then loudly confirmed that he had, while showing no remorse for Jigsaw's suffering as a result of his injuries, which had angered Jigsaw.

Jigsaw angrily shooting to kill the Punisher
Seeing the police were on their way, Jigsaw had then witnessed the Punisher get to his feet and try to shoot him, as Jigsaw responded by unleashing a hail of bullets at his former friend, screaming in rage as he fired the gun. As the police got closer, Jigsaw was then forced to turn his gunfire towards them, managing to inadvertently get out of Hoyle's line of sight. As Brett Mahoney and the other police officers began firing back at him in the middle of the New York City streets, Jigsaw refused to relent as his onslaught of gunfire had forced them to take cover as they were outgunned by Jigsaw's firepower.

Jigsaw sees the Punisher make his escape
At the moment Jigsaw took cover behind a car to reload his gun, he noticed that the Punisher was currently attempting to make a break for freedom. Seeing this, Jigsaw turned his attention away from the police force baring down on him and once again began firing on the Punisher, forcing him to dive behind two parked cars as he sought cover. Despite all the bullets being fired at him, however, the Punisher was still able to get to his feet and run to safety, with Mahoney then chasing after him, much to Jigsaw's frustration as he was left to fight off the police's gunfire as they were still trying to bring him down.

Jigsaw attempting to fire back at the NYPD
With the police now bearing down on him, Jigsaw had briefly found himself completely trapped with seemingly no possible way out other than being killed or captured, until Todd pulled up in the other escape car and began firing at the police while calling on Jigsaw to get into the car and escape. As he reloaded his gun once again, Jigsaw then began moving closer to his crew members while forcing the police to take cover as he fired down at them. Finally Bobby was able to grab hold of Jigsaw and immediately dragged him back in the car as they drove away towards safety, all while still shooting at the police.

Russo seeing the skull imagery in his head
All the surviving members of Jigsaw's Crew then returned back into their Hideout where a furiously Bobby had expressed his frustration over the entire situation, pointing the blame directly at Jigsaw. While the crew freed Anton Reed and discussed the heist in detail, Jigsaw then got out of the car and ignored Bobby's questions over why the Punisher had been there. As the others discussed the money, Jigsaw continued thinking about how his friend had destroyed his life, as he continued seeing the skull imagery from his nightmares and hearing the sounds of broken glass as well as his own horrific screaming.

Russo killing two people to silence his crew
Although Jigsaw stood in silence, José eventually asked his opinion, leading to Bobby furiously insulting him as he noted how Jigsaw had almost gotten them all arrested, while getting Mike and Geno killed, claiming that everything had gone wrong simply because Jigsaw lost control. Frustrated with the arguing, Reed had attempted to grab the money, as Jigsaw then drew his gun and immediately shot and killed both Reed and Bobby. Jigsaw then picked up the bag of money and threatened all the others by calmly questioning if they had a problem with his methods, before walking out with all the stolen money.

Return to Krista Dumont
Russo returning to Krista Dumont's home
With Russo freaked out over everything he had just learned and gone through in the last few hours, he was then forced to go back to Krista Dumont, hoping that she would be willing to help he figure everything out. Upon arriving, Russo began banging onto the door to Dumont's Apartment and begged her to let him inside, finding that Dumont was still wary of allowing him back in. Hearing her on the other side of the door, Russo continued pleading to be allowed inside until he had finally heard the door unlock.

Russo begs Krista Dumont to open the door
Dumont however, still did not fully open the door, keeping it onto the latch as Russo continued begging to be let in. Taking a moment to look into Russo's eyes, Dumont noted how she thought that Russo had gone for good, to which Russo noted how he had thought a lot of things and had suddenly realized that none of them were actually real. Getting serious, Dumont told Russo that he could not come and go from her life as he pleased, although Russo insisted that he did not have anywhere else to go if she did not agree to help him, as he noted that he was willing to beg if that was what she had wanted.

Russo panickingly recounts what happened
Although Dumont briefly closed the door which horrified Russo, she soon changed her mind, unlocking it and allowing Russo inside. As soon as Russo got inside, he began losing control as he continued panicking over everything that had happened, ignoring Dumont while she questioned where he had been and what was in the bag which he had brought with him, as Russo did not show her the money and insisted that none of that mattered before frantically revealing that he now knew that Frank Castle was the person who had brutally scarred his face, to which Dumont questioned if he meant his friend.

Russo asks why Frank Castle disfigured him
Still completely mortified by everything he had learned, Russo told Dumont about how Castle had tried to kill him, noting that the skull from his recent nightmares had actually been his broken memories of the Punisher's Vest. Losing control of his emotions, Russo noted how Castle had been hunting him ever since he escaped from the Sacred Saints Hospital and questioned why Castle would have disfigured his face in the first place. On the verge of tears, Russo explained how he could not understand why any of this had happened to him and that he could not feel like any of it was real as he fell down onto knees.

Russo tensely asks for Krista Dumont's help
Russo noted how Castle had once been his best friend in the Marine Corps, but now he had been pointing a gun at him, an image Russo simply could not understand due to his large gaps in his memories. As he cried on the floor, Russo was then comforted by Dumont who stepped over to him while Russo held onto her hand and apologized for everything that he had put her through by returning to her, noting that he did not know what else he could do and Dumont who now the only person who could possibly help him, something that Dumont smiled at as she then helped Russo into her home once again.

Therapy with Dr. Dumont
Russo recalls Frank Castle to Krista Dumont
Russo sat down with Krista Dumont as he attempted to understand how Frank Castle had been the one who had destroyed his life and disfigured his face, telling Dumont about his time serving alongside Castle while they were in the Marine Corps, claiming that he would have given his life for Castle and questioned why he would have ever tried to kill him, to which Dumont suggested that maybe Castle was never actually the king of man Russo had believed him to be.

Russo being told to breathe during therapy
Despite how much it still pained him, Russo suggested that his lack of memories meant that he was not really the good man he always believed himself to be. Dumont, however, noted that she had treated former soldiers with injuries half as bad as Russo who spent the rest of their lives lying in their beds, noting that what the Punisher did to Russo was unfair and cruel. Upon hearing this, Russo noted that his life had been better when he simply did not know how his face had become scarred, although Dumont insisted that he was wrong about that as she got onto her knees and held onto Russo's hand.

Russo and Krista Dumont discuss their pain
While Russo struggled to breathe, Dumont insisted that now he knew the truth about what happened to him, his nightmares would finally end and that there were no more missing pieces to the Jigsaw of his own mind. Dumont went on to note how Castle was the man Russo had trusted who had broken that trust and tried to destroy him, and this would allow Russo to understand his pain and work through it, promising that he could be reborn as a stronger man because of all of the pain he had suffered through as a result of what the Punisher had done to him, while promising to help him work through this.

Russo supporting Krista Dumont's choices
Dumont noted that she understood Russo's agony as she had gone through it all herself. Dumont went on to explain that she eventually came face to face with that thing that had hurt her and this allowed her to heal, comparing the feeling to touching god. Dumont had then passionately kissed Russo, claiming that while it did not feel like it, this was actually the best day of Russo's life. Russo, however, noted that he was still crazy and yet Dumont let him in any way, questioning why she would do that, to which she explained she had always hated beginnings and their relationship had started in the middle.

Late Night Breakdown
Russo watches Krista Dumont as she sleeps
Despite all of the help she offered, Russo had still found himself not trusting Krista Dumont as he sat by her side while she slept on the sofa. Upon waking up and and seeing him, Dumont offered to hold hands with Russo, who instead noted how he believed that she had almost tricked him, commenting that her letting him come back into her Apartment and trying to make him better was actually all a ploy by Dumont and that she had never actually cared about him at all, which had clearly unnerved Dumont.

Russo accusing Krista Dumont about lying
Russo claimed that Dumont had known that Frank Castle had been the one who had destroyed his life, believing that it had always been in his medical file and this was the secret everyone had been keeping from him. However, Dumont had insisted that Castle had never been mentioned in Russo's file, to which Russo theorized that she knew he would eventually read that so she had just hidden the real file and furiously demanded to know why she would do this, questioning if it was so that she could control him and instead play god with his own life, something which Dumont had calmly continued to deny.

Russo destroys Krista Dumont's belongings
Falling to his knees, Russo had commented that if he could no longer trust Castle, then he could not trust anybody as he questioned how Castle could possibly come to hate him so much. Upon seeing him breaking down, Dumont had attempted to make Russo find five blue thing in the room in order to focus his mind and help him calm down, however, Russo was too angry to think straight as he then grabbed a blue vase and smashed it onto the ground. Despite Dumont trying to get through to him, Russo had furiously destroyed several blue items across the Apartment while Dumont backed away in terror.

Russo hits the wall next to Krista Dumont
Turning his attention back toward the now terrified Dumont who was begging him to calm down, Russo had claimed that she was another person trying to destroy his life by lying to him and manipulating him, ignoring her pleas for him to stop before he then furiously punched through the wall right beside her. As the now crying Dumont backed away from him, Russo continued to follow her while destroying her possessions before opening up the curtains and forcing Dumont to look outside, knowing that Dumont's greatest fear was heights and this would be a terrifying experience for her to go through.

Russo forcing Krista Dumont to look outside
As Dumont cried, Russo had pressed her face against the glass and questioned how it felt to have something that she had hated and that scared her pushed up against her, comparing all this to how Dumont had pushed him to constantly feel the last thing that he ever wanted to feel, commenting that everybody wanted somebody else to feel worse then they already did, and that everybody gets betrayed in the end. Dumont finally made Russo stop his outburst when she told him that the scariest thing that he was feeling inside, was that it could be possible that Dumont actually felt some kind of love for him.

Russo being calmed down by Krista Dumont
Upon hearing this, Russo finally let Dumont go while she commented that she had also believed that Russo could change and became a better and stronger person. As Dumont continued, Russo sat on the floor while Dumont insisted that she would never hurt him and that she had never lied to him, promising that he was not a lesser version of himself, but a better version. Dumont noted that there was nothing left that could hurt Russo as he was still standing despite everything that had happened, telling him to chose to be stronger as she knew that it would not be easy as Russo began crying in her arms.

Seeking Revenge
Inspiring Jigsaw's Crew
Russo hands over all the money to his crew
Having calmed down from his previous outburst, Russo went to meet with the surviving members of his Crew on the outskirts of New York City, dropping all of the stolen money on the ground. Seeing that the crew were clearly tense about being around him again following the murders of Bobby and Anton Reed, Russo had reassured them that everything that they had stolen was there in the bag as he had not taken any of it, as he had then invited Todd to check the bag for the money, with Todd confirming that Russo was telling the truth.

Russo telling his crew to make more money
Despite this, Russo had then told the crew that everything they stole from ReadyQuick Check Cashing should be considered as nothing more than scraps, questioning if that was all that they wanted and if they all wanted to simply leave New York with this small amount of money and never return. Russo had then claimed that if they believed that they deserved more than what was lying front of them, then they were in the right place by staying within his crew, as Russo used the speech he gave his Anvil recruits as he questioned if they were ready to become a part of something that was bigger than themselves.

Russo giving his speech to inspire his crew
Russo had claimed that Bobby had not understood this concept and made the robbery all amount himself and his ego, which was why he had been executed, before asking José and Phillip to consider what they could achieve together. Knowing that he was winning them all back over to his side, Russo promised that he would allow them to leave if they simply wanted to take this money and run, suggesting that instead, they invest the money in a Base of Operation as well as weapons to continue their Campaign to fight back against the entire system that had already been holding them down for so long.

Russo convincing his crew to follow him
Russo finished by promising that they would find other United States Armed Forces veterans who would also be willing to join with them in exchange for a piece of what they would all be building. When José questioned exactly what Russo was talking about, Russo told them that he was talking about continuing what they had started on that day during their robbery but escalated, promising that they would be able to build an army, promising that this army would not be a gang, but a brotherhood, promising that if they could fight together as this brotherhood, they could eventually become as strong as gods.

Expanding their Operations
Jigsaw leading his crew during their raid
Using all the money they stole from their Robbery at the ReadyQuick Check Cashing, Jigsaw and the surviving members of his crew then invested everything that they had stolen in their new equipment and weaponry, including Bulletproof Vests and assault rifles, while also recruiting other United States Armed Forces veterans who were willing to join their mission. With precision and skill gained from their training from the military, their crew was able to attack drug dens and slaughter everybody inside with considerable ease, with Jigsaw also joining them on these missions and looking over the carnage.

Jigsaw goes to celebrate his crew's mission
With the New York City Police Department completely unable to stop them, Jigsaw's Crew celebrated easy victories as they brought their massive profits back to their new hideout of Valhalla, with Jigsaw still happily watching while José and the other gang members, who now had begun wearing similar masks to Jigsaw's Mask, expressed their enthusiasm at the situation. Once they got back to Valhalla, Jigsaw followed Phillip upstairs as they unloaded their bags of money, which came to at least half a million dollars stolen from criminal gangs, that allowed the crew to celebrate with a massive party at Valhalla.

Russo keeps an eye on Moke during a party
While Jigsaw hosted their party at Valhalla, he noticed that one of his men, Moke, had begun to get overenthusiastic with Lanie, who was trying to break free from his grip while Moke demanded that she give him more attention. Seeing this, Jigsaw furiously called out to Moke, which then caused the entire room to go silent out of respect for their leader. Jigsaw then demanded that Moke show some respect to their guests as he let Lanie walk away while Moke sat back down. Jigsaw then sat with Phillip and Todd, while keeping a close eye on Moke to ensure that he did not continue harassing any of their guests.

Russo talks while in bed with Krista Dumont
While his crew celebrated continued success with their moves to the world organized crime with their robberies, Russo had also continued his relationship with Krista Dumont, returning to her Apartment and engaging in their continued violent, but mutually pleasurable, sexual encounters with her. During their sexual encounters, Russo would pull at Dumont's hair and press his fingers into her scars on her legs and back, causing her both great pain and pleasure at the same time which she had enjoyed, while Dumont would then return the favor by biting down on Russo's lip while passionately kissing him.

Russo promises to deal with Frank Castle
As they lay in bed together, Russo and Dumont discussed the future, as Dumont then noted that the crusade of violence Russo was going through could not last forever and that they should begin to consider a future together, making it clear that she wanted to use the money Russo had stolen to leave New York City for good. However, Russo told Dumont that he needed to deal with the Punisher first, to which Dumont told Russo not to allow the Punisher to define who he was. Russo then looked Dumont directly into the eyes and told her that he needed to know why his former best friend wanted to kill him.

Confronting Dinah Madani
Russo entering Dinah Madani's apartment
Seeking answers on everything that he had forgotten, Russo went to the Apartment of Dinah Madani. Finding the apartment empty, Russo then began exploring the rooms, knowing that he and Madani had previously had a sexual relationship which he could not recall. Walking in the bedroom, Russo ran his fingers over Madani's bed and looked at her belongings, finding his Personal Journal which Madani had stolen from Sacred Saints Hospital following Russo's escape.

Russo reveals his presence to Dinah Madani
Eventually, Madani returned home as Russo stepped out of sight and then waited for her to put her gun on her bed and step back into the kitchen. Russo then took Madani's gun and finally revealed himself, questioning if Madani had had a tough day as he watched her pour a glass of whiskey for herself. Seeing him, Madani commented on the good work the doctors did on his face following his disfigurement, to which Russo questioned if Madani was disappointed by that. Russo then questioned if she had been there on that day, but Madani would instead only tell him to read his file about the incident on his arrest.

Russo asks Dinah Madani about her hatred
Russo had commented that his file claimed that Madani had arrested him, but also that Russo had somehow managed to shoot her in the head, which he admitted that he could not remember doing. He then noted that his file also claimed that they had engaged with a sexual relationship, which she downplayed. Russo questioned why Madani hated him so much, commenting on all of those nights and mornings they had spent together and how that had all been wasted, claiming that he envied her for being able to remember all that, making it clear that he wished he knew exactly how he had felt about Madani.

Russo mocks Dinah Madani's hatred for him
Gaining a grin on his face, Russo questioned if they had had sex in this apartment, although Madani instead demanded to know why he had come there, to which Russo had told her that he was looking for answers. Russo allowed Madani to make yet another drink for herself while he sat down on her chair, making it clear that he had already found and removed the other weapon that Madani had hidden inside there, questioning if she would shoot him if she had the chance, as Madani furiously insisted that she would in a heartbeat, claiming that Russo was now back in control just like he had always desired.

Russo threatening Dinah Madani for lying
While Madani called him the same psychotic asshole he had always been, Russo simply grinned, claiming that regardless of whether or not he had used her to get what he needed, he may have still liked her. Revealing that he had found his old journal which was filled with his sketches of the Skull Imagery, Russo commented on how he had discovered that Frank Castle was the one who destroyed his face. As Madani denied all knowledge of Castle, Russo became enraged and furiously threatened to kill her with her own gun, making it clear that he knew now that Madani had all of the answers that he needed.

Russo being told the truth about his past
Once Russo questioned how this happened to him, Madani stepped over to him and told Russo how he had sold out everything he had ever stood for in the Marine Corps, as well as everybody he had ever cared about in exchange for money and status, also telling the clearly horrified Russo that he had left Castle for dead covered in the blood of his wife and beloved children. Although Russo tried to deny that this was possible, Madani explained that when Castle discovered his betrayal he furiously came after him and got his revenge, with Russo also commenting that he did not believe that Madani was lying.

Russo mocks Dinah Madani over her dreams
Madani went on to claim that Castle had wanted Russo to live with his mistakes on his face for the rest of his life which was why he had scarred him, also claiming that Russo should simply shoot himself to get it over with, promising that Castle would return and finish the job. Remaining confident, Russo claimed that he was a hard man to kill and noted about the good times they shared together, commenting on how Madani wanted to kill him. Making a final mocking comment about how he believed that Madani was still dreaming of him, Russo then walked out, while promising to kill her if she followed him.

Dealing with the Truth
Russo talks about Frank Castle's late family
Returning into Krista Dumont's Apartment, Russo spoke to her about how much he had always loved Frank Castle's entire family, while also commenting that if there was any kind of possibility that he might have had any kind of a part in the Massacre at Central Park which had killed them, then he just deserved to die at the hands of Castle. However, Russo had insisted that what Castle did to his face and mind was considerably worse than whatever he deserved, claiming that there was no honor in that punishment.

Russo confesses to visiting Dinah Madani
Russo had insisted that, after everything that they had been through together in the Marine Corps he deserved more than what Castle had done to him. As Dumont questioned how Russo knew all of this, he confessed to going to see Dinah Madani at her Apartment, which had clearly made Dumont extremely uncomfortable as she commented on how risky such a decision was. Dumont questioned how Russo had felt seeing his former lover, but Russo simply insisted that he felt nothing as he could not remember his relationship with Madani while promising that the only person who mattered to him was Dumont.

Russo swearing that he will kill Frank Castle
As Dumont noted that Castle also mattered to him, Russo noted that he now knew that Madani was there when Castle had disfigured his face, while Dumont theorized that maybe Madani knew where Castle was. Russo insisted that Castle would never stop until he killed him, noting that he would not stop if it was the other way around, to which Dumont suggested that they leave New York City and hide, so they could live happily together without fear of the Punisher finding them. Russo, however, refused to run away, insisted that he would have put Castle out of his misery if their roles had instead been reversed.

Russo swears his revenge on the Punisher
Dumont insisted that Russo had something special which had been proved when he had built himself up from nothing twice, first through the founding of Anvil and then by building up Jigsaw's Crew. Dumont went on to claim that Castle did not take anything away from him when he had destroyed his face and damaged his mind, but he had instead given them a second chance at a new life together. Looking Dumont in the eyes, Russo told her that he wanted Castle to suffer in the way that he had suffered back at Central Park, while insisting that he wanted Castle to feel his pain, which made Dumont smile.

Preparing for an Ambush
Russo listening to Krista Dumont's plan
While still at Krista Dumont's Apartment, Russo kept himself out of sight while she shared a drink with Dinah Madani, who was unaware that Russo was also inside the Apartment. Having manipulated Madani into speaking with great detail about their investigation, Dumont said goodbye and then greeted Russo. Dumont had told Russo that she knew the way to defeat Frank Castle was to take away his belief that he was still a better man than Russo was and breaking him apart morally rather than physically.

Jigsaw discretely spying on Frank Castle
Jigsaw soon deduced that the Punisher would be coming to kill him soon enough, having discovered the location of Valhalla from finding and killing Moke before interrogating Lanie. Jigsaw kept himself out of sight as he found Castle was indeed spying on Valhalla from the building opposite, clearly confident that he would be able to take on Jigsaw while he was unaware, with Curtis Hoyle also assisting Castle in his mission. Jigsaw made no attempt to make his presence known to Castle since he wanted him to go into his assassination mission with complete confidence, so Jigsaw could then take advantage and launch his own ambush and finally destroy his former best friend.

Jigsaw delivering his speech to his crew
While the Punisher got ready to begin his assault, Jigsaw went back into Valhalla and spoke with Jigsaw's Crew and then questioned if everybody there was happy, noting how they were kings who now owned New York City through their violence. Jigsaw pointed out the original members who started the group, José, Phillip and Todd, as all the other original members were either arrested or killed. Jigsaw then claimed that Bobby was nothing more than a Judas who always had wanted more than everybody else and had actually thought he was better than them all, which was why Jigsaw had killed him.

Jigsaw emphasizes his claims to the crew
Jigsaw had told all his crew that there was another man who thought that he was better than all of them, noting how he had killed Moke as well as Geno and Mike, before naming him as the Punisher. Jigsaw had claimed that the Punisher had been just like them once when he had served in the United States Marine Corps, as Jigsaw called the Punisher his brother. Jigsaw explained that the Punisher was the one responsible how disfiguring his face, claiming that it was because the Punisher thought that he was better than him and that he thought he had to right to judge and kill them all like Moke, Geno and Mike.

Jigsaw voices his vendetta for the Punisher
Noting that the Punisher was neither a cop or judge, Jigsaw insisted that he did not have the right to kill them and that he had no loyalty to anyone other than himself, leading to José and Todd both vowing together that they would destroy him. Jigsaw then confessed that his vendetta against the Punisher was undeniably personal, promising that none of them had to take any part with this revenge, before then explaining that the Punisher was already out there and looking to kill him, insisting this plan the Punisher had was arrogant and this would lead to his downfall, even if many of them died in the process.

Jigsaw smiling at his followers' blind loyalty
Despite this warning about the danger that this revenge mission was going put them under, Todd promised that they would stand behind Jigsaw in this fight regardless of the risks, with the rest of the crew all agreeing to this due to their blind loyalty to their leader. While Jigsaw smiled at seeing all his men's loyalty to him, he noted that he did not want this revenge to be just about him, but each one of them taking him on for their own reasons, noting that the Punisher was just a man coming alone, while they were now a true brotherhood, which would always make them far stronger than the Punisher could ever be.

Jigsaw ends his speech about the Punisher
Although his men had expressed their desire to kill the Punisher once and for the pain and death that he had caused against their brothers, Jigsaw explained that he had a different plan for his former brother. Jigsaw had then furiously explained that he now wanted the Punisher to express more suffering than just death, explaining how he needed him to understand that pain that he had suffered when the Punisher had brutally destroyed his face, as Jigsaw then told his crew that he needed all of them to help him give this pain to the Punisher, as all of his followers had then nodded in agreement to Jigsaw's plans.

Jigsaw brutally killing innocent women
As his crew got into position for the ambush, Jigsaw gave two of his men some money and told them to take several of the women back home, knowing that the Punisher would only attack once he believed that there were no innocent people there. As José then questioned what their plan was, Jigsaw simply told him not to worry about it. Knowing that the only thing that would really break the Punisher was if he broke his moral code, Jigsaw brutally shot and murdered three of the innocent women in his office, setting up the scene so that the Punisher would believe that he had killed them in the crossfire.

Ambush at the Valhalla
Jigsaw prepares for the Punisher's ambush
Once night fell, Jigsaw had readied himself for the Punisher to come into Valhalla with the intention of finally killing him. Jigsaw had every member of his Crew grab their masks and wear all black, as they all would lead the Punisher into their brutal ambush where they would get their revenge for everything that he had done. Jigsaw also sent Phillip and some other men after Curtis Hoyle, who had been left on the nearby rooftop to act as a backup for the Punisher, leaving the Punisher alone and unaware of what was now coming for him.

Jigsaw watches the Punisher being beaten
Finally, the Punisher walked directly into their trap as Jigsaw had all of the lights shut off, which left the Punisher confused. Jigsaw then had a bright light flash, blinding the Punisher, while a member of his crew then shot him directly into his Bulletproof Vest with a non-lethal shotgun blast. As the lights going blasting on and off, with loud rock music also blaring out, Jigsaw's Crew charged out of the darkness and slashed at the Punisher with their blades, while Jigsaw remained to the side and continued to call out mocking insults to the Punisher, questioning how this brutal beating down had felt for him.

Jigsaw confronting the wounded Punisher
Eventually, the Punisher was beaten down to the point that he could no longer stand, as Jigsaw's crew continued slashing at his arms and legs and embedding their knives into his skull vest, causing non-fatal but horrifically painful injuries as they were all also beating him down with their crowbars as well as wrenches and baseball bats. With his former friend now lying beaten and bloody onto the floor, Jigsaw had then slowly stepped over to him, taking great personal pleasure in all of the pain the Punisher was in, as Jigsaw then placed his boot down onto the Punisher's chest, commenting on the mess he was in.

Jigsaw mocks the Punisher's failed ambush
While smiling his sadistic smile, Jigsaw had kneeled down onto the Punisher's chest, causing him to spit out blood as Jigsaw told him that he should have stayed in his hole, which called back to how the Punisher made the statement during their last encounter. Jigsaw had then told the Punisher that the good news was that all this pain was only temporary, which was something they would say to each other during their training within the United States Marine Corps while they were still friends. Looking at the Punisher in the eyes, Jigsaw finally told his crew to break him and then finish him before walking away.

Jigsaw escaping Valhalla from the Punisher
Jigsaw, however, knew the Punisher draw whatever strength he had left to go after him, as he managed to disarm and kill his attackers with their own weapons. Jigsaw charged through Valhalla to escape, using his own men as human shields while demanding that they kill the Punisher. As he escaped, Jigsaw ensured that the Punisher shot the office where the dead women were, leaving the Punisher to find them and emotionally break when he thought he had killed them all, resulting in the New York City Police Department arriving onto the scene and arresting the Punisher while Jigsaw had escaped.

Tormenting the Punisher
Russo calls Dinah Madani at the hospital
With the seriously injured Frank Castle now recovering inside Sacred Saints Hospital under the watchful eye of Brett Mahoney, Russo had decided to continue tormenting his former friend as he proceeded to call Dinah Madani who he knew would be visiting Castle. Russo mocked Madani by questioning if she was planning on visiting Castle every day like she had visited him during his own recovery.

Russo tells the Punisher and him are alike
However, as Madani invited him to come to the hospital and face her directly, Russo questioned if Castle was listening to the conversation, which Madani confirmed. Knowing that Castle could hear him, Russo began mocking his former friend by questioning how it felt for him to be locked up inside a cage like an animal with nothing but his dark thoughts to accompany him. As Russo promised that this pain would not leave Castle and that he was no better than him, since Castle still believed that he was responsible for the deaths of the women during their last encounter back at Valhalla where Castle was arrested.

Russo continues to taunt at the Punisher
Castle finally responded to all of Russo's rants against him by simply questioning if he was finished yet, to which Russo furiously insisted that Castle was the one who was done. Russo had then gone on to promise that for the rest of Castle's miserable life in prison he would remember that it was Russo who had put him in that situation as he had finally been able to defeat him, which had made Russo laugh for just a brief moment. While looking directly at Krista Dumont who had been listening to the conversation the entire time, Russo told Castle that he had won in their conflict before hanging up the phone.

Russo listens to Krista Dumont's reasoning
Sitting down opposite Dumont, Russo then insured that their phone call with Castle could not be traced by to her Apartment as he had ripped the phone apart and then tore the sim-card in half. Although Dumont noted that they now had Castle exactly where they wanted him to be, under the New York City Police Department's close watch, Russo noted that sometimes this was simply not enough, clearly still fearful of the Punisher ever catching up to him again. While Dumont had questioned what else Russo could possibly want, he noted that sometimes getting what he wanted proved to be disappointing.

Russo speaksing about what they had to do
Russo confessed to feeling hollow after defeating Castle, scratching his head out of stress while Dumont claimed that she had taken part in this mission only to make Russo happy. Interrupting her while she had tried to explain herself, Russo placed his empty gun cartridges on the table and noted how the murders of the three innocent women was a dark moment for both of them. Russo questioned how Dumont felt, noting that those women were only dead because of her actions, only for Dumont to simply dismiss this by noting that she simply had not known any of them to care whether they had lived or died.

Russo listens to Krista Dumont's promise
Dumont then questioned if Russo was blaming her for these deaths, to which Russo grabbed her arm and claimed that he was afraid that she would eventually blame him for everything. Dumont claimed that she did everything to protect Russo from the Punisher and the police, noting that they had to leave New York City before the police found him, although Russo worried over Dumont leaving behind everything that she had managed to build for him. Despite Russo offering her a chance to walk away from his life, Dumont swore her loyalty to Russo as they promised to stay together while they passionately kissed.

New Direction
Learning Dumont's Past
Russo asks Krista Dumont about her scars
Russo and Krista Dumont proceeded to have sex again, as Russo had taken a moment to look at her scars while she put her clothes back on, although Dumont soon made it clear that she did not like this. As Russo continued to ask her about this, Dumont turned it around and threatened to ask Russo about his dreams about the Skull Imagery again, claiming that all of these scars were a similar cause for trauma for her.

Russo expresses his hatred of nightmares
Although Russo noted that he hated his own nightmares because he had not been able to remember the truth, Dumont explained that she hated the fact that she did. Although Dumont had tried to dismiss the conversation, Russo noted that she knew everything about him from his military records to those police reports, he claimed that he did not actually know anything about her. Dumont claimed that she had told him the truth about his scars, although Russo insisted that she was missing out important details, noting that he might as well have told her about a painful shoulder while explaining his own facial scars.

Russo questioning Krista Dumont about KM
Through this reasoning, Russo managed to convince Dumont to tell him the truth, noting that these scars they both carried had led them to each other and everything they had done since, including killing innocent people. When Dumont tried to insist that she did everything to protect him, Russo questioned why she did that, to which she had claimed that she loved him. Russo questioned who KM really was, as he reminded Dumont of how he had been included in all his personal medical files when she had compared them. When Russo then asked, Dumont admitted to loving KM, but noted that he was her father.

Russo listens to Krista Dumont's experience
Dumont told Russo how her father had served with the United States Armed Forces and had also suffered from PTSD upon his return back home to New York City. Russo had then listened carefully as Dumont noted how her father became drunk and angry when he learned how Dumont's mother had wanted to get a divorce from their marriage, resulting in a smashed window. As Russo listened, Dumont explained how her father had become so emotionally broken by everything that was happening that he threw himself out of the window with Dumont in his arms, resulting in her father's death and all of her scars.

Frank Castle's Escape
Russo questions Krista Dumont's failed plan
While in her Apartment, Russo had come across Krista Dumont while she was listening to a news report on how Frank Castle managed to escape from Sacred Saints Hospital, during which he was attacked by John Pilgrim but still managed to get away despite the best efforts of Brett Mahoney. Seeing Dumont turn off the television when she saw him, Russo questioned if she had planned on telling him about Castle's escape, to which she insisted that it simply did not matter whether Castle escaped or that she wanted to hide it from him.

Russo questioning Krista Dumont's secrecy
Although Dumont claimed that she was not thinking about this at all, Russo noted that Dumont was always thinking. As Dumont continued insisting that Castle's escape did not change anything, Russo again questioned why she would keep it from him if she really believed that Castle being free would not affect them. Finally, Dumont admitted that the Punisher scared her as he would keep on coming for them no matter what they did, to which Russo then noted that Castle was clearly relentless. When Dumont noted that Castle had nothing else to live for, Russo questioned if her point was that Russo did now.

Russo listens to Krista Dumont's statement
Russo then turned away from Dumont and grabbed his jacket, while she asked him why he was acting this way, questioning if Russo was trying to punish her for just wanting one minute where Castle was not the focus of their lives, before asking Russo if he was planning to go after the Punisher again. Russo instead softly touched Dumont's face and told her that he was going out to get all their paperwork so they could finally leave New York City behind them as they had planned. Despite the promises, Dumont had questioned Russo about whether or not he would actually be able to leave the Punisher behind him.

Russo tells Krista Dumont that they will go
Thinking for a moment, Russo told Dumont that ever since he had been done with Castle, following the Ambush at Valhalla and spent time with just Dumont, he had never felt anything quite like it before, claiming that he had never felt so happy in his life. Russo then told Dumont that she was right, that by cutting the Punisher out of his life, comparing him to cancer, he must never allow him back in. While Russo turned to leave the Apartment to get all of their paperwork so they could leave New York together, Dumont told him to promise he would return, to which Russo insisted he would be back soon.

Giving His Crew Freedom
Russo visiting his crew again at the hideout
Returning to Valhalla, Russo found the surviving members of his crew were there waiting for him, as Russo noted that they could have all taken their money and run. José, however, spoke up and noted that there were only five surviving crew members left, noting that what had gone down was messed up, insisting that they should have just killed the Punisher when they had the chance. However, Russo noted that their Campaign was never going to last forever and it had always been destined to end this way.

Russo tells the crew to not kill the Punisher
As José then noted how the Punisher had killed a lot of their friends, including Todd, before managing to escape from the New York City Police Department, with José insisting that they owed the Punisher some payback using whatever weapons they had left, noting that apparently the Punisher was hurt, which would give them the perfect opportunity to kill him. Russo insisted that while he understands their desire for revenge, he knew that killing the Punisher would not bring their friends back, noting that they all now had something to lose, as José had then realized that Russo wanted to let Castle get away.
