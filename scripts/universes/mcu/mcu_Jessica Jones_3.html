She went back to her apartment, where she was reunited with Malcolm Ducasse and discovered her answering machine was filled with thousands of messages, which she deleted, not interested in helping them. However, she thought to herself that maybe if the people believed her to be hero, she could fool herself into thinking the same as well.

Entering her home, she received a phone call that she didn't answer. When the phone went to voice mail, the caller, in a distorted voice filter, eerily warned Jones not to find John Raymond. Now knowing that something was up, Jones immediately began investigating on Raymond.

Jones began searching for information on Raymond. During the search, Malcolm Ducasse suggested that Jones try and track the phone call, the caller might have made a mistake. It turned out that the call came from a payphone at 11th and 49th. Ducasse recalled from his experience on doing heroin that people went to the location to do shady dealings.

Jones kept pressing for Raymond to tell her who he was talking about.

Before they could continue, they were interrupted by the arrival of a sword wielding assassin. When the assassin attempted to capture Raymond, he shot himself in the head. Jones pursued the attacker but she skillfully escaped her. Once outside her apartment, Jones encountered Knight who immediately arrested her.

War for New York
Jones vs Murdock
Jones reluctantly talked to her new attorney. She learned that Murdock was called to help her from Hogarth. Jones refused to answer Murdock's questions and she wanted another lawyer. Murdock told her that she didn't have too, since the New York City Police Department didn't have any evidence on her and that she was allowed to leave. When Murdock asked about the case she was doing, Jones refused to answer. Jones left the interrogation room and immediately called Ducasse for his whereabouts and what she told the police.

Jones talking with Danny Rand
Once away from Midland Circle, the Defenders sought shelter at the Royal Dragon restaurant. They were allowed to stay after Rand managed to bribe the owner. Jones was skeptical when Rand explained that the enemy they fought against were called the Hand as well as their mysticism.

She also defused tension between Murdock and Cage and convinced the latter to stay when he wanted to leave.

The Defenders discussed their next move. During their discussion, Jones advised the group to fight them without incriminating themselves, as their actions were against the law.

When the old man further explained the situation, Jones couldn't believe him when he explained that the Hand was responsible for numerous disasters in the past. Further, Stick's attitude aggravated Jones and she left the restaurant. Cage followed and tried in vain to convince her to stay.

Jones speaks with Michelle Raymond
Returning back home, Jones began deleting the photos she had taken during her investigation. She stopped when she realized that the documents with decades apart were signed by the same person. Believing that the mysterious Hand might be real, Jones went to the Raymonds to check on them and inform them about getting some protection. When Raymond told Jones about someone already keeping an eye on them, Jones immediately went to confront the man watching them. She interrogated the man and when she learned about her allies back at the restaurant were about to get attacked, Jones headed back.

She arrived in time to crash a car through the restaurant and knock down Elektra. Rejoining her team, Jones prepared to face the Hand alongside the Defenders.

Daredevil arrived to assist Jones to drive off the Hand leader. After sarcastically commenting on her rescuer's costume, Jones brought Walker to the NYPD for protection.

Jones returned to their hideout to continue interrogate Sowande. During an attempt to escape with Rand, the team learned that the Hand intend to use the Iron Fist to open a sealed door of K'un-Lun origin. Sowande was subsequently decapitated by Stick.

The revelation caused a splinter in the group. Jones agreed with the rest of the team to hold Rand away, much to his protest. This escalated into a fight, which Jones was forced to end by knocking Rand unconscious. They tied him up. Without any option, Jones decided to return to the Raymonds to look for clues, as John Raymond was the one who designed Midland Circle Financial.

Returning back to the Raymonds, Murdock found a construction plan of the Midland Circle. They learned that beneath the building, there was a large tunnel cave. With this discovery, Jones and Murdock headed back to rejoin the team. When they returned, they found Elektra attacking Stick while Cage and Rand were unconscious. When Elektra killed Stick and incapacitated Murdock, Jones was forced to fight the assassin alone. Unable to match Elektra's superior fighting skills, she was defeated and knocked unconscious.

Regrouping, Rebelling, Retaliation
Jones woke up and found herself once again in the precinct, with Knight interrogate her. She was informed that the cops brought them back to the precinct after discovering them unconscious with two corpses. Jones reunited with Cage and Murdock to be further questioned by the police. Eventually, Murdock managed to convince them to talk alone. They used this distraction to escape the precinct.

Jones rides the train with Matt Murdock and Luke Cage
Now determined to prevent the Hand's plans and save Rand, the Defenders began making their way toward Midland Circle, using the metro to avoid the authorities. Along the way, Jones stole a drink from a nearby sleeping passenger. The Defenders arrived at Midland Circle and entered through the parking lot. Inside they were confronted by three of the Hand leaders: Madame Gao, Murakami and Bakuto. A fierce confrontation took place in the parking lot. They managed to drive them away by the timely arrival of Colleen Wing, Claire Temple, and Misty Knight.

Wing informed them about her plan to collapse the entire building with Raymond's explosives. Jones agreed to the plan to use explosives to level the building and end the Hand's threat once and for all.

Final Battle beneath Midland Circle
Jones and the Defenders fight the Hand
The Defenders used the elevator to head down to the cave to face the Hand. As Daredevil suggested using Jones as a distraction. When the elevator arrived at the bottom, Jones greeted the Hand alone and provided Daredevil and Luke Cage an opportunity to ambush the Hand. During the fight, Jones rescued Iron Fist and helped him get back to the team. With the Defenders reunited, the team went and fought against the Hand, who is now led by Elektra, who had killed Alexandra Reid and usurped her position.

Jones and the Defenders defeated the majority of the Hand. When only Elektra remained, they defeated her and began retreating. Daredevil chose to stay behind to try and save her despite Jones' protest. As they escaped on the elevator, they were followed by the surviving Hand members led by Murakami. Another battle ensued as the remaining Defender fought off the Hand. During the battle, the elevator was damaged. Fortunately, Jones saved Cage and Rand by jumping and grabbing the broken cable, holding the elevator with her super-strength.

They managed to return to the surface and reunited with their remaining allies. They made their escape from Midland Circle just in time before the bomb exploded and level the building. Jones returned to the precinct to reunite with Trish Walker and Malcolm Ducasse. The remaining Defenders mourned for their fallen teammate.

Reopening Alias Investigation
Days after the final battle, Jones asked Walker to make sure that no one knew about their heroics. Taking Murdock's apparent death hard, Jones returned to the bar to drown her sorrows. Cage went to meet her. The former couple talked through their issues and about what happened beneath Midland Circle. Cage assured Jones that she had friends and that he was one of them.

Jones wants to dump them, too, but Walker insists on keeping it. Jessica is returning to her apartment when Malcolm Ducasse approaches her about an eviction notice from her landlord. Apparently, it is illegal to run a business out of a living space, which is what Jones does by running Alias Investigations out of her apartment. Jessica suspects who may be behind it, and goes to her neighbor Arocho's apartment. Arocho doesn't deny her claim, and says it's for the best as she would only bring trouble to the building, saying she has thirty days left before she has to move out.

Jones in the office

Jones is working at her office and posts pictures from Walker's files on the walls all around the room while drinking a bottle of whiskey. She suddenly wakes in her bed with an IV of whiskey strapped into her and ashes falling from the ceiling. She gets up and goes to find her front door has been replaced by a hospital door resembling a door from the clinic she saw in the pictures. She is about to open it when once again the red, meaty figure attacks her from behind, and she wakes up with Ducasse knocking on her door.
Investigating Leslie Hansen
Jones and Malcolm Ducasse converse in her office. He reveals that he did research on Oscar and found that he served time for forgery, meaning he is an ex-con. After Ducasse makes a comment about how good the old superintendent was, Jones realizes that Arocho must have something on the landlord, and ask Malcolm to find out what it is. Jessica visits the IGH Clinic and goes through the door she saw in her dream, but only discovers the name "Leslie Hansen" on the door, and nothing useful inside. She and Walker go to Leslie Hansen's apartment to find it empty, and a man tells them he saw someone taking boxes from the apartment down to the basement the week before.

Jessica meeting Leslie Hansen at a bar
Jones is inverted to a bar to meet Leslie Hansen. At the bar, "Hansen" defends IGH as heroes, saying that they brought back Jessica from the dead, since she died on the table. IGH was merely trying to save lives, according to Hansen, and that the powers were merely a side effect. Jessica says they should have let her die with her family, which angers Leslie, who says she should be incredibly thankful to them, and that she survived for a reason. Jessica says that if she did survive for a reason, it was so she could take down Leslie and IGH. Hansen makes a run for it, and Jessica tries to stop her with her, but Hansen displays similar powers, knocking Jessica across the room and through a wall with incredible strength. Jessica comes out, and Hansen jumps across the street and on to the top of a building across the street. Jessica doesn't try to follow her, but instead takes the photographer's camera, which managed to take several photos of the fake Hansen.

Anger Management
Jessica Jones at anger management
Jones is forced to partake in an anger management class after she attacked Pryce Cheng. The people attending the class tell their stories while bouncing a rubber ball against the wall. Jones asks the head of the class to sign her court order, but he says she has to stay the full hour, and encourages her to talk with the class. She gets up and bounces the ball against the wall while telling the story of how her family was killed in a car accident, she was experimented on, how she was abducted and raped, and forced to kill someone. She ends by bouncing the ball so hard against the wall it creates a dent, and pieces of the wall fly across the room. The man fearfully signs the court order, and Jones leaves.

Jones returns to her office and gets angry at Malcolm Ducasse for letting Trish Walker get out of her apartment the night before, as now the press (who got photos of Walker and Ducasse together) are calling Malcolm Trish's new boyfriend. Jessica looks at the photos of the fake Hansen, and tries to find something, but finds it is hard to concentrate as Oscar Arocho and his ex-wife are arguing above her. Despite this, Jessica notices she was wearing a wig. Jessica calls Trish who is having to deal with the aftermath of last night with the press. She asks Trish about wigs, saying the woman was wearing one. Trish says it was a good wig since she didn't notice, speculating it to be human hair, which narrows down their search as there are only three human hair wig shops in NYC. Jessica agrees to meet Trish at one of them, and hangs up.

Falling in Love
Oscar Arocho's son Vido enters Jones' office, not wanting to be around his arguing parents. He questions Jones about her powers while Jones yells down the hallway to Vido's parents that he's in her apartment when they start looking for him. He crouches on the outside of her window ledge, and asks if she could save him if he fell. She yells at him to get off and he falls. Joned pulls him up just as his parents arrive. His mother is angry, seeing it as another reason for her to have custody of Vido, and drags her son away. Arocho angrily tells Jones she has 25 days left before she is evicted before running after them.

Jones and Walker meeting Sally
Jessica and Trish meet up at the wig place. Trish has to pay the owner, Sally, three hundred dollars to give them info on the woman when the owner confirms the woman as a customer of her store. Sally tells them the woman comes in alone, pays in cash, and lost all her hair, probably to chemotherapy. Jessica speculates that she probably had cancer and IGH saved her. She also says that if they found her though Metro-General, IGH is probably paying her medical bills, so they need her hospital records.

Jones and Walker treating Max Tatum
Trish shows Jessica the video Malcolm took of her and Max Tatum, saying they could use it as leverage against him, and use his clearance at the hospital to get the records. Jessica points out that her threats won't hold much water as Trish gave Max two days and it's been three. Planning on blackmailing him more, Trish and Jessica head off to his movie set. Trish and Jessica would show a young actress currently starring in Max's film the video about being sexually assaulted by Max, which she quits, much to Max's dismay. The two confront him at his car, and after Jessica threatens him a little with her powers, he agrees to give them his clearance at Metro-General.

Jones kissing Oscar Arocho
There is a knock on Jones' door. She answers it to find Arocho. He apologizes, saying Vido told him what happened, and that he cannot express how grateful he is that she saved his son's life. He says he has dropped her eviction, and leaves her with a bottle of whiskey, but she invites him to drink with her inside. Arocho and Jones share the whiskey on her couch and discuss her powers. He admits that he doesn't hate people like her, he just hated her in particular. She admits what it's like to be an outcast and they bond. Jones starts to kiss him, and attempts to unzip his pants, but Oscar backs out, saying that things are moving too fast and that the situation is not normal and he leaves.

Jones leaves her apartment the next day and heads for the elevator when Malcolm approaches her in the hallway. He tells her about how Cheng offered him a place at his firm in exchange for info on her. He says he said no, but that he still wants more to do at Alias Investigations, and demands 25% of the cases that come in. She agrees to give him 20% before leaving. He then goes back to his apartment and mixes up the name of one of the girls he met on a dating app.
