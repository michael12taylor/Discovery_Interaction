<html><p>Regardless, Hawkeye had achieved his mission's goal, so he activated the Time-Space GPS and was momentarily transported back through the Quantum Realm, back to the present, where all the other Avengers safely returned. There was an initial celebration from the other Avengers, which was interrupted when Hawkeye fell to his knees. The others saw Hawkeye alone and asked about Black Widow's whereabouts, but he was too upset to respond, but they were able to understand what had happened.

Barton mourning Natasha Romanoff's death
The remaining original Avengers gathered outside and let the news of their friend's death sink in. However, Thor believed that Romanoff could too be brought back along with everyone else. However, Barton made it clear to him that there was no way to undo what had happened. Barton then got upset, stating that it should have been him that made the sacrifice. They then decided not to let their friend's death go without meaning, so they started working on making a Nano Gauntlet capable of wielding all Infinity Stones.

The Blip
The Avengers discuss the Nano Gauntlet
With all the Infinity Stones in their possession, Tony Stark, along with Bruce Banner and Rocket Raccoon began creating an Nano Gauntlet that could house all of the Infinity Stones and allow the wearer to wield all them. When they were done, they discussed who should be the one to snap their fingers; Thor desperately believing he should do it, wanting to do something right.

Barton watches Hulk wield the Infinity Stones
However, they came to the realization that Banner must be the one to do it, due to the levels of Gamma Radiation, and that anyone else would be killed from. As Banner was about to wield the gauntlet, each Avenger suited up and made sure to protect themselves from any blast, Barton stood by Stark, who had generated a shield in front of them. As Banner became overwhelmed by the Stones' power, he was able to snap his fingers, attempting to reverse the Snap and bring everyone back.

Barton gets a call from his resurrected wife
Afterwards, Banner collapsed to the floor, and the gauntlet fell off. Barton kicked the gauntlet away, telling no one to move it. They then checked on Banner, when suddenly, Barton's phone began to ring. He checked his phone and saw that it was his wife calling, revealing that they were successful. He answered the call and attempted to talk to his wife when suddenly, the Facility was attacked by Thanos, blasting Barton backwards, causing him to fall to the undergrounds of the facility.

Attack on the Avengers Facility
Hawkeye awakes underneath the rubble
Hawkeye found himself under some rubble, having fallen through to the access tunnels of the New Avengers Facility. He took a moment to recover from the impact of the explosion, as he turned on a flashlight on his wrist to see where he was, calling out to the other Avengers. Hawkeye then noticed the Nano Gauntlet on the ground, when he then heard movement behind him.

Hawkeye takes aim at all of the Outriders
Hawkeye drew his bow and quickly turned around, firing a flare arrow towards the movement, where he caught a glimpse of the Outriders. He then grabbed the gauntlet, and ran from the creatures, trying to protect the Infinity Stones from falling into the wrong hands. As Hawkeye made his way through the tunnels, he was finding himself about to be overrun by Outriders, so he started planting explosive arrows along the tunnel.

Hawkeye tries to run from several Outriders
The arrows then went off, causing the Outriders to be caught in the explosion, with Hawkeye just avoiding it. However, when he looked back, he noticed the Outriders were still alive and heading for him. He then fired a grapple arrow from his Wristbow and scaled upwards to safety. However, this did not stop the Outriders, who continued to viciously go after Hawkeye, climbing upwards to get him.

Hawkeye manages to defeats the Outriders
He then drew his sword and began to fend off the ruthless creatures, slicing them in half as they leaped at him. He then made it to the level above, eliminating all of them, screaming at the Outriders in his victory. Exhausted by his recent fight, Hawkeye laid down to rest for a moment, when he noticed Nebula approach him. Unaware that this was not the Nebula he had been working with, but the 2014 version of her from the alternate timeline, he handed the gauntlet over to her.

Hawkeye held at gunpoint by 2014 Nebula
When Nebula revealed her true nature, Hawkeye attempted to stop her from giving the Gauntlet to Thanos, but he was unsuccessful due to her pulling a gun out on him. Before she could kill him, Nebula was stopped by Gamora and the Nebula from the present. When Nebula pulled her gun away from Hawkeye to aim at the present day Nebula, he moved to safety, as he watched present day Nebula kill the other Nebula. Confused by what just happened, Hawkeye then picked up the gauntlet and continued to protect it as he made his way out of the facility.

Battle of Earth
Hawkeye protecting the Nano Gauntlet
When all the heroes who had perished to the Snap returned to help fight against Thanos and his massive army, Hawkeye stood amongst his fellow Avengers as Captain America led the charge. During the battle, Hawkeye continued to protect the Infinity Stones, carrying the Nano Gauntlet around with him as he made his way through the battlefield. Not being able to properly fight while holding onto the gauntlet, Hawkeye managed to avoid numerous attacks from Thanos' army, with assistance from the other heroes.

Hawkeye fighting during the Battle of Earth
Being in a position of danger with all of the Infinity Stones, Hawkeye asked Captain America about what he should do with the stones. He told him to get the stones away from the battlefield, but Hulk interjected, telling him that they needed to get the stones back to where they got them. Ant-Man informed them that Luis' van was on the battlefield and could be used to get the stones back. Hawkeye then made his way to the van, fighting off many hordes of Outriders with his Sword and Wristbow. As he pursued, he was spotted by Ebony Maw who sent more of Thanos' army towards him. As Hawkeye witnessed the massive creatures draw near, he was saved by Black Panther, who used his kinetic pulse to blast the enemies away.

Hawkeye being assisted by Black Panther
He then acknowledged Hawkeye, calling him by his first name, something he learned during the Clash of the Avengers, and told him to hand over the gauntlet. Hawkeye did so, knowing that he was faster and would be able to get past Thanos' army easier than he would. With the gauntlet out of his possession, Hawkeye was now able to fully join the fight. Hawkeye, along with all the other heroes were able to fight off Thanos' army, but it wasn't until Iron Man wielded all the Infinity Stones, that they were victorious. All of Thanos' army disintegrated, followed by the Mad Titan himself.

Hawkeye kneels to show respect to Iron Man
However, this came at the cost of Iron Man's life, due to the immense power of the stones. As Iron Man died on the battlefield, everyone gathered around him. Hawkeye saw his friend who he had fought beside many times, and out of respect, knelt before him as he mourned his death. This was then followed by Black Panther, who noticed Hawkeye kneeling, proceeded by everyone else kneeling in front of the fallen hero.

Return to Family Life
Barton is finally reunited with his family
Having been successful in bringing back those who died, as well as defeating Thanos, Barton took a Quinjet and returned to his homestead, where his family was now alive.

Barton and his wife kiss as they reunite
As Barton approached his house, Lila, Cooper, and Nathaniel came outside and reunited with their father, holding each other in their arms. After hugging his children, Barton looked over and saw his wife. He and Laura walked over to each other and embraced one another. Now that his family had been brought back, Barton could return to his retirement.

The Barton family attend Tony Stark's funeral
Barton and his family all attended the funeral for his friend and fellow Avenger, Tony Stark, along with all of their allies. Barton, along with Stark's family, Happy Hogan, James Rhodes and the remaining original Avengers, gathered inside Stark's home, where they watched a recorded message Stark left before the Time Heist. They all then stood outside as Stark's Arc Reactor was sent adrift in the lake.

Barton and Wanda Maximoff jointly comfort
Afterwards, Barton reunited with his close friend Wanda Maximoff and confided in her about his desire to be able to let Natasha Romanoff know that they were successful in bringing everyone back. Maximoff assured him that Romanoff knew, as well as Vision. The two then comforted each other over the loss of the people close to them. Afterwards, Barton and his family returned home and continued to live their life together on their homestead.

Personality
Clint Barton is a brave operative with a deadpan focus; dedicated to his job of protecting the innocent. Through his years of being with S.H.I.E.L.D., Barton had made himself one of their best soldiers, tacticians, and marksmen, and had shown great loyalty and dedication to whatever his objective is, and always gets the mission done, as he will fight until the end and then keep fighting. However, despite this commitment, Barton has proven himself to be a maverick, disobeying orders in order to do what he believes is right as well as seeing through whatever he does his own way. When Phil Coulson gave Barton orders to use a gun to take aim at Thor but he chose to grab a bow, his signature weapon, as he knew that he is at his best with it.

However, two people Barton has ultimately shown to follow completely are Nick Fury and Steve Rogers due to their qualities he holds to value. He admires Fury's clear line of sight, something Barton maintains in situations and respects Rogers' ability to always fight for what is right. This is why Barton, even while under the influence of Loki, managed to spare Fury, and chose to help Rogers during the Avengers Civil War. In addition to this, Barton trusts Rogers' leadership of the Avengers and performs as the ideal soldier in battle, following his orders and strategies, as seen when he took the Regeneration Cradle to Avengers Tower, despite wanting to save Black Widow, and requesting for Rogers' plan during the Battle of Earth when he was protecting the Nano Gauntlet.

Though commonly misjudged and underestimated as one of the most underpowered Avengers, with his ability to blend in with his environment, his stoic professionalism, and ability to see and assess from afar, Barton is often valued by his superiors for his ability to keep an eye on people and assess situations. For this, he was able to figure out that the Tesseract could be activated from another location, as well as know the weaknesses of the Avengers and how to exploit it when under Loki's influence. He was also able to stay alert and level headed during the Battle at the Salvage Yard and not succumb to the effects of the Scarlet Witch, unlike the other Avengers, who were easily subdued due to their more reckless approach.

It is because of this that Barton can even understand when he is outmatched and accept it and use his skills to benefit him. When he went to rescue Wanda Maximoff, he knew that he could not defeat the Vision, despite placing traps to stop him but instead had Wanda defeat him. When he was being chased by a group of Outriders, despite knowing he could not outrun them Barton endured with protecting the Infinity Stones. During the Avengers Civil War, Barton also understood that in order for them to win, some of them had to sacrifice themselves and be arrested, including himself.

For Barton, this is not a tough call, as he is willing to sacrifice himself for what is right. That is why he went back to save a Sokovian boy who was missing, even though Barton himself was safe from the near destructing country because for Barton, he needs to make sure that everyone is safe no matter how the fight is going. So even though there was a massive army of aliens attacking, Barton went to rescue a bus filled with civilians who were trapped, rather than fight them off with Black Widow. And when he and Black Widow were informed that one of them had to sacrifice themselves in order to obtain the Soul Stone, Barton didn't hesitate to allow himself to be the one to do it, especially in order to save his best friend and redeem himself for his actions.

Despite his professionalism and approach to missions, Barton is a humorous and often sarcastic person and is able to not take things too seriously, even in the midst of a battle where he can sometimes be overwhelmed. Whether it be fighting aliens, robots or even fellow Avengers, Barton will constantly make a joke or bring levity to a situation, mainly when he is fighting alongside his best friend and partner, Black Widow, one of the few people who not only understand Barton’s level of banter, but is also able to keep up with it.

This is due to their many years of working together, which developed into a strong friendship, where the two could be completely comfortable with each other. As a result, Barton trusted her with the secret of his family, and she told him about her dark past. And when both were compromised, the other cared for them as they recovered. Because of their closeness, they often stay together in situations as that's how they work best. This allows them to frequently not be serious as seen in the Battle of New York where both of them made jokes about the situation, when the two were casually having a conversation during the chaotic Battle of Sokovia. And when Barton lost his family, he had become more hardened, which Black Widow tried to help him through. However, this was partially restored once he was given hope, and he continued to joke with his friend during the Time Heist, as seen when the two were on Morag, waiting for Nebula and War Machine, jokingly being impatient.

Barton's humor is occasionally used to compensate for him being overwhelmed in situations that include people like Thor, a literal god. However, despite his ability, or lack thereof, Barton is respected and valued in the Avengers, being seen as equal to them, being able to confidently express doubt about Thor’s hammer, but also open to be made fun of, all in good sense as they are all friends. And when the team planned to retrieve the Infinity Stones and bring everyone back, Barton was seen as essential in order for the whole team to be together. Barton is mainly the one who makes the jokes at a constant, even in moments of pain, seriousness or conflict, such as the Avengers Civil War or when Red Skull revealed the cost for the Soul Stone, not initially believing him. For this, Barton is seen as the jokester of the team.

Because of this, Barton can sometimes be seen as more immature than the other Avengers, as well as being cocky and always feels the need to be competitive with anyone who acts as a challenge. When he was easily bested by the enhanced Quicksilver, Barton then happily participated in a rivalry with him, despite it being childish as he is much older than the adolescent. He also uses his perfect aim to show off, such as hitting a moving target without looking, especially towards those who appear to be more powerful or better than him, mainly Tony Stark. While Stark casually threw darts, Barton decided to hit the bullseye with three darts at the same time, right next to Stark’s head, disarming the usually confident and always-in-control billionaire.

He is also seen to be very revengeful and does not take kindly towards being betrayed or manipulated. After regaining control from Loki’s influence, Barton was then motivated to fight by the thought of killing his former enslaver. During the battle against Loki, even though focusing on protecting others and stopping the attack, Barton seized the moment to get revenge by exploding an arrow right next to the God of Mischief, defeating him. However, Barton is not as immature when the person who wrongs him is someone he trusts. For Barton, trust is very important, but when Stark, a man who Barton was good friends with and even revealed his secret family to him, had a hand in fighting against and arresting him, Barton became furious and lost his respect for him, even to label him as someone who can never be trusted. However, this would change over the years as they worked together again to reverse the Snap, which resulted in Stark's death.

Uniquely, Barton is quite compassionate for an assassin, as he sees the good in people and who they could be, rather than who they were. For this, Barton is seen as a better man, then a good soldier. When he was ordered to kill Black Widow, he made the call to spare her, recruiting her for S.H.I.E.L.D., and developing a great friendship with her, while others would only see her as a merciless assassin, beyond redemption. From this, Barton developed a strong partnership with Romanoff, caring for her deeply at all times, as seen when he would go to check on her when she was affected by Scarlet Witch and frustrated when Ultron captured her, causing him to not stop searching for her. When the two were faced with the realization that one of them would have to sacrifice themselves for the Soul Stone, Barton could not bring himself to allow her to do so, forcing himself to be the one, to only be stopped by Romanoff, who also didn't want to allow her best friend to die, wanting to give him another chance, as he did for her when they met.

This is also seen with Wanda Maximoff, one of the other people Barton possesses a close bond with. Much like Romanoff, he inspired Maximoff to move past her conflicted history and do good and help fight with the Avengers against Ultron. Since her brother's death, ultimately saving Barton, he has felt some responsibility towards Wanda, him being a father figure towards her, guiding her and making sure she does what is right. That is why he was happy to rescue her from the New Avengers Facility, giving her the opportunity to make amends for her actions. Despite both of them being at either end of the scale in regards to powers: Wanda being incredibly powerful and Barton being a regular man with a skillset, this does not come into play within their relationship, but rather they see past that and focus more on accepting the reality of their situations and doing what needs to be done.

Barton is a very loyal, caring and dedicated person who would do anything for the people he cares about. But the most important people in his life, are his family, who are very supportive in his role as an Avenger. Being a loving husband and father, Barton thinks about his family before a battle, motivating him, and would call them afterward to tell them he is fine. However, because he cares so much about them, he decided to retire to be with them. Although, if he was ever needed, Barton would also go to help his friends if they asked him, especially Wanda. Barton being a compassionate person and a family man goes hand in hand with each other and is what separates him with the other Avengers. It is the experience of being a husband and a father that makes him the man he is.

Due to this, it was the death of his family that caused him to fall into a state of grief and rage that fuelled his path of vengeance, becoming extremely ruthless, murdering those who he saw as deserving of death. Because without his family, the only thing that was important to him, he was reduced to only his skillset used for killing people. Despite seeing his actions as necessary at the time, Barton believed himself to have gone too far for redemption. However, he was able to overcome this, mainly due to honor his best friend who still believed in him, and sacrificed herself to bring everyone back, including Barton's family. Therefore, he took comfort when Wanda told him that she would have known that they would have been successful.

Barton's place on the Avengers can be misconceived, with him not having any powers, but in fact, he is incredibly vital to the team's unity. As the other members either have extraordinary powers or are beings beyond human, Barton grounds the team and makes sure that they stay focused and helps them to be better. However, despite this, Barton still can seem very overwhelmed by the other members. However, he does not let that stop him. Barton is able to address the absurdity of his situation, such as fighting against an army of robots with a bow and arrow, but he keeps fighting anyway. From this, Barton is able to understand his place amongst the Avengers, usually taking a high vantage point, assessing the situation, and keeps up with the Avengers, showing to be confident in his place.

Abilities
Clint Barton's main ability is his extraordinary talent in marksmanship, with a particular specialty in archery. Barton's unique skills have made him a core member of the Avengers, and one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s best agents prior to the fall of the agency. His keen awareness is extremely superb, as shown during Battle at the Salvage Yard, he was the only one who could sense Maximoff's presence and immediately incapacitate her before she was able to mind control him, while others like Black Widow, enhanced human like Captain America, and even extremely powerful beings like Hulk and Thor failed to do so. Barton was the first person to come to Bruce Banner's mind when the latter realized the Avengers would require "all hands on deck" in the fight against Thanos and his army. In addition to his skills, Barton is an excellent mentor; under his tutelage, his daughter would become an expert archer to the point where she can hit a bullseye with ease.

Hawkeye perfectly lining up a shot in the wind
Master Marksman: Hailed as the world's greatest marksman, Barton is an outstanding all-around marksman, tremendously skilled in wielding both conventional firearms and archery bows with unerring accuracy due to his keen eyesight and impeccable hand-eye coordination. Barton is able to make extremely precise and perfect shots from virtually any angle, physical position, or state of motion. He is capable of firing multiple arrows in a few seconds, strike enemies' weak points with extreme accuracy and directly hit small targets in the greatest of distances, and even precisely shoot down a Chitauri Chariot without even looking at it. Barton was able to aim and hit many Chitauri troopers and Ultron Sentries in the head. Barton is a left-handed bowman, meaning he holds the bow with his right hand and draws the string with his left, although he did once hold his compound bow with his left hand while drawing the string with his right when he aimed an arrow at Thor, implying he is ambidextrous. During the Clash of the Avengers, he fired three arrows at Iron Man simultaneously. Barton sometimes uses a Wristbow, which he has been shown to wear on either arm. Barton is also capable of throwing any projectile with the same unerring accuracy, both in direct aim and complicated rebounds or interactions, as seen with him scoring a bullseye with three darts simultaneously thrown in a far distance without effort, and perfectly throwing Captain America's shield with similar precision. Barton also used shuriken when going under a samurai-inspired guise, taking down enemies at long range with perfect accuracy. During his retirement, he often played golf where he claimed to hit a hole-in-one every single time, proving that he is also able to make perfect shots with projectiles that don't require throwing or shooting.
Hawkeye pinning Black Widow
Master Martial Artist: Barton is an enormously skilled master hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist, having been extensively trained in various forms of martial arts as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., making him one of the most dangerous and best fighters on the planet. His fighting style appears to be composed of eskrima, muay thai, judo, taijutsu, kenjutsu, and shurikenjutsu. When brainwashed by Loki, he could fight the extremely skilled Black Widow to a standstill, only losing when the latter resorted to guerrilla tactics to best him in combat. He could swiftly incapacitate Scarlet Witch in close quarters, successfully avoiding her mind manipulation powers. In the Avengers Civil War, he later fought evenly against Black Widow again and was able to swiftly pin her down, but it should be noted that Scarlet Witch interrupted their duel and called Barton out on pulling his punches. He also managed to temporarily hold his own against the considerably stronger Black Panther during the airport fight. Barton also managed to bring down many Chitauri troops and Ultron Sentries while fighting alongside the other Avengers, using his bow and arrows as melee weapons for close quarters. After the Snap, Barton began using a katana, which he integrated seamlessly into his fighting style, and considerably improving his efficiency in close range combat, and demonstrated prowess enough to kill Outriders with it.
Knife Mastery: Barton is highly proficient with knives in close combat, fighting against the skilled Black Widow with his custom dagger. According to his S.H.I.E.L.D. file, he is also trained in throwing knives. Barton can use similar weapons, such as improvising knives with arrows as stabbing weapons, as well as his collapsible shuriken.
Staff Mastery: Barton is highly proficient in wielding a staff or a baton in combat, and using his bow as a melee weapon in the manner of an improvised staff or transforming it into an actual bo staff. He was able to hold himself against Black Panther in the Avengers Civil War which he has shown great skill in wielding it, although he was ultimately being defeated. He also used a collapsible baton against Vision, but his weapon was broken against the synthezoid's exterior.
Sword Mastery: Barton was trained by Jack Duquesne in swordsmanship, resulting in him demonstrating an enormous level of skill with a sword when he went under a samurai-inspired guise. Barton was able to fight on par with Akihiko and easily kill him, combining his melee skills, as well as cut through several Outriders who were rapidly approaching him in conjunction with his Wristbow.
Hawkeye flips over an Ultron Sentry
Master Acrobat: Barton is highly athletic and agile, capable of complex acrobatic maneuvers. Barton was able to react and successfully evade Loki's attacks by jumping out of the way before it hit him. He could also fire a grappling hook arrow and swing through a window, deftly flip off the roof of a car and over an Ultron Sentry, and fire an arrow while jumping backward. During the airport battle, Barton evaded a blast from War Machine mid-air after jumping and rolling onto storage crates. When the New Avengers Facility was attacked, Barton was able to fight off all of the Outriders while scaling upwards, jumping off the walls and even turning and slicing one in half while in mid-air.
Master Spy: Barton is one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s greatest spies, being highly skilled in espionage, intelligence gathering, stealth, infiltration, and sabotage. Nick Fury had him test the Helicarrier's security by breaking inside and accessing the Avengers Initiative database. Under Loki's control, he was able to stealthily eliminate security guards. When his best friend was captured by Ultron, he used his training in espionage to locate her distress signal over the radio. He also easily infiltrated the New Avengers Facility.
Barton slaughtering members of the Yakuza
Master Assassin: Barton is one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s greatest assassins, having once been assigned to kill Black Widow, a notorious master assassin in her own right, and was assigned to be a special agent in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s investigation of the item that was found in New Mexico, having been able to neutralize Thor in the event that Phil Coulson had ordered it. Barton was also able to fight off other assassins such as Marcus Scarlotti, who made a name for himself just by coming close to killing him. While under Loki's mind control, Barton stealthily eliminated the armed security guarding the museum in Stuttgart holding Iridium. Barton also swiftly killed many Chitauri, HYDRA operatives, Ulysses Klaue's mercenaries, Ultron Sentries, and Outriders. After his family's death, Barton dedicated himself to using his ability to murder any criminals that survived the Snap. Barton was able to eliminate a whole gang of Mexican Cartel gangsters without them even being able to pull out their guns in retaliation, a feat which Romanoff initially believed to be the work of an entire rival gang. He was even able to take down numerous enemies who were all firing at him when he targeted the Yakuza, showing his skill in weapons other than archery, such as throwing stars and swords. Barton's killing instinct frightened James Rhodes to the point where he reconsidered trying to find him. Ultimately, he proved his worth alongside the Avengers one last time by effectively killing several Outriders after Thanos demolished the New Avengers Facility.
Gifted Intellect: Nick Fury has referred to Barton as one of the sharpest men he knows during his debriefing of the Tesseract. Barton is highly intelligent, at least on par with Romanoff and Rogers, but not quite as scientifically inclined as Stark or Banner. Regardless, his wife understood the importance of his role on the Avengers, whom he described as "his mess". Barton sees the potential in individuals, as he spared Black Widow and had her defect to S.H.I.E.L.D., and inspired Scarlet Witch to keep fighting.
Master Tactician: Barton was recruited to S.H.I.E.L.D. and had often been put in charge of high level operations due to his leadership abilities, strategic prowess and has been trained in military tactics. Barton was able to command a team of operatives under the unwitting control of Loki to heist a vault in Germany, steal several other raw materials and infiltrate the Helicarrier with esteemed success, often using diversions to accomplish his goals. During the Battle of New York, Stark asked Barton for tactical input on evading Chitauri Chariots. Victoria Hand has even stated that Barton does not usually require an extraction plan on his S.H.I.E.L.D. missions due to his competence and ability to formulate his own escape plans. When tasked with rescuing Wanda Maximoff from the New Avengers Facility, Barton formulated a well orchestrated plan to distract Vision, break into the facility, trap Vision and rescue Maximoff. Barton even had countermeasures in place when the plan didn't go accordingly, which was to get Maximoff to defeat Vision with her abilities.
Expert Pilot: Barton is an accomplished pilot, able to fly a Quinjet even when a fierce battle was going on and even receiving cargo into the Quinjet while piloting it in mid-air. Barton was also the one usually piloting the Avengers Quinjet before he left the team.
Multilingualism: Barton can speak English, Russian, Chinese, Arabic, and Japanese. He also knows Morse code, as he tracked Romanoff's signal in Sokovia.
Equipment
Weapons
Hawkeye nocking an arrow in battle
Recurve Bows: Hawkeye is seen with two separate recurve bows: the first is seen while he is under Loki's mind control and in the direct aftermath at the Battle of New York. It is a heavily customized Hoyt Buffalo in 'blackout' colors and is capable of folding on itself for easier transport and concealment by way of added hinges located by the tiller adjustment bolts. It also has multiple buttons on the bow's grip which are capable of selecting specific arrowheads stored in his mechanical quiver. A laser sight to assist in targeting can also be found on the riser. The second recurve bow Hawkeye uses is the Hoyt Gamemaster II, seen in his hands during the Avengers' attack on the HYDRA Research Base and War against Ultron. Like the Hoyt Buffalo he used before, the customized Gamemaster II has several selector buttons on the grip so Hawkeye can choose the arrowhead he needs. The bow has the capability to transform into a bo staff which can be used for close quarters combat. The bow was destroyed by Black Panther during the Clash of the Avengers. Once he rejoined the Avengers for the Time Heist, he was equipped with a new bow.
Hawkeye equipping his quiver before battle
Specialized Quiver: Hawkeye's quiver was supplied with a multitude of different arrowheads in the bottom. By dialing up an armament setting from control on his bow, Hawkeye could cause the quiver to affix these special arrowheads. This effectively increased the capabilities from conventional arrows to explosive arrows, a grapple line, and more.
Trick Arrows: Hawkeye has a number of trick arrows, utilized to perform specific tasks.
Remington 700PSS: Hawkeye initially reached for his Remington 700PSS sniper rifle when ordered by Phil Coulson to target Thor, although he ultimately chose to use his Mathews Apex 7 compound bow.
Compound Bow: When Thor broke the perimeter S.H.I.E.L.D. had set up around Mjølnir, Hawkeye was one of the agents who responded to Phil Coulson's order to neutralize him. Although Coulson requested that a firearm is used for the job, Hawkeye chose the Mathews Apex 7 compound bow instead. Hawkeye aimed at Thor from an aerial position in a crane but ultimately did not fire.
Wristbow: Hawkeye used once the Wristbow as his weapon during a security exercise to test the security systems of the Helicarrier, where he was disguised as a mercenary who had to battle Natasha Romanoff. Hawkeye used a newer model of the Wristbow during his time after the Snap that contained several smaller arrows that he could fire with ease if he wasn't using his bow.
Barton firing his pistol at Loki
Heckler & Koch P30: Hawkeye carries a Heckler & Koch P30 as his main sidearm, holstered on his left leg during any of his missions. He used it to fire at Loki when he arrived at the Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility, but his rounds had no effect on his Frost Giant durability. He attempted to use it on him again, but was quickly intercepted. After being brainwashed by the God of Mischief, he used it to fire at Nick Fury and at Maria Hill's car while he escaped from the facility with Loki. He still carried it during the Clash of the Avengers, but he kept it holstered not to harm his former allies.
Beretta Cheetah: Barton resorted to using one of these guns to confront Pietro Maximoff at Avengers Tower, shooting it to the glass floor below Maximoff and making him fall to the floor below.
Blades: Hawkeye often carries a blade with him, holstered on his right leg during missions. Hawkeye possessed a dagger made by knife manufacturer Busse, and was made specifically for Hawkeye, with an arrow and bullseye symbol designed on it. Hawkeye used this blade while fighting with Black Widow on board the Helicarrier during his mission to rescue Loki while brainwashed. Hawkeye also had a throwing knife holstered during the Avengers Civil War, although he never used it. He also used a different dagger while operating as Ronin and later during the Time Heist and Battle of Earth.
Hawkeye throwing Captain America's Shield
Captain America's Shield: When the Avengers was initially attacked by Ultron at the Avengers Tower, Barton assisted in the battle by locating Steve Rogers' shield and throwing it at him, so Rogers could then finally destroy the last remaining Ultron Sentry.
Arrow Case: Hawkeye uses an arrow cartridge capable of holding nine collapsible arrows. He stores a case on the outside of each leg, which easily comes off and quickly expand the nine arrows.
Baton: Barton carried a collapsible metal baton hidden under his quiver. He tried to use it to attack Vision, but it shattered in half against the android's Vibranium skin once he had increased his density.
Hawkeye swiftly slicing an Outrider in half
Katana: Going under a different guise after the Snap, Barton started using a different an assortment of weaponry, similar to that of a samurai, including wielding a katana when going around killing criminals who survived. Barton continued to wield the katana when he was reunited with the Avengers, fighting against Thanos and his army.
Shuriken: Going under a different guise after the Snap, Barton started using a different an assortment of weaponry, similar to that of a samurai, including shuriken when going around killing criminals who survived. Barton used this weapon to throw at enemies that were not at close range.
Other Equipment
Ankle Monitor: Due to Barton violating the Sokovia Accords, he had an ankle monitor while being placed under house arrest at his homestead by the FBI.
Uniforms
S.H.I.E.L.D. Uniform: Hawkeye's first uniform, worn when he was working with S.H.I.E.L.D., consisted of a black short-sleeved shirt with two breast pockets and pants with knee guards. It also has a thigh holster on his left leg. When using his bow, he wore a glove on his left hand and an arm guard on his right forearm. Hawkeye wore this while under the control of Loki when he attacked the Helicarrier.

Tactical Uniform: The second uniform was worn during missions for S.H.I.E.L.D. as apart of STRIKE Team: Delta. It is a black sleeveless suit with a maroon arrow pattern and a zip down the front. It also has a S.H.I.E.L.D. logo on the right breast. It has a finger glove on his left hand and an arm guard on his right forearm. He would keep this suit during his time as an Avenger but with no S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.
Masked Uniform: The third uniform was worn when Barton was assigned by Nick Fury to break into the Helicarrier and access the Avengers Initiative database in order to test its security. He sported a fully black uniform with a black mask and green goggles to cover his identity. To maintain maneuverability, the uniform only has a Wristbow attached to his right arm.
Winter Uniform: The fourth uniform was the same as his tactical one but with a coat over it with the same black and maroon pattern. The coat has a zip that goes from the top to the middle, with a long skirt in the front. This was worn during missions in cold weather due to his Tactical Uniform having no sleeves. Hawkeye used this uniform during the War on HYDRA, due to the location of the bases being in cold environments. Hawkeye later wore the uniform again during the Battle of Sokovia, but took off the jacket when the city was raised into the atmosphere.
Stealth Uniform: The fifth uniform was a different design from his previous ones. It is black with a purple tinge. There is a sleeve on his right arm with a glove, while only a finger glove and arm guard on his left arm. It also has a thigh holster on his left leg. Hawkeye used this suit when breaking into the New Avengers Facility, utilizing it's more subtle, darker look to go in unnoticed. He then kept this uniform during the Avengers Civil War.
Ronin Uniform:      Barton wears his Ronin Uniform in Tokyo   The sixth uniform resembled that of a samurai, with a primarily black suit with gold outlines throughout it. It features a black mask with a gap over the eyes, a hood, and armor on the arms and legs. There is a belt that contains his smaller, projectile weapons, as well as a back holster for his katana.

Avengers Uniform: The seventh uniform was worn when Barton reunited with the Avengers for the Time Heist, which was an altered version of the Ronin Uniform with a slimmer style without the gold armor, mask and hood. Barton kept his katana and projectiles, but also returned to his Hawkeye moniker with a new bow and quiver and a finger glove and Wristbow on his left hand.
Advanced Tech Suit: This suit was designed in order to time travel through the Quantum Realm safely. It is a white, red and black suit that materialize around the wearer's regular clothes, managing to be summoned when time travel is required again, and disappear when no longer in use. It has size-shifting adaptability down to subatomic levels and a wrist gadget that allows for displacement through time and space.
Vehicles
Hawkeye flying the Quinjet in New York
Quinjet: Hawkeye has used a Quinjet for transportation to travel around the world and take out threats during active missions as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and as a member of the Avengers. When Loki attacked New York, Hawkeye told Captain America that he could pilot a Quinjet and flew him and Black Widow to the battle, where he assisted taking out multiple Chitauri Chariots until it was shot down by Loki. When the Avengers were assaulting HYDRA bases, Hawkeye flew them into battle and later to the Salvage Yard to apprehend Ultron. Hawkeye flew the Quinjet to his farmhouse and later piloted it to assist during the Battle of Seoul, successfully obtaining the Regeneration Cradle when it became airborne. Hawkeye would then fly all the Avengers to Sokovia to put an end to Ultron's plans. When his family was returned from the Blip, Hawkeye took a Quinjet to fly back to his home to be reunited with them.
Jeep: During the Destruction of Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S., Loki stole the Tesseract and brainwashed Hawkeye and Erik Selvig into serving him. The three of them fled the scene in a Jeep they stole with Loki sitting in the back. During the Attack on the HYDRA Research Base, Barton and Black Widow used a Jeep to fight the HYDRA soldiers and move around faster. When all the Avengers regrouped to attack the HYDRA soldiers, Black Widow crashed the jeep as she and Hawkeye jumped out to continue fighting on foot.
Benatar: During the Time Heist, Hawkeye and Black Widow were assigned to go to Vormir, so Hawkeye was given the Benatar, which was shrunken down, to use to get to the planet. Once Nebula separated the Space Pod from the ship on Morag in 2014, Hawkeye and Black Widow entered the ship and headed to Vormir, where Nebula had set in the coordinates, leaving them to just fly the ship to the planet. When the mission was complete, Hawkeye returned the ship to the present day.
Facilities
Barton returns back home to see his children
Clint Barton's Homestead: When Barton joined S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury ensured his family's existence would be a secret, set up a farm for them to live. After being defeated by Wanda Maximoff, Barton brought the Avengers to his home so they could recover. When Nick Fury arrived and motivated the Avengers, Barton made a promise to his wife that he would retire from the Avengers. Barton kept his promise and proceeded to spend time with his family, including his new born child Nathaniel Barton. After the Avengers Civil War, when Barton escaped from the Raft, instead of being a fugitive, Barton decided to make an agreement with Thaddeus Ross so he would go under house arrest for two years.
S.H.I.E.L.D. Crater Investigation Site: Barton was called in to New Mexico to provide some extra security at an 0-8-4 when taking his first vacation since joining S.H.I.E.L.D.. While there, an intruder attempted to make his way to the 0-8-4, Barton was instructed to take a vantage point above. Barton, wielding his bow, proceeded to obtain a position above, waiting for the order to take the shot. Barton, along with the rest of the S.H.I.E.L.D. team, departed from New Mexico after the 0-8-4 had been removed by the previous intruder.
Hawkeye and Nick Fury witness Loki's arrival
Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility: Barton was called by Nick Fury to guard the Tesseract at their main facility of Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S.. When the Tesseract began to act up, Fury arrived at the facility, where Barton gave his report, including the theory that the Tesseract could be activated from a secondary location. His theory was proven to be right when Loki arrived and attacked the facility. The facility began to collapse on itself and Barton was enthralled by Loki. Barton, under Loki's control, assisted him in escaping with the Tesseract.
Loki's Hideout: Under Loki's control, Barton provided him with a facility that wouldn't be able to be uncovered by S.H.I.E.L.D.. As Erik Selvig used the facility to work on a device to stabilize the portal, Barton, who had recruited enemies of S.H.I.E.L.D., proceeded to search for various raw materials to build the device. At the facility, Barton informed Loki of everything he needed to know about the Avengers.
Barton along with the rest of the Avengers
Avengers Tower: After the collapse of S.H.I.E.L.D., Tony Stark decided to fund the Avengers, redesigning Stark Tower as a new headquarter for the team. After being injured during an attack on HYDRA, the team returned to the tower, where Barton was tended to by Helen Cho using the Regeneration Cradle. Afterward, the Avengers held a party at the tower which fell under attack by a newly created Ultron. The Avengers then proceeded to search for Ultron in the tower, going through their files until they came across Ulysses Klaue.
New Avengers Facility: After being brought in by Natasha Romanoff, Barton went to the Avengers Facility, where he and the other Avengers planned on how to go back in time and reverse the effects of the snap. Barton was present at the facility when it was destroyed by Thanos when he traveled through time to kill the Avengers.
