<html><p>Falcon found Black Widow in her stand off with Crossbones' last two mercenaries who threatened to smash the biological weapon. Falcon used Redwing to shoot one mercenary, while Black Widow killed the other and caught the biological weapon, as Falcon had insisted she thank Redwing. Meanwhile, Captain America fought Crossbones as he attempted to kill him with his bomb vest, only for Scarlet Witch to inadvertently throw him into a building, killing dozens of civilians.

Avengers Civil War
Sokovia Accords
Wilson attends a meeting with Thaddeus Ross
In the direct aftermath of the disastrous mission in Lagos, the newly appointed Secretary of State, Thaddeus Ross came to visit the New Avengers Facility. Wilson sat with the rest of the team as Ross told them how, following a massive heart attack, he had gained a whole new perspective over the world, noting how the world had owed the Avengers an unpayable debt, but he viewed them as dangerous vigilantes, commenting on how they were enhanced individuals who seemed to have little regard for the destruction they left behind.

Wilson first learns about the Sokovia Accords
Ross demonstrated his point by showing the high civilian death tolls connected with the Avengers' missions in New York City and Sokovia while they fought against Loki and Ultron, with their recent disaster in Lagos during their fight against Crossbones, it had been decided that they needed to be put under closer checks. Ross presented Wilson with the recently written Sokovia Accords, which Ross had explained meant the United Nations would have control over the Avengers.

Wilson and James Rhodes having their debate
Once Ross had left the New Avengers Facility, Wilson and the other Avengers began discussing the Accords and whether they should be accepted, as he spoke to James Rhodes who was arguing that Ross' military record should give him more credibility. While Wilson argued that there was a risk they would be sent to the Raft if they disobeyed the Accords, to which Rhodes then noted that with the support of the hundred and seventeen countries, the Accords should be obeyed.

Wilson listening to the Avengers' arguments
The debate was interrupted by Vision who proposed an equation, as Wilson mocked this. Wilson listened while Vision made the point that following Tony Stark announcing that he was Iron Man, the number of enhanced individuals and world threatening events had skyrocketed, claiming that the Avengers' presence would always invite challenges. While Rhodes had believed all this supported his arguments, Natasha Romanoff invited Tony Stark to make his own case for the Accords.

Wilson listening to all Tony Stark's arguments
Wilson listened while Stark had told them about Charlie Spencer and how he was killed in Sokovia while they had fought Ultron. Stark told the Avengers that they had needed to be put in check, ensuring that people like Spencer did not lose their lives, as Wilson listened while Stark and Steve Rogers debated the potential ramifications from this and if they could be forced into it, with Scarlet Witch fearing that their governments could potentially attempt to arrest her for her actions.

Wilson questions Natasha Romanoff's choice
To the great surprise of Wilson, Romanoff also spoke out about her support for the Accords, as Wilson reminded her about how she had turned against the Department of Defense in the wake of the HYDRA Uprising. As Stark claimed that he won the debate, Wilson then saw Rogers getting the message that Peggy Carter had died. Wilson's decision to not sign the Accords had then resulted with him receiving an honorable discharge from the United States Armed Forces.

Peggy Carter's Funeral
Wilson attending the funeral of Peggy Carter
Wilson had accompanied Steve Rogers for Peggy Carter's funeral in the United Kingdom. As they had taken their seats, Wilson had then noticed that Sharon Carter was giving a speech, revealing herself as Peggy's niece. Wilson listened to Carter's speech in which she described her time growing up with the Strategic Scientific Reserve's head, and described the lessons learned from her aunt, making both Wilson and Rogers consider the Sokovia Accords' decision.

Wilson and Steve Rogers making their toast
Once the funeral was over, Wilson joined Rogers in a London pub, as they made the toast to both being given an honorable discharge from the Avengers. Rogers had then questioned if Wilson was doing okay following their decision, although he insisted that he was, claiming that he would make for a great civilian. Looking over the bar, Wilson saw that Carter was also there, as he suggested that Rogers should go and speak to her, which Rogers finally did.

Wilson warns Steve Rogers and Sharon Carter
Wilson had then allowed Rogers and Carter time alone to catch up. However, when a bomb was detonated just outside from the Vienna International Centre where the Accords were getting signed. Wilson had then informed Rogers and Carter of the situation, as they then watched the news report which informed them that King T'Chaka of Wakanda had been killed in that explosion, and that their authorities had suspected the Winter Soldier was responsible for the attack.

Finding Bucky Barnes
Wilson agreeing to help locate Bucky Barnes
The three traveled into Vienna to investigate. While Steve Rogers had returned from his conversation with Natasha Romanoff, Wilson asked him if Romanoff told him not to interfere, but Rogers had still insisted that Bucky Barnes would do the same for him, with Wilson noting that maybe in 1945, but this was not the case. Carter joined them, as she explained to them that Barnes had just been located in Bucharest. However, she also noted that the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre's leader, Everett Ross, was also targeting Barnes, with a kill order.

Falcon flies towards an attacking helicopter
In Bucharest, Falcon observed that GSG 9 soldiers were approaching their location. As Captain America talked with Barnes in his apartment, Falcon updated him on the soldiers positions. Captain America and Barnes then fought against the soldiers and escaped, but Black Panther arrived, and attempted to kill Barnes. Falcon was asked to take care of the GSG 9 helicopter which was shooting at them, so Falcon then smashed into the side of it.

Falcon getting attacked by the Black Panther
Their battle continued through the road tunnel, with GSG 9 soldiers chasing the three with their vehicles. Falcon flew after his allies, using the EXO-7 Falcon's speed and agility to catch up with them, so Captain America had then asked Falcon to help him shake Black Panther, who was refusing to give up on his quest to kill Barnes. Falcon flew through the tunnel as he caught Black Panther in mid air, only for Black Panther to use it to his benefit.

Falcon is surrounded and arrested by agents
Black Panther used Falcon's speed to catch up with his prey, before Falcon braked when Barnes used his grenades to explode the tunnel entrance, launching Black Panther forward. Black Panther caught Barnes, but was kept from killing him by Captain America before the GSG 9 arrested all of them, with the help of War Machine. Once he removed his helmet, Falcon then discovered that Black Panther was actually T'Challa, the prince of Wakanda.

Held by Everett Ross
Wilson mocks T'Challa's panther uniform
While GSG 9 agents were transporting the four individuals to the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre's headquarters in Berlin, Wilson insults T'Challa over his suit, asking if he liked cats, despite the efforts of Steve Rogers to make him stop, knowing that he'll make the situation worse. Remaining serious about their situation, T'Challa had then calmly explained to them that the Panther Habit is made of vibranium, and his reasons for attacking Bucky Barnes was due to Barnes seemingly killing his father during a terrorist attack, promising that he would eventually kill him.

Wilson having his EXO-7 Falcon taken away
As they arrived, they were greeted by Sharon Carter, who introduced them to Everett Ross, the head of the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre, who was waiting for them. Ross had refused to give them any clear information about what would happen to Barnes, before he informed the group that all their gear would be confiscated until further notice, causing Wilson to grumble that he better would not see anybody else using the EXO-7 Falcon while he was still waiting to get it back.

Wilson and Steve Rogers follow Everett Ross
With Barnes being taken away into another room for a psychological evaluation, conducted by Theo Broussard, Wilson, along with Rogers and T'Challa were led through their facility by Ross, who noted that they would be given offices rather than prison cells. They were then joined by Natasha Romanoff, who had expressed her displeasure at seeing the situation, since she had already warned Rogers not to get involved, although Rogers had noted that they saved Barnes' life.

Wilson and Rogers are stopped by Tony Stark
Wilson and Rogers had eventually come across Tony Stark, who was speaking to Thaddeus Ross, and made it clear that there would now be serious consequences for their actions in protecting Barnes, as he wanted them both sent to the Raft. Stark had also noted that Wilson would not get his wings, while Rogers would not get his shield, much to his dismay as he then called the decision completely cold-hearted, while Stark had then noted that it was at least warmer than any jail.

Wilson watching Bucky Barnes' interrogation
Wilson joined Rogers and Carter as they watched the interview of the contained Barnes by the psychoanalyst Broussard, with Carter then handing Wilson the receipt for his suit, which Wilson had complained about as the receipt listed his EXO-7 Falcon as the bird costume. As they were all watching the interrogation about those terrorist attacks, Rogers suspected an ulterior motive behind releasing Barnes' picture to the public, questioning Carter about why this had happened.

Wilson discussing Bucky Barnes being found
Although Wilson reminded him that they had searched for Barnes for two years and had failed to find him anywhere, but Rogers noted that they had not bombed the United Nations which had drawn attention. Hearing all this, Wilson and Carter began to catch up to what Rogers was thinking, as they then realized that somebody might have been attempting to get closer to Barnes, as they looked up at their screen, becoming suspicious of the man who was interrogating Barnes.

Winter Soldier's Escape
Wilson and Steve Rogers locate Helmut Zemo
Suddenly, the power across the entire facility was then cut out, which had ignited panic across the base since their camera feed to Bucky Barnes' interrogation was also cut out. Once Sharon Carter told them where to go, Wilson and Steve Rogers quickly hurried down into the interrogation room, where they found several men lying unconscious on the ground, before finding their psycho-analyst, Helmut Zemo, on the ground without Barnes, before Rogers had then immediately confronted Zemo.

Wilson being ambushed by the Winter Soldier
While Rogers then questioned Zemo about what he actually wanted, Barnes revealed he was free from his cell and had been brainwashed back to his Winter Soldier programming. The Winter Soldier attacked Wilson and had attempted to crush his neck with his prosthetic arm. However, Wilson had managed to get free from the Winter Soldier's grip, before he was then knocked unconscious as the Winter Soldier threw him backwards before then furiously fighting against Rogers.

Wilson watches Helmut Zemo trying to escape
Once Wilson had woken back up from the Winter Soldier's attack, he had then spotted that Zemo was looking down an elevator shaft that Rogers had been thrown down. Fearing that he would be attempting to make his escape, Wilson had called after Zemo, only for him who begin running away from the Avenger. Wilson then ran after him and followed him up the stairs until they made it outside, all the while with a fight breaking out between the Winter Soldier and the security.

Wilson failing to stop Helmut Zemo's escape
However, Wilson then lost sight of Zemo outside the building where he had disappeared into the crowds of people who were running for their lives in the chaos, only being able to find Zemo's jacket which he had left behind to help him get away. Wilson later regrouped with Rogers, who had managed to capture the Winter Soldier when they had both been thrown from the roof of the headquarters while in his helicopter, which the Winter Soldier had attempted to escape in.

Going on the Run
Wilson watches Bucky Barnes as he wakes up
With their battle now over, Wilson and Steve Rogers had then taken a unconscious Bucky Barnes into an abandoned building where they then subdued him by trapping his prosthetic arm in the vice. Once Barnes awoke, they questioned if he was still under mind control, as Barnes revealed he was safe by noting key facts about his and Rogers' childhood and Rogers' mother, although Wilson had still remained skeptical that this was actually proof that Barnes was no longer a danger to them, although Rogers assured him it was okay.

Wilson awaiting answers about Helmut Zemo
To his horror, Barnes realized what he had done as the programming that HYDRA put in his mind was still there, and Helmut Zemo simply had to do was say the codewords to reactivate him. Wilson stood by as Rogers had questioned Barnes about who Zemo was, noting that Zemo had killed multiple people in his attacks to get close to Barnes. Thinking for a moment, Barnes then noted that Zemo had asked him about the Facility in Siberia where he had been kept for decades.

Wilson learns about the other Winter Soldiers
As Wilson listened, Barnes explained that there were multiple Winter Soldiers, and that they were likely Zemo's target. Wilson checked if the Soldiers had also turned out like Barnes after being injected with the Super Soldier Serum, as Barnes explained that they had turned out even worse. They then realized that if Zemo gained control of the soldiers, he could use them to infiltrate and completely destabilize an entire country overnight without anybody seeing them coming.

Wilson recommending they recruit Ant-Man
Having seemingly figured out Zemo's plans, Wilson and Rogers then deliberated their course of action; noting that because of the Sokovia Accords the situation had become more complicated. While Rogers suggested they call Tony Stark for assistance, Wilson noted that he would not go against those Accords, meaning that they were on their own. However, Wilson then considered Ant-Man, noting that he knew a guy who could potentially assist them with defeating Zemo.

Building The Team
Wilson and Bucky Barnes meet Sharon Carter
With the help of Sharon Carter, the group went on the run. Carter met them and revealed that she had gone behind Everett Ross' back and gave them their equipment back. While Steve Rogers spoke with Carter, Wilson remained in their car with Bucky Barnes, rudely refusing to move his seat to give Barnes more leg room, since he still dislikes him from their pervious battles. After Rogers had kissed Carter as she left, both Wilson and Barnes smiled approvingly at their friend's success with Carter, much to Rogers' great embarrassment.

Wilson and Steve Rogers greet Clint Barton
Wilson, Rogers and Barnes then reunited with Clint Barton, who was with Wanda Maximoff near to Leipzig-Halle Airport, as Barton made it clear to them that he was happy to assist them by breaking Maximoff out of the New Avengers Facility, before welcoming Scott Lang to the team. While Wilson had watched on awkwardly, Lang expressed his excitement at meeting Rogers and these other heroes, as he thanked Rogers for inviting him onto the team and touching his muscles.

Wilson welcoming Scott Lang onto their team
Lang then happily greeted Wilson as he also attempted to apologize for their previous encounter at the New Avengers Facility where Lang had defeated Wilson during the clash. However, Wilson cut off Lang's sentence, insisting that their clash had merely been Lang's audition into the Avengers, and also claimed that he would never allow that to happen again, before Rogers brought Lang up to date about Helmut Zemo and the Winter Soldiers, noting they were against the law.

Wilson and the team prepare for their mission
Once Lang agreed to join them on their mission, the team prepared to get moving as Barton noted that they had a helicopter ready to get them out of Germany. However, they then heard alarms being set off, which Barnes confirmed meant that the airport was being evacuated, as Wilson noted that this was likely Tony Stark arriving to bring them into custody. Rogers ordered the team to suit up, as Wilson donned his EXO-7 Falcon and joined his allies in attempting to escape.

Clash of the Avengers
Falcon manages to locate Iron Man's Quinjet
While Captain America allowed himself to be cornered and disarmed by Iron Man's team of heroes, Falcon took position further away from their confrontation and scanned the airport. As Captain America was keeping Iron Man distracted, Falcon sent Redwing to scan the airport, and eventually found the Quinjet that Iron Man's team had then arrived with in Hangar 5, using his Combat Goggles. Falcon then alerted Captain America, revealing to Iron Man's team the rest of the various rebels as they all had begun running towards the Quinjet.

Falcon commenting on Spider-Man's gimmick
Falcon and Winter Soldier then made their way towards the hangar, while Captain America had kept Black Panther from catching up with them and attempting to kill the Winter Soldier. As they had run, they saw that Spider-Man was following them, as Falcon noted with some frustration that all heroes had gimmicks nowadays. Spider-Man then attacked with a kick against Falcon, before then engaging the Winter Soldier, being amazed by his metal arm while Falcon recovered.

Falcon scraps with Spider-Man through the air
Falcon recovered from the kick and flew back into the fight, knocking Spider-Man away from the Winter Soldier as the two started to battle through the airport's terminal, as Spider-Man was attempting to take Falcon into his custody. Falcon fought Spider-Man in the air, shooting missiles at him, while the Winter Soldier tried to throw heavy objects at him, only for them to discover that Spider-Man was able to predict their movements and counter them while making snarky comments.

Falcon is webbed to the railing by Spider-Man
Although Falcon was able to catch Spider-Man by surprise, and kick him off a platform, Spider-Man swiftly recovered as he flipped behind Falcon, and using his Synthetic Webbing to then damage the EXO-7 Falcon, causing Falcon to crash land, using his Web-Shooters to trap him against the railing. With Falcon now webbed up to that handrail, Spider-Man then asked if his wings were made from Carbon-Fibre, to which Falcon had questioned if the webbing came out of his body.

Falcon and Winter Soldier are webbed down
While Falcon recommended that he focus more on the fight than the conversation, Spider-Man lunged towards Falcon to knock him to the floor, only for the kick to be intercepted by the Winter Soldier, which knocked them both off the platform. Spider Man webbed the two to the floor, but before he could do any more damage, Falcon had then controlled Redwing to take Spider-Man out from the terminal, leaving him and the Winter Soldier on the floor, still insulting each other.

Falcon runs beside Captain America's team
Having regrouped back with their team, Falcon then ran towards the Quinjet's Hangar in order to escape, only to be stopped by the laser beam blasted by Vision, who had then implored their team who were against the Sokovia Accords to surrender now before it was too late. They refused and the two opposing sides had charged towards each other, picking up an individual fight with Falcon tackling War Machine in the air. When Vision then tried to attack Falcon, he was stopped by an electric arrow shot from Hawkeye, helping Falcon to fly away.

Falcon being chased around by War Machine
Falcon was later chased down by both Iron Man and War Machine as they used their combined weapons to try and knock him out from the sky, to which Falcon asked Hawkeye for some assistance. Hawkeye teamed up with Ant-Man to help Falcon and stop Iron Man, shooting his scatter arrow with Ant-Man riding it, which had then allowed Ant-Man to enter in the Iron Man Armor, therefore stopping Iron Man from chasing Falcon further since Ant-Man disabled it from the inside.

Winning a Losing Battle
Falcon agrees to allow himself to be captured
As their fight between the Avengers continued, Falcon and their team had then realized that not all of them could win and get to Siberia, as Falcon noted this was not their real fight as Captain America needed to find Helmut Zemo. Falcon, while he was being chased around the airport by War Machine, suggested that they make a diversion so Captain America and the Winter Soldier could attempt to reach the Quinjet, as Ant-Man then volunteered to make a big distraction.

Falcon attacking Iron Man during their conflict
While admitting that this distraction could result in him being torn in half, Ant-Man then told them to wait for the signal and jumped onto War Machine's back while he was still chasing down Falcon. All of a sudden, Ant-Man grew to an enormous size and caught War Machine in mid-air, signaling the diversion. Witnessing this remarkable feat by his ally, Falcon had complimented GiAnt-Man, before then smashing straight into Iron Man, who had become distracted by the event.

Falcon shooting Redwing directly at Iron Man
While Captain America and the Winter Soldier used the distraction of GiAnt-Man tearing through the airport to allow them to run towards the Quinjet, Falcon had scrapped with Iron Man in mid air, to ensure he did not realize what was happening, although Black Panther was chasing them down. Falcon quickly disengaged his wings to perform a freefall as he launched Redwing, which flew directly into Iron Man's helmet, stunning him as Falcon re-activated his wings and flew off.

Falcon chases Iron Man and War Machine
As Captain America and the Winter Soldier had made it onboard the Quinjet, Iron Man and War Machine were behind them attempting to stop their mission. Witnessing this, Falcon flew after them as he tried to shoot his missiles to distract War Machine and protect the Quinjet. However, when Falcon saw Vision's shooting his laser beams at him, deactivated the EXO-7 Falcon to avoid the blast. The beam, however, hit War Machine's Arc Reactor, disabling the suit, causing him to fall.

Falcon witnesses War Machine's near death
War Machine fell helplessly thousands of feet to the ground, despite Falcon and Iron Man's efforts to save him. Although he survived, but Rhodes was left paralyzed by the impact. Falcon was shocked for his mistake, he told Stark that he was sorry, but Stark, enraged, had fired his repulsor blast at Falcon, knocking him unconscious and signalling the end of their clash, with Falcon then being put under arrest, under the direct orders of Secretary Thaddeus Ross, as well as Stark.

Imprisoned in the Raft
Wilson is visited by Tony Stark inside the Raft
Following their defeat during the Clash of the Avengers, Wilson and his allies were imprisoned in the Raft under the orders of Thaddeus Ross. While they sat in the cells, Wilson had watched on as Tony Stark came to visit them, only to be mocked by Clint Barton for his actions, while Stark had insisted they were there for breaking the rules of the Sokovia Accords, before Stark went to speak with Wilson.

Wilson being questioned about Steve Rogers
While Stark ignored Scott Lang's attempts to mock him, Wilson had asked about James Rhodes' condition, as Stark assured him that he was going to alright now that he was getting treatment. As Stark had questioned where Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes had gone, Wilson refused to give them up, only for Stark to shut down the audio in the prison. Stark showed Wilson an image of Theo Broussard lying dead, before noting that Broussard was meant to interrogate Barnes.

Wilson assists Tony Stark to find Steve Rogers
Acknowledging that Helmut Zemo had deceived him, Stark admitted that he was wrong, noting that Rogers was going to need all the help he could get with stopping Zemo and their Winter Soldiers. Agreeing to help him, Wilson told Stark that Rogers and Barnes were heading to the HYDRA Facility in Siberia, but had also insisted that Stark had to go there alone, and with his intention only being of helping Rogers as his friend, which Stark had agreed to as he departed the Raft.

Wilson is freed from the Raft by Steve Rogers
While Wilson remained locked up in the Raft, he was eventually freed when Rogers broke inside and released him, along with Barton, Lang and Wanda Maximoff. Once freed, Barton, Lang and Maximoff had decided to return to their homes, while Wilson agreed to remain with Rogers. Having been rejoined by Natasha Romanoff, the team met with Nick Fury, and then assisted in his underground mission to track terrorist cells in Syria who used Chitauri fuelled weapons.

Infinity War
Rescue of Vision
Falcon battling the Black Order members
Having been warned by Bruce Banner that Thanos would be sending down the Black Order to Earth in order to claim the remaining Infinity Stones, Falcon and his allies had travelled to Edinburgh, Scotland in order to protect Vision. Their team arrived just as Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive were still attempting to rip the Mind Stone from Vision's head. Once Vision and Wanda Maximoff were beaten down, Captain America had then intercepted the Black Order's attack and distracted Midnight, allowing Falcon to fly into the battle and attacked.

Falcon threatening to shoot Proxima Midnight
Falcon flew straight into the fight, and smashed straight into Midnight while she was distracted by Captain America's arrival, knocking her through a shop window. Falcon then began firing his EXO-7 Falcon's missiles at Glaive, who managed to block these missiles but failed to notice Black Widow running at him, as she had proceeded to wound Glaive with Midnight's Spear. With Glaive wounded, Falcon had then charged directly into Midnight and aimed his Twin Guns at them.

Falcon witnesses the Black Order's escape
With these Black Order members now defeated, Falcon kept his twin guns aimed at them, while Black Widow warned that they would be willing to kill them if they had to. However, Midnight insisted that they would never get the chance again, as she activated her teleporter as she and Glaive were taken back onboard their Q-Ship, ripping their weapons out of Captain America's hands while Midnight and Glaive escaped, leaving Falcon and his allies to then check on Vision, as he had been badly wounded by Glaive during the sudden attack.

Falcon helping out Vision following his attack
As Falcon and Maximoff helped Vision back to his feet, they had discovered that his Vibranium body was damaged. Knowing Thanos' Black Order would attempt to destroy Vision again to take the Mind Stone, Falcon helped him onboard the Quinjet so they could take him to safety. Onboard, Falcon questioned where they would be going, as Captain America told him that they would go to the New Avengers Facility, for the first time ever since the Avengers had fallen apart.

Reunited with Friends
Wilson returns into the New Avengers Facility
Taken Vision to get medical aid following his injuries, and to protect him from the Black Order's attacks, Wilson piloted their Quinjet and flew back to the New Avengers Facility. When they had arrived with Vision, Wilson and the rest of the team had then found James Rhodes speaking with Thaddeus Ross via a hologram. Although Ross demanded that Wilson and the rest of their team be arrested for going against the Sokovia Accords, Rhodes instead cut off the call.

Wilson witnesses the return of Bruce Banner
As Ross had been removed from the room, Rhodes then greeted the team, as he commented that they looked bad, to which Wilson then replied that all the hotels they had been staying in had not been five stars. However, Bruce Banner had then revealed that he was also in there, since Banner had reunited with Natasha Romanoff for the first time since their Ultron Offensive. Watching their reunion, Wilson had then jokingly commented on the awkwardness of the situation.

Wilson discussing all Thanos' recent attacks
Wilson then joined the rest of the Avengers as they discussed what was to be done in order to protect Vision and also stop Thanos from obtaining the Mind Stone in his quest to find all these Infinity Stones. Eventually, it was decided that the best option for them was to take Vision to Wakanda, where they could recruit the aid of Shuri to then remove the Mind Stone from Vision's head, while keeping him alive, so they could destroy the Stone and keep it away from Thanos.

Arriving in Wakanda
Wilson piloting the Quinjet over to Wakanda
Intending to remove the Mind Stone from Vision before it was too late, Wilson flew the Avengers to Africa on their Quinjet. As they had approached their entrance to Wakanda, Wilson was advised by Steve Rogers on how to enter the hidden city, as Wilson had remained nervous about seemingly flying directly into a forest, only for the Quinjet to pass through all of their secret cloaking systems and to the African city of Wakanda, while Wilson had then landed the Quinjet.

Wilson observing the dropships in the sky
As soon the Avengers had landed on Wakanda, Rogers was greeted by King T'Challa, thanking him for agreeing to help them. Wilson had followed their teams, with the Dora Milaje, and witnessed the team's preparation for the Black Order's return. While he waited for the team with Bucky Barnes, Wilson had then observed the sky as the Outrider Dropship started to land on the dome of Wakanda. Wilson contacted the team for their notice, resulting in preparation for their battle.

Battle of Wakanda
Falcon flying above the armies of Wakanda
With Thanos' forces arriving outside Wakanda, Falcon flew into the position with the Avengers and Wakanda's armies. Staying in the air, Falcon witnessed their attempts to force Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian to surrender fail, as Midnight had instead unleashed hordes of the Outriders from their Dropships, who then furiously charged towards their armies, only for them to be torn apart by Wakanda's shields upon impact.

Falcon firing at the many attacking Outriders
However, several of these Outriders managed to break through the shields, despite their flesh being torn off, as they charged forwards. In order to keep them away from their armies, Falcon flew above the Outriders and fired his Twin Guns at them, before then shooting out his Redwings to cut through the Outriders. With too many Outriders breaking through, War Machine advised Falcon to fly away before then dropping several massive bombs on top of these Outriders, as this caused a massive explosion but failed to stop the Outriders.

Falcon and War Machine destroy the Thresher
Despite keeping these Outriders away, it was discovered that several were attempting to get behind them to attack Vision and Shuri, which had forced Black Panther to open their barriers in keep the Outriders' attention on them. With the Outriders charging into Wakanda, Falcon flew into the fight, until Thor had arrived with Rocket Raccoon as well as Groot to assist them. Falcon and War Machine then team up once again to take out the Threshers as they charged through the battle.

Falcon seeing Corvus Glaive attacking Vision
Although the battle was beginning to turn their way, Falcon had then seen on his Combat Goggles that Vision was now being attacked by Corvus Glaive, who took advantage of Scarlet Witch joining the battle on the front lines. Falcon informed their team about this, only for him to be knocked out of the sky by an Outrider, while Bruce Banner and Scarlet Witch both volunteered to go to the aid of Vision, in order to ensure Glaive could not steal the Mind Stone out of his head.

Thanos' Victory
Falcon noticing Thanos' entrance in Wakanda
Eventually, the entire army of Outriders were beaten back, while the members of the Black Order had been killed, which ended the battle and had seemingly left the Avengers victorious. However, before the team could celebrate this victory, they had then witnessed the arrival of Thanos through a wormhole. Realizing that Vision was once again out in the open and in great danger, Falcon and the other Avengers readied themselves for the fight, while Thanos had calmly walked towards his target.

Falcon desperately attempts to shoot Thanos
However, it swiftly became clear that Thanos was considerably more powerful than any of the Avengers, as he then used the power of the five Infinity Stones he had collected to entrap Bruce Banner in a wall, before easily subduing Black Panther and Captain America. Falcon tried to stop him by shooting his Twin Guns at the Mad Titan, but he was hopelessly outclassed by Thanos' power, as Falcon was taken out after Thanos had used the Space Stone to knock him down.

Falcon being faded away into dust by Thanos
With Falcon out of the fight, the other Avengers all found themselves outmatched, as Thanos ripped the Mind Stone out of Vision's head. Once Thanos has assembled all of the Infinity Stones into the Infinity Gauntlet, he was intercepted by Thor, but was still able to then snap his fingers, resulting in the decimation of half of the population of the universe. Falcon disintegrated into ashes as he crawled through long grass while James Rhodes called out to him, trying to find him.

Battle of Earth
Falcon returns to join the battle
In the five years following Falcon's death, the surviving Avengers had undertaken the mission to go back through time to reclaim the Infinity Stones and resurrect the victims of the Snap. Once these Stones were collected, Bruce Banner had successfully managed to snap everyone back into existence, while Falcon was revived along with the trillions of others who were killed in that first Snap. Falcon had then radioed in to Captain America, revealing to him that he was alive, as he said "On your left".

Falcon flying towards Thanos' entire army
Captain America had watched on as an Inter-Dimensional Portal was opened up from Wakanda, and Falcon flew through and prepared to fight along with the rest of their resurrected Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and various other heroes who were disintegrated in the Snap, all then emerging from numerous portals opened up by Doctor Strange, Wong, and their Masters of the Mystic Arts, while they stood together against Thanos and his armies of Chitauri and Outriders.

Falcon uses his wings to kill a Chitauri Gorilla
Falcon then stood behind Captain America, who had led the charge against Thanos' army. Falcon flew towards their opposing army and fought them, mostly sticking to the air during the fight, putting down gunfire from above. When Hawkeye was being chased by a Chitauri Gorilla, Falcon proceeded to fly in and had knocked down the Gorilla onto its back, before stabbing it with his EXO-7 Falcon wings, killing the Gorilla, as Falcon continued fighting against Thanos' armies.

Falcon witnesses the arrival of Captain Marvel
As the battle continued, Thanos was almost killed by Scarlet Witch, which caused him to order Corvus Glaive to send down an air strike from Sanctuary II. Falcon had stayed high in the air and avoid these missiles, while Wong created Tao Mandalas to protect the heroes on the ground. However, when these missiles were diverted into the sky, which made Falcon question what was happening, which was then revealed to be Captain Marvel who then destroyed Sanctuary II.

Falcon showing respect to Iron Man's sacrifice
Falcon continued to fight back against Thanos' forces, until the entire army were suddenly wiped out by Iron Man, who wielded the Infinity Stones to cause a third Snap, which wiped out the opposing army as well as Thanos himself, finally ending the conflict. However, this had come with the cost of Stark's life, and everybody there, including Falcon, gathered around Stark, and showed the respect by kneeling before the hero who had sacrificed himself to save the universe.

Receiving the Shield
Wilson attending the funeral for Tony Stark
After their battle, Wilson attended Tony Stark's funeral, along with all the other heroes, as well as several other people, showing their own respect. Wilson had stood with Bucky Barnes and Wanda Maximoff, as they watched Pepper Potts and Morgan Stark walk down and then place Stark's Arc Reactor into the lake. Seeing how Barnes was saddened by Stark's death, Wilson had placed his comforting hand onto his shoulder.

Wilson offering to travel with Captain America
Following Stark's funeral, the Avengers decided to return the Infinity Stones and Mjølnir to whence they were taken to stop devastating branches in those timelines. Wilson met up with Steve Rogers, since it was Rogers who had volunteered for their mission, meeting him in the forest just outside their destroyed Avengers Facility, where Bruce Banner constructed a new time machine. Wilson had then offered to accompany Rogers on the mission, but Rogers politely declined.

Wilson watches Steve Rogers go through time
Wilson then asked how long this would take, which Banner informed him that it would be however long it would take Rogers to complete this mission, but it would only be around five seconds for the rest of them. Wilson watched as Rogers put on the Advanced Tech Suit, as they awaited for their mission to begin. Banner had then sent Rogers through the Quantum Realm. However, Wilson witnessed Rogers not returning back after the five seconds that Banner had promised.

Wilson realizes what Steve Rogers has done
Wilson then became concerned as he then demanded Banner bring Rogers back, until he was stopped as Barnes had calmly directed his attention to the lake, where an old man was sitting on a bench alone. As he then realized this was Rogers, Wilson walked over and greeted him, seeing that he had aged considerably since they last saw each other. Wilson had asked about the mission, which Rogers just told him that he stayed out in the 1940s to live a peaceful life.

Wilson greeting the older Steve Rogers
With Rogers noting that once he had put the Infinity Stones back, he had decided to live out a life that Stark had always told him about, as he told Wilson that it was a beautiful life. Wilson told him he was truly happy for him, but expressed his sadness in living in a world with no Captain America in it. However, this had then led Rogers to reveal his shield, which he told Wilson to try on, while the surprised Wilson turned to Barnes, who gave him his nod of encouragement.

Wilson was hesitant about taking up the shield, while Barnes nodded to him, supporting him to claim it. He then picked it up, saying it felt like it did not belong to him. Rogers had reassured Wilson's doubts, confirming that it was his now. Wilson thanked Rogers for the honor, promising to do his best. The two then shook hands, causing Wilson to notice the ring on Rogers' finger, so he then asked about his wife, as Rogers politely stated that he would not tell Wilson about her.

New Missions
Rescue of Captain Vassant
Falcon being briefed on their rescue mission
Due to his affiliation with the Avengers and his role in saving the universe from Thanos, Wilson was legally forgiven for his violation of the Sokovia Accords back in 2016. With the Avengers disbanded, Wilson returned to working with the United States Air Force, where he assisted with various missions as an independent contractor. Having been recruited once more, Wilson was informed by Major Hill that Captain Vassant had been kidnapped by a group called LAF, who were attempting to take Vassant into Libya, with Hill telling Wilson that they needed him to ensure that LAF was not successful.

As Wilson prepared to begin the mission, Hill explained that the military could not been seen actin in Tunisian airspace, with Wilson understanding that he would be dropped off, where he would fly low and intercept with Vassant's plane, without the treaties being seen to be violaned. Hill also explained that Joaquín Torres would be aiding on the mission on the ground, as Wilson activated his EXO-7 Falcon, and dropped out of the plane, with Hill reminding him to be subtle.

Falcon catches up with the hijacked plane
While he flew towards the hijacked plane, Falcon was informed by Torres that he would be getting his intel on his Combat Goggles, as Falcon caught up with the plane, questioning if LAF could be seen nearby, which Torres denied. However, as Falcon attached himself to the side of their plane, he looked inside and discovered that the pilot was dead, with Louie having taken over, as Falcon had explained to Torres that LAF had already managed to hijack the plane.

However, Falcon briefly stayed too close to the window and was spotted by Louie, with Falcon flying back to avoid further detection, although Louie's protests about a man on the outside of the plane were not believed by his allies. Using his goggles, Falcon scanned the plane and located Vassant, who was being beaten by LAF agents, resulting in Falcon sending Redwing to cut through the door of the plane with it's lasers, intending to surprise the LAF agents.

Falcon ambushes Georges Batroc's soldiers
Once Redwing had torn off the door, Falcon burst inside and had immediately subdued Georges Batroc with a powerful kick, before proceeding to take down the next three LAF agents as they tried to understand what was happening, with Falcon kicking one agent out of the plane. As another agent began shooting at him, Falcon used his wings to block the bullets, resulting in one killing Louie, causing the plane to fall, while Falcon subdued the last agent with his jetpack.

Falcon fighting back against Georges Batroc
As the plane fell into auto-pilot, Falcon turned to Vassant, and prepared to get him off the plane, only for Batroc to charge at him and assault Falcon with a strong kick to the face. However, Falcon was able to fight back against Batroc, blocking and avoiding his punches and kicks, before kicking him in the chest. As Falcon attempted to charge at Batroc with his jetpack, Batroc was able to grab him in mid-air, and slam him back down to the ground and kick him back.

Falcon blocking Georges Batroc's gunshots
Once Falcon got back to his feet, he witnessed Batroc and the other LAF agents donning their LAF Wingsuits and leaping out of the plane with Vassant, as Batroc had shot at Falcon to keep him at bay, with Falcon blocking the gunshots with his wings. Once the shooting had stopped, Falcon realized they were escaping, and leapt out from the plane to catch up with Batroc and to rescue Vassant, with one agent shooting at Falcon, only for him to pull the agent's parachute.

Falcon chases down Georges Batroc's men
Falcon proceeded to chase Batroc's men into a canyon, where his wings caused him to be at a disadvantage, as he was unable to fly through the smaller gaps in the rocks, briefly scrapping his wings during the chase. Falcon had then discovered that Batroc had called in a squad of helicopters, causing Falcon to deploy Redwing to take down the helicopters. As Redwing shot at the next helicopter, Falcon dragged the gunner out with a cable, while Redwing took out it's propellors.

Falcon takes down more of the LAF soldiers
Seeing Vassant was taken to a third helicopter, Falcon attempted to catch up with him, only for an LAF agents to slam into him in midair. However, Falcon was swiftly able to subdue the agent, and threw him against the rocks, causing him to fall to his death, while Falcon continued chasing Vassant. Falcon managed to board the helicopter, just as Batroc had been bragging that they would escape, as Falcon took down one agent, while the other had then damaged his jetpack.

Falcon avoiding the multiple LAF missiles
During the struggle, Batroc was able to get away with Vassant, as Falcon subdued the other LAF agents, leaping off the helicopter and destroying it with a grenade. While his thrusters were damaged, Falcon was informed by Torres that he was approaching Libyan airspace, where the military could not enter, and would only have ninety seconds to complete the mission. Making matters worse, was another LAF helicopter that began shooting at Falcon, as he struggled to escape.

Falcon takes Vassant from Georges Batroc
During the chaos, Falcon barely avoided the missiles, and almost flew into the helicopter blades, before managing to fly close enough to one helicopter, that the missiles destroyed it. Although Torres attempted to call off the mission, Falcon's thrusters came back alone, allowing him to fly directly through Batroc's helicopter, dragging Vassant to safety, moments before the missiles destroyed the helicopter, which Batroc barely survived, as Falcon flew Vassant to the ground.

Learning of Flag Smashers
Wilson and Joaquín Torres discuss the mission
Following their successful rescue of Vassant, Wilson and Joaquín Torres went to a Tunisian café, where Wilson began to work on Redwing, repairing the damage done during his fight against LAF. Once Torres brought Wilson a cup of tea, he attempted to assist him with Redwing's repairs, which Wilson refused, noting that whenever the Air Force attempted to work on Redwing it caused glitches.

Wilson being thanked for his heroic actions
While Torres noted that the Air Force could not handle anything that involved the Stark Industries technology, they were interrupted by a Tunisian man recognised Wilson as a member of the Avengers, as he noted that Wilson had saved his wife's life, with Wilson greeting him in Arabic. Torres teased Wilson for his knowledge of Arabic, before he noted that LAF and Georges Batroc had been attempting to take advantage of the chaos following the Snap to make money.

Wilson being told about the Flag Smashers
However, Torres then noticed a symbol while scanning the area on his phone, which he showed to Wilson, explaining that it was the symbol of the Flag Smashers, who he claimed were a group that they needed to worry about, with Wilson mocked the poor name choice. Torres explained to Wilson that the Flag Smashers believed that the world was better before the Blip, with Wilson noting that when things got better for one group, it got worse for another.

Wilson leaving to return to Washington, D.C.
Wilson told Torres to keep an eye on the Flag Smashers and update him if it got serious, before Torres questioned Wilson about Steve Rogers, noting that there had been discussion online that Rogers had been hiding out on the Moon, which Wilson scoffed at. Wilson then packed up Redwing, with Torres offering to pay for the tea, as Wilson explained that he was heading to Washington, D.C., but had jokingly claimed that he would be going to deal with Moon business.

Donating the Shield

Upon returning to his apartment in Washington, D.C., Wilson had gotten dressed for his upcoming ceremony, having decided that he would not be the right man to continue the legacy of Captain America, still believing that the shield felt like it would never belong to him. Having ironed his shirt, Wilson finished getting dressed into his suit, before looking down at the shield on his bed, picking it up and studying it closely, before gently putting it inside of his bag and departing for the ceremony.

Wilson paying his tributes to Steve Rogers
Wilson had then gone to the Smithsonian Institution for the ceremony, where he gave a speech to the crowd, paying tribute to Rogers, who he claimed had represented the best in all of them. Wilson described Rogers as being courageous and hopeful, as well as jokingly claiming that he mastered posing stoically, which the crowd laughed at. Wilson had then acknowledged how the world had changed since the Blip, describing how the the world into complete turmoil.

Wilson insisting the world needs new heroes
Wilson had claimed the world needed new heroes, who were suited for the times that they now were living in, which Wilson still did not believe that he was qualified to become. With that, Wilson told the crowd that symbols were nothing without the men and women who gave them the true meaning, before he also claimed that there had never been any greater symbol than Captain America's shield, but had also insisted that the shield was nothing without Rogers.
