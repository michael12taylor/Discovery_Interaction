One picture in particular was a taunt to Jones from Kilgrave which stated "See You Later." As Simpson regained consciousness, Jones had convinced him that he followed Kilgrave's orders of jumping off the building by pretending to fall on a pile of garbage. Simpson expressed confusion as well as horror believing that he had killed Walker despite Jones trying to inform him that he killed no one. Jones had advised Simpson to forget everything that had just happened before leaving him.

Kilgrave's Spy
Jones breaks up with Cage
 The evening after losing Kilgrave, Jessica went to Luke Cage's apartment. Cage immediately noticed the cuts and scrapes on Jones' face and invited her inside. Jones, however, refused and decided to break up with Cage stating that she had too much business to handle to be involved with Cage or anyone. Despite Cage suspecting that Jones' decision has something to do with his deceased wife, he responded by telling Jones to do what she had to do before retreating back to his apartment.

Jones learns that someone is spying on her
After leaving Cage's apartment, Jones notices that one of the photographs that Kilgrave was in possession of showed an image of her on the fire escape the night that she had photographed the affair between Cage and Gina. This led Jones to deduce that all of the photos that Kilgrave had possessed was produced by someone spying for Kilgrave.

A New Client
Jones meets Audrey Eastman
The following day, Jones attempted to find out who the spy could possibly be. Before she could proceed any further with her investigation, she was summoned back to her office by a new client named Audrey Eastman, whose divorce lawyer under Hogarth referred Jones to her. Eastman claimed that she and her husband were in the process of getting a divorce and wanted Jones to take photographs of her husband and his mistress in a promiscuous act as leverage for their divorce proceedings. Due to Eastman's anxious and odd behavior, Jones grew suspicious of her and believed in the possibility that she might be Kilgraved. Nevertheless, she took on Eastman's case.

Jones showing Simpson that Walker is alive
Jones had later received a frantic call from Walker stating that  the same officer who attacked her before was trying to break into her apartment. Jones immediately went to Walker's apartment and saw through Walker's surveillance camera that Simpson is in a state of guilt believing that he murdered Walker. Jones and Walker greeted Simpson at the door, confirming that Walker was alive. Jones revealed to Simpson that she had Walker sedated to make Simpson believe that he killed her. Simpson expressed an intense need to go after Kilgrave, but Jones refused to allow him to become involved in handling Kilgrave. Still worried for her best friend, Jones had arranged for Walker to publicly apologize for her harsh criticisms of Kilgrave to which Walker herself had reluctantly obliged in doing.

Jones watching Eastman
Jones had decided to follow Audrey Eastman in making sure she was not under Kilgrave's control. She even went as far as questioning Hogarth if Eastman is a legitimate client of Tobey. Not knowing for sure of Eastman's motives, if any, Jones had spent much of the day watching Eastman from afar. During this time, she notices a police surveillance camera posted on the sidewalk, and opted to actually ask for Simpson's help in tracking down the spy for Kilgrave to which he agreed.

Jones watching Eastman fire her gun
During the continuation in following Audrey Eastman, Jones tracked her to an abandoned building. To Jones' surprise, Eastman was using the facility as means for target practice with a concealed gun. At this point, Jones concludes if Eastman was under Kilgrave's control, the latter would no longer be under his influence given the amount of time that has expired, therefore, she's planning to use the weapon for another purpose.

More Kilgrave Victims
Jeri Hogarth reminding Jones of a favor
Jones visited Hogarth at her firm where a meeting was about to take place among people who claimed to be under Kilgrave's control. Hogarth, who is in a bitter break-up with her wife Wendy, wanted Jones to dig up some dirt on Wendy as a leg-up for their pending divorce, reminding Jones of her promise of owing a favor to Hogarth.

Jones disgusted by Hogarth's talk of Kilgrave
Jones, along with Hogarth, had heard the statements made by the potential Kilgrave victims. Only a few of the statements stood out to Jones as one female victim described how Kilgrave would not allow her to stop smiling, while a male victim described how Kilgrave had forced him to hand over an expensive jacket. At the end of the meeting with the victims, Hogarth expresses an interest in Kilgrave's abilities stating the usefulness of his gifts, much to Jones' protest, who punches Hogarth's glass door out of anger and frustration.

A "Kilgraved" girl with a message for Jones
Later into the evening, Jones was greeted by Simpson, who provided Jones with the police surveillance footage needed to track Kilgrave's spy. While entering Jones' apartment complex, Simpson notices Malcolm Ducasse loitering and proceeded to aggressively question him. Jones quickly diffused the situation citing Ducasse as an addict, and in turn, Simpson apologized for his paranoid behavior. Jones advised Simpson to join the meeting of Kilgrave victims to help him cope with his recent experiences. Simpson left, not wanting to take Jones' offer for help. The next day, Jones was confronted by an eight-year-old girl named Chanise who was under Kilgrave's control. The girl stated that Kilgrave liked Trish Walker's apology over the radio, thus ensured Walker's safety for the time being. She had also scold Jones for leaving Kilgrave to die the night of the bus crash. Jones, already at her breaking point from constant torment by Kilgrave, tried to interrogate the girl on the latter's whereabouts, only for the girl's mother to intervene and warn Jones to stay away from her daughter.

Attempted Murder
Jones threatened by Audrey Eastman
Jones continued her investigation with the Eastman case, by following Carlo Eastman to an apartment building in order to gather evidence of his infidelity. After Carlo enters the building, Jones flies up to the level where Carlo was to meet his mistress. Jones witnessed Carlo in bed with another woman, and at the same time, received a phone call from Audrey Eastman. Jones immediately noticed that something was not right, as she saw Carlo was still in full clothing and that Audrey questioned Jones about her husband, with Jones finding the phone call and Audrey's timing to be too coincidental. As Jones disconnected the call to Eastman, she could hear the latter's voice coming from the room where Carlo had supposedly been with his mistress. Realizing she has been set up, Jones confronted both Eastmans.

Jones telling the Eastmans to leave New York
Audrey Eastman, armed with her gun, threatened to shoot Jones, as Carlo tries to persuade his wife not cause any harm. Jones issues a threat of her own to Eastman, claiming to be bulletproof. Eastman quickly tested the latter's claim by shooting her on her shoulder, causing a painful yet minor injury. Eastman dismisses the idea of Jones being bulletproof as well as having laser-eyes, thus revealing that Eastman is an acquaintance of  Gregory Spheeris and his wife. Eastman also reveals that she is on a crusade against people with “gifted” abilities due to the death of her mother as a result of “the incident,” comparing Jones to the Avengers whom she blames for her mother's death. Despite Jones telling Eastman that she had nothing to do with the incident or was not even present during the event, Eastman declares that killing Jones is a “preventative measure for next time.”

Jones manages to lift the plastic setting beneath Eastman, forcing her to lose her balance and relinquish her firearm. As Carlo tried to gain control of the weapon, Jones pushed him aside and took the gun before effectively disposing it. In a state of rage, Jones had began tearing the room apart forcing the Eastman's to take refuge in a corner, fearing for their safety. Jones had expressed that Eastman is not the only person who had lost loved ones as Jones' family were killed in a car accident, but does not pursue those who are not responsible, including reckless drivers, and demanded that the Eastman's keep their aggression to themselves. Jones then deceived the Eastmans into believing that she has 99 friends who are also gifted and that they, as well as the police, will know what the Eastmans had tried to do unless they leave New York for good. Jones leaves the terrified Eastman's with Carlo wanting an official divorce from his wife.

After closing out the Eastman case, Jones had recovered from her bullet wound and prepared to join a new meeting of "Kilgraved" victims which took place in a small dining restaurant. As she made her way to the entrance, she received a call from Hogarth, who notified Jones that she had sent more surviving victims to attend the meeting. Hogarth also berated Jones for damaging her property via her glass door, after their last meeting, but Jones quickly dismissed Hogarth's complaints before settling in to attend the meeting of the new victims.

During the Kilgrave victim's group therapy, a man had revealed that he became Kilgrave's chauffeur after he was forced to abandon his son on a sidewalk, and for an entire week, drove Kilgrave where he needed to go regularly. Jones had quickly questioned the man, asking if he witnessed anyone deliver photographs to Kilgrave recently, in which the man confirms that Kilgrave would meet the same person at the same location everyday at 10 a.m. to deliver pictures to Kilgrave. After learning the description of the mysterious person of interest, Jones returned to her office and pulled up the NYPD surveillance. After hours of research, Jones notice that she was being followed by a man based on the description that was given to her earlier. To her shock, Jones discovered that the person who fits the description looks a great deal like her next door neighbor, Malcolm Ducasse.
