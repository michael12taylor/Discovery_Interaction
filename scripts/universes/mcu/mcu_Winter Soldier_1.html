Sergeant James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes is a World War II veteran, a former officer of the 107th Infantry Regiment and best friend of Steve Rogers since childhood. Barnes enlisted in the army and assigned to the 107th in 1943. His regiment was captured by HYDRA, where Barnes was given a variant of the Super Soldier Serum by Arnim Zola. Barnes, along with whoever still remained from his regiment, was later rescued by Rogers, who had become Captain America during Barnes' absence. Upon joining forces with the continuing war, Barnes and Rogers formed their Howling Commandos, to battle Red Skull's forces. However, during their attempt to finally capture Zola, in the Austrian Alps, Barnes was caught in their ambush and plummeted hundreds of feet from a train. As no body was ever recovered, Barnes had then been presumed deceased.

Unbeknownst to his team, Barnes' enhanced abilities allowed him to survive the fall, albeit with the loss of his left arm. Once he was found by the Soviet Union and HYDRA, Barnes was subsequently brainwashed and armed with a new cybernetic limb in order to become their operative, known as the Winter Soldier. Over the next fifty years, he would eliminate anyone who posed any threat to HYDRA, including Howard Stark and his wife, Maria. Between all these assassination missions, the Winter Soldier would be put into a cryogenic stasis to ensure his longevity. In 2014, the Winter Soldier had been ordered by Alexander Pierce to assassinate Nick Fury, in order to ensure that all Pierce's schemes with Project Insight could go ahead. However, the Winter Soldier was challenged by Steve Rogers, which triggered him to begin remembering his prior life. 

In the wake of their Battle at the Triskelion, Barnes, free from his brainwashing, deserted HYDRA in order to remember his past and end his long, violent history. Two years later, Barnes was then framed for the Bombing of the Vienna International Centre, which claimed the life of T'Chaka, among many other innocent lives. While Black Panther sought his revenge for his father's death, Barnes had been repeatedly saved by Captain America, which sparked the Avengers Civil War as a team of Avengers led by Iron Man was sent to capture him. However, they eventually learned that Helmut Zemo framed Barnes and reactivated his brainwashing, so that Zemo could reveal that Barnes had murdered Stark's parents years ago. Having just survived Stark's revenge attempt, Barnes was given amnesty in Wakanda by T'Challa and was placed in cryostasis, until all HYDRA's control triggers could be removed from his mind.

Barnes was eventually cured of his brainwashing by the efforts of Shuri. However, as Thanos had attempted to kill Vision for the Mind Stone, Barnes returned to combat to stop the Mad Titan's plans, receiving his new vibranium arm. Barnes joined T'Challa and the Avengers to help fight off the threat, only for Thanos to defeat them and assemble all of the Infinity Stones. Barnes was subsequently disintegrated as Thanos eliminated half of all life in the universe. In 2023, Barnes was resurrected by Hulk, as he had then participated in the final battle against Thanos' forces. In the aftermath of the battle, he attended the funeral of Stark with all the other heroes. Later on Barnes bid Rogers farewell, knowing of his true intention to travel back to the 1940s in order to live with Peggy Carter. Barnes was then present to witness Rogers, as a much older man, return home in order to then choose Sam Wilson to pass the shield onto.

With his name pardoned, Barnes sought atonement for all his actions as the Winter Soldier. His attempts were interrupted when John Walker was made the next Captain America, and the Flag Smashers emerged to act against the GRC's efforts to handle the aftermath of the Blip. He and Sam Wilson would then go on a mission to stop the Flag Smashers, temporarily working alongside Helmut Zemo and Sharon Carter. However, the mission was complicated by Walker's attacks, until Walker murdered a Flag Smasher over Battlestar's death. Barnes and Wilson were forced to defeat Walker to stop him from continuing to be Captain America. Barnes would then join Wilson and Walker in the final battle with the Flag Smashers, helping in their defeat and finally making amends with his past.

Biography
Early Life
Meeting Steve Rogers
James Barnes was born on March 10, 1917 and was the eldest child of four. Barnes grew up to be an overachiever, having been an excellent athlete who also excelled inside the classroom. Sometime during his childhood, he met Steve Rogers when bullies were trying to steal his money. The two became best friends and stuck together for many years, with Barnes often defending Rogers from bullies who would have attempted to take advantage of Rogers' short height and small build.

After one of their trips together to Rockaway Beach, Barnes and Rogers had ended up being forced to get a ride back towards Brooklyn on the back of a freezer truck as they had used all their remaining train money to buy hot dogs, while Barnes had also inadvertently managed to spend three dollars as he attempted to win a stuffed bear for Dolores. Another time when they went to Coney Island together, Barnes convinced Rogers to ride the Cyclone, which resulted in Rogers throwing up due to the ride, much to Barnes' great amusement.

World War II
Training for War
Barnes takes Rogers to Sarah Rogers' funeral
In 1936, Steve Rogers' mother died of tuberculosis and they buried her beside her husband. After her funeral, Barnes walked Rogers home and offered him his place to stay, but Rogers refused, saying he could get by on his own. Seeing Rogers struggling to find his house keys, Barnes revealed his secret key and told him that he did not have to because he was with him "to the end of the line," something Rogers would always keep to heart.

Barnes attempts to comfort Steve Rogers
In 1941, during their art class, Barnes and Rogers found out that the United States of America had joined the World War II. They visited the US Recruiting and Induction Center within New York City where Rogers was classified as 4F and rejected from service, while Barnes enlistment was accepted into the United States Army where he earned the rank of Sergeant and underwent sniper training. Barnes, along with the rest of the 107th Infantry Regiment, had been trained during the winter at Camp McCoy, Wisconsin.

1943 Stark Expo
Barnes telling Rogers he has joined the army
The day before his shipment out into England, Barnes found Steve Rogers getting beaten up by his bully. He came to the defense of his friend and quickly sent the bully running away with a punch to the jaw and a kick to the behind.

Barnes promises to cheer up Steve Rogers
Barnes learned that Rogers had been attempting to enlist in the army again so he could fight in World War II, using false documents to try and get deployed. Barnes informed Rogers that he had received his orders and would be going into war the next morning. At first, Rogers seemed upset, as he was not shipping out to war with them. Barnes remained determined to cheer his friend up and reminded him that he would last be the last eligible bachelor left within New York City.

Barnes and Rogers arriving at the Stark Expo
Barnes and Rogers went to the Stark Expo together, as Barnes was determined to enjoy his last day in the city before shipping out. What Barnes did not tell Rogers, however, was that it was, in fact, a double date with Connie and Bonnie, who were both highly excited to spend the evening with a handsome soldier like Sgt Barnes. When Rogers asked what Barnes had told his own date about him, Barnes simply replied, "only the good stuff" while greeting both of these girls.

Barnes watches Howard Stark's presentations
While happily exploring the Expo together, the group of four saw the latest inventions, which Stark Industries was showing off. They later watched as Howard Stark himself demonstrated Hovercar, which had greatly impressed Barnes until it malfunctioned and fell to the ground hard, although Stark was able to joke that the car was his prototype. When Barnes turned around to suggest their group go out dancing, he saw that Rogers had walked away from the group to try and enlist in the army yet again, despite Barnes' many previous objections.

Barnes tries to convince Rogers not to enlist
Barnes soon found Rogers trying to enlist, and first tried to persuade him to rejoin him on the double date. When that did not work, he had reminded him that he wasn't going to be fighting in a back alley, but in a war. Despite Barnes' protests, Rogers went through with this but said a heartfelt goodbye to Barnes before doing so. Rogers told him not to win the war until he got there, and Barnes left with both of the girls. Barnes and his unit shipped out into England the next day.

Prisoner of War
Barnes fights the Nazis during WWII
While serving on the front lines of World War II, Barnes and his unit, which included Dum Dum Dugan and Gabe Jones, were ambushed by the Wehrmacht troops at Azzano on the Italian Front. Although the battle seemed hopeless as they were strongly outgunned and without any reinforcements, the battle turned when another German unit then appeared and used an extremely powerful tank which proceeded to easily kill the remaining Nazis who fled.

Barnes and his unit are captured by HYDRA
As Barnes, Dugan, and Jones got out of their hiding place and looked over the remains of the battlefield, the tank then turned its weaponry towards the Americans and they were soon captured by HYDRA. Once they were HYDRA's prisoners, Barnes and the others were sent to work at the weapon facility in Austria where they were forced to help make the new weaponry for HYDRA's forces.

Barnes is experimented on by HYDRA
In October 1943, Barnes met other Allied POWs, including Jacques Dernier and James Montgomery Falsworth. During his imprisonment in the facility, he was viciously beaten by Lohmer, however, other prisoners organized an "accident" which resulted in Lohmer's death. Barnes and his friends worked on parts of the Valkyrie. When Barnes became too weak to continue, he was taken to serve as a test subject for Arnim Zola's super soldier experiments and received Zola's recreated version of the Super Soldier Serum.

Saved by Captain America
Barnes is finally rescued by Steve Rogers
In November 1943, the facility was infiltrated by Steve Rogers, who had undergone an experiment giving him enhanced strength. Rogers made his way through the base and freed the prisoners, including Barnes, having discovered him while chasing down Arnim Zola. Seeing his friend and his newly transformed body, Barnes was surprised and confused, noting that he remembered Rogers being considerably shorter than he was now while Rogers dragged him out.

Barnes and Rogers face down Red Skull
As the freed POWs battled against the HYDRA forces, being led by Dum Dum Dugan, Rogers and Barnes became trapped inside the base as it began to self destruct. During the escape, Barnes and Rogers encountered Johann Schmidt who mocked Rogers' transformation at the hands of Abraham Erskine. After a brief fight, Schmidt and Rogers soon became separated before Schmidt revealed to them his true demonic face, caused by taking an early version of the Super Soldier Serum. Schmidt mocked Rogers' belief that he was still just a simple soldier despite being a higher class of humanity before then escaping from the exploding base.

Barnes very carefully makes his own escape
With Schmidt gone, Rogers and Barnes refocused their efforts and began working out an escape route. Rogers suggested that they move up and they decided to use a support beam to move to a safe section of the facility. Due to his poor health, Rogers insisted that Barnes get himself to safety first; however, just as he reached the other side, the beam fell apart from under Barnes' feet, trapping Rogers on the other side of the exploding facility.

Barnes refuses to leave without Steve Rogers
Although Rogers ordered that Barnes escape now before the base exploded and killed them both, Barnes refused, insisting that he would not leave him behind; he claimed that they would be able to find another way across. Barnes watched in amazement as Rogers used his strength to bend a steel bar out of his way before launching himself across the gap and rejoining Barnes. They were then able to escape moments before the entire facility was destroyed.

Return to Camp
Barnes returns with the other rescued POW's
Barnes and Steve Rogers eventually regrouped with all the rest of the escaped Prisoners of War and together they then walked all the way back to Chester Phillips' base in Italy, 30 miles away. Once they had all arrived along with the weapons and vehicles they had stolen from HYDRA, they were then greeted warmly by the other soldiers, who were amazed that Rogers' mission to save the missing men had somehow been successful.

Barnes leads the cheers for Captain America
While Barnes and Dum Dum Dugan were reuniting with their fellow soldiers, Rogers then offered to surrender himself for court-martial; however, Phillips chose not to punish Rogers for undertaking the rescue mission against all of Phillips' strict orders against that plan. As the entire unit gathered together and Rogers was reunited by Peggy Carter, who teased him for being late as Rogers had been unable to contact her to inform her of the success, Barnes then called for the soldiers to cheer for Rogers as their savior. The Prisoners of War were then given some medical attention before all being given some time away from the battlefield to recover.

Howling Commandos
Barnes joins the Howling Commandos
After their escape from the HYDRA prison, Barnes and all the other former Prisoners of War, including Dum Dum Dugan, were given a break from duty in London. Steve Rogers later joined them inside of the Whip & Fiddle pub and convinced them to join his crusade against the Nazis and HYDRA, forming a group of fighters known as the Howling Commandos.

Barnes attempts to flirt with Peggy Carter
Barnes told Rogers that he would not follow Captain America, but he would follow his friend. When Peggy Carter also arrived at the pub to inform Rogers of an upcoming meeting with Chester Phillips and Howard Stark, Barnes had to deal with the realization that Rogers was now the one who gets flirted with, not him. Rogers teased Barnes by suggested that Carter might have a friend before discussing if he would be keeping the uniform of Captain America.

Barnes works as a sniper in World War II
Having agreed to return to the battlefield, Barnes alongside the newly formed Howling Commandos joined Rogers back into the front lines of World War II. Over the following year of the war, Barnes and the rest of the Commandos progressively destroyed most major HYDRA operations and key science facilities, preventing Johann Schmidt and Arnim Zola from completing more projects designed to progress their world-dominating plans.

Barnes is filmed standing by Captain America
Barnes followed the team while they focused on destroying HYDRA's army units, tanks and other facilities, ensuring that HYDRA's strength was greatly reduced while the United States Army, as well as the Strategic Scientific Reserve, continued moving forward against them. Barnes would often work like the sniper of the group, protecting his team of Commandos, standing by while Jacques Dernier planted bombs on the HYDRA tanks to successfully destroy them.

Final Mission
Barnes and Rogers prepare for a mission
At the beginning of 1945, Barnes, Captain America and the rest of the Howling Commandos prepared for a mission to board the Schnellzug EB912 train carrying Arnim Zola, with the aim of capturing him to learn about the Red Skull's plans. While they looked over the side of the snowy mountain they would have to navigate, Barnes joked that this mission was Rogers' way of getting payback for the time Barnes made Rogers ride a roller coaster that made him throw up, which Rogers neither confirmed nor denied.

Barnes and Rogers hunt down Arnim Zola
When Jim Morita intercepted a radio signal from HYDRA confirming that Zola was on the train, Barnes, Rogers and Gabe Jones used a zip wire to board the train as it traveled through the mountains. While Jones stayed on top of the roof of the train, Barnes and Rogers entered and began exploring the various carriages. Moments after their arrival, however, they were suddenly split up and ambushed by a team of armored HYDRA soldiers sent to kill them by Zola.

Barnes fighting onboard the HYDRA train
While Rogers was forced to fight the heavily armed HYDRA guard, Barnes became pinned down by three soldiers. Although he was able to kill two, Barnes soon ran out of ammunition and feared he would soon be killed. Rogers, however, was able to open up the door and throw him a new gun which he used to kill the last remaining soldier when Rogers distracted him. Barnes claimed that he had him on the ropes and Rogers assured him that he still believed him.

Barnes picks up Captain America's shield
However, just as the pair began to relax, another HYDRA soldier then appeared behind them and fired at them with a Arnimhilation 99L Assault Weapon, blowing a hole through the side of the train and knocking Rogers off his feet. Barnes picked up Captain America's Shield and fired at the soldier, but he was shot again, the power of the blast throwing him off the train and leaving him hanging on to a damaged rail for dear life as the train continued to speed through the mountains.

Barnes seemingly falls towards his death
Rogers had dispatched the soldier by launching his shield at him and turned his attention to desperately trying to rescue Barnes as he hung off a rail on the side of the train. Rogers begged Barnes to hold on as he inched closer to him and tried to grab his hand, but before they could reach each other, the rail snapped, which then resulted in Barnes falling down to the icy Danube River below as Rogers could only look in horror as Barnes seemingly disappeared forever.

HYDRA's Operative
Captured by HYDRA
Barnes loses his left arm following his fall
Due to his enhanced physiology granted to him by the Super Soldier Serum, Barnes was just able to survive the fall from the train, though his left arm was ripped from his body upon impact. His nearly lifeless body was discovered by a Soviet soldier, who dragged him back to a Soviet POW camp, where he remained until Arnim Zola was released from the SSR's custody.

Barnes wakes up to find his new robotic hand
In the care of the new HYDRA, working within S.H.I.E.L.D., Barnes became the first subject of the Winter Soldier Program. Removing the remnants of his severed arm, the doctors replaced the missing limb with a prosthetic one. In order to erase his memories as Barnes and remold him to their liking, HYDRA frequently used a Memory Suppressing Machine to perform electroconvulsive therapy, which inflicted serious brain damage on Barnes. With his limbic system being severely compromised, Barnes lost access to his memories prior to the experiments while becoming hyperaware of his environment and highly susceptible to commands.

Barnes being frozen to remain preserved
With his body at beyond the peak of physical perfection and his arm at the highest level of weaponized technology, Barnes was put to use as HYDRA's personal weapon for many years. They kept him frozen in suspended animation after every mission to prevent him from aging. Whenever Barnes completed a mission, HYDRA would have his mind painfully wiped to ensure he remained memory-free and emotionless towards those he killed.

Taking Out HYDRA's Threats
Winter Soldier beginning working for HYDRA
Receiving vast training from both HYDRA and the Soviet Union in conjunction with being a super soldier, Barnes became a formidable fighter and an even more ruthless killer. His experiences as a Soviet super soldier would eventually earn him the moniker of "Winter Soldier." Winter Soldier would remain frozen for long periods of time until HYDRA saw fit to unfreeze him for missions.

In 1951, Winter Soldier was unfrozen and deployed to aid the Soviet forces during the Korean War, where he encountered an American super soldier named Isaiah Bradley. Despite his best efforts, Winter Soldier was unable to kill Bradley, with Bradley being able to nearly destroy his metal arm, although they both survived the encounter.

Over the next fifty years, Winter Soldier was responsible for numerous assassinations, killing various sorts of targets from scientific minds to political figures, including John F. Kennedy in 1963. Due to his expertise in the field and shadowy nature, the Winter Soldier became something of a ghost story, with intelligence agencies doubting he even existed.

Assassination of the Starks
Winter Soldier getting defrosted by HYDRA
While in the Cryostasis Chamber, Winter Soldier was held in the HYDRA Siberian Facility. On December 16, 1991, he was defrosted by Vasily Karpov who, once his memories had been wiped yet again by the Memory Suppressing Machine, ensured Barnes was loyal to HYDRA by using key words to reinforce his conditioning.

Winter Soldier has his memories wiped again
With his mind programmed, Karpov informed Barnes that they needed him to steal a supply of the Super Soldier Serum from the car of Howard Stark, and assassinate Stark and his wife Stark in the process. Winter Soldier traveled to Long Island in New York and waited for Stark to leave his home and travel down the road; at which point he gave chase on his motorbike and struck off one of the tires with his metal arm, causing it to veer off the road and crash into a nearby tree. Momentarily ignoring all the injured victims, Winter Soldier first ensured that he retrieved the Super Soldier Serum before turning his attention onto Stark, who had survived and slowly crawled away from the car wreck in an attempt to escape.

Winter Soldier prepares to kill Howard Stark
As the badly wounded Stark crawled away from the car wreck and pleaded to save his wife's life, Winter Soldier ignored his pleas and grabbed a hold of Stark with his metal arm. As Stark looked up at his assassin, he recognized him from their time together during World War II, and addressed him as Sergeant Barnes. However, Winter Soldier ignored the comments and proceeded to bash Stark's face with his metal arm, cracking Stark's skull and killing him. With his first target now dead, the Winter Soldier then carried Stark's corpse and placed him back inside the car before proceeding to strangle Stark's wife to death.

Winter Soldier reporting back to Vasily Karpov
With both his targets now dead, Barnes destroyed the CCTV camera, thereby making it seem like the Starks had died in a car accident. Returning to the HYDRA Siberian Facility, he delivered the serum to Karpov, who complimented him on his success. The serum was then used to create multiple Winter Soldiers, who were prepared for missions.

Training Winter Soldiers
Winter Soldier being overpowered by Josef
As HYDRA decided that more enhanced assassins were needed, members of a HYDRA death squad were injected with the Super Soldier Serum that Winter Soldier had stolen from Howard Stark and used in the Winter Soldier Program. To ensure the other Winter Soldiers were battle-ready, Winter Soldier was tasked with training them; if they were able to overpower and subdue him, then they would be accepted into the program.

Winter Soldier witnesses the riot breaking out
During one of these training sessions at the HYDRA Siberian Facility, Winter Soldier was defeated. Vasily Karpov congratulated Josef, while a doctor went to check on his vitals. However, Josef was fueled by the adrenaline and attacked the doctor, slamming his face hard into the ground and killing him. As a result, a riot began with the other Winter Soldiers rising up against their masters and attacking Karpov and the other guards.

Winter Soldier locking up the Winter Soldiers
As a fight broke out, Winter Soldier was ordered by the terrified Karpov to protect him. He took him away from the danger, locking the Soldiers in the cage. While the HYDRA guards eventually subdued the other soldiers and put them back into Cryostasis Chambers. It was then decided by Karpov that they should all be kept on ice until they could be controlled. As Karpov fled to the United States of America, the facility was abandoned after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Massacre at the Hotel Inessa
Winter Soldier ambushing his next target
Still under the control of HYDRA, Winter Soldier traveled to eliminate another target at the Hotel Inessa, who was guarded by a personal selection of his bodyguards. Winter Soldier began his attack on the guards by punching his metal arm through a wall, grabbing a guard and quickly disabling him, before throwing a blade at the next guard, and shooting the next two before they could realize what was happening. With his target fleeing, Winter Soldier leapt off the balcony to get ahead of him.

The fight was a quick one as the target attempted to run, although his personal protection unit was quickly killed by Winter Soldier, with his target's two closest guards being shot and impaled with Winter Soldier's knives within a matter of seconds. With his target defenseless, Winter Soldier grabbed his neck, and uttered "Hail HYDRA" as he used his Prosthetic Arm to crush his throat, before dropping his corpse to the floor.

Winter Soldier shoots and kills RJ Nakajima
However, once his target had been executed, Winter Soldier then noticed a man named RJ Nakajima, who had been attempting to enter his hotel room and inadvertently witnessed the massacre, and was too afraid to be able to get his door unlocked and escape. As Winter Soldier approached Nakajima, he was told that Nakajima had seen nothing, although the ruthless super soldier shot Nakajima in the head before escaping.

Encounter with Black Widow
In 2009, Winter Soldier was sent to kill a nuclear scientist who was being escorted by Black Widow. Without hesitation, he attacked his target, sending the car containing the scientist and Black Widow over a cliff. Finding that Black Widow had saved the target from falling to his death, Winter Soldier fired a single round through her stomach and the bullet struck the scientist, effectively killing him. As his mission was accomplished, Winter Soldier made his getaway without pursuit.

HYDRA Uprising
Attack on Nick Fury
Winter Soldier attempts to murder Nick Fury
In 2014, the Winter Soldier was activated by Alexander Pierce once more to go assassinate Director Nick Fury after he had just begun to unravel HYDRA's secret existence due to questioning Project Insight. When Fury managed to escape death at the hands of over a dozen HYDRA agents in Washington, D.C., Winter Soldier managed to get ahead of Fury's SUV and disable it using a Disc Grenade, which caused the car to flip over as the Winter Soldier then easily stepped aside from the flaming wreckage.

The Winter Soldier tracking down Nick Fury
However, as Winter Soldier had made his way to the vehicle to finish Fury off, he found his target had used a Mouse Hole to escape from the wreckage and into the sewers to flee from his would-be assassins. Unwilling to allow his target to get away alive, the Winter Soldier later located Fury at Steve Rogers' apartment, where he was attempting to give Rogers some more vital information about his attack and the possible infiltration in S.H.I.E.L.D.. However, before Fury could reveal anything else, the Winter Soldier shot him through the back multiple times, which punctured straight through his Bulletproof Vest, through the apartment wall from another building way across that street.

Winter Soldier encountering Captain America
With Fury seemingly dead, the Winter Soldier made his escape, but Rogers gave chase and attempted to subdue the Winter Soldier by throwing his shield at him. However, Winter Soldier stopped running as he simply caught the shield with his bionic arm, throwing it back with incredible force after looking at Rogers for a moment. As Rogers stood frozen in shock at the assassin's strength and reflexes, Winter Soldier then escaped before Rogers could see where he went.

Alexander Pierce's Orders
Winter Soldier meeting with Alexander Pierce
Instead of being returned to his Cryostasis Chamber, Winter Soldier was sent to Alexander Pierce's house for his next orders in the wake of Nick Fury's apparent demise, with Winter Soldier sitting in the darkness until Pierce returned. Upon seeing him, Pierce jokingly offered Winter Soldier some milk, although Winter Soldier remained silent as Pierce explained that their timeline had been shifted.

Winter Soldier watches Alexander Pierce kill
He was then informed that his next targets were Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff, who had uncovered and caused the destruction of Arnim Zola, and were now attempting to reveal HYDRA's Project Insight scheme which involved killing their twenty million targets across United States using the Helicarriers. As they were then discovered by Renata, Winter Soldier watched as Pierce shot and kill her to maintain their secrets.

Battle of Washington, D.C.
Winter Soldier after killing Jasper Sitwell
The next day, the Winter Soldier had managed to track down all of his targets and attacked on the freeway while they were kidnapping Jasper Sitwell. Managing to land on the roof of the car, Barnes threw Sitwell from the car into the path of an oncoming truck and fired inside the car to try and assassinate his targets. Before he could get a confirmed kill, however, the Winter Soldier was then thrown off the car's roof as Sam Wilson slammed on the brakes.

Winter Soldier shooting at Captain America
Having stopped himself using his prosthetic arm, the Winter Soldier managed to get out of the way as the car charged towards him and proceeded to rip out the steering wheel, which caused the car to lose control and crash, with Steve Rogers just able to get all his allies to safety. Seeing they had survived, Barnes proceeded to fire a grenade at his targets. Rogers took the blow on his shield and went flying off the bridge, crashing into a bus down below.

Winter Soldier then turned his attention to Natasha Romanoff, as he and his HYDRA team fired upon her until an explosion caused by Barnes' grenade launched caused her to fall from the bridge as well, barely saving herself with a Grappling Hook Gun. With his targets off the bridge and at a disadvantage, the Soldier took his machine gun and aimed off the bridge to finish them off. However, he was shot in the eye by Black Widow, only surviving due to his protective mask.

Winter Soldier attempts to kill Black Widow
Enraged at being shot at, Winter Soldier fired down at Romanoff, barely missing all his shots as she ran for her life down the street. Instead of sharpshooting Romanoff, Winter Soldier ordered his men to deal with Rogers while he personally targeted her. Leaping from the bridge, Winter Soldier landed on a car and pursued the S.H.I.E.L.D. spy through the streets of Washington, D.C. while the civilians ran for cover and Winter Soldier‘s agents fired upon both Rogers and Wilson.

Winter Soldier is outwitted by Black Widow
As he reloaded his grenade launcher, Winter Soldier eventually believed that he had Romanoff cornered when he heard her voice from behind a parked car. In an attempt to kill his target, he silently dropped a Ball Grenade and let it quietly roll towards the source of the sound. However, Winter Soldier soon discovered it was a trick as Romanoff had left her phone playing her voice to distract him so she could sneak up behind him for a sudden ambush.

Winter Soldier is strangled by Black Widow
Once Winter Soldier was distracted, Romanoff jumped onto his shoulder and then attempted to strangle him by using her garrote.

Winter Soldier takes aim at Black Widow
With his arm working once more, the Winter Soldier went in pursuit of Romanoff, who was desperately attempting to get the innocent people out of harm's way while running for her own life. Catching sight of his target, Barnes took aim and fired a single shot while hit Romanoff directly in the shoulder, causing her to fall down. Once he had Romanoff cornered on the street, the Winter Soldier charged forward, leaping onto a car as he prepared to finish her off.

Winter Soldier is confronted by Steve Rogers
Just before the Winter Soldier could kill Black Widow, he was then confronted by Captain America, who ran to his allies’ aid. Seeing the Captain coming, the Winter Soldier spun around and attempted to hit him with his prosthetic arm, only for Captain America to block the blow with his shield. As Winter Soldier kicked him down to the ground, the two engaged in a brutal one-on-one fight, both rivaling each other with every move.

Winter Soldier fighting against Steve Rogers
Determined to kill his target, the Winter Soldier fired every round in his machine gun at Rogers, only for them to be blocked by the shield, spurring the Winter Soldier to use his other weapons, all of which were low on ammunition, which he was eventually force to toss aside and continue with their fight. Having lost all of his guns during their clash, the Winter Soldier managed to briefly get a hold of Captain America's shield before knocking him back with a hard punch to the chest. As Rogers charged towards him, the Winter Soldier launched the shield at Rogers with considerable force, but it missed him and it embedded itself in a nearby van.

Winter Soldier using his knife against Rogers
As the Winter Soldier and Rogers' furious battle continued throughout the streets of Washington, D.C., the Winter Soldier then resorted to using his knife, attempting to plunge it into Rogers' throat as he wildly slashed at his foe. However, as both proved themselves to be equally skilled in combat, since the Winter Soldier was still unable to land the deadly blow and had soon been disarmed. Rogers managed to launch Winter Soldier across the street and into a nearby car before landing another hard strike against him.

Winter Soldier attempting to strangle Rogers
The pair were forced to resort to hand-to-hand combat again as the Winter Soldier had struck back against Rogers, managing to avoid being slammed to the ground. He used his bionic arm to begin strangling Rogers before then launching him across a car. Once Rogers was briefly defenseless on the floor, Winter Soldier attempted to finish the job by striking a hard punch with his metal arm, but he missed and instead smashed the concrete as Rogers moved out of the way.

Winter Soldier trying to stab Captain America
Enraged he still had not killed his target as he had been instructed to do by Alexander Pierce, the Winter Soldier began attacking Captain America with his prosthetic arm, knocking him back into a nearby van before pulling out his second knife. Using his bionic arm to give him even more strength, the Winter Soldier plunged the knife into the van and tore through the metal, while Captain America still avoided the blade and then threw the Winter Soldier off him.

Winter Soldier's arm is damaged by Rogers
Rogers was able to reclaim his shield as he blocked all of the Winter Soldier's continued strikes with his knife before he was able to dodge one blow and embedded his shield in the Winter Soldier's arm, causing serious damage. In the midst of the fight, Rogers ripped the Winter Soldier's mask off his face and stared in disbelief as Barnes turned and revealed his true face. Having recognized him as James "Bucky" Barnes, Rogers brought the Winter Soldier to a standstill.

Winter Soldier's identity is revealed by Rogers
While the Winter Soldier briefly questioned who Barnes was, he soon remembered his mission and swiftly raised his gun to take a shot and kill Rogers in order to complete his mission for HYDRA. However, just before he could fire the shot at Captain America, the Winter Soldier was then suddenly knocked down onto the ground by Falcon, who swooped past in his EXO-7 Falcon before then being shot at by Natasha Romanoff with the grenade launcher he had dropped while fighting Rogers. While the Winter Soldier dodged the fireball, he was still forced to escape from the streets while Brock Rumlow and the team of STRIKE agents charged in and captured the fugitives.

Forgotten Memories
Winter Soldier questioning his entire reality
Regrouping with HYDRA, the Winter Soldier was then taken straight back to the Ideal Federal Savings Bank, where he became erratic and violent towards the doctors. As they were repairing his robotic arm, Barnes started to remember fragments from his past. These memories included his fall from the train back during World War II, as well as all the operations performed on him by Arnim Zola which threw him into a rage as he attacked one of his doctors.

Winter Soldier begins to remember his past
While the Winter Soldier had continued to struggle to control his ever-growing rage, Alexander Pierce arrived at the base to obtain Barnes' mission report. Despite Jack Rollins warning that the Winter Soldier was unpredictable, Pierce spoke to him, only to find the Soldier was unresponsive and refusing to respond until Pierce struck him across the face. Barnes claimed that he knew Captain America somehow, which unnerved Pierce who secretly knew the truth about them.

Winter Soldier going through mind treatment
Pierce claimed that the Winter Soldier only remembered Rogers because he had met him a few days ago on the assignment to kill Nick Fury, but Barnes continued insisting that he knew him. As Brock Rumlow watched closely, Pierce noted how Barnes' work with HYDRA had been a gift to mankind and he needed to do it one more time during Project Insight. Seeing he was still struggling, Pierce then ordered Barnes to undergo some further mind alterations to force Barnes' cooperation.

Battle at the Triskelion
Winter Soldier attacks the S.H.I.E.L.D. Base
Just before HYDRA could complete their goal to rid the world of all potential threats to their reign with Project Insight, as they prepared to activated all of the Helicarriers, their plans were then suddenly intercepted when Captain America and his allies had infiltrated the Triskelion and revealed HYDRA's presence to his fellow agents who had actively engaged in battle with all of HYDRA's undercover agents. In order to stop this from continuing, Alexander Pierce activated the Winter Soldier who arrived and attacked the agents.

Winter Soldier takes control of the Quinjet
In the ensuing chaos, the Winter Soldier charged into the battle firing grenades at the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in order to keep them from aiding Captain America. Using his superior strength and skills, the Winter Soldier easily overpowered the agents, kicking one agent inside the engine of one of the Quinjets while destroying others with grenades. Once the Winter Soldier had cleared through the main teams of the agents, he flew a Quinjet towards one of the Helicarriers.

Winter Soldier rips the Falcon out from the air
Having now made it onboard the Helicarrier, the Winter Soldier then ambushed Captain America and Falcon, as he shoved the Captain off the Helicarrier in an attempt to make him fall all the way to his death upon landing on Washington, D.C. below. The Winter Soldier then proceeded to rip the Falcon out of the air before he destroyed the EXO-7 Falcon by ripping off one of the wings and kicked him off the Helicarrier to hopefully fall all the way to his death as well.

Winter Soldier and Captain America stand off
Seeing that Captain America did not die from the sudden fall and had managed to stay on board of the Helicarrier, the Winter Soldier ran ahead to meet him at the Target System for a final showdown. While the battle continued in the Triskelion, with Pierce currently being held hostage by Nick Fury and Black Widow, while the Falcon was forced to battle against Brock Rumlow, Winter Soldier had gone to confront Captain America.
