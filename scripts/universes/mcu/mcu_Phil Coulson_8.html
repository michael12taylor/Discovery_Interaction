<html><p>Enhanced Strength: Coulson's cybernetic hands gave him some degree of enhanced strength. He was able to keep Lash, an Inhuman with great physical strength, from killing Alphonso Mackenzie by gripping his arm. He was also able to kill Grant Ward by crushing his chest. One version of the hand made him strong enough to crush a metal pipe, rip the barrel off of an assault rifle, and to momentarily stun the android Aida with a single hit. Coulson’s “civvy hand” was strong enough to overpower a Kree soldier’s enhanced strength.
Scanning: By making direct contact with another person's hand, Coulson could scan their handprint, as he did at the Symposium on Alien Contagion.
Electronic Disruption: Coulson was able to disrupt electronic signals, such as the audio signal of the security cameras used in the room where Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter had been interrogated.
Electromagnetic Pulse Emission: Coulson claimed that Leo Fitz could remotely trigger an EMP using the hand.
Coulson and May behind the Energy Shield
Energy Shield: The hand could generate an energy shield that was capable of withstanding explosions and gunfire. When Coulson was fighting against the Superior's LMD, he activated his shield and sliced of the face of the LMD.
Vehicle Manipulation: Coulson remotely controlled a Quinjet using his hand when there was no other way out of the Playground.
X-Ray Vision: The hand was capable of projecting x-rays in order to see inside of objects, such as a truck.
Electronic Communication: When their Quinjet crashed after fleeing from the Attack on Jeffrey Mace, Coulson attempted to call the base with his hand.

Abilities
Expert Martial Artist: Coulson was skilled in multiple martial arts and hand-to-hand combat styles. He fought Grant Ward, a highly-trained specialist; held his own against a brainwashed Agent 33; and battled Calvin Zabo, a man with enhanced strength. He easily subdued Sebastian Derik, a highly trained assassin, after having been tortured by him. He fought Alphonso Mackenzie, who had enhanced strength while under the control of the Kree City. He also killed an LMD of Anton Ivanov after leaving the Framework.
Expert Marksman: Coulson was accomplished in the use of military assault weapons as well as edged weapons, and even wielded experimental weapons during some missions. He shot and killed John Garrett, Daniel Whitehall and Alisha Whitley. He was also accurate enough to shoot Absorbing Man in the head, but he survived by mimicking rubber.
Coulson's Level 6 S.H.I.E.L.D. identification
Master Spy: Coulson was highly trained in intelligence and espionage. He could tell what the man controlling Akela Amador looked like just by her description of how he typed. He maintained very good covers on multiple occasions, including when pursuing Ian Quinn on a train, at Cybertek's offices, and at Gabriel Soto's party in Miami, where he, along with Melinda May, were able to locate all the security cameras.
Gifted Intellect: To be added
Master Tactician: A very skilled logistics specialist, Coulson assessed situations and allocated equipment and personnel as needed. He was also very proficient at planning ops. He was a recognized expert on analysis, being able to imagine all the possible scenarios for any given information, and quickly predict the probable one, such as when he deduced that the Clairvoyant was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, or when he correctly guessed why Skye accompanied Grant Ward out of Providence, despite her knowing he was a HYDRA operative. He also exceled at tracking fugitives, locating Grant Ward in Tijuana when he was running from justice. Once he became the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Coulson developed plans and strategies that dealt severe blows to HYDRA and ended the threat posed by Jiaying and her community of Inhumans who wanted to wage war against S.H.I.E.L.D. Glenn Talbot referred to Coulson as his "best wingman" and declared him to be one of "the best military minds the world has to offer."
Expert Interrogator: Coulson's interrogation skills helped him piece together intelligence from small bits of information. While talking to Erik Selvig, Coulson knew that he was lying about the true identity of "Donald Blake". Coulson had figured out that Elliot Randolph was an Asgardian, based on his interrogation of Thor. While interrogating Glenn Talbot, Coulson knew what to say to get the emotional reaction he wanted to get Talbot's fingerprints. Coulson interviewed each member of his team to learn that Grant Ward's weakness was his love for his brother Thomas.
Multilingualism: Coulson was fluent in English and Spanish, though he referred to it as "vacation Spanish" because his pronunciation was very American. Coulson used this skill on multiple missions, especially in Peru, where he was stationed in 2002. He also spoke some Russian, but not fluently.
Equipment
Weapons


SIG Sauer P226: The SIG Sauer P226 was the standard pistol issued to S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel in the 1990s. Coulson used his to hold Nick Fury at gunpoint at the Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. Facility. He had orders to capture him for having sided with Carol Danvers. However, Coulson trusted Fury and let him go, telling the other agents that the stairs were clear.
Smith & Wesson M&P: The Smith & Wesson M&P pistol was the standard sidearm carried by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Coulson used his to threaten or shoot most of his enemies.
Smith & Wesson M&P Compact: Coulson used the compact version of the Smith & Wesson M&P pistol on some missions that required high mobility, such as the infiltration of the Guest House to obtain medical assistance for Skye who had been involved in a shootout with the security guards of the base.
Glock 17: The Glock 17 was the standard sidearm used by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, before being replaced by the Smith & Wesson M&P.  Coulson and a team of agents carried those weapons when they tried to capture Obadiah Stane, raiding Stark Industries sector 16, and when Coulson prevented a theft in a gas station in New Mexico. Coulson also took the gun that belonged to Briggs during the Blackout Attack in Miami. He took it to the location of the EMP device, but did not use it in the ensuing confrontation with the Watchdog guards.
Tokyo Marui Strike Warrior: Coulson obtained Luther Banks' handgun when he was tied up by the ATCU during his attempt to ambush Rosalind Price. Coulson removed his prosthetic hand and knocked Banks over, taking his gun and pointing it at the ATCU operatives inside the train while Lance Hunter summoned a Containment Module for their escape.
FN Five-seveN USG: The standard sidearm used by HYDRA operatives after its apparent demise and under Gideon Malick's leadership. Coulson took one of these weapons off one of the men sent to kill him when Rosalind Price was killed. He used it to defend himself and kill many of the Hydra operatives, until Alphonso Mackenzie extracted him. In the Framework, Coulson and Jemma Simmons took two of these handguns from the Quinjet on which they traveled to Ogygia with Grant Ward. They used the weapons to threaten Holden Radcliffe but had to hide when Madame Hydra and Leo Fitz arrived to the island. Coulson later used his to open fire on HYDRA members to escape after Fitz killed Agnes Kitsworth. He kept the gun for a subsequent mission to hijack a HYDRA prison transport.
Ruger P: Using her enhanced speed, Elena Rodriguez disarmed one of the gang members protecting Eli Morrow and put the Ruger P into Coulson's hands, who promptly shot at both men.
Heckler & Koch HK4: After Grill's death, Coulson took his gun, keeping it ready as members of the Kree Watch were looking for them. He later used it to shoot at Sinara while rescuing Flint.
Tokarev TT-33: Deke Shaw used to this handgun to threaten Samuel Voss.  Coulson later used the same gun when he liberated Voss, holding Voss at gunpoint to cuff him before sending him to the nearby caves for shelter.
Desert Eagle Mark XIX: Coulson was given this high-caliber handgun for protection when he went to close the rift in the  Fear Dimension. Deathlok arrived to help and they fought the manifestations of fear. Coulson used the gun to shoot and kill a Vrellnexian before closing the rift.
Heckler & Koch MP5A3: Coulson grabbed one of these weapons from an arsenal when he infiltrated the HYDRA Enlightenment Cultivation Center within the Framework. He did not have to use it, but he kept it in order to rescue his former students, later discarding it when the building was about to be destroyed.
Mossberg 500 Cruiser: Coulson and Lance Hunter took these shotguns to stage a jewelry store robbery, in order to kidnap Thomas Ward in a way that made him fear for his life. They wanted to make Grant Ward reckless and so they could locate him and get revenge for what he did to Rosalind Price and Bobbi Morse.
M4A1 Carbine: The standard weapon used by S.H.I.E.L.D. strike team members, that Coulson used while tracking Deathlok and the Clairvoyant in Florida, and during his attempt to defend Providence base from intruders.
IWI Tavor TAR-21: This firearm was the standard weapon carried by tactical agents of the S.H.I.E.L.D. faction led by Robert Gonzales, and it became the main weapon of all tactical agents when that faction reunited with the one led by Phil Coulson. Coulson took one of these weapons when he dressed as one of the tactical agents that were sent by Gonzales to trap him and Lance Hunter at the Retreat. Hunter tried to convince him that they should have used the weapons to escape, not knowing that Coulson had another plan in mind.
Heckler & Koch HK416: Coulson took one of these rifles from the mercenaries hired to kill Jeffrey Mace at Freyer National Park, and used it to defend his position from incoming enemies when they sought shelter in a cottage.
Orion Flare Gun: Coulson took this flare gun to the party where a Watchdogs squad led by Briggs was about to kill Elena Rodriguez, firing to distract them while he, Leo Fitz and Alphonso Mackenzie confronted them.
Thunderstick: Coulson was forced to use this device to defeat John Garrett, who had just revealed his true allegiance to HYDRA and his identity as the Clairvoyant. Coulson fought Garrett at the Hub, and finally defeated him by stunning him with the Thunderstick.
Night-Night Pistol: When Coulson needed to apply non-lethal force to subdue a target, he favored the use of the Night-Night Pistol designed by Agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons. Coulson used it on Akela Amador when she was fighting Agent Melinda May, rendering Amador unconscious.
I.C.E.R. (Pistol Version): The Incapacitating Cartridge Emitting Railguns were an upgraded version of the Night-Night Gun, invented by Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons. They became standard issue for S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Coulson used one in a gunfight against some men enthralled by the Asgardian Lorelei, to knock them out without killing them. Coulson also used one to incapacitate Glenn Talbot aboard the Bus after getting information from him. On another occasion, Coulson used an I.C.E.R. when he attempted to subdue Alphonso Mackenzie who was being controlled by the Kree City, but the weapon was ineffective against him. Coulson and Lance Hunter used I.C.E.R.s at the Retreat to defend against an ambush.
Destroyer Armor Prototype Gun: When Loki escaped confinement aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, Coulson retrieved the Destroyer Gun from secure storage. He confronted Loki with the weapon, but the trickster was actually behind Coulson and stabbed him in the back. Mortally wounded, Coulson managed to fire off one powerful shot that severely hurt Loki, but did not prevent him from escaping the Helicarrier. Coulson used the weapon again during the Battle at Cybertek, where he easily defeated a whole squad of enhanced Centipede Soldiers.
Peruvian 0-8-4: Coulson retrieved the Peruvian 0-8-4 from the Cybertek Manufacturing Facility, and used it to obliterate John Garrett, preventing Garett from reanimating as he had done after being killed by Deathlok.
Shotgun-Axe: While the Lighthouse was being attacked by the Confederacy, Alphonso Mackenzie lent his Shotgun-Axe to Coulson to use for defense as he could not use his prosthetic hand.
Other Equipment
Bulletproof Vest: Whenever appropriate, Coulson wore a bulletproof vest under his jacket during field missions.
Pick-Lock Device: One of Coulson's favorite gadgets was a small explosive device used to quickly destroy a door's locking mechanism. He used this device to infiltrate "Section 16" at Stark Industries Headquarters in Los Angeles during the operation to apprehend Obadiah Stane. He also used one to open one of the doors at the Centipede Project's laboratory in Hong Kong where Chan Ho Yin was being held captive.
Flash Bomb: Coulson used a Flash Bomb during the shootout at the Guest House, to blind one of the security guards and allow Grant Ward a clear shot at him.
QNB-T16 Truth Serum: A supposed truth serum that Coulson used on Grant Ward to earn Skye's trust. Ward later confessed to Skye that they had made it up to manipulate her. Coulson would neither confirm nor deny that the serum was bogus.
Cigarette Laser: Coulson took the Cigarette Laser from Antoine Triplett's Howling Commando Gear, during his mission to infiltrate Cybertek Corporate Headquarters. He used it to open a secure door inside the building and access the files about Project Deathlok housed in the room.
Overkill Device: Coulson, despite his new position as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., personally went to confront Carl Creel using an Overkill Device that had been modified by Leo Fitz to disrupt Creel's powers. Coulson ambushed Creel, who was preoccupied fighting Lance Hunter, and stabbed Creel with the device. The device turned Creel's body to stone, in the same way that the Obelisk effected the people who touched it.
Toolbox: When Nick Fury made Coulson the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., he gave him the Toolbox, a compact digital storage device containing all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s classified files, including many that were for the director's eyes only. In it, Coulson found the coordinates of the Playground which he designated as S.H.I.E.L.D.'s new headquarters, and he continued to refer to it whenever he needed information that did not appear elsewhere.


Prosthetic Hand: After Alphonso Mackenzie chopped off Coulson's left hand to stop the effects of the Terrigen Crystal, Leo Fitz designed at least three different cybernetic replacements for him. Coulson had trouble adjusting to the prosthetic hands, and stated that "nothing feels normal".
Metrics: In 2091 in an alternate timeline, Coulson had a Metric implanted in his wrist in order to blend in among the human population of the Lighthouse.
Framework Headset: The headsets were designed by Leo Fitz to enable the wearer to interact with the virtual world of the Framework. Coulson wore a headset when he was held prisoner inside the Framework by Aida.
Vehicles
S.H.I.E.L.D. SUV: The Sport Utility Vehicle was used by Coulson and his team as their main method of ground transportation. Coulson used the SUV to pursue Miles Lydon, but he evaded capture by using a computer program that caused traffic problems. Coulson and John Garrett reminisced about past assignments as they rode inside a S.H.I.E.L.D. SUV while searching for the Clairvoyant.
Quinjet: Coulson and Steve Rogers flew in a Quinjet to reach the Helicarrier. Later, Coulson sent members of his team to steal a Quinjet from a Government Storage Warehouse to get its cloaking technology to use on the Bus. When searching for the Kree City, Coulson, along with members of his team, took a Quinjet to San Juan. While pursuing Calvin Zabo, Coulson and Bobbi Morse took a Quinjet from Ohio to Wisconsin to battle the Slicing Talons. Coulson took Skye to the Retreat in a Quinjet, refusing to tell her where they were going for fear her uncontrollable powers would quake the plane apart. Coulson and team members flew the Quinjet to Milwaukee in pursuit of HYDRA scientist List who was experimenting on enhanced people. When Coulson surrendered to the agents of Robert Gonzales, he had Grant Ward land the Quinjet atop the Bus so the two S.H.I.E.L.D. factions could reunite and lead an Attack on the Arctic HYDRA Research Facility. While trying to locate Jemma Simmons,  Coulson brought Bobbi Morse and Leo Fitz aboard a Quinjet to England on the advice of Elliot Randolph, who was assisting them. Within the Framework, Grant Ward piloted a virtual Quinjet to bring Coulson and Jemma Simmons to Ogygia in search of Holden Radcliffe. However, when Madame Hydra and The Doctor arrived, the three were forced to escape the island on the Quinjet.
Helicarrier: While aboard the Helicarrier, Coulson helped Natasha Romanoff infiltrate Sojourn Enterprises at Vladivostok, informing her that Sofia had obtained the targeting system for Hammer Industries' version of the Jericho missile. On a separate occasion, Coulson accompanied Steve Rogers to the Helicarrier. They were greeted by Natasha Romanov who told Coulson he was wanted on the bridge to help in the search for Loki. He was later joined on the bridge by Rogers and Bruce Banner and Coulson asked Rogers to sign his Captain America Card Collection. Later, after they had captured Loki, Coulson discovered that Loki had escaped his cell, trapping Thor inside and was preparing to jettison the cell. Coulson threatened Loki with the Destroyer Armor Prototype Gun, but Loki tricked him and stabbed him in the back. Mortally wounded, Coulson still had the strength to shoot Loki and injure him, but he couldn't prevent Loki from jettisoning Thor's cell. Before Coulson Died, he told Nick Fury to use his death to motivate the Avengers to work as a team.
Lola: Coulson inherited his 1962 Chevrolet Corvette from his father, Robert Coulson. As a child, Coulson spent much of his free time helping his father restore it. He resented it at the time, but after his father died while Coulson was still a child, he appreciated the time they had spent together on the car and he kept Lola for the rest of his life as one of his most prized possessions. Coulson once allowed Melinda May to drive Lola during a mission in Madrid, but made her promise not to tell anyone. Coulson revealed Lola's flight capability to Skye when he was called back to the Bus to help with the identification of an 0-8-4. While in Mexico, Coulson and May used Lola to chase down former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Richard Lumley. During the HYDRA Uprising, Coulson rescued Skye who was being held captive by Grant Ward and Deathlok aboard the Bus. Coulson snuck on board, grabbed Skye and they jumped into Lola with Deathlok and Ward firing at them. Coulson fired back with the machine guns housed in Lola's headlights as he backed the car out of the cargo bay with the Bus in mid-flight. As the car plummeted, Skye fell out after not heeding Coulson's warning to "buckle-up". Coulson pulled her back in as he activated the car's flight mode and safely piloted Lola to the ground. Coulson and Alphonso Mackenzie drove Lola when they went to interrogate Eli Morrow in prison. When they were leaving, Mackenzie saw Robbie Reyes inside his Dodge Charger. When Reyes spotted them, he fled. Mackenzie wanted to drive Lola in pursuit, but Coulson would not let him. During the chase, Mackenzie lamented that Lola's flight function was not working. Coulson said it wouldn't be a problem, as Reyes crashed into a cloaked Quinjet.
Bus: Coulson was given the Bus by Nick Fury to serve as the flying command center for his team.  On their first mission together, Coulson and his team flew the Bus to Peru to retrieve an 0-8-4. After bringing the 0-8-4 aboard, the Bus was hijacked by Camilla Reyes and her men. During the fight to retake the Bus, an explosive was detonated that blew a hole in the side of the aircraft. Fury blamed Coulson for damaging the Bus after only six days in use. Coulson assured Fury that it wouldn't happen again. During the HYDRA Uprising, Grant Ward and Deathlok abducted Skye and held her captive on the Bus. Coulson rescued her and they escaped the plane on Lola.
Humvee: Cybertek security members employed Humvees in their manufacturing facility in New Mexico; one of which Coulson and Antoine Triplett procured at the beginning of the Battle at Cybertek in order to blast a hole for Melinda May and Skye to enter.
Iliad: To be added
Jeep: After escaping from Robert Gonzales' faction of S.H.I.E.L.D., Coulson and Lance Hunter stole a Jeep from Honest Eddie's Car Dealership and went to the Retreat to look for Skye.
Zephyr One: Coulson took Zephyr One to a meeting with President Matthew Ellis at NORAD, but en route, Alphonso Mackenzie and Lincoln Campbell boarded and said they suspected Andrew Garner of being Lash. Coulson diverted the plane to go apprehend him. After returning from the alternate timeline of 2091, Coulson and his team took the Zephyr to St. Louis to investigate a mysterious beam of light at an aerospace facility. They were attacked by Sleeper Mechs and used the plane to retreat to the Lighthouse. Coulson and Melinda May later used Zephyr One's cloaking capacity to capture General Hale. While Coulson interrogated Hale, Carl Creel threatened to blow up the plane. Zephyr One was then boarded by Anton Ivanov and Coulson was forced to leave the plane with Hale, Creel and Ivanov. Daisy Johnson and May took Zephyr One to search for Coulson. With the help of one of Robin Hinton's drawings, they succeeded in finding and rescuing him. After the Siege of the Lighthouse, Glenn Talbot used his new powers to fly himself and Coulson to Quovas' space ship. Mackenzie upgraded the Zephyr for space travel with RCS thrusters designed by Leo Fitz, and the team went to rescue Coulson and Talbot. While May and Johnson infiltrated Quovas' ship and rescued Coulson, Talbot attacked the Zephyr and stole the Quinjet. Coulson and Johnson made it back to the Zephyr while it was being attacked by Remorath soldiers. During the fight, Coulson passed out due to his failing health. They defeated the Remorath and returned to the Lighthouse. When Talbot was spotted in Chicago, Coulson was unconscious in the Zephyr's sick bay. Before the team left to deal with Talbot, Coulson regained consciousness and Jemma Simmons left a dose of Centipede Serum for him to take to save his life. He walked out of the sick bay, appearing to have taken the serum. When they arrived in Chicago, Coulson and Johnson took the Quinjet to confront Talbot. Johnson was able to defeat Talbot after finding the dose of Centipede Serum hidden in her gauntlet. While Johnson was fighting Talbot, Coulson collapsed on the Quinjet and James Davis piloted him back to the Zephyr where Yo-Yo Rodriguez gave him chest compressions to revive him. After the Battle of Chicago, the team held a retirement party for Coulson on the Zephyr, hanging a commemorative plaque in his honor on the plane. The Zephyr then carried Coulson to his final destination, the island of Tahiti, where he lived out his last days with May.
Containment Module: Trapped in a subway car in Washington, D.C., Coulson and Lance Hunter spoke with Rosalind Price while an agent of the ATCU inspected Hunter's backpack. The agent accidentally activated the summoning pod of the Containment Module, allowing Coulson and Hunter a means of escape that destroyed the subway car. Coulson later used the module to escape from the HYDRA Castle during the Attack on the HYDRA Castle.

Facilities
S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy: Coulson studied at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy of Communications, where he learned to be a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. The academy fell during the HYDRA Uprising. Years later, when the academy was rebuilt, it was rechristened in his honor as the Coulson Academy.
S.H.I.E.L.D. Crater Investigation Site: Coulson was stationed at a temporary S.H.I.E.L.D. investigation site in New Mexico due to the discovery of Mjølnir. Coulson oversaw the investigation until Thor attacked the site in an attempt to reclaim his hammer. Coulson monitored Thor's movements on the site, ready to let Clint Barton intervene if necessary. However, Thor failed to reclaim Mjølnir and was apprehended, enabling Coulson to interrogate him.
Guest House: Coulson was appointed the head of Project T.A.H.I.T.I. by Nick Fury. The project was conducted at the Guest House and the goal was to develop life saving medicine from the bodily fluids of a deceased Kree subject known as G.H.. Coulson oversaw the project but ultimately decided the side effects of the GH.325 were too dangerous. He resigned from the project and recommended it be terminated. When Coulson was killed by Loki, Fury had him brought to the Guest House and resurrected with the GH.325, then erased Coulson's memory of the procedure. Coulson, along with Grant Ward, Leo Fitz and John Garrett broke into the Guest House and took some GH.325, in an attempt to save Skye after she was shot by Ian Quinn.   They unintentionally activated a timed self-destruct device. Before fleeing the facility, Coulson found the Kree corpse and learned the secret of his own resurrection. The four narrowly escaped before the explosion destroyed the Guest House.
Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility: Talos, disguised as Keller, met with Nick Fury at this facility, planning to ambush Vers. Fury learned that Talos was an imposter and tried to flee the facility. Talos ordered S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to shoot Fury on sight. Coulson located Fury, but on hearing his friend's story, trusted Fury and let him go.
Hub: Coulson and his team traveled to the Hub and met with Victoria Hand who told them that a separatist group in South Ossetia was planning to use the Overkill Device to declare independence from Russia and Georgia. She sent Grant Ward and Leo Fitz to disarm the weapon. Skye hacked into the mainframe and discovered that there was no extraction planned for Ward and Fitz. She reported her findings to Coulson and he confronted Hand, who admitted it was true. Melinda May, Jemma Simmons and Skye returned to the Bus so they could go extract Ward and Fitz. They found Coulson waiting for them inside the Bus to join the extraction mission. After the HYDRA Uprising, the Bus was automatically rerouted to the Hub by Hand's order, as she suspected Coulson and John Garrett of being HYDRA agents. Upon landing at the Hub, Coulson, his team and Garrett avoided capture by using a Mouse Hole to exit the Bus unseen. They discovered where Hand was and Garrett tried to convince Coulson that they had to kill her because she was the Clairvoyant. During the conversation, Garrett let slip some information that Coulson had not told him, thereby revealing himself to be the Clairvoyant. Eventually, Hand took Garrett into custody and left Coulson in charge of the Hub, while she escorted Garrett to the Fridge for detention. Coulson later received a call from Glenn Talbot saying he was bringing a peacekeeping force to the Hub to take control. Coulson feared that Talbot intended to either attack the base or to subpoena everyone and tie them up in court for months. Coulson opted to enact the Odyssey Protocol and evacuate the Hub before Talbot arrived.
Providence: During the HYDRA Uprising, Coulson and his team went dark and sought refuge in Providence, one of Nick Fury's secret bases. Coulson remained in Providence for several days, where he strategized how to combat HYDRA and learned of Grant Ward's betrayal. He was ultimately forced to flee the base when Maria Hill sent in the United States Armed Forces.
Playground: When he was appointed Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Coulson discovered the coordinates of the Playground in Nick Fury's Toolbox. Coulson established the facility as the new S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters.  However, Coulson was forced to flee when the faction of S.H.I.E.L.D. led by Robert Gonzales attacked the Playground. Coulson later returned to the facility when the two factions merged and he continued to act as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. When he passed the position to Jeffrey Mace and returned to being a field agent out on assignment for long periods of time, he only returned to the Playground occasionally. Coulson later became de facto Director, but was kidnapped and replaced by an LMD. After he escaped from the Framework, Coulson returned to the destroyed Playground one last time for S.H.I.E.L.D.'s last battle against Aida.
Retreat: In exile during the S.H.I.E.L.D. Civil War, Coulson hid in the Retreat with Lance Hunter. When they were discovered, they escaped from the facility with help from Deathlok.
Lighthouse: Coulson was sent to the future Lighthouse by Enoch, where he blended in by working for Grill and was able to help the Humans living under the rule of the Kree Watch to reclaim control of their fate. Coulson then returned to his own time and he and his team took possession of the Lighthouse, making it S.H.I.E.L.D.'s base of operations. Knowing that he was dying, Coulson appointed his protégée Daisy Johnson to lead the team. Coulson oversaw the defense of the Lighthouse when the Remorath attacked it. Due to his failing health, Coulson eventually retired from S.H.I.E.L.D. and left the Lighthouse one last time before the Battle of Chicago.
Prisons
HYDRA Preparatory Academy: Captured by General Hale, Coulson was imprisoned in the HYDRA Preparatory Academy, where he learned about Hale's intention to reactivate Project Destroyer of Worlds. Coulson was able to escape from the Academy with fellow prisoner Glenn Talbot, thanks to the assistance of Carl Creel.
Ivanov Oil Platform: Having been abducted by Aida and her allies, Coulson was forcibly connected to the Framework, with the hardware being located in an oil platform owned by Anton Ivanov.
In the Framework
Alexander Pierce High School: In the Framework, Coulson lived a rewritten life as a history teacher at Alexander Pierce High School, where he taught HYDRA propaganda and did nothing to intervene when HYDRA operatives took away his pupils. Occasionally, Coulson stayed in his classroom after his students had gone home pondering items he had collected, unaware that they represented things from his real life. With the help of Jemma Simmons and Daisy Johnson, Coulson was able to regain some of his memories and he abandoned the school and joined the resistance.
Playground: Thanks to Grant Ward, Coulson was granted access to The Playground, the only remaining S.H.I.E.L.D. facility. There he helped the Patriot organize the resistance against HYDRA, providing shelter and comfort to victims of the regime.
Hobbies
Only a few of Coulson's collectibles
Coulson is an avid connoisseur and collector of antiques and memorabilia, particularly regarding S.H.I.E.L.D. and the history of espionage, knowing in detail the original specifications of such items as Elliot Randolph's Waterfield 44 pen or Antoine Triplett's Howling Commando Gear inherited from his grandfather.

Notable items in Coulson's collection have included all of the following:

Lola: The jewel of Coulson's collection, Lola is a vintage 1962 Corvette with modifications based on designs and technologies created by Howard Stark, including flight capability (VTOL).
Captain America Card Collection: A complete set of vintage Captain America trading cards from the World War II era. (Fury stained them with Coulson's blood, to motivate the Avengers; likely Coulson wouldn't want them back in a soiled condition.)
Walkie-Talkie Wristwatch: An original walkie-talkie wristwatch made in Poland in 1936. There were fewer than 20 ever made.
Metal Storm VLE Handgun: A prototype handgun that uses two 7-round 9mm barrels and two 3-round 15mm barrels for non-lethal ammunition.
Minox Spy Camera: A subminiature camera developed before World War II and favored by intelligence agencies due to its small size and macro focusing ability.
CXD 23 Airborne Mobile Command Station Scale Model: A scale model of The Bus rested in Coulson's desk in his office of the plane, and was moved to his new office in the Playground.
1962 Chevrolet Corvette Scale Model: A scale model of Lola rests in Coulson's office in the Playground.
Captain America's USO Poster: A promotional poster edited during World War II by the USO, displaying the motto "Trust Cap to lead the way".
Alphonso Mackenzie's Axe: An emergency handaxe that Alphonso Mackenzie used as a weapon when a group of Inhumans led by Jiaying attacked the Iliad, that Mackenzie had to use to cut Coulson's hand when he prevented a Terrigen Crystal from breaking, and his hand began to turn into stone. Coulson hung the axe in his office, as both a memento and a reminder.
Platinum Tie-clip Camera: A tie-clip used as a camera.
S.H.I.E.L.D. Pin: The personal pin of Peggy Carter, with the symbol of S.H.I.E.L.D. on it.
In addition to collecting items, he also stated that he played the video game Call of Duty, in a conversation with Eric, but in more recent days not so much.
