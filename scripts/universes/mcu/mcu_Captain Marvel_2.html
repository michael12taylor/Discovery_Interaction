<html><p>As soon as the Skrulls were out of danger, Danvers proceeded to deal with the various conflicts on multiple planets. Meanwhile, on Earth, the experiences with Danvers had led Nick Fury to realize that the world's arsenal would not be enough to defend mankind from intergalactic threats like the Kree, leading him to draft the Avengers Initiative, named after Danvers' old Air Force callsign, which eventually led to the formation of the Avengers team. Over time, Danvers started to go by Captain Marvel, in honor of her former mentor, as well as Fury's suggestion of the name "Marvel."

Infinity War
Thanos' Victory
Captain Marvel first meeting the Avengers
23 years after the Battle at Mar-Vell's Laboratory, Danvers suddenly received an emergency call from Nick Fury's Transmitter Pager. Responding to the signal, Danvers returned to Earth, whose population had been cut in half along with the rest of the universe, due to the Snap event. She tracked the pager's location to the New Avengers Facility, where Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, and James Rhodes were analyzing the device and receiving updates on the level of casualties caused by the Snap. Entering the facility, Danvers encountered the Avengers and confronted them about Fury's whereabouts.

Rescue of Tony Stark
Captain Marvel saves Tony Stark and Nebula
Shortly after meeting the Avengers, Danvers embarked into space to search for the team's missing members. Twenty-two days after the Snap, she found Iron Man and Nebula stranded in the Benatar after their own encounter with Thanos on Titan. She then carried the dying ship and its passengers across the galaxy to the Avengers Compound on Earth.

Captain Marvel brings the Benatar to Earth
As Danvers returned to the facility, she landed the Benatar right in front of the facility as Stark reunited with the rest of the Avengers while Nebula reunited with Rocket Raccoon, the only other surviving member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. They all then regrouped inside, where Danvers was informed by Romanoff of the Snap and the effects that have occurred since.

Danvers sadly sees a picture of Nick Fury
As the slide of pictures that were shown off from their system, Danvers watched sadly as a screen projection showed Nick Fury among the ones killed by the Snap. Danvers stayed silent as Stark ranted at Steve Rogers about their failure to stop Thanos and how the events of the Ultron Offensive and the Avengers Civil War had left them unable to stop him from wiping out half of all life in the universe.

Danvers watches Tony Stark getting angry
She then witnessed Stark collapsing due to his long duration in space. Danvers and the Avengers watched as Stark rested after Bruce Banner gave him a sedative to put him out for a while, giving him time to heal. James Rhodes then informed them that Stark will be out for the rest of the day. Still furious about Thanos' actions, Danvers planned to fly away again the next morning to track down the Titan and kill him herself.

Danvers discusses Tony Stark's recovery
However, Romanoff stopped her, informing her that they work as a team. Rhodes then asked Danvers if she knew where Thanos was, to which she told him she knows people who might. However, Nebula informed them not to bother, as she knew where Thanos was located. She and Rocket detected a power surge from the Garden, Thanos' retirement planet, indicating that the Titan had used the Infinity Stones again.

Danvers discusses the plan against Thanos
Danvers told them that they can get the Infinity Stones and use them to bring everyone back. When Banner expressed his concern on how this was going to end any differently than it did during the Battle of Wakanda, Danvers informed him that they didn't have her then and would be successful since they had her this time. An annoyed Rhodes then retorted back at her, asking about her absence from Earth all this time.

Danvers being admired by Thor
Danvers dryly responded that she had a responsibility to a multitude of other planets that did not have the protection of the Avengers. They all then agreed upon the mission. Before they left to confront the Mad Titan, Thor, having been silent during the discussion, stood up from his chair and tested Danvers by summoning Stormbreaker in front of her, which she did not even flinch from. He then admired Danvers and expressed his preference for her. With Rogers, Romanoff, Thor, Banner, War Machine, Rocket and Nebula, Danvers boarded the Benatar to find Thanos.

Ambush on Thanos
Captain Marvel teams up with the Avengers
After boarding the Benatar, Captain Marvel co-piloted the ship along with Rocket Raccoon. They then made their jump through the Universal Neural Teleportation Network and arrived at the Garden.

Captain Marvel giving a report to the Avengers
After arriving, Danvers informed them that she would do a recon of the area, during which she found no hostile forces defending Thanos' position. Danvers promptly reported back to the Avengers and informed them that Thanos was alone on the planet, to which Nebula stated was enough. Captain Marvel then launched a photon blast through his hut. She then subdued Thanos by wrapping herself against him, putting him in a headlock and pushing his left arm with the Infinity Gauntlet away with her leg to prevent him from closing his fist and utilizing the Infinity Stones. 

Captain Marvel subdues Thanos
While Captain Marvel choked Thanos, Bruce Banner in the Mark XLVIII armor assisted her by bursting through the floor of Thanos' campfire and grabbed his arm, with War Machine holding Thanos' other arm. The Avengers proceeded to interrogate Thanos on the whereabouts of the Infinity Stones. 

Captain Marvel interrogates Thanos
Much to their horror, they found the Infinity Stones were no longer in the Gauntlet. When Captain America asked where the stones were, Danvers demanded Thanos to answer the question. Thanos revealed that he had destroyed the Infinity Stones, claiming they no longer served a purpose to him "beyond temptation."

Captain Marvel learns that they have failed
The Avengers initially believed Thanos to be lying, although Nebula stated that while her father was many things, a liar wasn't one of them. Danvers could only watch on coldly as an enraged Thor decapitates Thanos. The Avengers, heartbroken, returned to Earth in defeat.

Member of the Avengers
Universal Responsibilities
Danvers a part of the new lineup of Avengers
With no more left to be done about the Snap, Danvers decided to join the Avengers, while also assisting other planets that were suffering similar crises to those of Earth.

Danvers during a meeting with the Avengers
In 2023, Danvers messaged Rocket Raccoon and informed him about a highly-suspect warship so he and Nebula went to check it out. However, the ship turned out to be an infectious garbage scow, which caused them to smell like garbage. During a holo-conference, Rocket and Nebula complained to Danvers about her sending them into such a situation.

Danvers gives Natasha Romanoff an update
When Natasha Romanoff asked Danvers if she was returning to Earth next month, she told her it wasn't likely. Rocket teased her and asked if she was going to get another haircut, she simply corrected him by calling him "fur-face." She informed the Avengers that the things that were happening on Earth were happening on thousands of planets and that she was needed elsewhere. Once the meeting concluded, Danvers, knowing that Romanoff would not like what James Rhodes was going to say to her, wished him luck.

Battle of Earth
Captain Marvel destroying the Sanctuary II
After the Avengers successfully resurrected the victims of the Snap with the Infinity Stones from the past, Thanos from an alternate 2014 traveled to the present and battled the Avengers and resurrected heroes. When Thanos ordered an airstrike on the battlefield, the attack soon changed to an incoming Captain Marvel, who returned to Earth to help fight. With ease, Captain Marvel crashed through the Sanctuary II, destroying it and saving everyone on the battlefield.

Captain Marvel tasked with the Nano Gauntlet
Now having joined the battle, Captain America informed Captain Marvel of their mission to return the Nano Gauntlet to the Quantum Tunnel in Luis' van. Captain Marvel flew to Spider-Man, who gave her the Gauntlet after introducing himself. The two then noticed the incoming horde of Thanos' army, which made Spider-Man unsure if she could get through it. Fortunately, Captain Marvel was assisted by a group of female heroes to help her clear through the horde and get to the van.

Captain Marvel protecting the Nano Gauntlet
The group of heroes then collectively charged at the horde, clearing the way for Captain Marvel to fly through at high speed. With the help of the other heroes, Captain Marvel was able to get past the horde and head towards the van. When Thanos attempted to stop her, Shuri, Rescue and Wasp blasted him away, but he was able to throw his sword at the van, destroying it before Captain Marvel could reach it.

Captain Marvel restraining Thanos' hand
The blast threw Captain Marvel away, separating her from the Gauntlet and briefly knocking her out. When she came to, Thanos had picked up the Gauntlet, so Captain Marvel flew at him, hitting him to his knees. The two then fought, but when Thanos grabbed her arm, he threw her away. Captain Marvel rushed back to stop the Mad Titan, who had now equipped the Gauntlet and was about to snap his fingers, but she was able to grab his hand.

Captain Marvel furiously beats down Thanos
As Captain Marvel held his fingers apart, Thanos attempted to headbutt her, but it did not affect her. Captain Marvel then used her superior strength to overpower Thanos, pushing him down as she levitated above him. Seeing he couldn't fight her, Thanos grabbed the Power Stone from the Gauntlet and used it to increase his strength as he punched her, which was powerful enough to send her flying far away from the battlefield.

Captain Marvel kneels before Iron Man
The battle was ultimately concluded when Iron Man obtained the Stones and wiped out Thanos and his army. However, this action cost Iron Man his life due to the power of the Stones. All of the heroes gathered around the fallen hero as he died, and following the actions of Hawkeye, they all knelt before him to show their respects for his sacrifice.

Tony Stark's Funeral
Danvers attends the funeral for Tony Stark
In the aftermath of the Battle of Earth, Danvers attended Tony Stark's funeral along with the rest of the Avengers and heroes she fought alongside, to pay her respects. Only knowing him during their first encounter, Danvers stood at the back and watched as those closest to Stark mourned him and laid his Arc Reactor in the lake. While at the funeral, Danvers briefly reunited with Nick Fury for the first time since 1995.

Return to Space
Meeting Shang-Chi
Sometime later, Danvers was contacted by Wong via hologram, as well as Bruce Banner, to meet Shang-Chi, as well as his friend Katy Chen, and discuss the Ten Rings. Neither Danvers or Banner were familiar with the Rings, only knowing they had existed for thousands of years, and that they were sending out a message, but did not know to where. Danvers was then abruptly called away, telling Shang-Chi that it was nice to meet him and that if he wished to speak to her further, he could get her number from Banner, and left the meeting.

Personality
Carol Danvers is an extremely stubborn and rebellious person. Due to being told what to do or what her limits are her entire life, she tends to act recklessly when attempting to do something, which often results in accidents. Having been repeatedly underestimated her entire life due to being a woman, Danvers never backs down from a challenge. She notably possesses a sassy and dry wit. Danvers is ultimately a very determined person, and although she often gets frustrated whenever she fails to do something, she always gets back up and tries again. Danvers' friends and relatives often mentioned that she had a short temper before being abducted by the Kree.

Though brash and prideful, Danvers has a hero's heart and is a loyal friend to the people she holds most dear. She regularly fights for the underdog, and for twenty-three years has acted as a cosmic Good Samaritan, offering her aid to planets all over the universe in need of a hero. Through sheer willpower, she overcame the Supreme Intelligence and was ready to take on Thanos himself to avenge her friends. Perhaps due to her abusive upbringing, Danvers seems to have an easier time interacting with children than most other adults, acting as an honorary aunt to young Monica Rambeau and quickly establishing a rapport with Talos' daughter and sixteen-year-old Peter Parker. During her brief meeting with Shang-Chi she similarly kept a casual friendly attitude with him and remarked that it was nice meeting him before she was called away.

Upon being kidnapped and misled by the Kree into becoming their soldier, Carol was completely indoctrinated into the teachings of the Kree Empire, firmly believing them to be noble warriors while also believing the Skrulls to be an evil plague. As "Vers," she was notably more stoic, owing to her handlers' insistence that her emotions make her weak. Even though she lost her memory due to the Kree wiping them from her mind, some of Danvers' traits remained, most notably her tendency to let her impulsive nature get the better of her, and her inability to let go of a strongly held conviction. After regaining her memories, Danvers returned to her more expressive self and became friendlier, though when in more serious situations she returns to her more stoic demeanor due to her military background.

Once she returned to Earth and recovered from her amnesia, Danvers felt guilt over her actions against the Skrulls and anger towards the Kree, believing that she needs to undo the wrongs she had committed and stand up against her oppressors. However, Danvers still retained some degree of respect for Yon-Rogg despite everything he did to her, as she chose not to kill him and instead sent him back to Hala with the warning that Danvers will expose the truth about the Kree's manipulative empire.

When Danvers unlocked the full extent of her powers after overcoming the Supreme Intelligence she became significantly more confident in herself and her abilities, as she casually took down the Starforce with a rather laid back attitude then boldly declared that she didn't need to prove herself to Yong-Rogg after defeating him with a single blast. Danvers' self-confidence was shaken after the Snap and started to give way to borderline arrogance in her desperation to somehow correct it. She coldly disregarded the other heroes' warnings. Aware of her power level relative to the others, Danvers regularly tried to work alone rather than integrate herself into the team. Still, she acknowledged that the Avengers have kept the Earth in good hands up to this point, and eventually established a rapport with her fellow heroes when they took on Thanos. Even after they failed to undo the Snap, Danvers joined the Avengers to keep a look out on the universe's status and grew to trust them, as she told Nebula and Rocket about what she suspected was a warship and appeared apologetic when they angrily confronted her over it being a garbage scowl, and despite maintaining distance, she was shown to know them well enough that she quickly noticed War Machine was about to say something Natasha won't like and soft enough to wish him luck.

When the Snap was finally reversed, Danvers showed a brighter and friendlier side to herself and became more extroverted. During the Battle of Earth, she placed her faith in her teammates and openly accepted help when she needed it, even from people whom she barely knew because they were all rallied behind the same cause. She also opted to stay for Iron Man's funeral out of respect for the fallen Avenger.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Hybrid Physiology/Cosmic Enhancement: Through her exposure to the Tesseract's extraterrestrial power via the destruction of the Light-Speed Engine, Carol acquired the ability to produce cosmic energies to no measurable bounds and manipulate them to her needs.  Danvers was later granted superhuman strength, speed, endurance, and reflexes following her blood transfusion with the Kree warrior, Yon-Rogg, on the planet Hala, which essentially turned her into a Kree-Human hybrid. She was also trained in the arts of battle by the Kree which had been practiced for years and began to rely solely on her fighting skills, strength, and photon blasts. Many years later, Danvers demonstrated much greater control over her powers, which makes her one of the mightiest heroes in the universe and allowed her to compete with a being as powerful as Thanos, as she was able to briefly overpower the Mad Titan until he was forced to use the Power Stone to punch her away. 

Captain Marvel restraining Thanos
Superhuman Strength: Due to the Kree blood running through her veins, Danvers possesses superhuman strength. With this, she was able to defeat many Humans, Skrulls and Kree with relative ease. Even before completely unleashing her incredible cosmic powers, she was already strong enough to defeat over a dozen Skrull soldiers without the use of her photon blasts. Her super strength generally allows her to send her opponents flying through the air with simple blows and kicks. When she and Nick Fury were escaping from several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Danvers was able to bend a metal bar to prevent the door from being opened. Her strength also extends to her ability to jump great distances. During her battle with Starforce, Danvers was able to knock Bron-Char back with a single punch, and uppercut Korath into the air and send him flying away with a kick.
Superhuman Durability: Danvers' skin density, muscles, and bones have increased exponentially due to her hybrid influenced physiology. As such, Danvers possesses resistance to blunt trauma, falls from high altitudes, Kree energy shots, and large explosions. During the mission to Torfa, Danvers was electrocuted by Skrull energy and was only momentarily stunned, before falling completely unconscious. When a Skrull hit her directly in the face with a cane, Danvers simply turned and hit back twice as hard. She also resisted the explosion of a Skrull space pod followed by an immense crash on the roof of a Blockbuster and was only slightly dazed but came out of it without a single scratch. Danvers' incredible durability even allowed her to hold the Tesseract with her bare hands without suffering any damage. She also resisted the attacks of her former Starforce comrades during combat, as well as withstanding the metals that Yon-Rogg controlled telekinetically with his Magnitron Gauntlets. She was also able to withstand heavy blows from Bron-Char's energy gauntlets.
Superhuman Speed: Danvers can move at great speeds. She can overwhelm several Skrulls, including Talos, in hand-to-hand combat, and easily dodged their wild attacks while landing her blows as well. While chasing a Skrull through the city of Los Angeles, Danvers was able to keep up with the speed of a train to finally get on top of it. She was also able to handle her former Starforce compatriots in combat, easily dodging their attacks.
Vers acrobatically sparring with Yon-Rogg
Superhuman Agility: Danvers has greater agility, dexterity, balance, and body coordination than a regular human being. During her training with Yon-Rogg, Danvers was able to do elaborate cartwheels and flying kicks against him. She was also able to dodge many of the Skrulls' punches and overcome them in her battle. She was able to easily keep up with and surpass the Starforce members, despite the great agility in combat shown by the latter.
Superhuman Stamina:  Due to her human-Kree hybrid heritage, Danvers' advanced musculature is considerably more efficient than that of normal humans. As a result, her muscles produce practically no fatigue toxins during physical activity compared to those of humans. Her virtually inexhaustible stamina enables her to exert herself at peak capacity for an undefined period of time and without tiring at all.
Superhuman Reflexes: Danvers can react to as well as dodge objects that travel at high speeds, with her dodging many of the blows of the Skrulls and later the members of the Starforce with relative ease and almost effortlessly. Also, while flying, she was able to dodge the gunshots of the Kree warship.
Regenerative Healing Factor: Due to the Kree blood running through her veins, Danvers can regenerate from injuries much faster than a normal human, with an example being that there was no scar after being directly hit in the face by a Skrull, who drew blood. Another example was her having fallen from a considerable distance through the roof of a Blockbuster, only for Danvers to recover quickly and without any injuries.
Longevity: Due to her Kree blood and cosmic augmentations, Danvers' aging process was extremely reduced, possibly even halted altogether. Her physical age and condition at the time of the Battle of Earth are still the same as it was when she got her powers over three decades beforehand.
Energy Absorption: After destroying the Light-Speed Engine's power core, Danvers became infused with the energy of the Tesseract. Due to this, her body is capable of passively absorbing most forms of energy and transforming it into her signature cosmic energy, which she can then use in a variety of ways. Due to this, Danvers is immune to most energy-based attacks, as she can absorb the energy and use it to strengthen herself, such as when she absorbed the energy of the blasts fired at her from the Sanctuary II.  However, Danvers does have her limits as she was unable to absorb the energy of the Power Stone when Thanos used it to punch her.
Cosmic Energy Manipulation: Following her victory over the Supreme Intelligence, Danvers gained control over this power without the help of the photon inhibitor and she became fully capable to summon this energy at will. Danvers can also envelope herself within her energy, which emits itself as a glowing aura surrounding her in a form known as Binary. This greatly increases Danvers' physical abilities, such as her strength and durability, as well as her photon blast, and gave her the ability to fly at incredible speeds, which is what allowed her to defeat the entire Starforce, destroy the ballistic missiles, as well as almost all of Ronan's fleet to the point that Ronan considered Danvers a weapon and swore to come back for her. Also, Danvers can accumulate her energy into her hands to increase the damage behind her blows. Danvers can also carefully use her energy by using it to block blows, such as when she blocked a strike from Korath's energy sword which likely would have cut her if she did not use her energy to shield her hand.
    Captain Marvel shooting her photon blasts  Photon Blasts: Danvers can fashion her cosmic energy into dense powerful photon blasts strong enough to pulverize concrete and metal or lighter blasts which only send opponents flying away into the air. During her training, Danvers used a blast that sent Yon-Rogg flying a considerable distance. She was able to send three Skrulls back and then use a blast to propel herself and not be sucked into space when she opened a hole in Talos' ship. During the pursuit of the Skrulls, Danvers was able to use her photon blasts to destroy a roof where a Skrull was attacking her as well as to destroy part of a tunnel and break the roof of a train to enter it. She could also use a photon blast to knock Talos down, which left him momentarily unconscious. After overcoming her fear and destroying the photon inhibitor, Danvers was able to release the energy as a shock wave that was powerful enough to knock down three members of Starforce and two Kree soldiers instantly. She was also able to effortlessly topple Yon-Rogg with a single shot that sent him flying several feet into the air. She also used a photon blast against Thanos, which he blocked with his left hand, which was wearing the Infinity Gauntlet.
Exothermic Manipulation: Danvers can accumulate the energy in her hands to burn, melt or traverse solid metals, such as steel doors, ceilings or walls. She used this ability to free herself from the restrictions that the Skrulls had placed on her. However, she could not free herself from the handcuffs, so she had to work hard to use her photon blasts. When demonstrating her powers to Monica Rambeau, she also used this ability to boil the water in a tea kettle.
Energy Channeling: Danvers can utilize her cosmic energy to regulate the functional usage of a mechanized appliance as well as modulate their energy output. This is usually accommodated by a flare-up of her cosmic energies whenever she uses her powers to their fullest ebb. Her energy could also cause interference and power surges in nearby technology, as was exemplified by what unlocking her full power did to not only Mar-Vell's lab, but also the Kree energy cuffs used to restrain her allies, and the force fielded cells containing the captured Skrulls, thereby allowing them to break out. While flying back down to Earth to face off with Yon-Rogg, her very presence was enough to cause the surrounding power lines to flare up with electrical energy until she landed and powered down. Danvers was also able to jump-start Yon-Rogg's pod by blasting it with a short pulse of her energy.
Binary Mode:     Captain Marvel goes Binary  Danvers can harness the power of her cosmic energy to greatly augment her physical attributes, such as her strength and durability, in a form referred to as Binary. For Danvers to acquire this state, she must produce a massive amount of cosmic energy to envelope herself within, which manifests as a glowing aura around her. In this state, her strength and durability are augmented notably so to the point where she could destroy a Kree Warship by flying straight through it, as well as stop a Kree ballistic missile from detonating on Earth by pushing them away. By producing enough cosmic energy, Danvers can become essentially invulnerable and incalculably strong, to the point where she could destroy the Sanctuary II with ease and effortlessly resist a headbutt from Thanos, leaving the Mad Titan shocked. Her photon blasts also become more powerful, to the point that she could destroy Kree Warships with a single blast. As Binary, Danvers' blows become vastly more powerful due to her accumulating a larger amount of energy within her hands, giving her blows the ability to stun incredibly durable beings like Thanos. In this state, Danvers' durability is also augmented to the point where she was unfazed by a headbutt from Thanos, much to the Mad Titan's surprise, and even resisted a direct blow with the Power Stone, appearing unharmed shortly after.
Self-Sustenance: With her full cosmic power unleashed, Danvers can survive out in the depths of space without any breathing equipment, having floated in front of the Skrull refugees' ship in the airless vacuum without her helmet activated.
Flight:     Captain Marvel flying through space  While enveloping herself with cosmic energy, Danvers can fly, glide and float through the air and vacuum of space without outside help. She can fly at incredible speed, allowing her to take off into the atmosphere and even outer space and land safely on the planet's surface with ease. She can also maneuver with great precision in any direction, as well as float in one place. She quickly mastered the power of flight to the point where she could fly to the outer edges of the atmosphere in seconds to destroy incoming missiles and ships sent by Ronan. Later, when she decided to help the Skrulls to find a new world to inhabit, she was able to fly next to the Skrulls' ship at the speed of light. She was also able to fly quickly in space to save Tony Stark and later as she circled Thanos' planet to see if there was any kind of security. During the Battle of Earth, Danvers was able to come directly from space.

Abilities
Vers punching the Skrull Spy
Master Combatant: Having been trained for six years by Yon-Rogg, Danvers is a highly trained unarmed combatant, as well as an expert of the Kree's unique martial arts. During her workouts, Danvers fought her mentor Yon-Rogg, though he had the upper hand. She is skilled enough to defeat almost two dozen Skrulls soldiers while she was handcuffed and could not use her photon blasts and even managed to dominate commander Talos with relative ease. During the pursuit on the train, Danvers was able to fight against the Skrull Spy on equal terms, although this time with less ease and ultimately didn't manage to defeat him. Later, with her new ability to manipulate cosmic energy being linked to her combat abilities, Danvers was able to defeat the other Starforce members, including Yon-Rogg, with ease and without much effort. Danvers was also able to subdue a weakened Thanos, by putting him in a headlock, long enough for the other Avengers to come to help her. During the final battle, Danvers was able to fight Thanos while almost managing to take away the Nano Gauntlet but was ultimately bested by him enhancing his strength with the Power Stone.
Marksman: Danvers is proficient at using weapons, as she used a Kree gun to threaten Yon-Rogg, then shot it at the Light-Speed Engine.
Master Acrobat: Danvers' years of experience have made her an accomplished acrobat. She is skilled above all in the use of parkour, managing to jump over several objects during the chase to a Skrull in the city of Los Angeles. Danvers is also very good at climbing tall structures quickly.
Danvers holds an aerial battle with Yon-Rogg
Master Pilot: Danvers is an extremely skilled pilot, having been trained in the Air Force. She easily piloted the improved aircraft with the energy of the Space Stone and even temporarily held her own in an aerial battle with Yon-Rogg, which demonstrates Danvers' incredible ability to fly. Even when under her Vers persona, Danvers could operate a Quadjet, a vehicle that would have been unfamiliar to a Kree, as if by instinct. Later, Danvers was able to pilot the Quadjet as they headed to Mar-Vell's Laboratory in outer space. Danvers was also able to co-pilot the Benatar, along with Rocket, as they made their way to Thanos' Farm.
Expert Engineer: Since returning to Earth, Danvers has demonstrated remarkable aptitude with enhancing Earth communications technology, such as a payphone or Nick Fury's pager, into a highly advanced intergalactic communicator.

Other Equipment
Danvers wearing her new uniform
Starforce Uniform: Danvers possesses a uniform she used on her missions within Starforce and wears as Captain Marvel. The uniform contains a device capable of analyzing and identifying any object placed within it on the uniform's sleeve. The uniform's color scheme can also be customized to the user's preferences via a device located on the uniform's sleeve, which Danvers took advantage of when she had decided to defect and no longer felt morally comfortable wearing Kree colors. The uniform also includes a collapsible helmet that can fit around the wearer's head and leaves some of Danvers' hair exposed in a mohawk. The helmet can generate its atmosphere and allows the wearer to breathe in the vacuum of space, as well as underwater, where it will give off a blue glow to provide light. Five years after the Snap, Danvers changed the colors of the costume again; she changed part of the chest, shoulder pads, neck, gloves, and boots to blue, and the rest to the color red. Also, she added new accessories, like a sash on her belt.
Translator Implant: Danvers possesses a universal translator that allows her to comprehend most any languages and speak it fluently as well.
Photon Inhibitor: This device was utilized by the Supreme Intelligence to keep Danvers' powers in check and ensure she would not lose control of them. The device was able to limit the amount of energy Danvers' could emit and even revoke this power entirely. The device could also limit Danvers' physical abilities such as her strength and durability because they are directly proportional to how much cosmic energy Danvers produces. Danvers eventually destroyed the device out of defiance, unlocking her true potential.
Danvers holding the Tesseract
Tesseract: The Tesseract was the housing unit for the Space Stone that was discovered by Carol Danvers. She stopped her former Starforce teammates from taking it and then tried to give it to Nick Fury, only for Goose to swallow it with her tentacles.
Transmitter Pager: A communication device used by Nick Fury, which is an ordinary Earth pager modified by Carol Danvers using Kree technology so that she could be contacted by Fury as a last resort in extreme emergencies.
Vehicles
F-15C Eagle: During her tenure as a pilot within the United States Air Force, Danvers flew her own F-15C Eagle, in which her rank, name, and call-sign were adorned on the left side directly under her cockpit's canopy glass.
Helion: During missions with the Starforce, Danvers was transported on this ship with her former teammates.
Skrulls' Ship: After being captured by the Skrulls on Torfa, Danvers was brought on their ship and had her mind probed. Danvers later escaped and destroyed the ship before escaping in a space pod.
Space Pod: During her escape from Talos' ship, Danvers used a space capsule, which was destroyed upon reaching Earth's atmosphere, which ended in the arrival of Danvers to this planet.
Motorcycle: When she decided to go to Pancho's Bar to find out more about her past, Danvers stole a motorcycle which she drove relatively easily.
Quadjet: During the escape of her and Nick Fury from the Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility, Danvers piloted this ship with great skill. Later she used it to travel to Mar-Vell's Laboratory with her allies.
Benatar: While heading to Thanos' Farm with the other Avengers, Danvers co-piloted the ship, next to Rocket.
Facilities
Edwards Air Force Base: Danvers, along with Maria Rambeau, was stationed at this U.S Air Force base as test pilots, as the test flights of the Light-Speed Engine were performed from the base.
Rambeau Residence: After Danvers and Nick Fury inspect the archives at the Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility, they found out that one of the last persons to see Danvers alive on Earth was Maria Rambeau, so the two headed to her residence in Louisiana in search of answers. After she defeated the Kree forces attacking Earth, she celebrated their victory with her allies in Rambeau's house.
Mar-Vell's Laboratory: Danvers traveled to her late mentor's laboratory with her allies to find the Tesseract and a group of Skrull refugees. They were ambushed by the Starforce who captured Danvers, but she broke free and escaped with her allies, unlocking her full range of powers in the process and engaging in an all-out battle with the Starforce, defeating them.
New Avengers Facility: Danvers tracked the Transmitter Pager to this facility after Fury used it to call for her help. After meeting the Avengers, she left to rescue Iron Man. She eventually found him in space with Nebula and carried them to this facility, where they discussed how to handle the Snap and Thanos.
Thanos' Farm: Following the Snap, Danvers and the Avengers traveled to Planet 0259-S where Thanos resided with to ambush him and retrieve the Infinity Stones to undo his actions. However, Thanos destroyed the Stones to prevent them from being used again.

Trivia
In the comics, Carol Danvers is the seventh holder of the "Captain Marvel" title, after Mar-Vell. She obtained powers after a fusion of Kree and human genes, assuming the codenames Ms. Marvel, Binary and Warbird before becoming Captain Marvel, after the Avengers vs. X-Men comic event where Mar-Vell died while going up against the Phoenix Force. However, The Life of Captain Marvel storyline eventually reveals the origins of Carol and her siblings as Human-Kree-hybrids from their Kree mother, Mari-Ell (Earth name: Marie), with Carol's Kree name is Car-Ell, and the radiation powers which Mar-Vell absorbed and transferred to Carol body was only awakened her Kree gene.
In Avengers: Endgame, Danvers sported several physical features that referenced her classic appearance in the comics, such as the iconic short hair and the sash on her belt.

Danvers is a fan of Guns N' Roses and Lita Ford.
In the flashbacks to young Danvers playing baseball with her brother, she wears a red and white uniform while Steve wears the "B" of the Boston Red Sox. This is a nod to the comics, where the Danvers siblings grew up in Boston, Massachusetts.
Captain Marvel is the fourth character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe whose powers come from an Infinity Stone, following Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, and Vision. Unlike the other three, hers come from the Space Stone rather than the Mind Stone.
Behind the Scenes
According to Kevin Feige in his Phase Three announcement, Carol Danvers is "one of the most, if not the most, powerful heroes in the MCU."
Captain Marvel was originally in the Avengers: Age of Ultron script, but she was removed as it was deemed inappropriate to introduce her without establishing her backstory.
Carol Danvers was also originally going to appear in Jessica Jones when it was going to air on ABC, however, her role was eventually filled by Trish Walker.
Ronda Rousey, Katheryn Winnick, Natalie Dormer, Emily Blunt, Katee Sackhoff, Yvonne Strahovski and Rebecca Ferguson were considered for the role of Carol Danvers.</p></html>
