<html><p>As the pair got cleaned up, Rogers spoke to Romanoff and asked if she was okay following what they had learned about S.H.I.E.L.D. and all that had been going on behind the scenes. Romanoff admitted how she had thought she was fighting the good fight by joining S.H.I.E.L.D., but now felt she had just traded the KGB for HYDRA. Romanoff expressed how she now struggled to understand who exactly she had been lying for and whether she was fighting for the wrong side.

Rogers speaking with Natasha Romanoff
Romanoff then noted that Rogers had saved her life and questioned if it had been the other way around, would he have ever trusted her to save his. Rogers assured her that he felt he could following this conversation. Lightening the mood, Romanoff joked that Rogers seemed chipper for the man who just recently learnt he had died for nothing following World War II's conclusion before they were then interrupted by Wilson inviting them to breakfast.

Rogers discusses their next course of action
Sitting down to discuss the situation, they agreed that the air-strike would have been ordered by Alexander Pierce, and they would have to find a high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D./HYDRA agent to learn more. As Rogers and Romanoff realized that Jasper Sitwell was also clearly involved with Pierce's operations, Wilson revealed that he was part of the military project called EXO-7 Falcon, testing of a new form of winged Jet-Packs, and agreed to help Captain America in whatever way he could.

Threatening Jasper Sitwell
Rogers and Romanoff question Jasper Sitwell
The team then traveled back to Washington, D.C. in order to corner and talk to Agent Jasper Sitwell, following their recent discovery that he had been secretly working for HYDRA all along. They waited until Sitwell finished his private meeting with Senator Stern, who whispered “Hail HYDRA” to Sitwell as a sign of his loyalty before saying goodbye. Taking advantage of Sitwell being on his own, Sam Wilson then personally called up Sitwell and forced him up on the roof of a tall building nearby their location, under the threat being shot at by a sniper if he attempted to disobey.

Rogers threatening Jasper Sitwell's own life
Together with Natasha Romanoff, Rogers had dragged Sitwell onto the roof and demanded that he tell them everything he knew about Arnim Zola's algorithm, although Sitwell denied all knowledge, also denying he had been onboard the Lemurian Star for any reason. When Sitwell pointed out that Rogers was not the kind of man to push him off the roof, Rogers simply handed him over to Romanoff to kick off the edge before Falcon caught Sitwell and brought him back up.

Rogers and Romanoff question Jasper Sitwell
Terrified, Sitwell proceeded to reveal that Zola's algorithm could calculate if a person would be a threat to HYDRA in the future. He also told them that HYDRA was soon going to use Project Insight as a weapon to eliminate everyone who they saw as their opponent, mentioning Tony Stark and Bruce Banner as some of their planned targets along with Stephen Strange. This would also mean that millions of innocent people would die as a result.

Battle of Washington, D.C.
Rogers takes Jasper Sitwell to the Triskelion
The group took Jasper Sitwell into their custody and began driving towards Washington, D.C.. As they drove, Rogers explained his plan to use Sitwell to gain them access to the Triskelion and force him to shut down Project Insight before it had the chance to be activated. Sitwell, however, exclaimed that this was a terrible idea that would never work, though Rogers and the others simply ignored him and continued driving.

Rogers escapes from Winter Soldier
However, before they could all reach the Triskelion and continue with their plan, they were attacked by Winter Soldier and his men, who had been seemingly sent by Alexander Pierce. Before the group even had a moment to react, Sitwell was then ripped out of the car and killed by being thrown into traffic. The Winter Soldier then shot into the car and proceeded to rip out the vehicle’s steering wheel, which caused them to lose control and crash the car on the road.

Rogers and Romanoff face Winter Soldier
Rogers, however, had saved his allies by kicking open the car door and allowing them to ride it onto the road to relative safety while their car crashed multiple times, leaving them to face the Winter Soldier and his team of HYDRA soldiers who had instructions to kill them all. The battle broke out and Rogers saved Natasha Romanoff when he had managed to block a grenade blast, fired by the Winter Soldier, with his own shield. The subsequent explosion knocked Rogers off the bridge and into an oncoming bus, briefly taking him out of the clash and leaving his allies to fend for themselves against Pierce's soldiers, who immediately began firing upon them without any sense of mercy.

Rogers is shot at by armed HYDRA soldiers
Once Rogers had come to, he was almost immediately fired at by a HYDRA soldier armed with a minigun, but Rogers regained his shield and blocked the bullets before he subdued the soldier while being aided by Sam Wilson, who kept all the soldiers at bay after stealing one of their guns and firing back at them. With the HYDRA mercenaries being dealt with, Rogers then began chasing after the Winter Soldier who was now attempting to assassinate Romanoff.

Rogers comes to Natasha Romanoff's rescue
Rogers soon found Romanoff using her bites to try and defeat the Winter Soldier herself, but she was then shot through the shoulder and defeated. Before she could be executed, Rogers charged in and ambushed the Winter Soldier, blocking a strike from his prosthetic arm with his own shield. Having deflected the punch, Rogers was then kicked off the car roof before being shot at by the Winter Soldier, but he managed to block the shots with his shield.

Rogers blocks Winter Soldier's gunshots
Winter Soldier proceeded to use every weapon he had available to him to attack Rogers, although he was still unable to get a clean shot as Rogers continued using his shield to defend himself before fighting the Winter Soldier more directly. The Winter Soldier briefly managed to get his hands onto Rogers’ shield, which he had proceeded to launch at Rogers before their fight then continued, with the shield becoming embedded in the side of a nearby van.

Rogers is attacked by Winter Soldier's knife
While they fought, Rogers did everything he could to defend himself while the Winter Soldier drew a blade and then began slashing at Rogers in an attempt to kill him. However, both had quickly proved themselves almost equally matched as neither could land a final hit against the other. As their battle escalated, Rogers managed to get some defensive blows in against his enemy before kicking him into a nearby parked van and attempting to finish the fight.

Rogers being choked by Winter Soldier
The pair were forced to resort to hand-to-hand combat as the Winter Soldier had struck back against Captain America, managing to avoid being slammed to the ground before using his bionic arm to attempt to strangle the Captain before then throwing him across a car. Once Captain America was briefly defenseless on the floor, Winter Soldier attempted to finish the job by striking a hard blow but he missed and instead cracked the concrete as Rogers moved out of the way.

Rogers is almost stabbed by Winter Soldier
Rogers found that the longer the fight went on, the more aggressive Winter Soldier became as he was seemingly incapable of allowing his target to live. As the Winter Soldier continued striking Rogers, he drew another knife before pinning Rogers against a nearby van. Using his robotic arm to give him even more strength, Winter Soldier plunged his knife into the van and tore through the metal, as Rogers avoided the blade and then threw the Winter Soldier off him.

Rogers damages Winter Soldier's bionic arm
While the Winter Soldier was getting back onto his feet, Rogers was able to reclaim his shield, which was still embedded in the nearby van, as he blocked all of the Winter Soldier's continued strikes with his knife. Despite the Winter Soldier continuing to become more enraged by the fight, Rogers was able to dodge one blow before then embedding his shield into the Winter Soldier's bionic arm, causing serious damage and giving Rogers a clear advantage.

Rogers learns that Bucky Barnes is still alive
Eventually, Rogers had managed to throw the Winter Soldier over his shoulder which had resulted in his assailant’s mask being ripped from his face, revealing that he was in fact Bucky Barnes. When a horrified Rogers called his name, Winter Soldier replied did not know who that was before attempting to shoot Rogers again. Just then, Falcon kicked Winter Soldier over from mid-air and Romanoff drove him off with the grenade launcher which he had dropped earlier, while Rogers was still left in a shocked silence.

Rogers is finally captured by Brock Rumlow
While Rogers was still distracted by the revelation, they were quickly surrounded by Brock Rumlow and his STRIKE agents. Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson were then arrested by all of Rumlow's men, with Jack Rollins keeping his gun trained on Rogers' skull despite Rumlow ordering him not to kill Rogers there as there were too many cameras. Rogers did not resist as he wondered how Barnes had survived since World War II and was now the Winter Soldier.

Nick Fury's Survival
Rogers considers Bucky Barnes' survival
While in the HYDRA van being driven away by Brock Rumlow to an unknown location in order to execute them, Rogers then discussed how Bucky Barnes had survived since World War II. While they were speaking, one of the HYDRA guards suddenly tased the other and revealed herself to be Maria Hill. She then used a Mouse Hole to help them escape before Rumlow discovered the deception.

Rogers learns that Nick Fury is still alive
Agent Hill took them all to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Dam Facility where they immediately called on Doctor Fine to treat Natasha Romanoff's wounds. Upon their arrival, Hill showed them into the room where Director Nick Fury was resting, revealing that he did not die and had survived with the aid of Fine as well as the use of Bruce Banner's Tetrodotoxin B, though he was still severely injured due to the gunshots through his chest.

Rogers talks to Nick Fury in the secret base
The group discussed Alexander Pierce's plans and how HYDRA had used Barnes and Arnim Zola to finally achieve their goals of controlling the world. Hill and Fury told them that Project Insight was only hours away from launching and that they had to act quickly in order to save millions of lives. The Helicarriers would hover in a triangle, connected, locking on all of their targets before firing. The only way to prevent this would be to use three special chips that would take away S.H.I.E.L.D.'s control of the Helicarriers. Rogers then demanded that they also destroy S.H.I.E.L.D. in this mission as he blamed them for the disaster, which Fury eventually agreed to.

Rogers is given advice from Sam Wilson
Stepping outside, Rogers thought back to living in Brooklyn shortly after his mother had died, and how Barnes had been there for him at that time. Rogers was then joined by Sam Wilson, who reminded Rogers that when they went into the mission, Barnes would be there waiting for them as Winter Soldier and Rogers would need to stop him. Rogers insisted he could still save his friend despite Wilson’s warning that he may not have any choice with that.

Captain America arrives outside the Triskelion
Rogers told Wilson to collect his EXO-7 Falcon to be ready for their mission, noting that if they were to fight in a war then they would need to have a uniform. Having lost his suit earlier in order to avoid detection, Rogers broke into the Smithsonian Institution museum and stole his suit from World War II. After which, the group went off to stop Project Insight, arriving just outside of the Triskelion in order to complete their mission and save humanity’s freedom.

Battle at the Triskelion
Captain America breaking into the Triskelion
With both Sam Wilson and Maria Hill by his side, Captain America then successfully broke into the Triskelion, all while Black Widow was infiltrating a meeting with the World Security Council by using the Photostatic Veil to disguise herself as Hawley. In the meantime, Captain America managed to take over the control room with ease by banging on the door and waiting for Agent Moore to investigate before finding himself being held at gunpoint by the three heroes.

Captain America tells S.H.I.E.L.D. the truth
Rogers used the PA system to send out his message across the base and inform the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents listening of HYDRA's infiltration within their organization, and that Alexander Pierce was their leader, with Brock Rumlow's STRIKE unit also being HYDRA. Rogers told everyone that HYDRA was responsible for Director Nick Fury's apparent assassination and that they could not allow the HYDRA to initiate Project Insight, before asking them to stand with him.

Rogers and Falcon attacking the Hellicarriers
Once he had finished his speech, Captain America and Falcon prepared to assault the Helicarriers and battle all the HYDRA agents on board to ensure they could not complete Pierce's plan to use Arnim Zola's algorithm to murder several million people across the world, which included their fellow Avengers. While they ran towards the Helicarriers, which were just beginning to launch, Falcon questioned how they would be able to tell the good guys from the bad guys as everyone appeared to be S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, before Captain America simply told him to look for the agents shooting at them. With that, Wilson used his EXO-7 Falcon to fly up overhead and battle the Quinjets which were now being sent to kill them.

Captain America fights against HYDRA agents
While Falcon flew overhead, Captain America leaped onto a nearby launching Helicarrier where he had charged towards all the HYDRA agents who had been sent to stop him. Without breaking his pace, Captain America avoided the gunfire while using his shield and his own superior skills to strike back against his enemies. While he was fighting, Hill reminded Rogers that they only had eight minutes left in order to complete their infiltration mission.

Captain America hacking into the Helicarrier
Having managed to take out the HYDRA agents on the Helicarrier, Captain America ran into the main weapons center where he then inserted the chip which would allow them to force the three Helicarriers to target each other. Hill then confirmed with Wilson that they had managed to insert two of the chips, with some hardship, leaving just one more to be inserted in order to fully thwart Project Insight and save millions of innocent lives from HYDRA.

Captain America is rescued by Wilson
Although he had successfully placed their computer chip, Captain America was soon discovered by all the remaining HYDRA agents on board the Helicarrier who began firing at him. With little time to spare, Captain America requested Falcon's help as he leaped from the Helicarrier and plummeted towards Washington, D.C. several hundred feet below. Falcon managed to catch up in time and pulled Captain America all the way back up to the third and final Helicarrier.

Captain America almost falls to his death
However, before they could enter the Helicarrier, the pair were ambushed by Winter Soldier who pushed Captain America overboard and damaged Falcon's wing suit before also kicking him overboard. Wilson fell back to the Triskelion, where he got caught up in a fistfight with Agent Rumlow, while Rogers nearly fell to his death, but he was able to hang onto the Helicarrier. Now it was all on Rogers to complete the plan and defeat HYDRA.

Duel in the Helicarrier
Captain America confronts the Winter Soldier
Captain America entered the Helicarrier in order to put their final chip in place before he was confronted by Winter Soldier, who stood firmly in his way. Rogers desperately begged Barnes to listen to him, noting that Project Insight would soon kill millions of innocent lives. However, Rogers saw that Barnes was simply not going to listen to reason and, running out of time, Captain America then steeled himself for what must be done in order to complete his current mission.

Captain America fights Winter Soldier
Despite what Rogers wanted, the two former friends fought violently against each other, as Captain America began the fight by launching his shield at the Winter Soldier, which his opponent blocked with his bionic arm before they began their struggle. Rogers used his shield to block all the Winter Soldier's gunshots before then disarming him and attempting to keep him away while he rearmed the Helicarrier.

Rogers blocking the Winter Soldier's gunshots
The pair then battled each other over control of the chip; the Winter Soldier responded by throwing Captain America off the ledge before they continued their fight, with Rogers desperately attempting to keep the chip safe from harm. In his attempt to win their fight, the Winter Soldier launched Rogers' shield at him, before firing at him again, which Rogers managed to block with his shield before launching his shield back at the Winter Soldier who used his arm to block the blow.

Captain America subduing the Winter Soldier
Following a long and brutal battle between the pair where the Winter Soldier attempted to kill his target while Captain America tried to emotionally reach him, the Winter Soldier managed to get his hands on the chip, before Captain America had put him into a tight chokehold and demanded that he drop it. Captain America finally managed to subdue the Winter Soldier, by choking him out until the Soldier lost consciousness and dropped the chip.

Rogers orders Maria Hill to fire the weapons
Rogers attempted to get the chip into place with only seconds left before Project Insight would initiate. However, he was shot multiple times by the Winter Solider, with one bullet that went through his stomach. Using whatever energy he had left, Rogers managed to get the chip in place just in time, allowing Maria Hill to gain control of the Helicarriers. Before making them fire on each other, Hill had acknowledged that Rogers was still on board, but he commanded her to do it anyway.

Rogers manages to save Winter Soldier's life
With Rogers still on board, their mission went ahead exactly as they had planned, with all of Alexander Pierce's Helicarriers firing at one another. The Helicarrier that Rogers and Barnes were in was the last one remaining while the other two were blown out of the sky. Their Helicarrier crashed into the Triskelion, causing it to collapse and crush Brock Rumlow under the debris. As the Helicarrier had still continued to fall, some debris landed on Barnes, trapping him against the glass windows.

Rogers refuses to fight Bucky Barnes anymore
Running to his friend's aid, Rogers had freed the trapped Winter Soldier who immediately betrayed him, despite Rogers insisting that the Winter Soldier did indeed know who he was. Rogers desperately tried to remind the Soldier that his name was James Buchanan Barnes, telling him of their friendship in the 1940s. While the Winter Soldier now attacking Captain America, Rogers still refused to fight Barnes, dropping his shield and allowing Barnes to secure an easy victory.

Rogers allowing Bucky Barnes to defeat him
Refusing to accept the truth about his past, the Winter Soldier began to savagely beat Rogers with his metal arm, determined to complete his mission to kill Captain America for HYDRA. Before Rogers had lost consciousness from the brutal assault, he promised Barnes to be with him until the end of the line; a promise Barnes once gave him decades ago in 1936 following Sarah Rogers' funeral. This caused Barnes to realize what he was doing to his long-time friend.

Rogers saved from drowning by Bucky Barnes
However, just as Barnes came back to his senses and stopped his attacks, a large piece of debris fell and caused the floor to collapse underneath them. The unconscious Rogers then fell into the Potomac River below and nearly drowned, but Barnes decided to not leave his old friend to die and dived in, saving him. Barnes then dragged Rogers back to the shore and walked away, leaving Rogers to be found by the authorities while Barnes had then disappeared.

Search for the Winter Soldier
Rogers wakes up while inside the hospital
Rogers eventually woke up sometime following the Battle at the Triskelion in a hospital, finding Sam Wilson at his bedside and calling out "on your left" again. Wilson then filled Rogers in on what had happened after he was found; S.H.I.E.L.D. had gone through some major changes, having been dismantled as a result of the HYDRA Uprising. Having successfully killed Alexander Pierce during the battle, Nick Fury was officially dead, and he had destroyed all evidence of his survival. 

Rogers and Sam Wilson by Nick Fury's fake grave
Later, standing by his headstone, Fury ordered Rogers to tell anyone who asked that he was dead as he left to thwart HYDRA operations in Europe. Meanwhile, Natasha Romanoff went to a Senate hearing to defend their actions, proclaiming that they could not arrest the Avengers because the team is the best qualified to protect the world. After Romanoff gave him a file on Bucky Barnes, Rogers decided to start looking, with the help of Wilson, for his friend so that he could convince Barnes of who he really was and save him.

War on HYDRA
Capturing Baron Strucker
Rogers leading the assault on a HYDRA base
As Rogers continued his search for Bucky Barnes, the continued threat of HYDRA still endured, causing the Avengers to reassemble in bring an end to the terrorist organization. During one mission, the Avengers helped Black Widow fight Jensen whose soldiers were enhanced with HYDRA Exo-Suits. Eventually, Rogers led the Avengers in an assault on Baron Wolfgang von Strucker's base, having learned that Strucker was using the Scepter to create an army of his own enhanced soldiers for HYDRA to use against their enemies.

Rogers riding into Baron von Strucker's base
Rogers rode his motorcycle into their battle against Strucker's soldiers, throwing his shield at the HYDRA soldiers while commanding the Avengers' actions. When Iron Man cussed while trying to break through the base's defense systems during the battle, Rogers told him to mind his language, much to Stark's amusement, while Rogers checked with J.A.R.V.I.S. about Strucker's technology and the defense systems the base currently had in place.

Captain America fighting alongside Thor
While Rogers defended calling Stark out on his language, he then threw his motorcycle at another HYDRA convoy. When they realized Strucker's guns were targeting the innocent people of Sokovia, Stark then sent the Iron Legion to protect the people. Rogers ignored the continuing teases and fought alongside Thor, using their combined strength to destroy the HYDRA Tanks, also jokingly commenting that it had seemed like the soldiers were lining up to be defeated.

Captain America breaks into Strucker's base
During the continuing battle, Hawkeye was injured when he had been suddenly attacked by Pietro Maximoff and then took a shot from one of Strucker's bunkers. Captain America himself was also then briefly attacked by Maximoff, who he noted was too fast for him to even see and warned the other Avengers. With little time to spare, Rogers had ordered Thor to take Hawkeye onto the Avengers' Quinjet to receive treatment while they continued the assault on Strucker's base.

Captain America confronting Baron Strucker
Once Iron Man had successfully destroyed their defenses, Captain America broke into the HYDRA Research Base and began searching for Loki's Scepter. During his search, Rogers was informed by Black Widow that the battle had been one, as Rogers ordered her to collect Hulk and return him back to Bruce Banner. Before long, Rogers located Baron Wolfgang von Strucker who immediately surrendered to him, knowing that he did not stand a chance for victory.

Captain America beats Wolfgang von Strucker
During his confrontation with Baron von Strucker, Rogers was then attacked by Wanda Maximoff who used her powers to throw Rogers down a flight of stairs before making her own escape. Rogers quickly recovered from the attack and knocked out Strucker by hitting him with his shield, and took him into their custody while all of the rest of the Avengers had successfully defeated the remaining HYDRA army and Tony Stark found the Scepter inside Strucker's laboratory.

Return to Base
Rogers, Tony Stark and Thor discuss victory
With the mission a success and HYDRA officially defeated, Rogers with the other Avengers flew back on the Quinjet, with Rogers still checking in while Clint Barton and Bruce Banner recovered from their experiences during the battle. Along the way, Rogers and his own allies had observed the Scepter and commented on their victory over HYDRA.

Rogers agrees to party with the Avengers
Pleased to have finally ended their search for Loki's Scepter while also having a major victory over HYDRA, Tony Stark then requested to Thor that he be allowed to keep the Scepter under observation for a few days to study it before it was returned to Asgard, also noting they should have a party to celebrate their victory. Thor then agreed to keep the Scepter on Earth, and Rogers also agreed that a party to celebrate the successful defeat of HYDRA was a good idea.

Captain America is debriefed by Maria Hill
Once they had arrived back at the Avengers Tower, the team was greeted by Maria Hill. While Helen Cho took Barton away to receive treatment following his injury, Hill briefed Rogers on the twins they had all encountered, who had been identified as Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. She explained their poverty while living in Sokovia and how they lost their parents, which had led to them both volunteering for Baron Wolfgang von Strucker's enhancement experiments.

Rogers discusses Wanda and Pietro Maximoff
When Hill called the Maximoff's decision to be experimented on by Strucker insane, Rogers expressed his understanding of the twins' decision, comparing his own decision to allow a German scientist to experiment on him, referring to Abraham Erskine's Project Rebirth. When Hill noted that they were not fighting in World War II like he was in the 1940s, Rogers argued that from the Maximoff's point of view, they were still in their own war before heading downstairs.

Victory Celebration
Rogers speaking with Sam Wilson at the party
Rogers joined the Avengers, plus Sam Wilson and James Rhodes, at a party in Avengers Tower to celebrate their victory over HYDRA. Rogers and Wilson discussed working together and their continued search for Bucky Barnes. When Rogers suggested Wilson could join the Avengers, Wilson claimed not to be interested in joining. They went on to discuss Rogers finding himself a house in Brooklyn.

Rogers sharing an Asgardian drink with Thor
Later, Rogers and Thor drank thousand-year-old alcohol from Asgard with a group of World War II veterans. Although Thor deemed only himself and the Super-Soldier Rogers to be strong enough to drink the powerful alcohol, one of the Veterans insisted upon having a drink of the Asgardian alcohol. Thor relented with Rogers' nod of approval which resulted in the man having to be carried away from Avengers Tower for instantaneously becoming too drunk.

Rogers has a conversation with Bruce Banner
While the party had still continued, Rogers went to the bar and came across Bruce Banner speaking to Natasha Romanoff, with Romanoff clearly flirting with the nervous Banner. When Romanoff left, Rogers spoke to Banner, telling him that Romanoff was clearly attracted to him and noting how Romanoff was usually much more closed off but seemed highly relaxed around him, although Banner had still insisted that Romanoff was merely enjoying have a flirt with him.

Rogers and Banner discussing Romanoff
Rogers insisted that as he knew what it was like to leave a love too long, and therefore Banner should not let the chance for a happy life go past, noting that he had been flirted with by Romanoff in the past while they worked as S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and the way she spoke to Banner was more than mere flirting. As Rogers walked away, Banner pondered this before questioning exactly what Rogers meant when he had claimed that Romanoff had flirted with him in the past.

Rogers and Thor listen to Tony Stark boasting
Once most of the guests had finally returned home from the party, the group, joined by Helen Cho, took turns attempting to lift Mjølnir. Leading the attempts was Clint Barton who was the first to try and when he failed, both Tony Stark and James Rhodes tried using Iron Man Gauntlets but still failed to even make the hammer move an inch, much to the great amusement of Thor who continued pushing the other Avengers to try out their luck during their game.

Rogers makes his own attempt to lift Mjølnir
When Rogers finally stepped up and attempted to lift Mjølnir, he was able to briefly nudge the hammer, much to Thor's surprise, but in the end, he was still unsuccessful. Ultimately, Stark had suggested that the hammer was actually imprinted with Thor's fingerprints and was not enchanted by Odin with Asgardian Magic as Thor claimed, but Thor simply insisted that none of them were worthy enough, causing all the others to mockingly boo him for his egotistical claims. Unknown to Thor, Rogers was actually deemed worthy of Mjølnir from that point onwards upon touching the hammer, but he secretly chose to not lift it to be polite as that would have made Thor feel "less special."

Ultron Offensive
Attack on Avengers Tower
Rogers witnesses the first arrival of Ultron
The party was interrupted when a loud noise rang through the room before broken down robot stepped forward, calling itself Ultron. The robot claimed that all the Avengers could never be worthy, as they were all killers who wanted to protect the world, but not allow it to change. Ultron then claimed to have killed someone to get to them but had refused to tell Rogers whom he had actually killed.

Rogers attempting to block Ultron's attack
Announcing that the only path to peace on Earth was the Avengers' deaths, Ultron and some hijacked Iron Legion drones attacked the group, proclaiming humanity inferior and ready for extinction. Rogers and the rest of the group engaged in a violent battle with Ultron, with Rogers kicking over the table to block an incoming drone which was flying directly for him and Maria Hill, although Rogers was still thrown across the room as the drone had crashed straight into him.

Rogers fighting one of Ultron's many Sentries
Leaping onto a flying drone's back, Rogers used his strength to pull the drones apart with his bare hands before he could shoot at Bruce Banner and Natasha Romanoff. During the clash, Rogers was thrown across the room and smashed into walls until he was thrown to the ground. Seeing another drone about to shoot Helen Cho, Rogers had immediately ran straight to Cho's aid and then proceeded to throw the drone back towards Thor who smashed it apart.

Rogers watches Thor destroy Ultron's body
With one of the final drones being dispatched by Tony Stark, Rogers was then thrown his shield by Clint Barton and destroyed the final drone with it. With the Avengers coming out victorious, Ultron then continued to rant about his desire to destroy the Avengers to bring peace to the entire planet, before his first robotic form was then completely destroyed by Mjølnir. However, Ultron's mind had still managed to escape by accessing through the internet.

Avengers Argument
Rogers and the Avengers discussing Ultron
As the team regrouped following the Attack on Avengers Tower, they discussed what had occurred, as Bruce Banner explained that Ultron had cleared out their computer files before escaping through the internet. When James Rhodes discussed the fear of Ultron getting into the nuclear codes, it was mentioned that Ultron had claimed to have killed somebody, although they still did not know who.

Rogers learns Ultron has killed J.A.R.V.I.S.
However, Tony Stark revealed that J.A.R.V.I.S. was the one that Ultron killed, as Rogers noted that J.A.R.V.I.S. was Ultron first threat to be destroyed. Stark admitted his own involvement in Ultron's creation; although he still strongly defended the idea as he had believed it was a beneficial plan to save the entire world. Thor, furious at all Stark's recklessness which caused Loki's Scepter to be lost, stepped in and grabbed Stark by the throat until Rogers had calmed him down.

Rogers insists the Avengers remain together
Thor had confirmed that he had lost track of the Drone and Scepter's location before Helen Cho questioned by Ultron was trying to kill him as Rogers watch Stark trying to defend his actions, with Rogers then comparing Stark's actions with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s. Stark explained there was a war coming, and not just the one against Ultron but another one coming that they were not ready for, but Rogers had insisted that they would fight and die together as a team regardless. 

Rogers and Maria Hill discuss finding Ultron
As the hunt for Ultron continued, Rogers spoke to Maria Hill shortly afterward and was told that Ultron's attempts to launch the nuclear missiles had been stopped by a mysterious ally. Rogers was also informed about the survivors of Ultron's attacks were suffering from visions from their past and had claimed to have also encountered something faster than they could see, realizing that Ultron had allied himself with Wanda and Pietro Maximoff to build up his strength.

Rogers discusses Baron Strucker's murder
The team had later learned that Ultron had sent a message directly to them by brutally murdering Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, the former leader of HYDRA while he was still locked inside of his prison cell, leaving the word "PEACE" written with Strucker's blood on the walls. Rogers collected Clint Barton to hear the new update while Barton had claimed to have been talking to his girlfriend on the phone before coming to join the rest of the Avengers in their discussion.

Rogers learns Ultron wants to steal vibranium
The Avengers soon learned that Ultron had wiped out their computer files on Baron Strucker to ensure that they had no leads on where to track him next. Together, they then went through all of their former paperwork from S.H.I.E.L.D. and had eventually discovered that Ultron would likely be going after the vibranium which he would get from Ulysses Klaue, who was in Johannesburg, who Stark previously had met, as the Avengers then departed to find Ultron.

Battle at the Salvage Yard
Rogers tries to reason with the Maximoff twins
The Avengers traveled to Ulysses Klaue's location where they had soon found Ultron along with Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, the two powered twins who had attacked the team earlier. The Avengers learned that Ultron had already purchased all of the now injured Klaue's vibranium. Rogers attempted to gain the Maximoff's trust but they seemed to have no interest in siding with the Avengers and Ultron had mocked Rogers by calling him God's righteous man.

Rogers struggles with fighting Pietro Maximoff
When Thor's peace negotiations quickly failed, the team engaged in a fierce fight with Ultron, the Maximoff twins, and Klaue's soldiers. While Iron Man and Ultron fought over the skyline, Captain America and Thor teamed up to destroy many of the Ultron Sentries while they were assisted by Black Widow and Hawkeye who then fought against Klaue's soldiers. The Maximoffs proved fierce opponents as they were both able to knock Rogers to the ground separately.

Captain America fights against Ultron Sentries
Despite the numbers being against them, Captain America were able to gain the advantage over their foes, while Thor had used Mjølnir to trick Quicksilver into attempting to grab ahold of it, causing him to be thrown across the Salvage Yard as he was unworthy to lift it. Captain America and Thor had then teamed up to destroy the last few Ultron Sentries, with Captain America trapping one during the fight before Thor smashed off it's head with a powerful strike from Mjølnir.

Rogers manages to subdue Pietro Maximoff
Eventually, while Iron Man still continued fighting Ultron in the skies above Johannesburg, Captain America used his shield to known out several more of the remaining Klaue soldiers before he was then able to knock Pietro Maximoff to the ground with another strong hit from his shield, ordering him to stay down. While the Avengers were still fighting against their enemies, however, the vibranium was still stolen by another of Ultron's Sentries who managed to escape.

Seeing Visions
Captain America is attacked by Wanda Maximoff
However, just as their Battle at the Salvage Yard was coming to its end, Captain America took a hit by Pietro Maximoff who charged straight into Rogers at full speed which then knocked him back. While Rogers recovered from the strike, Wanda Maximoff had taken advantage of him before injured and then proceeded to use her powers to affect Rogers' mind and make him see strange visions.

Rogers sees a vision caused by Wanda Maximoff
No longer seeing himself in the Salvage Yard fighting alongside his allies, Rogers then saw strange images of the life he almost could have had with both his former comrades celebrating their own final victory, and Agent Peggy Carter following the final ending of World War II, if he had not been frozen within ice for almost seventy years following his final battle against Red Skull, resulting in him becoming trapped in this new world he had never fully adjusted to.

Rogers stands alone inside his own sad vision
Rogers saw himself in a ballroom in the 1940s when Agent Carter approached him and told him he could finally stop fighting. When he turned around, however, everyone had vanished and Rogers stood alone. The tactic was used in an attempt to break Rogers' heart when confronted by his tragic situation. Meanwhile, Thor and Black Widow were also given similar visions until Hawkeye had subdued Scarlet Witch and forced her and Quicksilver to escape.

Rogers recovering from his own tragic vision
With most of the Avengers suffered from these strange and painful visions, and Iron Man fought the deranged Hulk in Johannesburg, the team decided to escape. While still on board the Quinjet, they were updated by Maria Hill on the public's perception of the Avengers in the wake of Hulk's destructive rampage. As Rogers, Romanoff and Thor tried to cope with what they had seen, Barton made the call for them to hide out at his homestead where they could rest up.

Escape to the Retreat
Rogers discovers Clint Barton has a family
When the team had arrived at Clint Barton's Homestead where they intended to recover from their ordeals, they discovered, much to their great surprise that Clint Barton was in fact married with two children and one more on the way. While Rogers apologized to coming to their home unexpectedly, Barton had explained that the reason the team had been unaware of his family was due to Director Nick Fury helping him to have this second peaceful life outside of S.H.I.E.L.D. where his family could be safe from any of Barton's enemies.

Rogers considers what he saw in his vision
Once introductions had been made, Thor informed the team that he intended to try and learn more about the vision he had been given which had showed him the possible Destruction of Asgard as well as images of the Infinity Stones. While Rogers had stepped out with him, Thor then immediately left the farm to look for the answers he needed, while Rogers stood outside of the doorway, haunted by the idea of a peaceful life with a family which he could never have.

Rogers attempting to relax with Tony Stark
Attempting to relax, Rogers and Tony Stark went outside together and chopped wood. They discussed how Wanda Maximoff had been able to use her powers to pull their team apart with ease, although Stark questioned why Rogers had seemed less affected. When the conversation moved onto how Stark and Bruce Banner inadvertently creating Ultron, they began to argue and debate whether or not Stark should have experimented on the Scepter, causing the disaster.

Rogers argues with Tony Stark on his actions
Stark argued that he and Banner were doing research into Ultron with the intention of ending the need for the Avengers, still insisting that the Ultron Program was originally designed to protect the Earth. As the argument became more intense, Rogers ripped a log in half with his bare hands before Rogers then told Stark that trying to end wars before they start results in the deaths of innocent people. They were then interrupted by Laura Barton who asked for Stark's help.

Nick Fury's Return
Rogers listens to Nick Fury giving his speech
The team was later joined by Nick Fury who had come there in order to motivate the Avengers them restart their fight. Fury then explained that Ultron had pulled the team apart in order to buy himself time, noting that the amount of vibranium he had taken from Ulysses Klaue was unlikely to be used for one thing. As Rogers questioned where Ultron was, Fury noted that Ultron's attempts to get nuclear launch codes being stopped by an unknown enemy of Ultron.

Rogers considering Ultron's next actions
Motivating the team, Fury noted that without S.H.I.E.L.D. to support them, they now only had their wit and their will to save the world but must stand and fight, and when Fury insulted Ultron, calling him a Platinum Bastard, Natasha Romanoff teased Rogers by joking about his dislike for bad language. Bruce Banner worked out that Ultron's plan would be to create another body made of synthetic tissue using the Regeneration Cradle, and would likely do this with Helen Cho's assistance.

Captain America saying goodbye to Nick Fury
Rogers spoke to Tony Stark, who was planning on going straight to the NEXUS to investigate who was assisting their fight against Ultron. They discussed the being Ultron was now planning on building, with Rogers joking that he missed the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was himself with Project Rebirth. Fury then left the Homestead and also requested the help of Maria Hill from Stark, promising that he would be back to do something dramatic.

Battle of Seoul
Captain America searches for Ultron in Seoul
The team tracked down Ultron at Helen Cho's own Facility within the city of Seoul, where Ultron was still attempting to complete his plans to build himself a new body using the vibranium which he had previously taken from Ulysses Klaue. Having been dropped off from the Quinjet, Rogers ordered his teammates to stay close while he personally investigated.

Captain America finds a wounded Helen Cho
When Rogers entered the lab, he soon found Cho lying injured on the floor after being shot by Ultron. Cho then explained to him that the being inside the Regeneration Cradle had a Powerful Gem on its head, which could not be destroyed without then creating a massive explosion which could destroy all of Seoul. Cho then recommended that they recover the body and bring it to Tony Stark, so Captain America then went to find and capture the being before Ultron could then escape.

Captain America challenges Ultron to a fight
Having warned all of the Avengers of this potential danger, Captain America was informed by Hawkeye of Ultron's current location with the Cradle beside him. As Ultron attempted to escape in the truck, Captain America engaged him and they began an intense battle in with Ultron fired his concussion beams at Rogers and had demanded that he leave him alone, although Rogers still managed to remain on top of the truck despite all of Ultron's best efforts.

Captain America fights against Ultron
Ultron then flew up and personally confronted Captain America while insisting that the being in the Cradle could create real change which was the Avengers' nightmare. Noting that Ultron's concept was not exactly a comfort for him, Captain America then engaged him and repeatedly threw his shield at Ultron, even managing to embed it in Ultron's chest, but the robot was able to knock it away and shot at Rogers once again, almost knocking him off the truck.

Captain America is assisted by Black Widow
As Ultron gained the upper hand in their fight due to the robot's own immense strength and durability, he soon began to strangle Captain America until Natasha Romanoff caught up with them while on her Motorbike and threw Rogers his shield back which he used to knock Ultron's hand back before continuing to battle the robot. To assist him in the battle, the Quinjet being flown by Hawkeye had fired down a hail of bullets upon Ultron in order to briefly distract him.

Rogers and Ultron are thrown onto a train
As they continued their clash on top of the moving truck, Ultron sent several of his Sentries after Hawkeye while trying to destroy Captain America. Eventually, both Rogers and Ultron were thrown onto a train and continued their fight, with Black Widow asking Rogers to keep Ultron distracted. However, Rogers was helped by Pietro and Wanda Maximoff who had betrayed Ultron after learning Ultron's schemes to eradicate all human life and could no longer be a part it.

Rogers stops a train from crashing into Seoul
Seeing that he was outnumbered by both Captain America and the Maximoffs, who knocked Ultron off Rogers and trapped him with steel beams, Ultron responded by destroying the controls of the train and escaped before they could stop him. Upon seeing this, Captain America ordered the Maximoffs to assist him in finding a way to stop the train; he then sent Quicksilver to move all of the people out of the way while Wanda Maximoff used her powers to stop the train.

Captain America blocking the incoming debris
Standing in the front of the train, Rogers had watched as Quicksilver saved several lives while Maximoff used her powers to trap the train's wheels. Although he had to use his shield to deflect some debris, eventually, the train was stopped. By the end of the battle and have saved hundreds of lives from the train crash, the Avengers took control of the Regeneration Cradle with the being still inside it, but Romanoff was taken prisoner by Ultron during the chaos of the battle.

Captain America confronts the Maximoff twins
Although he was still somewhat wary of the pair considering their history with HYDRA's leader Baron Wolfgang von Strucker before joining Ultron, Rogers still recruited the Maximoffs as new temporary members of the Avengers, seeing their willingness to stop Ultron's plans. First, however, Rogers had confronted the Maximoff twins about their own recent actions while working alongside Ultron and nearly killing the Avengers on several different occasions.

Rogers and Wanda Maximoff discuss Tony Stark
Before they left, Rogers spoke to Maximoff, who expressed her fears of Tony Stark getting possession of Ultron's new body, as she began making the comparisons between the warmongering A.I. and Stark as they both intended to save the world but could not see that they were destroying it. Despite not believing that Stark was a man capable of any of the same kind of actions that Maximoff was suggesting, her words did still make him consider the risks.

Birth of Vision
Rogers and the Maximoffs confront Tony Stark
Once they had returned inside the Avengers Tower, the team began searching for Natasha Romanoff and discovered that Tony Stark and Bruce Banner were currently attempting to transfer J.A.R.V.I.S.' consciousness into the being Ultron had created inside the Regeneration Cradle. When Rogers saw this, he and the Maximoff twins confronted them, mortified that Stark would risk creating yet another Ultron.

Rogers engages in a fight against Iron Man
Although Rogers remanded that they shut down the machine, Stark refused and Banner questioned if Wanda Maximoff was now controlling Rogers' actions. Although Quicksilver attempted to unplug all the machinery, he was soon subdued by Clint Barton. As tensions had continued to rise, they engaged in a short fight. However, their fight was quickly interrupted when Thor arrived and used his lightning to activate the Regeneration Cradle and give new life to the being inside. 

Rogers witnesses the birth of Vision
The being launched out of the Cradle as the Avengers watched with confusion before it briefly attacked the team, causing Thor to throw it across the room. The being stopped mid-flight when it started out of the window at New York City and seemingly calmed down, with Thor recommending that Captain America not engage with it. The being, dubbed Vision, apologized for its mistake and gave itself a uniform and cape which was based on Thor's uniform.
