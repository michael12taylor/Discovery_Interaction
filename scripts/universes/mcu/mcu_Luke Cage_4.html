<html><p>They used the opportunity of being alone to look at the unlocked files from Reva Connors, with Cage noting this might be their only chance to get into the hard drive. Knowing that Connors had a lot of secrets, Cage searched the files under his name. Opening the files, they found video logs of Connors detailing on Carl Lucas and his own progress, noting that his friendship with Squabbles was something they could exploit, which Albert Rackham had done before having Squabbles killed by Shades and Comanche. The truth was clear. Connors had been part of the experiment all along and that she used him. Cage took the revelation about his late wife's allegiance hard.

Cage demands the truth from Noah Burstein
By then Burstein had returned and voiced that he should not have seen that. While Cage was furious at having been lied to, Burstein tried to explain that the whole point of Connors' therapy session was to separate trash from the triumphant, in order to find the one subject that was capable of surviving the experiment. Burstein revealed that Connors lied to everybody, claiming that this was her job she was hired to do, to manipulate Carl Lucas to become the success that they had needed, telling Cage that he was the future and comparing him to a walking version of the fountain of youth.

Cage destroys Noah Burstein's laboratory
Unable to handle his fury any longer, Cage became enraged when Burstein continued to call him Carl Lucas and proceeded to destroy Burstein's lab, grabbing his computer and smashing it against a wall before grabbing some farming equipment and destroying the walls of his laboratory. Once he had calmed down a bit, Cage then warned Burstein to never do the same procedure on people again and left the barn, followed closely by Temple who had now refused to accept Burstein's offer to work with him and had taken Connors' hard-drive with her as she had then quickly caught up with Cage.

Cage discusses what he will now do next
While overlooking Seagate Prison, Cage and Temple discussed the love he had felt for Connors, which he felt betrayed by having now learned that she was lying to him. Cage claimed that the idea of Connors, whom had kept him sane while in prison, was what he had fallen in love with, rather than the person herself. They discussed if Cage should give up, which Temple claimed he should not as they had come too far, as they agreed to go after Diamondback and figure out his hatred for Cage. They decided to go to Savannah to learn why Willis Stryker hated him, with Cage agreeing to drive.

Revisiting the Past
Cage returns to his father's old church
Reaching Savannah, they stopped at Baptist Church which Cage told Claire Temple had once belonged to his father, pointing towards a sign that had originally been made by his own grandfather after World War II. As they moved inside the church, Temple asked what happened and why there seemed to be nobody left inside the church, to which Cage claimed he did not know as they stepped inside to take a better look, finding that the church was now abandoned and covered on the inside with graffiti.

Cage remembers his life as young Carl Lucas
As he overlooked the damaged church, Cage recalled his years as a child where he had been overhearing several conversations with his own father and mother about caring for his son, which in turn helped him to recall encountering Dana Stryker leaving his father's office during their affair. Thinking over everything that he had encountered when he was a child growing up inside that church, Cage came to the realization that what Willis Stryker had said to him was in fact the truth, recalling his mother threatening to stop funding all of Willis' education at Lieber Academy if Dana did not stay silent.

Cage accepts the truth about Willis Stryker
Being dragged back to reality by Temple, Cage finally admitted that it was true that Diamondback was his own brother, noting that nobody had ever told him this during his youth. Cage told Temple how when he had born, he had been regarded as the miracle baby, despite Stryker having been born first. Cage noted that Diamondback started this by sending Cage to Seagate Prison, noting that if that had not happened then he would never have gotten his powers and Reva Connors would still be alive. Cage then vowed to return to Harlem and also stop all of Diamondback's plans himself.

Attack on Harlem's Paradise
Cage is given a warning from Dave Griffith
Finally returning back to Harlem, Cage learned from Dave Griffith that he was a public enemy having been blamed for attacking the New York City Police Department while he had been on the run, although Griffith promised to stay quiet about having seen him. He learned from Griffith there was a gathering in Harlem's Paradise where people against his actions were getting together, so Cage and Temple went in to try and get a look first hand at what was happening.

Cage spots Diamondback in the building
Keeping distance from the crowd as Mariah Dillard gave a speech condemning Cage's actions and blaming him for the recent chaos, Cage soon spotted Diamondback overlooking the entire room during Dillard and Reverend John Pope's speeches condemning the actions of Cage, with Dillard comparing him to Jessica Jones and her fight against Kilgrave which she doubted. While Cage looked over the room, he spotted Misty Knight was heading toward Diamondback and noticed that she had been spotted doing so. Knowing that she needed back up, Cage told Temple to stay where she was. 

Cage saves Misty Knight from the gunfire
Heading upstairs to Cottonmouth's former office, Cage managed to get there in time before she got killed by Diamondback, who had drawn his guns and fired upon Knight, causing chaos to erupt in the building. Charging into the room, Cage protected Knight from Diamondback's bullets with his own body. Knowing that he can't be sure if Diamondback got more of the Judas Bullets which could still kill him, Cage retreated with Knight in his arms. As all the crowds dispersed, Cage took cover under the bar and protected Knight from getting shot as more of Diamondback's crew fired at them.

Cage hides Misty Knight inside the kitchen
Knight urged Cage to rush to the exit, but he told her that he couldn't cover her from every angle. Looking out over the chaos, Cage saw Damon Boone hiding from all the bullets before he spotted Claire Temple, he motioned her to get out of the club while she pointed out an exit for them. When Cage shows an opening, he lifted Knight and headed toward the kitchen as Zip and the other goons continued shooting him. Once in the kitchen, Cage set down Knight before he immediately barricaded the door by pushing a large fridge in it's path which could not be moved by any of Diamondback's men.

Cage tells Misty Knight about Willis Stryker
Checking on Knight's wound, Cage noticed that she was bleeding fast as Diamondback seemed to have shot an artery, so he was forced to push Knight's own finger into the wound in an attempt to lose down the bleeding. Knowing that they could not stay there for much longer as the door would soon be destroyed, Cage took Knight down a hidden basement in the kitchen, while she questioned who Willis Stryker was as Cage admitted he was his half brother. They reached the basement in time before Diamondback blew the kitchen with the help of Shades, before they entered and failed to them.

Cage cares for all Misty Knight's wounds
While bandaging Knight's wounds as best he could, Cage watched as Knight called up Priscilla Ridley as the New York City Police Department were now outside, although she soon lost signal before she could explain the situation. Knight told Cage to get out while he still could, but he refused to leave her as she was bleeding out. Fearful of what was coming, Knight expressed her fear of bleeding out on the floor like Rafael Scarfe had done when he had been shot by Cottonmouth, but Cage calmly promised Knight that he would not allow that to happen while she was still under his watch.

Going After Diamondback
Cage listens to Claire Temple's knocking
As Cage gave Misty Knight some water, they discussed what Willis Stryker wanted, with Cage explaining that Stryker was the one who had sent him to Seagate Prison and had likely also set him up for the murder of Cottonmouth as well, with Knight noting he was likely organizing this entire situation just to blame Cage for it. While they discussed what to do next as Knight called him a hero, Cage heard faint tapping from the walls. Smashing a hole through the wall with his fist, Cage found Temple was still in Harlem's Paradise, jokingly noting that she still never did as Cage told her to do.

Cage decides to go confront Diamondback
While Temple went to get some things to help stabilizing Knight's wounds as she insulted the poor work Cage had done, Diamondback made an announcement to Cage through the speaker. He warned Cage that if he did not surrender himself with Knight, he was willing kill a hostage every ten minutes, promising to start with Damon Boone. Knowing that Diamondback was not bluffing, Cage intended to go after him, although Knight suggested that he did not have to go and fight as Harlem's Paradise was currently surrounded by the New York City Police Department. Cage, however, still left as he then told Temple to lay low and that he would come back for them.

Cage listens to all Diamondback's taunts
As Cage prepared to leave, Temple noted that Candace Miller had been hired by Mariah Dillard to frame him for Cottonmouth's death. Cage then headed to find Diamondback, he was taunted by him from the speakers. Along the way, Cage fought against Diamondback's goons while he listened as Diamondback continued talking on the speakers and told his story about his imprisonment for stealing a car while Cage had been freed by their father and joined the United States Marine Corps. Diamondback explained how he had been sent for hard time upon killing another prisoner out of self defense.

Cage learns Damon Boone has been killed
Cage was forced to listen as Diamondback went on to explain how his mother died alone from cancer while Stryker was imprisoned, something he still blamed Cage for. While Cage easily subdued men who tried to use martial arts against him while still making his way up the stairs ready to confront his brother, he listened as Diamondback armed himself with the Judas Gauntlet and proceeded to kill Boone with him, causing damage to Boone's body which he could easily blame Cage for. While Diamondback had ordered Shades to remove Boone's corpse, Cage then furiously punched a wall.

Arrested by Misunderstanding
Cage frees all of Diamondback's hostages
Having cut the power across the building, Cage managed to reach the main hall where he proceeded to knock out Sugar with a swat to the head before he got the crowd of people out. Except Candace Miller who was revealed to still be held hostage by Diamondback, who held her at the edge of the platform above them with a gun held to her back. Diamondback revealed himself and Miller to Cage, in his attempt to force Cage to stay behind to be captured in order to save Miller's life as he held a gun to her back.

Cage has a standoff against Diamondback
Cage tried to talk to Diamondback and convince him to let Miller go free and claiming they could have solved their problems years earlier, but Diamondback instead traded insults, claiming he wished Cage had died during childbirth. but despite Cage's attempts to talk to his brother, he was unreasonable, even when Cage mentioned his fondness for Dana Stryker, Diamondback responded by claiming that he could never stand Etta Lucas, calling her a bitch. Diamondback taunted Cage by telling him that Mariah Dillard had supplied them with Judas Bullets and were thus now lethal on him.

Cage is arrested by the incoming SWAT teams
Having the SWAT teams preparing to storm Harlem's Paradise, Diamondback gave Cage the choice to either run and allow Miller to die, or save Miller and be arrested or killed. Despite Cage still trying to reason with him, Diamondback then dropped Miller from the balcony and Cage managed to save her just in time, managing to avoid Diamondback's Judas Bullet which he fired at him. As his brother made his escape with the help of Zip, Cage was surrounded by SWAT team who proceed to arrest him, with Miller apologizing for her involvement as Cage put up his hands and was arrested.

Cage is led outside of Harlem's Paradise
With Diamondback's goons, including Shades, also being taken into custody, Cage was led out of the club by the SWAT team under the supervision of Blake Tower and Priscilla Ridley and the rest of the New York City Police Department who were still monitoring the situation. While Misty Knight was taken to Metro-General Hospital to cover, she insisted to Ridley that Cage was innocent and tried to insist that Diamondback was the guilty one. Stepping outside, Cage spotted Claire Temple watching from afar and he mouthed her to leave while he was being put into the back of the police van.

Fugitive from the Law
Before Mario Green's SWAT teams led Cage away, he was approached by Misty Knight. Outwardly, she reprimanded him, but in truth, Knight had warned Cage not to do anything reckless before she got back to the 29th Precinct Police Station. As the van drove away, Cage used an opening to break himself free of his chains and made his escape. After running for a short while, Cage reached an alley where he was held at gunpoint by John Polsky. Cage told him that he needed to go and find the man responsible for this and that he would rather die than go back to Seagate Penitentiary. The cop told him that he heard about the people calling Cage a hero and revealed that he was a frequent of Pop's Barber Shop. Choosing to believe him, the cop let Cage go and urged him to catch Diamondback, as Cage ran down the streets. 

Cage meeting Method Man during a robbery
Next morning, Cage wandered in the streets and tried to remain hidden by keeping his hoodie up. He spotted two thugs entering a shop to commit a robbery. When Cage entered the shop, he found one of the robbers pointing a gun at the shop-owner and Method Man. Cage quickly dispatched the thugs. He shared his respect with Method Man before calling Bobby Fish. Before he left the shop, he switched hoodies with Method Man.

Reunion with Bobby Fish
Cage returned back Pop's Barber Shop to meet Bobby Fish, as he asked why Cage came back. Cage told him that he had to as he needs to take down Diamondback before he hurt anybody else. Cage discussed his options with Fish. Knowing that he could not rely on tailing Mariah Dillard, with Shades in jail, Misty Knight being busy at the 29th Precinct Police Station, Cage's only option was to find Turk Barrett and get information out of him, as Fish made sure to lure Barrett out.

Confronting Turk Barrett
Cage confronting Turk Barrett in the streets
During the evening, Cage held Turk Barrett at an alley, as Cage furiously blamed him for being the cause of Pop's death. Barrett reasoned that he could not have known that Tone would have shoot up the shop. When Cage asked about Diamondback, Barrett stalled the answer. Angered, Cage one-handedly picked Barrett up and threw him at the nearby garbage, as Cage proceed to crush the garbage. Intimidated, Barrett quickly revealed that Diamondback was at a Warehouse at Harlem River. Cage left Barrett to his misery in the garbage.

Search for Diamondback
Reaching the Warehouse, Cage had found the place in a mess, as he found the evidence that there was a shootout between Diamondback and Domingo Colon. Cage found the latter dying on the floor, before Cage found that Diamondback had armed a bomb in the warehouse. Cage managed to get Colon out in time before it exploded. Before Colon died from his injuries, he told Cage that Diamondback had a new weapon that even Cage could not stop.

Cage called Misty Knight and went to meet a secluded place to inform her about what he had discovered.

Duel at Malcolm X Boulevard
Once he had exchanged information, Cage headed back to Pop's Barber Shop. Soon after, Mariah Dillard and Shades entered the shop. They told Cage that they came to offer him a truce and an alliance against Diamondback. They offered that in exchange for helping him find Diamondback, Cage would stop hunting them and, in addition, they would help exonerate him from his crimes as both Carl Lucas and Luke Cage. As Cage considered the offer, Misty Knight appeared, having been following Cage. Before the tension got violent, they were interrupted when a grenade exploded outside the shop. Diamondback entered the shop. Fully dressed in an advanced Power Armor and ready to fight Cage.

Cage is soon beaten down by Diamondback
Both brothers engaged in a fierce combat. Using his power armor, Diamondback was able to match Cage's strength as well as being protected from his attacks. Nevertheless, Cage kept countering his brother's attacks thanks to his natural enhanced strength as well as being protected by his own bulletproof skin. The battle wrecked Pop's Barber Shop further. Eventually Diamondback threw Cage through the window and took the fight on the street.

Cage gets an advantage over Diamondback
Pressing his advantage, Diamondback started landing harder hits on Cage. Their fight attracted the attention of the people of Harlem. They all gathered and encouraged Cage to win his fight. During their fight, Cage talked to Stryker and told his brother that he was done. Stryker insisted on fighting him. Cage told him that he was more like their father than he thought. Cage urged that he should try and kill him. When Stryker hesitated for a brief moment, Cage enraged him when he told him that he wasn't ready.

Cage fights Diamondback in Harlem's streets
As Diamondback kept punching him, Cage remembered Stryker's advice during their youth when Cage fought a boxing match. During the match, his elder brother urged him to keep taking blows to tire his opponent out. Following the same advice, Cage let Diamondback punching him to the point that Stryker exhausted himself as well as the energy of his power armor. Encouraged by Claire Temple and the crowd chanting Cage's name, he went forward and started landing harder and harder hits on Diamondback. Eventually, Cage then gave Diamondback a hard uppercut and hit his chin, the only unprotected area on his armor, paralyzing him. Cage emerged victorious.

During the fight, SWAT arrived and was prepared to arrest Cage before Misty Knight intervened. She then went to arrest Mariah Dillard and Diamondback. Cage reunited with Temple and went with Knight back to the precinct.

Back to Prison
An Unexpected Outcome
Cage and Claire Temple arriving at the station
Back at the precinct, Cage explained to Misty Knight about his activities against Cottonmouth. He explained his motivations and his desire to protect the people of Harlem. Once that was done, Cage was no longer a suspect. He and Claire Temple stayed in the precinct to eat take-aways. He and Temple discussed a little about Cage's future before she suggested that they go out and have 'coffee' once they were out of the precinct.

Cage getting arrested for his old prison break
Cage noticed Mariah Dillard was about to leave so he then approached her and asked her about the files, she denied any knowledge of the files and left. Knight entered and explained that Candace Miller had been killed. Without her, the case against Dillard was unwinnable. Temple blamed herself on Miller's death. As Cage went to comfort her, Marshall Franco and Marshall Johnson entered and called Cage by his real name, Carl Lucas. They have come to arrest Cage for his unlawful escape from Seagate Prison. They explained that Cage's true identity was identified by Dillard during Cage's fight against Diamondback just a few hours earlier.

Tired of running, Cage accepted and surrendered himself to the authorities. Cage apologized to Temple. They shared a kiss. Temple told Cage that she knew a lawyer and she would call him to help Cage. Once out of the building, Cage noticed Dillard talking to reporters.

Cage getting taken back into Seagate Prison
He went into the car. Marshall Johnson asked if Cage wanted to get something to drink for their long trip. Cage refused and simply urged them to get this over with. Cage told them that he wasn't planning on hibernating. He knew he was innocent and he'll see this sentence through. As they drove, they passed by Pop's Barber Shop. Cage quietly acknowledged that sometimes in order to move forward, one must go backward and face the past. Cage was incarcerated back in Seagate Prison. During his time there, he remained in contact with Temple through letters.

Back to Work
Cage is taken out of Seagate Penitentiary
Several months after returning back to Seagate Penitentiary, Cage was freed thanks to the evidence recovered by his friend Bobby Fish and the lawyer, Foggy Nelson. Eager to return home, Cage caught the nearest bus and headed back to New York City. Returning back to Harlem, Cage was greeted by his girlfriend, Claire Temple. They returned home to make up for their lost time. Temple asked what Cage wanted to do now that he was freed. Cage wanted to continue helping the people of Harlem.

Cage is finally reunited with Claire Temple

The day after the earthquake, Cage and Temple spent their time assisting their community. Cage was determined to prevent more youth from getting hurt from their nightly activities. Temple advised him to look for information at 188th Street. Cage went there and found Turk Barrett. He interrogated the man for answers and for Dillard's whereabouts. Barrett explained that Dillard and Shade has disappeared while someone named White Hat had entered the neighborhood. He was the one hiring the youth of Harlem for the night work.

Now with a name and a target, Cage began tracking White Hat. He eventually found him preparing a group of youth for their task. Cage called Knight but hanged up the call when he realized that Miller was among them. Cage followed the van, intending on stopping and saving Miller.

Cage has an argument with Danny Rand
Returning home to Claire Temple, Cage explained the situation to her as well as his injury from fighting his opponent with the glowing hand. Recognizing the description, Temple arranged for a meeting with her friend, Colleen Wing and her boyfriend Danny Rand. Their meeting at the Chikara Dojo was rocky due to what happened the night before. Cage was further skeptic about the mysticism of Rand's powers and the organisation known as the Hand. Temple pleaded for them both to work together. Initially Cage and Rand managed to find common grounds but their hostility reignited when their conversation turned to Miller. They argued which caused Cage to leave the Dojo.

Defenders United
Cage discusses about Cole to Dolores
Cage went to meet Cole Miller to ask him for information. Miller told Cage that they were cleaning bodies and that the organization was tracking their movement. When Cage asked about the Hand, Miller resignedly asked Cage to buy his mother some lottery tickets and to tell her that he was sorry. Cage went and brought the lottery ticket for Dolores. While he was inside her home, Cage went to place the tickets into a box, Cage discovered that Cole had left a roll of money from Midland Circle for his mother. Not long afterward, Dolores received a phone call that Cole died in an accident. Cage consoled the broken mother.

Cage and Dolores Miller learned of Cole Miller's death

The Defenders proceed to share information with one another and worked on dealing with the Hand.

Not long afterwards, they were interrupted by the arrival of Stick, the last member of the organization known as the Chaste. When the old man aggravated Jones, she left. Cage wasn't able to convince her to stay. Cage remained with the remaining Defenders to listen to the story of the Hand and their organization.

Cage looking out the window for The Hand
The Defenders were soon discovered by the Hand who have found their location. Their leader Alexandra Reid spoke with the Defenders and tried to convince Rand to hand himself over. When Rand refused, Reid summoned Elektra. Before a fight could start, Jones returned to reunite with the Defenders.

The Defenders ready to fight alongside Stick
As the Defenders fought against Elektra, they were soon met by more Hand reinforcement. During the battle, White Hat, better known as Sowande, personally fought against Cage. His opponent's fighting style through the use of pressure points managed to be a tough opponent to Cage. He was forced away from the battle when Sowande fought and pressed him outside of the restaurant when a truck ran into him. Cage was separated from the rest of his team.

During his separation, Cage fought another battle against Sowande and his men. Eventually Cage managed to gain the upper hand. He defeated Sowande and his men and proceed to capture the leader. Cage returned back to his team at Chikara Dojo with his prisoner.

He managed to find Temple and bring her to New York City Police Department for protection.

The Defenders, after witnessing Sowande's death
The Defenders continued with their interrogation on Sowande. Eventually during an attempt to escape with Rand at knife-point, Sowande revealed that they intended to use the Iron Fist to open a sealed door. Stick promptly killed Sowande to prevent his escape.

This news divided the team. The Defenders agreed to hold Rand away, a decision that Rand protested on. A fight ensued between Murdock and Rand. Cage tried to stop Rand to cease the fighting. The fight ended when Rand punched Cage with the Iron Fist which caused a shockwave that knocked all of them down. Jones knocked Rand unconscious.

They tied Rand to a chair and brought him further inside the building. Cage agreed to watch over Rand with Stick while Murdock and Jones began learning about the Hand's plans. Cage remained by Rand's side and continued bonding and calming the youth down.

Cage speaks to Stick about medication
Eventually Stick decided to kill Rand to prevent him from being used by the Hand. He created a poisoned smoke and tricked Cage to inhale it. Greatly weakened by the poison, Cage was helpless to prevent Stick from attempting to kill Rand. They were soon interrupted by the arrival of Elektra who began fighting Stick. By the time Cage barely got back to his feet, Elektra had killed Stick and defeated Murdock and Jones when they returned. He attempted to fight Elektra, but already severely weakened by the poison, he was defeated by Elektra and knocked unconscious.

They agreed that they needed to head back to Midland Circle and end their threat and rescue Danny Rand. 

The Defenders escaped from the precinct and began making their way to Midland Circle. They were hunted by the authorities for their actions. But by taking the metro, they dodged their pursuer and reached the location. They headed inside the parking lot where they were confronted by Madame Gao, Murakami and Bakuto. They fought against the three leaders of the Hand. They were assisted by the arrival of Colleen Wing, soon followed by Claire Temple and Misty Knight. The Hand leaders retreated.

They headed into the building and Wing revealed that she brought explosives to level the building. Cage reluctantly agreed to the plan, provided that only the Hand will get hurt by the explosives. Before heading down to the cave beneath the building, Cage promised to Wing that he will save Rand.

Cage and the Defenders are ready to fight
The team headed down to the cave using the elevator. Cage and Daredevil prepared an ambush while Jones distracted the Hand. They spring their ambushed and began their assault on their enemy.

Calm Times
Meeting with Foggy Nelson
Cage and Temple speaking with Foggy Nelson
Days after the events of the battle beneath Midland Circle. Foggy Nelson made sure that no one will be charging Cage and Claire Temple for their actions. Cage looked for Jessica Jones to talk about what happened between them and Matt Murdock's death. He told her that anyone of them could have died beneath the cave, but he was glad that she was not one of them. Cage asked her to keep in touch. Now freed from dealing with his past crimes and his life with Temple secured, Cage returned back to Harlem to continue his life.

Harlem's Celebrity
Luke Cage walking the street of Harlem
Cage spent much of his time protecting Harlem from crime. Cage enjoyed a celebrity status in his community. Many people of Harlem admired him and went to him for protection or to take a photo. D.W. sold T-shirts inspired by Cage in Pop's Barber Shop. During the time, someone has started selling drugs imprinted with Cage's name on it. This had the effect of damaging his reputation. Immediately, Cage went to shut these drug labs down but found his task to be ineffective as with every hideout he destroyed, another sprung up to replace it. Adding more to Cage's list of problems, his father, James Lucas, had come to Harlem. Cage continuously avoided his father's attempt to contact him and focused on his war against crimes by targeting the head of the drug organization.

Cage is confronted by his father
One night, while Cage headed out to patrol the streets, he encountered and learned from Sugar that Black Mariah was planning to go legit and sell her guns to one of the crime bosses in Harlem. That same night, he encountered his father on the streets. An intense argument happened between them with Cage berating his father for ignoring all of his letters during his time in prison or even visit him after the death of his mother. Lucas defended himself that he couldn't meet his son due to his emotional state at the time but he was now ready to talk to him. Cage retorted that he would start talking to him if his father brought his mother back. Cage denounced the name that his father gave him and left.

Sometime after, while Cage and Bobby Fish were in the barber shop, D.W. entered after coming back from a funeral. More people were dying from the heroin with Cage's name. Despite his friend's pleas, Cage didn't have enough leads beside the name El Tercero. With help from D.W. and Fish, they were able to deduce that their target was Arturo Rey III, whose birth name was Gomez. With this new lead, Cage headed to Harlem's Paradise.

Cage talking with Mariah Dillard
Once he arrived at the place, he went to find Dillard. Along the way, he encountered another inmate from his time back in Seagate, Comanche. After knocking his former attacker unconscious, he confronted Dillard. Before he could question his enemy, Dillard revealed that Claire Temple was in Harlem's Paradise and ordered Cage to take his girlfriend home. Unable to risk her safety, Cage complied. As they headed home, the couple had an argument. Temple was in place to take pictures of Cage's target. Cage disapproved of Temple's involvement. After some initial argument, they reconciled and headed home.

Cage talking into a camera
Next morning, Cage received a call from Sugar who informed him that Rey had a shipment coming at night. At night, Cage headed to the location and found the truck. As he entered the trailer, it was rigged with explosives that Rey activated from nearby. Cage emerged from the explosion unharmed. Rey pulled out a rifle and shot Cage with Judas Bullet. While Cage felt the bullet drilling into his skin, it turned out that his bulletproof skin has strengthened enough to resist the Judas Bullet. Unharmed, Cage quickly knocked out Rey. Turns out that D.W had followed Cage to the site through the Harlem's Hero App. Before leaving with Rey, Cage had D.W. record his declaration of  challenge to anyone in Harlem.

Cage talking to Tom Ridenhour
Cage brought Rey to 29th Precinct Police Station for custody. He then went to Harlem's Paradise to confront Mariah. He warned her if she ever said Temple's name again, he will kill her. Cage backed up his threat by declaring that no bullets can kill him and no jails can hold him.

Testing His Powers
Cage testing his powers
Back home, Cage and Claire Temple discussed his skin's new capabilities. They theorized that the acid bath back during at Noah Burstein's home must have enhanced his skin. The couple decided to spend a day testing Cage's abilities. They went to Harlem's Jet's Practice in the city. In view of the people of Harlem and the press, Cage did a series of impressive athletic achievements. Cage spent the rest of the day enjoying his accomplishments and interacting with his fans. Back home, Temple expressed her worries that something might be able to hurt Cage, but he reassured her that nothing can hurt him now.

Hunting Cockroach
Cage on the phone with Misty Knight
While at Pop's Barber Shop, Cage received a visit from his father. After another tense conversation, Lucas left after imploring his son to visit him. Soon after, Claire Temple came to the shop, as she advised Cage to go and talk to his father before it was too late; however, Cage was reluctant to the idea. Afterwards, Cage and his allies discussed their plans. With Rey in custody, Mariah Dillard only had two connections to sell her guns to, Cockroach Hamilton and Nigel Garrison. While Cage searched for information about his targets, he was called by Misty Knight, who informed him that Rey had been murdered. Arriving near the crime scene but staying away from the investigation, Cage exchanged information with Knight and learned about the location of Cockroach Hamilton.

Cage asking where Cockroach Hamilton
Following the address, Cage briefly interacted with Cockroach Hamilton's son before Drea Powell slammed the door at him. Fortunately, her neighbor told Cage where to find him. Arriving at the warehouse, Cage confronted Cockroach, but he managed to escape after blasting him with a shotgun strong enough to dislocate his shoulder. Injured, Cage hurried home where Temple helped with his injury. They then had another argument as Temple confronted Cage about his obsession to fight crimes just like Matt Murdock did and his unsolved issues with his father, resulting in Cage leaving the apartment in anger.

Cage fighting Cockroach
While walking the streets, Cage received a call from Dontrell's neighbor and was informed that he was hurting his family. Immediately, Cage headed back to the place. He broke into the apartment and savagely beat Cockroach within an inch of his life. Seeing Cockroach's family, Cage managed to regain his senses in time before he could kill him.

Cage called Temple for assistance. Despite Cage's attempt to keep this confrontation quiet, they were eventually forced to call an ambulance and the police. Knight arrived and after some debates, she allowed him to leave the scene.

Hunting the Jamaicans
Cage arguing with Claire Temple once again
Upon leaving the scene, Cage stayed at Pop's Barber Shop for the night. In the morning, after a brief talk with Bobby Fish before Claire Temple arrived to talk to Cage about what happened last night. She asked why he didn't simply knock Cockroach Hamilton unconscious instead of almost destroying his apartment during the fight. She expressed her worry about Cage's mental state, but he did not stay long to have the talk. 

Cage began searching for the last potential buyer, Nigel Garrison. His search brought him to Gwen's. When he arrived at the restaurant, he met Ingrid Mackintosh. He asked her questions about Garrison but she claimed she did not know. As Cage left the restaurant, he noticed one of the guests conspicuously leaving in a hurry. He began following the man and eventually arrived at the Jamaican gang's hideout.

In the hideout, Cage confronted Bushmaster and his gang. At first, Bushmaster offered Cage the opportunity to work together but Cage refused and demanded the Yardies to refuse Mariah Dillard's gun deal. Eventually, this led to a fight between Cage and the Yardies as Cage easily won his fight. Believing that he had intimidated the gang and his message affirmed, Cage left the hideout.

Argument with Claire
Cage and Claire arguing for a third time
Returning home, Cage found Claire Temple waiting for him. They began talking. Cage told his girlfriend that he loves her but she cannot keep him from fighting crimes and he was simply following Pop's wish for him to be a hero. Temple reasoned why preventing him from going back to Seagate Penitentiary again was a bad thing and his recent brutality brings doubt to Cage's understanding of being a hero. Temple further argued his recent actions are scaring the people of Harlem including herself. Cage, however, reasoned that he is a black man and people will always be afraid of him, as he also then retorted that Temple had never felt racism as he did. Cage further argued that his anger is real, but he is willing to use that anger and intimidation to keep people from getting hurt. Temple retorted that this wasn't the real him. Cage fired back by telling her that she could not decide what part of him that she did not like and she must accept all of him.

Temple agreed that sometimes bad people must be punished but that didn't mean that Cage has to enjoy punishing criminals. She also stated that Cage's problem was his refusal to accept responsibility and his war against crimes was simply an excuse to avoid it and running from his problems. Temple admitted she met with Cage's father, James Lucas, during the day and that he was not the enemy that Cage thought he was. Increasingly angered, Cage told her that she had no right to do it. Temple continued to urge Cage to meet with his father and that he must stop using Lucas as a fuel to his anger otherwise he will become just like the monster he thought his father was.

In a moment of rage, Cage angrily punched a hole in Temple's wall. Completely dismayed by his action and the distress it caused his girlfriend, Cage could only wordlessly apologize to Temple as she sadly informed Cage that she needed a break from their relationship. Despite Cage's plead, but his action has invoked bad childhood memories from Temple between her father and mother as Temple tearfully told Cage to leave her apartment.

Completely despondent of what has just transpired at home, Cage somberly walked the streets as he headed to Pop's Barber Shop.

Cage engaged Bushmaster in combat. Unfortunately, Bushmaster's superior fighting style and his enhanced strength and agility managed to defeat Cage and knock him unconscious before Bushmaster left him on the streets as Dave Griffith took pictures and recorded the event. After a brief moment, Cage woke up and weakly headed back to the barbershop.

Cage was informed by D.W. that he saw Temple moving things from her apartment. Heading to the apartment, he found it in the middle of moving. Cage was informed that he wasn't welcome in the apartment and received a letter from Temple before leaving.

Cage bid his friend a fond farewell. Once Fish has left the barbershop, Cage was visited by a process server of the Superior Court of New York. He had come to inform Cage that Cockroach was suing him.

Cockroach's Revenge

The next day, Cage and Foggy Nelson discussed the lawsuit with Cockroach, represented by Mariah's personal lawyer, Benjamin Donovan. During the conversation, Cockroach downplayed his crimes and exaggerated Cage's action which caused him to break the boardroom table in anger. Nelson told Cage that they couldn't go to court because they aren't in the best position in the eyes of the court given Cage's history. Nelson explained Donovan has given Cage an ultimatum of paying Cockroach 100,000 Dollars in 72 hours.

Cage began searching for a way to pay Cockroach. He refused to ask for Danny Rand's assistance given that he got himself into this problem. Cage asked for a commercial but got refused due to his defeat by Bushmaster. He was refused from joining a football team because of his powers would make it unfair. Finally, after talking to a producer from a documentary series where he has to go through a series of embarrassing fight against animals, Cage relented and decided to agree on Nelson's suggestion to meet an individual who wanted Cage to make an appearance at his party.

At night, Cage and Nelson headed to the party. To Cage's annoyance, he spent his time taking pictures with guests, accompanying Jones and standing guard for him. Eventually, Cage encountered Shades at the party. Before their conversation escalated, Cage was called to stand in the platform with Jones who wanted to have fun shooting Cage. Despite Cage's plead that the act was dangerous given that the bullet would ricochet and hit one of the guests, Jones insisted. Before he could fire, he was disarmed by another assailant. The party erupted into chaos as Cage fought the attackers. During the attack, Cage noticed Jones getting kidnapped. After he managed to rescue Jones, Cage declared that the price for his hiring just got doubled as he prepared to protect Jones from the oncoming Stylers.

Protecting Piranha Jones

Cage and Jones began rushing through the streets as they tried avoiding the Stylers hunting them. After much difficulty and fighting, Cage managed to bring Jones to an abandoned cinema to hide from the Stylers. While they were hiding, Cage began interrogating Jones for information about his importance to Dillard and Shades. During their talk, Cage learned Jones is single-handedly responsible for Dillard's wealth and thus her access to power. Knowing now how important he is, Cage decided to keep Jones under his watch. Meanwhile, D.W. called Cage to inform him that someone has entered the barbershop.
