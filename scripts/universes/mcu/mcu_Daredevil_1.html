Matthew Michael "Matt" Murdock is a lawyer who had been blinded as a young boy by a radioactive substance that fell into his eyes from a crashed vehicle, and even though he lost his sight, his other four remaining senses were heightened to superhuman levels. After his father was killed by mobsters, Murdock was trained by Stick to become a warrior, using his disability as an advantage to fight for the Chaste. However, Murdock's compassion with Elektra led him to be rejected by Stick, as he then returned to Columbia University with Foggy Nelson to gain his law degree and dedicated his life to fight injustice where he could find it in New York City as a lawyer by day with his law firm Nelson and Murdock, and by night as a vigilante known as Daredevil. Murdock's actions as a crime fighter had eventually put him into conflict with a crime lord named Wilson Fisk. Murdock used his skills to expose Fisk's criminal activities and then have him taken to prison.

Daredevil's actions in New York City and his strict moral code soon put him into conflict with the Punisher, a vigilante who believed that death was the only punishment for crime as he caused chaos across the city. While dealing with the Punisher, Daredevil was also thrown into more personal turmoil by the sudden return of Elektra as well as Stick, who had both attempted to recruit Daredevil to join into their conflict against the Hand. Murdock eventually managed to find a middle ground with the Punisher while also defeating the Hand's member Nobu Yoshioka, although losing Elektra in the process and watching Nelson and Murdock fall apart as Foggy Nelson still struggled to cope with Murdock's double life as both a lawyer and a crime-fighting vigilante.

Following the demise of Elektra and his law firm falling apart, Murdock then retired from his vigilante activities as Daredevil and attempted to live a normal life as a lawyer, while telling Karen Page his own true secret identity in the hope of repairing their relationship. However, once the Hand began their attack on New York City and successfully managed to resurrect Elektra, Murdock began investigating, becoming the lawyer of Jessica Jones in order to find out whatever she knew. Murdock and Jones had then joined forces with Luke Cage and Iron Fist to destroy the Hand, while Murdock also reclaimed his Daredevil identity. However, the conflict with the Hand claimed the life of Stick and, in a final effort to redeem Elektra, Daredevil had stayed behind with her while the Midland Circle collapsed around them.

Murdock managed to survive the building collapse and was taken to the care of Paul Lantom and Maggie Grace, although his body was broken and his mind disillusioned. During his recuperation at Saint Agnes Orphanage, Murdock had learned of Wilson Fisk being released early from prison and once again made it his mission to defeat him. This time, Murdock turned away his friends and family and also made his time as a vigilante his one and only priority, putting his life as Matt Murdock behind him. Although Fisk had thought of many of the contingencies to his plans, blackmailing Ray Nadeem and using Benjamin Poindexter to impersonate and frame the Daredevil, Murdock eventually managed to gain the upper hand over Fisk and defeated him, blackmailing Fisk with his threats to Vanessa Marianna if Fisk revealed Murdock's true identity or targeted his friends. Afterwards, he, Karen and Foggy created a new law firm to continue fighting injustice.

Biography
Early Life
Raised by Jack Murdock
Matt Murdock was born in January 1985 to Maggie Grace, a nun, and Jack Murdock, a washed-up boxer. Shortly after Matt’s birth Maggie returned to the church after being unable to properly care for Matt with her Post-Partum Depression and as a result, Matt was raised solely by his father. Jack consistently urged his young son to study hard and make something of himself, so Matt would not end up like him. When Jack returned from boxing matches, Matt would stitch his injuries. During one of these sessions, Jack allowed Matt to have a drink of scotch, to keep a steady hand. Matt stayed awake at night listening to sirens, trying to know what they were, creating stories for them.

Accidentally Blinded
Murdock at the age of nine is blinded
When he was nine years old, Murdock saved an elderly man from being hit by a RAND Oil & Chemicals truck, causing an accident. Hazardous chemicals from the flipped truck splashed on his face and came in contact with his eyes, and Murdock was blinded. The last sight he had was of his father trying to comfort him. He screamed in pain and fear when he realized he would never see again.

He woke up in the hospital where he found he could hear every sound in the nearby area, which caused him pain. His father tried desperately to comfort him. He let his son touch his face so he could recognize that it was him, which seemed to calm him down.

Murdock touches his father's face
Over the next few months, Murdock learned to read Braille and began to control his heightened senses, although he kept them a secret from everyone, even his father. His father continued to work as a boxer despite losing almost all his fights. One day, he returned home while Matt was reading in Braille with severe bruises on his face. Jack let Matt touch his face and made him promise not to be a boxer like him. One day, while Matt was reading in Fogwell's Gym, he overheard Jack being offered money to lose his upcoming fight with Carl Creel.

Murdock finds his murdered father
Matt listened to his father's fight with Creel on the television and cheered when Jack overcame the odds and won the match. He waited at home for his father's return, but became worried when he did not arrive. Matt ran to Fogwell's Gym and was stopped by a police officer. Matt managed to push his way past the officer and found his father lying on the street, having been murdered by local mobsters. Matt fell to his knees and begged his father to wake up before crying over his father's lifeless body.

Living at the Orphanage
Following the demise of his father, Murdock moved into Saint Agnes Orphanage, where he experienced terrible nightmares, causing him to wake up in his sweat screaming. To help him deal with this, Maggie Grace would sit and hold his hand until he fell back asleep. This had worked until one night, after he called for help after another nightmare, nobody came, due to Grace tending to other children. It was this event that caused Murdock to never ask for help again. At some point, Murdock held the record for the most Hail Mary's for five years in a row.

Trained by Stick
Murdock and Stick have an ice cream
While still at the orphanage, Murdock was visited by an old blind man named Stick. Stick knew about Murdock's enhanced senses and how they makes him suffer, so he took him outside for ice cream. While they sat together, Stick asked Murdock what he could understand about nearby people just from listening to them. Stick promised to train Murdock to control and master his "gift." Murdock kept the wrapper from his ice cream, planning on giving it to Stick as a present.

Murdock is trained to fight by Stick
Stick began a harsh training regime with Murdock, often pushing an emotional response from him to teach him to control his anger. Over the next few months and years, Murdock became a powerful fighter with almost complete control of his blindness. During one of their training sessions, Murdock gave Stick the wrapper from his ice cream, having made it into a bracelet. Stick crushed it in his hand and told him he could no longer train him. Stick left and Murdock would not see him again for many years.

Conversations with Paul Lantom
Murdock being greeted by Paul Lantom
One day while practicing twirling his cane, Paul Lantom approached him, commenting on his "fancy moves." Murdock asked if Sister Dora had informed Lantom of Murdock fighting again, he explained that he's supposed to be studying the Catechism for his confirmation in the Spring, and fought because he felt Sister Dora couldn't defend original sin. Lantom sat and asked Murdock how many fights he had been in that week, Murdock asked how many people complained, Lantom informed him nobody had because they embarrassed about being beaten by a blind kid. Lantom explained that Murdock being so argumentative was a sign that he's angry.

Murdock and Paul Lantom discuss fighting
Murdock tried to avoid his statement by retorting that Sister Dora should stick to teaching math. Lantom responded by telling him that arguing and denying that he's angry at others was something he would one day have to deal with, to find a way to harness it. Murdock replied that if that's God's plan for him, then maybe that's just how it's supposed happen. Lantom explained that Adam and Eve weren't puppets and neither were Human beings and God gave them free will. Murdock explained that God doesn't talk to him, despite praying all the time. Lantom asked if he was upset because he felt that he was being neglected by God. He explained that if he wanted to hear God, then he would have to listen more carefully because he speaks in whispers.

Law School
Meeting Foggy Nelson
Murdock's first encounter with Foggy Nelson
As a young adult, Murdock gained a place at Columbia University Law School. He arrived in his room and introduced himself to his new roommate, Foggy Nelson. Nelson had heard of Murdock, as he remembered what had happened to him as a child. Murdock and Nelson immediately formed a strong friendship and Nelson often joked about his blindness while Murdock would tease Nelson about many of his poor life choices, such as his decision to take a course in Punjabi simply to get close to a girl.

Escapades with Elektra
Murdock and Elektra Natchios' first meeting
Murdock and Foggy Nelson decided to sneak into the debutante's ball, through the kitchen, where they were welcomed by the disgruntled waiters. Later, Murdock decided to check out the party, where he sensed a very attractive woman. Before he could meet her, he was approached by one of the bodyguards, who discovered that he was a crasher. However, before he could kick Murdock out, the woman, Elektra Natchios, declared that he was with her.

Murdock and Elektra Natchios steal a car
During their conversation, Elektra assumed Murdock to be weak and foolish, by judging him by his wing-tipped shoes, whereas Murdock countered her assumptions by detecting that she was a bored, rich girl who wanted excitement, all by perceiving why she stopped the bodyguard from kicking him out. Impressed that Murdock was able to deduce all of this, Elektra invited him to spend more time with her, noting he was not as stupid as she had initially assumed he would be. Stepping outside the building, she then stole an expensive car before she and Murdock left the party.

Murdock and Elektra break in Fogwell's Gym
Elektra and Murdock broke into Fogwell's Gym, where Murdock complained that they would likely get arrested and he would have to pay for the damages, much to Natchios' amusement as she promised to pay the fines. As Elektra began asking questions about his past, Murdock explained, without going into detail, that he was not born blind and that his father was a boxer who had died many years earlier at the hands of Roscoe Sweeney, noting that although he did not know if Sweeney himself killed his father, he did know that Sweeney had at least given the order to kill him.

Murdock having passionate sex with Elektra
As Murdock continued to discuss his one time attempt to find and confront Sweeney, Elektra jokingly fought him to figure out that Murdock was not exactly blind. Murdock admitted that his blindness was a little more complicated than it first seemed. They had first a small fight, in which they proved themselves equally matched. As the fight continued the sexual tension between them grew until they could not help themselves and pulled off each other's clothes and made passionate love in the ring, with Murdock gently wrapping his hand around Elektra's throat much to her delight.

Confronting Roscoe Sweeney
Murdock and Elektra break into another house
As they strengthened their relationship, Elektra Natchios led Murdock to a mansion that she claimed belonged to an associate of her father. Once they arrived Elektra joked that she should let Murdock drive despite his blindness. As Elektra explained her father's associate was overseas, Murdock picked her up before realizing she did not actually have the keys and therefore, they had to break the window in order to get inside, much to their amusement as Murdock carried her inside.

Murdock and Elektra discuss their future
Once inside, Murdock lay down on the kitchen counter while Elektra cut cheese on his chest and discussed their future once they were married and had houses across the country. Murdock then asked Elektra if she really enjoyed the lifestyle of being a rich woman, to which she explained that while it was fantastic, she would happily trade it all in for a lifetime with just him and smelling his sex during sex, demonstrating this by smashing the expensive glasses which contained expensive champagne that they had poured for themselves, claiming that she did not care about this damage at all.

Murdock finally confronts Roscoe Sweeney
However, they were interrupted when Murdock heard the sound of a car pulling up outside which Elektra claimed was the owner of the house and promised to speak to him herself so he would not be mad about them breaking in. But when Murdock went to investigate, he discovered the entire trip to the house had been a setup by Elektra to make Murdock confront Roscoe Sweeney, the man responsible for his father's murder years earlier and the owner of this house, who was now pinned under Elektra's heel much to Murdock's confusion and horror as this surprise took him completely off-guard.

Murdock refuses to murder Roscoe Sweeney
Elektra explained that she had finally tracked down Sweeney in Monte Carlo where he had been living under several different aliases. Under the advice of Elektra, Murdock revealed his own identity to Sweeney and proceeded to beat him to a bloody pulp in revenge for his father's murder, but he then refused Elektra's proposal to kill Sweeney by cutting his throat. Elektra expressed her own sudden disappointment in Murdock and, while Murdock called the police to report Sweeney as a wanted felon, Elektra then vanished, leaving Murdock, and not seeing him again for ten years.

Avocados at Law
Murdock and Foggy Nelson joke at night
After a beer run, Murdock and Foggy Nelson swore to work together for many more years once they had finally graduated from Columbia University. Nelson asked about Elektra but didn't remember her name and Murdock declared that their relationship ended because "it did not work out." Nelson and Murdock then joked about their future as lawyers, with Nelson mistakenly saying they'd be "avocados" rather than saying the correct Spanish word leading Murdock to tease him, using the same word.

Murdock and Foggy Nelson discuss the future
When Murdock revealed to Nelson that he had his first alcoholic drink when he was nine, because he had to stitch his dad up after a fight, Nelson comforted him, saying that if he could see him now, his father would be proud of the man he had become while Nelson noted his whole family were coming to his graduation. They then continued to talk about their future as Murdock noted that they should call their future law firm Nelson and Murdock as it sounded better that way, joking that while he was blind his hearing was still excellent before they then got up to continue their night of drinking together and discussing a future of working together.

Landman and Zack
Murdock working for Landman and Zack
Both Murdock and Foggy Nelson were able to work as interns at the successful and powerful law firm, Landman and Zack, during which time they found themselves being forced to defend many large and highly profitable corporations, such as the Roxxon Corporation, against innocent people whose lives were being destroyed under the orders of Parish Landman who ran the company, something which had disgusted Murdock personally, as he watched while an older man who had been poisoned by Roxxon lost his case to them.

Murdock decides to quit Landman and Zack
Eventually, the pair were both offered permanent jobs inside the firm, which Nelson showed great enthusiasm about, but believing that working for such a soulless company was not the right direction for them to go in, Murdock managed to convince the skeptical Nelson not to take the job offer and instead start up their own law firm, Nelson and Murdock where they could really help innocent people and make a difference to New York City. Although he was highly unsure, Nelson eventually agreed and quit Landman and Zack with Murdock in order to pursue their dream of working together.

No Sleep for the Devil
Murdock as a vigilante for the first time
The night after he and Foggy Nelson quit Landman and Zack, Murdock would have trouble sleeping because he kept hearing his neighbor's daughter crying at night, as her father was abusing her while the neighbor's wife was asleep. Murdock contacted child services to have him arrested. However, the man was able to get away with the crime, being smart enough not to leave a mark. Seeing that the man would not face justice, Murdock donned an eyeless mask and hoodie and ambushed him at a train yard where he worked. Murdock beat him up severely and threatened that if the man ever touched his daughter again, he would know about it. Murdock then left him bloody and unconscious.

Murdock and Foggy Nelson share a drink
Murdock later joined Nelson for a drink at Josie's Bar where Nelson expressed his concern as Murdock had claimed to have tripped causing his cut on the lip. Nelson meanwhile invited Murdock to feel the drawing he had done of Nelson and Murdock's sign which would go outside of their Law Office in the future. Although Nelson made it clear that he was highly nervous about what their future held, he claimed that because he trusted in Murdock's judgement, he was with him for whatever came next and believed that they make Nelson and Murdock a success by working together.

The Masked Vigilante
Confession to Paul Lantom
Murdock speaks to Paul Lantom in confession
Years later, Murdock chose to take his vigilante career to the next level in order to protect the people of New York City. He bought a black outfit online, including a new black eyeless mask, which covered the top half of his face, and wore it when fighting crime. Later, Murdock went to confession at Clinton Church, telling stories about growing up with his father before claiming he was not there to seek forgiveness for what he had done, but was asking forgiveness for what he was about to do. Murdock refrained from telling Paul Lantom his intentions.

Rescue of Kidnapped Women
Murdock goes out as the Masked Man
The same night, Murdock tracked Turk Barrett, who was now leading a group of Russian Mafia gangsters engaged in both kidnapping and sex trafficking under the orders of Vladimir and Anatoly Ranskahov. They planned on transporting a group of young women into a shipping container and threatened to torture them if they resisted in any way. Seeing this terrible act, Murdock snuck up behind Barrett's men and attacked, knocking down many of the guards and avoiding Barrett as he attempted to shoot him, having heard the gun clicking before it was fired, before subduing Barrett by throwing a steel beam at his head, which knocked him unconscious to the ground.

Murdock rescues Turk Barrett's sex slaves
With all the gangsters now defeated, Murdock then threw a steel beam at the bribed watchman, who was just sitting and observing the fight, and knocked him into the river before focusing his efforts on the hostages. He freed the women and ordered them to head towards the city in the light and flag down the first NYPD officer they found, banging on the container door to make them leave faster. As the women ran to freedom, Murdock dodged out of the way of Barrett's gunshot before punching his face multiple times and leaving him to be found and arrested by the police when they arrived.

Renting the Law Office
Murdock getting woken up by Foggy Nelson
The very next morning, Murdock was awoken in the early hours by a phone call from Foggy Nelson who ordered him to get out of bed so they could view the new offices, ready to finally open their own law practice Nelson and Murdock, while teasing him about Murdock having possibly spent the night with a woman. Before they went, Nelson joked that he was going to bribe Brett Mahoney, much to Murdock's frustration despite Nelson claiming that he was only joking in case the NSA were listening into their conversation.

Murdock takes a tour of their new law office
Murdock and Nelson met with Susan Harris to talk about the office and teased her about which one of them would get the room with a view, with Nelson laughing when Harris awkwardly curtsied in front of Murdock which he then had to explain. Harris told Murdock that the building had been barely damaged at all during the devastating Battle of New York involving the Avengers which was why it was on the market for such a low price. Murdock made her an offer on the office which was soon accepted and he and Nelson both agreed to move in. Nelson initially protested as he felt they were not making enough profit as a law firm to even consider buying office spaces like these, although Murdock insisted it was the right move.

Defending Karen Page
Murdock and Nelson meet Karen Page
Shortly after moving into their office, Foggy Nelson received a call from Brett Mahoney, who informed him that Karen Page had been found in her apartment having seemingly murdered her colleague Daniel Fisher with a knife. Nelson and Murdock met Page and offered to represent her. When she asked how long the pair had been practicing law, Murdock told her it had been seven hours so they were actively seeking clients. Murdock listened to Page's heartbeat while she told them what had occurred; hearing that her heart rate was not changing, Murdock knew she was telling the truth.

Murdock and Foggy Nelson discuss the case
Murdock convinced Nelson that they should take on her case, and quickly told him that he believed that Page was innocent of her crime which Nelson was highly skeptical of. Murdock, however, noted that it was strange that the police were not taking her straight to trial as the evidence seemed so obvious, therefore he felt that there was something wrong with this case. Nelson proceeded to lecture Murdock about his history with beautiful and dangerous women, but had agreed to back Murdock's theory. They began work on finding who had actually committed the violent murder and if Page was being completely honest.

Murdock threatens to sue Christian Blake and Carl Hoffman
Later that night, they learned that Page was almost assassinated in her prison cell by officer Clyde Farnum, so they managed to have her freed on bail. Murdock and Nelson personally confronted Christian Blake and Carl Hoffman to ensure that Page was released from their custody, much to their annoyance. Blake eventually agreed but made a point to threaten Murdock, noting that he did not care that he was blind as if he used the same tone with him again, he would be willing to beat him senseless. Once Blake and Hoffman left, Murdock noted that this case made no logical sense.

Murdock listens to Karen Page's confession
Back in their own offices, Nelson stole some tea without any milk to make Page feel comfortable as he and Murdock began to question her about who would try to kill her and why; she eventually revealed that she had discovered an illegal money laundering scheme inside Union Allied Construction, who she had worked for, and had been found out by her boss, McClintock. As it was clear that Page should not stay in her own apartment, Murdock allowed her to stay at his apartment in order to keep her safe as she was clearly terrified for her own safety and the safety of anyone close to her.

Murdock speaks to Karen Page
Once home, Murdock explained that he would be sleeping on the couch as a large sign outside his window caused the living room to be constantly filled with light, so Page would only get a good night's sleep in his bed. Murdock then gave her new clothes, and Page briefly asked him if he had always been blind, to which he explained his story. Murdock asked her more questions about what had happened with her and Union Allied. When he asked if she still had the incriminating files she had discovered, Page lied and told him she did not. However, he could hear her heart racing and secretly realized she was lying.

Attack on Karen Page
Murdock finds Rance attacking Karen Page
During the rainy night, Karen Page snuck out of Matt Murdock's Apartment, unaware that he was still awake and had followed her to her home where she was collecting the hard-drive she had taken from Union Allied Construction. Murdock discovered Page moments before she was attacked by Rance, who slammed her head against a wall and prepared to cut her throat. Murdock engaged Rance in a fight, throwing himself and his enemy out the window.

Murdock protects Karen Page from Rance
Although Rance proved to be a highly dangerous enemy, using his knife to attempt to cut Murdock's flesh and kill him, Murdock was able to use his heightened senses to predict when the attacks were coming and fight back against Rance. Murdock eventually used his strength and determination to defeat the assassin, wrapping a chain around his neck and knocking him out with a final kick in front of the shocked Page. Murdock first promised to take the hard-drive to the New York City Police Department, but Page warned him that this would not work as the police were clearly far too corrupt.

Murdock happily agrees to hire Karen Page
Believing that Page was correct, Murdock took the assassin to the offices of the New York Bulletin along with the hard-drive in order to expose Union Allied Construction's corruption to all of New York City in one go. This caused Page to be set free and all charges against her to be dropped, for which she thanked Nelson and Murdock by cooking them a meal that was a family secret recipe. Both Foggy Nelson and Murdock then happily agreed to hire Page to work as a secretary for their new law firm as she promised she would work for free to begin with at least, which pleased them all greatly.

Meeting Claire Temple
Murdock awakes inside of a dumpster
Having trained at Fogwell's Gym for a while, Murdock put on his suit and stood on his rooftop, where he heard the cries of a kidnapped boy. However, Murdock was surprised by an ambush arranged by Russian Mafia, who had lured him into a warehouse, where they ambushed him. Despite putting up his best fight while escaping, Murdock still came out with several knife wounds and ended up falling unconscious into a dumpster, unable to move from his injuries sustained in their fight.

Murdock attempts to leave but quickly fails
Murdock remained hidden inside the dumpster, bleeding out from his wounds, until he was found by Santino, who called Claire Temple for help. Temple took Murdock upstairs into her apartment and tried to help him. Being a nurse at Metro-General Hospital, Temple quickly diagnosed all of Murdock's knife wounds and tended to them while she quickly discovered that he was blind by shining a light in his eye. Murdock woke and tried to leave, claiming the Ranskahovs would kill everyone to get to him, but Temple still insisted that he had to stay as his wounds were too severe.

Murdock is treated by Claire Temple
Before he could leave, however, Murdock collapsed on the floor and lost consciousness, recalling memories of his own father as he slept. Eventually, Murdock awoke on the sofa to find Temple watching over him, who introduced herself as the "lucky" girl who had pulled him out of the garbage. While Murdock was horrified that Temple had seen his face, she questioned how a blind man had now ended up in this condition. Noting that most people would have called the New York City Police Department upon finding him, Murdock questioned why Temple had helped him, which she did not answer.

Murdock awakes while unable to breathe
As Murdock refused to give her his name, Temple called him "Mike" before advising that he got some sleep to try and recover from his wounds. While dreaming of the night he had been blinded, Murdock suddenly awoke to find himself unable to breathe. Desperately calling on Temple for help, she discovered he had air in his chest and managed to expel it, saving Murdock's life. Temple demanded a reason to keep him there, so he explained how Veles Taxi had kidnapped a boy whom he had just failed to save, admitting he had walked into the Ranskahovs' trap, deeming himself stupid.

Murdock prepares to protect Claire Temple
After a while, Murdock smelled someone wearing strong aftershave and cologne coming up the stairs looking for him. While Murdock got a kitchen knife, Temple told him to not attack the man coming and let her talk to him, as he was not strong enough to stand straight, let alone fight. Temple answered the door while Murdock hid against the wall, and the man claimed to be a police officer looking for the suspect of a robbery, in which a masked man was responsible. Temple, however, told the man that she had not seen anything like that.

Murdock drops a fire extinguisher on Semyon
The mobster left, but Murdock heard him on the phone and knew that he had not believed her and was currently informing the Ranskahovs of where he believed the Masked Man was hiding. Seeking to stop the mobster as soon as he could to ensure Temple's safety, Murdock chased him down and used his enhanced senses to precisely drop a fire extinguisher down onto the mobster's head, knocking him out without killing him. Murdock noticed that Santino had witnessed the attack and ran away back into his own apartment. Together, both Murdock and Temple dragged the unconscious mobster up to the roof.

Questioning Semyon
Murdock waits for Semyon to wake back up
Once onto the roof, Murdock tied up Semyon for interrogation while asking Claire Temple if she had found anything on his phone. Temple explained the phone had been smashed when Semyon was hit with the extinguisher. Murdock and Temple debated why she chose to help him, with Temple explaining that she had tried to help a man in need and found a man clearly capable of much more than a normal man. Murdock quipped that his ability to take punishment without complaining was more likely due to his Catholicism.

Murdock and Temple discuss all his actions
When Murdock noted that nobody would take in somebody like him purely out of faith, Temple admitted that while working at Metro-General Hospital as a nurse, she had been hearing even more stories recently of the New York City Police Department bringing in criminals who had been stopped by a masked man, as well as a nineteen-year-old waitress who had been saved from an attempted rape. While Temple claimed to want to believe in Murdock's mission, he confessed to knowing that she was afraid. He encouraged Temple that she must not give into the fear that she was feeling or the men like Semyon and those he worked for would win against them.

Murdock begins interrogating Semyon
Murdock provided Temple with a mask and began questioning the mobster on the location of the missing boy, threatening that he would hurt him when he lied. Murdock demanded to know where Anatoly and Vladimir Ranskahov were keeping the kidnapped boy, to which Semyon claimed the boy was dead. Murdock then hit Semyon for lying but still failed to get the truth from him, with Semyon mocking Murdock for falling for his plan. Desperate to find the boy, Temple suggested that Murdock should stab Semyon just above his eye-socket, causing him incredible pain.

Murdock threatens Semyon's own life
When that still did not work, Murdock admitted that Semyon was right in that if he killed him, then another Russian thug would take his place. However, he promised that sooner or later, one of them would talk. Cutting Semyon free, Murdock then dragged him across the roof and threatened to throw him off the edge. As Murdock claimed to enjoy the fear this put in him, Semyon eventually gave in and told him exactly where the boy was: underneath the Troika Restaurant in New York City which was controlled by the Russians. Semyon claimed the Ranskahov brothers would kill Murdock as soon as he arrived at the restaurant.

Murdock walks away from Claire Temple
Sick of hearing his mockeries, Murdock still threw Semyon off the roof, letting him fall into the same dumpster he had been pulled out from earlier. When Temple asked if Semyon was alive, Murdock assured her he was, having heard his faint heartbeat. Murdock advised Temple to temporarily relocate from her apartment as when Semyon awoke, he would be back with more enemies. As Temple confirmed she had somewhere to go, Murdock requested the address in case he needed her help later on. As he prepared to leave, Temple stated she did not believe Murdock enjoyed what he did.

Rescue of the Kidnapped Boy
Murdock arrives at the Russian's hideout
Murdock then went to Troika Restaurant where the boy was being held hostage, silently getting past any guards and preparing to fight to protect the boy from any harm. He arrived and immediately began walking down the hallways and began listening closely to get a sense of where all the Veles Taxi mobsters were positioned, ensuring that he had the best tactical position to try and help the boy however he could, hearing multiple men in two different rooms who were within the hallway.

Murdock fights against the Russian mobsters
Despite all of the pain he was still in, Murdock gathered all of the strength he had left and began fighting the mobsters hired by Anatoly and Vladimir Ranskahov, while using the element of surprise to his advantage. Charging into the room, Murdock was sure to disarm the men from the guns first, forcing them to fight with their fists where Murdock was at a clear advantage, easily subduing the men during the brawl. Even when the other room came out to help in the fight, Murdock heard them coming and then threw a large safe at one man, knocking him unconscious as the fight continued in the hall.

Murdock rescues the young kidnapped boy
Despite more mobsters coming out and trying to stop his attack, Murdock continued fighting with all of his might against the criminals, determined to beat them back so that he could rescue the child Semyon had told him they were planning on selling. Murdock came out as the winner with all the mobsters lying unconscious on the floor or in too much pain to move as Murdock got to his feet and unlocked the kidnapped boy's door. Murdock then removed his mask and freed the boy, telling him that he was now safe. Murdock carried him from the restaurant and later returned him to his family.

Conversation with Father Lantom
Murdock speaking with Paul Lantom
The next morning, Murdock had visited Clinton Church and spoke to Paul Lantom. Lantom told him that he was aware he was Jack Murdock's son but assured him that through the seal of confession he could not tell anyone what they had spoken about. He asked if Murdock was there for confession, but he told him he was not. Lantom then suggested that Murdock should join him for a cup of coffee, but Murdock said they would do it another time.
