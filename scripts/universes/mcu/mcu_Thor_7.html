<html><p>Asgardian Armor
First Set: His first set of armor had a collared blue tunic with red piping and black pants. Over the blue shirt, he wore a black vest emblazoned with silver overlay. He wore a bright red cape that connected at the shoulders of his vest. His arms were covered in a form of chain-mail and he wore detailed, black, knee-high boots.
Second Set: Thor's second set of armor worn while fighting in the forest with Captain America and Iron Man. It was sleeveless with a black top covered in silver plates. It has blue pants and black boots. It had red wristbands covered with silver arm bracers. It also had a bright red cape. During Thor's stay on the Helicarrier he removed portions of his armor such as his cape, larger arm bracers and part of his chest plate, while in the more relaxed setting. While heading into the Battle of New York he re-donned his cape and heavier portions of his armor, adding to it a set of chain-mail sleeves as seen in the first set.
Third Set: The third set was a layered, collared, black vest with gold plates and blue accents worn over a chain-mail shirt. The vest continued into a loincloth which hung over chain-mail and leather pants. The sleeves ended at arm-bracers similar-looking to the vest with a red underside. He wore knee-high brown boots with gold piping. The third set also featured a bright red cape that was attached to the vest by two gold disks. During his time on Sakaar, Thor supplemented the then-damaged Third set with pieces of armor salvaged from the Sakaaran Armory, most prominently a teal pauldron on his left shoulder and a similarly-colored bracer on his right shin.
Fourth Set: Thor's fourth set of armor, donned following the escape of Asgard's destruction but before Thanos' attack, was comprised of a layered, collared black vest containing his recurring silver plates, navy blue pants, and short strapped leather gloves. After attaining Stormbreaker, Thor added his signature red cape and chain-mail sleeves in preparation to the Fourth Set for his rematch with Thanos.

Thor battles the Outriders with Stormbreaker
Stormbreaker: Thor's newly forged maul Stormbreaker is able to focus and hone Thor's powers, acting as a conduit, and is the strongest weapon in Asgard's history. The weapon, due to being made out of Uru, is nigh-indestructible and created to combat the Infinity Gauntlet and kill Thanos, it was able to withstand and overpower an energy blast powered by all six Infinity Stones and even grievously injure Thanos. The only reason it failed to kill Thanos was that Thor intentionally delayed the killing blow, a catastrophic mistake unrelated to the weapon's abilities. Stormbreaker is able to summon the Bifrost Bridge, even after the bridge's apparent destruction, shown when Thor teleported himself, Rocket Raccoon and Groot to Wakanda instantly. The weapon, like Mjølnir before it, will return to Thor's hand when he opens it and strikes his opponents with massive force.
Cybernetic Eye: On their way to Nidavellir, Rocket handed to Thor a cybernetic eye to replace the one he lost during his battle with Hela, restoring his lost sight.
Former Equipment
Thor unleashes the full power of Mjølnir
Mjølnir: Thor has been entrusted with the mighty hammer Mjølnir, that was forged from the heart of a dying star. Thor's mystical hammer Mjølnir, which resembles a mallet rather than a traditional war hammer, has a number of elemental based powers. It has been stated by Odin himself that Mjølnir's power has no equal. Mjølnir itself is extremely durable and combined with the various enchantments placed upon it by Odin, it is, for all intents and purposes, indestructible. It has deflected three blasts from the Destroyer, which was able to disintegrate anything that it hit and return the blast back into the Destroyer. Thor often uses the hammer as a physical weapon, with almost nothing being capable of withstanding a hammer blow or throw, with the exception of Captain America's Shield.
Worthiness Enchantment: After Thor disobeyed Odin and nearly caused a war between Asgard and Jotunheim, Odin banished Thor to Earth without his powers and placed an enchantment on the hammer Mjølnir. "Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor." This enchantment surrounding Mjølnir prevents it from being wielded by anyone save those who have been found worthy. When Thor sacrificed himself to protect Earth from The Destroyer he proved himself worthy to wield Mjølnir once again and gained full use of his powers. Only Thor, Odin, Vision, Hela and Captain America are known to be able to wield Mjølnir. Indeed, not even Hulk's incredible strength could lift Mjølnir, as the hammer did not deem him worthy.

Asgardian Collar: After the Battle of New York, Thor placed an Asgardian collar on Loki in order to silence him.
Gravimetric Spikes: During the Battle of Greenwich, Thor utilized Erik Selvig's devices. He used two of them to sever both of Malekith's arms. Thor then used Mjølnir to smash the last device into Malekith's chest, allowing Jane Foster to transport him back to Svartalfheim, halting his attack.
Megingjörð: Thor's magical belt. He left it on Earth, in Iron Man's possession, before departing to learn more about the Infinity Stones.
Winged Helmet: Prior to his banishment, Thor possessed a silver Asgardian war helm adorned with wings on its sides. He wore it along with his armor during his coronation as king, but the sudden appearance of Frost Giants led him to abandon it while he and Odin went to investigate the Vault.
Crown of Surtur: Following the defeat of Surtur in Muspelheim, Thor took the Crown of Surtur and brought it back to Asgard, where he intended to lock it inside Odin's Vault; however, upon arriving, Thor noticed that Odin mistakenly referred to the Crown of the Skull of Surtur, adding to his belief that Odin was really Loki in disguise. During the battle against Hela, Thor knew that Surtur would be the only one who could defeat Hela, so tasked Loki with combining the Crown with the Eternal Flame in order to allow Surtur to be reborn and finally destroy Hela once and for all.
Thor with his new helmet, mace, and shield
Thor's Arena Helmet: Acquired during the Contest of Champions, Thor donned the helmet for his fight against Grandmaster's champion to earn his freedom, but lost it during the fight.
Doug's Mace and Shield: During the Contest of Champions, Thor utilized the mace and shield that belonged to Doug his battle. During his fight with Grandmaster's champion, later revealed to be Hulk, Thor lost his weapons in their brawl, and used two retractable swords instead.
Thor arms himself with his retractable swords
Thor's Arena Swords: Having lost both his mace and shield in his fight against Hulk, Thor used two retractable swords, although they were soon destroyed by Hulk's Sakaaran War Hammer during the duel.
Sakaaran War Hammer: Thor managed to arm himself with Hulk's War Hammer during their duel on Sakaar, using it to beat down Hulk and destroy his Sakaaran Battle Axe until Hulk caught the Hammer mid-swing and disarmed Thor.
Sakaaran Laser Rifle: Thor and Loki used these rifles to fight Grandmaster's guards during their escape plot.
Gungnir: Gungnir was a powerful spear used by the rulers of Asgard and serves as a symbol of Asgardian power, prominently used by Asgardian Royal Family. When Hela came to take the throne of Asgard, Thor had taken the spear in the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf, and briefly used it in a duel before dropping it when Hela had managed to overpower him during their duel.
Advanced Tech Suit: This suit was designed in order to time travel through the Quantum Realm safely. It is a white, red and black suit that materialize around the wearer's regular clothes, managing to be summoned when time travel is required again, and disappear when no longer in use. It has size-shifting adaptability down to subatomic levels and a wrist gadget that allows for displacement through time and space.
Vehicles
Dark Elf Harrow: Following Malekith's attack on Asgard and the death of his mother, Thor, along with Loki and Jane Foster, commandeered an abandoned Harrow left by the Dark Elves. With Asgard on lockdown by order of Odin, the group used the ship to reach the city's outer limits before switching to an Asgardian Skiff.
Asgardian Skiff: Thor used an Asgardian Skiff with Loki and Fandral in order to take Jane Foster away from Asgard and find a secret passageway to Svartalfheim.
Quinjet: Thor has used the Quinjet for transportation to travel around the world and take out threats during active missions as a member of the Avengers.
Commodore: In an attempt to escape from Sakaar, Thor commandeered Grandmaster's favored spaceship. As they were being chased by Sakaaran Guards, Thor let Bruce Banner control the spaceship. He then returned and used the spacecraft to cross the Devil's Anus, which led him back to Asgard.
Statesman: Thor led the remnants of Asgard's population in the massive Statesman, hoping to bring them to Earth to establish a new Asgardian settlement. However, the ship was attacked by Thanos and the Black Order, and Thor was powerless to prevent the massacre of half its passengers and the subsequent destruction of the ship with the Power Stone. Thor, however, survived the collapse of the spaceship.
Benatar: Rescued by the Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor was brought aboard their own spaceship, although he quickly left to head for Nidavellir. Thor and the Avengers later used this ship to travel to Garden to undo the Snap and kill Thanos.
Benatar’s Space Pod: Thor, along with Rocket Raccoon and Groot, used this space capsule to go to Nidavellir in order to have a new weapon crafted by Eitri. He also used the space pod to reactivate the extinguished forges of Nidavellir.

Facilities
Royal Palace of Valaskjalf: As his home of Asgard, Thor resided in the Royal Palace, having a coronation on becoming King, protecting the palace from the Dark Elves, seize the throne from Hela. As the Ragnarök occurred, Thor decides to let the prophecy end, leading the palace to be destroyed.
