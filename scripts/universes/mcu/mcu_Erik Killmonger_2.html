Trivia
In the comics, Erik Killmonger, originally known as N'Jadaka, was a Wakandan native who was exiled after his father was forced to work for Ulysses Klaue and attempted to overthrow T'Challa from the throne upon his return.
Killmonger's scarification markings on his torso and arms resemble that of the Mursi and Surma tribes.
Killmonger is the third main antagonist to be killed by the titular character(s) of the film in which he appears, the first being Ronan the Accuser and the second Yellowjacket.
Behind the Scenes
Michael B. Jordan noted the character's dreadlocks hairstyle was a way "to stay true to the original character ['s long hair] as much as possible and make it as modern as we could."
Michael B. Jordan described Killmonger as "very strategic, thoughtful. He's very patient. Very well skilled, trained to a T. He works very hard, and he feels what he's doing is right."
Michael B. Jordan compared Killmonger and T'Challa's relationship to the X-Men characters Magneto and Professor X. He also compared his performance to Michael Fassbender's take on Magneto in the X-Men movie franchise, and to Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight.
Killmonger's armor bears a resemblance to Vegeta's costume from the Dragon Ball Z anime series, which the actor Michael B. Jordan is a fan of.
To prepare for the role of Killmonger, Michael B. Jordan wrote a diary from Killmonger's perspective.
Khalid Ghajji and Aaron Toney were stunt doubles for Michael B. Jordan in the role of Erik Killmonger.
Though rumors have persisted that Michael B. Jordan will be returning as Erik Killmonger in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, communicating with T'Challa from the Ancestral Plane, Kevin Feige has affirmed that those rumors are false.
Considering that his legal name is Erik Stevens, is possible that his mother’s maiden last name is Stevens.
Killmonger's speech on how life began in Africa is not true as life began in the oceans. However, it is likely Killmonger was referring to the fact every living human traces back to Africa at some point in their family tree.
