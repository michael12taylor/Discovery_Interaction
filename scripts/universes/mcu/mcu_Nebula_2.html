<html><p>Awakening from her memory link, a horrified Nebula stormed out of the Temple Vault and sought refuge in the Benatar's Space Pod, before rushing to warn Hawkeye and Black Widow that 2014 Thanos and his forces were aware of their plans, and that he was planning to abduct her on Morag. However, she received no response from the two Avengers and moments later, the Sanctuary II descended on Morag and tracked her shuttle. Nebula was later captured and interrogated by Thanos' forces.

Nebula being confronted by her past self
As Nebula was interrogated by her 2014 self, the younger took offense to her future self for betraying Thanos' goals. But as Nebula tries to talk sense to 2014 Gamora, she was knocked down by her younger self. Threatening her with a knife, instead of killing or torturing her future incarnation, 2014 Nebula instead removed superficial armor plating to equip to herself, and handed Thanos the Pym Particle device to transport to the future. With her outward appearance identical to her future self and equipped with the Avengers suit, 2014 Nebula activated the beacon to jump to 2023. She later succeeded in summoning the Sanctuary II to 2023 using the Quantum Tunnel.

Freed by 2014 Gamora
Nebula is approached by 2014 Gamora
Upon seeing the destruction Thanos laid down to claim the Nano Gauntlet, 2014 Gamora went to an incarcerated Nebula, asking her about their future, remembering Nebula's cryptic message to her about her fate which pertained to Thanos finding the Soul Stone on Vormir during the Infinity War. Nebula proceeded to inform Gamora that she tried to kill her and her soon-to-be friends on multiple occasions such as during the Skirmish on Knowhere, the Battle of Xandar, and the Attack on Gamora.

Nebula is freed by 2014 Gamora
Soon after, Gamora received an honest and heartfelt truth: it was her's genuine sisterly love and openness during Ego's Expansion that allowed Nebula in the future to become someone better, allowing the two to finally be like real sisters. Processing the information, 2014 Gamora extended her hand to the future Nebula, giving her confidence that they could still stop Thanos. 2023 Nebula accepted help that her younger self would reject in hubris.

Nebula shoots her 2014 self
Nebula and Gamora arrived at the scene where the 2014 Nebula was present with Clint Barton, who mistook her for the 2023 version. She held her younger self at gunpoint, defending Barton, who scurried away to observe the confrontation at a distance. As Nebula attempted to urge her younger self to lay down her arms, noting the shared memory network, past Nebula cannot fathom such a future with her present-tense mindset. 2014 Gamora stood down to show good faith and appealed to her sister, but it was all in vain as 2014 Nebula aimed to shoot at her sister. In reflex, Nebula shot her past incarnation through the cardiac region, killing her.

Battle of Earth
Nebula and Gamora join the battle
After rescuing Hawkeye and killing her past self, Nebula joined the Battle of Earth along with Gamora. At one point, Gamora saved Star-Lord from a Sakaaran soldier who ambushed him. Star-Lord, unaware that the Gamora who saved him was an alternate self from 2014, attempted to hug her, only for Gamora to knee him and warn him not to touch her. Nebula nonchalantly confirmed to 2014 Gamora that she fell in love with Star-Lord in the future, stating that it was a choice between Quill and Groot.

Nebula assists Captain Marvel in battle
When Captain Marvel arrived as backup for the Avengers who were being overhwhelmed by Thanos's forces. She was tasked with returning the stones to Luis' Van, Nebula, along with Pepper Potts, Gamora, Valkyrie, Scarlet Witch, Captain Marvel, Mantis, Shuri, and Okoye, attempted to protect the Nano Gauntlet from Thanos' forces, fighting them in the process. However, Thanos ultimately managed to prevent their efforts and destroyed the van with his Double-Edged Sword.

Nebula kneels before Stark
Through the self-sacrifice of Tony Stark, Thanos and his entire army were killed as the Avenger snapped his fingers with all six Infinity Stones attached to his armor, thus fulfilling Doctor Strange's prediction during the Battle of Titan 5 years ago in which the Avengers prevailed. As Pepper Potts grieved at the corpse of her deceased husband, every hero, including Nebula, bowed out of respect for Stark's sacrifice.

Aftermath
Team Reassembled
Nebula attending Tony Stark's funeral
In the days following the Battle of Earth, Tony Stark was given a funeral at his Stark Eco-Compound for his heroic sacrifice, which ended finally Thanos's threat. As a sign of respect, Nebula and the other Guardians of the Galaxy attended the funeral with the exception of Gamora along with the Avengers, Masters of the Mystic Arts, and other individuals associated with the Stark family.

Nebula suggests Thor and Star-Lord fight over leadership
Following the official disillusion of the Avengers, Nebula rejoined the Guardians of the Galaxy in the Benatar along with Rocket Raccoon, Drax, Mantis, Groot, and Star-Lord, who was searching for Gamora. They traveled to Tønsberg, Norway to pick up Thor, who abdicated his position as King of Asgard and made Valkyrie the ruler of the New Asgard. Joining the Guardians, Thor and Star-Lord briefly quarreled about who the leader was, prompting Nebula to suggest that the two fight for the title.

Time Heist
Memories Intertwined
Nebula battles the Korbinites

In an alternate 2014, Nebula was battling Korbinites as Thanos waged another cleansing for half of the species' population. She was bested by a stray grenade and rescued from an enemy soldier by Gamora, who extends a helping hand only to be smacked away. Perturbed by being helped, Nebula demanded an explanation, only for her to relay that Thanos has found the Power Stone on Morag.
Nebula experiences a malfunction

The two returned to one of Thanos' Q-Ships and discussed the prospect of him obtaining all six of the Infinity Stones and completing his plan. Suddenly, Thanos appeared in front of Nebula and Gamora, wiping blood off his Double-Edged Sword, and he informs them that Ronan the Accuser has located the Power Stone, and announces that he is planning to dispatch the two assassins to the Dark Aster to oversee the retrieval of the stone for him.
Nebula is observed by Gamora and Thanos
When Gamora stated that Ronan would be disturbed by their presence, Thanos warned her that his alternative was death and that Ronan's obsession clouded his judgements. Stepping ahead of Gamora, Nebula bows before Thanos promising to return with the Stone when suddenly, her Synaptic Drive glitches and a hologram of War Machine appears before the gathering. Thanos, curious, orders Nebula to be examined by Ebony Maw on his ship.

Learning About The Future

Ebony Maw examining Nebula's memory network, where he found a duplicate connection. Nebula is suspended upwards by Thanos on the Sanctuary II, with her memories being examined by Maw. As Thanos demanded him to show him her memory file, the member of the Black Order informed the incredulous Titan that her memory originated from another version of Nebula, nine years into the future – in 2023.

Nebula learning about her future betrayals
Puzzled, Thanos inquired Ebony Maw about the current location of the future Nebula, to which Maw responded that she is currently located on Morag. A curious Thanos then asked Maw to scan her memories for files that pertained to the Infinity Stones. While watching a memory that was taken during the ambush on his original self, Thanos learned that the 2023 version of Nebula joined the Avengers as he recognized a few of its key members including Tony Stark and Steve Rogers.

Nebula's memories are examined by Thanos
Proceeding with his demands, Thanos later instructed Ronan the Accuser and Korath the Pursuer to delay their search for the Power Stone as he wanted to abduct Nebula from the future. Thanos ultimately discovered that he completes the Snap in the original timeline. This accessed memory therefore struck him with the realization that the Avengers are the ones orchestrating the Time Heist with the intent of undoing the Snap.

Nebula is given a chance to prove her loyalty
After having discovered that he eventually dies at the hands of Thor four years later, Thanos acknowledged that he completed his destiny after which Gamora asked him what he did. Maw, while joyous for his master, prepares to execute Nebula for her future betrayal. Thanos, however, knew his daughter at this time is loyal to his grand plan, and spares her; he instead planned to use her for hijacking the Time Heist. Without hesitation, Thanos later instructed Maw to set a course for Morag so they could abduct the future Nebula.

Impersonating Her Future Self
Nebula confronting her future self
After Nebula was released from the examination, Thanos descended the Sanctuary II on Morag and tracked the 2023 Nebula in the Benatar, anchoring the shuttle into the ship. As Nebula was interrogating her 2023 self, she took offense to her future self for betraying Thanos' goals. But as the future Nebula tried to talk sense to Gamora, she was knocked down by her younger self. Threatening her with a knife, instead of killing or torturing her future incarnation, 2014 Nebula instead removed superficial armor plating to equip to herself, and handed Thanos the Pym Particle device to transport to the future. With her outward appearance identical to her future self and equipped with the Avengers suit, Nebula activated the beacon to jump to 2023.

Nebula is sent to 2023
But as the Avengers were reeling from the revelation that Black Widow had to sacrifice herself for the Soul Stone, Nebula had to make herself scarce under a pretext of letting them grieve. As the Avengers come to terms, Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, and Rocket Raccoon construct the Nano Gauntlet, and as they debate who should use it, Nebula activated the Quantum Tunnel to summon the Sanctuary II.

Nebula brings the Sanctuary II from 2014 to 2023
However, at this exact moment, Banner used the Nano Gauntlet to undo the Snap, therefore resurrecting every victim. Despite this, the Sanctuary II was transported to the present, and Thanos proceeded to open fire on the New Avengers Facility, destroying the vast majority of it, which also separated the Avengers from each other. Approaching Thanos, Nebula was instructed by her adopted father to find the Nano Gauntlet and bring it to him while he waited to battle the Avengers.

Killed By Her Future Self
Nebula prepares to murder Clint Barton
After the New Avengers Facility was destroyed, Nebula located a fatigued Clint Barton, who had just eluded and killed Outriders who were chasing him in the sewer systems. Barton looked up and claimed to recognize Nebula, unaware that the one he was talking to was the version from 2014. As Nebula contacted Thanos, Clint realized he was duped and attempted to fight her until she ended the transmission with her father and aimed a blaster pistol on him to silence him.

Nebula is killed by her 2023 self
Suddenly, Gamora and Nebula from 2023 arrived at the scene, holding 2014 Nebula at gunpoint, defending Barton, who scurried away to observe the confrontation at a distance. As Nebula attempted to urge her younger self to lay down her arms, noting the shared memory network, past Nebula cannot fathom such a future with her present-tense mindset. Gamora stood down to show good faith and appealed to her sister, but it was all in vain as 2014 Nebula aimed to shoot at her sister. In reflex, 2023 Nebula shot her past incarnation through the cardiac region, killing her as she shed a tear.

Personality
Like Gamora, Nebula greatly despised her father, Thanos, for torturing her and turning her into a cybernetic assassin. However, despite this, she always tried, often in vain, to prove her worth to her father. Nebula lost any desire to do this after betraying Thanos, though, and since vowed to kill her adopted father, now free to express her hatred for him. Her hatred for Thanos eclipsed any fear she had of him, as she went as far as to infiltrate the heavily guarded Sanctuary II just to try to kill Thanos. This however failed miserably and she was captured and tortured badly by Thanos. This likely compounded her hatred for him even further and Nebula later immediately became furious and brutally attacked him unhesitatingly when he coldly told her he considered killing her would have been a "waste of parts." However, like Gamora, it would appear that as Thanos was the only parental figure she knew for the majority of her life, Nebula deep down did have some sentiment towards him, as she didn't look glad when Thor decapitated Thanos and even cried a bit.

Nebula had very little loyalty to a cause as she quickly betrayed Thanos once Ronan the Accuser harnessed the power of the Power Stone, believing he could kill Thanos as he declared to do so. However, when the Battle of Xandar became too intense for her liking, she quickly abandoned Ronan to escape, despite her sister's pleas for her to help the Guardians of the Galaxy, becoming an independent criminal. Nebula is also known to be highly sadistic, even being referred to as the biggest sadist in the galaxy by Taserface and she seems to take pride in her sadistic killing of her targets, with her proudly telling Gamora that "The screams of my victims can be heard through the galaxy," which Gamora replied in stride by saying that it was because Nebula often took a long time to kill her foes because she tortured them first. Unlike her sister who seeks to atone for her past crimes, even after she had redeemed herself, Nebula shows no visible signs of regret for her own crimes and she was perfectly willing to murder anyone tasked to her and anyone who stood in her own way. However, she did say that she would help the universe by killing Thanos, indicating that after her reconciliation with Gamora, she not only saw Thanos' death as vengeance but also to save other children from suffering at his hands.

Although she and Gamora grew to genuinely care for each other and develop a strong bond, ever since Thanos considered Gamora his favored children and Gamora's repeated victories over her (which caused her to be painfully cybernetically altered), Nebula grew to resent Gamora, both for never letting her win and for being Thanos' favored daughter. However, she does still like and care for her to an extent, as Nebula said she disliked and hated her the least out of all the other children of Thanos and she did not have the heart to let her be captured by Thanos and Ronan, as she knew that one of them would torture her first before killing her, causing her to genuinely believe that when she destroyed her ship and left her to die in space that she was doing Gamora a favor. However, while she ruthlessly tried to kill her sister when they fought in Ego, even dishonorably attacking Gamora despite Gamora saving her, when Nebula finally had the chance to kill her sister, she could not bring herself to do so and although she first revealed that she finally beat Gamora, Gamora's lack of care on it and admonishing her for still continuing their rivalry caused her to reveal why she hated her and this caused them to warm up with each other. Nebula finally forgave Gamora, even joining forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy and saving her. When Nebula departed from their company, she did so on equal terms, sharing a hug with her sister before she left. Her love for Gamora was shown when Gamora was taken by Thanos; when Nebula escaped, she sent a transmission to the Guardians where to meet her and told Star-Lord not to lose Gamora again or she would sew his face to his genitals and she took time to question Thanos on her sister's whereabouts and was absolutely distraught, losing her emotional composure and almost crying, as she realized he had sacrificed Gamora. She continued to mourn her sister's death even years later and having came to regret their past enmity, referred to this with visible shame and regret to the 2014 Gamora and acknowledged her as a true sister, successfully convincing Gamora's past self to work with her against Thanos.

In addition to her sisterly bond towards Gamora having returned, in time, she came to trust and care for the Guardians, as she trusted them enough to tell them to meet her on Titan so they could fight Thanos and was visibly distraught as they ceased to exist, taking them to lay on the floor to mourn their and Gamora's demise and could not answer (only sadly looking away) when Rocket questioned on the other Guardians. She would eventually join the Guardians after they were restored. Although she didn't have much affection for Star-Lord - Gamora's boyfriend - as shown by how she threatened him a gruesome death for his inability to prevent Gamora from being taken by Thanos and later on simply said Gamora only picked him as her boyfriend as the only other choice she had was a tree, Nebula did have the heart to sympathize with him over Gamora's death, only indicating rather than actually saying outright that Gamora is dead.

For Nebula, her reconciliation with Gamora and the events of the Infinity War have been enlightening journeys for her. Having long since been driven by her jealousy and rage towards Gamora and hatred towards Thanos, overcoming those issues has allowed her to move on with her life and truly become a much better person. This was shown by how rather than continuing to work as an assassin, Nebula instead decided to work as a member of the Avengers after the Snap and likewise she would join the Guardians of the Galaxy officially after the Blip and Battle of Earth, showing that she has lost most - if not all - of the killer instinct she was once so proud of herself for and has finally began to follow in Gamora's footsteps by similarly seeking atonement and a better life. She has become much more open, bonding with Tony Stark as they fixed a ship and left Titan, with her using her technology to treat Tony's wounds before they infect, and Tony acknowledging in a message intended for Pepper Potts that she would like the "only slightly sadistic" cyborg, having performed very affectionate acts for Tony, the main ones being when she wrapped a blanket around Tony and positioned him on a chair instead of on the cold floor and also offering food to Tony, and was open to War Machine's attempts to socialize over their respective cybernetics, and rather sentimental, solemnly recounting to the past Gamora of how they grew as sisters in the future. Her growth was most shown when she confronted her past self, hoping to sway her to join their cause by telling her of what she becomes in the future, only resorting to lethal force when she felt that there was no other choice. She has even displayed a subtle lightheartedness and a knack for dark humor, engaging in macabre but playful banter with her comrades in the Guardians upon reuniting with them.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Luphomoid Physiology/Cybernetic Enhancements: Nebula possesses natural higher physical capabilities beyond any human being, which are further enhanced by her physiological enhancements.

Superhuman Strength:      Nebula forcefully strangles Gamora   Nebula has higher levels of superhuman strength, much greater than that of a human being. She managed to break through the windshield of an M-Ship and throw its pilot out of the vehicle in mid-air with ease and managed to temporarily overpower Gamora after the two of them survived an explosion. She was also able to easily snap the neck of a Chitauri soldier with one arm, even while weakened due to prolonged torture at Thanos' hands. Nebula was even able to slightly stagger Thanos with a punch and several baton strikes, although Thanos soon easily overtook and sent her flying with a punch.
Nebula forcefully strangles Gamora
Superhuman Durability: Nebula can easily withstand multiple injuries, especially impact trauma, such as falls from great heights. While her body was contorted by being blasted with Drax the Destroyer's cannon at point blank range, she was otherwise unharmed and her cybernetic implants twisted her body back into place. She managed to jump onto an M-Ship from several stories without withstanding injuries and survived to be inside an exploding ship before landing on her feet several stories down unharmed. When plugging her mechanical arm into the ship to power the ship's energy beams, she was electrocuted and experienced great pain, but otherwise survived. She even managed to survive a powerful blow from Thanos and later a shockwave from the Infinity Gauntlet.
Superhuman Speed: Due to its physiology and cybernetic advances, Nebula has speed and quick reflexes, making it useful in battle.
Superhuman Agility: Nebula has agility and coordination greater than that of a human being, allowing her to easily keep up with Gamora in a fight and dodge her sister's attacks.
Enhanced Senses: Neural circuitry located under the headplate on her face augment Nebula's vision and hearing.
Regenerative Healing Factor:     Nebula's broken body repairing itself   Nebula's extensive cybernetic implants allow her to quickly heal from otherwise near-fatal injuries, such as when her body was crushed and mangled when withstanding a direct blow from Drax's cannon. Due to her implants, she was able to reshape her body back to its original form by snapping her arms and jaw back into their normal place. Nebula was able to reshape her body after the impact of an exploding M-Ship.
Nebula's broken body repairing itself
Light Emission: Due to her extensive cybernetic visual prosthesis, Nebula is able to emit vast amounts of light energy from her eyes. This enables her to see within places of low light.
Holographic Projection: Nebula's built-in synaptic drive and bionic visual enhancements give her the capability of replaying past memories in the form of light projections. This was shown when Thanos accessed the memory file of 2023 Nebula through her past self, as the two were mentally linked through their matching cybernetic neural networks.
Concussive Energy Blast Generation: Nebula's cybernetic arm allows her to fire concussive electroshock charges from her hand towards her enemies or over a specific target area.
Nebula links her cybernetics with computers
Former Powers
Electronic Hacking: Nebula's cybernetic hand is able to be internal connected into any computer system or digital device so she is able to hack and access many electronics. This was shown as she was able to connect her cybernetics with the computer system linked with the Quantum Tunnel to transport 2014 Thanos and his army to the present.
Abilities
Master Martial Artist: As a highly trained assassin of Thanos, Nebula is accomplished in armed and unarmed combat. Nebula's skill in combat allowed her to compete with "the deadliest woman in the galaxy," Gamora, for a prolonged amount of time and even managed to defeat her when both were wounded after escaping an explosion, although it should be noted that Gamora was weakened more than Nebula was due to Nebula's more extensive cybernetics and the fact that Gamora had not been fighting to kill, but was trying to reason with Nebula; thus, she was holding back. Her most impressive display of skill was seen when she briefly fought Thanos one-on-one; although she was eventually no match for her far stronger and more experienced father, Nebula was still able to fare better than Drax the Destroyer as well as Doctor Strange, able to briefly pressure and land two blows on Thanos, whereas Drax and Strange had difficulty fighting Thanos even with a webbed cotton hampering Thanos' eyesight and could not a land single hit in said occasion, although Thanos was briefly distracted by her mentions of Gamora and soon easily knocked her aside.
Staff Mastery: Nebula is highly skilled in using sticks and staffs, her retractable electric batons being her preferred weapon. Using her staff, she was able to contend with Gamora using her sword and even managed to disarm her. Later, she was able to briefly force Thanos to the defensive and land some blows until she was defeated easily.
Expert Marksman: Nebula is proficient in sharpshooting. During the Attack on Berhert, Nebula was able to accurately shoot off Yondu Udonta's Yaka Arrow Controller before incapacitating Rocket Raccoon. She was also able to rapidly draw her blaster and fatally shoot her past self in the chest as she was aiming her own weapon at past Gamora.
Master Assassin: Ever since she was a child, Nebula has trained extensively as an assassin under Thanos. She trained with Gamora throughout her childhood, but Nebula stated that she was not as skilled as her sister. Despite that, Nebula was skilled enough that even Thanos commented Nebula almost succeeded in killing him after sneaking into his spaceship.
Gifted Intellect: Due to her synaptic drive, Nebula possesses the ability to quickly process vast amounts of information. Nebula also possesses vast knowledge on how time travel works, displayed by her notes on how changing the past does not affect one's future.
Expert Engineer: To be added
Expert Pilot: Nebula is a highly trained pilot, with Gamora acknowledging her as being better and more knowledgeable at piloting than her, capable of easily flying a Necrocraft and an M-Ship with great efficiency. During the Skirmish on Knowhere, Nebula was able to maneuver around Gamora's mining pod with ease and eventually shoot her ship down.
Equipment
Cybernetic Enhancements
In her early years under Thanos' wing, Nebula received various upgrades that allowed her to gain extensive cybernetic properties and body features.

Cybernetic Arm: Nebula possesses a cybernetic metal left arm after her escape from a Laser Thorn Energy Net within the Cloud Tombs of Praxius. The arm is capable of acting as a generator for electricity as it was used to power the broken down Ravagers ship her and Yondu Udonta were on to eliminate the multiple Sovereign ships. Her hand is designed to imitate the appearance of flesh, but it is capable of hacking into computer systems, demonstrated by a time traveled version of Nebula from 2014. However, after losing her left hand during the Battle of Xandar, Nebula replaces it with another cybernetic hand which does not imitate the appearance of flesh, nor capable of hacking into computer systems. In order to obtain the Orb, Nebula had to damage her arm in order to pull it out of the energy barrier encasing it.
Contact Whiplash: Nebula possesses a grappling hook within her left arm.
Tempersteel Claws: Nebula possessed two sets of retractable claws, one in each hand, that she can activate to grip onto surfaces to assist her when she is climbing. After losing her left arm, Nebula lost her left set of tempersteel claws.
Regeneration Implant: Nebula possesses a regeneration implant that is situated within her body. This implant allows her to rapidly heal from near-fatal injuries and wounds as well as enabling her to reshape her body back to its original form.
Cybernetic Communicator: Nebula has a cybernetic message communicator planted in her brain, which she used to alert the Sakaarans that Gamora had the Orb, and to directly confront her shortly thereafter. Nebula also used to it to alert Thanos that she was in possession of the Nano Gauntlet during the Attack on the New Avengers Facility.
Visual Prosthesis: During Nebula's upbringing with Thanos, her father had pulled her eye from her head as a consequence for losing a battle against Gamora. Thanos replaced her left eye with a bionic one, this bionic eye allows her to create projections of a specific event.
Synaptic Drive: One of Nebula’s cybernetics includes a neuro-synaptic implant located on the side of her head and also forms part of her brain. It is capable of recording memories and replaying memory files from past events. A glitch can occur if Synaptic Drives from different timelines are located in the same time, malfunctioning and granting the drives access to the records of the other.
Items
Advanced Tech Suit: This suit was designed in order to time travel through the Quantum Realm safely. It is a white, red and black suit that materialize around the wearer's regular clothes, managing to be summoned when time travel is required again, and disappear when no longer in use. It has size-shifting adaptability down to subatomic levels and a wrist gadget that allows for displacement through time and space.
Lock Pick: A small device designed to automatically open doors, stolen from Star-Lord in Morag, and used on the door to the Temple Vault storing the Orb.
Weapons
Electroshock Batons:      Nebula electrocuting Gamora   Nebula's weapons of choice are baton-like electroshock weapons which can be combined to form a longer electroshock staff that can generate powerful amounts of electrical energy. It could also be thrown and return magnetically to her cybernetic arm, demonstrated by her brief skirmish with Thanos.
Nebula electrocuting Gamora
Electric Blaster: Nebula's alternate weapon is a blaster which can fire blasts of electricity to electrocute and stun its targets, knocking them unconscious. She used it on Rocket Raccoon and Yondu Udonta to escape Berhert. This weapon, however was more than capable of being lethal, as Nebula blasted a hole into the chest of her past self, killing her.
Godslayer: During their skirmish on Ego the Living Planet, Nebula took Gamora's sword Godslayer and attempted to kill her sister with it. However, she chose not to.
Nebula's Energy Dagger: During the Kidnapping of Nebula, 2014 Nebula possessed a dagger that was able to release blue light energy and used it to remove the orange headpiece from the face of her future self.
Vehicles
Q-Ship: To be added
Dark Aster: During her time working with Ronan the Accuser, Nebula was a passenger on his ship. She and everyone else on the ship used it for transportation during Ronan's campaign for vengeance. She later abandoned the ship during the Battle of Xandar.
M-Ship: After being defeated in combat by Gamora during the Battle of Xandar, Nebula was left hanging hundreds of feet above Xandar's surface, with her hand trapped onto a spike on the outside of the Dark Aster. Gamora tried to reason with Nebula but Nebula refused and cut off her cybernetic hand. Instead of falling from the sky to her death, she landed on top of a Ravager's M-Ship. Nebula then threw the pilot out and took control of the ship before flying it far away from the battle. She would later use another M-Ship to fly to Ego to try to kill Gamora, she crashed the ship during her fight with Gamora.
Milano: Nebula was held prisoner on the Milano after being captured by the Guardians of the Galaxy before it crashed on Berhert.
Benatar: Following the Battle of Titan, Nebula and Iron Man fixed Star-Lord's ship and left the planet. It would break down after 24 days of travel, but eventually, they were rescued in deep space by Captain Marvel, who delivered them to Earth. Nebula would also ride the Benatar to take part in the Ambush on Thanos.
Benatar’s Space Pod: To be added

It would break down after 24 days of travel, but eventually, they were rescued in deep space by Captain Marvel, who delivered them to Earth. Nebula would also ride the Benatar to take part in the Ambush on Thanos.
Benatar’s Space Pod: To be added
Benatar’s Space Pod: To be added
Laser Drill: To be added
Sanctuary II: Nebula snuck aboard this ship to kill Thanos. She nearly succeeded, but failed and was captured. When Thanos captured Gamora, he brought her to Nebula to force her to reveal the location of the Soul Stone. Thanos started to torture Nebula and Gamora told Thanos where he could find the stone to stop her sister's suffering. After Thanos and Gamora left, Nebula escaped after killing a Chitauri henchman and stealing a Necrocraft.
Necrocraft: After having located the Guardians of the Galaxy on Knowhere, Nebula and Ronan the Accuser piloted a Necrocraft where Ronan went to  confront Drax the Destroyer, while Nebula boarded a Necrocraft pilot to reclaim the Orb from Gamora. After escaping captivity on the Sanctuary II, Nebula stole a Necrocraft and used it to go to Titan and crashed the ship onto Thanos in an attempt to kill him, interrupting his battle with the Avengers and Guardians, although Thanos was uninjured.

Trivia
In the comics, Nebula is a space pirate and mercenary who claims to be Thanos' granddaughter. Her appearance in the movies seems to be based more on her second incarnation from the comics.
Behind the Scenes
Gal Gadot revealed she was up for the role of Nebula.
Lupita Nyong'o was also considered for the role of Nebula.
In Guardians of the Galaxy, Karen Gillan shaved her head to play Nebula (the hair, in turn, was made into a wig, which Gillan wore in the TV show Selfie). In later appearances, her hair was only shortened, with the reminder lifted into a bun which was hidden by the prosthetics that make Nebula's facial make-up. 
Nebula's make-up, which includes a glued together five-piece prosthetic in the head and contact lenses, took approximately four hours and 15 minutes to apply and another 30 minutes to remove in Guardians of the Galaxy. By Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the applying was reduced to a two and a half hours.
Karen Gillan stated that "I think she's a really interesting character. What I like to play around with is how jealous she is. She's Gamora's sister, and there's a lot of sibling rivalry. That's the most interesting aspect to me because jealousy can consume you and turn you bitter, and ugly. And she's a total sadist, so that's fun too."
Karen Gillan also said, "She is very sadistic and evil, but I like to think for a very valid reason."
The 2014 self of Nebula was originally going to die during the Battle of Earth sequence in Avengers: Endgame upon trying to use the Infinity Gauntlet to please Thanos, but the idea was scrapped.
Monique Ganderton, Olivia Jackson, Kelly Richardson, Amy Lynn Tuttle, Shauna Galligan, Joanna Bennett, Jess Durham and Bronwyn Akhurst were stunt doubles for Karen Gillan in the role of Nebula.
Collette Von Tora, Caileigh Scott and Tracie Garrison were stand-ins for Karen Gillan in the role of Nebula.
