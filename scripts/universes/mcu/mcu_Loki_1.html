Loki Laufeyson was the biological son of Laufey, the ruler of the Frost Giants in Jotunheim, who was abandoned and left to die shortly after his birth. Found by Odin, Loki was taken to Asgard and raised by him and Frigga as an Asgardian prince, along with Thor. When Thor was to be crowned King, Loki had sabotaged the coronation by letting the Frost Giants attack Asgard, thus leading Thor to seek vengeance on Jotunheim, which resulted in Thor's banishment to Earth and Loki finding out the truth about his heritage. Frigga gave Loki the throne when Odin had fallen into the Odinsleep; however, when the Warriors Three and Sif attempted to return Thor home, Loki was forced to try to stop them. Regardless, Thor returned from his exile on Earth and ended Loki's reign. With Odin disapproving of his actions, Loki allowed himself to fall through the deep abyss of space, entering a wormhole created by the sudden termination of the Bifrost Bridge.

Transported by the wormhole to Sanctuary, Loki encountered The Other who offered to serve under Thanos' command and gave him the Scepter. Loki was given command over the Chitauri army in order to conquer Earth, under the provision that Loki acquires the Tesseract for Thanos. Once he came to Earth, Loki managed to take possession of the Tesseract and used its power to open a wormhole above New York City and caused the Chitauri Invasion, but all of Loki's schemes were ultimately defeated by the Avengers. Thor returned him to Asgard as his prisoner, where Odin condemned him to spend the rest of his life in the Asgardian Dungeons as punishment for his crimes.

However, when Frigga was killed during the Sacking of Asgard, Loki was freed by Thor in order to defeat the Dark Elves led by Malekith who desired to use the power of the Aether to transform the universe into eternal darkness. During the fight against the Dark Elves in Svartalfheim, Loki faked his death, and, unbeknownst to everyone in the Kingdom, returned to Asgard and successfully removed Odin from the throne, taking his place as King where he remained for several years. During his reign, Loki continued to rule Asgard by sending Sif on missions to Earth to investigate the attacks of Lorelei and Vin-Tak.

Eventually, the return of Thor forced Loki to reveal his deception as the pair journeyed together to find Odin, arriving just in time to witness Odin's death. The loss of Odin allowed Hela, Odin's firstborn, to return from banishment and wage war against the Nine Realms. Loki found himself stranded at Sakaar along with Thor where Loki allied himself with the Grandmaster while Thor was forced to battle against Hulk. Despite trying to manipulate his way to freedom, Loki chose to side with Thor and the Revengers in a final battle against Hela, in which Loki summoned Surtur, who defeated Hela by causing Ragnar√∂k and destroying all of Asgard.

During his final moments on Asgard, Loki took the Tesseract from Odin's Vault and in the wake of the Destruction of Asgard, chose to stay by his brother's side and support his ascension onto the throne. Consequences of his deal with Thanos would soon come back to haunt Loki, however, as the Mad Titan and his Black Order intercepted the Asgardians as they were making their way towards Earth. In the chaos that followed, Loki attempted to kill Thanos but ultimately failed. When Loki taunted Thanos by telling him that he would never be a god, the Mad Titan snapped his neck, finally killing the God of Mischief.

Biography
Early Life
Adopted by Odin
Odin transforming Loki's appearance
Loki was born on Jotunheim as the son of the Frost Giant King, Laufey. Small and weak for a Frost Giant, Loki was abandoned by his father in a temple, being left to die. In 965 A.D., not long after the war between the Giants and the Asgardians, Loki was found by King Odin. Adopting Loki and using sorcery to alter his appearance to make him appear to be an Asgardian, Odin raised Loki and his biological son, Thor, with his wife Frigga. As they grew up, Loki always felt that he was always living in Thor's shadow, envious to the fact that Thor was meant to be king instead of him.

Odin's Lessons
Loki is given a lesson by Odin
When speaking to his two sons within his Treasure Room regarding the future of the throne, Odin attempted to teach the two to value peace above war while dealing with all of their enemies. As both Thor and Loki insisted that they would both be ready to become King of Asgard, Odin noted that only one of them would be able to take the throne.

Loki and Thor are given advice from Odin
However, while Thor's eagerness to fight Frost Giants and any other beasts from across the Nine Realms grew, Loki's personal jealousy towards Thor and eagerness to win Odin's appreciation of his own merits slowly altered Loki's personality for the worse. Where he was once aloof and carefree, Loki had slowly become ambitious, going to great lengths to achieve greatness without any thought or care on the consequences for others as long as Loki himself had profited.

Talent For Mischief
Loki alongside the rest of the royal family
As Odin often spent time with Thor, Loki grew closer to Frigga and would watch her cast magic, and was impressed when she made fireworks appear from her hands. Frigga then informed him that one day he could perform magic as well, assuring him that he could do anything he wanted to. Believing that Loki might feel inadequate due to Odin and Thor's accomplishments, Frigga decided to teach Loki everything she knew about sorcery, and he eventually became an expert in Asgardian magic, gaining the ability to conjure illusions of himself and create weapons. Once, when Loki and Thor were still young, Loki took advantage of Thor's love of snakes and used his skill with illusions to become a snake. When Thor picked up the snake to admire it, Loki dispelled the illusion and stabbed Thor, who survived.

In another instance, Loki turned Thor into a frog for a brief time. After transforming Thor, Loki sat on the throne of Asgard and pretended to take over the crown. Then Frog Thor appeared and Loki was pummeled by him. On another ocassion, Loki froze Thor with the Casket of Ancient Winters.

Loki is commemorated in Norse history
Odin brought Thor and Loki on a visit to Earth, where the Asgardians taught the Norse people their language and culture and displayed their abilities. This caused the Norse people to believe the Asgardians to be deities, and bestowed upon Thor the moniker "God of Thunder" while Loki became the "God of Mischief" due to the various tricks and illusions Loki displayed, as they would then be depicted in the humans' stories and books for the centuries to come. One of Loki's antics involved him cutting off a lock of Sif's hair, which caused her to punch him in the face and kick him in the groin out of anger. Loki then chose to deal with the incident by having a bath and a glass of wine.

D.B. Cooper Hijacking
Loki hijacking a passenger plane
In November 1971, Loki lost a bet to Thor and a result, visited Earth in order to pull off a heist. Hijacking the Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305 in the United States under the pseudonym of D.B. Cooper, he informed the stewardess that he had a bomb and demanded two hundred thousand dollars in ransom. To comply with the mischievous hijacker's demands, the plane landed, exchanging the passengers on the plane for the ransom money and backup parachutes for his escape.

Loki prepares to leap out of the plane
In the air again, Loki collected the ransom money that he had demanded, and then proceeded to jump off the airplane wearing the parachute, only to be transported back to Asgard by Heimdall through the Bifrost Bridge, leaving only a few twenty dollar bills in his wake. The authorities, unaware of Loki's involvement or existence, were unable to solve the case, causing the identity of D.B. Cooper and his whereabouts to become one of Earth's many unsolved mysteries.

Trickster's Schemes
Thor's Royal Coronation
Loki and Thor awaiting the royal coronation
Loki was present when Thor was supposed to finally ascend to the throne of Asgard. Before the ceremony, Loki said that while he was sometimes envious of Thor's place as first-born, there was no doubt that he loved him dearly, while also teasing his brother over his helmet's feathered design. When Thor asked how he looked, Loki answered, like a king.

Loki attending Thor's royal coronation
However, midway through, Thor's royal ceremony was unexpectedly interrupted by the arrival of several Frost Giant soldiers who Loki had summoned earlier, who then broke into Asgard and attempted to steal the Casket of Ancient Winters in order to bring it back to their homeworld and regain their strength. Stopping the ceremony, Odin called the Destroyer, which killed the invading Frost Giants but not before they killed of the Einherjar guards during the raid.

Loki looks upon the damage left by Jotuns
Loki, Thor and Odin made their way to Odin's Vault to investigate; when they arrived, they found the bodies of the Frost Giants and the Asgardian guards who had been killed. Enraged, Thor demanded Odin march into Jotunheim and attack the Frost Giants in retaliation, but Odin refused. Thor argued that as the king of Asgard he should be able to decide these matters, but Odin told him he was not yet king. Loki stayed silent, listening and working out his own plan.

Manipulating Thor
Loki manages to trick and manipulate Thor
Disgusted at the incident, Thor unleashed his rage by throwing over a dinner table and sitting in brooding silence. Loki had soon found his brother and sat calmly next to him, comforting him over his disappointment in Odin not crowning him as the king due to the actions of the Frost Giants. Loki calmly spoke with Thor and was able to manipulate him by claiming that he also agreed with his view that they should gain revenge for the Asgardian lives lost during the attack.

Loki watches his plans successfully unfolding
Having Loki agree with his belief that Jotunheim should pay for what they had done to Asgard and their Einherjar warriors increased Thor's confidence. As Loki watched on, Thor then decided, just as Loki had planned, to disobey their father's orders and attack Jotunheim on their own so they could confront King Laufey, although Loki claimed that such a plan was madness knowing that Thor would just ignore his words. When the Warriors Three arrived with Lady Sif, Loki sat back and allowed Thor to convince them to follow him into the battle to gain answers as to why the Frost Giants had attacked, with Loki briefly claiming to be against such aggressive action.

Loki unsuccessfully tries to deceive Heimdall
Loki followed the enraged Thor, along with Lady Sif and the Warriors Three, to the Bifrost Bridge in order to travel to Jotunheim to seek answers. However, just before they left, Loki informed a guard of their intention and ordered him to inform Odin to ensure their rescue and Thor's punishment. The group went to Heimdall, keeper of the Bifrost Bridge, Loki confidently attempted to confuse Heimdall to get past him, but the gatekeeper was already aware of their intentions.

Loki being sent through the Bifrost Bridge
Despite knowing that this was against the direct orders of their king, Heimdall still gave them safe passage to Jotunheim as he wished to know how the Frost Giants had entered Asgard without him knowing. While Volstagg and Fandral mocked Loki as they prepared to depart, he stood alongside the warriors while Heimdall warned that if their return threatened Asgard's own safety, then he would be left with no choice but to leave them all to perish on Jotunheim.

Attack on Jotunheim
Loki and his allies arrive upon Jotunheim
When the group arrived onto Jotunheim, they looked over the barren wasteland planet which had been almost completely devastated by the previous Battle of Jotunheim. Upon seeing the landscape of the planet, Hogun claimed that they should not be there but they continued on their mission, with Sif questioning where the Frost Giants were hiding.

Thor and Loki speak to Laufey on Jotunheim
As they explored the planet, they eventually located Laufey, the King of the Frost Giants who immediately ordered them to leave. However, ignoring Laufey's warning, Thor demanded answers on how Laufey's soldiers had gotten into Asgard to try and steal the Casket of Ancient Winters from Odin's Vault. This quickly led to several threats being made between Thor and Laufey as Odin's name had been insulted. Loki, however, seeing they were vastly outnumbered by their enemy, tried to persuade his brother to retreat. Soon, Thor relented, but as they began to leave, a Frost Giant insulted Thor, causing the prince to attack his foe with Mj√∏lnir leading to a full-on attack.

Loki throws his knives at the Frost Giants
The Frost Giant's army launched an ambush of the Asgardians and they engaged in a fierce battle against their enemies, where Loki began to fight by using his knives to kill those who attacked him. While Sif and Volstagg used to their strength and great fighting skills to gain the advantage, Loki used his magic to attack and confuse the Frost Giants, tricking one into charging at an illusion which caused him to fall to his death while Loki continued fighting.

Loki unexpectedly discovers he's a Frost Giant
During the battle, Volstagg became wounded when a Frost Giant had grabbed his arm resulting in burns, with Volstagg warning the others of this. However, when Loki inadvertently also made physical contact with Raze, Loki had discovered that he was unharmed, unlike Volstagg, and his arm instead turned blue resembling that of a Frost Giant. Loki and Raze looked at each other for a moment before Loki killed him as his arm returned to its normal color. Loki continued to view his blue arm in horror before it returned to his normal shade of skin.

Loki is cornered by Laufey's entire armies
As they became more outnumbered and Fandral was injured when a Frost Giant impaled him, Loki killed the Frost Giant before he ordered the Warriors Three to retreat. Thor, however, refused to stop fighting as the others ran from a Frost Beast while was soon killed by Thor. When they were cornered by Laufey's armies, Odin arrived and attempted to regain the peace between both Asgard and Jotunheim; however, Laufey told him Thor had restarted their long war.

Loki watches while Odin confronts Thor
Odin accepted this unfortunate truth and then took the group back to Asgard through the Bifrost Bridge. Back on Asgard, Odin remained furious at Thor, ordering the Warriors to heal Fandral while Loki still stayed with his family. Loki watched as Odin began telling Thor he had just started a new great war between Asgard and Jotunheim that put innocent Asgardians at risk; however, Thor argued aggressively while Loki stayed quiet and watched from the side.

Loki witnesses Thor being banished to Earth
Odin eventually confessed that he was a fool to think Thor was ready to be king and, when Loki did try to intervene, Odin silenced him with a fierce growl. Calling his own son unworthy, Odin then furiously took away Thor's armor and powers and banished him to Earth. Loki then watched as the now powerless Thor was thrown out of Asgard and Odin sent Thor's hammer after him under the spell meaning that only one worthy of its power would actually be capable of lifting it.

Refusal to Help
Loki speaks with Sif and the Warriors Three
Back within one of the many great halls of Asgard, Loki had closely listened as Volstagg argued with the others about why they should have never allowed Thor to go on his revenge mission, although all the other members of the Warriors Three had noted that there would have been absolutely no chance of stopping Thor's mission once he had decided to attack the Frost Giants resulting in his banishment. While Fandral had also noted that at the very least Thor was merely banished and not dead, noting they would have never survived if the Einherjar guard had not informed the King of their true plans, with Volstagg also questioning exactly how the guard had known.

Loki refuses to help return Thor into Asgard
Despite considering his true heritage following his encounter with the Frost Giants, Loki then told the Warriors and Sif that he was the one who had informed the guard of their journey to Jotunheim while showing little remorse. Despite Sif pleading with him, Loki refused to speak to Odin to convince him to return Thor home as he argued that Thor had proven himself to be a reckless leader and not what Asgard needed in their king before storming out of the room.

Learning His True Heritage
Loki locates the Casket of Ancient Winters
Still thinking on the shocking discovery he had made during his fight against the Frost Giants in which contact with the creatures had not done him any harm like they had done with Volstagg, but had instead changed the color of his skin to a cold blue, Loki made the decision to investigate further. Loki made his way to Odin's Vault and soon found the Casket of Ancient Winters, the ancient weapon of the Frost Giants which had been taken following the Battle of Jotunheim during which the Asgardians' armies had been victorious.

Loki confirms his true Frost Giant powers
Upon touching the device, Loki's skin once again turned blue, causing him to resemble a Frost Giant and confirming his worst fears. He was interrupted as Odin arrived inside the room and ordered his son to stop. Upset and tearful, Loki refused, demanding to know what really happened and who he really was. 

Loki demands some more answers from Odin
As Loki questioned if the Casket was not the only thing he had taken from Jotunheim following his victory, Odin finally relented, telling Loki of how he had discovered him as an unwanted infant and taken him in. Mortified, Loki questioned why Odin had done this following the slaughter of so many Frost Giants, with Odin claiming that Loki was just an innocent child he had saved.

Loki learns the truth about his birth from Odin
Loki did not accept this answer and desperately demanded the truth, and was told Odin thought his presence within Asgard could bring about an alliance in the Nine Realms and foster a permanent peace, but then confessed there was little hope of this now following their start of the second war. Loki then asked coldly if he was a monster, or nothing more than another stolen relic which Odin would lock away within his vault until he had might finally have some use for him.

Loki witnesses Odin fall into the Odinsleep
Expostulating upon how it all made sense now that Odin had always favoured Thor, Loki furiously berated Odin in denial, accusing him of using him as a tool for peace until Odin, overcome with stress, fell into the Odinsleep. In emotional turmoil, and suddenly worried and confused rather than angry, Loki desperately called out to the Einherjar for some aid.

Taking the Throne
Loki speaks to Frigga about his own past
With Odin having been temporarily rendered comatose due to falling into the Odinsleep, Loki sat by his bedside with Frigga, he asked her more questions about his heritage following his discovery of being part Frost Giant and the son of Laufey, wanting to know why the truth had been kept from him for so many years as Frigga insisting they had not wanted him to feel any different.

Loki is handed Gungnir while Odin sleeps
During their conversation, Frigga insisted that they must not lose hope that Odin would awake and Thor may at last return from his banishment to Earth, although Loki questioned what hope there still was for Thor, with Frigga insisting there was always reason behind Odin's actions. Despite Frigga's attempts to comfort him, Loki could not accept the truth as he walked away from his father's own bedside. Before he could leave, however, a guard then arrived and presented Loki with Odin's powerful staff Gungnir, and pronounced Loki as the new King of Asgard while Odin was unable to rule.

Loki finally sits upon the throne of Asgard
Loki took the throne in Odin's place, delighting in all the new power bestowed upon him as he sat in the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf considering how to ensure he maintained the power of ruling the Nine Realms for as long as possible. While on the throne, King Loki was then visited by the Warriors Three and Lady Sif, who was immediately shocked by the disappearance of Odin and Loki's new position, as Loki told them that whatever issue they had should be brought to him.

Loki refuses to end Thor's long banishment
Reluctantly accepting their newest king, the warriors then requested that the end Thor's banishment, but Loki refused, claiming his first action as king could not be to undo his father's last, also insisting that the Asgardians needed some consistency before they headed into a war against Jotunheim. Before Volstagg could argue the matter any further, Loki ordered them to leave, and Fandral pulled Sif away before she could confront King Loki with any violence.

Keeping Thor in Exile
Loki speaking with Thor down on the Earth
Seeking to ensure that there was no risk of Thor returning back to Asgard and taking the throne away from him, Loki paid a visit to his brother on Earth where Thor had been captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. while trying to regain Mj√∏lnir. Thor asked Loki what had happened on Asgard, questioning if something had happened with Jotunheim, but Loki lied to him and told Thor that Odin had died, in an attempt to keep him completely unmotivated and emotionally destroyed.

Loki leaving Thor behind on the Earth
Loki continued his lie by claiming that Thor's banishment combined with the latest war against Laufey and the Frost Giants had simply been too much for Odin to bear, resulting in his untimely death. Loki then informed Thor that he had been forced to take on the burden of the throne and that the peace was dependent on Thor's banishment from Asgard. When Thor tried to argue that they could find a way for him to return home, Loki claimed that Frigga forbid his return.

Loki fails to lift his brother's hammer, Mj√∏lnir
Thor sadly agreed and said goodbye to his brother and thanked him for coming, accepting that the death of their father and the disasters that had befallen their family had all fallen to him as he accepted his fate to remain on Earth for the rest of his life. After leaving Thor in his holding cell to be questioned by Phil Coulson, Loki attempted to lift Thor's hammer but failed as this betrayal of his brother's trust proved him to be unworthy of wielding it, much to Loki's annoyance.

Starting a War
Dealing with Laufey
Loki making his visit to Laufey on Jotunheim
In an attempt to play the long game to ensure he remained in power, Loki then traveled to Jotunheim where he then visited Laufey. However, upon seeing him, Laufey ordered his Frost Giants to kill the prince, only for Loki to then introduce himself as the one who had given them safe passage into Asgard to attempt to steal the Casket of Ancient Winters, claiming he had only done it for a big of fun to ruin Thor's royal coronation, stopping his brother from ruling Asgard.

Loki then struck a deal to allow Laufey to go to kill Odin while he was still in the Odinsleep and take the Casket of Ancient Winters back to Jotunheim, which Odin had once taken from them, which would have allowed Laufey to finally restore Jotunheim to all its former glory. Loki told him Laufey could not be seen killing the Allfather himself as this would result in the people of Asgard never accepting him as the king if he did. Laufey accepted Loki's offer and allowed him to leave.

Loki returns to discover Heimdall awaiting him
Returning to Asgard via the Bifrost Bridge, Loki had found himself being immediately confronted by Heimdall, who claimed that Loki was using his magic to block his gaze upon him while he was in Jotunheim, as Heimdall had come to believe that Loki was currently attempting to hide his true intentions from him. Loki, however, claimed that Heimdall's powers were becoming weaker from his many years of service to Asgard, which added to Heimdall's suspicions.

Loki's many lies are confronted by Heimdall
Loki began questioning if Odin had ever feared Heimdall despite his incredible power, to which Heimdall answered that he had not as he was loyal to his king. Hearing this, Loki reminded him that he was his king and therefore was forced to obey his orders without question and with complete loyalty. When Heimdall agreed, Loki ordered him not to allow anyone else to use the Bifrost until he had repaired all of the damage that was done by some of Thor's previous actions.

Sending the Destroyer
Loki calls upon the Destroyer to kill Thor
Despite his direct orders, Loki soon learned that the Warriors Three and Lady Sif had used Himinbjorg and traveled to Earth via the Bifrost Bridge. Knowing that his brother would soon learn of his treasonous lies, Loki decided that he had no choice but to silence all those who had betrayed the throne. Therefore Loki had called on his most powerful weapon, the Destroyer and ordered it to travel to Earth and destroy everything it found and kill his enemies.

Loki furiously banishes Heimdall for treason
Furious at the betrayal, Loki made his way to the end of the Bifrost and confronted Heimdall over his treason. Heimdall, however, made it clear that he knew that Loki was responsible for bringing the Frost Giants into Asgard and had, therefore, betrayed his own family and the citizens of Asgard by his actions. In response to his act of treason against the throne, Loki proceeded to strip Heimdall of all titles and finally banished him from the Kingdom, never to return again.

Loki successfully freezes Heimdall alive
However, Heimdall knew he was now free of his oaths to the new king and responded by drawing Hofund and furiously swinging the blade at Loki. However, Loki was prepared for such an attempt against his life and, when Heimdall had attempted to kill his king, Loki used his Magic to then summon the Casket of Ancient Winters, successfully freezing Heimdall alive before he could be struck down, before Loki then left Asgard's gatekeeper to die while trapped in the ice.

Loki closely watches the Destroyer's rampage
Seeking to tie up all other loose ends before his schemes could be exposed, Loki then sent the Destroyer down onto the Earth pursue and destroy Thor and all of the others who had betrayed him. Loki watched from the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf while the Destroyer arrived on Earth and charged through S.H.I.E.L.D. before it then caused a huge battle between the Lady Sif and Warriors Three as the Destroyer who laid waste to the small town which Thor had been staying in.

Loki witnesses Thor regaining all of his powers
When he saw no other end to the battle, the still powerless Thor had stepped up to the Destroyer completely unarmed and pleaded with his brother to allow all the Humans to go free and take his own life in exchange. Accepting this offer, Loki had the Destroyer punch Thor, breaking all of his bones and killing him. This, however, had proved his worthiness and Thor got his former powers back, easily defeating the Destroyer with Mj√∏lnir as Loki looked on in complete horror.

Betraying Laufey
Loki welcomes Laufey into Asgard
Knowing he had to move his plans forward, Loki then welcomed Laufey and his small army of Frost Giants to Asgard and showed him the way to Odin, walking past the frozen body of Heimdall on their way. Laufey came to Odin's bedroom, attacking and knocking down Frigga who attempted to defend her husband before finding his greatest enemy defenseless as he lay in his Odinsleep now completely unguarded.

Loki betrays and kills his father Laufey
Laufey stood over Odin's sleeping body and mocked the King of Asgard as he made an ice blade form in his hand. Just as Laufey was about to kill Odin with the blade, Loki returned and betrayed his true father, shooting him in the back with Gungnir. As Laufey stared in shock and horror, Loki told him his death came from the son of Odin. Loki then killed his cold-hearted father with a single powerful blast from Odin's spear.

Loki is confronted by the returning Thor
As Frigga ran to her son, Thor returned to Asgard with all his powers restored, as Heimdall had survived and returned him through the Bifrost Bridge. Thor arrived in Asgard mere moments after Loki had killed Laufey. He told their mother all about Loki's attempt on his life with the Destroyer while Loki attempted to talk his way out of the situation. Loki fired his spear's energy at Thor and shot him through a wall before making his way to Himinbjorg.

Duel at the Rainbow Bridge
Loki begins to destroy Jotunheim
Loki traveled to the Bifrost Bridge and aimed its full power at Jotunheim where it began ripping through the center of the planet. To ensure that it could not be stopped, Loki then froze it with the Casket of Ancient Winters so the energy would continue to slowly destroy the planet and wipe out the Frost Giants for good so he could be recognized as the King who ended the war.

Loki is confronted by the furious Thor
Thor arrived to see the destruction being caused and tried to convince his brother not to massacre an entire race, but Loki refused and continued to mock and threaten Thor. It was soon proven that Thor would be unable to use Mj√∏lnir to stop the destruction and Loki argued that massacring the Frost Giants was the right thing to do. Eventually, he threatened to kill Jane Foster, causing the furious Thor to attack him to protect the lives Loki threatened.

Loki battles Thor to the death
The brothers fought a violent battle with Loki often using tricks to get the upper hand on his brother. Loki continued to use Gungnir to his advantage, both as a spear and using its energy to shoot at Thor while laughing maniacally every time he managed to outwit and hit his furious brother. They eventually charged at one another and threw each other through the wall and out onto the rainbow bridge, and Loki was thrown over the edge and was barely able to hold onto the side.

Loki creates multiple illusions of himself
As he begged his brother to help him, Thor, seeing his brother in need, bent down to help, only to learn that Loki had indeed tricked him and created an illusion. Loki sneaked up behind him and stabbed him in the side with Gungnir; as Thor lay wounded on the ground, Loki created multiple versions of himself, all laughing maniacally at him. Enraged Thor slammed his hammer on the ground, causing a shock wave which caused Loki to be knocked backwards.

Losing All Hope
Loki becomes trapped underneath Mj√∏lnir
As Loki lay injured on his back, Thor calmly walked over to him and placed Mj√∏lnir on his chest, trapping him onto the floor, unable to move. Thor then began to consider how he could possibly stop the destruction of Jotunheim, as there was no way to stop the beam of Bifrost energy, all while Loki mocked his brother for trying and failing. Thor knew there was only one way he could stop the deaths of millions of Frost Giants.

Loki watches while Thor destroys the Rainbow Bridge
Thor retook his hammer and began to destroy the Rainbow Bridge as Loki looked on in sheer horror at what his brother was attempting to do. Attempting to stop him however he could, Loki reminded Thor that if he destroyed the bridge, then he would never see Jane Foster ever again, but Thor ignored him and continued his task. Loki chose to leap at his brother to stab him in the back, but before he could, the bridge was destroyed and the brothers were thrown into the air.

Loki allowing himself to fall into a wormhole
Thor destroyed the Rainbow Bridge and the pair began to fall into the abyss, only for both of them to be saved at the last minute by Odin, who had awoken from his Odinsleep. They both hung before a black hole and Loki tried to convince Odin that he had done it all for them, with Odin rejecting Loki's pleas. Loki, devastated by Odin's rejection of his actions, let go of Thor and fell into an abyss, before entering into a wormhole created by the energy of the Bifrost Bridge.

New Alliance
Working for Thanos
Loki makes a deal with The Other
Traveling through the wormhole, Loki arrived in a part of the universe called Sanctuary and met the Mad Titan Thanos and The Other, the former who offered a pact that would allow him to become ruler of the Earth while he would take the Tesseract which was being studied by S.H.I.E.L.D.. Thanos provided Loki with a Scepter with a blue gem which acted as a powerful weapon, and also as a mind control device.

Loki takes control of Erik Selvig's mind
Unbeknownst to Loki, his use of the Scepter was also influencing him, fueling his hatred and desire to bring harm to humans and Thor. Thanos showed Loki how to temporarily control someone while still on the planet. Doctor Erik Selvig was taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where Nick Fury showed him the Tesseract asked him to study it. Loki influenced Selvig to ensure that he agreed. Later, Frigga learned that Loki had survived and tried to make contact with him, but Loki told her it was not the time to talk.

Chitauri Invasion
Arrival on Earth
Loki arrives at a S.H.I.E.L.D. Facility
Accepting Thanos' deal without fear of failure, Loki turned his focus back to Erik Selvig, who had been summoned by S.H.I.E.L.D. with the task of unlocking the Tesseract's secrets. Selvig came to understand the cube's capabilities, and through Loki's influence, he developed equipment that would focus its power. When the time was right, Loki activated the Tesseract, forming a portal that pulled him through space to its location on Earth, the main facility of Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S..

Loki puts Clint Barton under mind control
Upon arriving at the facility, Loki was immediately confronted by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who ordered him to put down his weapon. When Loki attacked the agents with powerful blasts of energy, the agents fired on him only to learn that bullets bounced off his body. Once he had killed or subdued all his attackers within seconds, Loki managed to use the Scepter's power to subjugate and control Hawkeye and Selvig, as well as another agent by placing the tip of the scepter at their chest near their heart and allowing the power of the gem to overtake their free will.

Loki meets and threatens Nick Fury
As Loki gathered his slaves, Nick Fury attempted to keep him away from the Tesseract and escape unseen. Loki, however, spied the S.H.I.E.L.D. Director and tells him to leave the cube. Introducing himself and explaining he was Asgardian, Loki explained to Fury that he wanted the Tesseract as part of his glorious purpose which was to free the Earth and humanity from freedom, which he defined as life's great lie, vowing that he would become their one supreme king, although Fury questioned his goals for peace and argued that he wanted war.

Loki attempts to make his escape
Fury tried to flee with the Tesseract but then decided to stay and allow himself to die with the cube if it meant stopping Loki as well. Selvig and Hawkeye informed Loki of Fury's intent, prompting Loki to gather the turned agents and leave with the Tesseract but not before ordering Hawkeye to shoot and kill Fury. The group then made their way to the Jeeps where they avoided Maria Hill's attempt to stop them. As they made it outside, the energy the cube had unleashed consumed the area and the entire compound with it.

Loki shoots down Nick Fury's helicopter
As they drove away from the wreckage of the facility, trapping Hill inside, Fury, who had survived the gunshot due to a Bulletproof Vest, flew over them in a helicopter. Unwilling to allow Loki to escape with such a dangerous weapon, Fury fired his gun at the Asgardian, so in response Loki fired a single blot of energy from his Scepter, shooting the helicopter out of the sky. Fury barely survived the crash and continued to fire at the jeep as Barton drove them to safety; despite being under fire, Loki appeared relaxed and pleased with his success. 

Testing the Tesseract
Loki communicates with The Other
Before long, Loki and his small but ever-growing army had been successful in securing an area to determine the next course of action for the Tesseract while Erik Selvig continued his experiments to learn how to control and use its power. While watching his men work, Loki noted the Scepter's gem glowing and calling out to him. He allowed himself to enter a trance where he could appear to The Other and his Chitauri army across deepest space in a metaphysical form.

Loki and The Other discuss Thanos
While on the Sanctuary, Loki mocked the Chitauri and asked if they were truly as formidable as he had been promised. The Other furiously reminded Loki of how he had been given a second chance after being cast out and defeated by Asgard. The Other then warned Loki that if he failed at his pursuit of Earth or the Tesseract was kept from Thanos, that there would be no place for him to hide from the Mad Titan's wrath and, when he was found, before long he would beg for something as sweet as pain.

Loki speaks with Erik Selvig and Hawkeye
Now unsettled about potential failure and more determined than ever, Loki met with Selvig and Clint Barton to discuss their next course of action to complete their plans. While Selvig commented on the incredible power and knowledge that the Tesseract was providing him, he explained that what he would need was iridium, necessary to stabilize the portal. Loki also spoke to Hawkeye about the team of Avengers that Nick Fury was forming. To gain the Iridium, Loki went to Stuttgart, Germany with Hawkeye and other turned agents.

Skirmish in Germany
Loki steals Heinrich Schafer's eyeball
In Germany, Loki causes a distraction by disrupting a gala at a large museum while Hawkeye, along with a few men, raids a secure installation for Iridium. Loki struck terror into the hearts of guests by securing the one thing needed for Hawkeye to breach the security measures: Heinrich Schafer's eyeball. Loki, disguised in a suit, attacked Schafer, grabbed the man and flipped him onto a bench, then used a special device to saw into Schafer's eyeball, allowing Barton access to steal the Iridium. 

Loki forces a crowd in Germany to kneel
Loki strode out after the screaming crowd into the streets where he made several copies of himself, trapping the people and demanding that they kneel before him. As he looked upon the humans cowering in fear at his power, Loki could only laugh at those he deemed lesser than himself. Loki bragged that this was man's purpose to be ruled and that in the end, they would always kneel before him, but a single man stood up and challenged him and his intentions. The man said he would not kneel before a man like him, Loki arrogantly argued that there were and never had been men like him as he deemed himself vastly superior to all humans though the old man corrected Loki that he was no different from any other would-be conquerer by declaring that there are always men like him.

Loki fights against Captain America
When Loki prepared to kill the old man, Captain America appeared and challenged him, deflecting the bolt of energy back at Loki with his shield. Seconds later, an armed Quinjet carrying Black Widow also challenged him from the sky. Loki fired a bolt of energy at the Quinjet, missing, and Captain America threw his shield at him. Loki engaged in a brief but brutal battle with the super-soldier, during which Loki gained the upper hand and stood above the Captain, demanding he kneel; Cap refused and continued fighting Loki.

Loki surrenders to the Avengers
Just as Loki once again gained the upper hand and began beating Captain America into submission, they were interrupted by the arrival of Iron Man, who shot Loki in the chest and threatened to fire all his weapons upon Loki, daring him to make a move. Realizing that the Avengers had been assembled and he was now outmatched, Loki allowed himself to be captured, using his magic to remove his armor. As the Avengers took Loki into custody, he secretly began plotting how to use this situation to his advantage in the end.

Captured
Loki is captured and taken away on a Quinjet
As they journeyed to the Helicarrier on board the Quinjet, Loki sat in silence while Captain America and Iron Man discussed what his plans could be and why he had allowed himself to be captured so easily. The conversation stopped, however, when lightning began shooting from the sky, signaling the arrival of Loki's brother. As predicted, Thor arrived and extracted Loki from the jet and the Avengers' custody.

Loki talking to Thor about his plans
Taking his brother to a nearby mountain where they were observed by Hugin and Munin, Thor attempted to reason with Loki, imploring him to remember that they were once brothers as they had been raised together and spent years playing and fighting together. Thor asked him to return home to Asgard and surrender the Tesseract. Loki, however, still resented his brother and refused to cooperate, claiming that Odin was not his real father. When Loki mentioned his knowledge of the Tesseract, Thor demanded to know how he knew so much but Loki refused to say Thanos' name.

Loki watches Thor fighting Iron Man
Thor regained Mj√∏lnir and threatened his brother, but before he could get the information he needed from Loki about the Tesseract's location, Thor was tackled by Iron Man and knocked off the side of the mountain. Loki remained on his perch and watched, pleased, as his enemies began to battle each other over who should take Loki into custody. As the argument escalated, Thor and Iron engaged in a fierce fight which ended when Captain America intervened and convinced them that they should ally themselves.
