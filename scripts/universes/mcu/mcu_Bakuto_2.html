<html><p>Handgun: Bakuto used a handgun to shoot Joy Meachum in the gut, ensuring that the wound was clear in and out so that Meachum had a chance of surviving if she was taken to Metro-General Hospital before she could bleed out.
Other
Resurrection Elixir: Like the other leaders of the Hand, Bakuto was able to take the bones of Dragons and turn them into an Elixir which could both extend his life, but also resurrect him upon his death, using this when Davos had fatally stabbed him in the heart.
