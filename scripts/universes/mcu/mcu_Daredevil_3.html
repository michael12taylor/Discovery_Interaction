<html><p>Murdock then proceeded to tell him the story of Zuly Almeida and insisted that if he took a night off as Daredevil people would get hurt. Nelson told Murdock that he didn't want to lose him and Murdock assured him he wouldn't. Arriving at the office, the two met up with Karen Page, who proceeded to lay out the cases they had today, including Jacinto, Marino and Maxwell before telling them in private that while they had more clients then ever, they were broke. Murdock insisted they would get by somehow, noting he did not know how, and they moved on to focus on their current clients.

Punisher Hunt
A New Criminal Client
Murdock plays pool with Karen Page
Later, Murdock, Foggy Nelson and Karen Page went to Josie's Bar where they shot pool. When Nelson went to get some more drinks, Page helped Murdock try to shoot. He then heard her heart racing. Murdock picked up another rapid heartbeat as well, mentioning it to Nelson along with the fact that the man had his finger on the trigger of a gun. Murdock went to confront the man named Grotto, a low member of the Kitchen Irish, who was actually looking for both him and Nelson.

Murdock listens to Grotto's horrific story
Taking a seat at their table with Nelson, Murdock, and Page, Grotto described a massacre in which every Irish member was killed by some kind of army. After listening to his heart beat, Murdock knew he was telling the truth and warned that he would become a target for going to them for help. Grotto then claimed that he only wanted to be placed in witness protection. Grotto then told them he would give the police anything if he could get out of New York City, and he told them all he wanted was a second chance to do right. He then collapsed, from a wound he had sustained during the gunfire.

Murdock and Nelson are told of a massacre
Murdock and Nelson went to the scene of the massacre which was now being investigated by the New York City Police Department. Meeting up with Brett Mahoney, who refused to tell them anything, Murdock used his superhuman hearing to listen in on the cops who revealed that the gangsters were wearing body armor. Mahoney relented and told the lawyers that this wasnâ€™t the first huge gang hit, and that the police thought a paramilitary outfit of some sort was behind the attacks. Mahoney then warned them to keep their witness away. Murdock decided to investigate further, as Daredevil.

Confronting Turk Barrett
Daredevil interrogates Turk Barrett
Daredevil disrupted the deal going on between Turk Barrett involving firearms. After defeating the thugs and Barrett, Daredevil interrogated Barrett, asking about who had supplied the weapons that had caused the Massacre at the Burren Club. When Daredevil literally twisted his arm, Barrett told Daredevil that the Mexican Cartel might be behind the attack before he was then knocked out by Daredevil and left for the police to arrive and arrest him once again.

Daredevil finds the massacred Mexican Cartel
Daredevil then went to the location given to him by Barrett where the Mexican Cartel were hiding out, only to discover most of them dead and hung on meat hooks. As he sensed over the scene, Daredevil discovered that only one person was still being alive, clinging to life despite being injured horrifically and left to die on the hook. Daredevil carefully took the man off the meat hook and then asked what had happened. As the tried to stay alive while slowly bleeding to death from his injuries, the gang member eventually revealed that it was not a whole army targeting the gangs, but only one man.

Finding the Punisher
Daredevil is shot in the head by the Punisher
Daredevil located the culprit who was about to kill Grotto with a sniper rifle outside Metro-General Hospital. The two engaged in a brutal fight where Daredevil found himself surprised by the man's brutal savagery and strength. Daredevil eventually seemed to finally gain the upper hand, only for the shooter to take out a pistol and shoot Daredevil in the head, knocking him off the building.

Murdock recovers with Foggy Nelson's help
The gunshot knocked Murdock unconscious, but did not penetrate his helmet, which was damaged. Murdock remained unconscious until the following morning, when Foggy Nelson found him. Nelson managed to get back to Murdock's home without being noticed. Nelson once again expressed anger and exasperation at Murdock's vigilantism, but Murdock made it clear that he did not trust the New York City Police Department to handle the shooter. Although he was suffering from a headache and clearly still recovering from the gunshot wound, Murdock wanted to join Nelson and Karen Page at the 15th Precinct Police Station to help get a witness protection agreement for Grotto. However, Nelson insisted that Murdock stay home and recover, and asked him to trust him to do his job.

Murdock suffers a horrific headache attack
Some time later, Murdock attempted to get a glass of water from his sink when his hearing became distorted. Sounds were so loud that they were painful. The sound of an aspirin hitting the tabletop disturbed him so much that he dropped his glass of water. To his shock, he realized that the glass made no sound when it shattered on the floor. He panicked, realizing that he now could no longer hear nor see. After some time, he meditated, and his hearing returned in time for him to hear someone knocking at the door.

Murdock speaks in private with Karen Page
He opened the door to let in Karen Page, who was still shaky after fleeing the shooter the night before. Seeing the broken glass on the floor, she assumed that Murdock had been drinking. When she questioned him about his injuries, he jokingly reminded her that he was blind. She sarcastically replied that she was not an idiot. Backing off, she told him that she would be there for him whenever he felt comfortable telling her what is going on.

Page tells Murdock the shooters name is the Punisher
She then changed the subject, filling him in about Grotto's case, including the fact that DA Samantha Reyes personally met them at the precinct. She also told him that the shooter was being called "The Punisher" and mused if the people of the city had helped create him by cheering on Daredevil. Murdock quickly pointed out that Daredevil had never killed anyone, but she replied that they simply never heard about him killing anyone. Before leaving, she told Murdock that she and Nelson cared about him and that he was worth keeping around.

Murdock visits Potter to fix the suit
As soon as Page left, Murdock brought the damaged helmet to Melvin Potter in his workshop and asked him if he could repair it. Potter was not optimistic, saying that it would be best if he could construct an entire new helmet, as the damage was severe. Murdock convinced him to repair the damaged helmet as best he could so he could go after the Punisher as soon as possible, and then create a new one later.

Murdock enters and inspects the Burren Club
Wearing a black hoodie, Murdock clandestinely inspected the Burren Club where the Kitchen Irish had been massacred. Outside the club, he found a dog's chain and picked up the scent of the dog, who had been injured. He was able to track the dog's movements until he came across a stretch of pavement that was being washed, eliminating the scent. Standing on the street, he picked up the sound of a police radio, and traced the sound back to a small apartment, where a chained dog began barking at him. Murdock calmed the dog with a handful of nearby dog food and listened to the police radio. He overheard plans to draw out The Punisher using Grotto as bait.

Round Two with Punisher
Daredevil stops the Punisher from shooting Grotto
Murdock returned to Melvin Potter's Workshop and donned his newly repaired helmet and suit. He went to the location where the New York City Police Department had set their trap for the Punisher. However, Punisher discovered the trap and attempted to kill several Dogs of Hell members so as to distract the Police Department, he then aim at Grotto in order to kill him. Fortunately, Daredevil found him on the nearby roof and attacked him; the two brawled while the police shot at the Punisher. After a lengthy fight between the two combatants, they crashed through a skylight into the building below. Arising, Daredevil's hearing began to fail him again and he became disoriented. Punisher used this to his advantage, knocking Daredevil unconscious.

Debating with Punisher
Daredevil finds himself as Punisher's hostage
Daredevil awoke from a dream in which a nun was tending to him while he was a boy. Upon awakening, he discovered that he was chained to a chimney on a rooftop. As he struggled against the chains and tried to free himself, the Punisher wished him a good morning. When Daredevil asked him why he didn't remove his mask, he responded that he didn't care about his identity. Daredevil deduced that the man was a soldier and tried to get him to reveal information about himself, asking if he was a Catholic and if he was from New York City but the man warned him not to dig.

Daredevil hears the conversation between Jerry and The Punisher
Daredevil heard someone approaching the roof from inside the building, and asked the Punisher not to hurt him. The Punisher warned Daredevil that if he called attention to himself again, the person approaching the roof was going to get hurt. Daredevil overheard the Punisher speaking to an older man, introducing himself as Frank. The old man and Frank bonded over being veterans in the United States Armed Forces, with Frank revealing he had served as a marine in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the older man served in Vietnam years earlier.

Daredevil rattles chains, getting Jerry's attention
During the conversation, Daredevil strained against his chains, attracting the veteran's attention, but the Punisher simply told the old man the noise was a rat and pressed a gun to the door leading inside the building in a way that the old man couldn't see it. Satisfied that Frank was just on the roof to have a smoke, the old man left and returned to his apartment, sharing one last joke with Frank as he walked away. Alone with the man who called himself Frank, Daredevil accused him of threatening an innocent man, but the Punisher replied that the gun was for Daredevil's benefit.

Daredevil and the Punisher argue about justice
The two began to argue about their differing methods of justice. Daredevil argued that all human beings had a spark of goodness in them and that there was always hope they would find redemption and change their ways to become better people, while the Punisher argued that the criminals Daredevil put away always got out of prison again, and continued to hurt innocents, therefore, Daredevil's methods were worthless. The Punisher claimed that the only way to stop the cycle was to kill them. Daredevil then told the Punisher that he would never stop coming after him, because he was insane and needed to be stopped, so the Punisher knocked Daredevil unconscious by hitting him with his gun.

A Fatal Test
Daredevil finds a gun taped to his hand
When Daredevil regained consciousness, he was horrified to find that the Punisher had duct-taped a gun to his hand. Frank informed him that there was only one round in the chamber and that he was wearing body armor, so the only way to stop him was to shoot him in the head. The Punisher then dragged Grotto into Daredevil's view, explaining that he was going to kill him, and the only way Daredevil could stop him was to shoot the Punisher.

Daredevil frees himself and charges after the Punisher
The Punisher coerced Grotto into telling Daredevil that he had performed hits for the Kitchen Irish while he was working for Nesbitt, while being beaten, Grotto finally admitted to killing an old woman who had witnessed one of the hits. Despite hearing all this, Daredevil refused to shoot Grotto. The Punisher said that he would do it himself, and the only way for Daredevil to stop that from happening would be for him to shoot the Punisher. Murdock, however, found another way - he used the one bullet in the gun to shoot through his chains and free himself.

Daredevil fights and subdues the Punisher
Now free, Daredevil charged forward and attacked the Punisher, but was unable to stop him from fatally shooting Grotto. As Daredevil tried to comfort the dying Grotto, the Punisher took aim at motorcycles parked outside the Dogs of Hell headquarters. With Grotto now dead having bled out from his fatal wound, Daredevil launched himself at the Punisher, but he was still able to take the shot, causing a large explosion, alerting Jimmy the Bear and his men. Daredevil fought and eventually subdued the Punisher, taking him inside the building and placing him in a freight elevator to make their escape quickly.

Fighting the Dogs of Hell
Daredevil fights Jimmy the Bear's soldiers
Just as Daredevil was about to leave the building in the elevator with the still unconscious Punisher, bikers from the Dogs of Hell arrived led by their leader Jimmy the Bear, angry at the destruction of their bikes. The old man from the rooftop emerged from his apartment. Daredevil, knowing the man was in danger, left Frank inside the elevator and grabbed Jimmy, threatening him with the empty gun. Once the man was safe, Daredevil pulled the trigger and chuckled before beginning the fight.

Daredevil fights against the Dogs of Hell
This began a long, protracted fight between Daredevil and the Dogs of Hell, in which Murdock used his superior fighting skills along with the chain he was still trailing to defeat them, smashing out the ceiling lights to force the bikers to fight in the darkness where he had the clear advantage over them as Daredevil did not require light to see. Going down the stairway, Daredevil fought seemingly endless waves of the bikers but kept using his chain as a long-range weapon while he fought hand to hand while always ensuring that he never fatally wounded anybody during his brutal takedowns of the bikers.

Daredevil is strangled by a final biker
Despite the seemingly endless wave of Dogs of Hell fighters attacking him with whatever weapons they had in their hands, Daredevil eventually made it down the stairs having knocked out almost all of his attackers. As he entered the ground floor lobby, Daredevil discovered only three bikers remained, keeping him from freedom. As he was so exhausted, Daredevil was unable to dodge one punch to the head which dazed him and allowed his enemies to gang up and beat him repeatedly in the chest and head, but he quickly recovered and knocked out all but one of the bikers remaining.

Daredevil defeats all the Dogs of Hell soldiers
In the end, one final biker remained, the largest of the group, who used his strength to throw Daredevil across the long hallway and attempted to strange him to death and even came close to breaking the exhausted Daredevil's back, but he was able to free himself and knocked him out by slamming his head repeatedly against the hard concrete floor before performing a flip and landing one final hard kick against his skull. However, once he returned to the freight elevator, he noticed that Frank had escaped into New York City during the chaos of the fight without Daredevil noticing.

Grotto's Funeral
Murdock and Page dress for Grotto's funeral
Back at his apartment, Murdock put on his suit and got ready for the funeral for Grotto. He was visited by Karen Page who helped him with his tie and asked if he was better after taking days off sick, while he had actually been out as Daredevil. They flirted with each other and Page revealed that she had a brother who she had never mentioned before. Once he was ready, Murdock and Page left for the funeral.

Murdock attends Grotto's quiet funeral
Meeting Foggy Nelson, the group went to Clinton Church and listened as Father Paul Lantom explained that was Grotto was a deeply flawed person who had made many mistakes throughout his life while working for the Kitchen Irish. Lantom also revealed, however, that Grotto had spent his every Sunday coming to the church and praying while on his own before handing over all of his money, and once a Rolex watch, into the donation plate in the hopes of finding redemption for his many sins, despite knowing redemption would never come for him, with Lantom pointing out that there was nobody to mourn his death, but the three of them who sat alone.

Murdock speaking privately with Paul Lantom
As they left, Murdock noted that Grotto had not, in fact, died alone, with Nelson adding that he was surrounded by the Dogs of Hell. Murdock let everybody leave while he spoke alone with Lantom, complimenting him on his service. Murdock insisted that Grotto's death was not his fault, explaining about the Punisher's violent actions and asked for forgiveness for not saving him, asking why he felt such guilt for failing Grotto. Lantom explained however that guilt could be a good thing as it could bring him to action, noting that while he likely could not have done more, the guilt meant his work was not finished.

Murdock discusses evidence on the Punisher
Back at Nelson and Murdock Law Office, Murdock and Nelson listened as Page explained that she had found evidence that Frank Castle had been shot in the head during the Massacre at Central Park and that Samantha Reyes had this evidence that Blake Tower had given to Page, explaining that they should try and find Castle. As Nelson left to answer the phone, Page then asked Murdock if she was insane while Murdock was distracted considering this new information before Murdock asked her if she really cared about what happened to Castle.

Murdock and Karen Page sharing a moment
Murdock teased Page, claiming that she was insane before laughing and noting that he loved her compassion which he told her was a great quality to have. However, Murdock was pulled away by Nelson who reminded him that Nelson and Murdock still had clients they had to deal with, noting DiPesta was being sued by his landlord for damaging an elevator and advised that they take the case. When they called out to Page, they discovered she had left and taken the Punisher files, Murdock left to look for her while Nelson told him to find Castle first.

Hunting the Punisher
Daredevil visits Melvin Potter for his helmet
Donning his Daredevil's Suit, Murdock traveled to Melvin Potter's Workshop and requested his new helmet, which Melvin Potter noted was basically indestructible and would easily withstand a bullet to the head. Potter noted that he had been getting requests from criminals for new body armor ever since the Punisher had begun his massacres, which he had refused to provide as he was only protecting Betsy Beatty, Daredevil and himself from now onwards.

Daredevil discusses the Kitchen Irish's attacks
Daredevil traveled to the Burren Club where he caught the attention of Brett Mahoney who was gathering evidence from the massacre. Daredevil questioned what had happened there, but Mahoney refused to help, noting that although he had helped them catch Wilson Fisk they were not allies, although he eventually admitted that it involved the Kitchen Irish. Mahoney then accused Daredevil of causing them problems with the police's respect in New York City before getting a call about a shootout in Central Park, so Daredevil quietly left the club to investigate on his own.

Daredevil begins violently questioning Rory
Daredevil traveled to Central Park where he found several members of the Kitchen Irish had been shot and killed during a violent clash, with the exception of Rory, who was now attempting to cruel away despite several bullet wounds in his gut. Rory attempted to shoot Daredevil, however, he missed his shot and had his arm twisted the wrong way as Daredevil demanded to know what had happened. As he was in agony and slowly bleeding out due to his wounds, Rory finally revealed that Finn Cooley had taken found and kidnapped the Punisher and, upon hearing police cars coming his way, eventually gave up where Cooley and his men had taken the Punisher.

Saving the Punisher
Daredevil fights members of the Kitchen Irish
Traveling to the Kitchen Irish's hideout, Daredevil ambushed several of the thugs sent by Finn Cooley. Using the darkness and his own speed to his advantage, Daredevil knocked out one guard and used the moment of confusion to take out the second. When more thugs were called to investigate, Daredevil attacked and easily subdued them all using his body armor and billy club before continuing his search.

Daredevil stops the Punisher from killing
Daredevil soon found Frank Castle engaged in a shoot out with the Irish having killed Cooley and survived being tortured by Cooley's Irish mobsters. Daredevil saved Castle and promised that the Irish would pay for everything that they had done, although he insisted that they not kill anyone there. As they fought more thugs, Daredevil constantly had to ensure that Castle did not use any weapons to kill the Irish, knocking a gun and a hammer out of his hands, with Castle insulting him for this. Once all the thugs were defeated and knocked unconscious, Daredevil then helped the exhausted Castle to his feet and they escaped into New York City from the hideout.

Daredevil listens to Frank Castle's past
They soon made it to Saint Michael's Cemetery, however, Castle found himself unable to keep walking due to his many injuries and sat down by a grave. Although Castle insisted he was dying, Daredevil stayed by his side and listened as Castle explained his time with the United States Armed Forces and his incredible joy at finally being reunited with his beloved family upon returning to New York City. However, Castle also explained the emotional agony he had felt on the day that his family were brutally murdered at the hands of criminals during a gunfight.

Daredevil watches as the Punisher is arrested
Eventually, members of the New York City Police Department arrived to arrest Castle, with Brett Mahoney aiming his gun at Daredevil while his partner put Castle in handcuffs. As he was being arrested, Daredevil recommended to Mahoney that he take the credit for Castle's capture in order to give the people of New York faith in the police department again. Mahoney reluctantly accepted this idea as his best move and let Daredevil go free, with Daredevil later watching from a safe distance as Castle was loaded into an ambulance to recover from his wounds in hospital.

Night with Karen Page
Murdock joins Foggy Nelson and Karen Page
Murdock joined Foggy Nelson and Karen Page for a drink at Josie's Bar as they watched a news report on the capture of the Punisher, celebrating the fact that Officer Brett Mahoney was getting all of the credit for the arrest. Page noted that now Castle was in custody, Samantha Reyes would find it easy to use him for her gain. Nelson went to get more drinks to distract them while Murdock and Page discussed her brother.

Murdock and Karen Page share a kiss
As they left Josie's Bar, Nelson teased Murdock that if he continued with Page then he might end up actually being happy which he joked would be terrible for someone Catholic like him. While Nelson left to get a taxi, Murdock offered to walk Page home in the rain. Once the rain died down, Murdock stopped and used his finger to gently wipe away a single drop of water from Page's arm. The pair then kissed each other before Murdock offered to take Page to dinner the next day. She eagerly agreed before Murdock wished her good night and let her catch a taxi while he then walked home.

Elektra's Return
The Surprise Visit
Murdock is greeted with the return of Elektra
Once Murdock stepped into his apartment, he got himself a drink and smiled thinking about his kiss with Karen Page. However, just as he relaxed, Murdock heard a noise that alerted him that somebody else was there. Drawing a knife, Murdock realized the other person was Elektra, who greeted him with an amused smile.

Murdock refuses to accept Elektra's offering
Murdock scolded her, asking her what she was doing in his apartment. At first, she stated that she missed him. She apologized for leaving him all those years ago, but told him she was in New York to be at a meeting. She revealed that her late father invested a lot of money in the Roxxon Corporation and requested that Murdock represent her for an upcoming meeting with the board of directors. Murdock mocked her and refused the offer, even when she went as far as to pay him. He then ordered her to leave.

Karen Page's Updates
Murdock learning about Karen Page's actions
The next day, Murdock went to his office and Foggy Nelson offered him a piece of peach pie, calling it their last payment. Murdock apologized, blaming himself for the firm doing poorly and being too distracted as Daredevil. Nelson stated that he was just glad to be safe and was relieved that Castle was behind bars. When Karen Page arrived, she began to talk about the Punisher. She showed them newspaper articles that did not report on Castle's military service nor the tragic death of his family. Murdock asked how she knew all this, and she confessed that she broke into Castle's house, much to Murdock and Nelson's disapproval.

Murdock confirming the date with Karen Page
After Nelson suggested forgetting about Castle and finding actual clients, Page apologized to Murdock about not letting go of the Punisher case and Murdock reassured her that he just wanted her safe. Page began to talk about the night after Josie's Bar, but Murdock joked that he didn't remember anything happening. He confirmed that they were still on for a dinner date, later. Then, Nelson came out of his office, informing them that they received a huge deposit in their account. Murdock knew it was from Elektra, but stated that it was from a potential client, then he left.

Spying on Elektra
Murdock arrives outside the Yakatomi Building
Murdock went to the Yakatomi Building as Elektra entered and met with the Roxxon Corporation's board of Directors. He snuck up on the rooftops and began to listen. However, he was unaware that Elektra saw him during her meeting.

Murdock listens to Elektra during her meeting
While Elektra talked to the board, she pulled out a pen, placing it on the table. Murdock, however, heard a low sound emanating from it. Suddenly, the phones began to ring and a few members of Roxxon claimed that the servers were hacked. As the members began to reschedule their meeting with Elektra, Murdock left.

Dinner with Karen Page
Murdock and Karen Page start their first date
Later, Murdock joined Karen Page at a restaurant for their date. He was trying to decide what kind of wine to get and tried to ask how her day went. When Page had to excuse herself from the table, the waiter approached him stating that he had a phone call. When he picked up, he found out it was Elektra, revealing that she knew he was at the Yakatomi Building. She told him that he was fired; she then hung up.

Murdock takes Page to a different restaurant
Later, Page returned, wondering why Murdock had left their table, but he claimed that he didn't like the restaurant. They went to a more low-budget Indian restaurant instead, toasting to "the cheap stuff." They started talking about what they loved about New York City. Then, Murdock and Page walked to her home, where they began to kiss. She invited him inside, but he declined the offer, telling her that he wanted to keep the night perfect. They said goodnight and Murdock left.

Ambush at Elektra's Penthouse
Murdock questions Elektra's true intentions
Later that evening, Murdock went to Elektra's Penthouse, as he had begun questioning her about why she took him to Roscoe Sweeney's house when they were in college. She stated that she saw inside of him "glorious darkness" and she wanted to see if he could kill Sweeney.

Murdock learns that Elektra manipulated him
Then, Murdock heard someone's footsteps, Elektra stated that it was the Yakuza, as she went into another room and changed clothes. Murdock realized that she tricked him into fighting with her, telling her that she didn't know him. In response, she opened a bag that contained his Daredevil's Suit inside. Elektra then pulled up her cowl, getting ready to fight.

Daredevil attacks all of the Yakuza by surprise
Murdock suited up, then hid. Later, the assassins broke in, looking for Elektra. Later, Daredevil and Elektra revealed themselves and then began to fight. After a long battle, they easily knocked out all the supposed Yakuza soldiers. As Elektra caught her breath, she pulled down her cowl and asked if Murdock was hungry, but Murdock was still furious.

Breakfast with Elektra
Murdock questioning Elektra inside the diner
The next morning, Murdock and Elektra began to eat at a diner. He demanded to know why the Yakuza was after her and she told him that she hacked into Asano Robotics's servers, and they had connections to the Yakuza organization. She stated that even though he took down Wilson Fisk, the Yakuza merely hid and bid their time. He then asked her how she knew he was Daredevil. She answered that she recognized his ass on the news, even with the costume on.

Murdock telling Elektra that he has no feelings
Elektra asked Murdock to help her figure out the connection between the Yakuza and the Roxxon. He reluctantly agreed to help, on the condition that she won't kill anyone and that she leave New York as soon as they were finished. He then told Elektra that he was dating someone else, and had no desire to rekindle their past relationship.

Discussing the Punisher
Murdock learning of Frank Castle's sentence
Murdock arrived the office late, in time to hear Castle's public defender, Christopher Roth, explain to Foggy Nelson and Karen Page that Samantha Reyes was trying to extradite Frank Castle into Delaware, a state which had the death sentence. After that, Roth left the office, leaving Page and Murdock trying to convince Nelson to take on Castle as their client.

Murdock telling Foggy Nelson to set up a plea
Furiously, Page informed both Nelson and Murdock how frustrated she was with how Reyes was handling Castle's case. Murdock told Nelson that they didn't have to defend his actions, but merely negotiate a plea bargain that took extradition off the table. Nelson refused. When Page left so that Nelson and Murdock could talk in private, Nelson made it known that he was surprised that Murdock would want to help Castle after he held him hostage. Murdock told Nelson that he felt his actions were not worth the death penalty. Reluctantly, Nelson finally agreed, telling Page to pack her things as the three left to meet Castle in the hospital.

Meeting with Frank Castle
Murdock, Nelson and Page find heavy security
When they entered Metro-General Hospital, they found the entire place filled with security guards and police. Having shown their IDs, they were allowed to pass through. Brett Mahoney, now appointed as Detective Sergeant for his actions, informed them that Castle already got a lawyer and was against them from speaking to Frank Castle, knowing it would be against Samantha Reyes' wishes. Murdock, Karen Page, and Foggy Nelson convinced him that they had a right to interview a prospective client, and he sent them into Castle's room. When they entered, Mahoney warned them to not cross the tape that surrounded his bed.

Murdock speaks with Frank Castle in hospital
Murdock was the first to confront Castle, introducing himself, but Castle stated that he knew who they were, and criticized how they defended scumbags that deserved to die. Murdock talked to Castle about possibly negotiating a plea, but Castle rejected his offer. However, Page, ignoring Mahoney's rule about the tape, stormed towards Castle and showed him the photo of his wife and two children, telling him that if he got the death penalty, then he would be unable to find answers to his family's murder.

Murdock calmly argues with Samantha Reyes
However, Reyes then arrived in Castle's room, angry that Nelson and Murdock were talking to Castle without Christopher Roth, accusing them of breaching of ethics. However, Murdock chimed in, stating that they had a right to find potential clients. Reyes found it odd, noting that they represented Grotto before, causing a conflict of interest. Then, Mahoney came out of Castle's room and delivered the news that that Castle had asked to have Nelson and Murdock represent him in court.

Murdock gets approached by Elektra's driver
The three entered an empty room and began to strategize the case, feeling the need to use all their files on Castle, until a chauffeur arrived, asking for Murdock. Murdock knew that the chauffeur had been sent by Elektra, but told Nelson and Page that he had scheduled a meeting with a wealthy client and, with that, he left.

Spying on the Yakuza
Murdock being given his new tux by Elektra
Murdock entered a car with Elektra, who then presented him with a new tuxedo, much to his annoyance. As he put on the tuxedo, she revealed that they were heading to a gala being held by the Roxxon Corporation in order to steal a key card from Stan Gibson and enter a secret room that should contain a ledger that describes the Yakuza's activities with Roxxon.

Murdock and Elektra enter the gala together
As they entered the gala, Murdock took note that Elektra was turning many heads and raising many heartbeats. They were met by a mysterious man named Hirochi, who greeted them both. They finally located Gibson, but when Elektra was about to steal the key, Murdock stopped her, noting that Gibson was being watched.

Murdock takes the key card from Stan Gibson
Instead, Murdock spilled red wine on Gibson's white suit, which caused Gibson to be angry. Gibson calmed down when he saw that Murdock was blind. He walked to the men's room to clean up. Murdock followed him, attacking both Gibson and his bodyguards, knocking them out and stealing his key card. He went back to Elektra and they both went to the thirteenth floor.

Murdock and Elektra locate the secret ledger
Murdock and Elektra went past security and got to the secure room. Murdock used his enhanced senses to crack a safe, however, the ledger was not inside. Then, Murdock used his senses to locate a secret room and Elektra found a way to open it. Finally, they found the ledger. However, the building went on lockdown. As they left, they fought the security that got in their way.

Murdock and Elektra find the ledger is coded
Once they hit a room on the 11th floor, they pretended to be a couple looking for a private room. The security guards saw that Murdock was blind and allowed both of them to leave. Murdock and Elektra got back into the car and began to read the ledger. However, Elektra became confused, stating that part of the ledger was written in code, making it impossible to read. Murdock, being glad that it was over, left the vehicle and went to his apartment.

The People vs The Punisher
Murdock learns they will defend Frank Castle
As Murdock settled in, Foggy Nelson stopped by, annoyed that he missed his calls. He informed Murdock that Frank Castle had pleaded not guilty, with Samantha Reyes requesting a fast track for the trial. Murdock thought it best if they filed for an extension, however, Nelson told him that Castle agreed to the fast-tracked trial. With that, Nelson told Murdock to clear his calendar, because the trial of the People vs. Frank Castle would begin the following week.

Murdock strategizes their Frank Castle case
Back at their Law Office, Murdock strategized with Karen Page and Nelson about Castle's defense. Nelson believed the best way to go about the case was to a plea that Castle had Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, causing him to commit the crimes. Murdock stated that as long as Castle agreed, he would make an opening statement based on PTSD. Page decided to visit Castle to see if he would agree.

Murdock receives his phone call from Elektra
Later, in his office, Murdock started practicing his opening statement, but then he received a call from Elektra. She informed Murdock that she found out who decrypted the ledger of the Yakuza, but he informed her that he was too busy with the trial on Castle. Then, Nelson came into his office and asked Murdock to look up witnesses from the Dogs of Hell. Murdock informed him that he would as soon as he was done with his call. After that, he reluctantly agreed to help Elektra.

Reconnecting with Elektra
Daredevil begins threatening Philip Cabroni
Daredevil and Elektra entered the apartment of Philip Cabroni, who was dealing with two Korean prostitutes. After they left his room, Daredevil and Elektra revealed themselves, shocking Cabroni. They demanded that he decipher the codes in the ledger, which, after a few threats, he agreed to. He revealed that the ledger detailed a list of shipments coming into Hell's Kitchen. One, in particular, was arriving later in the evening. Daredevil threatened Cabroni, telling him to end his dealings with the Yakuza, and Elektra mocked his decorator, then knocked him out. After that, they left.

Daredevil and Elektra open up the railcar door
Daredevil and Elektra arrived at a railroad station, where they found the railcar that Cabroni mentioned in the ledger. They opened the door and dirt rushed out of it, confusing the both of them. Then, the Yakuza attacked them both.

They went to Murdock's Apartment, where he stitched up Elektra's neck. Elektra, looking at Murdock's scars, asked him people said about them, considering that he has seen a bunch of women. He joked that the women would be too busy enjoying themselves.

As they began to show each other their scars, he pointed out one given to him by a man named Nobu, using his Kyoketsu-Shoge. Elektra pointed out that his name was Nobu Yoshioka. Murdock asked Elektra what happened to her the night after they went to Roscoe Sweeney's house, she stated that she went as far away from him as possible, stating that he deserved better. They both, then, went to sleep in the living room.

Testing Friendships
Murdock panics due to him having overslept
The next morning, Murdock started to panic, noting that he overslept and had to be at Frank Castle's case. As he was getting dressed, Elektra told him that she would figure out why the rail car was full of dirt, wishing him good luck in court as he left. Murdock finally arrived at the court, just in time to hear the middle of Foggy Nelson's opening statement. 

Murdock apologizes to both Page and Nelson
Murdock caught up with Nelson and Karen Page in the hallway and apologized to both of them. They were both frustrated that he was so late, but he complimented Nelson on his opening statement. To make it up to them both, he agreed to question Gregory Tepper about the autopsy the next day. Nelson reluctantly agreed to this. Murdock requested that Page get him caught up on everything he's missed in court, later that night.

Talk with Karen Page

Later that evening, Murdock and Karen Page went to his apartment, looking through the autopsy files from Gregory Tepper, trying to figure out a way to get Tepper to confess that the reports were false. While they did that, they began to talk about the first time they met, talking about Page being saved by Daredevil that one night. However, she began to connect Daredevil's vigilante activity to the actions of Frank Castle's. However, Page confessed that she felt that Castle was doing the right thing, causing silence between the both of them. Murdock decided to end the session and promised Page a real date, as she left.

Murdock learns Elektra was eavesdropping
Murdock went upstairs, where Elektra was and scolded her for eavesdropping on their conversation. He told her how much Page and his job meant to him. She explained that she complied with a list of construction sites in Hell's Kitchen that could account for the mysterious rail car full of dirt. Murdock remembered one of the sites as the one which Nobu Yoshioka had blueprints for. He assumed that Yoshioka used that site for Wilson Fisk's personal use, but now realized that Yoshioka might have an alternative motive. However, Murdock told Elektra that he had to be in court for the Castle trial the following morning, then she left.

Gregory Tepper's Testimony

Later, during the court case, Gregory Tepper was questioned by Murdock about the autopsies of the victims that Frank Castle killed. During cross-examination, Murdock asked him how many autopsies he has filled out in the past. However, Tepper then asked if he could make a statement about something he did in the past. Judge Cynthia Batzer asked the jury and spectators to clear the room.

Once all was clear, Tepper confessed that the autopsy of Castle's family and the John Doe were false. He revealed that he was coerced into falsifying the reports. He then revealed that the previous night, a woman with a foreign accent and a mask threatened to kill him if he did not tell them the truth, which shocked Murdock. Samantha Reyes had then accused Nelson and Murdock of threatening the witness. With that, the judge ordered Tepper's testimony stricken from the record.

Murdock followed Foggy Nelson into the bathroom as Nelson was angry, filled with disbelief that Reyes would threaten a witness like that. However, Murdock confessed that it was not Reyes, and that Elektra was the culprit. Nelson did not understand, as he only remembered Elektra as a debutante, while Murdock told Nelson that she came back to Hell's Kitchen and had become dangerous.

Murdock and Foggy Nelson argue about the situation
Murdock, then, confessed that he and Elektra were now spying on the Yakuza and trying to figure out why they were back, confessing that she was the wealthy client that he was talking about and that she was the one who deposited money into their account. Before he could tell Nelson more about what was going on, Nelson lashed out angrily at Murdock, pointing out that he has lied to him again. He angrily claimed that he would no longer trust him, telling Murdock to tell Karen Page about Elektra, and left.

Murdock being asked about all the shouting
Page, curious about the yelling, asked Nelson what was going on. He ignored her and then she asked Murdock, but he told her that he has to leave. However, he promised to talk to her the next day, although she muttered under her breath that she doubted it.

Stick Returns
Daredevil furiously confronts Elektra
Daredevil met Elektra outside of the Midland Circle construction site and let her know that she ruined Frank Castle's case by threatening Gregory Tepper. She responded that she was following his own rules: you don't get what you want by day, you take it by force at night. Furious, he warned her to stay out of his normal life and, stating that Matt Murdock's life was boring, she agreed. Daredevil fought guards at the entry site, then she arrived after the battle, sarcastically remarking that he didn't want her help.

They went inside the construction site, where he confirmed that they were alone. However, he was shocked to find a large hole. He took her flashlight and dropped it down the hole. After a long pause, she asked if it had hit the bottom.  When he responded that it hadn't, she asked him to tell her when it did.

After another long pause, Daredevil heard the flashlight hit the bottom and told this to Elektra. They were then ambushed by mysterious ninjas.

Elektra warned Daredevil that they were using swords, and he found he could track the sounds of their weapons.

Daredevil and Elektra are saved by Stick
The two of them fought off the ninjas and during the battle, Elektra was badly injured. Before one of the ninjas could attack, they were saved by Stick, who finished off the others, telling Murdock that they should get out. They got in a car driven by a man named Quinn. They were followed and attacked by the ninjas, with Stick using a crossbow to take them out. Murdock claimed that he could sense Elektra dying. Stick ordered Quinn to drive them to Murdock's apartment.

Learning of The Hand

Stick talked about an organization of ninja warriors called the Hand, whom he described as an ancient evil. He explained that they were plotting their evil work in New York City. Then, he described their enemy organization called the Chaste, of which Stick and Elektra were both members. Murdock, annoyed, was ashamed that Stick would bring up a ridiculous fairy tale. Stick told him that this was all really happening, warning that the Hand would bring chaos to New York.

Murdock checks in on Elektra's slow recovery
Later, Murdock checked on Elektra while she recovered in bed, and she confirmed everything that Stick had said. When he asked her if the two of them meeting was planned by Stick, she admitted it was. Although she said regardless of her orders, she really did fall in love with Murdock. Murdock admitted that he feared to lose her while she was dying, and suggested she leave Stick and fight the Hand with him instead.

Murdock and Elektra are seen by Karen Page
Then, Murdock realized that someone came into his apartment, and Stick came in and told him that he had a visitor. Karen Page came in and was shocked to see Elektra in Murdock's bed. Murdock told Page that he could explain everything, but she became distant from him as she told Murdock that Foggy Nelson needed his help for the Castle case. Although Murdock suggested they go somewhere to talk, she left quickly, with Stick sardonically calling after her that it was nice to meet her.

Discussing Heroes
Murdock and Foggy Nelson discuss the case
Murdock went to the courtroom as Karen Page had requested. He tried speaking to Page, but she ignored him. He spoke to Foggy Nelson, who, still angry and demanded that Murdock get Frank Castle to retell his story. Castle came to the stand and Murdock heard a guard whisper to him, asking him to think about what he wanted. Murdock tried to get Castle to describe the day his family was killed, but Castle did not respond. Murdock asked Cynthia Batzer for permission to treat Castle as hostile.

Murdock discusses heroes with the jury
Murdock claimed that Castle was just the kind of man his city needed in the wake of Wilson Fisk and then went to the jury and told them about heroes and how New York City needed more men and woman like Castle who were willing to find justice themselves; describing how Castle took it too far by murdering the crooks, noting that Samantha Reyes was trying to stop heroes from taking action. He argued that Castle needed help and not punishment. Despite that, Castle asked to speak and told everyone that he knew what he did and was glad, embracing his title as the Punisher as he was dragged away.

Outside the courtroom, Murdock claimed that someone influenced Castle, but both Page and Nelson ignored Murdock. Nelson angrily exclaimed that he was glad that they lost the case, and Page told Murdock that while she agreed with Murdock about heroes, he was not one of them. She told him she was done with him before storming off.

As Murdock left to give Elektra some rest, he was attacked by a Hand ninja.
