Background
Personality
As a teenager, Ahsoka is snarky, cocky, aggressive, feisty, stubborn, reckless, and impulsive, yet loyal, generous, and kind-hearted. She is quite selfless as she willingly risk her life many times to protect the innocent, as well as her friends. Ahsoka also has very good maternal instincts, being friendly and not above apologizing or admitting when she is wrong. She humbly acknowledges her mistakes and learns from them as well.
Although Ahsoka is usually an honest person, she was capable of lying well enough to fool her master into thinking that Plo Koon had allowed her to join the mission to rescue Even Piell.

During the Clone Wars, Ahsoka matured and became more responsible in many ways. However, unlike her then-mentor Anakin Skywalker, this stopped her from being reckless and impulsive (at least for the most part).

During Ahsoka's brief infection with the dark side on the planet of Mortis during the Clone Wars due to the Son (the physical embodiment of the dark side of the Force), her personality changed completely until she was healed of the infection and returned to the light side. She had became cruel, sadistic, and prone to bouts of complete insanity and rage, venting all her frustrations at Anakin and attempting to kill him for perceived slights towards her. As such, it was fortunate that Anakin and the Daughter (the physical embodiment of the light side of the Force) managed to help return her to normal.

However, when Ahsoka was framed for murder and treason, she was horrified when the Jedi Order coldly cast her out and all but condemned her to a Republic military trial, which came very close to sentence her to death. When Anakin unveiled the true culprit, Ahsoka was shocked to see it was her friend, Barriss Offee.

When Ahsoka was offered to return to the Jedi Order as a full-fledged Jedi Knight, she was deeply conflicted, but ultimately chose not to, having lost faith in the order for not standing by her, and felt she could no longer devote herself to the Jedi Order after it had become clear that it was serving the political interests of the Republic instead of than following its ancient ways and traditions.

As an adult, despite Ahsoka's tragic departure from the Jedi Order on bad terms, she is very calm, level-headed, and mature, with a strong sense of justice, honor, and good morals. Although no longer a Jedi, Ahsoka has taken the teachings to heart to find balance in Jedi tradition and her own morals, allowing her to mature greatly into a distinct Force-user who imparts deep wisdom to her allies.

Despite being generally composed, Ahsoka struggles with her past, and her difficulty coming to terms with it since she was unable to help her friends while on the run from the Empire. Despite everything the Council put her through, Ahsoka felt guilt and remorse for walking away from the Jedi Order, only because she left Anakin behind.

With past ties torn, Ahsoka suffered from severe grief over the fates that had befallen her friends and allies. The most significant blow was her discovery that Darth Vader is in fact her former mentor, Anakin. Even after she entered the Lothal Jedi Temple and discovered how Anakin fell to the dark side, she was still in denial that Anakin and Vader were the same individual. However, after Ahsoka slices off part of Vader's mask, she sees Anakin's disfigured face, and becomes shocked and saddened but she finally accepts that Anakin and Vader are the same person.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Power of the Force: Ahsoka is very powerful and has a very strong connection to the Force, as she is one of the most powerful Force-users in the entire galaxy.
Telekinesis: Ahsoka can telekinetically move objects or other individuals without physically touching them, and she utilizes it for offensive or defensive purposes. Even at a young age, Ahsoka was able to pull down a large piece of wall with a hole inside of it to crush multiple droids without harming Anakin, who was fighting against them. As a teenager, she used the majority of her power to hold onto a medium sized shuttlecraft that was being stolen by Maul and prevent it from flying away, though she soon realized this left her and Rex in a vulnerable, defenseless position against the clones under the influence of Order 66 who were firing on them, which led her to release the ship to be able to protect her last remaining ally.
Force Push: Ahsoka can telekinetically send her opponents flying through the air, causing serious injury or temporarily incapacitating/knocking them unconscious, depending on how much power is unleashed.
Force Pull: Ahsoka can telekinetically pull her opponents or objects towards her.
Force Grip: Ahsoka can telekinetically lift her opponents off the ground and into the air, sometimes by the neck, to immobilize them. She notably throttled a Trandoshan hunter on Island Four, lifting him into the air by the neck before slam him onto the ground.
Force Barrier: Ahsoka can create a barrier or wall of Force energy in front of or surrounding herself or her allies. She notably was able to block the torrents of blue, fiery energy generated by Palpatine's Sith sorcery, although she required assistance from Ezra Bridger to dissipate the flames, if only temporarily.
Saber Throw: Ahsoka can telekinetically guide her lightsaber towards her opponents and return the weapon back to her hand, similar to a boomerang or shuriken. In an attempt to escape the clones attacking her and Rex, she telekinetically maneuvered her lightsabers after throwing them like javelins into the ground they stood on, carving out a hole into which they both fell in, and summoning her lightsabers back into her grasp.
Mind Trick: Ahsoka can control the minds of other sentient beings, except for individuals with indomitable wills.
Force Sense: Ahsoka can sense another sentient being's emotions, the future, ripples in the Force caused by momentous or traumatic events, impending danger, and the presence of other light or dark side Force-users.
Force Vision: Ahsoka can see visions of the past, present, and future. However, like all Force-users, her visions are not always clear or sometimes they happen without warning.
Force Jump: Ahsoka can jump or leap at great distances.
Force Dash: Ahsoka can move at amazing speeds.

Extrasensory Perception: As other members of her kind, Ahsoka has an increased spatial awareness because of her hollow montrals, organs which allow her to sense the objects that move around them.
Abilities
Master Lightsaber Duelist: Ahsoka is a highly skilled lightsaber duelist, as she is one of the deadliest lightsaber duelists in the entire galaxy. Even as a Padawan, she displayed considerable lightsaber combat skills, being able to defeat three Magnaguards single handed, and at least temporarily hold her own against more powerful and experienced opponents, like General Grievous and Asajj Ventress. However, whilst fleeing from the clone troopers after being framed for murder, Ahsoka lost her lightsaber shoto, and was forced to use only her main lightsaber to fight against the recently turned Dark Jedi Barriss Offee. Her duel against her former friend Barriss proved that she had become too reliant on her second lightsaber, as despite her puting up a considerable fight, Barriss ultimately bested her relatively easily. By the time of the events of Star Wars Rebels, Ahsoka's lightsaber combat skills have greatly improved to the point of mastery. This is seen in "The Future of the Force", when she bested the two elite Inquisitors, the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister, relatively easily. In "Twilight of the Apprentice", Ahsoka was able to fight on par against the former Sith Lord Maul, and even hold her own reasonably well against her former mentor, Anakin Skywalker, now the ruthless Sith Lord Darth Vader. She even managed to crack Vader's mask as seen in "A World Between Worlds", but if a future version of Ezra had not rescued her from Vader, she would have been struck down by the Sith Lord.
Form IV: After becoming Anakin's apprentice, Ahsoka trained in Ataru, and became extremely skilled at it.
Form V: Ahsoka is extremely skilled in Shien/Djem So. While still a little girl, Ahsoka trained the Shien variant. After becoming Anakin's student, she studied the Djem So variant.
Form VI: After becoming Anakin's apprentice, Ahsoka trained in Niman, and became extremely skilled at it, integrating telekinetic attacks into her lightsaber moveset.
Jar'Kai: At some point during the Clone Wars, Ahsoka began to study Jar'Kai, and became extremely skilled at it. During her second duel with General Grievous, who was a master of Jar'Kai himself, Ahsoka displayed enough mastery of dual-blade combat to defend herself against all four of the cyborg's lightsabers for an even longer period of time than in their first encounter, which took place before she had began to learn Jar'Kai. By the time of the events of Star Wars Rebels, Ahsoka's skills in Jar'Kai have greatly improved to the point of mastery, as she used it to easily outmatch and overpower the two elite Inquisitors, the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister.
Sai cha: Ahsoka is highly skilled in Sai cha.
Sun djem: Ahsoka is highly skilled in Sun djem.
TrÃ kata: Ahsoka is highly skilled in TrÃ kata.

Expert Hand-To-Hand Combatant: Ahsoka is an extremely skilled hand-to-hand combatant, being able to defeat the veteran Trandoshan sport hunter Garnac and infamous bounty hunter Cad Bane in unarmed combat, despite the fact that they were larger, stronger, and more experienced hand-to-hand combatants than her. While on the run from the Republic, she was also able to defeat several clone troopers at once effortlessly, but refused to kill them.
Skilled Pilot: Ahsoka is highly skilled in piloting most speeders and most types of flying crafts.

Weapons and Equipment
Lightsabers
Ahsoka's valued weapon and possession is her green, yellow-green, blue, and later white-bladed lightsabers. She has had four lightsabers.

First Lightsaber: Ahsoka had built a green-bladed lightsaber which she used throughout most of her Jedi career and most of the Clone Wars. It would remain in Ahsoka's possession until her duel against the Dark Jedi Barriss Offee. She later got it back from Anakin Skywalker, and left it on the false grave as a way of faking her death.
First Shoto lightsaber: At some point, Ahsoka had built a yellow-green-bladed shoto lightsaber. It would remain in Ahsoka's possession until the clones fired a missile close to her to knock her off her feet, whilst fleeing from the clones after being framed for murder. She later got it back from Anakin, and left it on the false grave as a way of faking her death.
Second Lightsaber: By the time of the events of Star Wars Rebels, Ahsoka had built a new white-bladed lightsaber with a curved hilt. The inner components for this lightsaber were taken from an Inquisitor called the Sixth Brother, who she had killed and the kyber crystals were imbued with the light side of the Force, turning them white.
Second Shoto lightsaber: By the time of the events of Star Wars Rebels, Ahsoka had built a new white-bladed shoto lightsaber. Like Ahsoka's standard lightsaber, this curve-hilted shoto was built using inner components from the lightsaber of the Inquisitor known as the Sixth Brother, and its kyber crystals imbued with the light side of the Force, turning them white.
Film Appearances
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
She first appeared in Star Wars: The Clone Wars movie, which is followed by the series, as a new Padawan. Despite Obi-Wan's want of a Padawan, Ahsoka is assigned by Yoda to be Anakin's. At first, Anakin does not want to be her master. After a mission on Christophisis, however, he decides that "she'll never make it as Obi-Wan's Padawan but will make it as his". Soon, she and Anakin are sent to find Jabba the Hutt's son, Rotta, and bring him safely home. She is relieved to find Rotta is only a baby, and thinks him to be cute. She later tries to prove that she's "not too young to be a Padawan". As they are trying to get Rotta out, however, Ahsoka is confronted by Asajj Ventress, a lightsaber-wielding villainess in the pay of Count Dooku. Anakin rescues her, and they depart for Tatooine. On the way, Ahsoka finds some medicine that saves Rotta's life. On the way to Jabba's Palace, Ahsoka asks Anakin about his experience on the planet, but Anakin refuses to discuss it. They formulate a plan - Anakin will hold off Dooku, pretending to have the Huttlet in tow, while Ahsoka breaks for the palace and returns him to Jabba. Despite uncertainties suffered by Dooku and his MagnaGuards, the plan succeeds and Jabba's son is successfully brought home. After this mission, she continues to work alongside her master and Obi-Wan.

Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker
Ahsoka's voice is heard when the Jedi from the past are contacting Rey and encouraging her to defeat Darth Sidious once-and-for all.

Television Appearances
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
Ahsoka during the Clone Wars.
Throughout the series, she fights in battles along Anakin and Obi-Wan. She is sometimes seen arguing with Anakin about each other's flaws. Yet, she seems to grow fond of her master and respects him. Obi-Wan approves of the Council's decision to pair them, but fears they are so similar they will only increase each other's bad habits. She also develops a close friendship with another Padawan, Barriss Offee, who is training under Luminara Unduli. She tries her best to save as many people she can. In The Alter of Mortis, where Ahsoka and company go up against the Father, Son, and Daughter, Ahsoka is temporarily controlled by the dark side of the Force until Anakin and Obi-Wan come to her aid. In The Jedi Who Knew Too Much, Ahsoka is framed for a crime she did not commit regarding a bombing in the Jedi Temple that killed several Jedi, and is expelled from the Jedi Order, turned over to the Republic military, and comes very close to being sentenced to death. Although her name is ultimately cleared, Ahsoka has lost faith in the Jedi Order, since virtually all of its members had refused to believe in her innocence from the very beginning (excluding Anakin Skywalker), and so she refuses the Jedi Council's offer to rejoin the Order. Despite her master's protests, she tells Anakin she has to find her own way, without the Jedi and without him, and sadly walks down the temple steps to whatever and wherever the Force will take her.

Star Wars Rebels
Ahsoka returns in the Disney XD animated series Star Wars Rebels under the name of "Fulcrum", who allies with the Rebels of Lothal and provides missions and intelligence to assist in their fight against the Galactic Empire. To ensure her secrecy and security of her identity, Hera Syndulla is the only member of the Ghost crew who makes contact. Additionally, Ahsoka uses scrambled audio in transmissions to disguise her voice. By season two she becomes a supporting character.

Season One
Ahsoka speaking with Hera in private, under the name of "Fulcrum".
In the series, Ahsoka provides the Rebels with intelligence for missions in order to hit Imperial forces or interests, and those missions are part of a larger plan that the Rebels are part of, one that only Hera knows. Because of all the secrecy, Sabine Wren, the crew's explosives expert, becomes curious and suspicious of who she is, and on rare occasions insists on knowing her identity to no avail. This makes Sabine feel distrusted and want to know why the Rebel missions are becoming so dangerous, but Hera assures her that the less she knows, the safer she would be if captured by the Empire.

In "Gathering Forces", Ahsoka takes former Imperial Information Officer, Tseebo, into safe custody. Tseebo has half of the Empire's secrets downloaded into his cybernetic implants, information that could prove useful in the Rebels' fight against the Empire, despite that the whole download was an accident when Tseebo was actually looking for information on what happened to Ezra's parents.

When Kanan is captured by the Empire in "Call to Action", Ahsoka contacts Hera and dissuades from her attempt in rescuing Kanan. After reminding her that Kanan understands the risks and Ezra, the crew's remaining Jedi, is too important to risk losing. She informs her that the transmission they sent out had attracted a great deal of attention, not just from citizens, but also from the highest levels of the Empire. Ahsoka urges Hera to take her crew into hiding to avoid further risks that would jeopardize their mission. She later learns that the Ghost Cell went to rescue Kanan anyway and she sent Phoenix Squadron to save them.

Season Two
Ahsoka in deep thought.
Ahsoka appears in the one-hour second season premiere of Star Wars Rebels, at the Phoenix Home with Jun Sato while the rebels steal cargo from the Empire. After the Ghost Crew escapes Lothal after failing to save Maketh Tua, the Empire follows them and, led by Darth Vader, attacks the Phoenix Home.

Ahsoka joins the Ghost Crew to help fight off Darth Vader. When she senses the force is unusually strong with Darth Vader, she and Kanan try to figure out who he is. When Ezra tells them it is the Sith Lord the Ghost crew faced on Lothal, Ahsoka realizes Darth Vader is her former master, Anakin Skywalker. After sensing each other, Ahsoka screams and faints in Kanan's arms. Darth Vader tries to capture the rebels alive, wanting Ahsoka, but the Ghost crew manages to escape. After Ahsoka wakes up, she asks Ezra and Kanan what they know about Darth Vader. When Ezra asks if Ahsoka knows who he is, she lies saying she does not, but knows they'd be coming.

After the destruction of Phoenix Home, Ahsoka and the other Rebels try to find a suitable base for what remains of their fleet. Ahsoka brings up that she knows a great commander with experience in the Outer Rim that could help them find a base. She gives the Ghost crew an old Tactical Droid's head and tells them to search the Seelos system first before starting to leave. Ezra asks why she isn't coming with them, and Ahsoka tells him that she has other matters to deal with; the Sith Lord that attacked them. Before leaving Ahsoka tells Kanan that he must trust her friend. It is soon discovered that her friend is Clone Captain Rex. Even though Kanan doesn't trust him, Ezra constantly reminds him that Ahsoka does.

Upon regrouping with Ahsoka's Alderaan Cruiser, the Ghost crew reunites her with Rex. After exchanging a few words, Ahsoka embraces Rex. Ahsoka thanks the crew for trusting her friend, and though Kanan tells her it still isn't easy; Ahsoka simply tells him "Nothing worth doing, ever is".

Ahsoka against the Seventh Sister.
Ahsoka intercepts communications from Mustafar in an effort to learn more about Darth Vader. Information on him proves scarce, but she learns of a secondary mission given to the Inquisitors. After decoding a pair of coordinate sets, she asks Kanan and Ezra to investigate one of them and take Zeb along for help, while she went to investigate the other. She soon comes across a derelict transport ship and an injured woman named Darja, whose granddaughter Alora has been abducted by the Inquisitors. Ahsoka quickly makes her way to join Kanan's team on Takobo, where the Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister have defeated her friends. She engages the pair of Inquisitors in a lightsaber duel and easily defeats them through her mastery of the Force and superb lightsaber skills. Before she can capture or kill them, however, a squadron of Stormtroopers arrive and Ahsoka is forced to retreat, joining the others in escaping aboard the Phantom.

After Kanan and Ezra are attacked by the Inquisitors on Oosalan Mesa, they realize their presence is endangering the Rebellion's search for a base and meet with Ahsoka on the Ghost to discuss a plan of action. While waiting for them, she views a holocron of Anakin giving a demonstration in lightsaber combat, which Ezra also watches when he arrives. Remarking on his skills, he asks her what happened to him. Hesitant, she reveals she saw him once more when he was sent to rescue Chancellor Palpatine, but does not know what happened to him as the Jedi Purge unfolded. When Kanan arrives expressing his concerns, she mentions in difficult times she would have had asked Master Kenobi or Yoda for advice. Kanan reveals that they had communed with Yoda in the Lothal Jedi Temple, and chose to return there in the Phantom.

Ahsoka haunted by the fate of her former Master.
Ahsoka declines to raise the entrance to the temple, pointing out she is no longer a Jedi. Kanan and Ezra raise the temple from the ground, discovering a new door below the one they had entered before. Inside, Ahsoka, Kanan, and Ezra have their own visions. She is confronted by the spirit of Anakin, who expresses a twisted anger at her departure, calling her selfish and accusing her of abandoning him. He finally asks if she knew what he had become. Lashing out with her lightsaber, Ahsoka howls in agony, but she finally accepts the truth; her master became Darth Vader.

The Inquisitors arrive, but the visions in the temple took the shape of the Jedi Temple Guard and distract them, allowing Ahsoka and the Jedi to escape. As she flees, Ahsoka turns and sees a vision of Yoda, who waves at her. Smiling back, she turns and continues on her way back to the Phantom. On board, Ezra reveals he has spoken to Yoda and that he has been told to find Malachor. Ahsoka explains that Malachor is not a person, as Ezra assumed, but a place.

When Ezra, Kanan, and Ahsoka arrive at Malachor, Ahsoka explains the planet's history; thousands of years ago, Malachor was a Sith homeworld, the site of a great battle between the Jedi and Sith and that Jedi were taught not to go near the world. As they explore into the ruins of an old underground Sith temple, a place where they believe answers may be found in regards to the Sith's weaknesses, they are ambushed by a masked Inquisitor known as the Eighth Brother, whom they manage to capture after he separates Ezra from Kanan and Ahsoka. Upon interrogating him, they learn the Inquisitor is hunting a "Shadow". When Ezra and the companion he has activate the temple with a Sith holocron, this causes enough of a distraction that Ahsoka and Kanan's prisoner calls for backup, summoning the Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister. As a battle breaks out between the Inquisitors, Ahsoka and Kanan, Ezra and his companion join the fight, revealing "the shadow" to be an old enemy; Darth Maul, who is no longer a Sith lord and had survived the Clone Wars.

Ahsoka against her former master.
After driving off the Inquisitors, Ahsoka, having met Maul before, asks him why he was on Malachor. Maul responds that he too wishes to see the Empire fall, but for his own reasons, and that only by working together could they enter the temple. Saying that they had little time, Maul coerces them into reaching the top of the Sith temple, and helps to defeat the Inquistors, killing them. Ahsoka then sees Maul turn on them and blind Kanan. Maul then reveals his true plans: he desires to turn Ezra into his new apprentice and use the Holocron to activate an ancient Sith weapon to use against the Empire and anyone who stood in his way. Ahsoka leaves Maul to fight and be defeated by Kanan, and rushes to stop Ezra from inadvertently activating the weapon. Upon arriving, Ahsoka is greeted by the sight of Darth Vader, who states that their meeting was foretold to which she says she thought she knew who Vader was, only to declare him a different person altogether. Vader then claims that they did not need to be enemies and that he will spare her if she told him where the remaining Jedi were hiding, also saying that Anakin Skywalker was weak and that he had been destroyed. Ahsoka coldly retorts by saying there were no more Jedi, and that she, no longer being a Jedi, will avenge Anakin's "death". The two then engaged in battle, and though Ahsoka holds her own at first, Vader eventually overpowers her, throwing her off the edge of the temple. However, Ahsoka survives the fall and attacks Vader as he attempts to attack Ezra and Kanan for the Sith holocron. She knocks him down, slicing off part of Vader's mask and allowing Ezra and Kanan to escape. Ahsoka hears Vader call her name, and is horrified to see the eye and hear the partially distorted voice of Anakin Skywalker beneath the mask. Left without a doubt that Vader is her former master, Ahsoka states that she would not leave him, to which, after a brief moment of apparent hesitation, Vader replies that she will die. As the temple collapses and explodes around them, Ahsoka and Vader continue their duel. After the temple's destruction and Vader's departure, Ahsoka is last seen entering the ruins of the Sith Temple.

Season Four
After Ezra gains access to the Lothal Jedi Temple and finds himself in some kind of realm, he sees Ahsoka in a portal flashback of the duel she had with Vader in the Sith Temple on Malachor. The battle between the two continues as the temple starts to collapse around them. She creates a chasm that Vader will fall into, and before he strikes her down, she gets pulled through the portal by Ezra and into the realm. Ahsoka is confused on where she is and why Ezra looks different. Ezra fills her in about Kanan's demise and what has happened over the years since they last saw each other on Malachor at the Sith Temple.

Ahsoka, five years later.
Ezra then realizes if he was able to alter Ahsoka's fate, he could alter Kananâs as well. Ahsoka, however, convinces him to not try and save Kanan because if he does, he could alter the events that saved him and his friends. Just then, Emperor Palpatine attacks the two Jedi and attempts to abduct Ezra. Ahsoka saves him and they both take different paths, promising that she will find Ezra soon. She enters a portal, sending her back to Malachor with her convor, Morai. Wishing good luck to Ezra, she heads into the ruins of the Sith Temple.

Five years later, after the Rebellion's victory in the Battle of Endor that saw Anakin redeem himself by killing the Emperor at the cost of his own life, Ahsoka arrives on Lothal to pick up Sabine to begin their search for Ezra, who had gone missing when he and Grand Admiral Thrawn had been pulled into hyperspace by the Purrgil during Lothal's liberation some time after Ahsoka's last meeting with Ezra in the World Between Worlds.

The Mandalorian
Five more years pass and Ahsoka and Sabine have split up in their still-ongoing search for Ezra and Thrawn. Mandalorian Din Djarin is tasked with bringing "The Child" to the Jedi, and following a mission with Bo-Katan he is directed to where Ahsoka now resides, in the city of Calodan on the forest planet Corvus. She has made enemies with the cityâs corrupt magistrate, Morgan Elsbeth, who works for the Empire and repeatedly sends her troops to kill Ahsoka to no avail. Djarin and the Child arrive some time later and he is told by the magistrate to kill Ahsoka, and in exchange she will give him her staff made of pure beskar. Djarin and Ahsoka meet and briefly fight outside the city before Djarin addresses her by name and says Bo-Katan sent him, causing her to stop.

The three set up camp and the Child and Ahsoka communicate through the Force (as he cannot speak full sentences yet). Through this, Ahsoka reveals to Djarin that the Child's name is Grogu, and that he was taken from the Jedi Temple and hidden away after the end of the Clone Wars, after which he remembers very little. Ahsoka mentions that he reminds her of Yoda and she explains the Force to the Mandalorian, and they decide to let Grogu sleep.

The next morning, Ahsoka begins training Grogu, who proves uncooperative until Djarin assists him. Ahsoka refuses to train Grogu on the grounds that he is too attached to Djarin, making him vulnerable to his fears. Having seen this happen with Anakin becoming Vader, Ahsoka intends to avoid a repeat of Anakinâs path and says it is best to let Groguâs abilities fade. Djarin then mentions that he was sent by Elsbeth to kill Ahsoka but never agreed to anything. He offers to help her retake the town on the condition that she trains Grogu. They make a plan to free three prisoners and dethrone Elsbeth. Ahsoka enters town and overpowers several soldiers before personally meeting Elsbeth. She throws a piece of Dinâs shoulder armor onto the ground, as âproofâ that she killed him instead. Ahsoka then demands to know where Elsbethâs master is, so Elsbeth orders her men to kill her. Ahsoka escapes and Elsbeth orders for the three prisoners to be executed, but Djarin arrives and kills the executioners. Ahsoka continues to hide in the shadows and kill several soldiers. Din kills Elsbethâs hired assassin, while Ahsoka defeats Elsbeth and demands Thrawnâs location.

Djarin gets Grogu, planning to leave him with Ahsoka. However, the child has become extremely attached to Djarin, so Ahsoka still refuses to train him but offers an alternative: he may take him to Tython, where there is a Jedi temple. She tells Djarin to place Grogu on a seeing stone at the top of the mountain and from there he may choose his own path. Djarin and Grogu then depart on the Razor Crest.

Star Wars: Forces of Destiny
Ahsoka Tano in Star Wars: Forces of Destiny.
Ahsoka appears in the animated miniseries, Star Wars: Forces of Destiny, with Ashley Eckstein reprising her role. In "The Padawan Path", which takes place between The Clone Wars episodes "Hunt for Ziro" and "Heroes on Both Sides", Ahsoka is seen running through the streets of Coruscant, on her way to the ceremony where she will receive an extension to her padawan braid from Master Yoda. Along the way, Ahsoka stops to save a mother and her child from a malfunctioning droid. She easily disables it by slicing off one of its legs and drenching its circuits with water, and later arrives for the ceremony at the force-sensitive tree.

Ahsoka appears alongside Senator Amidala in "The Imposter Inside", where she helps with the Senator's arrangements for negotiations with the Arthurian delegates. The bounty hunter known as Cato Parasitti, disguised as one of the Senator's handmaidens, tries to disrupt the negotiations until her attempts to kill PadmÃ© are foiled by Ahsoka and PadmÃ©'s teamwork.

Printed Media
Ahsoka
Ahsoka appears as the main character in the young adult novel in October 11, 2016, Ahsoka, written by E.K. Johnston. The novel explains what happened to Ahsoka after the end of the Clone Wars, and before she re-appeared as the mysterious Rebel operative "Fulcrum" in Star Wars Rebels.

In the final days of the Clone Wars, approximately a year after she left the Jedi Order, Ahsoka discovered the whereabouts of the former Sith Lord Maul, who had taken over Mandalore again and gained leadership of Death Watch. She then contacted Anakin and Obi-Wan, requesting their help in confronting Maul. Shortly before establishing a siege to Mandalore, however, Anakin and Obi-Wan were called back to Coruscant to save Chancellor Palpatine, who had been abducted by General Grievous. Unable to use the help of her former masters, Ahsoka was given the possession of her old lightsabers, and the command of an army of Clone Troopers led by Rex. Unbeknownst to Ahsoka, this would be the last time she would ever see Anakin as a friend.

Ahsoka and her allies then laid siege to Mandalore. After engaging in a lightsaber duel with the former Sith, Ahsoka managed to lure Maul into a plaza where her comrades trapped him in a ray shield. However, all the efforts of Ahsoka and her allies were undone when Darth Sidious enacted Order 66, a devastating command that turned the clones against the Jedi and wiped out most of them, including Ahsoka's former mentor Plo Koon. As a result, the clone troopers under Ahsoka's command turned on her, with the exception of Rex, who had previously removed his inhibitor chip, an inorganic brain implant that compelled each clone trooper to comply with Order 66. As a result, Maul escaped once again, but Ahsoka and Rex were able to escape as well, after faking their own deaths, with Ahsoka leaving her lightsabers behind as evidence of her faked demise.

After fleeing Mandalore, Ahsoka went into the Outer Rim, eventually coming to the moon of Raada. Under the alias of Ashla, Ahsoka befriended Kaeden Larte and made a life for herself in the farming community. Unfortunately, Imperial forces under Jenneth Pilar soon targeted the moon for their own purposes (in secret, helping to grow supplies for the engineers constructing the Death Star), leading to an Imperial occupation. Ahsoka and her new friends set about forming a resistance movement, but some of the farmers took too aggressive of a stance and ended up in a battle with the Imperials. As a result, Ahsoka was forced to employ her Force powers during a confrontation, which alerted an Inquisitor called the Sixth Brother to her presence on Raada.

Ahsoka dueled the Inquisitor, defeating him and causing his lightsaber to explode, unintentionally killing him in the process. She then took the kyber crystals from his lightsaber and used them to craft a pair of white lightsabers. With the assistance of Senator Bail Organa, Ahsoka evacuated the citizens of Raada, and the two began organizing a formal rebellion against the Empire.

Trivia
Her re-appearance in Star Wars Rebels was teased by James Arnold Taylor at the 2014 Star Wars Weekends.
In Star Wars Rebels and The Mandalorian, Ahsoka has two lightsabers that share references to the early concept made by Ralph McQuarrie, such as the blades being white.
Rosario Dawson's casting as Ahsoka can be traced back to a tweet from 2017 when a fan said they wanted to see Dawson portray Ahsoka in live action, with Dawson herself then voicing her desire to play Ahsoka as well.
Ahsoka is the first known person to have changed the color of a lightsaber crystal, which she did to the red crystals of Sixth Brother by removing the taint of the dark side and imbuing the Light back into the crystals, turning them white.
Ahsoka is the first female Jedi to be a lead character in the canon continuity of the Star Wars universe. Although in the Star Wars Legends continuity there were other female Jedi that were created as lead characters before her, because she was introduced in the canon continuity, she is the first one that made her debut onscreen rather than in a novel, comic, or game.
Because she is one of the voices heard by Rey during the confrontation against Palpatine in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, many fans believed that this meant Ahsoka had died at some point before the events of the film. However, on Christmas Day of the same year, a few days after the theatrical release of the film, Dave Filoni posted on Twitter a drawing with Ahsoka and Gandalf (from The Lord of the Ring series), in which the wizard tells Ahsoka, "People thought I was dead too. Look how it turned out.", hinting that Ahsoka is still alive during the scene in The Rise of Skywalker.
During an interview a few months later, Dave Filoni talked about this tweet, saying that he was surprised by the fan reaction. He stated that the fans watch the films but don't take all the lessons and deal a lot in absolutes like the Sith. He explained that some of those voices are in fact of characters that we know are dead, but speaking with someone through the Force is something already seen between living characters in Star Wars, and mentioned as example Luke speaking through the Force with both Vader and Leia in The Empire Strikes Back.

Based on the way Ahoska describes Anakin's downfall in The Mandalorian because of his attachment implies that she ended up learning both of her former master's feelings towards PadmÃ© and that was what caused his downfall to the dark side.
