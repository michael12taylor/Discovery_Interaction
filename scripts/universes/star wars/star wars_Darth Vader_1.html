Background
Personality
After Anakin Skywalker finally embraced his inner darkness, the persona of Anakin ceased to exist, as the Darth Vader persona overtook him almost completely. Unlike most members of the Sith Order, Vader is not only capable of acknowledging his mistakes, but learning from them as well.

Vader became emotionally traumatized by the experience of the events on Mustafar. Vader is now terrifying, driven by rage, and his overconfidence has been further greatly amplified to the point of arrogance. However, after his defeat and mutilation on Mustafar at the hands of Obi-Wan Kenobi, he is no longer as arrogant and overconfident as he previously was. Although he eventually regained confidence in himself, it never came to the point of being outwardly arrogant or cocky.

Vader remains an impatient man, albeit to a far less extent, but generally presents himself as calm and level-headed. He rarely loses his temper and usually has good control over his emotions (something he was not able to do in his youth), but he has an extremely low tolerance for failure and any form of betrayal. Despite this, he is able to tolerate failure from his troops to a certain extent, although he becomes known for frequently killing his own men for even the slightest mistake. He also does not get along well at all with naval officers in the Imperial military. He has little to no tolerance for incompetence or for those who disrespect him for no clear reason, nearly choking Admiral Conan Antonio Motti to death when he disrespected Vader and challenged his powers of the Force. Vader telekinetically strangled Admiral Kendal Ozzel and Captain Lorth Needa for their incompetence. Many higher-ranking officers came to despise the Sith Lord and his "sorcerer's ways" for no clear reason.

Despite Vader's negative relationship with some higher-ranking officers in the military, he does get along reasonably well with the Stormtroopers because of his front line leadership. One reason Vader became popular with the troops that served under him is his willingness to fight in the front line, and not expect of anyone anything he was not willing to do himself.

As Supreme Commander within the ranks of the Imperial Army of the Galactic Empire, Vader is renowned for his leadership skills and admired by clones, middle/low-ranking officers, Sith, and politicians alike.

Despite what Vader's actions causes upon both himself and the galaxy, he apparently believes he is doing what is good for the galaxy, claiming not to feel regret. However, he actually secretly feels enormous shame and remorse for his actions, whether he wants to admit it or not. His feelings of guilt are so much that he develops a deep self-loathing and even nearly commits suicide at one point.

Vader is determined to never talk about his old life, wanting to distance himself from his painful past as best as possible. As a result, he detests anything that reminds him of his former-self, which he deems to be weak. It is for this reason that he showed no desire to restore the bond he once shared with his former apprentice and friend Ahsoka Tano, as she is a living memory of everything he once was, and in his own twisted way, he became angry at her for leaving him and the Jedi Order, something he perceived later on as a form of betrayal. Upon their fateful reunion, he did offer to spare her if she told him where the other lost Jedi were hiding, but cruelly resolved to kill her when she refused, and even when she found out he was indeed her former mentor and showed him compassion.

Due to Vader's former status as a slave, he has distress when the concept of slavery is brought up, despite the fact that the Empire made slavery legal again. He also can not return to his home planet Tatooine, as the planet is a painful reminder of him losing his mother, Shmi Skywalker. It was only after he found out about the existence of his son, Luke Skywalker, that Vader was able to muster the ability to return to Tatooine once more, and only because it was in search of information regarding his son.

Vader is cold, brutal, and ruthless towards his enemies, perfectly willing to terrorize, torture, and even murder them in cold-blood, although he does not take pleasure out of it. The exception to this might have been during his trip to Tatooine in search of information regarding his son, Luke Skywalker, during which he slaughtered an entire tribe of Tusken Raiders (much as he had as Anakin) either out of vengeance or pleasure for what they did to his mother.

Vader is seemingly unfailingly loyal to his master, being Sheev Palpatine the closest thing he has to a friend. However, in truth he secretly hates his master for deceiving him and ruining his life, even planning to overthrow him one day with his own apprentice. The only reason why Vader continued to serve Palpatine after losing his wife, was because the Emperor was all he had left of his former life as Anakin Skywalker and was the only one that would accept him. Ultimately, Vader is only truly loyal to the people he still cared about (like his son, Luke Skywalker), which is seen with him doing everything possible to protect his son from Palpatine.

Despite of these negative traits, Vader later proves that there was still good left in him. Upon discovering the existence of his son, Luke Skywalker, Vader became emotionally conflicted, unsure whether to continue serving his master or overthrow him with his son. He displayed a sense of compassion for Luke, revealing that some hint of him still had love for his family. This attachment ultimately led to his redemption.

Before the Battle of Endor had begun, Vader strongly believed that he was irredeemable and there was no good left in him. This belief was so strong that in a mental battle between his good and evil halves brought about after once being defeated by a powerful enemy. The evil Vader persona of his personality battled and destroyed the Anakin persona that represented his good side. However, when his son, Luke, was being tortured by Palpatine, he finally broke away from the dark side. At this point, Vader ceased to exist and Anakin returned in full force.

When Anakin sacrifices his life to save his son, before succumbing to the injuries he received from Palpatine, Anakin reconciled with Luke, and thanked his son for never giving up hope in saving him. He then died peacefully, becoming one with the Force.

Powers and Abilities
Powers
Power of the Force: Vader is immensely powerful and has an amazingly strong connection to the Force. As the Chosen One, Vader is stronger than any Force-user in existence. Thus, he is the most powerful Jedi and overall the most powerful Force-user in the history of the galaxy. According to Obi-Wan Kenobi, Vader's potential in the Force surpassed that of even Yoda and Sheev Palpatine at their peaks. His Force powers are rivaled by his son Luke Skywalker, but possibly by his daughter Leia Organa and by his grandson Ben Solo, at their peaks. However, after being burned alive on Mustafar and forced to become a cyborg, he apparently never reached his full potential, as the emotional and psychological trauma caused by his transformation greatly limited his ability to access and control certain aspects and powers of the Force. His injuries are such that he is only able to reach about 20% of his former strength. As example, due to his prosthetic arms and hands, he can't utilize or be immune to Force lightning. The life support systems keeping him alive, also making him incredibly vulnerable to such powers like Force lightning as without them he would perish (but he is able to block Force lightning with his lightsaber, giving him a fair measure of protection against this power so long as he is armed). Vader also heavily relies on the dark side of the Force to maintain his armor at peak efficiency. Despite these setbacks, Vader still became one of the most powerful Force-users in the history of the galaxy. Palpatine, the strongest Sith to ever existed, surpassed him due to his emotional and psychological trauma, and Vader's own son, Luke, rivaled Vader's Force powers at its full potential. It is likely if he had not turned into a cyborg, Vader would have reached his full potential, as Luke is a mirror version of what Vader could have become.
Telekinesis: Vader can telekinetically move objects or other individuals without physically touching them, and he utilizes it for offensive or defensive purposes. In one issue of Marvel Comics' Vader Down series, Vader was able to simultaneously fly his TIE Advanced and use his telekinetic abilities to destroy Rebel starfighters, taking out three squadrons of X-wings in this fashion. Additionally, in the sixth issue of Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith: The Chosen One, Vader was shown to efficiently and effortlessly repair his damaged armor through manipulating multiple tools and the armor itself using telekinesis, all while limbless and recovering from his wounds inside a bacta tank. In the eighth issue, he managed to easily levitate the pieces of Jocasta Nu's starfighter and rearrange them back into place after the ship had self destructed, revealing it as a Jedi craft and that she was on the planet, alerting the Imperials station there. He could also effortlessly maintain an air bubble at crushing depths on the watery world of Mon Cala using telekinesis to prevent the water pressure from crushing him as was revealed in the the third issue of Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith: Burning Seas.
Force Push: Vader can telekinetically send his opponents flying through the air, causing serious injury or temporarily incapacitating/knocking them unconscious, depending on how much power is unleashed. In the Lords of the Sith novel, Vader's was strong enough to send a large telekinetic pulse capable of ripping apart several Lyleks simultaneously, despite the fact that the creatures' carapaces were impervious to even heavy blaster fire.
Force Pull: Vader can telekinetically pull his opponents or objects towards him.
Force Repel: Vader can unleash a wave of pure Force energy that knocks back and repels anything within the power's blast radius or pushes multiple opponents simultaneously. He unleashed a telekinetic tremor that destroyed the medical chamber where he was first encased with his armor, while multiple objects and droids were simultaneously crushed, and Sidious was blasted against a wall.
Force Choke: Vader can telekinetically choke his opponents to either weaken, kill or intimidate them. He can also do this from a great distance simply by knowing the targets location relative to himself, as he choked Admiral Ozzel from several kilometers away on another ship while looking at him through a view screen. This is also one of his favorite moves.
Force Grip: Vader can telekinetically lift his opponents off the ground and into the air, sometimes by the neck, to immobilize them. His abilities also allows him to influence the movements of individuals, as demonstrated when he forced Ezra Bridger to raise his lightsaber towards his own neck while also pinning him against a wall. Additionally, he was able to freeze two Inquisitors in place before forcing them to activate their lightsabers, and fatally stab the other, all as punishment for their romantic entanglements with each other.
Force Stasis: Vader can telekinetically slow down or completely halt the motion of a target, holding them in place with a paralyzing grip. In Darth Vader 4: Vader, Part II, he managed to momentarily freeze the explosion generated by a grenade thrown at him by clone troopers, which, while straining, allowed him time to get out of its blast radius safely before he released it.
Force Levitation: Vader can telekinetically levitate himself or slow down his fall to the ground.
Force Crush: Vader can telekinetically crush objects or droids.
Force Throw: Vader can telekinetically objects and other individuals to be hurled toward a target at an astounding velocity. Vader used this power in his second confrontation against his son, Luke.
Force Barrier: Vader can create a barrier or wall of Force energy in front of or surrounding himself or his allies. He notably used this to shield himself from debris in Darth Vader 4: Vader, Part IV.
Saber Throw: Vader can telekinetically guide his lightsaber towards his opponents and return the weapon back to his hand, similar to a boomerang or shuriken.
Energy Absorption: Vader can dissipate concentrated energy such as blaster bolts with his bare hands, although it is difficult to do so. He notably used this ability on Cloud City to harmlessly absorb Han Solo's blasterfire with his hand before telekinetically disarming Han.
Force Deflection: Vader can telekinetically redirect incoming attacks such as blaster bolts, with or without his lightsaber, although it is difficult to do so. By the time of the Death Star's creation, he became able to temporarily cause blaster bolts to bounce off his body and back towards his opponents, as he did during his slaughter of a group of rebels that barely managed to get the plans for the superweapon onboard Leia's blockade runner.
Telepathy: Vader can telepathically communicate with other individuals over small or vast distances, especially his son, Luke Skywalker. This was shown in a deleted scene of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, in which he managed to communicate with Luke.
Mind Probe: Vader can telepathically sense and sift through the thoughts and memories of other sentient beings. This allowed him to sense the thoughts and feelings of Luke when he was emotionally vulnerable, leading to him realizing that Luke had a sister, Leia Organa.
Mind Trick: Vader can communicate or control the minds of other sentient beings, except for individuals with indomitable wills. However, he can combine this power with other Force-users to bypass the said indomitable will.
Taming Beasts: Vader can control the minds of animals. As seen in Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith: Burning Seas- Part 3, in his attack on Mon Cala to hunt the Jedi Farren Barr, Vader used the Force to tame a large squid. He convinced it to not eat him, bring him his lost lightsaber, and then carry him back to the surface depths.
Force Vision: Vader can see visions of the past, present, and future. However, like all Force-users, his visions are not always clear or sometimes they happen without warning.
Force Sense: Vader can sense another sentient being's emotions, the future, ripples in the Force caused by momentous or traumatic events, impending danger, and the presence of other light or dark side Force-users. His senses are so powerful that he was able to sense the presence of his former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi on the first Death Star, besides sensing the presence of his son Luke on more than one occasion.
Force Stealth: Vader can conceal his presence from other Force-users.
Focused Rage: Vader can channel his anger to amplify his strength, durability, endurance, speed, ferocity, aggression and the potency of his combat prowess/attacks.
Force Jump: Vader can jump or leap great distances, although he rarely uses this power due to the limits of his suit and heavy cybernetics.
Force Dash: Vader can move at amazing speeds.
Fold Space: Vader can transport anything across space. He is only able to perform such a feat with the help of a cosmic gateway made within his castle.
Teleportation:  Vader can open a wormhole, but due to being a cyborg and all of his Force Abilities to be limited, it is immensely difficult and painful to do so. Such portal is generated by his own castle, which is designed to harness the power of the dark side on Mustafar.
Telekinesis: Vader can telekinetically move objects or other individuals without physically touching them, and he utilizes it for offensive or defensive purposes. In one issue of Marvel Comics' Vader Down series, Vader was able to simultaneously fly his TIE Advanced and use his telekinetic abilities to destroy Rebel starfighters, taking out three squadrons of X-wings in this fashion.

Advanced Strength: Vader utilizes his Force powers to amplify his physical strength, making him physically stronger than most, if not all other sentient beings. His cybernetic enhancements also allow him additional strength to overpower other individuals with far greater ease.
Cybernetic Enhancements: Vader utilizes his cybernetic enhancements in combat, giving him greater strength to easily subdue, restrain, and overpower his opponents. He can effortlessly lift humans off the ground with one hand while holding them by the neck, crush bones in his fist, or throw people across rooms. Despite his great strength, physically lighter opponents can still block him in a lightsaber duel, such as Kanan Jarrus, Ezra Bridger, Ahsoka Tano, and even his son, Luke Skywalker respectively. His cybernetic enhancements are enough to allow him to even stand against the might of a Wookiee and Trandoshan respectively.

Abilities
Master Lightsaber Duelist: Vader is a highly skilled lightsaber duelist and one of the deadliest in the history of the galaxy, rivaled by his son, Luke Skywalker. According to Obi-Wan Kenobi, Vader's lightsaber combat skills surpassed that of even Yoda and Sheev Palpatine. However, after being burned alive on Mustafar and forced to become a cyborg, he apparently never reached his full potential, as his armored suit greatly limited his mobility. Despite this, Vader still became a master lightsaber duelist. He is specialized in using his lightsaber combat skills, weight, endurance, and sheer brute strength to overwhelm his opponents into confusion or exhaustion, such as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka Tano, and Luke Skywalker. Vader also regained some of his old agility and his blade work became brutally effective. Vader's technique and fighting style is a combination of brute strength and lethal precision, as his armor hampered some of his movement and he needed to constantly protect the control panel on his chest from attack, where he would otherwise be vulnerable to it. The full extent of his lightsaber combat skills is demonstrated during his duel with Ahsoka. However, as seen in "A World Between Worlds", if a future version of Ezra had not rescued Ahsoka from Vader, he would have striked her down. His lightsaber combat skills are such that he is extremely confident in his abilities. During the events portrayed in the issues of the Marvel Comics story Vader Down, Vader was able to single-handedly take on a platoon of three squadrons of X-wing fighters, several Y-wing fighters, and hundreds of Rebel soldiers that surrounded him on the planet of Vrogas Vas, saying that despite their greater numbers, all he was surrounded by was fear and dead men before slaughtering them all with terrifying ease. In a lightsaber duel during the same battle, he also is able to kill Karbin, the Mon Calamari cyborg commander for the Empire and Vader's intended replacement, albeit with some assistance from Dr. Aphra.

Master Pilot: Even before Vader's fall to the dark side, he was praised as the most skilled star-pilot in the history of the galaxy, a reputation he lived up to when he single-handedly almost destroyed Phoenix Squadron in his TIE Advanced, easily out-flying their entire fleet and forcing their command to abandon ship. Vader's piloting skills were rivaled only by his son, Luke Skywalker.
Expert Hand-To-Hand Combatant: Vader is an extremely skilled hand-to-hand combatant, although he normally uses his brute strength against others, allowing him to defeat others with less of a need for skill.
Expert Marksman: Although rarely seen, Vader is highly skilled in the use of blaster pistols.
Master Engineer: Even before Vader's fall to the dark side, he is amazingly skilled in engineering, he can personally repair starships to maintain his skill. Repairing such machinery and vehicles also act as a form of meditation for Vader, allowing him to focus and clear his mind.
Genius-Level Intellect/Master Tactician/Leader: Even before Vader's fall to the dark side, he was amazingly intelligent and wise; his intellect and wisdom rivaled that of even Yoda, Sheev Palpatine, Qui-Gon Jinn, and Luke Skywalker. As the Supreme Commander of the Imperial Military and a member of the Imperial High Command, Vader is a highly skilled tactician and a very capable leader. Due to his experience from the Clone Wars, he has an excellent reputation of never being defeated, he can also use his opponents own tactics against them. Furthermore, Vader often uses his environment to his advantage, using the terrain against his opponents by using whatever is at his disposal, such as throwing shrapnel and wreckage at his foes. In Vader Down, he used shrapnel and wreckage from his own TIE Advanced to decimate his enemies on Vrogas Vas in conjunction with his Force skills and his lightsaber.
Intimidation: As an immensely powerful Force-user, Vader commends an intimidating presence to the point where many of his allies and enemies alike across the galaxy fear him, even exceptionally powerful Force-users such as Yoda, Sheev Palpatine, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka Tano, the Grand Inquisitor, the Fifth Brother, Kanan Jarrus, and Ezra Bridger are terrified of him, as Vader is one of the most, if not the most feared Sith in the entire galaxy.
Multilingual: Mostly due to Vader's interactions as Anakin Skywalker, he is capable of fluently speaking Basic, Huttese, Bith, and Sith tongue.
Weapons and Equipment
Lightsabers
Vader's valued weapon and possession is his blue, later red-bladed lightsabers. He has only had two lightsabers.

Jedi Lightsaber: Though technically the second lightsaber Vader owned after the first was destroyed, he built this blue-bladed lightsaber and used it throughout the Clone Wars. He used this weapon through Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, even after falling to the dark side and becoming a Sith Lord. He lost this weapon to Obi-Wan when he was heavily mutilated on Mustafar, leading to the latter keeping it for nineteen years after. Luke Skywalker was given this weapon after meeting Obi-Wan and used it while part of the Rebel Alliance. Luke had no proper training and was forced to improvise his attacks with it. He lost it when his father cut his hand during their duel, causing the lightsaber to fall down Cloud City's airshafts. It then resurfaced and ended up in the hands of Maz Kanata. Maz offered the lightsaber to Rey when it called to her, but after Rey refused it, she gives it to Finn. On Starkiller Base, Finn, and then Rey, both fought Kylo Ren with it. It was later presented to Luke by Rey as a sign he was needed once again, only for Luke to reject it. Afterwards, Rey used it as her own. On the Supremacy, it was used by Kylo to kill his own master before he returned it to Rey, so she could fight the Praetorian Guards. It was ultimately destroyed in a struggle between Rey and Kylo over ownership of the lightsaber, but it later repaired by Rey through the use of Force healing. She continued to use the lightsaber as her own, and almost burned it after discovering to be Palpatine's grandaughter, only to be stopped by Luke's Force spirit, who catches it. Rey uses the lightsaber, along with Leia's lightsaber to finally kill the resurrected Palpatine by deflecting his Force lightning back at him. After Palpatine's death, Rey buried both lightsabers at the Lars homestead on Tatooine, having built her own lightsaber.
Sith Lightsaber: Vader had built a red-bladed lightsaber, a short time after he became a cyborg. As was common to all Sith lightsabers, it was a red-bladed lightsaber. As was traditional with all Sith, Darth Vader's lightsaber crystal was made using the corrupted kyber crystal taken from a Jedi's lightsaber, and turned red through infection with the dark side of the Force. The kyber crystal he claimed once belonged to Jedi Master Kirak Infil'a, whom Vader killed in single combat shortly after becoming a Sith. Vader would also originally use Infil'a's hilt for his lightsaber, but when it was destroyed in a fight with bounty hunters, Vader rebuilt his weapon into the hilt that was a twisted version of his very first lightsaber from when he had been a Jedi Padawan. It would remain in his possession until his final duel against his son, Luke Skywalker and was presumably destroyed when the second Death Star was destroyed. However, the post-empire dark side fanatical group known as the Acolytes of the Beyond purchased what they believed to be Vader's lightsaber from a dealer on the planet Taris named Ooblamon, hoping to reunite the weapon with its master in death by destroying it. It remains unknown if the artifact in question actually was Vader's lightsaber or not, as not even the seller was certain of its authenticity. What became of this supposed "lightsaber" is also unknown.
Armor
Sith Armor: Vader's most important piece of equipment in his arsenal alongside his lightsaber was his armor. The characteristic armor also functions as Vader's life support suit, as without it, Vader can not move or even breathe. Vader also, on Palpatine's suggestion, customized his armor to suit his life as a Sith and to suit his needs, combat style, and personal preferences. Though he initially hated the armor for its encumbering nature, Vader grew to embrace how it isolated him from everyone and everything around him, allowing him to become a pure vessel of the dark side of Force. The armor contains a breathing apparatus within to pump purified air through Vader's damaged lungs, as well as a control panel on his chest to modulate the armor's functions that gave him proper amounts of nutrients and medicine to maintain his body. His armor allows him to walk without added protection on the icy planet of Hoth and survive in almost any environment or condition such as in the vacuum of space or on worlds with low amounts of oxygen. It even allows him to breathe underwater, though if Vader sinks too deep, he would be at risk from the crushing water pressure at greater depths. In addition to its function, Vader's armor, especially his helmet, gives him a frightening appearance. The helmet is undoubtedly the most important part of his armor, for the neural needles within allow him to use the armor and move, albeit painfully. Without those needles connecting to his skull and spine, Vader is utterly helpless and unable to survive outside of a bacta tank. Vader's armor has ten protective layers, making him highly resistant to damage and his boots have magnetic clamps within to allow him to stick to metal surfaces. In addition to this, the four prosthetic limbs he has as a result of his injuries on Mustafar make him stronger and taller than many other beings. But for all these strengths, Vader's armor is not without weaknesses or setbacks. Among these, Vader is no longer subject to the great agility he once had as Anakin Skywalker. Furthermore, his armor slows down some of his movements and he is forced to readjust his fighting style accordingly, instead becoming more tactical, conservative and precise without sacrificing strength. Another weakness is his need to continually meditate on the dark side of the Force to keep the armor fully functional and at peak efficiency. Lastly, the suit prevents him from being immune to or conjuring Force lightning, making him particularly vulnerable to that power, eventually resulting in his death at Palpatine's hands when he killed the Emperor to save his son, Luke. After his death, Luke ceremonially burned Vader's armor on the moon of Endor to rid the galaxy of the last traces of the evil that Vader had left. The only thing to remain, the burned and melted helmet, eventually was found by none other than Vader's grandson, Kylo Ren, who took the helmet and kept it on a table filled with the ashes of his slain enemies. Kylo would often try to speak to it as seen when he felt the pull of the light side of the Force, which made him want to receive his grandfather's guidance. Kylo also modeled his own helmet based on its design as part of his quest on the dark side to become as powerful as the late Sith Lord. Eventually, it was destroyed during a confrontation between Kylo and Rey through their Force-bond, in which they both accidentally hit the helmet with their lightsabers.
