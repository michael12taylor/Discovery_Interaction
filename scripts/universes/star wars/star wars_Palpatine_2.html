<html><p>In season six, as both Palpatine and Sidious, he goes to lengths to conceal his plan's full nature from the Jedi by silencing Clone Trooper Fives from learning of Order 66, and having Dooku wipe out anything tied to the former Jedi Master's connection to the conspiracy. In the season 7 episode "Shattered", both Ahsoka and Maul have visions of Palpatine, Anakin Skywalker, and Mace Windu, shortly before Rex receives a hologram from Sidious telling the clones to "Execute Order 66" in order to take out Ahsoka as an enemy of the Republic.

Star Wars Rebels
In the first season, Emperor Palpatine makes a brief appearance on the Holonet broadcast in the episode "Empire Day", but makes a vocal appearance in the second season premiere episode and television movie "The Siege of Lothal". In the latter, the Emperor is voiced by Sam Witwer, who originally provided both the voices of Emperor Palpatine and Galen Marek/Starkiller (Darth Vader's apprentice) in the 2008 video game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed and its sequel. For the fourth and final season of Rebels, McDiarmid returned to provide the Emperor's voice instead, as well as subsequently re-recorded Witwer's dialogue from the second season premiere.

In the episodes "Wolves and a Door", Emperor Palpatine appears as a hologram overseeing the excavation of the Lothal Jedi Temple, which contains a portal to a separate dimension of the Force outside of space and time, which Palpatine considers a 'conduit between the living and the dead' that could give him unrivaled power of the Force itself if he can access it. In "A World Between Worlds", shortly after Ezra Bridger reaches through time and space to rescue Ahsoka Tano from Vader, Palpatine sets up a portal through the ceremonial chamber in the tower at the Works in Coruscant that he use the Sith Alchemy to open the portal to the world between worlds where Ezra and Ahsoka are. Using the fire energy power against them, Palpatine caught Ezra's leg and pulling him while trying to get through the portal but stopped by Ahsoka cut the fiery lasso. He then tried again but failed to catch Ahsoka and Ezra that they made it through the portal back to their world, thus denying the Emperor full power. 

Palpatine later appeared in the series finale "Family Reunion - and Farewell" via hologram that presented his old self, where he tried to trick Ezra, but failed. As his hologram flickered to show his true self, Palpatine commands his Royal Guards to kill Ezra, though Ezra manages to defeat them and escape.

Trivia
Palpatine/Darth Sidious is often considered as one of the most evil movie villains ever created as he is mostly known for being the most ruthless or sinister in the Star Wars universe, being the mastermind behind most of the series' events.
Since the initial theatrical run of Return of the Jedi, Sidious has become a symbol of evil and sinister deception in popular culture. People have compared Palpatine's corrupt leadership to many dictators throughout history and his appearance to that of Benedict Arnold.

The film historian Robin Wood has compared Sidious' appearance to that of the Evil Queen's witch form in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Coincidentally, both of their disfigured appearances had some relation to lightning that they summoned (the Queen added lightning to a potion as part of an ingredient to fashion a disguise for herself and Sidious' body ended up disfigured as a direct result of Mace Windu redirecting his Force Lightning back at Sidious when he attempted to blast him with it, although it was heavily implied with the latter, at least in the old Expanded Universe, that the disfigurements were actually his true form being exposed).
Contrary to popular belief, neither of the names "Palpatine" or "Sidious" was not referred to by name until The Phantom Menace. His name originated from supplementary materials such as the visual dictionary for the original trilogy, the script, and the novelizations.
During production of Revenge of the Sith, George Lucas decided to shoot new footage for The Empire Strikes Back to create continuity between the prequels and original trilogy. Thus, in the 2004 DVD release of the films, the original version of the Emperor was replaced by actor Ian McDiarmid, who portrayed Palpatine in the other films. The dialogue between the Emperor and Darth Vader was revised, such as "the offspring of Anakin Skywalker" rather than saying Luke's name.
For the Star Wars: The Clone Wars film and subsequent TV show, Palpatine/Sidious was voiced by veteran actor Ian Abercrombie. Abercrombie passed away on January 26, 2012, leading to the legendary actor Tim Curry replacing him in the final seconds of "The Lawless" as well as the remaining episodes of Star Wars: The Clone Wars series, for which he was credited, beginning the fifth season finale "The Wrong Jedi". In the season 7 episode "Shattered", Ian McDiarmand voices Sidious through an archival recording from Revenge of the Sith telling "Execute Order 66" to Rex.
For Star Wars Rebels, while being mentioned in the series, Palpatine debuts in the second season premiere episode "The Siege of Lothal" with the Emperor voiced by Sam Witwer, who had previously voiced the character in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. In 2019, McDiarmid subsequently re-recorded Witwer's dialogue from the second season premiere.
In addition, Ian McDiarmid voiced him for Season 4, marking the first time he's portrayed the character in a Star Wars production since Revenge of the Sith, as well as the first time he's portrayed the character in a non-film appearance. He is also the seventh Star Wars actor to reprise a role they portrayed in the films in Rebels, after Darth Vader, C-3PO, Yoda, Lando Calrissian, Saw Gerrera, and Mon Mothma.

According to the series creator of Star Wars Rebels, Dave Filoni, the events of Rogue One and A New Hope happen shortly after the series finale episode "Family Reunion - and Farewell", thus refocusing Palpatine's attention from Ezra and Lothal's liberation to the Rebel Alliance and Luke Skywalker.
Sidious' primary inspiration in the Prequels had been former President of the United States Richard Milhous Nixon.
The Emperor uses a cane because he pretends to be weak, not because he needs it.
While no explicit explanation is given in The Rise of Skywalker to how he managed to cheat death in Return of the Jedi, he quotes the phrase "the dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural" when he appears onscreen for the first time, implying that he used unknown Force powers to resurrect himself at some point before the events of The Force Awakens.
It was later revealed by the film's novelization and interviews with Ian McDiarmid himself that the Emperor used an undead clone of his own body to transfer his consciousness into using technology and the dark side of the Force.
One of the failed clones that Palpatine created to try and achieve immortality in this way became Rey's father.
These aforementioned cloning attempts are similar to the Legends Continuity Star Wars comics Dark Empire, in which Sidious used an endless supply of clones of himself to achieve immortality.

These aforementioned cloning attempts are similar to the Legends Continuity Star Wars comics Dark Empire, in which Sidious used an endless supply of clones of himself to achieve immortality.
In The Rise of Skywalker novelization, it is revealed that Palpatine once attempted to create the dyad connection with Anakin Skywalker to gain more power, and before that Sidious' master also had tried to create one with him. However, as it was just a pale imitation of the original one, these attempts failed. Because Palpatine spent years searching for this power, he becomes really surprised and triumphant upon finding out that Rey and Ben are a real dyad in the Force.
Like his former pawn, the bounty hunter and the original host of clone troopers, Jango Fett, who had an unaltered clone as a "son", Emperor Palpatine also considered his non-force sensitive and non-identical clone as his "son".
Palpatine's actions during the years after returned from the dead caused the corruption of the heir of the Skywalker family, Ben Solo, besides causing the mistrust within the family and their separation. This is similar to what happens in Revenge of the Sith, but it goes even further because, by the end of The Rise of Skywalker, Palpatine's actions culminate in the elimination of the entire Skywalker bloodline. With this, despite having failed in his plan to bring back the Sith and return to power, he succeeded in the other main goal he had upon being revived: taking revenge on the Skywalkers for his first death.
The Emperor's defeat and death at the hands of Vader was referenced in Toy Story 3, where Big Baby picked up Lotso after one abuse too many and threw him in the dumpster. At the time the movie was released, Disney had not acquired the rights to Star Wars yet, though many of the Disney/Pixar films, including all of the Toy Story films, have included references to aspects of the Star Wars franchise.
Star Wars Resistance is the only Star Wars TV series that the Emperor Palpatine does not make an appearance.
