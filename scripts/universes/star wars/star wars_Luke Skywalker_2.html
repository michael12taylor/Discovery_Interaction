<html><p>Vader then takes Luke to see the Emperor in his throne room on the second Death Star. When they arrive, the Emperor orders his guards to leave, and he and Luke begin to talk. Eventually, the Emperor shows Luke that he has set up the Rebels, and they are prepared for the attack. He makes Luke watch his friends be killed trying to destroy the second Death Star. He gives Luke the opportunity to take his lightsaber and kill him, but Luke refuses. With the Emperor continuously taunting him, Luke gives in and uses the Force to take his lightsaber; but as he is about to strike, Vader blocks the blow with his own lightsaber, and they duel once again as the Emperor cackles viciously.

At one point, Luke jumps onto a high balcony, and when he refuses to give in to the dark side, Vader throws his lightsaber at the balcony, causing Luke to lose his balance and fall off. Still refusing to fight Vader, Luke hides in the darkness, and Vader tries to anger him into coming out. It is when Vader says that if Luke does not turn he would try to turn Leia instead, that Luke comes out and begins to attack Vader in a fury at the threat of his twin sister joining the Sith. Luke has Vader cornered at a balcony, where he cuts off his dueling hand in the same manner as Vader did to him in the previous film. The Emperor wants Luke to kill Vader, but after coming to his senses and realizing he is about to follow his father down the path of the dark side, Luke refuses, deactivating his lightsaber and tossing it aside, saying he is a Jedi like his father before him. The Emperor, who is outraged, shoots lightning out of his hands, trying to kill Luke, but when Vader sees Luke in pain, he grabs the Emperor and tosses him down a vast pit, thus killing him and fulfilling the Chosen One prophecy as he destroys the Sith and becomes Anakin Skywalker again, avenging Padm√© and his past sins. Luke brings the mortally wounded Vader back to a ship, and wants to bring him to Endor, but Vader asks Luke to take off his mask so he can look at his son with his own two eyes. Luke does so and sees a scarred, pale white face that has not seen daylight for years since his duel on Mustafar with Obi-Wan. Luke silently cries as Anakin passes away, and he gets on a shuttle and leaves with his father's body just as Lando destroys the second Death Star.

Back on Endor, there is a celebration in honor of the defeat of the Empire, which Luke joins after lighting a funeral pyre for his father. While at the party, Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Anakin. They all smile as they look at Luke, and he smiles back.

Star Wars: The Force Awakens
The elderly Luke Skywalker in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
Initially, Luke does not make a physical appearance for almost the entire film. However, he is mentioned by his old friend and brother-in-law Han Solo and several others, sometime after the Battle of Endor and the Battle of Jakku, Luke became a Jedi Master and tried to establish a New Jedi Order by training a new generation of Jedi Knights, the first of Luke's students was his nephew Ben Solo and several other Force-users. Unfortunately, his nephew fall to the dark side, as Snoke preyed on Ben's internal conflict. The Jedi Temple where he was training the new generation of Jedi was destroyed during the same night Ben turned to the dark side. Ben would follow Snoke as his new master and later join the Knights of Ren, becoming known as Kylo Ren.

Luke managed to survive and escape the Jedi Temple's destruction, but this devastating tragedy greatly delayed his plan to restore the Jedi Order to its former glory. In the aftermath, Luke was deeply grieved and wracked with guilt, blaming himself for his students' deaths and Ben's turn to the dark side. Luke then mysteriously disappeared, vanishing into self-imposed exile as he chose to seek out the First Jedi Temple.

The First Order, under the orders of Snoke, are to find and kill Luke, as Snoke knows that as long as Luke is alive, a new generation of Jedi Knights can rise again. Luke finally makes a physical appearance at the end of the film, but does not speak; Luke is found on the planet Ahch-To, which is dotted with islands, by the Force-sensitive scavenger Rey, and his friends R2-D2 and Chewbacca. Rey presents Luke with his father's lightsaber, showing the elderly Jedi Master that he is needed once more and that he stands as the last hope in the galaxy.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi
Luke, after a brief look at his father's second lightsaber, tossed it away and left the Plateu, but was followed by Rey, who wanted him to train her and aid in defeating the First Order. Luke blatantly refused to train Rey in the ways of the Jedi or help the Resistance, declaring that the Jedi Order needed to end with him. A persistent Rey held hope that the legendary Jedi Master would teach her and refused to leave Ahch-To, even after learning from Chewbacca that Han was dead (which he did not know before, due to cutting himself from the Force) it was only through encouragement from R2-D2 that Luke began to train Rey. But in her first lessons, Rey allowed the dark side in and Luke refused to teach her further.

While communicating with Kylo Ren through their Force-bond, Rey learned that Luke had tried to kill his nephew in his sleep. After Luke discovered Rey and Kylo touching hands and intently staring each other inside a hut, he became furious and ordered Rey to leave the island. Rey confronted and dueled Luke about the truth of Ben Solo's turn to the dark side, and he admitted that he was tempted to kill his nephew after discovering he had been seduced by the dark side. This caused Ben to wake up and try to fight him with his lightsaber before destroying the hut, burying him beneath it. As Luke woke up to find his Jedi Temple burning, he believed that Ben destroyed the new Jedi Order and took half of his apprentices with him. Believing himself responsible for Ben's fall, Luke came searching for Ahch-To so that he could die and end the Jedi Order with him.

After knowing the truth, Rey told Luke that he was wrong when he thought that Ben had already chosen the dark side as he sensed the darkness in him while he was sleeping, and that she felt the conflict within Kylo when they touched hands. Rey tried to convince Luke that Kylo Ren could be turned and that she would try to bring Ben back to the light. Luke disagreed and told her that this would not end as she thought. Rey then offered his father's saber to him again as one last attempt to invite him to fight with the Resistance. Luke refused the lightsaber again, causing Rey to declare that Ben Solo was the last hope before leaving the island to meet Kylo Ren.

As Rey left Ahch-To, Luke attempted to destroy the tree that had the original sacred Jedi texts. But before he did it, Yoda's Force spirit destroyed the tree with a lightning bolt. Yoda tried to advise Luke to accept his past mistakes to become a better teacher for Rey. Inspired by Yoda's words, Luke Force projected himself to the planet Crait to distract Ben and the First Order long enough for what remained of the Resistance to escape on the Millennium Falcon. Luke toyed with Ben before revealing himself to be a projection and proclaimed that he would haunt Ben and that he would not be the last Jedi, before disappearing. Exhausted, Luke climbed back atop the meditation rock, gazed at the binary sunset, and finally at peace, passed away and became one with the Force.

Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker
Luke comes back as a Force spirit to continue mentoring Rey in her battle against the Sith and the First Order. After her duel with Kylo Ren on the ruins of the second Death Star and Leia's death, Luke appears to Rey when she throws the Skywalker saber at the fire that is burning Kylo's TIE whisper. Luke encourages her to continue to fight instead of exiling herself on Ahch-To as he did before. He admits that he was wrong in isolating himself and tells her to confront her fears. He then gives Rey Leia's lightsaber and his old T-65B X-wing Red Five so she can get to Exegol to face Emperor Palpatine. At the end of the film, he and Leia are seen as Force spirits on Tatooine watching over Rey.

Video games
Disney Infinity
Luke Skywalker appeared in Disney Infinity's third installment as a playable character. He is playable in the Rise Against the Empire Play Set, and can also be used in the Twilight of the Republic and The Force Awakens play sets if the player collects his champion coin in each play set. Like all the other characters, he is playable in the Toy Box 3.0. In his skill tree, his special move is his Force Dash.

In the Rise Against the Empire Play Set, which is an alternate storyline of the Original Trilogy, he escapes the Death Star with Leia, Han, and Chewie, following C-3PO and R2-D2 in an escape pod that heads to Tatooine. As soon as they land, they travel to Ben's house, where they tell Ben that R2-D2 has the plans to defeat the Empire, and that they must send R2-D2 to Alderaan. Before they leave, Ben shows Luke the lightsaber that Anakin used, telling him that Vader killed his father. Eventually, the group get enough credit to buy the Millennium Falcon from Jabba the Hutt, and begin to search for Alderaan. However, when they get to its spot, they find that it had already been destroyed by the Death Star, and then the Millennium Falcon gets sucked in by the Death Star's tractor beam. While Ben goes to find Vader, Luke travels around the Death Star with Han, Leia, and Chewie to deactivate the tractor beam's power supplies. When they get back to the Millennium Falcon, an army of stormtroopers is waiting. After the stormtroopers are defeated, they notice Ben in a lightsaber duel with Vader. Ben is killed by Vader, just before Luke leaves with the others, feeling deeply saddened by Ben's death. With the plans, Luke and the others manage to destroy the Death Star.

Afterwards, they head to Hoth to settle in the base. Soon, the Empire finds them, using AT-AT Walkers to attack them. Successfully, Luke and the others take the AT-ATs down before they can destroy the base. After taking the soldiers to the evacuation point, Vader arrives along with an army of stormtroopers, revealing to Luke that he is his father. Shocked by this, Luke announces that he will never join the dark side, just before he leaves with Han, Leia, C-3PO, and R2-D2 on the Millennium Falcon to go to Endor to destroy a shield generator that is shielding a second Death Star. After the shield is down, Luke travels to the second Death Star to face Vader, while Leia, Han, and Chewie join him. The moment they meet Vader, they get into a battle with him. Palpatine soon attempts to kill Luke with his powers, while holding his friends back, but Vader reforms and throws Palpatine into the pit. Before Vader dies, he admits to Luke that he was right about that there was some good in him. The group then get into the Millennium Falcon and work together to destroy the second Death Star, with their celebration taking place on Endor.

Trivia
Robby Benson auditioned to play Luke, but lost this role to Mark Hamill.
In 2008, the character was selected by Empire magazine as the 54th greatest movie character of all time.
Luke‚Äôs last name was originally ‚ÄúStarkiller‚Äù. This was the inspiration for both Darth Vader‚Äôs apprentice Starkiller in the non-canon video game The Force Unleashed and Starkiller Base in the sequel trilogy. According to Mark Hamill, the name change came late enough in filming that the scene of Luke saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Luke Skywalker, I‚Äôm here to rescue you‚Äù had to be reshot.
Luke is listed at number 14, of the Fandomania.com 100 Greatest Fictional Characters.
In A New Hope, Luke's line "I can't see a thing in this helmet" was not scripted. Mark Hamill said this to Harrison Ford when he thought the cameras had stopped rolling, but the filmmakers decided to leave the line in.
In the (now non-canon) Star Wars Expanded Universe/Legends, Luke had a wife named Mara Jade and a son named Ben Skywalker.
In the Darkwing Duck episode Twin Beaks, Darkwing Duck refered to Launchpad McQuack as Duck Skywalker.
