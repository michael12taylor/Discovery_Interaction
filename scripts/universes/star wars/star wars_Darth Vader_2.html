<html><p>Anakin found out that Palpatine is Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord who manipulated events regarding the Clone Wars to gain power, but was still led to believe the Jedi were traitors to the Republic. When Palpatine promised him a way to save his pregnant wife Padmé, Anakin turned to the dark side to become Sidious' new apprentice and was rechristened as Darth Vader. After slaughtering all the Jedi in the Jedi Temple, including the younglings, as part of the Great Jedi Purge, Vader was sent by Sidious to the Mustafar system, where he eliminated Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray and the other Separatist leaders in equally quick order, saving Gunray for last due to the numerous attempts the Viceroy had made on Padmé's life.

Darth Vader beside his master.
Outside, Vader cried tears of remorse for his vile deeds but believed them to be for the greater good. Afterwards, the Sith apprentice reported his success to his master through a hologram and the latter congratulated him. Soon he spotted a ship, Vader is confronted by Padmé who knows of his actions and implored to leave the dark side and raise their child. However, he showed he was too corrupted from his powers and sought to claim power of the new Emperor. Padmé pleaded to him but Vader spotted his former master, Obi-Wan Kenobi who snuck aboard her ship. When he believes Padmé has brought Obi-Wan to kill him, he Force chokes the begging Padmé and engages Obi-Wan in a ferocious lightsaber duel after he refused to side with him. The duel sees the destruction of the Separatist holdout they are in. Despite his vigorous efforts, Vader ultimately loses the fight, as well as his legs and left arm, and Obi-Wan remorsefully leaves him to burn to death beside a volcanic river.

Though horribly burned and disfigured by the flames of Mustafar, Vader manages to keep himself alive with the Force, through his unbreakable will and sheer hatred. Sidious, now Emperor of the Galactic Empire, finds him and takes him back to Coruscant to be reconstructed with his iconic suit. When he is told that he had "killed" Padmé in his anger, Vader becomes consumed by his despair and fully embraces his dark persona. In the film's epilogue, Vader is seen beside Sidious viewing the construction of the Death Star, setting up the events that follow to A New Hope.

A New Hope
When plans for the Empire's new weapon, the Death Star, were stolen by Rebel spies, Darth Vader was assigned to retrieve the plans. His Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator and men captured the CR90 corvette Tantive IV, where they captured Princess Leia Organa. Leia tries to talk her way out of the situation by threatening to have this reported back to the Imperial Senate on Coruscant, but Vader knows that Rebel spies transmitted the plans to her and demands to know where they are. Leia again tries to explain that she's an Imperial Senator on her way to Alderaan, but Vader condemns her as a member of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor before ordering his 501st Legion stormtroopers to take her away. When they could not find the plans aboard the ship, and an Imperial officer tells Vader that an escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were detected aboard it, Vader assumed they were hidden in the escape pod that R2-D2 and C-3PO were in and sent a squadron of troopers down to retrieve them while he returned to the Death Star. The troopers found the crashed escape pod, evidence of R2 and 3PO being there, and soon it led them to set up base in Mos Eisley in case the droids showed up there looking for transport off-planet.

Vader duels Obi-Wan on board the Death Star.
Vader tortured Leia with an IT-O Interrogation Unit to make her tell where the Rebel's secret base was while she was incarcerated in the Death Star's detention block, but she would not give in. Vader instead brings her to the bridge of the Death Star to meet with Death Star commanding officer and Governor of the Outer Rim Territories, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, where Leia is threatened with having Alderaan destroyed by the Death Star's superlaser if she doesn't give up the location of the Rebel base. Despite Leia confessing to the base being on Dantooine, Vader holds her back as she helplessly watches as Alderaan is destroyed anyway on Tarkin's order. When the Empire captured the Millennium Falcon, a freighter that had recently blasted its way out of the Mos Eisley Spaceport on Tatooine and arrived in the Alderaan system, Vader ordered a scanning crew to check every inch of the ship. Meanwhile, through the Force, he began to feel the presence of his former master Obi-Wan Kenobi aboard the station. After many years, he came face to face with Obi-Wan once again and engaged him in a second lightsaber duel, though this time he was determined to win. While he sensed Obi-Wan was growing weaker, he had also learned from his mistakes on Mustafar. Vader said so, but Kenobi warned that he would become more powerful than ever before if Vader killed him. The duel carried them across the hangar where they could see Luke and friends boarding the Millennium Falcon, while the stormtroopers that had been guarding it had moved to assist Vader if he required it. The battle ended when Obi-Wan deliberately dropped his defenses, allowing Vader to strike, ultimately leading to the Jedi Master's tragic fate, though when Vader checks Obi-Wan's robes, he finds no evidence of him having left a body behind. Vader was then prevented from pursuing Leia and the others as the blast doors to the hangar were sealed by the destruction of the control panel by Luke Skywalker.

When the Rebels commenced their attack on the Death Star, Vader joined the fight with two TIE pilots beside him as his wingmen. He easily took out many of the fighters by himself, including the initial Y-wing squadron making the first trench run and the X-wing squadron that attempted the second run under the command of Red Leader Garven Dreis, and just when he was about to destroy Luke Skywalker, who was making the final run, Han Solo and Chewbacca appeared out of nowhere in the Falcon and fired on the Imperials, destroying one of Vader's wingmen while sending Vader spiraling away when the other wingman clips his TIE Advanced and sends it tumbling away from the Death Star. When the Rebels succeeded in destroying the Death Star, Vader managed to gain control of his TIE Advanced and fled the scene.

The Empire Strikes Back
Three years later, Darth Vader tracked the location of the Rebels' new secret base on the ice planet, Hoth. From space, aboard his Executor-class Star Dreadnought Executor, flagship of the Imperial Navy, he oversaw the Battle of Hoth, dispatching Imperial AT-ATs and AT-STs against Luke Skywalker and the other members of Rogue Squadron as the Rebellion attempted a desperate evacuation of Echo Base before it was overrun. Vader finally arrived on the planet with his elite 501st Legion after Imperial Army General Maximillion Veers destroyed the Rebel shield generator with his AT-AT, only to learn that Luke had already escaped, arriving in the abandoned hangar just as the Millennium Falcon made its escape. Vader has the Executor and the fleet pursue the Falcon into the nearby asteroid belt, unconcerned about the damage the fleet was taking from the asteroids as they hunted the Falcon down. However, Vader was soon informed that he was being summoned by the Emperor via hologram, and after having the Executor leave the asteroid belt to avoid interference in the transmission, he spoke to the Emperor in his personal quarters, where the Emperor confirmed that Luke is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker, and thus planned to seduce him to the dark side of the Force as well, or perish if he refused.

Vader in a lightsaber duel against his son Luke.
At Cloud City, on the planet Bespin, Vader arranged a trap for Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Chewbacca, aided by bounty hunter Boba Fett, as well as Han's friend Lando Calrissian, baron-administrator for Cloud City. Vader then began to arrange for Luke to be frozen in a carbonite chamber and delivered to the Emperor, but chose to test it first on Han. Afterwards, he handed him over to Fett, who flew the frozen mercenary to Jabba's Palace on Tatooine aboard his ship, Slave I, to collect the bounty that Jabba had placed on Han's head for failing to repay his debt. Upon failing to freeze Luke, Vader then engaged Luke in a lightsaber duel, which ended on a catwalk above a giant ventilation pit. Initially, Vader had held back, but after Luke wounds him on the right shoulder, now he decided to end the battle on his own terms. After another flurry of swordplay, Vader severed the young Jedi's right hand and revealed to Luke that he is his father. He made a proposal for Luke to join him, where he would complete his son's training, and have him rule the galaxy alongside him, but Luke refused and narrowly escaped Cloud City.

Vader returned to the Executor just in time to learn that Imperial Admiral Firmus Piett's spies had deactivated the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon, so it was only a matter of time before the Rebel ship would be caught in the tractor beam of the flagship and brought aboard. During that time, Vader made psychic connection with Luke through the Force, asking him to come with him. However, R2-D2 is able to reactivate the hyperdrive, and the Falcon escapes into hyperspace to rejoin the Alliance Navy, leaving Vader to return to his personal quarters on the Executor without punishing Piett for failing to capture the Falcon.

Return of the Jedi
Around a year after the events of The Empire Strikes Back, Darth Vader was first seen arriving on the second Death Star to "check on" everyone's progress. The commanding officer of the second Death Star, Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod, tried to reason with him that he needed more manpower to finish construction, but when Vader warns him that the Emperor himself is coming to oversee the rest of the construction personally, Jerjerrod promises to double their efforts to finish on time, satisfying Vader, only to warn Jerjerrod again that the Emperor was not as forgiving as he was. When the Emperor arrived, Vader assured him that the Death Star would be finished in time. Once the Emperor settled into his throne room on the second Death Star, his orders to Vader are to deploy the main Imperial Navy fleet on the far side of Endor until called for. With that, he then dismisses Vader to the Executor to await further orders there. However, while on the Executor, Vader learns from Admiral Piett that a Lambda-class Imperial shuttle named Tydirium is requesting deactivation of the security shield for the second Death Star to land on the forest moon below. Suspicious, Vader asks where it is going and if they have a code clearance. When the reply comes back that the shuttle is carrying parts and technical crew for the forest moon and the code is an older Imperial code but is still valid, Vader hesitates as he discovers Luke is aboard the Tydirium through the Force. After a moment, he gives Piett the go ahead to let the shuttle through.

Returning to the second Death Star and the Emperor's throne room, Vader explains the situation regarding the Tydirium to the Emperor and his confirmation that Luke is with the Rebel strike team that was on the shuttle. Wanting to seize the moment, the Emperor orders Vader to head for the forest moon, foreseeing Luke willingly surrender to the Empire's forces in order to speak to Vader face-to-face.

The Emperor is proven right as Luke surrenders to an AT-AT walker patrol and brought to the landing pad where Vader's shuttle touches down, where the AT-AT crew hands him over to Vader. Once alone, Luke and Vader speak to each other, but despite Luke's best attempts to convince Vader to return to the light side of the Force, Vader tells him that Anakin Skywalker is dead and he will always be Darth Vader and loyal to the Emperor.

Vader brings his son to the Emperor.
Together, Vader and Luke met the Emperor in his throne room aboard the second Death Star, where the Emperor started playing upon Luke's fear for his friends' safety by revealing that Luke's friends on the forest moon of Endor and the Alliance Navy were walking into his trap. Intent on using Luke as a pawn to kill his own father, and thus take his place at the Emperor's side, he provokes Luke into engaging Vader in a fierce lightsaber duel. Vader assaulted Luke with Djem So, but Luke countered. Their duel continued until Luke hid in the darkness under the platform where the Emperor's throne stood, refusing to battle his father any further. When Vader probed his son's mind with the Force, he found out that Leia was his daughter too. Happy with this new information, he proclaims that if Luke will not turn to the dark side, perhaps Leia will. This threat angers Luke enough for him to viciously attack Vader and brutally overpower him. But after cutting off his father's right hand and noticing mechanical wires underneath that match his own right hand, Luke threw aside his lightsaber and told the Emperor that he would never turn to the dark side, remaining loyal to resurrecting the Jedi Order.

Vader then watched as the Emperor viciously tortured Luke with fierce Force Lightning attacks in retaliation for his refusal to join the Sith. Writhing in agony, Luke pleaded for his father to save him. At that point, Anakin Skywalker resurfaces, killing the Darth Vader persona once and for all, along with the Sith Order as Anakin slays the Emperor and fulfills the Chosen One prophecy while also setting into motion the destruction of the Galactic Empire as well.

The Force Awakens
This is all that is left of Darth Vader in the sequel trilogy.
Although Vader has been long dead for approximately thirty years, his burnt and distorted helmet is in the possession of his grandson, Ben Solo, who has turned to the dark side like him and assumed the identity of Kylo Ren, wanting to "finish what he started". To this end, Kylo Ren kept the helmet in his personal quarters and would place Vader's helmet on a table filled with the ashes of his slain enemies, speaking to it when he felt the pull of the light side.

As Han Solo and Leia Organa discuss about their son's turn to the dark side, they mention how he is too much like his grandfather, and Leia admits feeling guilty that she sent Ben to train with Luke Skywalker for fearing that he would become like Vader. Later, after Kylo abducted Rey, he tries to use the Force to probe her mind, but Rey turns his own power against him and senses that Kylo is afraid that he will never be as powerful as Vader.

The Last Jedi
Vader is mentioned a few of times throughout the film. Supreme Leader Snoke tells Kylo how he thought him as the successor of Vader, but then reprimands his apprentice for his failures and weakness, stating he is just a child in a mask pretending to be like his grandfather. Later, while discussing about the failure of the Jedi, Luke mentions how it was a Jedi (Obi-Wan) that trained Vader and subsequently caused his fall to the dark side, but Rey argues that it was also a Jedi (Luke) who saw the good in him and caused him to turn back to the light side.

When Rey is brought before Snoke on the Mega-class Star Dreadnought Supremacy, Snoke believes Kylo will fulfill his destiny in the dark side as the heir of Darth Vader while ordering his apprentice to kill Rey. Ironically, Kylo ends up betraying and killing his own master to save Rey, similar as Vader killed Emperor Palpatine to save Luke. Right after this, Ren asks Rey to join him to rule the galaxy by his side, during a scene in which the two resemble Anakin and Padmé Amidala when the fallen Jedi asked his wife the same shortly after his turn to the dark side in Revenge of the Sith, and years later Vader asks the same to Luke in The Empire Strikes Back.

The Rise of Skywalker
Even after being killed by Anakin thirty years before, Emperor Palpatine returns by resurrecting himself inside a cloned body. Palpatine reveals to Kylo Ren that he manipulated the young Ben Solo into turning to the dark side by creating Snoke and by whispering voices in his mind, including by impersonating Vader's voice to speak to Kylo.

Later, when Rey is searching for Ochi's blade after infiltrating the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer Steadfast on Kijimi, she sees Darth Vader's helmet inside Kylo Ren's quarters. Rey and Kylo's Force-bond connects them while she is still in the room and Kylo is at Kijimi's streets looking for her. They start to fight through their bond, and their lightsabers accidentally hit and destroy Vader's helmet. Part of the destroyed helmet is transferred through their bond and falls on the ground near Kylo's feet, which leads him to conclude that Rey is inside his quarters.

During the Battle of Exegol, Palpatine mentions that his first defeat only happened because of Vader's blood relation with his son while trying to convince Rey, his granddaughter, that no one would come for her since the Dark Lord is the only one of her family still alive. Contradicting Palpatine's prediction, Ben Solo, who is her other half due to a Force dyad connection, does come to save her. To avenge his previous death at the hands of Vader, the Emperor throws Ben in a pit saying that the last Skywalker will fall as he once did.

Anthology Films
Rogue One
Darth Vader in Rogue One.
Darth Vader appears in the Anthology film, Rogue One. He is portrayed by former kick-boxing champion, Spencer Wilding, while his voice was reprised by James Earl Jones.

Around some point before the battle of Yavin, Vader had established a personal abode, Fortress Vader, on Mustafar, the very planet where he had been disfigured. Shortly after the an insurgency on the desert moon of Jedha, Vader summoned Director Orson Krennic to discuss the workings of the Death Star and the possibility of a weakness within the weapon. Upon greeting Krennic, Vader quickly began to chastise Krennic for his inability to keep the existence of the Death Star a secret and his arrogance and demands of an audience with the Emperor only served to make Vader more harsh as he coldly made clear that he saw Tarkin as being much more competent than Krennic by rejecting his attempts to blame Tarkin for the destruction of Jedha. As Vader ended the conversation with a strict warning for Krennic to ensure that Galen Erso had not compromised the weapon in any way, Krennic believed this meant Vader had allowed him to remain in command of the Death Star project but such belief and his question if Vader would ask the Emperor to have an audience with Krennic finally removed any patience Vader had. Vader choked Krennic into submission and left him with a sardonic warning to temper his ambitions and not "choke" on them.

When the Rebellion successfully gained possession of the plans for the Empire's new weapon, Vader commanded the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator and easily crippled the already damaged Rebel flagship, the MC75 Star Cruiser Profoundity, before proceeding to infiltrate the ship. He soon engaged and pursued the Rebels who attempted to make their escape with a copy of the schematics of the Death Star, Vader's immense skill and power easily slaughtering the all-but-helpless Rebel soldiers. However, one of his victims managed to escape aboard the Tantive IV, which escaped into hyperspace and the Rebel gave the plans for the Death Star to Leia Organa, leading directly into the events of A New Hope.

Television Appearances
Star Wars Rebels
Darth Vader appears in the Disney XD animated series Star Wars Rebels, once again voiced by James Earl Jones who originally provided his voice in the Original Trilogy and Revenge of the Sith. In the series, he tasks the Empire's Inquisitors to hunt down the remaining Jedi Knights who may have survived the Great Jedi Purge.

Season One
In the extended cut of "Spark of Rebellion", Darth Vader makes a brief appearance during the opening of the film where he is briefing his deadly servant, The Grand Inquisitor, with new orders from the Emperor.

Even though the Jedi have been wiped out, the Sith have foreseen a new threat: the Children of the Force. Under the command of his master, the Emperor, Vader gave the Inquisitor the task to hunt down this new enemy and if they do not serve the Empire they should be eliminated along with any surviving Jedi who will attempt to train them.

In the end of the season finale; "Fire Across the Galaxy", Vader meets with Agent Kallus to deal with the Ghost cell personally.

Season Two
Following the rescue of Kanan Jarrus over Mustafar and the death of The Grand Inquisitor, rumors of what had happened became known, riots and uprisings begun to occur on several worlds. Concerned at the rise in Rebel activity, the Emperor sent Vader to Lothal with Grand Moff Tarkin to end the growing rebellion.

Vader duels against Kanan Jarrus.
Following his arrival, Vader met with Agent Kallus and Minister Tua to discuss his plans on dealing with the Rebels. Vader then had Kallus escort the Minister to her shuttle, where she was killed and the incident was blamed on the Rebels. When the Rebels tried to steal a shuttle to make their escape, Vader and his stormtroopers surrounded them. Vader engaged the leader of the Rebels, Kanan Jarrus, and his apprentice, Ezra Bridger, in a lightsaber duel. He was easily able to overpower them and attempted to kill Ezra with his own lightsaber until Kanan intervened. Zeb and Sabine used thermal detonators to cause an AT-DP to fall on him, but he survived and used the Force to lift the burning walker off him. The Rebels fled the scene in a stolen shuttle and instead of pursing them, he lets them go, knowing they will not leave the planet just yet. Vader also orders Tarkintown burned to turn opinion against them.

Vader then allowed the Rebels to escape through the blockade, letting them lead him to his true target; the Rebel fleet. Vader took his TIE Advanced to attack the Rebel fleet, destroying most of the fighters and severely damaging the command ship. During the fight, Vader sensed that his former apprentice, Ahsoka Tano, was alive and part of the Rebel fleet. When two Star Destroyers arrived, Vader tried to stop the Rebels from escaping, but lost them when they jumped into hyperspace and he got caught in the tractor beam.

Following his victory, Vader contacted Palpatine and informed him that Skywalker's apprentice was still alive and in league with the Rebels. Both Vader and the Emperor were pleased by this, knowing she could lead them to other Jedi survivors, even Obi-Wan Kenobi, whom Vader was still obsessed with seeking revenge upon for his defeat on Mustafar. Palpatine urged Vader to be patient when searching for his former master and then ordered him to send another Inquisitor to hunt the Rebels down. Vader later dispatched two new Inquisitors, Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister, to finish what he and the Grand Inquisitor had started.

Vader's mask shattered by Ahsoka.
Following the discovery of the Jedi Temple on Lothal, Vader later arrived at the Sith Temple discovered on Malachor after the death of the Inquisitors. Encountering Ezra, he questioned the boy as to how he opened the path to the Malachor Sith Temple; Ezra told him to find out himself and engaged Vader in battle, but the Sith Lord was too strong and easily destroyed Ezra's lightsaber. But before he could finish the boy off, Ahsoka arrived and engaged Vader. He eventually managed to knock Ahsoka out of the Temple and attempted to stop Ezra and a blinded Kanan from escaping. A recovered Ahsoka charged up behind Vader and slashed part of his mask off, knocking him down to the floor and exposing a considerable amount of his disfigured face, including his yellow right eye. Seeing that he really was her former master, Ahsoka refused to leave him again. For a few moments, Ahsoka's compassion appeared to have reached Vader, but he then shrugged it off; coldly declaring that she would die, he then ignited his lightsaber and moved to attack her again. As the pair resumed their battle, the temple collapsed and exploded around them, with Kanan and Ezra barely managing to escape. Vader survived the temple's collapse, but was badly wounded and limped away from the ruins.

Season Four
Vader makes a brief appearance in "A World Between Worlds", when he resumed his battle with Ahsoka from "Twilight of the Apprentice". It was revealed that Vader had the opportunity to strike Ahsoka down, but at that moment a time-displaced Ezra pulls Ahsoka into a portal with a dumbfounded Vader left alone in the collapsing temple. Vader escaped the temple unaware that Ahsoka was able to return to the temple's ruin sometime after his departure.

Printed Media
Darth Vader appears in most of the new canonical novels and comics tied in with the films created after Disney's purchase of Lucasfilm and Star Wars' expanded universe.

Amongst his more prominent appearances, the novel Lords of the Sith by Paul S. Kemp focuses on his and Palpatine's personal assault on the planet Ryloth, in which they battle and destroy a resistance created by Cham Syndulla, resulting in the enslavement of Ryloth and his and Palpatine's slaughter of an entire village of Twi'leks.

Vader is briefly mentioned in the novel Ahsoka, when the Grand Inquisitor is asked to hunt down an unknown Force-wielder that caused trouble on the moon of Raada one year after the formation of the Galactic Empire.

Darth Vader also stars in his own comic series, Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith, published by Marvel Comics (itself a Disney subsidiary since 2009). In these comics, he is shown hunting down Luke Skywalker and the other members of the Rebel Alliance as well as threats within the Empire itself. The series also discloses Vader's agenda and feats during his early years as a Sith Lord; among them, his training of the Inquisitorius is shown in depth, as is his hunt for any remaining Jedi, such as his killing of Jocasta Nu, Faren Barr, and Eeth Koth as well as his part in the subjugation of the watery world of Mon Cala. It is also revealed that he was given his late wife's Naboo starship for his own personal use, and that Palpatine granted Darth Vader the planet Mustafar as his own personal retreat, where he would build his castle overtop of a dark side cave. Later on in the series, during a confrontation in which he is defeated by a traitor to the Empire named Cylo IV, Vader also undergoes a mental battle between his good and evil halves (embodied by his Vader and Anakin personas, respectively) in which his evil half seemingly defeats his good half once and for all, suppressing it until the events of Return of the Jedi.

Star Wars: The Clone Wars
Darth Vader made an appearance in the final episode of Star Wars: The Clone Wars where he arrives on a moon Ahsoka fled to, to escape Order 66 and recovered Ahsoka's lightsaber from the wrecked cruiser.

Trivia
Darth Vader is one of the most iconic and popular of the Lucasfilm villains, with his popularity being comparable to that of the other Disney Villains.
On the set of The Empire Strikes Back, Darth Vader's identity as Luke's father was shrouded in secrecy. Along with his fellow cast members, David Prowse—who physically portrayed Vader and spoke all his lines before being overdubbed by James Earl Jones—was given a script with fake dialogue, the relevant line being replaced by "Obi-Wan killed your father." Hamill was only informed just before the scene was filmed, and did not even tell his wife. Hamill has said that Ford did not learn of the plot point until the premiere of the film.
Prior to his death, despite being burned alive on Mustafar and forced to become a cyborg, Vader still became the most powerful Force-user in the Star Wars universe. The only individual who is equal to Vader's Force potential, is his son Luke Skywalker, and possibly his daughter Leia Organa.
He is the first and only known character who was a Sith Lord and became a Force spirit, something the Sith are incapable of doing due to their obsession with the dark side of the Force. However, he is only able to become a spirit because he came back to the light side just before his death.
Concept art in The Art of Star Wars: The Force Awakens book revealed that Darth Vader was originally going to appear in the 2015 film Star Wars: The Force Awakens through Anakin's Force spirit. According to the concept artist Iain McCaig, his appearance would fluctuate between his Anakin and Vader personas, representing the character's duality.
Although he never managed to prevent his wife to die in childbirth and later failed to bring her back from the dead, his grandson Ben Solo, accomplishes to revive the woman he loves, Rey, by using Force healing. With this, Ben succeeded where his grandfather failed and fulfilled his word to finish something Vader started, even if it was in a way Ben didn't expect at first.
In the extended version of Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion, Darth Vader's character design is close to the original concept art by Ralph McQuarrie that was used during the early production.
His voice actor, James Earl Jones, would later go on to voice Mufasa in The Lion King. Ironically, the shoe would be on the other foot in these roles: Specifically, Vader later revealed to be Luke's father, had Luke's uncle Owen Lars murdered, while Mufasa, Simba's father, would end up murdered by Simba's uncle. When Mufasa is a ghost, his voice sounded very similar.
Vader is briefly mentioned in the DuckTales episode "All Ducks on Deck" when the Phantom Blot is comparing himself to other villains: "I make Darth Vader look as scary as the hood ornament of a '53 Buick!" At the time the episode aired, Disney had not acquired the rights to Star Wars yet.
In Toy Story 2, there is a spoof of Vader's famous line (No, I am your father) when Emperor Zurg reveals himself to Buzz Lightyear. The same film also briefly had Buzz Lightyear mimicking Darth Vader's breathing in the beginning. In addition, Zurg, when encountering Buzz Lightyear at the beginning of the same film, says "We meet again Buzz Lightyear, for the last time!", similar to Vader's opening when encountering Obi Wan on the Death Star in A New Hope – "I've been waiting for you Obi Wan. We meet again, at last."
In the sequel Toy Story 3, Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster, similar to Vader's redemption by defeating Emperor Palpatine.
Vader's line to Leia when ordering for her arrest was also parodied with Bad Buzz in the same film. Coincidentally, both Bad Buzz and Darth Vader were seduced by the bad guy (Lotso and Palpatine, respectively), although in the former's case, it was closer to being brainwashed.
In the Buzz Lightyear of Star Command episode "Stranger Invasion", during their battle at the end of the episode, Zurg says Vader's "I am your father" line to Buzz to confuse him, right before punching his face and saying "Psych! Made ya look, you dimwit!"

In Chicken Little during the scene where Chicken Little, Abby, Runt, and Fish discover Kirby before multiple aliens attack Oakey Oaks, Runt explains "Darth Vader is Luke's father?", an allusion to the Star Wars franchise.
In Wreck-It Ralph, which was released in theaters only four days after Lucasfilm was bought by Disney, Ralph mimics Vader's breathing when he breathes through a candy straw while hiding out in a chocolate pond.
A scuba mask was used to make Darth Vader's famous breathing noise.
Darth Vader was parodied in The Muppet Show twice, once in the episode Crystal Gayle appeared in and once in the episode where several Star Wars characters appeared. Both times he was "played" by Gonzo and his iconic mask had Gonzo's hook nose.
The scene in The Empire Strikes Back where his helmet is lowered onto his burnt head was homage in an episode of American Dragon: Jake Long when The Huntsman's helmet is lowered onto his burnt head.
In the Kim Possible movie, A Stitch in Time after running into a future version of Duff Killigan, as a robot Ron Stoppable says he's more machine than Golfer now, which is a take on Obi-Wan saying that Vader was more machine now than man in Return of the Jedi.
In Flubber, Weebo called Professor Brainard Darth Vader as joke while he was working on Flubber tags for the basketball game.
In the Darkwing Duck episode "A Duck By Any Other Name", Tuskerninni dresses up like Darth Vader while robbing a bank.
Star Wars was parodied in the Big City Greens episode "Clubbed" as "Constellation Battles" with the villain's name being Garth Crater.
In the Blossom pilot when Six is explaining menopause to Blossom she tells her "You'll grow a beard and sound like Darth Vader".
In the episode "Dad's Girlfriend", Tony is dressed in a motorbike gear and says he felt like Darth Vader, he then mimicks Darth and says "The force is strong with this one" (referring to Blossom).

In the Once Upon A Time episode when The Wicked Queen is trying to persuade Harry to join her dark mission, Harry tells her "You can't Darth Vader me!"
In the climax of the Bonkers episode "Springtime for the Iguana", though in a brightly colored costume, Bonkers spoke in a deep booming voice (like Darth Vader's) while wearing the costume.
A character by the name of Duck Vader appears in a few issues of Donald Duck & Co., and wears the same suit but instead with a noticeable beak.
In the Blossom season 3 episode "The Best Laid Plans of Mice and Men", Joey Russo impersonated Darth Vader and quoted his famous line, "Luke, I am your father."
In the Doug season 3 episode "Quailman Vs. the Triad of Terror" a parody of Darth Vader named "Darken Vader" appears.
