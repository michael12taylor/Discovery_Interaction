<html><p>As the war continued, Minerva remained at Hogwarts, even when it was taken over by Voldemort. This was most likely to make sure as little harm came to students, since she could act as an insider so that the Order of the Phoenix was informed on what was going on at Hogwarts. Even when Severus was appointed Headmaster and Alecto and Amycus Carrow were given free rein in the school, Minerva did as much as she could to protect the students. The rebel alliance Dumbledore's Army founded by the students reformed and McGonagall helped to keep their meetings a secret.[12]

Battle of Hogwarts
On 1 May 1998, Minerva was present when Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley returned to Hogwarts in the middle of the night in search of Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem. That night, she found Amycus at the door to Ravenclaw Tower, furiously assaulting it and demanding to be let in. Dryly pointing out that perhaps his sister, whom Professor Flitwick had admitted earlier at their urgent request, could open the door and prevent him from waking half the castle. Minerva then intervened on his behalf after he told her that Alecto wasn't responding.[12]

McGonagall protecting students during Snape's regime
When the door opened, they found Alecto unconscious on the floor, which Minerva surmised as the work of a Stunning Spell. Amycus then revealed that they had been warned that Harry might try to get into Ravenclaw Tower, to which Minerva responded with confusion as Harry was in her house, speaking of this with pride in her voice, before scanning the room. Amycus then horrified her by stating his plan to push the blame for Alecto summoning Voldemort on the children in the dormitories, without remorse or concern that they would likely be killed or horribly tortured. Minerva refused to allow it, prompting the Death Eater to spit in her face, only to be flung across the room with the Cruciatus Curse when Harry, who had witnessed the whole thing from under his Invisibility Cloak, revealed himself in sheer anger. With both Carrow siblings now incapacitated, Minerva used the Imperius Curse to gain their wands, before she magically restrained and confined them to the Ravenclaw Common Room.  

Realising that a battle was upon them, Minerva engaged Severus Snape, the Headmaster at the time, in a fierce duel. Whilst Snape did put up a good defence, McGonagall gained the upper hand in the duel quickly, and when Filius Flitwick and Pomona Sprout arrived, Snape fled, now severely outnumbered. Minerva, believing his escape was motivated by fear, called him a coward as fled the school.[12]

Harry informed McGonagall of a quest that Dumbledore had left him. In respect for Dumbledore's wishes, she offered to hold Voldemort and his army back for whilst Harry fulfilled this quest. She then proceeded to lead the defence of the school against the Death Eaters with Kingsley Shacklebolt, personally animating virtually all of the castle's suits of armour and statues to help her defend the school.[12] Shortly before the battle, Minerva ordered Neville Longbottom with the aid of Seamus Finnigan and other students to destroy the Wooden Bridge so that the Snatchers could not sneak into school grounds.[23] To ensure the advantage of chaos on their side, she also ordered Argus Filch to find Peeves and bring him to her, which he did in response to her agitation.[12]

Minerva and Molly Weasley preparing for battle
After ordering the evacuation of younger students through the Hog's Head, Minerva began to help fortify the castle against the coming attack, with the assistance of her fellow teachers, Order members, and even the older students who had stayed behind to fight. When Pansy Parkinson suggested they take the deal offered to them by Voldemort — that of their lives in exchange for Harry Potter — Minerva ordered the cowardly girl and all those not willing to fight to leave.[12]

Minerva fought skillfully in the first part of the battle, during which she could have sworn she saw one of the statues that usually flanks the school's Main Gates dive-bombing a cluster of Death Eaters[24] and also leading a herd of enchanted desks into the fray at one point. She would later stand defiant in the lull and among many students in a crowd when Voldemort himself walked into the Hogwarts grounds. It was only when she saw Harry Potter's body being carried by Hagrid that she began to despair, letting out a scream terrible to anyone who heard it, equal to that of Ron, Hermione, and Ginny's together. Nonetheless, Minerva continued to fight when the battle resumed after the attack by the Centaurs on Voldemort and the Death Eaters. In the final moments of the battle, she duelled Voldemort himself to a stalemate alongside Horace Slughorn and Kingsley Shacklebolt, though they were blasted aside by his fury when Bellatrix Lestrange was killed in a duel with Molly Weasley.[12]

Minerva and other onlookers watch as Harry Potter defeats Voldemort for the final time
McGonagall was present when Voldemort's Killing Curse connected with Harry's Disarming Charm and was rebounded, signalling his final defeat at Harry's hands. She, along with everyone else in the Great Hall, hugged Harry in an uncharacteristic display of great emotion. She was one of the first to reach Harry, right behind Hermione, Ron, and Ginny. This event signalled the end of the Second Wizarding War.[12] In the aftermath of the battle, Professor McGonagall brought the winged bore statue's part in the battle to the attention of Professor Flitwick, who thought it an unlikely story seen as no one was known to have enchanted them, which subsequently lead to a long-standing disagreement between the two as to whether or not the Winged Boar Statues had, in fact, participated in the Battle of Hogwarts.[24]

As Headmistress of Hogwarts (1998–)
Early career
Headmistress McGonagall in her office
With the conclusion of the war, Minerva was awarded the Order of Merlin, First Class, by Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt for her unwavering allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix, was featured on a Chocolate Frog Card, (an accolade she later admitted she had never imagined receiving,[13]) and four months later, by which time the damages done to the castle during the battle had been duly repaired and the protective enchantments around the castle and grounds restored, she was also officially appointed to the position of Headmistress by the Hogwarts Board of Governors.[25] Ultimately, the faculty were ready to accept a new batch of first-year students for the 1998–1999 school year on 1 September. During this term, the school also guided those who would have otherwise completed their studies had it not been for the Magic is Might Campaign of Lord Voldemort and his followers, such as Muggle-borns like Hermione Granger, in finishing their N.E.W.T.s.[26]  And while Professor McGonagall eventually went on to become a revered and inspirational Headmistress, it was not an altogether untroubled transition, as the final battle had left marks both seen and unseen upon the denizens of Hogwarts Castle. The school for instance, though rebuilt, still bore scars decades later,[27] and for years after the the Dark Lord's last stand, nearly all of their students were able to see the Thestrals that pulled the Hogwarts carriages; serving as a constant, painful reminder of the cost of said event.[24] One such student was Grim Fawley;  a young student in Hufflepuff House whose own magical education had been marred by the loss of both his parents to the Death Eaters in his second year, the same year saw him evacuated along with most of his peers while the older students, teachers and members Order of the Phoenix waged the legendary Battle of Hogwarts, which resulted in the defeat of Lord Voldemort and the conclusion of the Second Wizarding War.

Upon assuming her new position, Minerva relocated; moving out of her sparse, stone-floored bedroom off of the first-floor corridor and took up permanent residence in Professor Dumbledore's old quarters, whereupon her new study became the home to among other things a self-playing harp whose tones could often heard around midday between classes.[28] In the time that followed, Professor McGonagall was responsible for, among other things, finding someone to replace her as the school's Transfiguration teacher,[29] finding a new, permanent replacement for the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor, and the eventual employment of her former student Neville Longbottom to the Herbology department, under head of department, Pomona Sprout.[30][25] When Grim eventually graduated with five Outstanding and one Exceeds Expectations on his N.E.W.T.s. five years later in 2003, Minerva wrote him a glowing letter of recommendation for his job application when he showed at interest in joining the Ministry of Magic; which helped him land a job in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, where he would work as a research assistant at the Auror Office.[31]

Later career
At some point in 2008, ten years after the Battle of Hogwarts took place, Minerva gave Hermione Granger, who had since joined the Ministry and risen to a high-placed office in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, permission for Dumbledore's old notes on The Tales of Beedle the Bard to be published as part of her new translation of the book.[32] Sometime before 1 September that same year,[33] she also tasked Rubeus Hagrid with serving as a special messenger to the family of a young Muggle-born that had been admitted to the school in order explain to the child's parents about the existence of magic, deliver their letter of acceptance and take said student-to-be to Diagon Alley in London to purchase the necessary school supplies. Having diligently continued to collect the newcomers escorted by Professor Hagrid even after she was in a position to delegate that task, Professor McGonagall brought the aforementioned Muggle-born and the rest of the new students to the Great Hall. Addressing the students, she held a brief speech about the importance of unity in spite of their individual differences, citing their victory at the Battle of Hogwarts as a prime example of what the castle's residents may accomplish when they work together and putting at ease nervous students by reminding them that even the famous Harry Potter had started out a student just like themselves. While overseeing the annual Sorting ceremony, however, where she saw the sorting of among others Daniel Page, Colby Frey, Lottie Turner and Robyn Thistlethwaite into their respective houses, it quickly became clear that one of the new students, a girl by the name of Ivy Warrington, was missing from the group. Fortunately, Hagrid had found her and brought her forward, explaining she had been distracted by bushes outside the castle. McGonagall found the situation of a student late for the Sorting ceremony to be highly unusual. Nevertheless, she suggested the rest of the student body should enjoy the Start-of-Term Feast while they still could, as they would have to be well-rested before embarking on the new term.[25]

Later that term, the Headmistress was occupied elsewhere when a group of first-year students sneaked into the Headmistress' Tower to use the pensieve to view a memory that had been contained within the locket of Ivy Warrington, and as such presumably unaware of their intrusion until afterwards. In light of her disappearance at the beginning of the term, however, Professor McGonagall had reached out to Ivy's family to keep them informed on the situation, and eventually gotten in touch with Miss Warrington's grandmother, whom she invited to the castle so she could help shred light on the reason behind Ivy's erratic behaviour and apparent memory loss. Sympathetic to the difficulty of Madam Warrington's position in deciding to modify the memory of her own grandchild to spare her the pain of knowing that she had accidentally vanished her own sister, she commended the old witch for her good intentions and assured her that in spite of everything, Ivy had underwent a tremendous amount of personal growth over the course of her first term, and voiced the opinion that she and the group of friends she had made had a bright future ahead of them.[34]

2015–2016 school year
Having appointed Mr Lupin the new Head Boy over the summer holidays leading up to his seventh and last year at the school; Minerva greeted the students for the new term; which at its conclusion would see the departure of said student, and at its beginning saw the arrival of among others young James Potter, the oldest son of Harry and Ginevra. During the Sorting ceremony, he was - to no one's surprise - sorted into Gryffindor House.[35]

2017–2018 school year
Ready to welcome a new batch of first year students on 1 September, 2017 for the new term; once the new students had been picked up at the Hogsmeade station, ferried across the Black Lake and escorted up to the castle, they were shown into the Great Hall to partake in the customary Sorting ceremony; which was overseen by Minerva herself. Embarking on their magical educations that year was the sons of the alums and Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, James and Scorpius, who both earned worldwide fame as the hero that vanquished Lord Voldemort, and notoriety as a Death Eater, respectively. During said event, the latter was - to no one's surprise - placed in Slytherin House, as his ancestors before him. But so was - to the shock of everyone in attendance - Harry's second son Albus.[36]

2018–2019 school year
Minerva McGonagall as the Headmistress of Hogwarts
Assisting the SOS Task Force
Following the outbreak of the Calamity sometime before December of 2018,[37] a confounding piece of chaotic magic that caused magical artefacts, creatures, people, and even memories to mysteriously appear in the Muggle world that resulted in a number of large-scale breaches of the International Statute of Secrecy, the International Confederation of Wizards and the Ministry of Magic in London eventually partnered to create an international task force whose sole purpose would be to investigate and contain the situation. In light of these developments, the faculty at Hogwarts, with Minerva at the helm, dutifully lent their expertise to the Calamity Management Team to help the agents of the recently established Statute of Secrecy Task Force with onerous job of investigating and contain the a "confounding" piece of chaotic magic, wherein the Hogwarts Headmistress was put in charge of overseeing Calamity Investigators wishing to pursue a career as Professors, whom she warned of the difficulties they would have to face along the way, as well as the fact that they might be called upon to do things they never thought possible. To this end, she invited at least one such person to join the teaching staff at Hogwarts in time for the new term in order to get some experience educating young witches and wizards.[38]

Upon the arrival of a Calamity Investigator to Hogwarts Castle to take up a teaching position, Professor McGonagall welcomed the individual by giving them a copy of the letters that were once exchanged between Albus Dumbledore and Adalbert Waffling to help improve their skills in addressing the Calamity, specifically in fighting Impaired Foes.[39] Along with teaching them the Deterioration Hex for purpose of weaken their foes,[40] she also showed them how to draw on the strength of others when in combat,[41] how to systematically work with academic research to improve their attention for detail,[42] and how to augment the effects of the exceptionally powerful Protection Charm they had previously been taught by Filius Flitwick by adjusting their stance.[43] During this time, she would also lecture them on how to better connect with their teammates, which helped them get better results with their Proficiency Charm.[44]

As she had done during her time as acting headmistress after Albus Dumbledore's suspension by the Board of Governors during the 1993–1994 school year, Minerva was determined to run the school as normally as they possibly could under the circumstances. As such, the Inter-House Quidditch Cup was held as planned, and at some point after the tryouts of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Professor McGonagall announced to an gathering of students in the Great Hall that Rose Granger-Weasley had made the it as their new Chaser.[44] Despite their best efforts of everyone involved, however, it eventually became glaringly obvious that the security measures that had been put in place to ensure the safety of the school's residents were woefully insufficient to stop the Calamity from claiming victims from within the castle itself. At some point, students from all the four houses became Foundables which appeared in the Muggle world, which Minerva was unable to control. Many items and special artefacts from Hogwarts became Foundables as well (such as portraits), along with several Hogwarts staff memebers, including Minerva herself.[45]

2019–2020 school year
Back to Hogwarts
Shortly before the beginning of the 2019–2020 school year, she learned that a highly talented student in Slytherin House would withdraw from the school and transfer to Beauxbatons Academy of Magic to distance herself from the surges of chaotic magical activity that was running rampant in Britain, as the Calamity apparently targeting her House.[46] Even so, the Headmistress took no small amount of pride in the fact that more than seventy-four percent of the volunteers that had taken time off their busy schedules to assist the Ministry - by quill and parchment - with the job of tracking, sorting, cataloguing, collating, and archiving returned Foundables for the Ministry were current and former members of Hufflepuff House.[46] Around the same time, Minerva also received owls from no less than three students in Ravenclaw House asking if they could receive their lesson plans early as not to fall behind in their studies, an exchange she noted that it was not uncommon for her to have with students of that house at the beginning of each term.[46]

When the Hogwarts Express was whisked away by The Calamity just shortly prior to its scheduled departure on 1 September, however, she quickly solicited the assistance of a highly reputable member of the SOS Task Force that Hermione Granger had recommended, hoping said individual could returned the train in time for the new school year. In the meantime, however,  due to the ongoing surge, a number of Foundables materialised on the school grounds, including Werewolves and Fire-breathing chickens, expressing the concern that lest the Calamity was not dealt with, she would have to spend the entire school term keeping First Year Gryffindors and Rubeus Hagrid away from them.

The Calamity Investigator was eventually successful in returning the Hogwarts Express in time for the start of the term, much to the relief of Minerva; who pointed out that the time-honoured tradition of riding the train to school was as much part of the "Hogwarts experience" as the Sorting ceremony. She was also relieved to hear of the safe return of the Trolley witch, who had been turned into a Foundable and at some point afterwards retrieved by the aforementioned Task Force member, saying that the Hogwarts Express would not be the same without her and her sweets, noting that she could remember her working at the train even back when Minerva herself was a student, during which she was "partial" to her Pumpkin Pasties.[46]

That was not to say that her troubles was over, however, as The Calamity hit the school itself next, spiriting off with the Sorting Hat, a Thestrals from Hogwart's herd, one of their carriages, a boat, a Winged Boar Statue and even the sign directing people between Hogwarts Castle and Hogsmeade Village; all of which the same diligent individual was able to retrieve and return to their allotted places, much to the delight of the denizens of Hogwarts Castle. Upon thanking their saviour, the Headmistress informed them that the school had suffered no lasting effects from the recent outburst of the Calamity, not counting the students' new favourite excuse for nothing finishing their schoolwork in time; 'the Calamity stole my homework!'[46]

The Lost Love
Later on during the term, Professor McGonagall reached out to the same individual that had done such an exemplary job helping the school earlier that school year, informing them that the Calamity had spirited away with quite a few of items of a "personal and private nature", soliciting their assistance in getting them back. Along on this endeavour was one of her former students and fellow Head of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force, Constance Pickering, who kept commenting and asking questions about each of the artefacts as they were retrieved, much to the dismay of the Headmistress. The first possession to be returned to her self-playing harp, at which point Minerva showed signs of mild exasperation when she had to explain to Miss Pickering that the self-playing instrument had, as the name suggests, been bewitched to play itself. The next items on the list was the memory of a hornbill that she once owned, which she had used as a teaching aid during her career as a Transfiguration professor, and remembered it fondly as "a good bird", although she had not viewed it as a pet, as she was more partial to cats. The next items on the list included a school crest and her Order of Merlin, First Class, which she had framed and kept in her office, and an old photo of Dougal McGregor, about whom she refused to comment when Pickering questioned the man's identity, saying only that he was "a man [she} once knew" and that that was all she was prepared to say on the matter.[47] When all of the items had been retrieved, she lightly admonished Miss Pickering for prying into her personal life, noting that she had a keen and inquisitive mind, but that she needed to learn that she did not have the right to the answer of every question just because she asked.[47]

Inter-House Cup
In spite of the fact that the security of the castle had been breached more than once as a result of the Calamity, and, having taken into account the prevailing theory that if enough people focused on something, it could affect how said phenomenon behaved, the decision to permit the annual and always much anticipated Inter-House Quidditch League to go on as planned was not one Minerva made lightly. Having concluded, however, that the collective disappointment at its cancellation would be more likely to trigger a new surge with Hogwarts at the heart of it than to allow the student body their yearly competition, the new season was held as normal. It was later noted that the Gryffindor Quidditch team had, despite some injuries on the part of the players, a fine showing that season, as had the Slytherin team, which the Headmistress herself judged to have been deserving recognition for their successes. Having proceeded without incidents for most of its duration, it was only as the final matches of the contest that the Calamity was drawn back to the Scottish Highlands and whisked away with among other things the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup. Upon learning this, Professor McGonagall alerted the Ministry of Magic, which sent an agent from the Statute of Secrecy Task Force to recover the all. One of the Foundables in question was an old Nimbus 2000, prompting a Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team to grow concerned that her broom, which of the same model, might vanish and be weakened if the same happened to hers, to which her headmistress assured her that the broom in question was almost certainly the echo of the one that once belonged to another, famous student that played on their team years earlier. When the Gryffindor house ghost, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, was spirited away by the Calamity along with the cup and turned him into a Foundable, Minerva was delighted to see his safe return, stating that she had meant to ask his opinion on the Calamity, seen as how he, being somewhat separated from his original self, just like the Foundables were, perhaps had some interesting insights into the Calamity they had not considered.[48]

2020–2021 school year
As though the Calamity was not bad enough; conceding with the ongoing catastrophe was also the discovery that various dark and dagerous magical creatures that had once allied themselves with the Dark Lord had began to behave rather conspicuously. As a staple in the magical community, Minerva was present at the Extraordinary General Meetings, most notably the meeting in 2020 where they discussed the concerning movement of Voldemort's allies. Furthermore, Minerva also revealed that someone had taken Boomslang skin and lacewing flies from the Potions stores during the summer break, the ingredients for Polyjuice Potion.[36]

Assisting Albus Potter
Minerva and Harry arguing over Albus and Scorpius's friendship
When Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy did not arrive at Hogwarts with the Hogwarts Express on 1 September, 2020, Minerva sent owls to their parents and later met with Harry Potter, Ginny Potter and Draco Malfoy, along with Minister for Magic Hermione Granger and her husband Ron Weasley, to find them. Minerva even suggested having Professor Longbottom aid them, due to his expertise in Herbology being useful in the Forbidden Forest.[36] After Albus and Scorpius meddled in time and made it so Ron and Hermione never married, Albus was Sorted into Gryffindor and Ron married Padma Patil, Minerva was still Headmistress of Hogwarts. She tried to advise Harry on interfering in Albus and Scorpius's friendship, but he insisted on keeping them separated and blackmailed Minerva into using the Marauder's Map to keep them apart.[36]

Minerva examines the Marauder's Map with Draco Malfoy, Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley
But, after using the map a few times and once purposefully ignoring the two because they were under the Invisibility Cloak, Minerva was again visited by Harry, Ginny and Draco and told him that she wanted no part in ruining friendships, to which he apologised and begged that she use the map to find Albus and Scorpius so that he can apologise to him too. Minerva used the map to discover that they were in the girls' bathroom on the first floor. Minerva and the parents tried to find them, but Moaning Myrtle reveals that they used a Time-Turner to save Cedric Diggory, much to Minerva's shock.[36] When Albus and Scorpius returned to the original timeline, Minerva found them and they confessed what they had done. Minerva invited Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ronald Weasley and Draco Malfoy to meet with her and reminded them that although Albus and Scorpius were being noble, their meddling had returned them to the darkest times of the wizarding war, and to never forget that their current peaceful world had been created because of the sacrifices those who lost their lives had made. As punishment for their recklessness, however, she put both in detention for the reminder of the year, and placed on them both a blanket ban on all future Hogsmeade trips, before telling them to find the missing Time-Turner.[36]

Physical appearance
Minerva McGonagall
Minerva McGonagall was said to be a tall, rather severe-looking, and "sprightly" seventy-year-old woman. She had black hair which was rarely let down, and the majority of the time was combed back into a tight bun.[5] In her youth, Minerva was described to not be as beautiful as her mother, but she was still rather pretty according to her picture in that age.  

Minerva always had a very prim expression. She also was known for her mouth to become very thin whenever she was angry. Harry Potter made analogies to McGonagall looking like she was going to explode, breathe fire and shoot sparks from her nose based on how transparent her anger could appear. When Minerva was happy or relaxed, she seemed like a different person entirely. She was capable of blending into Muggle crowds though Harry noted that the appearance didn't suit her.

Minerva often wore emerald green robes or her favourite tartan pattern. She wore square spectacles that matched the markings around the eyes of her Animagus and Patronus: a silver tabby cat. She also wore a pointed hat cocked to one side. As Minerva was a fan of tartan print and would often wear it to Quidditch games along with a woolly hat covering her ears. 

Personality and traits
Minerva smiling at the Yule Ball, a rare occurrence
Minerva almost constantly exuded magnanimity and sternness, being held in great respect (and some fear) by nearly all students and staff. Used to having her way, she tolerated neither audacity nor silliness from her pupils and was known to turn cold towards people who said or did things in front of her that were stupid, or if she thought they were trying to be funny.[21] She was a woman who rarely smiled or gave compliments freely. Despite her stern demeanour, Minerva did exhibit a dry sense of humour which usually came out when times were tough. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind and showed quite a sharp tongue, especially during arguments.[11]

True to Gryffindor, Minerva valued bravery and courage highly, believing cowardice be a heavy flaw. She fought the Death Eaters and protected her students, proving her bravery. Despite her loyalty to her house, Minerva was a fair-minded person who was known for docking points from students in her own House when she saw it must be done.[3] Although she permitted of-age students to choose whether they wanted  to stay or evacuate for the Battle of Hogwarts as a respect for their valour and rights, she gave the strict orders for anyone underage to evacuate, prioritising their safety over their courage and refusing to let under-qualified children risk  dying in battle despite their desires.[12]

For the most part, though, Minerva usually maintained great emotional composure, without being indifferent. Although she wasn't always particularly personable, she could be very warm and supportive during times of trouble or loss and cared a great deal about her students, both personally and academically. She was known to be extremely caring in times of tragedy, being known for her kindness in her own reserved manner. Though it rarely happened, Minerva showed a temper that could reveal itself on occasions when she was angry or flustered.[21] Apparently, she shared this temper with her father. Upon seeing Harry's alleged death, Minerva screamed in such despair that Harry never heard before.[12]

As the devoted instructor of Transfiguration classes, Minerva highly respected this specific branch of magic, which she considered  be among the most difficult and sophisticated magic that Hogwarts students learn.  She become an Animagus - a complicated, long process- to further her study in this subject and enjoyed correcting articles in Transfiguration Today. On the other hand, Minerva had very little patience for the field of Divination, due to its impreciseness and rarity of true Seers.[20]

Though she gave up Quidditch on leaving Hogwarts, the innately competitive Minerva later took a keen interest in the fortunes of her house team and retained a keen eye for Quidditch talent. She enjoyed watching Quidditch, and supported the Montrose Magpies.

Minerva inherited her cast-iron moral sense from her father. As a law-abiding citizen, she respected the particular law that all Animagi of Britain must register, insisting that Talbott Winger do so despite understanding his reason of secrecy. She wasn't inducted into the Order of the Phoenix during Voldemort’s first climb to power because the Order was held as a renegade outfit by the Ministry, who feared Dumbledore’s charisma and magical talent and were inclined to harbour fears that he wished to succeed them. Instead, she became their informant and bravely spied on Voldemort's followers in the guise of a cat.[11]

However, by the time of the second wizarding war, Minerva was no longer prepared to act as a spy for a Ministry she believed had become corrupt and dangerous. She is known to have a very severe dislike and hatred of those who abused power, such as her making an enemy of Dolores Umbridge for the latter's bigoted and sadistic behaviour. This also displayed her own distaste for racial prejudice and sadism.[11] Following the confrontation with the Death Eaters who had invaded Hogwarts at the time of Albus Dumbledore’s death, Minerva became a fully fledged member of the Order of the Phoenix, which was now, more than ever, seen as an outlaw organisation. Similarly, she stood up to Amycus Carrow, despite the Death Eater's higher authority at the time, refusing to let him blame the students for Alecto's blunder and looked down at him with pure disgust.[12]

In her free-time, Minerva was known to enjoy needlework.[1]

Magical abilities and skills
Minerva McGonagall's Patronus, a cat
Minerva McGonagall was an incredibly powerful and talented witch whom none should have ever underestimated. Her magical prowess allowed her to be the teacher of Transfiguration, a remarkably complex field of magic which she proved to be an expert in. She was also highly capable in many areas of magic as well as Transfiguration, the proof of this being she survived both Wizarding Wars and a duel with Voldemort himself, as well as correctly brewing the extremely advanced Animagus potion at only seventeen years of age. She was also the only person ever seen to produce three Patronus charms at once, which she additionally did non-verbally. Many wizards and witches alike are unable to produce one Patronus whilst saying the incantation, so this is further evidence of Minerva's world class ability.

Magical mastery: Minerva was an exceptionally powerful and talented witch, having inherited such talent from her mother and great-grandmother. She achieved top grades in her O.W.Ls and N.E.W.Ts when she was at Hogwarts, being quickly recognised as the most outstanding student of her year, with a particular talent for Transfiguration. During her school years, she was the recipient of several awards such as the "Transfiguration Today Most Promising Newcomer Award". As an adult, Minerva displayed her tremendous skills and powers by successfully becoming the Head of Transfiguration, Deputy Headmistress, and Headmistress at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She had extremely advanced magical knowledge, proving herself capable time and time again of mastering and performing highly advanced and difficult spells. Voldemort himself respected her ability, given that even when he controlled the school, and her unwavering loyalty to Dumbledore, she was kept on as Transfiguration professor showing her Transfiguration skills were tremendous. Her duelling skills were also exceptional, for she faced some of the greatest magical talent of the age and lived to tell the tale. When facing Snape in battle, one of the few wizards who could have rivalled McGonagall for magical skill, her magical assault was such he was forced onto the back foot almost immediately. Along with surviving both Wizarding Wars, she even went on to challenge Voldemort himself along with Horace Slughorn and Kingsley Shacklebolt at the very end of the second wizarding war, holding him at bay from harming the crowd that had gathered to watch. Though they were ultimately overpowered, neither side were able to hurt the other, further showing her extraordinary skill.
Wandless and nonverbal magic: Minerva was shown to be extremely skilful at non-verbal magic for a wide variety of spells, especially transfiguration spells and charms which she could perform with just a wave of her wand. This is a testament to her formidable magical skills as both these branches of magic are difficult to begin with not to mention to do them non verbally which requires intense concentration and focus. She could even perform certain spells intentionally without her wand, such as the Avifors spell[49] and often wandlessly conjured a textbook into her hands during Transfiguration class. She stalemated and gained the upper hand over Severus Snape in a fierce duel without uttering a single incantation which is further evidence of her extraordinary skills - lesser witches and wizards seemed to produce weaker magic when using non-verbal spells or under the influence of Silencing Charms, but she seemed unhindered. She was fully capable of disintegrating Snape's fiery serpent he sent at her with just a wave of her wand and instantly turning it into swarm of daggers without saying the incantation. They were so powerful even without the incantation that he was forced to hide behind a suit of armour.[9] She non-verbally untransfigured Draco Malfoy when he was turned into a ferret by simply pointing her wand at him.[50] When Neville Longbottom vanished one of the legs of his desk by accident during a lesson, she had it back very shortly after with just a wave of her wand. She also non-verbally conjured a length of shimmering silver rope to hang the Carrow siblings before the Battle of Hogwarts to incapacitate them.[9] If her ability to conjure three consecutive Patronuses at once was not impressive enough, it should also be noted she did so non-verbally, which is an extraordinarily challenging feat, considering the difficulty of conjuring a single one with the incantation.[9]
McGonagall duelling Snape
Duelling: Minerva was an immensely skilful duellist. She was described as moving "faster than Harry Potter would have believed", displaying an incredible amount of speed and precision with her spell work. Though she was hit by four stunning spells without warning by a group of Aurors, Poppy Pomfrey furiously insisted that they wouldn't have stood a chance in an actual fight.[11] During the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Minerva easily overpowered Death Eater Alecto Carrow even when she had aid from her brother, sending them desperately escaping from her spells, and survived the battle unscathed.[22] In 1998, shortly before the Battle of Hogwarts, she proved herself capable of not only matching Severus Snape in a fierce duel, quickly and easily countering all of his spells and responding with her own, but she also managed to begin to gain the upper hand sending daggers so powerful after him that he was forced to take refuge behind a shield of armour when he couldn't counter her spell. With aid from Pomona Sprout and Filius Flitwick, she swiftly forced Snape to flee from the school by jumping out of a classroom window and flying through the grounds. Even without them, her ability to make Snape unable to counter one of her spells showed Minerva alone could have probably eventually defeated Snape (although it must also be noted that Snape wasn't fighting to kill her). Minerva emerged as one of the survivors of the Battle of Hogwarts and most likely defeated many Death Eaters given her previous results in duels. Alongside Horace Slughorn and Kingsley Shacklebolt, she even duelled Voldemort himself to a stalemate and they were only overpowered when Voldemort's rage of Bellatrix's death caused his magic to explode, although it must be noted that Voldemort was wielding the Elder Wand at the time without having achieved mastery over it and Harry's loving sacrifice was weakening the power of Voldemort's spells.[12] It should also be noted, in her favour, that she, Horace and Kingsley had been fighting Death Eaters for hours before facing Voldemort, whereas Voldemort had only just entered battle. Her duelling knowledge remained even as she grew older, with her instructing members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force how to improve their sight and teamwork.[51] She was also incredibly skilled in manipulating and using her environment to her advantage in battle, which made her an extremely formidable opponent in duels. Her most impressive uses of this came in the duel with Snape, where she utilised the torches on the walls to make a fiery whirlwind, and at the beginning of the Battle of Hogwarts, when she brought the various desks and chairs to life, leading them into battle against her Death Eater opponents.[12]

Transfiguration: Minerva was taught Transfiguration by Albus Dumbledore, showing an unusually high level of talent in the subject even at a young age. With guidance from her teacher Albus Dumbledore, she was skilled enough to achieve the Animagus transformation at the young age of seventeen, a highly advanced and challenging process that could be disastrous if gotten wrong. Her record was so impressive that upon finishing her seventh year, she was awarded the “Most Promising Newcomer Award” by Transfiguration Today. Upon returning to Hogwarts to teach, she was offered a job as Professor of Transfiguration, under Head of Department, Albus Dumbledore. [1] Her mastery, skill and power in this immensely difficult branch of magic meant she took over the job as Head of Transfiguration upon Dumbledore’s promotion to Headmaster, a job title she retained until she herself became Headmaster in 1998. She would later regard it as “some of the most complex and dangerous” magic taught at Hogwarts.[3] As an adult, her skills in Transfiguration were known to be exceptional, Voldemort himself respecting her skills given that she was kept on as Head of Transfiguration even when he controlled the school, despite her allegiance to Dumbledore making her a prime target. Minerva was therefore phenomenally accomplished in all branches of transfiguration, including Conjuration, Vanishment, Transformation and Untransfiguration. She could perform advanced transfiguration spells with just a quick flick of her wand, for example untransfiguring Draco Malfoy back into human form, which she did simply by pointing her wand at him.[50] Like Dumbledore, she seemed especially proficient at conjuration. For example, she was effortlessly able to conjure three chairs at once non-verbally for herself, Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley in Dumbledore’s office,[11] with a simple wave of her wand; silver rope and silver nets as restraints for the Carrow siblings;[12] conjuring a large fan out of thin air to "waft" Nearly Headless Nick to the Hospital Wing,[19] conjure flames[19] and also to effortlessly conjure a snake from the end of her wand.[52] In 1992, when Harry and Ron had to eat in Snape's office, she transfigured a plate of sandwiches that would automatically refill itself.[19] Like Dumbledore, she was highly skilled at using Transfiguration in battle, easily vanishing a massive black snake Professor Snape had sent at her in their brief duel, disintegrating it almost immediately into smoke without saying a word.[12] From this smoke, she quickly turned it into a swarm of pursuing daggers, which she directed back at Snape, who was forced to hide behind a suit of armour to avoid it.[12] At the start of the Battle of Hogwarts, she brought the various tables and chairs to life to fight the Death Eaters, in much the same way in which Dumbledore brought the statues to life in his duel with Voldemort. She was also trusted by Dumbledore to contribute to the defences of the Philosopher's Stone, which she did magnificently by enlarging an entire wizard’s chess set to giant size and bringing them to life.[3] She was also highly skilled at teaching students Transfiguration, something she did for more than four decades. Her spells in class included transforming a desk into a pig and back,[3] transforming animals into water goblets,[53] changing the colour of eyebrows, Switching Spells, conjuring snakes,[52] conjuring birds[54] and turning lovebirds into love notes for Valentine's Day.[55] Jacob's sibling remarked how easy he thought Professor McGonagall made it look, when the reality was very different, further demonstrating her talent.
McGonagall Animagus transformation
Animagus: Minerva learned how to become an Animagus under Dumbledore's tutelage during her time as a student at Hogwarts, transforming into a tabby cat at will. She often used this ability when she didn't wish to be recognised. An example of this usage was when she spied on the Dursley family before Dumbledore brought Harry to them.[3] On his notes of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, Dumbledore stated that Minerva asked him to explain that she had never abused the ability for any surreptitious purposes, setting aside legitimate business for the Order of the Phoenix (and previously the Ministry of Magic) where secrecy and concealment were imperative to survive and get information from the enemy. Minerva demonstrated her transformation to the students in their third year, which usually got applause. When Hermione Granger searched for Animagus references in her third year, she saw that her Professor was one of the few registered Animagi in the 20th century.[20]

Charms: Minerva was shown to be incredibly skilled in charm-work. She was effortlessly capable of performing many simple everyday charms non-verbally without fail, such as the Fire-Making Spell, Mending Charm,[19] Wand-Lighting Charm,[56] Freezing Spell,[8] Disarming Charm,[57] Summoning Charm[50] and Levitation Charm.[12] She was also able to successfully teach her students various charms related to transfiguration such as the Colour Change Charm,[58] Mending Charm,[59] Hardening Charm,[60] Softening Charm[61] Bird-Conjuring Charm[54] and Revelio Charm[17] in her classes. Minerva had mastered the Patronus Charm, being able to create a powerful corporeal Patronus in the form of a cat — identical to her Animagus — , being the only person seen to cast three Patronuses at once. She also was able to use her Patronus as a means of communication, as taught to her by Dumbledore. Minerva was also proficient in the use of the Piertotum Locomotor charm, describing it as one of the spells she best excelled in and favoured, using it to such a great effect that with a single use, she animated virtually all of the thousands of desks and suits of armour in order to defend Hogwarts during the final battle with Voldemort.[12] She was also able to perform a powerful Amplifying Charm, which was capable of being heard across the castle, using it to summon the other Professors to the second-floor corridor when the Heir of Slytherin took a student into the Chamber of Secrets.[62] Minerva was additionally proficient in Silencing Charms, using one to great effect to control the chaos in the corridor where Justin Finch-Flecthley had just been found petrified. She non-verbally silenced the corridor using her wand, setting off a "loud bang", restoring order to the corridor.[63]
Defence Against the Dark Arts: Minerva was exceptionally experienced and accomplished in defensive magic as she fought in the two wizarding wars and survived, having defeated powerful dark wizards and witches in process and even surviving a duel with Voldemort himself.[12] During her early years in teaching, Minerva effortlessly undid the effects of the dark charm Oscausi Leta Lestrange placed on a Gryffindor girl.[14] While not as powerful as her predecessor, it was nevertheless the case that Minerva, upon being appointed Headmistress of Hogwarts by the Board of Governors, as all those that had held the post before her, was charged with handling the protective enchantments surrounding the school, which, considering her still considerable abilities, she likely still did so very well. She was able to teach how to greatly increase the strength of the Protection Charm of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force.[51]
Dark Arts: Whilst she did not practise the Dark Arts, Minerva was surprisingly capable in the field. She was able to successfully cast an effective Imperius Curse on Amycus Carrow,[12] a remarkable feat as the Unforgivable Curses require both heartfelt intent and power in order to be effectively cast. She seemed to have no trouble performing standard dark charms, casting the spell Oscausi on the girl who had had it cast previously on her by Leta[14] and the Knockback Jinx in a failed attempt to free Ben Copper from the Cursed ice (openly noting she used it when it was previously unleashed upon the school successfully).[16] She was particularly proficient in the use of Deterioration Hex, enough so to teach them to the members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force.[51]
Elemental magic aptitude: Much like her mentor, Dumbledore, Minerva seemed to be exceptionally capable with manipulating fire. When freeing Ben Copper from the Cursed ice, she along with Snape were able to free him with the Fire-Making Spell while avoiding burning his flesh. When duelling the extremely powerful Severus Snape, she easily manipulated the fire from the torches into a fiery whirlwind first and easily blasted to smoke the fiery serpent he transformed her attack into.[12]</p></html>
