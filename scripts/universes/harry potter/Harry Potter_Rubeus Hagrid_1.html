Statute of Secrecy Task Force
Professor Rubeus Hagrid (b. 6 December 1928) was an English half-giant wizard, son of Mr Hagrid and the giantess Fridwulfa, and elder half-brother of the giant Grawp.

Hagrid attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1940 and was sorted into Gryffindor house. In Hagrid's third year, he was framed by Tom Riddle for the crime of opening the Chamber of Secrets and using his pet Acromantula to attack several Muggle-born students and eventually killing one of them. Though Hagrid's wand was snapped and he was expelled, he was trained as gamekeeper of Hogwarts and allowed to live on the school grounds at the request of Albus Dumbledore.

In 1991, Hagrid was given the task of reintroducing Harry Potter to the wizarding world. In 1993, Hagrid would assume the post of Care of Magical Creatures professor after the retirement of Professor Silvanus Kettleburn. As a member of both the original and the re-instated Order of the Phoenix, Hagrid fought in several battles of the First and the Second Wizarding Wars, including the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998. By 2017, he was still living, and presumably still teaching and tending to his gamekeeping duties at Hogwarts, inviting Harry's son Albus Severus for tea when he joined the school as Harry informed him at the station, just as Hagrid had done for his father, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.

Biography
Early life (1928-1940)
Hagrid and his father
Hagrid was born on 6 December 1928 to Mr Hagrid, a wizard, and Fridwulfa, a giantess, and grew up in the West Country of England, near the Forest of Dean, where he acquired his distinctive accent.

When Hagrid was about three, his mother returned to her Giant colony, leaving his father to raise him alone. Hagrid said he had very few memories of his mother from his childhood, but remembered his father fondly; as a half-giant, he overtook his father in size by the age of six, and amused the "tiny" wizard by picking him up and setting him on top of a dresser when Hagrid was annoyed with him. Later, when talking to Harry, Ron, and Hermione about the death of his mother, Hagrid admitted that she was not a great mother at all. He grew to an height of eleven and a half feet tall, immense by human standards but very small by giant standards.

Hogwarts years (1940-1943)
Riddle finds Rubeus Hagrid keeping a young Aragog in the school dungeons, in 1943
Hagrid's father was thrilled when his son was accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where Hagrid began his education in 1940 in which he was Sorted into Gryffindor House. During his third year, Hagrid acquired one in what would be a long line of dangerous pets: a young Acromantula, which he named Aragog. 

That same year, fifth-year student Tom Marvolo Riddle, who would go on to become Lord Voldemort, opened the Chamber of Secrets and unleashed another monster, which Riddle used to attack and petrify a number of Muggle-born students until he finally caused the death of a girl named Myrtle Warren. When the school was threatened with closing, a consequence highly undesired by Riddle, the boy found out about Aragog and turned Hagrid in as the culprit. It likely didn't help that Hagrid had a habit of getting into trouble every other week: he'd once tried raising werewolf cubs under his bed and was known to sneak off into the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls (both of these statements were likely exaggerations on Riddle's part however). Hagrid protected Aragog and helped him flee to the Forbidden Forest; however, he was shortly thereafter expelled from Hogwarts, a fate that he was relieved that his father never knew of, having died during Hagrid's second year.

Following his expulsion, the Ministry of Magic forbade Hagrid from practising magic and destroyed his wand. The then-Transfiguration teacher Albus Dumbledore, who was convinced that Hagrid was innocent, nonetheless convinced then-Headmaster, Armando Dippet, to have Hagrid trained for the job of Gamekeeper and allow the orphan to remain a resident of the school. Hagrid continued to do magic using his pink umbrella, which most likely contained the broken fragments of his wand or perhaps even his entire wand intact. It may have been reconstructed for him by Dumbledore using the Elder Wand, although he only would have done this some years later, because he did not procure the Elder Wand until 1945.

First Wizarding War (1970-1981)
Hagrid as a member of the original Order
Sometime in the 1970s, Hagrid joined the original Order of the Phoenix. It was a secret organisation founded by Albus Dumbledore to oppose Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. The Order was constructed after Voldemort returned to England from abroad and started his campaign to take over the Ministry of Magic and persecute Muggles and Muggle-borns. 

Voldemort's first reign of terror lasted years and turned friends against each other. It was said that during this time it was difficult to trust one another, as you did not know for sure who had gone over to the dark side, partly due to the Death Eaters' access to the Imperius Curse. The Order worked with the Ministry to oppose the Dark Lord and his followers, even allowing Aurors the use of Unforgivable Curses. Voldemort also had a number of magical dark creatures under his command as well, such as giants.

Hagrid delivering Harry Potter to 4 Privet Drive
At the abrupt end of the First Wizarding War, Albus Dumbledore sent Hagrid to rescue a one-year-old Harry Potter from the ruins of his house in Godric's Hollow, after Lord Voldemort murdered both James and Lily Potter in 1981. Using Sirius Black's motorcycle, he brought Harry Potter to Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall, who were waiting to deliver the boy to his only remaining family — Lily's Muggle elder sister, Petunia, and her husband Vernon Dursley. Hagrid was very sad at the thought of James and Lily Potter being dead.

Between the wars (1981-1995)
Meeting Jacob's sibling
Early in the 1984–1985 school year, Hagrid rescued a student from Devil's Snare. He also met Ben Copper. Around this time, he also got a puppy.

Shortly before one of his birthdays, Hagrid lost one of his pets, and stopped being as cheerful as he usually was. Around this time, Dumbledore recruited Jacob's sibling to help throw him a huge birthday party to cheer him up and show just how much everyone appreciated him.

At some point before this, he saved a seventh year's life, made a first year feel welcome at Hogwarts, and baked Rock Cakes to cheer up a third year.

During the 1987–1988 school year, Hagrid's hut became infested with Bundimuns. Jacob's sibling helped Hagrid clear out the infestation with the Scouring Charm, for which Hagrid was extremely grateful.

Meeting Harry Potter
Hagrid giving Harry a birthday cake
After Harry was accepted to Hogwarts in 1991, Hagrid was given the task of finding Harry, as Harry's uncle Vernon was doing everything in his power to prevent his nephew from receiving his Hogwarts acceptance letter. On Harry's eleventh birthday, Hagrid found the Dursleys and Harry in an isolated Hut-on-the-Rock, and accidentally broke the door down from the force of his knocking. Vernon threatened him with a gun, only for Hagrid to contemptuously seize the gun and twist it into a knot.

Hagrid gave Harry a birthday cake and revealed to Harry that he was a wizard, and several times came close to losing his temper at Vernon due to repeated insults, but lost it entirely when Vernon called Albus Dumbledore, a "crackpot old fool". In retaliation, Hagrid attempted to turn Harry's spoiled cousin, Dudley, into a pig, but only managed to give the boy a pig's tail. Hagrid credited this to Dudley being "so much like a pig already, there was not much left to do".

Harry and Hagrid visit Diagon Alley in search of school supplies
Once it was confirmed that Harry would be attending Hogwarts, after Hagrid decidedly ignored the Dursleys' protests, he helped Harry find his bearings in the magical world by taking him to Diagon Alley, through the Leaky Cauldron, to buy his school necessities. While in Diagon Alley, Hagrid took Harry to Gringotts Wizarding Bank to withdraw some funds from the Potters' vault, and to retrieve the Philosopher's Stone from high-security Vault 713, to be transported to Hogwarts for even safer keeping. Hagrid also bought Hedwig, a snowy white owl, for Harry's eleventh birthday. He comforted Harry about his upcoming attendance at Hogwarts school and provided him with a ticket detailing the date, time and place that he would need to catch the Hogwarts Express.

Protecting the Philosopher's Stone
Hagrid and the stranger at the Hog's Head
When news got out that Vault 713 had been broken into (shortly after it had been emptied by Hagrid), Harry, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger quickly realised that whatever Hagrid had moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts was being hidden in the off-limits third-floor corridor and guarded by a massive three-headed dog. Hagrid refused to disclose what the vault had contained, but he mentioned that the secret was "between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel". In the spring of 1992, Hagrid met a hooded man (Quirinus Quirrell in disguise) at the Hog's Head and was enticed to play a game of cards when the mysterious person bet a dragon egg. Assuming the man was a dragon dealer and fellow dangerous creature enthusiast, and under the influence of a fair amount of mead, Hagrid was convinced to divulge details about Fluffy, the three-headed dog Hagrid had lent to Dumbledore to help guard the Philosopher's Stone.

The dragon egg preparing to hatch
Harry, knowing that Hagrid had always wanted a dragon and thinking it far too much a coincidence that a man just happened to bring a rare dragon egg to the local pub, questioned Hagrid alongside Ron and Hermione about what had exactly happened during the card game. This time, Hagrid let slip to the trio what he had told the hooded man: the secret to calming Fluffy was that one simply had to play music and Fluffy would fall asleep. This allowed the trio to pursue the potential thief.

Once the dragon egg hatched, Hagrid lovingly named the hatchling Norbert. Hagrid was initially blind to the chaos that the hatchling caused, but eventually, Harry, Ron, and Hermione convinced him to allow Norbert to be taken to a dragon sanctuary by friends of Ron's brother, Charlie, who worked with dragons. After learning that Voldemort had attempted to steal the Stone using the information Hagrid gave him while drunk, Hagrid was distraught with guilt, but Harry assured Hagrid that he did not blame him. As an apology, Hagrid spent the time that Harry was unconscious sending off owls to some of his parents' old school friends, assembling an album full of wizarding photos of Harry's parents for him.

Imprisonment in Azkaban
Fudge visiting Hagrid in his hut in order to take him to Azkaban
During the 1992–1993 school year, Hagrid showed public disdain for the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart, although he never did so for any other teachers. In 1993 Hagrid was sent to the wizarding prison, Azkaban, when the Chamber of Secrets was re-opened. It was assumed he was the one who reopened the Chamber because his expulsion from Hogwarts was for the same occurrence. Even with Dumbledore backing Hagrid, Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge insisted on taking Hagrid anyway. So on the same night Dumbledore was asked to step down as Headmaster by the school governors, Hagrid was escorted to Azkaban. However, he was able to help Harry and Ron solve the mystery surrounding the Chamber, by advising them to "follow the spiders."

Hagrid during his short stint in Azkaban
Following the spiders led the boys to Aragog, the Acromantula believed to have attacked students during the 1942-1943 school year, and his family. Though Harry and Ron barely escaped the encounter with their lives, they managed to obtain some valuable information over the course of their conversation with Aragog: the monster within the Chamber had nothing to do with Hagrid, and the girl it had killed in the 1940s had died in a bathroom. Harry was thus able to find the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets, slay the basilisk within, and destroy Tom Riddle's diary. As it turned out, the actual perpetrator had been the person who had turned Hagrid in in 1943. Hagrid was exonerated and released from Azkaban. He returned to Hogwarts at three o'clock in the morning and joined in the ongoing celebration of the closure of what had been a terrifying incident, accidentally knocking Harry and Ron face-first into their plates of trifle when he cuffed them on the shoulders.

Protecting Buckbeak
Hagrid's first Care of Magical Creatures lesson
In the 1993–1994 school year, Hagrid became a professor of the Care of Magical Creatures. For his first lesson, Hagrid taught his third-year students about hippogriffs. After explaining the proper way to greet a hippogriff and choosing Harry to demonstrate, Draco Malfoy caused trouble by insulting the hippogriff Buckbeak, even though Hagrid had just warned the class to treat the creatures with respect. Buckbeak attacked Draco, and the Ministry of Magic issued an order for Buckbeak's execution after a hearing in which Lucius Malfoy's pull at the Ministry was demonstrated, the incident also damaging Hagrid's self-confidence; later lessons focused on tamer creatures like flobberworms. Buckbeak's attack on Malfoy was later used during the Triwizard Tournament by Rita Skeeter to give Hagrid a very bad reputation. 

The night of Buckbeak's intended execution
An appeal took place on 6 June 1994, but this was to no avail, and Buckbeak was to be executed at sunset that night. Before the execution, Harry, Ron, and Hermione visited Hagrid to console him, and they left just before the executioner arrived. Knowing Buckbeak's position, and the exact timing of the start of the execution, Harry and Hermione were able to save Buckbeak by going back in time with Hermione's Time-Turner, allowing them to rescue Buckbeak after the Ministry team sent to execute him had confirmed his location while Hagrid and Dumbledore were under observation, thus guaranteeing that neither would be blamed for Buckbeak's rescue/escape. Delighted at the escape of his beloved pet, Hagrid spent the whole night celebrating with a large bottle of what may have been Firewhisky.

Triwizard Tournament
Hagrid teaching his fourth year Care of Magical Creatures class
During the 1994–1995 school year, the Triwizard Tournament was held at Hogwarts. Students from the Durmstrang Institute and the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic attended Hogwarts starting in October, and Hagrid was tasked with taking care of the Beauxbatons' Abraxans, which drank only single malt whiskey and required forceful handling. Over the course of the year, he performed various tasks essential to the workings of the tournament: in November, he helped Charles Weasley take care of the dragons used in the First Task of the tournament, which he showed Harry at the suggestion of Professor Moody (who was really Barty Crouch Jnr); he also bred Blast-Ended Skrewts as a project for his fourth years, which were to be used in the Third task of the tournament.

Hagrid at the Yule ball dancing with Madam Maxime
Throughout the year, Hagrid and Olympe Maxime, the half-giantess headmistress of Beauxbatons, had a budding romantic relationship, which included dancing during the Yule Ball. Hagrid confided in her his life story, revealing to her that he is a half-giant, assuming her to be one as well because of her massive size. She was offended by the insinuations that she was part giant, and left him heartbroken.

Rita Skeeter, in her Animagus beetle form, overheard Hagrid's confession and reported it in the Daily Prophet. After receiving a fair amount of hate mail, Hagrid hid in the seclusion of his hut, while Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank temporarily took over Care of Magical Creatures, and attempted to resign from his position as Professor. Dumbledore refused to accept Hagrid's resignation, and he was eventually convinced to come back and teach by Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest with Ron and Hermione
Before the events of the third task, Hagrid was called by Dumbledore to escort Harry back to the castle after he and Viktor Krum encountered Barty Crouch Snr at the edge of the Forbidden Forest. When it appeared that Krum had been attacked by Crouch (really it was his son hiding in the trees), Igor Karkaroff accused Dumbledore of treachery and spat at his foot. This caused Hagrid to lose his temper with Karkaroff and pin him to a tree, demanding an apology. He was talked down by Dumbledore, and saw Harry back to his common room, reprimanding him for being in such a situation and warning him against the foreign students.

Following the return of Lord Voldemort, Hagrid attempted to comfort Harry after his ordeal and admitted that he had believed Voldemort would have returned eventually, echoing something he had told Harry at their first meeting; that Voldemort did not have enough humanity left to die. He admitted to Harry and his friends that he and Madam Maxime had important business to attend to over the holidays but refused to say more. He also imparted some wisdom to Harry, helping him accept that what would come would come.

Second Wizarding War (1995-1998)
Mission to the Giant colony
Hagrid and Madam Maxime on their shared mission
When Albus Dumbledore learned of Voldemort's rebirth, he sent Hagrid and Madame Maxime as envoys to the giant colonies of north-eastern Minsk, in the hopes of dissuading the giants from joining Lord Voldemort's side in the coming war. Bearing gifts of eternal Gubraithian Fire and a goblin-made battle helmet, they eventually won over the Gurg, Karkus.

However, two Death Eaters that Voldemort had sent on the same mission engineered an uprising. This uprising was led by the giant Golgomath, who beheaded Karkus and usurped his position. Golgomath then ordered his subordinates to attack Hagrid and Maxime and forced them to flee. Golgomath was far more keen towards the Death Eaters and got on well with Walden Macnair, both of whom enjoyed killing and had shared a dislike toward Hagrid. Hagrid subsequently found that his mother had died years ago, and the existence of his half-brother Grawp, who was having a hard time within his colony as he was considerably smaller than most giants. Hagrid insisted on bringing Grawp back to Hogwarts due to this and presumably to prevent Grawp from being enslaved by Voldemort alongside the other giants. Grawp, however, was highly resistant to the idea and had a general tendency to be violent. Thus Hagrid and Grawp made the journey back to Scotland separately from Madam Maxime.

Living with Grawp
Hagrid telling Harry, Ron, and Hermione of his negotiations with the giants
About halfway through the school year, Hagrid returned from his mission for Dumbledore with his half-brother, Grawp. In 1995, Dolores Umbridge was brought in as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, and later became the first and only Hogwarts High Inquisitor. Hagrid barely excused himself for his long absence from Umbridge's tyrannical questioning and was surprised that he would be subjected to her inspection soon afterwards.

Hagrid resumed his teaching post, beginning with a lesson about Thestrals. Despite their rather off-putting appearance and the inability of most of the class to see them, Hermione found these lessons far more useful than Hagrid's typical classes. Regardless, early in 1996, Professor Umbridge put Hagrid on probation after supposedly finding his lessons unsatisfactory by her standards, despite Hermione's every effort to make sure Hagrid's curriculum was geared toward preparing students for the upcoming O.W.L.s. Umbridge's harsh judgement was largely due to her distaste for "half-breeds," and it was only the resistance she met from Headmaster Dumbledore that kept her from firing Hagrid altogether. When confronted by the trio about this revelation, Hagrid attempted to make light of it (nearly concussing Professor Vector with his fist as she went past) but was consistently jumpy and nervous at the prospect of being sacked.

Hagrid introduces Grawp, his half-brother, to Harry and Hermione
However, once Dumbledore was forced to leave in order to shield Harry from punishment for establishing Dumbledore's Army, Hagrid feared that he would be driven out by the new Headmistress Umbridge. In preparation for this, he introduced Harry and Hermione to Grawp. Grawp took an immediate liking to Hermione, whom he called "Hermy," and Hagrid asked the two of them, along with Ron, to take care of Grawp in his absence.

Upon Dumbledore's departure, general chaos reigned within the school, as the students became determined to make Umbridge's job as hard for her as possible; Lee Jordan even released a couple of nifflers into her office, for which she blamed Hagrid. Umbridge finally attempted to have Hagrid forcibly removed from the premises, and possibly arrested, when she brought several Ministry officials to his hut in the middle of the night so as not to cause a commotion with the students due to their earlier presence at Sybill Trelawney's dismissal. Hagrid refused to go quietly and took on the officials, whose attempts to Stun him proved fruitless thanks to his giant blood. Fang came to his master's aid until one of the wizards Stunned him, prompting Hagrid to lift the culprit bodily from the ground and throw the unfortunate soul ten feet away.

Hagrid visiting a wheelchair bound McGonagall
While all of this was being witnessed by the trio's Astronomy exam, Professor Minerva McGonagall came charging out of the castle demanding that Hagrid be left alone and, in a disgustingly cowardly move by the officials, was seriously injured after being hit by four simultaneous Stunning Spells without warning. Enraged at this dishonourable conduct and the injury of his friend and colleague, Hagrid knocked out two more of his assailants before fleeing with his unconscious dog. Aurors were sent to search for Hagrid, but he successfully evaded capture by hiding in the same cave that had previously proved a useful hiding place for Sirius Black. Once Dumbledore was reinstated as the Headmaster of Hogwarts and Umbridge permanently removed from the school, Hagrid was welcomed back to his post.

Aragog's funeral
Hagrid accompanied the trio and some members of the Weasley family to Diagon Alley as security for Harry, as these were dark and dangerous times. When Hagrid found out that none of his sixth-year Gryffindor students chose to continue past their O.W.L. level of Care of Magical Creatures, he initially misinterpreted this as a reflection of his students not liking him, as opposed to his questionable teaching.

Hagrid eventually came to forgive Harry, Ron, and Hermione, understanding that their N.E.W.T. classes were difficult with massive work loads (and after Hermione confirmed that they could not have managed his classes with Time-Turners, as they had all been smashed during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries); his anger abated completely when he was overcome with worry about the failing health of Aragog.

Hagrid at Aragog's funeral with Harry and Professor Slughorn
When Aragog died in 1997, he asked Harry, Ron and Hermione to help him bury the dead Acromantula's body, though the heightened security around the castle with Voldemort's confirmed return made that difficult. Ultimately, spurred on by Felix Felicis, Harry went to Hagrid's anyway and met Professor Horace Slughorn on the way. Hagrid, along with Harry and Professor Slughorn, buried Aragog near the pumpkin patch, and then gave him a tearful salute involving a good deal of mead. Harry used the situation to his advantage in retrieving a memory of Tom Riddle asking about Horcruxes from a very inebriated Slughorn.

Battle of the Astronomy Tower
Hagrid carrying Dumbledore's body during his funeral
During the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Albus Dumbledore was killed by Severus Snape (on Dumbledore's orders). Near the end of the battle, he confronted Death Eater Thorfinn Rowle who attempted to curse him only to realise that Hagrid's giant blood protected him. Rowle proceeded to set Hagrid's Hut on fire while the Death Eaters were fleeing the school grounds. Hagrid and Harry Potter, who had chased Snape out of the castle, put it out before the hut burned down. Hagrid was grief-stricken about Dumbledore's death, having been one of his strongest supporters. Hagrid carried Dumbledore's body to be interred at his funeral, almost breaking down several times, and later Hagrid and Grawp were seen comforting one another.

Battle of the Seven Potters
Hagrid and Harry Potter along with the others right before the sky battle
Hagrid was among the thirteen members of the Order of the Phoenix, led by Alastor Moody, that made up the Advance Guard. The Advance Guard was in charge of moving Harry Potter out of the Dursley home before his seventeenth birthday; the plan to do so included having five of Harry's friends (Ron, Hermione, Fleur Delacour, and Fred and George Weasley), as well as Mundungus Fletcher, impersonate Harry to act as decoys, with an Order of the Phoenix member protecting each of them, and fly to six safe houses before taking portkeys to the Burrow. Knowing that any Death Eaters watching out for them would assume the most skilled Auror would be moving with the real Harry, Alastor Moody took Mundungus Fletcher, while Hagrid was given the important task of protecting the real Harry in the side-car of Sirius Black's motorcycle.

Voldemort duelling against Harry Potter over Little Whinging
Arthur Weasley had helped Hagrid make several adjustments to the bike, including adding a button that produced dragon's fire, one that produced a net, and another that produced a solid wall, all of which materialised behind the bike by expanding out of its exhaust pipe. As it turned out, the Death Eaters had found out about the plan to move Harry earlier than rumoured (as the Order had purposely released false information about moving him at a later date) and the seven Harrys, with their Order protectors, were ambushed.

Hagrid was able to keep the Death Eaters at bay with the help of the modifications on his bike and Harry's wand-work, but when Harry discovered one of the attacking Death Eaters was an imperiused Stanley Shunpike, he made the unusual move of using the Disarming Charm. As he had done the same unexpected thing in Little Hangleton graveyard in 1995, Harry was identified as the real deal, and Voldemort came after him personally. In the struggle that followed, the motorcycle was torn apart and Hagrid dove off the bike at a Death Eater, falling a great distance to the ground. He survived, however, as did Harry, when it turned out they had fallen into the protection surrounding the Tonks house.

Nymphadora Tonks' parents, Ted and Andromeda Tonks, healed their injuries, as Hagrid comforted Harry over the death of his beloved pet owl Hedwig, saying she had lived a "good old life." Since Hagrid had a history of having trouble keeping secrets, Fleur Delacour suspected Hagrid was the one who had unintentionally leaked the date of the intended move, although Harry refused to blame anyone even before that was revealed not to be the case. That same night, Hagrid and all the other members of the Order mourned the death of Alastor Moody, who had been targeted immediately by Voldemort, exactly as Moody anticipated.

Hagrid attended Bill's and Fleur's wedding
During the summer of 1997, Hagrid was present at Harry's seventeenth birthday party. He gave him a mokeskin pouch which held objects retrievable only by the owner. Hagrid also attended Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding, accidentally sitting in the wrong spot (and destroying a number of chairs) before finding the correct place to sit. During the wedding, Kingsley Shacklebolt warned the crowd that Voldemort had taken over the Ministry. It is unknown if Hagrid fought the Death Eaters that attacked the Burrow.

Hiding
Once back at Hogwarts, Hagrid continued his job as gatekeeper and Professor of Care of Magical Creatures. At the request of new headmaster, Severus Snape, Hagrid was placed in charge of students who had been assigned detention. Detention with Hagrid consisted of work in the Forbidden Forest, which was far safer than detention with Amycus and Alecto Carrow. Later that year, Hagrid narrowly escaped arrest after holding a Support Harry Potter party in his hut. He then went into hiding, presumably in the mountains, with his half-brother, Grawp. His escape was reported hours later on the radio programme Potterwatch.

Battle of Hogwarts

Hagrid returned to Hogwarts with Grawp for the final battle. He rushed out onto the grounds to prevent injury being done to the Acromantula who had swarmed out of the Forbidden Forest and were climbing up the walls of the school. He was taken captive by the Death Eaters. When Harry appeared in the forest Hagrid shouted for him to run, though was silenced by Rowle. After Harry's apparent death at the Dark Lord's hands, Hagrid was forced to carry Harry back to the castle. As the supposed "victory party" approached the castle, Hagrid rebuked the centaurs for refusing to involve themselves in the fight but was eventually reduced to sobs over the loss of Harry.

When fighting resumed at the arrival of reinforcements, which included Buckbeak and Hagrid's herd of tame Thestrals, as well as the centaurs, Hagrid threw Walden Macnair against the wall of the Great Hall, presumably recognising him from both Buckbeak's trial and the mission to recruit the giants. Hagrid was among the first to approach and congratulate Harry after Voldemort's ultimate defeat. He was seen in the Great Hall among the other survivors of the battle.

Later life (1998-)

Hagrid was still working at Hogwarts by 2017, at 89 years old, owing to the natural longevity of wizardkind, which also meant that he would likely have an extremely long life by Muggle standards. He invited Harry and Ginny's youngest son, Albus, to his hut for tea, just as he had done during Harry's first year. Hagrid never married, despite his reciprocated attraction to Madame Maxime, as she was ultimately too sophisticated for them to be a good match.

In 2019, Hagrid led the members of the then recently established Statute of Secrecy Task Force seeking a career as Magizoologists, welcoming them by saying that he could sense they were going to sign in as he was able to see that they shared a curious spirit and ensuring them that, although being a Magizoologist was far from easy, they could succeed if they had the spirit to withstand the difficult trials and could recover. He first took them to the Diagon Alley to buy several robes and other essential pieces of equipment required to handle beasts and creatures for increased durability before proceeding to successfully teach the Stamina Charm, (despite his own being "less-than-perfect"), and allowed them to help him handle several live Fire Crabs. The primary takeaway they got from this, however, was a boost in their tolerance of pain. He also gave those who chose to became an Auror an elective to raise their defences against Beasts.

Physical description
Rubeus Hagrid
Hagrid was born to a wizard father and a giant mother, making him a half-giant. As a half-giant, Hagrid possessed great physical strength and endurance, including a resilience against some spells, though his ability to withstand spells was not as great as that of full giants. He was about twice as tall as an average man, standing at eleven feet, six inches tall (too big for an ordinary-sized broomstick) and three times as wide, with a long mane of shaggy black hair and a beard that covered most of his face. Hagrid's hands were as big as dustbin lids and his feet in their boots were like baby dolphins. He had dark eyes that glinted like black beetles. Hagrid's size often makes it difficult for him to enter rooms or buildings that are designed for ordinary sized people or not built with airy or grand designs, such as him not being able to fit easily into the Hospital Wing or the Burrow yet having no trouble moving in the Great Hall.

He often wore an exceptionally large moleskin overcoat with several pockets that held many things, though that sometimes caused him to spend a lot of time searching for what he wanted to find. Objects within the pockets have included any number of items, such as mouldy dog biscuits, the key to Harry Potter's Gringotts vault, peppermint humbugs, a squashy package of sausages, a copper kettle, a fire poker, wizard money, a birthday cake, birthday presents, a dirty spotted handkerchief, slug pellets, and a living owl. Hagrid's clothing is largely hand-made due to the descriptions of his clothing as being crafted of animal skin and far too large for a full-blooded or non-hybridised human being. 

Despite his love for beasts, Hagrid was allergic to cats.

Personality and traits
Hagrid was an incredibly warm, kind-hearted man, and would often forget his exceptional size and strength when patting people on the back. Another of Hagrid's greatest traits was his courage. He was also very loyal to his friends and was ready to defend them or fight for them if necessary. He was particularly loyal to Albus Dumbledore, describing him as a "great man". He would react with fury if anyone dared insult the headmaster and wouldn't hesitate to magically assault or rough up the offender. However, despite his loyalty, Hagrid was not good at keeping secrets and accidentally told Quirinus Quirrell, Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Granger, the secret of how to get past his three headed dog, Fluffy, which all four of them used to get through to the Philosopher's Stone. This was again shown when he revealed his half-giant status to Olympe Maxime, which Harry, Ron and Rita Skeeter all overheard, with the latter exposing it to the wizarding world by an article in the Daily Prophet.

Hagrid had a great love of magical creatures, including cross-breeds such as the Blast-Ended Skrewt, and had a better relationship with most of the inhabitants of the Forbidden Forest than most people, including the centaurs, though he had little interest in tame magical creatures due to the lack of a challenge they offered. Despite this, he did show a good understanding of such creatures when he returned to his post as Care of Magical Creatures teacher, continuing lessons on unicorns after Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank. Unfortunately he tended to overlook the dangers behind certain magical creatures, such as his dragon Norbert, and his pet Acromantula Aragog, which was alleged by Tom Riddle to be the monster of Slytherin in 1943, resulting in Hagrid's expulsion from the school. Hagrid never spoke about why he was expelled and would ignore any inquiries about it. Hagrid was fond of creatures in general and seemed to want to own any creature was even slightly fierce — his desires included a warthog and any dragon that he could get his hands on. He tended to give his pets ironic names, such as Fluffy for a vicious three-headed dog, and Fang, an affectionate Boarhound.

Hagrid had a fondness for drinks and was sometimes known to be aggressive, especially when people insulted or dishonourably attacked those he cared about. After Vernon Dursley claimed that James and Lily Potter deserved their fates and called Albus Dumbledore a "crackpot old fool", Hagrid threatened Vernon with his pink umbrella. When Igor Karkaroff accused Dumbledore of treachery and spat at his feet, Hagrid lifted Karkaroff off the ground and slammed him against a tree, roaring at him to apologise to Dumbledore. When some Aurors stunned Fang and Minerva McGonagall, he was so outraged and disgusted that he attacked the Aurors, furiously denouncing them as cowards and when he was younger, threw Tom Riddle to the ground when he framed Aragog of opening the Chamber of Secrets.

Despite this, Hagrid was a very sensitive person and was known to burst into tears when someone close to him was harmed or killed, or when he felt responsible for something that put his friends in peril, such as drunkenly telling Quirinus Quirrell how to get past his giant three headed dog, Fluffy.
His courage also concealed a deep fear of rejection and insecurity which was notably shown when he isolated himself after he was revealed as a half-giant and he attempted to resign from his position as the Care of Magical Creatures teacher until he was convinced otherwise by Dumbledore, Harry, Ron and Hermione.

When he was teaching, he also had a tendency to lose his self-confidence if his classes were disrupted such as when Buckbeak attacked Draco Malfoy, or if he believed people disliked his classes, which he mistook for people disliking him. Although he overlooked certain dangers, Hagrid also avoided doing anything against the Wizarding Law when he was under pressure such as when he avoided setting Buckbeak free, fearing he would be put back in Azkaban, and when he tried hard to avoid getting dangerous creatures when under probation by Dolores Umbridge.

Hagrid was also a good and caring brother to Grawp, insisting on bringing him back to Hogwarts on finding he was being picked on for his (relatively) small stature by the other giants in his colony, and hiding in the forest, despite the frequent injuries and the trouble doing so caused him.

He also enjoyed cooking for his friends. However, his tendency to mostly cook foods suitable for himself and a lack of understanding of what his friends preferred eating meant that his cooking was usually turned down politely.

Magical abilities and skills

For a man who was expelled during his third year and rarely used magic as a result, Rubeus Hagrid was a rather good wizard, being considerably advanced, with some of his abilities even comparing to the N.E.W.T.-level academical difficulty. Being a Half-Giant, he also had magical abilities which stemmed from his giant blood, such as great superhuman strength and endurance along with a certain degree of magical resistance. Hagrid's hands-on and outdoor style of living allowed him to acquire other skills such as looking after magical creatures, craftsmanship, crossbowmanship and social networking within the magical community. 

Magical aptitude: Despite having never graduated from Hogwarts and therefore not being fully trained in the magical arts as well as probably not often practising magic as he wasn't allowed to do so technically in his own admission, as he had been expelled from Hogwarts and his wand was apparently destroyed some years earlier, Hagrid's magical aptitude was clearly astonishing as he proved to be quite accomplished and skilled in magic enough that he was able to successfully conjure moderate levels of powerful magic. He was capable of performing successfully the majority of his spells using non-verbal magic via his umbrella and as his wand was apparently destroyed, he may also have been capable of wandless magic as well, both of which only extremely powerful wizards and witches proved capable of using effectively. However, Hagrid's magic was never flawless as he was the only member of the Order of the Phoenix who could not cast the extremely powerful and difficult Patronus Charm and failed to completely transfigure Dudley Dursley into a pig, although he admitted that since Dudley was already so close to being a pig with his overweight physique and eating ways, he did not need to transfigure him completely, suggesting that Hagrid may have been able to do it but just chose not to further humiliate Dudley, and repair Sirius Black's motorbike which had been heavily damaged during the Battle of the Seven Potters, though it must be noted that he was also struggling to control the motorbike and therefore he may just have been unable to exert enough magic to do so.

Transfiguration: Hagrid was at least moderately proficient in the field transfiguration, as shown in the Hut-on-the-Rock when he pulled off a partially successful transfiguration when he put a pig's tail on Dudley Dursley in a failed attempt to transfigure him into said animal. He could also perform conjuration; in 1991 he used the Fire-Making Spell, while in the Hut-on-the-Rock and in 1997 the Water-Making Spell, to put out a fire in his hut during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. This is impressive as transfiguration, especially Human Transfiguration, is considered one of the most difficult branches of magic and even experienced wizards struggle with it. In the latter case, however, Harry had to inform him of the incantation for the spell, which Hagrid's response suggested he didn't correctly memorise.
Charms: Hagrid was also accomplished with charms as he could cast a spell of his own that can enchant a boat to move on its own to a destination, which he used to transport himself and Harry back to the mainland from the Hut-on-the-Rock and used it on the Hogwarts boats to transport the first years across the Black Lake. Hagrid was skilled in the Engorgement Charm as he used it to enlarge his pumpkins to a giant size, his success impressing Hermione and Fred and George. Although he admitted to not having perfected it, he was competent enough in the Stamina Charm to successfully instruct members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force who pursued a profession as a Magizoologist how to cast them.
Non-verbal magic: Hagrid was quite skilled at using non-verbal magic, as shown when he both lit a fire non-verbally and transfigured a pig's tail on Dudley. These spells show that, even though Hagrid never graduated from Hogwarts, he had a powerful command of magic, as non-verbal magic was difficult to use (Hogwarts does not teach non-verbal magic until students are in their sixth year).</p></html>
