Newton Artemis Fido "Newt" Scamander,[2] O.M. (Second Class), (b. 24 February,[1] 1897)[2] was an English wizard, famed Magizoologist and the author of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Early in life, Scamander developed an interest in magical creatures, influenced by his mother's breeding of hippogriffs. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he was sorted into Hufflepuff House. While at Hogwarts he was sentenced to expulsion, though Albus Dumbledore, who had been his Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor, recognised his innocence, and objected strongly.

Scamander joined the Ministry of Magic, spending two years in the Office for House-Elf Relocation before joining the Beast Division. In 1918 he was commissioned by Augustus Worme of Obscurus Books to write Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The book became a best-seller, making Scamander a respected expert in the field of Magizoology. He became heavily involved in the Global wizarding war, where he bonded with Porpentina Goldstein and defied Gellert Grindelwald on three different occasions. He married Goldstein and they had at least one child.[8] By the beginning of the 1990s, he was retired and living in Dorset.

Biography
Early life (1897–1908)
Newton Artemis Fido "Newt" Scamander was born on 24 February[1] 1897[2] somewhere in England.[3] He had at least one sibling, an older brother, Theseus Scamander.[7] He developed an interest in magical creatures at an early age, as his mother was a breeder of hippogriffs. Scamander would regularly dismember Horklumps in his bedroom at age seven.[2]

Hogwarts years (1908–1913?)
Before beginning education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Newt purchased his first wand, likely from Ollivanders, and was sorted into Hufflepuff on 1 September 1908.[14] During his time at Hogwarts, he enjoyed studying magical creatures.[15] He developed a friendship with Leta Lestrange, a fellow student who shared both his interest in magical beasts, as well as his feelings of being an outsider.[15][16]

Newt and Leta caring for a raven chick
Their close friendship began in 1910 when, at age 13, Leta ran away from bullies and Professor McGonagall and hid in a cupboard. Newt was also in the cupboard nursing a raven chick. He said he was staying over the school holidays to look after the raven, and Leta (who already knew him, being in the same year as Newt), saw him plainly for the first time.[17]

Newt being taught the Boggart-Banishing Spell by Professor Albus Dumbledore
Newt attended Professor Albus Dumbledore's teaching of Boggarts. Newt's Boggart took the form of an office desk, as Newt feared the idea of being forced to work in an office job for his future career. By casting the Boggart-Banishing Spell, he changed the desk into a mechanical dragon, for which Professor Dumbledore praised him.

Newt showing Leta a Bowtruckle at Bowtruckle Island
He later comforted Leta when she was upset by her own Boggart, which was of her dead half-brother Corvus Lestrange. By then, he had befriended the Bowtruckles on the school grounds at Bowtruckle Island and gained their trust. He was the only one they would not hide from, and he studied their social lives. 

Newt was once given a month's detention for telling a Hogwarts employee by the name of Prendergast that "there are no strange creatures, only blinkered people", when the latter critically questioned his interest in magical creatures. Leta then let off a Dungbomb under the desk of the teacher to join him.

In 1913, one of Leta's experiments involving a Jarvey went too far, endangering the life of another student.[15][18] It also violated laws prohibiting the possession of this creature.[18] Rather than seeing his good friend expelled, Newt took the blame for Leta's actions, and was thus sentenced to be expelled from Hogwarts in her place.[15][19][20][21] This left Newt bitter, but still very much in love with Leta.[22] However, Albus Dumbledore, Newt's teacher at the time, argued strongly on his behalf.[18][23] It is unclear whether the expulsion was enforced or not, or if it was temporary or permanent.[24] However, he was allowed to keep his wand.[19]

Ministry employee (1914–1918)
Newt while working at the Ministry
Sometime during the First World War from 1914 to 1918, Scamander served on the Eastern Front in a confidential Ministry of Magic programme to wrangle Ukrainian Ironbellys. The programme was ultimately cancelled as the dragons only responded to Scamander and tried to eat everyone else.[25][26][27]

Scamander joined the Ministry of Magic's Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. He spent two years in the Office for House-Elf Relocation before transferring to the Beast Division, where his extensive knowledge of magical creatures led to a rapid series of promotions,[2] propelling him forward as a Magizoologist, a career choice with which the Scamander family were not very impressed.[3]

Global wizarding war (1918–1945)
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them
In 1918, Augustus Worme of Obscurus Books commissioned Scamander to write the first edition of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. As a lowly Ministry employee earning only two Sickles a week at the time, Scamander jumped at the chance for extra money and the opportunity to spend his summers travelling the world.[2]

Scamander travelled to a hundred countries across five continents while researching his book, observing many magical creatures. He learned about their abilities, gained their trust, and occasionally beat them with his travelling kettle if they got too dangerous.[2] Newt began a year-long trip to document magical creatures and their natural habitats in 1925.[28] At one point, he met a young Obscurial witch in Sudan, and although the host died, he managed to contain her Obscurus within his magically-expanded suitcase. He also visited Egypt, where, thanks to a tip-off from Albus Dumbledore, he saved an illegally imprisoned Thunderbird which he later named Frank. His last stop before travelling to the United States was Equatorial Guinea.

Visit to New York
Newt after arriving in New York
Newt Scamander  was sent to New York by Albus Dumbledore aboard the HMS Temeresi on 6 December, 1926, for what was supposed to be a brief stopover, to send a trafficked thunderbird back to its home.[29] After being searched by a customs officer and leaving the port, Newt head towards the Steen National Bank, where Mary Lou Barebone, along with her children, was preaching to the public in a rally supporting the New Salem Philanthropic Society. Intrigued, Newton pushed his way closer to the woman, accidentally brushing against an ex-Auror named Tina Goldstein as he did so. Moments later Jacob Kowalski, a No-Maj with a case full of confectionery, bumped into him, falling over Scamander's magical suitcase. Newt helped him up, and Jacob went to the bank. The confusion around Scamander caught Mary Lou's attention. Unaware that Newt was a wizard, Mary Lou spoke directly to him, asking if he was a seeker of truth, to which Newt replied that he was a more of a chaser. When she asked him if he was ready to follow her and her organisation, Newt noticed that a Niffler escaped from his suitcase, so he moved to the bank, with Tina following him out of curiosity.

Newt and Jacob watching the hatching Occamy
While searching the creature, Scamander exchanged a few sentences with Kowalski, learning about his aim to get a loan so he could start a bakery. When he noticed the Niffler robbing people and moved toward it, he unintentionally left behind an occamy egg. Kowalski picked it up, intending to give it back to the wizard. However before he could do this, he was called to talk about a loan with Gilbert Bingley. While Jacob discussed his loan, Newt was still chasing the Niffler, which jumped onto the cart to the elevator. When Jacob left the office, showing Newt the cracking egg, Scamander attracted Kowalski to himself using the Summoning Charm, after which he disapparated with him to the entrance of the bank's vault. Newt then put the newly-hatched Occamy into a suitcase, calming down the other animals as he did so. When Newt used the Unlocking Charm to get to the vault in which his Niffler had hidden, both men were discovered by Mr Bingley, who inferred that they were going to rob the bank, and activated the alarm. In response, Newt quickly immobilised him with the Full Body-Bind Curse and shook the Niffler, emptying it of the stolen money and gold. Before the armed guards entered the room, Newt Disapparated himself with the shocked Jacob to the street near the bank.

Newt with Tina and Graves
After throwing the Niffler into the suitcase, Newt apologised to Jacob for his antics, and took out his wand with the intention of removing his unwanted memories. However, before he could do this, Kowalski knocked the wizard to the ground with his case and fled. Newt tried to follow Jacob, but Tina came round the corner at the same time and, grabbing his elbow, she disapparated them to a narrow street in front of the bank. Unnerved by what she had witnessed, Tina showed Newt her old MACUSA ID card, letting him think she was "some kind of investigator", and after questioning him on why he let the creature run free, and why he did not obliviate the No-Maj, she grabbed Newt again and apparated with him near the Woolworth Building. When they entered, the building magically transformed into the headquarters of MACUSA. Newt told Tina that the reason for his visit to the United States was the purchase of an Appaloosa Puffskein, and Tina explained in response that there was a Ban on Experimental Breeding in New York and they had shut down the Appaloosa Puffskein breeder some time before. When they took the elevator to the Major Investigation Department, Goldstein tried to present Newt as a suspicious character in the middle of a meeting about the attack of an unidentified beast in the city, but Seraphina Picquery, President of MACUSA, firmly dismissed the two. Later in the Wand Permit Office where Tina was working, she asked Newt whether he has permission for a wand, but he only said that he applied for it by letter. When Percival Graves, the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, entered the cabinet, Tina told him about the events in the bank, then opened the suitcase, which supposedly belonged to Scamander - but after seeing that it contained cakes belonging to Kowalski, it became clear that Newt had accidentally taken Jacob's case instead of his own. MACUSA no longer took them seriously, but Newt and Tina realised that in the ensuing chaos of trying catch a Niffler, Kowalski must have taken the case containing the creature. Newt immediately decided to find Kowalski.

While looking for Kowalski, Newt and Tina saw a Billywig flying over their heads and a crowd of people in front of the destroyed building. Newt realised that Jacob had accidentally opened the suitcase and several creatures must have escaped, turning a small mix-up into an incident of major proportions (as magical and non-magical relations in the United States were already frail, due in part to the presence of a Muggle fanatical extremist group, containing the incident would require the intervention of MACUSA). When a drunken tramp said to a police officer that the reason of the disaster was not gas, but the huge hippopotamus-like animal, Scamander obliviated him. While the tramp joined the people insisting there had been a gas explosion, Newt ran into the damaged building. In one of the rooms, he saw the effects of his beasts: there were traces of paws, broken furniture, broken glass, a hole in the wall, an opened suitcase and Kowalski himself having been bitten by one of the creatures. Newt quickly repaired Jacob's apartment. When Tina entered the room, Newt found a Murtlap and put him into the suitcase, and tried again to erase Jacob's memory. Tina did not let this happen, explaining that they now needed him as a witness, but as Jacob showed signs of injury, Tina grabbed both men and disapparated, unaware that a Niffler was still there.

Newt climbing into his case
Newt with Jacob were brought by Tina to her apartment and introduced them to her sister, Queenie Goldstein, who eagerly cooked a meal for them. After dinner, when Tina showed them to a room they could sleep in and left them alone, Newt went inside his suitcase and took Jacob with him, where he prepared him an antidote for the Murtlap's bite and showed him rest of his creatures. Due too Newt's need to retrieve all the escaped creatures, they left the suitcase and decided to head to Central Park and find Newt's missing Erumpent.

Newt catching Niffler
However, after leaving the Goldsteins' apartment, Newt spotted his Niffler behind a window of the jewellery store. He used the Finestra spell to shatter the glass and get inside. Newt furiously attempted to capture the Niffler, falling through the other window in the process. Subsequently, they were confronted by a squad of policemen, who were puzzled by the sight of the Niffler. Jacob then directed their attention to a lion wandering right by them, giving him and Newt the opportunity to disapparate from the street.

Newt and Jacob catching Erumpent
While in Central Park they passed an ostrich. After Scamander's predictions of Erumpent current location, they headed to the Central Park Zoo. When Newt saw a hippopotamus backed up into a corner by the Erumpent, he provided Jacob with a helmet and vest to protect himself from the Erumpent and left him to hold a vial of Erumpent musk while he performed a mating dance to lure the creature back into his suitcase. Unfortunately, Jacob accidentally spilled musk on himself when he was hit by a fish thrown by an escaped seal, prompting the Erumpent to chase him out of the zoo and onto the frozen park pond before Newt managed to force it back into the suitcase.

Evading MACUSA
Newt is arrested and his case is confiscated
However, when they climbed back into the suitcase under a bridge in the park, Tina, who had followed them, locked them in and took them to the MACUSA headquarters. Before she interrupted a delegation of the International Confederation of Wizards to inform them about the creatures and the wizard who smuggled them into the country, Senator Henry Shaw Jnr has been killed. Newt was immediately blamed for allowing one of his creatures to murder a No-Maj. Newt, observing the scars and markings on Shaw's body projection, stated that only an Obscurus could have left the distinct markings upon his body, which caused unrest in the room, during which President Picquery denied the existence of any Obscurial in America. Newt, Tina and Jacob were soon taken under arrest by Percival Graves and Newt's case was impounded. In the jail cell, Newt and Tina explained to Jacob the meaning of an Obscurus and how no record existed at the time of an Obscurial having existed past the age of ten.

Newt being interrogated by Percival Graves
After discovering by Graves the harmless Obscurus that Newt brought to New York in the suitcase, during an interrogation, Newt was blamed by him for the actions of an particularly powerful Obscurus which killed Senator. Scamander was also accused by him for letting the animals For the Greater Good, in an attempt to begin a war. Newt's protests have done nothing and he was sentenced to death, as well as Tina. When they were brought to the Death cell and Tina was strapped into a chair with her memories extracted and casted into death potion under the chair, Newt freed himself with the help of his Bowtruckle, Pickett, which picked the lock on his handcuffs. Newt released then a Swooping Evil to attack executioners and rescue Tina. During their escape from MACUSA they were pursued by several Aurors defeated by Newt's Swooping Evil. They bumped into Jacob and Queenie, who managed to free the No-Maj from Obliviator and get Newt's suitcase from Graves' office. Newt and others climbed into it, and Queenie walked out of MACUSA headquarters with it.

Newt with Tina in the Blind Pig
Having two more beasts to catch, Newt had a problem with locating one, which most of the time was invisible. Tina came up with an idea to took everyone to the Blind Pig to meet Gnarlak, the Goblin who secretly traded magical creatures. Newton offered him some galleons, lunascope and freeze Ashwinder egg, but Pickett caught goblin's attention. Newt was reluctant to the exchange, but agreed, as a result he received the information that he was looking for, that he should look around Macy's department store. After Gnarlak's betrayal and MACUSA Aurors apparition Jacob punched the goblin. This allowed Newt to take Pickett and disapparate with Jacob and Goldstein sisters away from the pub.

Newt and Tina catching Occamy
Heading to the selected destination, Scamander and others found at Ginzberg Delaunay Newt's Demiguise, Dougal stealing things for an immensely sized Occamy. After some complications, like accidentally kicking a Christmas ornament by Queenie, Newt entrapped the Occamy with the help of Tina holding a teapot held and Jacob throwing a cockroach inside the dish.

Obscurial attack on New York City
Finally packing Demiguise and Occamy to the suitcase and bringing an end to the search for creatures, Newt and friends headed to the rooftop of the building, where they saw an Obscurus flying across Manhattan. Newt gave Tina his suitcase and Disapparated to save the Obscurial, but Tina handed the suitcase to Queenie and Jacob so she could join Newt.

Newt apparates to save Credence
When Newt saw Graves hunting Obscurus on the destroyed street, he deduced that the Obscurial was actually Credence Barebone. Even though Newt was not to blame Credence, Newt's hunt for magical beasts led him on a course to collide with Graves and Credence, and MACUSA was not far behind. Apparating from time to time on one of the rooftops and running in a line with flying Credence, Newt tried to protect him from the Aurors on the roofs trying to kill the Obscurial.

Newt after capturing Gellert Grindelwald
After going by Credence to a subway station, Scamander followed him. After being told the story of the Sudanese girl, Credence let Newt approach him. However, the sudden arrival of Graves failed the whole attempt of calming down Credence. Graves tried to kill Newton with lightning bolts, which provoked Credence to resume his Obscurus form. After Tina appeared in the subway and she tried to call him down again, the arrival of President Picquery and the MACUSA Aurors agitated him. They attacked him with many spells, only stopping when they believed he was killed. When shreds of Credence's Obscurus form fled the scene, Graves went on a rant in which Newt deduced who he really was. With the help of the Swooping Evil and Tina, Newt captured Graves and revealed that he was none other than famous Dark Wizard and international criminal, Gellert Grindelwald, using Human Transfiguration to assume the identity of MACUSA's employee.[30] While being apprehended by Aurors, Grindelwald met Newt's gaze and mysteriously asked him: "Will we die, just a little?".

After taking Grindelwald to MACUSA prison, Scamander helped prevent a wide-scale exposure of the wizarding world by employing the help of Frank from his case to create a rain laced with Swooping Evil venom, whose obliviating properties erased the bad memories of the Muggle citizens of New York, including his friend Jacob Kowalski.[31]

Returning to Europe
Newt temporarily says goodbye to his future wife, Tina
One week later, on 15 December, Scamander bumped into Kowalski while he was on his way to his job at the Moreton Dale Canning Factory and switched suitcases with him, leaving him a collection of silver Occamy eggshells and a letter instructing him to use the shells as collateral for a bank loan to start his bakery.[32]

The next day, on 16 December 1926, Tina thanked Newt for saying good things about her to Madam Picquery, which resulted in being restored as an Auror. Scamander, in turn, promised to deliver a copy of his book to Tina in person, said goodbye to her and boarded a ship.[33]

Choosing a side
Following his return to London, Newt was reprimanded by the Ministry for his role in the Obscurus incident and his right to travel internationally was revoked, meaning he couldn't deliver Tina the book as he had promised her. Newt had corresponded with her by letter, but he had soured the relationship by his missteps.

Newt with Leta, Theseus and Bunty during launch in Flourish and Blotts
Shortly after the events in New York, between January and March 1927, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was published and became a bestseller. It became an approved textbook at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and, by the mid-1990s, was in its fifty-second edition.[2] This made Newt famous throughout the wizarding world.[34] A launch party was held on 19 March at Flourish and Blotts on Diagon Alley, in which magizoologist was accompanied by his childhood friend Leta Lestrange, his older brother Theseus Scamander and his assistant, Bunty. He happily signed his fans' personal copies of his book.[35] After the party, Spellbound wrongly declared that Leta was Newt's fiancée, when in fact she and Theseus were getting married on 6 June 1928; Newt was supposed to be their best man.

Newt in the Ministry of Magic
On 30 May 1927, Gellert Grindelwald escaped while he was being transferred from America to face trial in Europe by Head of Incarceration, Rudolph Spielman and Aurors. Three months later, Newt head to the Ministry to appeal to have his travel ban revoked for the fifth time. While waiting for his turn he started play with Pickett, until he met Leta, who was there because Theseus had found her a job working as assistant to the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Torquil Travers. She went to Newt to take him to a meeting with commission, and they spoke about their friendship. Leta revealed that she and Theseus were always inviting Newt to dinner, but Newt always declined. When Theseus came along, he told his brother that he would be more open this time. During commission including, Theseus, Travers, Spielman and Arnold Guzman, US Emissary, they revealed to Newt that Credence Barebone survived and had been sighted in Europe. They offered to restore Newt's travel rights if he will join the Ministry as an Auror and will kill the Obscurial. Newt refused and walked out of the meeting, his task was assigned to Gunnar Grimmson. Approached by Theseus as he was leaving the meeting, his brother told him that eventually he would be forced to choose a side, something Newt refused to do. As Theseus embraced him to say goodbye, he whispered that the Ministry were watching him.[34]

Dumbledore asking Newt for help in London
After leaving the Ministry and fending off Stebbins, one of the Ministry's agents in Whitehall with the Windy Spell, Newt was accosted by a levitating gloved hand which points to a figure standing atop a high building nearby. Seizing the glove, Newt apparated besides the figure, who turned out to be his old Hogwarts teacher, Albus Dumbledore. Albus, after creating a fog around the city with his wand and using the deluminator on the lamps to avoid being tracked by the Ministry, apparated them near the bus stop. Albus mentioned the rumour that has been circling in pure-blood circles, that Credence may be the long-lost last member of the Lestrange family, a rumour, which Newt knew was connected to the half-brother of his childhood friend, Leta. Dumbledore, fearless that he can not face Grindelwald himself, asked Newt to go to Paris to find Credence, giving him the card with address of a safe-house where he can go if he needs to hide for a time. Newt was reluctant to go because of the Ministry's travel ban, the breaking of which would lead him to imprisonment in Azkaban, but still accepted the address, ever ready to do the right thing if the need arose.

Newt riding a Kelpie in the basement of his house
When Newt back to his town house, he found out that baby Nifflers run away from cage. He went downstairs to enlarged basement, where he set up his creatures, to help his assistant Bunty catch them and fed the large kelpie living in a large pool based on the appearance of a Scottish loch.[34] When they heard the noise Newt ordered Bunty to go home and he went upstairs.

Newt lifting the love charm from Jacob
To his surprise he got a visit from Queenie Goldstein and Jacob Kowalski, whose memory has not been completely erased, because the venom of the Swooping Evil removes only bad memories. Queenie informed Newt that Tina was heartbroken, because she read the wrong account in Spellbound of the upcoming marriage between Theseus and Leta, becoming convinced that Newt had patched up his relation with Leta and was ready to marry her, so she had started seeing a fellow Auror named Achilles Tolliver. When Queenie announced that she and Jacob were engaged and planned to be married, Newt noticed Jacob's odd behaviour and realised he had been enchanted by her, using a powerful love enchantment. After a brief argument Queenie agreed, and Newt lifted the spell. In cause Jacob, fearing that she would be punished for marrying a no-Maj, refused to marry her, so Queenie, feeling betrayed, disapparated to find Tina. Newt fixed the postcard Queenie lost and discovered that Tina was in Paris looking for Credence. It was only after learning where Tina was that Newt made the decision to go after Credence himself.

Visit to Paris
Newt and Jacob using a Portkey
After preparation for the journey, Newt, alongside with Jacob, headed to Dartmoor, where Newt gave fifty galleons to a Portkey tout, and then he illegally left England for France via a Portkey, hoping to patch up their respective relationships with the Goldstein sisters.

Newt searching for Tina
On one of the Paris streets Newt confunded a guard to allow himself and Jacob to sneak under a Magical Statue and move to the Place Cachée. Newt cast a Tracking Spell to locate Tina and then used a Summoning Charm on his magical suitcase to take out his Niffler, which looked for some traces. Using the Revelio Charm, Newt detected the presence of a Japanese Kappa and a Chinese Zouwu which had managed to escape from Circus Arcanus. He also detected Tina with a mysterious man, with whom she went to an unknown location. When the Niffler found a feather from the man's hat, Newt took the creature inside the suitcase, and charmed the feather allowing him and Jacob to track the man.

Newt and Jacob talking with Yusuf
Following the feather, the two ended up in a café. There, the French wizard introduced himself to both men as Yusuf Kama. Newt questioned him about Tina, so Yusuf took them to his hideout in one of the Parisian sewers, where he had in fact imprisoned Tina. Kama did the same with Newt and Jacob and said to Newt that he will not release them until he hunts down Credence Barebone. However, Kama then unexpectedly fainted, so Newt released Pickett to unlock the lock in the gate freeing himself, Tina, and Jacob. They then approached the unconscious Yusuf Kama and heard a powerful roar coming from above.

Newt catching the Zouwu
After pulling Kama out from the sewer they headed to the Alexander III Bridge, where Newt confronted the Zouwu. Conjuring up a toy, he caught the beast and returned him into his suitcase. Newt then seized Tina, Jacob and sick Yusuf and apparated them to Rue de Montmorency, where they went to Nicolas Flamel's house, the "safe house" address which Dumbledore had given Newt. At the alchemist's home, Newt used tweezers to pull out a water dragon parasite from Yusuf's eye which had been weakening him. Newt and Tina then both deduced that traces on Kama's hands showed that he made an Unbreakable Vow.

Infiltration of the French Ministry of Magic

When Grindelwald began rallying his supporters, Newt came to the conclusion that he should go with Tina to the French Ministry of Magic to find a box, which would tell them who really Credence was. To get there without being recognised, he drank polyjuice potion containing Theseus's hair, allowing him to temporarily take his brother's form. When the potion ceased to work and Newt was reverted to his true form, they were discovered by Theseus, who happened to actually be in Paris in a delegation, including Leta and Travers, due to the rumours of Newt's potential trip to Paris. He chased them, but Tina stunned him and tied him up to a chair - to Newt's joy, who said that might have been the best moment of his life.

Later, Newt and Tina introduced themselves to Melusine, the Ministry of Magic employee, as Theseus and Leta. Newt then revealed that his engagement was false and an error on the newspaper.  He then tried to profess how he feels to Tina but stuttered as he tried to describe the fire in her eyes. Tina realised what he was trying to say about her eyes and expressed that she really loved that description of her eyes. When they went to the Records Room to find the Lestrange family box, they were covered by Leta searching for the box too. They found out that the box was taken to the Lestrange Mausoleum, but Melusine knew Newt and Tina had lied about their identity and sent the Matagots, creatures responsible for defending the French ministry, after them and Leta. Newt told them that if they did not fight the Matagots they wouldn't hurt them, but Leta had already attempted to stun one, which caused it to multiply. When a hoard of angry Matagots began to chase them, Newt sent Leta and Tina into the suitcase and with the help of the Zouwu, that he had saved earlier he fled to the Pere Lachaise Cemetery.

When Tina and Leta came out and Newt packed Zouwu inside the suitcase, they all head to the Lestrange tomb and Leta found the Lestrange box which was taken, but they were not alone. They crossed paths with Jacob, Yusuf, Credence and Nagini. Leta stopped Yusuf, her half-brother, from killing Credence, who thought he was her other half-brother, Corvus Lestrange. Showing a box with her family tree she finally confessed to accidentally causing the death of Corvus, proving he and Credence were not the same person and that she had no idea who Credence actually was. Newt told her that it was not her fault that Corvus died, to which she responded that he had "never met a monster [he] couldn't love".

Grindelwald's Paris rally

When the door to next chamber opened, Newt and others joined Grindelwald's rally. He figured out that the departure of Queenie and moving the box were a bait to drag them to the mausoleum. During dark wizard's speech, a Niffler escaped from magizoologist suitcase. When the Aurors under Theseus' leadership infiltrated the rally and a witch was killed by one of the them, a very angry Grindelwald knelt to her dead body, not knowing that Newt's Niffler lurked near him. Grindelwald sent his followers away to spread the word and he began the fight, creating a circle of black flame to divide followers from enemies. Newt and Nagini unsuccessfully tried to pull Credence away from flames, same as Jacob want to do with Queenie, which was also at the rally. When they crossed unharmed and disapparated, Grindelwald then commanded his flames to kill Newt and Theseus, asking Newt did he think that Dumbledore will mourn after him, who both only managed to hold them back with the Shield Charm. Leta in response attacked Grindelwald and blasted his skull-hookah into pieces, sacrificing herself in an effort to give Newt, Theseus and the others time to get away. Before being killed by the dark wizard's flames she said to Newt and Theseus that she loved one of them, leaving Scamander brothers devastated. Newt seized Theseus and apparated with him outside the mausoleum, same as Tina did with Jacob and Yusuf with Nagini.

Newt and Theseus both using the General Counter-Spell to extinguish Grindelwald's fire.
 Furious Grindelwald unleashed the fire in order to kill them and destroy the whole city before Disapparating. Fortunately, Nicolas Flamel had arrived at the cemetery. He instructed Newt, Theseus, Tina and Yusuf to form a ring around the cemetery, planting their wands in the ground and using the general counter-spell. The effect was the creation of a counter-spell so great that it forced the fire back into the mausoleum where it ended its effects. After hugging a tearful Theseus and saying that he had chosen his side, Newt found his Niffler with stolen pendant protecting Grindelwald from Dumbledore's direct interference and realised that his teacher made a Blood Pact with the dark wizard.

Newt giving Dumbledore the pendant at Hogwarts
Despite managing to reconcile with Tina, Newt was powerless to stop Grindelwald from delivering a rousing speech, sharing a vision, threatening Paris with cursed fire and collecting Queenie, Credence and his followers to strike against Hogwarts (thus ridding himself of Albus Dumbledore) and the whole Wizarding and Muggle Worlds. During the battle that took place between Newt and Grindelwald, Scamander tragically lost his beloved Leta Lestrange, which finally compelled him to openly join the fight against the most dangerous dark wizard of his age.

After the events in the mausoleum, Newt, along with the group from Paris, picked up Travers and Spielman and travelled to Hogwarts to meet with Dumbledore at Hogwarts. Newt delivered him the pendant, so Dumbledore could destroy it, henceforth allowing himself to finally participate in the war and defeat Grindelwald.[34]

After Paris
A few years later, sometime in the 1930s, Albus Dumbledore enlisted Newt to start a army, with intrepid wizardkind to fight against Gellert Grindelwald and his Alliance.[36]

Later life (1945–2017)
Newt in his later years
Scamander married Tina Goldstein, and together they had at least one child[8] who produced at least one grandson named Rolf.[9]

In 1947, Scamander was responsible for the inception of the Werewolf Register, and, in 1965, created the Ban on Experimental Breeding, which he considered his proudest moment. Scamander also worked extensively with the Dragon Research and Restraint Bureau, which led him on expeditions all over the world, allowing him to collect information for new editions of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.[2]

In 1979, he was awarded the Order of Merlin, Second Class, for his services to Magizoology. He was also honoured with a Chocolate Frog Card named after him.

By the beginning of the 1990s, he was retired and living in Dorset with Tina and their three pet Kneazles, Hoppy, Milly, and Mauler,[2] but was known to study Fire Slugs in the Brazilian rainforest.[37] At some point during the 1993–1994 school year, he visited Hogwarts,[38] possibly to discuss the printing of a version of Fantastic Beasts for Muggle audiences.[2] Following his grandson's marriage to Luna Lovegood, Scamander became the great-grandfather of twin boys, Lorcan and Lysander.[10]

Scamander studies a hippogriff
At some point before 1992, Scamander authored A Children's Anthology of Monsters, for younger readers.[39]

In 2017, Scamander denied the rumours that he was sent to New York by his former teacher Professor Dumbledore to spy on the government there and find out any new information about Grindelwald's whereabouts. Scamander said he thought it was absurd he would pose as a magizoologist to achieve that, but admitted it was a bad idea to take a suitcase of creatures to New York.[40]

That year, Newt was also writing a foreword for a new edition of his book, in which he confirmed the public belief that he was indeed the first wizard ever to capture Gellert Grindelwald during his trip to New York in 1926. He played an active part in defeating Grindelwald over the next two decades. Newt was prevented from sharing any information between then and now, but the declassified documents were now beginning to be released, and he would be free to talk about them when they were.

However, Newt added he would in fact become involved in the hunt for Grindelwald later, and that he played an actual part in that hunt over the next two decades.[40]

Physical description
Newton Scamander was a tall wizard (6'1"), with brown hair and hazel eyes.[5] At age 29, even though he gave off the appearance of a slight, awkward man, he was actually rather muscular.[41] As a result of his Magizoological pursuits, he was left with several scars across his torso.[41]

His usual attire included a blue coat, brown vest, white shirt, bow tie, dark brown trousers with a wand holster, and brown boots. He also owned a Hufflepuff scarf that he occasionally wore.

During his travels in Paris, in 1927, he was shown with a grey woollen coat, and his usually unkempt looks became scruffier and more haggard, as his international travel ban and the attempts of the Minister for Magic to recruit him against Credence Barebone and Gellert Grindelwald were weighing on him heavily.

Personality and traits
Newton Scamander was a dedicated individual who tirelessly researched new information for his book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,[2] even when he was supposedly retired.[37] Considered an authority in the field of Magizoology, his works were respected throughout the wizarding community.[2] Newton was described as eccentric and felt more comfortable around creatures than he did around humans.[42] Eye contact and being close to another person usually made him very uncomfortable. He admitted that most people found him annoying.[43] Newton was particularly shy around women he had feelings for, as he deeply struggled to openly admit his feelings for his future wife, Tina Goldstein.[44] However, despite this, Newt understood that love must never be forced upon others and must instead be earned through effort, as shown by how he disapproved of Queenie's enchantment of Jacob and lifted it.

When communicating with other people, Newt was often an extremely awkward man, uncompromising and eccentric in the opinions of his peers. He preferred the company of his magical beasts, whom he expressed terror at the thought of them coming to harm. Unlike his confident older brother who was respected by his superiors, those in the Ministry (except for his brother and Leta Lestrange) didn't hold him in that high a regard. Newt was also uncomfortable with affection between himself and another human, struggling to come up with an explanation for Tina about his "engagement" to Leta, and disliking being hugged by his older brother.

That being said, Newt was a deeply compassionate man, speaking reasonably with Credence Barebone despite him being in a volatile and dangerous Obscurus form, and embracing Theseus after a battle with Grindelwald lost them Leta Lestrange, even though Newt was uncomfortable doing so in the past. It must be noted that despite clearly being bitter towards Theseus and Leta's engagement, Newt was still willing to not only act cordial, but even be the best man at the wedding, although he clearly showed his bitterness by refusing to interact with them both at once by declining any offers to see them. He even defended Leta when she showed her self-hatred for her part in Corvus V's death, when she lamented that Newt "had never met a monster he couldn't love". This shows that Newt's capacity for empathy outweighs his social difficulties. Furthermore, Newt developed a strong and consistent friendship with the No-Maj Jacob Kowalski, whom he admitted to really like and to really appreciate for his qualities and his helpfulness during their adventures, and to whom he even went out of his way to anonymously give Occamy eggs so that Jacob could open his own bakery. This cements Newt's lack of typical prejudice against Muggles that was common amongst most wizards when he first went to New York.

A man of principle, Newt was not the sort of man to discriminate against people based on their heritage or beliefs. He was also seen to be courteous with non-magical individuals like Mary Lou Barebone and Jacob Kowalski, the latter of which with whom he formed a close friendship. He expressed disgust at the idea of being one of Gellert Grindelwald's fanatics, going as far as to angrily told off the Dark Wizard, who was disguised as Percival Graves, and questioning him for even suggesting it, and did not remotely believe in wizard supremacy. He was also morally astute, expressing shock and discontent at morbidness and cruelty, such as the idea of using the Obscurus that killed a child for personal gain. Despite this Newt himself admitted that he showed poor judgement in his youth; he was also outspoken in his opinion of Aurors, despite Tina Goldstein herself being an Auror. Another example is when he brought his Thunderbird to the United States to set him free, let alone an entire suitcase full of magical creatures, given MACUSA's curse-to-kill policy at the time on such creatures.[40]

Another possible explanation of his behaviour is that it came from Albus Dumbledore himself, who was a staunch believer in the theory that Newt was actually acutely aware of the price of his actions, yet morally bound to always do the right thing, without any regard for safety, personal gain or even his own well being, with Dumbledore going as far as claiming that he admired Newt for not seeking power for himself. Dumbledore respected and admired Newt enough to speak out fervently against his expulsion from Hogwarts.[44] Indeed, Newt showed that he cared more for what was right than what would benefit himself, as he was not swayed by Gellert Grindelwald on either of their encounters, and strove to defeat the Dark wizard at all costs.

Magical abilities and skills
Magical mastery: Newt, despite his awkward behaviour and initial lack of recognition, proved himself to be an exceptionally skilled and powerful wizard, worthy of being deemed the favourite student of Albus Dumbledore, with a considerable amount of magical knowledge and variety of proficient skills that afforded him a highly verstaile skillset and allowed him to handle numerous dangerous situations effectively. In addition to being a famous Magizoologist who was capable of facing and handling some of the most dangerous beasts in the world and contributed deeply to the advancement of the magical field, Newt's magical abilities were secretly acknowledged by the Ministry of Magic and deemed surpassing enough that they repeatedly offered to make him an Auror out of a true belief that he would make an exceptional one, and even his war hero brother and the international wizarding committee that included even the abrasive Torquil Travers along with Rudolph Spielman and Arnold Guzman deemed him as being magically competent and strong enough to function as an efficient one, despite Newt's personality and repeated refusal, the committee going as far as to use his international travel rights as leverage to try to convince him to participate in the Global wizarding war and help hunt down Gellert Grindelwald, even being the first candidate to the mission of hunting down the extremely powerful Credence Barebone, and as an active participant, was able to offer remarkable contributions to the end of the global wizarding war, including even surviving at least two encounters with Gellert Grindelwald, once managing to hold him at bay just enough for Credence to save him and also being the only reason why he was captured when he was fighting an entire squad of aurors and easily winning in said encounter and later aiding his brother, future wife, and Leta in holding up against the Dark Wizard, at which point he also effectively aided Theseus, Tina, Yusuf and Nicolas Flamel in saving Paris.</p></html>
