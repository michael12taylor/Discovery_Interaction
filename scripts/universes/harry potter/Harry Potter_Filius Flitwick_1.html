Professor Filius Flitwick (b. 17 October[1] 1958 or earlier)[3] was a Part-Goblin wizard[19] who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was sorted into Ravenclaw House,[20] being an intelligent young man and a model student. Some time after his graduation, Flitwick returned to Hogwarts and became the Charms Master, as well as the Head of Ravenclaw House.[8]

During the First and Second Wizarding Wars, Flitwick opposed Lord Voldemort. In 1995, he also opposed Dolores Umbridge, the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, and, in 1997, fought at the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, after which he attended the Funeral of Albus Dumbledore. He also protected the students from the Carrows in the 1997-1998 school year. On 2 May 1998, he partook in the Battle of Hogwarts and defeated many Death Eaters.

He survived the war, and likely continued to teach Charms at Hogwarts to future generations of students.

Biography
Early life
Filius Flitwick was born somewhere in the British Isles into a wizarding family with the distant descent of a goblin, which accounted for his short stature. He was prejudged and foredoomed from an early age because of his ancestral connection to a different breed of being that was both regarded and treated as second-class citizens by much of the wizarding community.

Hogwarts years
By the time young Filius began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he was already used to being judged by strangers.

Brave in the face of adversity, however, whilst Flitwick once admitted to having been subjected to scrutiny from those around him from the minute he set his foot inside the castle,[21] the future professor carried his burden remarkably well: Wise beyond his years and rather thick-skinned, he eventually came to regard those who judged him as ignorant rather than malevolent, reasoning that most people simply want those around them to be simple so that they would be easier to understand, as opposed to simply acknowledge the fact that people are complex. In this, he indirectly proved himself to be correct: During his Sorting Ceremony, when the Sorting Hat wavered between putting him in Ravenclaw or Gryffindor before it ultimately chose the former. As the decision took less than five minutes, though, Flitwick was not a true Hatstall.[22]

At some point, he asked the Grey Lady about the whereabouts of Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem, which was rumoured to grant the wearer wisdom. However, she denied revealing the information. To his unknowing that she had already revealed it to a teenage Tom Riddle in the 1940s, It was also mentioned that Flitwick, being a model student with nothing to hide, never entered or used the Room of Hidden Things in the Room of Requirement.[18]

It is likely that he achieved a high graded O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. in Charms. He also may have taken exams in Defence Against the Dark Arts, as he became a Master Duellist sometime after leaving the school.

Duelling champion
After completing his Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests in his seventh year, Flitwick graduated from Hogwarts and then proceeded to become a Master Duellist and earned the title of "Duelling Champion" at some point,[9] and has a shelf full of trophies to prove it.[23] It is also likely Flitwick studied further into magic, becoming an accomplished wizard, masterful in spells, charms, and defensive magic, and even possibly earning the title of "Doctor", and becoming a fully-fledged and educated sorcerer before beginning his teaching career back at Hogwarts sometime in or before the early 1970s.[24]

Career at Hogwarts (pre 1971–1995)
Early years

Now back at his old school, Professor Flitwick took up the post of Charms Master. His classroom was Classroom 2E, which was located in the Charms corridor, on the third floor of the Training Grounds Tower.

Whilst to some degree still scrutinised for his short stature, he proved a gifted educator whom the students came to greatly respect, even if his teaching style was regarded as more "laid-back" than that of some other teachers at Hogwarts, such as Minerva McGonagall or Severus Snape. He, unlike them, allowed his students to play games during the lessons before the Christmas holidays, but he was not a bad teacher as Fred Weasley commented that he "couldn't see old Flitwick getting marked down and he usually gets everyone through their exams alright". He did not hand out many detentions or deduct points often, even for lateness.

He also got along rather well with his colleagues, and came to learn that the circumstance of his sorting occurred to Minerva McGonagall as well, which the two professors found amusing. This was because, had the Sorting Hat chosen Gryffindor for Filius and Ravenclaw for Minerva, they may have exchanged positions as Heads of House.

Known for his rich sense of humour, Filius was always fair with his students, even those who are not in Ravenclaw. Due to his heritage and the judgement he sometimes experienced because of it, Flitwick did not discriminate against those of different backgrounds and was inclined to allow people the benefit of the doubt. He also encouraged students to experiment with their own magic and did not generally give detentions for slack work; instead he preferred to give students homework so they could catch up. The only punishment he did give was lines, such as when Seamus Finnigan accidentally knocked him off of his stack of books by letting go of his wand in the air.[25]

First Wizarding War and aftermath
Flitwick teaching a Charms lesson
Flitwick lived through the First Wizarding War that raged during the 1970s, during which he was teaching at Hogwarts.[24]

In 1971, Flitwick taught charms to: Lily Evans, Sirius Black, James Potter, Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew, and Severus Snape. He also taught many others during this time as well.[24]

In 1976, Flitwick administered the Theory of Defence Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. He walked between the hundreds of small desks in the Great Hall during the exam and, once their time was up, ordered the students to put down their quills, but had to tell a pupil named Stebbins twice before they put their quill down. Flitwick then used the Summoning Charm to collect in the papers, but was knocked over onto the floor when the hundred scrolls of parchments zoomed into his outstretched arms. Thankfully, some students present helped him back up again.[24]

During the war, one of his most gifted and rebellious students, a young man by the name of Jacob began searching for five fabled rooms concealed in the school alleged by myths and rumours to be housing ancient treasure, and began breaking all sorts of school rules and endangering his fellow pupils to prove their existence, resulting in his expulsion. Prior to Jacob's departure from the school, Professor Flitwick, like the rest of the faculty, had to protect his charges from various powerful curses that were unleashed upon the school due to Jacob's meddling.[26]

At the end of the war, his former students Lily and James Potter were murdered, while protecting their infant son. Despite these dark times (or perhaps because of them) Flitwick continued to teach at the school.

Mystery of the Cursed Vaults
During the 1980s, Professor Flitwick taught Jacob's sibling, who was met with a lot of whispers of their brother's misdemeanours and sudden disappearance shortly after he was sent away from Hogwarts. Accustomed to be judged by strangers, Professor Flitwick was sympathetic with their situation, and admittedly worried about how their peers would treat them.[26]

When they expressed an interest in duelling, he agreed to teach them the Disarming Charm to teach them how to defend themselves, on the condition that they agreed to only use it defensively. He carefully warned them that duelling on school grounds was forbidden and grounds for expulsion.[23]

After Flitwick and Professor Snape subsequently caught Jacob's sibling duelling Merula Snyde, Flitwick initially refused to teach them the Knockback Jinx, and excused them from that class. However their response convinced him that they had learned from the experience, and he relented.[27]

The following school year, Jacob's sibling asked him, prior to a lesson, if the spell in question, the Shrinking Charm, was safe to use on sentient beings. Flitwick was suspicious and asked them if they were up to something. He sternly warned that such a thing would be extremely difficult and dangerous and should not be done.[28]

Protecting the Philosopher's Stone

Professor Flitwick, now in his elderly years, was still teaching at Hogwarts during the 1991–1992 school year. Just before the start of the new school year, Albus Dumbledore trusted him to contribute to the defences of the Philosopher's Stone Chambers. Flitwick, being the Charms Master, enchanted a considerable amount of Winged Keys to fly through the air.[29] At the start of his first lesson of the school year, he took the register and, upon seeing Harry Potter's name on his register, squeaked excitedly and fell off of his stack of books.[10] Also, Flitwick was very impressed when Minerva McGonagall, his long-time friend and fellow colleague, told him that she was giving a Nimbus 2000 to Harry after being chosen to play as the Seeker for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.[30]

Professor Flitwick did not allow his first year class to actually perform any magic until Hallowe'en, and, after some coaching, he gave each of his pupils a feather which they were to levitate using the Levitation Charm; Wingardium Leviosa. The class had been anxious to try this since Flitwick used the charm on Neville Longbottom's toad, Trevor. Hermione Granger, who was paired with Ronald Weasley, performed the spell perfectly and Professor Flitwick happily announced her success to the class.[31]

Flitwick at a Quidditch Match
Professor Flitwick also attended the first Quidditch match of the season; Gryffindor vs. Slytherin. He sat high up in the stands near Severus Snape and Quirinus Quirrell. He looked extremely shocked and worried when Harry seemingly lost control of his broom, as well as when Snape's cloak caught fire, but applauded merrily when Harry regained control and caught the Snitch.[32]

On Christmas Eve, Professors Flitwick and McGonagall were in charge of decorating the Great Hall. Flitwick used a spell to create golden bubbles to adorn the Christmas trees' branches. He also used live fairies to decorate, which he was rather fond of doing. The hall was noted to look absolutely spectacular. He also attended the Feast on Christmas Day and pulled a cracker with Professor Dumbledore. The Headmaster exchanged his pointed wizard hat for a flowery bonnet and Flitwick read a joke to him, which made him chuckle merrily.[33]

Flitwick attending the feast in the Great Hall
As the first year exams approached, Professor Flitwick set the first years homework to learn various spells and charms off by heart. When it finally was time for the tests, Flitwick called his students one-by-one into his classroom and asked them to make a pineapple tap-dance across his desk. He presumably also set theoretical papers, which were to be completed in a swelteringly hot classroom. Once the exams were over, Hermione Granger visited Flitwick in the staffroom, saying that she was worried that she got a question wrong in the theory test. He, unable to help himself, told her in confidentiality that she had gotten one hundred and twelve percent.[29] He also attended the End-of-Term Feast during which Gryffindor won the House cup breaking Slytherin's seven year winning streak.[34]

Re-opening of the Chamber of Secrets
Professor Flitwick continued to teach during the 1992–1993 school year. During a Charms class, Ron Weasley's wand flew out of his hand and hit Flitwick squarely in between his eyes, leaving a great green boil there, which he presumably vanished.[35] He also set a piece of homework for his second years to do, which involved using The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2. One of the first lessons that Professor Flitwick taught during the first term was revising the Levitation Charm. He also taught the second years the Skurge Charm, which cleans away Ectoplasm, and the Fire-Making Spell.[36]

"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir... beware"
Later on in the year, Mrs Norris, Argus Filch's cat, was found Petrified on the first floor. Professor Flitwick was amongst the crowd of students and teachers who saw her there, hanging from one of the torches.[35] Not long after, Colin Creevey, Justin Finch-Fletchley, and Gryffindor House Ghost Nearly Headless Nick, were also petrified. Professor Flitwick and the rest of the staff arrived at the scene shortly after the discovery and he, assisted by Professor Aurora Sinistra of the Astronomy department, took Justin to Madam Pomfrey in the hospital wing for treatment.[37]

The professors moments after Ginny Weasley was kidnapped by the monster
Near the end of the year, Professor Flitwick, along with the rest of the staff, were called to the staffroom by Professor McGonagall. McGonagall told them that Slytherin's Monster had kidnapped a student and taken them to the Chamber of Secrets. Flitwick immediately let out a squeal. McGonagall told them that the Heir of Slytherin had left another message right under the first, which read; Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever. Flitwick burst into tears at hearing the news. It had, in fact, been Ginny Weasley, one of Flitwick's students, and, when Lockhart entered the room, the whole staff turned against him. While all the teachers told him his comments of knowing what was in the Chamber and so forth, Flitwick piped in and said that he had told that he was quite sure he knew what was inside it.[38]

The next day, Professor Flitwick was to send his Ravenclaws home on the Hogwarts Express. However, Harry Potter had slain the monster, sealed the Chamber and saved Ginny, so Hogwarts remained open. Instead, Flitwick attended the End-of-Term Feast and applauded happily when Rubeus Hagrid returned from Azkaban, being wrongfully sent there on suspicion of the Chamber openings.[39]

Had the Chamber of Secrets not been opened during the year, Professor Flitwick would have had to administer the Second Year Exams. However, at the End-of-Term Feast, Professor Dumbledore cancelled all examinations as a special school treat.[39]

Sirius Black's escape

Prior to the beginning of the 1993–1994 school year, Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban and Dementors were placed outside Hogwarts for the students' safety (particularly Harry Potter's). Regardless, Professor Flitwick continued his tenure as Charms Master and the Conductor of the Hogwarts choir. During the Welcoming Feast, Flitwick led a reciting of Something Wicked This Way Comes.[14] He was later seen carrying the Sorting Hat and its three-legged stool out of the great hall after the Sorting ceremony had taken place. During the Start-of-Term Feast, he sat next to the new Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor Remus Lupin, where the two talked amicably together.[40]

Flitwick meeting with McGonagall, Hagrid, Madam Rosmerta, and Cornelius Fudge in Hogsmeade
Near Christmas, Professor Flitwick went to the Three Broomsticks Inn with McGonagall, Hagrid, Madam Rosmerta and Cornelius Fudge. Together, they discussed James and Lily Potter's murders, as well as the escape of Sirius Black. It was said that the Potters used the Fidelius Charm, that was most likely cased by Dumbledore himself, to protect their home in Godric's Hollow. Flitwick then explained and described the operation of the charm and the position of Secret-Keeper.[41]

During the snowy season, Professor Flitwick taught his third years the Seize and pull charm. While explaining the spell's uses to the class, Hermione Granger arrived late from a Study of Ancient Runes class with Professor Babbling, having used a Time-Turner to go back in time.[42] This happened again after the Easter holidays when Hermione overslept and missed the Charms class on Cheering Charms.[43]

Soon after, Professor McGonagall confiscated a Firebolt broomstick that Harry Potter received as an anonymous Christmas present, and she handed it over to Professor Flitwick and Madam Rolanda Hooch, the Flying Instructor. The two examined it to see if there were any malicious or unfriendly spells cast upon it, since they thought it possible that Sirius Black had sent it to him in the hope of killing him.[44]

Later on in the year, Sirius Black successfully broke into the castle and infiltrated the boys' dormitory in Gryffindor Tower. As a defence mechanism, Professor Flitwick taught the oak front-doors to recognise a picture of Black so as to not grant him access.[45] Also around this time, Flitwick set the Third Year Exams, which involved casting the Cheering Charm.[46]

Nearer the end of the school year, Black was finally captured and locked inside Professor Flitwick's office on the seventh floor near the base of the West Tower. However, Black vanished that night and escaped from the castle.[47]

Triwizard Tournament

Professor Flitwick continued his career in 1994 at Hogwarts when the Triwizard Tournament was being held. During the 1994 Start-of-Term Feast, he sat next to Professor Sprout on a large pile of cushions at the High Table.[48]

He taught the Summoning Charm to his fourth year students shortly before Hallowe'en and assigned three books worth of reading before actually starting.[49] It was this charm that Harry Potter used during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament, which earned him first place.[50]

Professor Flitwick later taught his fourth year class the Banishing Charm. He started to ease off his lessons in the week before Christmas and the Yule Ball and instead spent his time talking about the Summoning Charm that Harry had used in the First Task, being a proud Charms Master.[51]

The Yule Ball which Flitwick attended
During the Yule Ball, Professor Flitwick conducted the Hogwarts school choir in playing waltzes. The choir played several waltzes over the course of the evening, giving students a chance to slow dance with their partners. However, once the dances "heated up" and the Weird Sisters arrived to perform, Flitwick was passed over the heads of all the dancers, imitating what Muggles call a mosh-pit, yelling at them to let him down.[15]

In the Third Task, Professor Flitwick, along with Minerva McGonagall, Rubeus Hagrid, and Bartemius Crouch Jnr disguised as Alastor Moody, was appointed one of the marshals to patrol around the Maze. He wore a shining star on his wizard hat and had to respond to any of the champions cries for help (via the Red Sparks spell).[52] At the end of the task, Cedric Diggory was murdered, and Lord Voldemort was declared to have risen to power again,[53] and thus the Second Wizarding War began.[54] Flitwick attended the Memorial Feast to Cedric Diggory at the end of the year.[15]

Second Wizarding War (1995–1998)
Ministry interference at Hogwarts
The next year, Dolores Umbridge became the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.[55] She quickly arose to become the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, gaining the power to inspect the teaching standards of her fellow colleagues.[56]

During Umbridge's inspection of Professor Flitwick's Charms Class, she sat in the corner of the classroom making notes on her clipboard while he taught his N.E.W.T. students. He treated her like a guest and did not seem to be distracted by her at all, since she hardly spoke, though she did ask Alicia Spinnet what the classes were like. Satisfied with what she had heard and seen, Umbridge left Flitwick to continue his lesson.[56]

Umbridge inspecting Flitwick
When Umbridge inspected Professor Flitwick's class with the school choir, she seemed impressed and pleased, but pulled out a tape measure and measured Flitwick's height. He seemed really discontented and looked rather offended, finding this gesture insulting, especially since he was part-goblin, which he inherited from his ancestor.[16]

Once Professor Umbridge had banned The Quibbler from the school after an interview of Harry Potter was printed, all the teachers were proud of him standing up to her. Professor Flitwick, not allowed to talk about anything not relating to his subject, secretly gave a box of Sugar Mice to Harry during one of his classes, before saying "shh!" and hurrying away.[57]

Later on in the year, Professor Umbridge became the new Headmistress after Professor Dumbledore left the school. On her first day in office, Fred and George Weasley released fireworks into Hogwarts Castle and some sparklers managed to find themselves in Classroom 2E, Flitwick's classroom. He, wanting to annoy Umbridge like the rest of the staff, ran for her help. Once she had extinguished the fireworks, he revealed that he could have gotten rid of them himself, but he wasn't sure that he had the "authority", before slamming the door in her face.[24]

Flitwick during the flight of Fred and George Weasley
After Easter break, Fred and George used one of their inventions, a Portable Swamp, to change a corridor into a bog and then departed from school to go into the world of business.[58] Professor Flitwick was seen cheering and supporting them at their departure after they ran rings around Umbridge and Argus Filch.[16] Flitwick was asked to remove the swamp they created at the end of the year, which he did, but he claimed to be unable to remove a small patch under a window. He actually left it there as a tribute to what he saw as a demonstration of rather advanced magical capabilities.[59]

Protecting Hogwarts from Death Eaters
Professor Flitwick at the school gates with Harry Potter and Luna Lovegood
In 1996, Hogwarts was put under the protection of a group of Aurors. Professor Flitwick, together with the caretaker, Argus Filch, was appointed to check off every student entering the school at the entrance gates on a register and take their belongings to be searched for any dark artefacts or weapons.[60][17]

One of the N.E.W.T.-level charms he taught to his sixth year students that year was how to cast the Water-Making Spell.[61] During a lesson regarding the practising of this spell, Seamus Finnigan whilst daydreaming, accidentally flicked his wand a little too hard and conjured such a powerful jet of water from his wand that he knocked Flitwick flat on his face, after it richoted from the ceiling. He set Seamus lines as punishment, asking him to write "“I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick”.[25]

He later taught them how to turn vinegar into wine. He approached Harry, Ron, and Hermione during the lesson and asked them to perform the spell. Hermione cast it perfectly the first time, while Harry turned his to ice and Ron blew his up. Flitwick gave the two boys homework based on their performance, to practise for next lesson.[62]

Flitwick meets Horace on his way back to the castle, during a trip to Hogsmeade
During one of the students' trips to Hogsmeade, Professor Flitwick also visited the village, possibly for security reasons. On his way back to the castle Horace Slughorn (the current Potions Master) invited him to have a drink at the Three Broomsticks Inn, but Flitwick claimed to have "emergency choir practice" and left him.[17] It is not clear if this is true or not. He very well could have been leaving Hogsmeade because he knew Slughorn would want to reminisce at the Three Broomsticks.

Battle of the Astronomy Tower
Later on in the year, Flitwick was in the Great Hall with the Hogwarts choir[17] when Death Eaters invaded Hogwarts and Minerva McGonagall ordered him to get Severus Snape. When inside Snape's office, Snape Stupefied him, and told Hermione Granger and Luna Lovegood that he had collapsed and that they should tend to him till he regained consciousness.[13]

Flitwick, McGonagall, Hagrid, and students at the base of the tower after Dumbledore's death
Shortly after knocking Flitwick out, Snape killed Professor Dumbledore. Once recovering from his attack by Snape, Flitwick insisted on looking after the Ravenclaws. He also took part in the conversation of whether or not Hogwarts should remain open or be closed, as having the Headmaster killed by one of the staff was a "terrible stain on Hogwarts history." Flitwick insisted that the decision should be made by the school governors, which Minerva McGonagall, the new Headmistress, was inclined to agree with. He also argued that Dumbledore should be buried in the grounds, which had never happened to any Headmaster or Mistress.[63] Professor Flitwick, with the rest of the staff and students, later attended the funeral of Albus Dumbledore at the end of the year in the grounds near the Hogwarts Lake.[64]

Voldemort's infiltration of Hogwarts
Prior to the start of the 1997–1998 school year, Severus Snape was made Headmaster of Hogwarts while his fellow Death Eaters, Alecto and Amycus Carrow, became the Muggle Studies and Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers respectively. Despite the school now in the grasp of Lord Voldemort, or perhaps because of it, Professor Flitwick returned to the castle to teach and protect the students.[65]

The Carrows were put in charge of all discipline and punishments, although Flitwick and the staff never sent students to them if they could avoid it, as the new professors' idea of punishment included such horrors as the Cruciatus Curse.[63]

Battle of Hogwarts
Filius Flitwick casting Protego Maxima to protect Hogwarts
Near the end of the 1997–1998 school year, Alecto ordered Professor Flitwick to let her into Ravenclaw Tower. He did so, answering the riddle required to enter. When she failed to come out, Amycus told McGonagall to make Flitwick open the door for him too, but she did it herself.[66]

That night, Flitwick, with Professors Sprout and Slughorn, was awoken by Minerva McGonagall's cat patronous, and, still in their night-clothes, went to find out what she wanted. They found McGonagall duelling Snape to the death, and, after squeaking her name in shock, told Snape he would not commit any more murder in the castle. He proceeded to cast a spell which animated the suit of armour that Snape was using to shield himself from McGonagall. Snape then ran into a classroom, chased by Flitwick, Sprout and McGonagall, and flew out of the window, escaping them.[66]

Aware that Lord Voldemort would soon attack the castle, Flitwick and the other Professors set to defend the school and the students. He pointed his wand out of the window and cast several intricate protective spells, including Protego horribilis. Then, he was quizzed over the Lost Diadem of Rowena Ravenclaw by Harry Potter, whom he was shocked to see, under the circumstances. He told Harry that the diadem was long since lost and that it wouldn't really help anyway, unaware that it was a Horcrux.[66]

After a brief discussion of how to fight the Death Eaters, it was agreed that Flitwick, McGonagall and Sprout would take groups of over-age fighters up to Ravenclaw Tower, Gryffindor Tower and the Astronomy Tower. Flitwick presumably took his group up to Ravenclaw Tower, since it was a good place to work spells and enchantments.[18]

Professor Flitwick was seen fighting Yaxley close to the front doors in the Entrance Hall,[67] just before Voldemort ordered everyone to cease duelling and offered peace in return for Harry Potter.[68] However, battle soon resumed after Harry was thought to be murdered by Voldemort. In the Great Hall, Antonin Dolohov was seen falling to the ground with a scream at Flitwick's hands, defeated and possibly killed.[69]

Sprout, Flitwick, and Slughorn after the battle in the Great Hall
Flitwick also witnessed the duel between Harry and Voldemort in the Great Hall and after Voldemort's spell rebounded on him, Flitwick, Sprout, and McGonagall all reached to hug Harry at the same time while everyone else joined in.[69]

A celebration feast was later held, but no one sat in their proper places; teachers, parents and students were all jumbled up. It is likely that Professor Flitwick sat by the Ravenclaws, since he was their Head of House. He was seen talking with Horace Slughorn and Pomona Sprout after the battle.[70]

Later life (1998–2020)
Following the Battle of Hogwarts, Professor Flitwick continued his long tenure as Charms Master, and diligently proceeded to educate the next generations of young witches and wizards on the subject he had devoted his life to teach. On 14 December during the 2018–2019 school year, however, slightly more than half a year following the twenty-year anniversary of their victory over the Dark Forces at the legendary battle, a Muggle speed camera captures blurry footages of several out-of-control riderless Nimbus 2000 broomsticks, speeding on a motorway in Sydney, Australia. This incident would soon thereafter be followed by a series of outbreaks of chaotic magic, culminating in arguably the greatest ever breach of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy in the magical history. Never one to stand idly by when disaster strikes, however, he would soon join Headmistress Minerva McGonagall in doing whatever he could to help the then recently established Statute of Secrecy Task Force. In addition to donating his personal, annotated copy of the The Book of Charms & Spells to those of its members who pursued Professorship to help them improve their casting of charms to address the events of the Calamity,[71] along with showing them the secrets of his exceptionally powerful Protection Charm to allow them to enhance an ally's defence, imparting to them the importance of specificity in your spell casting and footwork to increase defensive power and co-teaching along with Professor Sprout how different magical approaches – when combined with teamwork – achieve devastating effects, he also ministered weekend seminars on Martial magic for members of the Auror Office that wanted to join the aforementioned task force,[72].

Physical description
Flitwick, due to his goblin blood, was particularly short and frequently described as "tiny little Professor Flitwick". He had a shock of white hair in his elderly years and brown when he was younger. Also when he was young, he usually wore black clothes and suits as opposed to the green robes that he wore in his later years.

Personality and traits

Flitwick was an emotional fellow, who seemed to have a gentle spirit. During the 1992–1993 school year when Ginevra Weasley was taken into the Chamber of Secrets, he burst into tears, and in 1993's Valentine's Day, when Gilderoy Lockhart called him a "sly old dog", he buried his face in his hands. He was also shown to have a sense of mischief and fun. He sarcastically remarked to Dolores Umbridge that, while he easily had the ability to remove Fred and George's rampaging fireworks, he wasn't sure if he had the authority. He also discretely cheered the Weasley Twins' escape from the school, and left a small patch of the twin's Portable Swamp under the window, which Ron believed he had done as a monument to Fred and George. He also covertly sneaked Harry a box of Sugar Mice so as to reward him for speaking out about Voldemort in the Quibbler because he couldn't talk about it aloud, murmuring a little 'shush' to Harry afterwards.

Flitwick was considerably more tolerant of disobedience than most of his fellow professors, known for rarely handing out detentions and deducting House Points, his more laid-back and forgiving teaching attitude making him particularly liked and respected by the students. This has been shown many times during his Charms lessons: when Ron, due to his broken wand, accidentally cast a spell that hit Flitwick square in the face, Flitwick was not known to punish him as Ron got away with only cursing his broken wand. Neither did he punish Hermione for not showing up in class to learn the Cheering Charm, only warning her that it would appear in the exam. Additionally, when Neville Longbottom, while fumbling with attempts at casting a Banishing Charm, ended up sending Flitwick sailing across the room; Flitwick accepted this resignedly and let Neville off. Rather than punishing Seamus with detention after he accidentally hit Flitwick with the Water-Making Spell, Flitwick instead had him do lines. He was also shown to be much more generous than the other teachers even in normal occasions, as he allowed his students to play games in class when Christmas was near and did the same during the approach to the Yule Ball in 1994 when he saw their minds were elsewhere. Rather than punish those who slacked in their studies, Flitwick preferred to give homework for students to catch up and he also encouraged them to experiment with magic.

A wise man even at his youth, despite having been discriminated in his early life due to his small stature and goblin ancestry, Flitwick saw those who discriminated him not as hateful but instead ignorant. He was eminently fair and never discriminated anyone regardless of their origin or whether they were of different house and treated all students the same. This is shown by how despite the wrongdoings one of his students, Flitwick was quick to favour and develop a close relationship with his sibling, teaching them several advanced spells and forgiving their misdeeds.

Nevertheless, he commanded respect in spite of his sensitive nature and small stature. When he encountered Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy on the stairs discussing Harry's new Nimbus 2000, Malfoy treated him just like any other teacher with no hint of the sarcasm he used with Remus Lupin.

Magical abilities and skills
As a former Duelling Champion and as the Hogwarts Professor of Charms, Flitwick was a powerful and formidable wizard. Testaments to his considerable magical skills were his proficiency in the subject he taught, and his later participation in and surviving the Battle of Hogwarts.

Intellectual giftedness: As the Head of Ravenclaw House, Flitwick was a highly shrewd and knowledgeable man. During the preparations for the Battle of Hogwarts, he was the one who realistically pointed out that even the combined efforts of the entire Hogwarts staff was insufficient to keep Voldemort out indefinitely.[66]
Charms: Arguably the best and most knowledgeable Charms teachers in the world,[73] he was capable of effectively casting numerous charms and enchantments, ranging from everyday charms[31] to the most advanced Shield Charms.[66] He was also able to conjure a non-corporeal Patronus,[11][12] which is an incredibly advanced and powerful piece of protective magic as well as concrete evidence of superior magical ability, given the immense difficulty of performing the said charm.
Duelling: An immensely accomplished duellist, Flitwick was rich in both learning and experience where the study and practice of duelling techniques and strategies were concerned. He participated professionally in a number of competitions and championships after his graduation from Hogwarts. Ultimately, he carved out an impressive reputation for himself as a Duelling Champion, earning himself a whole shelf full of trophies to boot.[23] Though he had not duelled in some time, it was later shown that he had retained his considerable skill. Flitwick was able to help fellow Professors McGonagall and Sprout chase Severus Snape out of the castle and emerged and survived the legendary Battle of Hogwarts. During the battle, he had duelled the powerful Yaxley to a draw and even single-handedly defeated the extremely skilled Antonin Dolohov, who had previously defeated Alastor Moody and murdered Remus Lupin, showing his remarkable proficiency in martial magic. Later still, he supplemented the training that Aurors had received before joining the department, showing that he maintained his skill, knowledge and dexterity in professional wizard's duelling even well into his elderly years.[72]
Defence Against the Dark Arts: Flitwick had outstanding defensive abilities against even the greatest Dark magic, having led the extremely powerful defences put around the castle that was only broken by Voldemort himself, a feat which caused the Dark Lord some backlash.[66][70] Flitwick was also capable of examining Harry Potter's Firebolt for dark charms with the help of Rolanda Hooch in a stripping-down process, showing he was knowledgeable in the field of defensive magic.[44]
Transfiguration: Flitwick was shown to be highly proficient in the transfiguration branches of Conjuration and Vanishment, creating baubles from his wand to decorate the Christmas trees and being able to swiftly vanish a Portable Swamp.
Wandless and non-verbal magic: Flitwick was also highly skilful in non-verbal magic. In 1996, once every student was inside Hogwarts grounds, he cast a protective barrier on the school gate without saying the incantation. As non-verbal magic is very difficult, this testifies to him being a truly powerful wizard. Furthermore, Flitwick was shown to be able to conjure blue flames without using his wand.[36] This is yet another testament to his formidable magical talents, given that wandless magic was seen to be a feat that only wizards of the highest level (such as Dumbledore and Voldemort) were able to successfully accomplish.
Conducting: Flitwick became the Conductor of the Hogwarts Choir during the 1993–1994 school year, and taught the choir how to sing Something Wicked This Way Comes and In Noctem. He also led the orchestra during the Yule Ball.
Possessions
Flitwick's wand
Wand: Professor Flitwick owned a wand, which was of an unknown length, wand wood and wand core. He presumably obtained it from Ollivanders in Diagon Alley prior to starting his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Office: While teaching at Hogwarts, Flitwick owned an office on the castle's seventh floor, which is where he stayed and slept during the school terms.
Tin: This tin was kept inside a desk in his office.
Duelling trophies: Flitwick owned various prestigious trophies, earned from his days as a Duelling champion.[23]
Spellbooks: Flitwick owned numerous different spellbooks on various different charms, such as the Spongify spellbook, Incendio spellbook and Carpe Retractum spellbook, which he used heavily whilst teaching.
The Book of Charms & Spells: In the 21st century, Flitwick gave his personal annotated copy of the book to members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force who pursued a Professorship profession to help them improve their casting of charms to address the events of the Calamity.[71]
Relationships
Harry Potter
Harry Potter, his student
Professor Flitwick was kind to Harry Potter and had a good relationship with him. He was so excited to see Harry's name for the first time on his register that he fell off of his stack of books with a squeak. He allowed Harry and his friends to talk during classes, as well as play games sometimes. 

In 1994 he spent the majority of a lesson discussing the "perfect" Summoning Charm Harry used in order to obtain his Firebolt for the first task. In 1998 he helped defend Hogwarts Castle to give time for Harry to find Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem, casting Protego horribilis on the school grounds. He was among the first ones to run and hug him after he defeated Lord Voldemort.

Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley

Flitwick also had a good relationship with Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. Hermione was a very good student and thus Flitwick liked her. Flitwick was thoroughly impressed when Hermione managed to successfully cast the Levitation Charm, announcing her feat to the class. He was also friendly with Ron Weasley, who was a friend of Hermione and Harry. Ron liked Flitwick's method of teaching, as he usually let them talk during his lessons. Flitwick fought alongside Ron and Hermione at the Battle of Hogwarts and they all survived the battle.

Ravenclaw students

Professor Flitwick was very caring and protective of the members of his House, Ravenclaw, as he was Head of Ravenclaw House.[8] In 1997, when Death Eaters invaded Hogwarts Castle by use of a Vanishing Cabinet, Flitwick was knocked out, but left the Hospital Wing in a hurry in order to look after the Ravenclaws, despite still being shaky from his attack. At the end of the year, after Albus Dumbledore's death, Flitwick, as well as Minerva McGonagall, Pomona Sprout, Rubeus Hagrid, and Horace Slughorn had to decide whether the school should re-open the following year. He could not decide where his students would be safer, at Hogwarts or at their homes, and wanted to leave the decision to the board of governors, which Professor McGonagall was inclined to agree to.

The school did indeed reopen for the 1997–1998 school year, but McGonagall had been replaced as Head by Severus Snape. Alecto and Amycus Carrow, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts and Muggle Studies professors, treated all of the school's students brutally and horribly, aside from the Slytherins of course. Because of this, Flitwick protected the Ravenclaws, as well as the other students, from the Carrows, as did McGonagall, Sprout and Slughorn. Once Lord Voldemort declared war on the Castle, Flitwick fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and survived, so he likely continued to teach and care for the next generation of Ravenclaws.

Hogwarts professors
Some of his colleagues
Flitwick seemed to have a good relationship with most of his colleagues at Hogwarts. Some of them were Minerva McGonagall and Pomona Sprout. All three were professors at Hogwarts, while Heads of House. Prior to the Battle of Hogwarts, McGonagall and Flitwick, watched by Sprout and Horace Slughorn, duelled Professor Snape, who had taken hold of the school, ultimately forcing him to flee. Both Sprout and Flitwick exhibited yells of shock at Harry Potter when he unexpectedly arrived at the school, and Sprout and McGonagall fought alongside Flitwick in the Battle of Hogwarts and survived the Second Wizarding War. After the duel between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort, the three of them hurried to Harry to congratulate him and celebrate.

After Severus Snape murdered Dumbledore, he and his fellow professors turned on him. He protected Minerva McGonagall from Snape when both of them were duelling, and warned him that he wouldn't commit another murder in Hogwarts. It is likely that he learnt Snape's true loyalty after the Second Wizarding War, and the true reason he murdered Dumbledore, not to mention that he was protecting the students all along, albeit discreetly. Following this, it is assumed that he forgave Snape and even admired his courage. 

Flitwick may have also been friendly with, or at least unusually persuasive to, Poppy Pomfrey, the school matron, as the strict nurse very rarely let people out of the Hospital Wing until they made a full recovery, but she let Flitwick out after he was hit by a stunner by Severus Snape, despite still being shaky. This may, however, just be because he was the Charms Master and a professor.

Horace Slughorn, the Potions Master and Head of Slytherin House, seemed to believe that he was friendly with Professor Flitwick. However, the latter seemed to try to avoid him during a trip to Hogsmeade after he invited him to the Three Broomsticks Inn. Flitwick declined, saying that he had "emergency choir practice" with the Hogwarts choir back at the school.

Professor Flitwick, like all the other professors at the school, disliked the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher of the 1992–1993 school year; Gilderoy Lockhart. Despite Lockhart being a former Ravenclaw, and one of his old students, Flitwick did not have a very good relationship with him, as Gilderoy was always an attention-seeking, vanity-rich troublemaker who never took his studies seriously. On Valentine's Day, Lockhart suggested to the students that they ask Professor Snape to brew them Love Potions and said that Flitwick knew more about Entrancing Enchantments than anyone he knew. Flitwick responded by burying his face in his hands, while Snape looked like he would force-feed poison to the first person to ask him for a love potion. When Lockhart walked into the staff meeting regarding Ginny Weasley's alleged demise in a rather oblivious and cheerful manner, Flitwick was among the staff to look at him with remarkable hatred, and also did not hesitate to send him to the Chamber of Secrets as a means to scare him away.
