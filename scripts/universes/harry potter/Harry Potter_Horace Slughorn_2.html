<html><p>However, even though Slughorn had managed to modify his memory to hide what he told Tom, Harry Potter managed to take the original version of the memory with the help of Felix Felicis, in 1997, and from it, he and Dumbledore gleaned crucial information about what Voldemort had done and what it would take to destroy him. 

When Voldemort managed to take over Hogwarts in 1997, Slughorn finally found out what Tom wanted from him. He was surprised to find that it was only to teach at Hogwarts, showing that perhaps Tom respected Slughorn, his status and his teaching enough to keep him around. Regardless, Slughorn fought Lord Voldemort head on, with the help of Minerva McGonagall and Kingsley Shacklebolt, during the Battle of Hogwarts, in 1998. His duel with him likely allowed him to come full circle for his contribution to his former student's rise to power and all of the deaths that transpired in his wake. In this regard, Slughorn redeemed himself in his own eyes, fighting for everyone who had ever been harmed by Voldemort.

Albus Dumbledore
Albus Dumbledore, his good friend and colleague
Albus Dumbledore and Horace Slughorn were colleagues at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1931 until 1981, when Slughorn retired and Severus Snape took his place as Potions Master. As Slughorn was equally disinclined to join the Order of the Phoenix as the Death Eaters, Dumbledore most likely accepted Slughorn for the fairly self-serving, but overall harmless and genuinely talented Wizard he was. Dumbledore asked Slughorn to resume his old position in 1996, and Slughorn accepted after being enticed with the prospect of being able to teach Harry Potter.

Dumbledore wanted to tread carefully with Slughorn and not force him to divulge the memory because it would ruin their friendship. Dumbledore feared that if Slughorn felt betrayed, he may even leave the school and join the Dark Lord.

Dumbledore suspected that Slughorn may have inadvertently given Tom Riddle some dangerous information; in order to determine exactly what Riddle had been planning to use it for, Dumbledore attempted to retrieve the memory of the specific discussion from Slughorn. Ashamed of what he'd allowed himself to be charmed into doing, Slughorn modified his own memory and gave Dumbledore that version. Given Slughorn's fondness for famous and/or talented students, Dumbledore tasked Harry Potter, arguably the most famous student Slughorn would ever teach, to retrieve the original memory. As Dumbledore had predicted, Harry had been in the perfect position to convince Slughorn to allow the truth to be uncovered, and together, Harry and Dumbledore set about the task of destroying Voldemort's Horcruxes.

Horace was highly shocked by Dumbledore's death and attended his funeral. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Horace fought the Dark Lord head on in honour of his friend's death and to protect his former students and school.

Slug Club

Slughorn prefers to associate with well-connected students or those with promising future careers. The coterie of students that he has collected around himself is nicknamed the 'Slug Club', from the first part of his surname. Horace believed all of his favourites had the potential to become highly successful, and hoped to benefit in the future from fostering connections with them early on. Some of his former students who had already met or exceeded his expectations by the time he resumed teaching at Hogwarts in 1996, were Ambrosius Flume, Dirk Cresswell, Barnabas Cuffe, Eldred Worple, Gwenog Jones, and Wendy Slinkhard.

However, there were other of his former pupils who achieved some degree of fame (or more accurately, notoriety) with whom he didn't maintain contact, nor did he approach their children in 1996, as he had no desire to be associated with Death Eaters — these former pupils included Lucius Malfoy, Avery, the Lestranges, Nott, and Goyle.

Some members of the Slug Club during Horace's second tenure as Potions master at Hogwarts were Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, Blaise Zabini, Cormac McLaggen, Flora, and Hestia Carrow. All of them possibly had connections with someone famous, except for Hermione and Ginny, who were chosen because of their magical abilities. Slughorn especially appeared to like Hermione, who was arguably the all-around top student of her year.

There were other students who were invited for an interview, but didn't make the cut, such as Neville Longbottom, who appeared to lack the talent his parents had displayed as great Aurors, and Marcus Belby, whose family was not particularly close to his famous potioneer uncle.

Ron Weasley was not invited to join the club, much to Ron's frustration, considering both of his best friends were members. Horace didn't seem to think much of him at first, and often forgot his name, calling him "Ralph" or "Rupert". However, Horace appeared to grow to like him as a person, as he wished Ron a "happy birthday" and visited him at the Hospital Wing after Ron was poisoned.

It is unknown whether any of the Slug Club members (apart from the ones who were still Hogwarts students) fought alongside the reinforcements which Slughorn rallied during the Battle of Hogwarts against Voldemort's forces.

Arthur Weasley
Arthur Weasley, his former student who he did not think too highly of
Horace Slughorn didn't seem to think much of Arthur Weasley, believing he wasn't a "highflier" or powerfully, gifted wizard while teaching him at Hogwarts, despite Arthur being pure-blooded, choosing to favour students who were magically talented and had strong connected with other powerful, talented wizards. Due to this preferential treatment, Arthur disliked Slughorn as a result and this relationship with Slughorn was later echoed with Arthur's son, Ron Weasley, as Slughorn ignored Ron the same way he had ignored Arthur. However, considering they both fought against Voldemort's forces in the Battle of Hogwarts, it is possible their opinions on each other eventually changed.

Hogwarts staff
Hogwarts Staff in 1996
Horace Slughorn had a good relationship with most members of the Hogwarts staff. In addition to having been an old friend and long-time colleague of Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, Slughorn was quite friendly with the other members of the Hogwarts staff.

He was quite familiar with Severus Snape, the former Potions Master, and one of his former students. Slughorn possibly considered Snape to be a very intelligent and talented student, and invited him to join his Slug Club. They appeared to have a good relationship even during their later years as professors, until the 1997-1998 school year, after Snape apparently murdered Albus Dumbledore and usurped his position as Headmaster of Hogwarts. However, Slughorn later learned that Snape was, in fact, a loyal member of the Order of the Phoenix.

He was also a friend of Minerva McGonagall, the Transfiguration professor; though the two were heads of rival Houses, that was not a factor likely to affect their relationship, as, like Minerva, Slughorn did not give preferential treatment to the students of his own House. However, the fact that he did give preferential treatment to students based on other things may not have sat terribly well with the Transfiguration professor. However, in 1998, during the Battle of Hogwarts, Minerva told Slughorn that, if he and his students wanted to join Lord Voldemort, she would fight against them. Slughorn was shocked, possibly because he didn't expect McGonagall to believe that he would ever join the Dark Lord. Later in the battle, Minerva and Slughorn together duelled Voldemort directly, and both survived.

Slughorn also had a good relationship with Filius Flitwick and Pomona Sprout. They appeared to be familiar, as they discussed the events of the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and seemed to trust each other. Slughorn, Flitwick and Sprout also witnessed Severus Snape fleeing before the Battle of Hogwarts, and they joined the battle, all of them surviving.

Although the latter claimed they were never close, Horace also appeared to be quite familiar with Rubeus Hagrid. Hagrid might have been one of Slughorn's students during his years at Hogwarts. In 1997, Horace was invited to a funeral Hagrid held for Aragog, his pet Acromantula. They drank and sang together in celebration of Aragog's life (and more likely, his valuable venom, for Slughorn's part), and the occasion afforded Harry Potter the opportunity to retrieve Slughorn's original memory of Tom Riddle asking about Horcruxes. Also they might have become great friends after the funeral, considering he comforted Hagrid during Aragog's funeral which may have meant a lot to Hagrid.

Although the two worked in different years, Slughorn knew of the previous Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge, and having kept track of the goings-on despite going into hiding, he heard that she was dragged into the Forbidden Forest by a herd of centaurs. Upon Dumbledore explaining that she angered the centaurs by storming into the forest herself and calling them "filthy half-breeds", Horace expressed his disdain for her, claiming that she was an "idiotic woman" and that he never liked her and was one of his least favourite students.

Etymology
'Horace' was the name of an epicurean Roman poet, fond of food and someone who liked to make friends with people of influence.
'Eugene' is comes from the Greek εὐγενής (eugenēs), "noble", εὖ (eu), "well" and γένος (genos), "race, stock, kin". As such, the name means literally "well-born".
'Flaccus' was a cognomen of the ancient Roman plebeian family Fulvius, considered one of the most illustrious gentes of the city. As usual for cognomina, "Flaccus" was likely originally a nickname, probably of Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, the founder of the family. It has been variously interpreted as meaning "big ears", "flop ears", "floppy", or "fatty".
Slughorn  - a 'slug' refers to the garden slug, a cousin to the snail but without the shell. Additionally, 'Slughorn' is a historical heraldic term meaning 'war-cry', derived from an old Scottish word and later becoming the modern 'slogan', but may also be derived from his large, sluggish physique.
Behind the scenes

Slughorn in Harry Potter: Wizards Unite
Horace is portrayed by British actor Jim Broadbent in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (voice only) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.
In the film, Horace is depicted in tweed outfits rather than the described velvet, and is not bald, and has no moustache.
Also, the Slughorn depicted in the film is more interested in collecting precious materials such as Tentacula leaves and Acromantula venom or in getting together talented students, rather than in teaching. On the other hand, Slughorn in the books still loves teaching and takes his job very seriously.

In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Rubeus Hagrid mentions to Harry that he "never had a lot to do" with Slughorn, implying the two had never had any interaction with each other. However, seeing as Tom Riddle went to school with Hagrid, it follows to the conclusion that Horace taught Hagrid. As there are teachers and students that never really relate in all walks of life, Hagrid might well have simply been saying that Horace had never had any direct interaction during his time at school.
Slughorn's exact age is never specified, although it is known that he was old enough to teach Tom Riddle (who started Hogwarts in 1938) and younger than Albus Dumbledore (who was born in 1881). If we assume a Potions Master must have finished school at Hogwarts before becoming a teacher, this means Slughorn was born no later than 1920 -- and, in all likelihood, earlier than that, since 17-year-old teachers do not seem to come by very often -- and no earlier than 1881. This means that, at the moment he first met Harry Potter in Budleigh Babberton (mid-July 1996), Slughorn was between 76 and 115 years old, and that at the moment of his permanent retirement he was between 96 and 135 years old. This potentially makes him the second oldest known Hogwarts teacher, only Professor Binns being, supposedly, older than him.
Slughorn's general Modus operandi bares a strong resemblance to the system known as the "old boy network", a system of relationships established between attendees of Male-only elite schools that would continue into their life after graduation. Since students at such schools were generally from the upper classes they were often appointed to high ranking positions in society, and would generally favour schoolmates and do favours for friends. Though this would greatly benefit those in the network it also excluded those who did not have the same opportunities.
Although in the novel of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Horace mentions that he taught Snape, in real life Jim Broadbent (born May 1949) who plays Horace is three years younger than Alan Rickman (born February 1946) who plays Snape.
Horace's direct duel with Voldemort, alongside Minerva McGonagall and Kingsley Shacklebolt is omitted from the film. Instead he takes a swig of something stashed under his cloak, then begins casting protective charms such as Protego Maxima. He is later seen tending to Argus Filch's wounds, and regaling his triumphs in the battle with Filius Flitwick and Pomona Sprout.
In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Harry comes across Horace getting some herbs with the help of Pomona Sprout; in the film, Harry finds him stealing tentacula leaves without her knowledge with the intent of selling them.
One of the names Slughorn calls Ron Weasley is Rupert. As J.K. Rowling wrote the book after the Harry Potter film series began, this might be a nod to Rupert Grint.

Notes and references
 1.0 1.1 1.2 "Horace Slughorn fact file" from Pottermore

 2.0 2.1 2.2 "Short Stories from Hogwarts of Power, Politics and Pesky Poltergeists, Chapter 3 (Horace Slughorn)" reveals that Horace Slughorn began teaching in 1931. Children graduate from Hogwarts when they are (or are about to turn) eighteen. The latest date Slughorn can be born in order to begin teaching in September of the year he graduated is 28 April 1913. The earliest possible birthdate is 1882, as Dumbledore commented in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 4 (Horace Slughorn) that "You're not yet as old as I am, Horace." 

 3.0 3.1 On Writing by J.K. Rowling: "Pure-Blood" at Wizarding World, the Slughorns are mentioned to have been included in the Pure-Blood Directory published in Britain in the 1930s. As Horace Slughorn was already alive by 1930, and given his views, he was likely pure-blood, but also may have been a half-blood in the pure-blood family like some Malfoys - see Writing by J.K. Rowling: "The Malfoy Family" at Wizarding World

 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 17 (A Sluggish Memory) - "Harry was so used to him bald that he found the sight of Slughorn with thick, shiny, straw-colored hair quite disconcerting; it looked as though he had had his head thatched, though there was already a shiny Galleon-sized bald patch on his crown. His moustache, less massive than it was these days, was gingery-blond."

 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 4 (Horace Slughorn) - "His pale gooseberry eyes had found Dumbledore’s injured hand."
