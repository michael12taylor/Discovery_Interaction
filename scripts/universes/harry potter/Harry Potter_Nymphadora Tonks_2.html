<html><p>Tonks' friendship with Harry grew for the next two and a half years. In 1996, Harry hoped Tonks would be among the Aurors sent to escort him to the Hogwarts Express, though she sadly was not. Shortly after, Tonks rescued Harry on the Hogwarts Express; she performed the counter-curse to remove the Full Body-Bind Curse placed on him by Draco Malfoy, healed his broken nose and ensured he reached safety within Hogwarts. She could do this because she had been watching the students exit the train and immediately went to investigate when Harry had not gotten off too, indicating her protectiveness towards him despite her heartache. Harry was disappointed by how gloomy Tonks had become, missing his friend's bubbly nature.

When she married Remus Lupin in 1997, a happier Tonks was sorry that Harry couldn't attend the wedding due to him being required to remain with his Muggle relatives to ensure the protective charm on him held. Later, when Lupin briefly left Tonks, due to fears that the child she carried would be infected with lycanthropy like himself, Harry was furious with him for leaving his family and wanting to leave his friend to raise a baby without its dad. It was largely because of Harry's words that Lupin returned to Tonks. In 1998, when she gave birth to a son named Teddy Lupin, both Tonks and Lupin agreed that Harry would be the godfather. Harry was devastated when he learned that Nymphadora was murdered by her aunt, Bellatrix Lestrange. He noted that the grief he felt over the death of Tonks was akin to a physical wound.

Even after defeating Voldemort, the pain of losing Tonks still affected him and he likely never stopped missing her. In memory of both Tonks and Lupin, Harry acted as a father figure to their orphaned son Teddy. Teddy despite being raised by Tonks' mother, would spend three or four nights a week dining with the Potter and Weasley families.

Molly Weasley
Molly Weasley, a good friend
Tonks and fellow Order member Molly Weasley had a rather close relationship. Though there was a significant difference in age between the two, the pair often confided in one another. Molly often invited Tonks to dine with the Weasley family, and she was always a welcome guest at the events held by the Weasley matriarch. Indeed, Mrs Weasley appeared to be Tonks' closest adult friend. Molly appeared to be the only person that Tonks confided her love of Remus Lupin to, and was noted by Harry as acting somewhat frosty to Lupin during the Christmas holidays, though he misinterpreted the reason why. 

Several people suspected that Molly hoped her son Bill Weasley would fall in love with Tonks, rather than marry Fleur Delacour. For her part, Molly reacted heatedly to disparaging remarks made by Fleur in regards to Tonks, which is indicative of the high opinion she held of Tonks.

At the conclusion of the Battle of Hogwarts, it was Molly who duelled and killed Tonks's murderer, Bellatrix Lestrange. It is likely that Molly knew Teddy Lupin, Nymphadora's son, because Teddy was dating Victoire Weasley, Molly's granddaughter. In addition to this, as Harry Potter's godson, he frequented Harry and Ginny's house.

Hermione Granger and Ginny Weasley
Hermione Granger, her friend
Tonks met Hermione Granger and Ginny Weasley in the summer of 1995. She immediately struck up a friendship with them, acting somewhat like an older sister to the teenagers during their time at Grimmauld Place. Ginny appreciated Tonks since, although she was an adult, she was interested in having fun and taught her how to check if a door had an Imperturbable Charm on it, by flicking objects at the door in question. Hermione liked the fact that Tonks was proof that women could also be successful and get good positions after school. Both liked the fact that she could change her appearance at will, as she entertained them both over dinner by changing her nose into various shapes.

Ginny Weasley, her friend
In 1996, Ginny revealed that she would prefer Tonks rather than Fleur to marry her brother Bill and be part of their family. Ironically, Tonks was, albeit distantly, related to Ginny anyway. Hermione and Ginny felt worried about Tonks being depressed lately, such that it even affected her magical abilities. The two, however, became glad about her marriage with Remus Lupin in mid-1997.

During the Battle of Hogwarts, Tonks and Ginny fought against some Death Eaters. Later, the two girls were very devastated when they found out during the one-hour armistice that Tonks had been murdered, and mourned over her body together along with Remus', Fred's, and over fifty others that had fallen during the battle. It is also possible that Hermione and Ginny provided a surrogate aunt and mother figure, respectively, during the childhood of Tonks' son Teddy, considering that Ginny's husband was Teddy's godfather and served as a father figure to him.

Weasley family
The Weasley family, her friends
Ron Weasley and Tonks became good friends in 1995, when they were both staying at the 12 Grimmauld Place, headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix. Ron liked Tonks and thought she was a nice girl, but less beautiful than Fleur Delacour. However, he acknowledged her funniness and friendliness. Tonks and Ron both fought during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, the Battle of the Seven Potters (where they were paired together and barely escaped from Bellatrix Lestrange), in the Attack at the Burrow, and in the Battle of Hogwarts, where Tonks was murdered by Bellatrix Lestrange. Ron was saddened by her death, and after the war he became a friend of Tonks' son, Teddy.

Tonks had a good relationship with the other members of the Weasley family, too. She seemed to be friendly with the twins Fred and George, as they all were funny and enjoyed having fun. Fred was killed during the final battle, like Tonks was. Their bodies were put near to each other at the Great Hall, as well as the body of Remus Lupin.

Arthur Weasley and Tonks were both members of the Order of the Phoenix and both worked at the Ministry of Magic. They were possibly close to each other, as Tonks was among the ones who visited Arthur at St Mungo's Hospital, when he was bitten by Nagini. After the Battle of the Seven Potters was over, Arthur thanked Tonks and Lupin, because they saved Ron and George. Arthur was saddened by Tonks' death during the Battle of Hogwarts.

Tonks' relationship with Bill, Charlie and Percy is unknown. Being the same age, she may have been friends with Charlie Weasley and this might be why Tonks and the Weasleys are so close. It is also possible that she and Bill were friends as she attempted to help him put away some Order of the Phoenix secrets during 1995, although Molly assumedly wanted them to marry each other. Furthermore, Bill's love for Fleur inspired Tonks to publicly declare her love for Remus. Ironically, Bill and Fleur's daughter Victoire Weasley was known to be dating Tonks' son Teddy in 2017.

Order of the Phoenix
Order of the Phoenix, her allies
Nymphadora Tonks was a good friend of Kingsley Shacklebolt, an auror like her and also one of the most recent members of the Order. They fought together in many battles for the Second Wizarding War. After Tonks was murdered, Kingsley was very sad.

Tonks might have been a friend of Sturgis Podmore, Elphias Doge, Emmeline Vance, Arabella Figg, Hestia Jones, and Mundungus Fletcher, as they had contact through the order. She shared the fate of being one of many members of the Order killed in various battles during the wars. Tonks also knew Aberforth Dumbledore. 

Nymphadora greatly respected Professor Albus Dumbledore, founder and leader of the Order. She also had a good relationship with Minerva McGonagall, as they sat together grieving (along with others) after Dumbledore's death. When Tonks publicly declared her love for Lupin, McGonagall thought that Tonks should marry him, and that Dumbledore would be happy if he knew that there was a little more love in the world.

Severus Snape was Tonks' Potions professor and would therefore have contributed to her becoming an Auror, as a high N.E.W.T. score is required for all major magical subjects. During her years as a Hogwarts student, however, Tonks almost killed Snape by inadvertently throwing a Venemous Tentacula at him. This mishap served to infuriate Snape to such a degree that Tonks deemed him capable of "killing [her]", but, under Pomona Sprout's prompting, he relented to give her permanent detention instead.  In her adulthood, Tonks seemed to have no particular opinion of Snape regarding his loyalty, though it can be assumed that she trusted him because Dumbledore did but did not view him as a friend. In 1996, Snape insulted her wolf Patronus, which by extension was an insult to her love for Lupin. After Snape's murder of Dumbledore, Tonks came to view the former as an enemy. Tonks died before learning of Snape's true loyalty or that he had tried to save her husband during the Battle of the Seven Potters.

Etymology
Nymphadora literally means "Gift of the Nymphs." Nymphs are nature spirits and minor deities in Greek mythology who rule trees, sacred groves, streams and the ocean. During the Renaissance, northern Europeans equated the classical nymphs with their own legends of elves. If we therefore read "gift of the nymphs" as "gift of the elves", this echoes the ancient myth of babies stolen by elves and replaced by hideous monsters called "changelings". 'Nymph' is also the name of the "immature stage of a dragonfly or damselfly before it moults, before metamorphosing into a winged adult". Both meanings could be references to her metamorphosing skills.
A 'Tonk' literally means, 'a fool or idiot', 'a powerful hit or strike'. This could be related to Tonks's clumsiness and ability. The name Tonks may have been taken from notable British painter, art teacher and surgeon Henry Tonks, who combined his artistic and surgical background to record exact images of the various types of facial injuries that occurred among soldiers during World War I. His emphasis on recording, drawing and painting facial features may have led Rowling to choose this surname and more specifically used it to refer to a specific individual who had the ability to change her facial features at will.
Her husband's surname, Lupin, is quite fitting for Tonks: As a Metamorphmagus, she was noted for her ability to change her appearance to adapt or blend in in her work as an Auror, as wolves are one of the most adaptive mammals on the planet. It is a fitting name for someone whose occupation is capturing dark wizards/witches, as wolves are known to serve the needs of their pack above all else, making Tonks somewhat wolf-like herself, not to mention her rebellious personality and that wolves are extremely wild animals. Further similarities between her and wolves include her having been sorted into Hufflepuff (whose dorms and common room are subterranean) much like the dens of wolves, and that she is a relative of Sirius Black (whose Animagus form is that of a dog, a distant cousin of the wolf).

Tonks was the first confirmed Metamorphmagus introduced in canon. Her son Teddy is the second.
Although her common use of the word 'wotcher' suggests that Tonks is from southern England, on the UK editions of the audiobooks Stephen Fry reads her with a strong Lancashire accent.
In Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, if selecting Tonks as the distraction for Madam Irma Pince, and as the person who later accompanied Jacob's sibling, Tulip Karasu, and Barnaby Lee into the Vault of Fear, when meeting up at the Training Grounds, Tonks  brought a pot of baby mandrake for the distraction. She later would reveal that all of the occurring threats caused by Dark Magic had her considering to become an Auror. After practising together, Jacob's sibling told Tonks she could really be an Auror someday, given her being so powerful. Tonks thanked her friend for the compliment, and stated that she started to take things more seriously after their talk.
Considering the birth of Delphini, daughter of Voldemort and Bellatrix, before Battle of Hogwarts, it is possible that the reason Voldemort told Bellatrix to prune her family tree and get rid of Nymphadora was Voldemort's pride, because he didn't want his offspring to have such unworthy relatives, as Tonks would be Delphini's first cousin, half-blood and married to werewolf. Interestingly, it seems that Voldemort never paid any special attention to Bellatrix's niece before, though Tonks was the child from the scandalous marriage between Bellatrix's sister from the noble House of Black and a Muggle-born, as well as being a skilled Auror who fought against his minions. This instruction from the Dark Lord made Bellatrix more eager in deciding that killing Nymphadora was her priority. Delphini was born at the Malfoy Manor, so it is possible that at the moment of the Meeting at Malfoy Manor she already was born or that Bellatrix was in early stages of pregnancy.
J. K. Rowling originally intended for Tonks to survive the Battle of Hogwarts, but chose to have her and Remus die in reparation for giving Arthur Weasley a reprieve in the fifth book.
Though Tonks and Charlie Weasley were in the same year at school, there was no reason to believe they knew each other well before their appearances in Hogwarts Mystery (in which Jacob's sibling is also in their year). Tonks was in Hufflepuff, and Charlie was in Gryffindor.
Despite having a different hair colour in each film that she appears, Tonks only ever has purple hair in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7, but if you play as Tonks and hold the character still for some time, Nymphadora’s hair will temporarily turn orange for only a few moments and eventually return back to purple.
In Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, Tonks is oddly shown to be studying Divination and Muggle Studies at N.E.W.T.-level, despite neither of these two subjects being requirements for Aurors, whilst she is not shown in other classes that are actually standard qualifications for the career.
In films
Tonks is portrayed by Natalia Tena in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Part 2. Coincidentally, Tena shares her character's initials.
During Natalia's audition for the role of Tonks, she tripped over a table and chair giving the impression that she's clumsy (like Tonks). Wherein the director found her energy and humour as the very thing he's looking for, for the role of the young witch.

English actress Anna Friel, who was David Thewlis' common law wife at the time, auditioned for the part of Tonks since the character is romantically linked to Remus Lupin. However, she did not get the role.
Kelly Macdonald was originally asked to play Tonks. She was later cast as Helena Ravenclaw.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, to get Tonks's look, the front part of Natalie Tena's hair was dyed, and the back part was a dyed wig.
In the books, Nymphadora's hair is described as "short and spiky", but in the films it is usually shoulder-length. It is also purple as opposed to pink as the film-makers had associated the colour pink with Professor Dolores Umbridge. It was portrayed as short and brown in the film adaptation of Half-Blood Prince however, as it had been in the book of the same name. It is possible she may be depressed over the death of her cousin Sirius and is having trouble with her morphing like in the book.
Tonks has very little to do in any of the Harry Potter films in which she appears. She has four lines in Order of the Phoenix, four lines in Half-Blood Prince, five lines in DH Part 1 and no lines in DH Part 2 (except in a deleted scene where she has one line). Her romance with Remus, her pregnancy and her Metamorphmagi were not given much light, only being briefly mentioned due to pacing in the films. She is a character that is 'squeezed in,' but loved nevertheless, by her fans.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Tonks isn't seen changing her hair colour the way she does in the books. Instead, it only changes once involuntarily (from purple to red) when she angrily tells Mad-Eye Moody not to call her "Nymphadora." It does briefly change to white when she apparates in during the fight in the Ministry.
In the last film it appears that Tonks is shown in the Quad Battlements with Kingsley, Mr Weasley and her husband Remus, whereas in the books Tonks most likely ran to the grounds to find Remus because that is where Aberforth Dumbledore told her Remus was.
Her shortest appearance to date was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, in which she appeared only in two brief scenes and had no lines. However, a deleted scene shows her being reunited with Remus on The Quad. He tells her that she should be with Teddy, and she responds: "He'll sleep 'till dawn, and snore like his father. It's you that needs me tonight."
Several publicity photos show Tena wearing a blonde wig as Tonks, but she does not do so in any of her four film appearances to date.
On the second disc of the Order of the Phoenix DVD, there is a special feature in which Natalia Tena, in make up, costume and character, gives everyone a tour of the Harry Potter studios and sets. She chats with cast and crew members and plays with props from both the fifth and previous films, practises her duelling and demonstrates her talents as a musician. She does more in this feature than in any of the films.
