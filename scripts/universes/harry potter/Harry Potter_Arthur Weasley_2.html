<html><p>Arthur seemed to like his daughter-in-law, Fleur Delacour. Unlike his wife and daughter, Arthur did not dislike her; after the war, Arthur had three grandchildren through Fleur.

Rubeus Hagrid was a member of the Order and very loyal to Dumbledore. He seemed to know the Weasleys since their earlier years, as they appeared to be friends in 1992. Hagrid told Arthur not to argue with Lucius Malfoy, believing that he was not worth it. Hagrid was also the Care of Magical Creatures professor of Ron and Ginny. The whole Weasley family appeared to be friendly with Hagrid. They were members of the Order who fought together at the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts. They both survived the war.

Arthur had a high opinion of Alastor Moody, whom he had met at the Ministry of Magic. He thought Moody was a little mad but a very powerful and brave Auror, who had captured dozens of Death Eaters. They were friends, as well as members of the second Order. Arthur's children thought Moody was mad, too. Moody led the group of order members that fought at the Battle of the Seven Potters. Moody was killed by Lord Voldemort during the battle. Arthur was sad about his death.

Arthur also seemed to be on good terms with Severus Snape, despite the fact that Snape disliked his children. However, when he learned that Snape killed Dumbledore, he and his family obviously turned against him but that was most likely retracted when he learned of Snape's true loyalties from Harry. In addition, one of Arthur's grandchildren, Albus Potter, was named after Snape. 

Arthur was also friendly with Nymphadora Tonks. Tonks was a young woman, as well as an Auror. Arthur and Tonks also knew each other through the Ministry of Magic. During the Battle of the Seven Potters, Tonks was responsible for Ron, they were paired together. Tonks managed to save herself and Ron from Bellatrix Lestrange, and then Arthur thanked Tonks. She was eventually murdered by Bellatrix during the Battle of Hogwarts. Her dead body was put near Fred and Lupin's, and the Weasleys looked very sad by the deaths of all of them. It is unknown if he had met her son Teddy Lupin, but considering how Teddy was the godson of Arthur's son-in-law Harry, coupled with the fact that by 2017 Teddy was dating Arthur's granddaughter Victoire, it is possible that Teddy and Arthur were on good terms.

He appeared to be a friend of Kingsley Shacklebolt, as well. They were only members of the second Order. They fought together in many battles and survived the Second Wizarding War.

Many members of the Order were killed during battles in both wars; it is likely Arthur got on well with them.

Behind the scenes

Arthur is portrayed by British actor Mark Williams in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Part 2.
Arthur was originally intended to die in either the fifth or seventh book (particularly when Nagini attacked him), but J. K. Rowling decided against it, because he was "one of the few good fathers in the series" and because she didn't want to turn Ron into "half a Harry" i.e. losing one of his parents. Doing so would remove Ron's light hearted comic relief, as most of his humour stems from his immaturity and insensitivity. Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks, two other good parents, were killed off to compensate for this.[25]
There may be a pattern in the Weasley family of naming after characters from Arthurian Legend. King Arthur was a legendary British ruler; the names "Percy" and "Ginny" may also be derived from the legendary figures of Percival and Guinevere, respectively. Ron could have originated from the name of King Arthur's spear.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, he comments to Mr and Mrs Granger "I understand other Muggles are quite afraid of you." This refers to a common Muggle phobia of visiting the dentist, as Mr and Mrs Granger are both dentists.
In the films, Arthur is shown without glasses, and he is not balding, as he is described in the books. In fact, Arthur's hair appears to lengthen as the film series progresses.
He also wears bow-ties in the films, something which was not acknowledged in the novels.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, when Arthur is telling Harry about Sirius Black, Harry uses the name "Voldemort" and Arthur tells him not to say the name; but in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, when Arthur is talking to Harry about Draco Malfoy, Arthur actually says the name "Voldemort."
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Arthur Weasley attended the third task for the Triwizard Tournament. In the book, Arthur was notably the only one of the older Weasley family members that did not attend any of the tasks, with Charlie managing the dragons in the first task, Percy filling in for Crouch Snr in the second task, and Molly and Bill attending as part of the audience during the third task. These four were cut from the film.
In the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, it is Arthur who reads Dumbledore's will and gives the trio what was left for them, rather than Rufus Scrimgeour.
It is revealed in the sixth book that his greatest ambition is learning how aeroplanes stay up.
Based on how Arthur developed his skills in automotive engineering and other skills in muggle machinery, it can be assumed that he has a kinesthetic learning style - in that he learns best by doing rather than simply analysing. This is supported by his very hands-on way of going about things, somewhat overly enthusiastic personality, and borderline need to challenge himself.

↑ Although it has never been directly confirmed that Septimus and Cedrella are Arthur's parents, this can be inferred based on Sirius Black's statement in Ch. 6 of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix that Arthur was "something like [his] second cousin once removed." The Black family tree establishes Cedrella as a first cousin once removed of both Orion and Walburga Black, Sirius's parents. Thus, any children she had would be their second cousins, and second cousins once removed of their sons Sirius and Regulus. Also, almost all of Sirius's relatives can be seen on the Black family tree because both his parents were born into the House of Black, making it unlikely that he could be related to Arthur in a way not shown. See also this talk page and an HPL essay for more information. Additionally, the Gobstones with Charlie Weasley activity in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery states Charlie's grandmother is named Cedrella Weasley.
