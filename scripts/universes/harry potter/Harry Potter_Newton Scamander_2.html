<html><p>Magical mastery: Newt, despite his awkward behaviour and initial lack of recognition, proved himself to be an exceptionally skilled and powerful wizard, worthy of being deemed the favourite student of Albus Dumbledore, with a considerable amount of magical knowledge and variety of proficient skills that afforded him a highly versatile skillset and allowed him to handle numerous dangerous situations effectively. In addition to being a famous Magizoologist who was capable of facing and handling some of the most dangerous beasts in the world and contributed deeply to the advancement of the magical field, Newt's magical abilities were secretly acknowledged by the Ministry of Magic and deemed surpassing enough that they repeatedly offered to make him an Auror out of a true belief that he would make an exceptional one, and even his war hero brother and the international wizarding committee that included even the abrasive Torquil Travers along with Rudolph Spielman and Arnold Guzman deemed him as being magically competent and strong enough to function as an efficient one, despite Newt's personality and repeated refusal, the committee going as far as to use his international travel rights as leverage to try to convince him to participate in the Global wizarding war and help hunt down Gellert Grindelwald, even being the first candidate to the mission of hunting down the extremely powerful Credence Barebone, and as an active participant, was able to offer remarkable contributions to the end of the global wizarding war, including even surviving at least two encounters with Gellert Grindelwald, once managing to hold him at bay just enough for Credence to save him and also being the only reason why he was captured when he was fighting an entire squad of aurors and easily winning in said encounter and later aiding his brother, future wife, and Leta in holding up against the Dark Wizard, at which point he also effectively aided Theseus, Tina, Yusuf and Nicolas Flamel in saving Paris.
Care of Magical Creatures: From a young age, Newt was already quite interested in Magizoology and highly talented, known for having excelled in his studies on the field as a Hogwarts student and acquired extensive knowledge of magical creatures which secured him a position in the Ministry of Magic's Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures before being transferred to the Beast Division merely two years after being inside the Office for House-Elf Relocation and advancing at a meteoric rate, quickly achieving a series of prestigious promotions and becoming so well-regarded as to be tasked to write the first edition of the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Augustus Worme. His travels around the world allowed him to expand his knowledge and skill to phenomenal levels as he acquired complete understanding of many magical creatures through the world, earning a famous reputation for being one of the greatest Magizoologists in the world as he contributed so much to the advancement of Magizoology that he was awarded an Order of Merlin Second Class and honoured with a Chocolate Frog Card named after him, his book displaying thorough knowledge of many of the beasts and creatures in the wizarding world, both dangerous and non-dangerous. Newt's exceeding talents in Magizoology and knowledge gave him a natural way to handle animals in a manner most wizards do not, having an innate ability to communicate and bond with beasts of all shapes, such as Thunderbirds and Bowtruckles — treating the latter much like a parent would a child. This was also displayed by how he was the only one capable of reasoning with the Ukrainian Ironbelly out of all the squad members sent to recruit the dragons. Newt's skill in Magizoology was such that he was even capable of using such beasts for numerous purposes and could fully control even dangerous beasts, such as using the Swooping Evil to aid him in combat by either pinning enemies or catching them off-guard, a Zouwu to easily dispatch the Matagots of the French Ministry of Magic and teleport to the Lestrange Mausoleum in an instant in time to intercept Credence, and even using his Niffler to steal from Gellert Grindelwald the blood pact vial of him and Dumbledore. His knowledge was also noteworthy and could effortlessly and swiftly come up with methods to restrain or tame such dangerous beasts on his own, as shown with his ability to readily retrieve the creatures who escaped from his case, his taming of the highly dangerous Zouwu by using a toy, his quick solving of Yusuf Kama's problems with a water dragon parasite, and his instant recognition of the Matagots and knowledge of how to deal with them.
Charms: Newt was exceptionally accomplished in charm-work. Highly adept in the use of simple and moderate charms, he repeatedly successfully performed the Summoning Charm at rather complicated and difficult situations, able to summon an egg from across a room with a man still holding onto it, simultaneously pull his Niffler and the jewellery he was stealing to him, effortlessly summon in an instant Jacob's jacket from the upper levels of his house while Newt himself was far below on his secret dungeon of creatures, instantly summon his Niffler from his suitcase and easily cast it while also riding on the Zouwu to summon his suitcase.  He also easily repaired the entire upper half of Jacob Kowalski's apartment in mere seconds. Newt used the Wand-Lighting Charm to illuminate Yusuf's infected eye to clearly see the water parasite inside it. Newt's mastery of the Shield Charm was incredible, able to instantly manifest powerful magical shields with ease and was powerful enough to even counter spells cast by Gellert Grindelwald himself, as shown by how he fended off Grindelwald's fierce lightning attacks and even later on his dark blue fire both by himself and alongside Theseus, and his proficiency with the General Counter-Spell also allowed him to aid Nicolas Flamel, Tina Goldstein, Yusuf Kama and Theseus in containing said blue fire. He easily cast such a powerful Windy Spell on Stebbins that it not only stopped him in his tracks but also blew him backwards in the opposite direction, and later cast a charm that released a stream of wind to dry Jacob's clothes. Newt's skill with charms was displayed fully by how he thoroughly enchanted his suitcase, performing the Undetectable Extension Charm on the interior of his suitcase to expansive levels, creating enough space to hold many magical creatures in replicas of their native habitats, and displaying sufficient command of Atmospheric Charms to create weather conditions such as hot desserts and frozen snowcaps for certain creatures, leaving the likes of Tina and Queenie quite impressed with the magic of his suitcase. His abilities even made him capable of creating a magical bubble to contain and sustain an Obscurus, even after the death of its host. Newt was capable of performing the advanced Memory Charm to alter the memories of Muggles who witnessed magic, which he used to erase the memory of an unidentified hobo in 1926. He even used the advanced Confundus Charm effortlessly on a muggle guard strong enough to affect his behaviour and last for minutes. He also effortlessly and swiftly removed a powerful love enchantment that Queenie placed on Jacob with a simple wave of his wand. Newt also displayed excellent skill in the usage of revealing and tracking charms, making use of the Revelio Charm to bypass Grindelwald's Human Transfiguration and later flawlessly making use of several spells in his efforts to find clues on Tina, successfully using a Tracking spell to display magical traces of activities related to his future wife, performing Revelio to reveal the footsteps of a Zouwu, and then performing Avenseguim to track the origins of the feather possessed by Yusuf Kama back at him.
Transfiguration: Newt was at least decently accomplished in this difficult form of magic. He was able to easily transform a window opening into a jelly-like substance to trap his Niffler, temporarily transfigure his wand into a listening device to pick up on the voices of a Zouwu's footsteps, and conjure a lasso of gelatinous substance to bind Grindelwald. He also placed a transfiguration enchantment that would turn the insides of his suitcase into that of fitting muggle objects.
Defence Against the Dark Arts: As one would expect for being a favourite student of Albus Dumbledore back when he held the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts, Newt was outstandingly skilful and knowledgeable at defending himself against the Dark Forces. Acknowledged by both his war hero and Head Auror brother Theseus and even the abrasive Travers, Spielman, and Guzman, Newt was often sought and offered the position of an Auror, despite his repeated refusals, believing he would have been an excellent Auror. It should be noted that Newt had not even graduated, which could be a further testament to his mastery. His mastery of such practices were put to good use during his participation in the global wizarding war, having survived many years involved in the hunt for Gellert Grindelwald, presumably having fought and defeated many of Grindelwald's followers, and he was even capable of surviving at least two subsequent duels with the arguably greatest dark wizard of all time himself. In the first duel, he was able to, even if barely, successfully repel Grindelwald's lightning curses long enough for Credence to transform. During his second altercation with the fearsome Dark Wizard, Newt alone protected himself Grindelwald's tremendously powerful black fire while many Aurors proved to be easily killed by it, although he was not able to bypass it and prevent Credence from joining Grindelwald, and later alongside Theseus fought the Dark Wizard's devastating spell off long enough to be saved by Leta as well as successfully forcing off wild outbursts of it on his own when Grindelwald was not focusing the flames on him. He also was easily able to swiftly follow Nicolas Flamel's instructions on how to overcome said dark magic fire, by collectively casting the General Counter Spell with his brother, Yusuf, his future wife and also Nicolas, allowing them to contain and extinguish the fire and therefore prevented it from the destroying the whole city of Paris. Newt's competence in this field was even enough to handle the extremely powerful dark force of Obscuruses, as he had the ability to extract an Obscurus from its Obscurial and keep it from causing any harm by isolating it inside a bubble, a feat that even Grindelwald himself found to be impressive. Newt was also confident in his ability to handle even Credence Barebone's Obscurial abilities, and Dumbledore himself believed Newt would be capable of saving Credence from his Obscurus, while Theseus and the international committee believed he would have the ability to overcome Credence.
Nonverbal magic: Newt was shown to be fully capable of using magic non-verbally, a testament to his actually considerable magical skills. He was able to summon an Occamy egg held in Jacob Kowalski's hand without saying the incantation, ending up sending Jacob flying towards him at great speed, turn a window opening into a jelly-like substance to trap his Niffler, use a mind-altering spell on muggles that saw his creatures break out of Jacob Kowalski's apartment, and also aid Yusuf, Nicolas, Theseus and Tina in containing the blue fire left by Grindelwald without speaking a word. He also proved quite capable of wordlessly using offensive and defensive magic spells, such as when he deflected Grindelwald's attacks and countered with his own as well as conjured a lasso of a gelatinous substance to restrain Grindelwald after distracting him with his Swooping Evil and later held off Grindelwald's blue fire alongside Theseus without speaking a word.
Apparition: Newt proved to be quite skilled in Apparition, as he was able to successfully Apparate in many different situations, including on the air, and even made use of it to avoid the violent attacks from an Obscurus as well as Gellert Grindelwald.
Herbology: Newt was also proficient in looking after magical flora and was familiar with their properties, keeping several potted plants on a shelf in his shed in the magically expanded suitcase. After Jacob Kowalski suffered a "slightly more severe reaction" than Newt had known anyone else to have after he was was bitten by a Murtlap that escaped Newt's case, Newt used plants and the contents of various bottles to create a poultice, and successfully stopped the No-Maj's fever-like sweating.
Healing magic: Newt was quite adept and knowledgeable in Healing Magic, as he could easily recognise and identify the nature of and prepare medicinal remedies to cure the symptoms of creature-induced injuries, such as he did when he treated Jacob Kowalski's bite from a Murtlap and the subsequent symptoms. He also had various pills for the same purpose available and knew which ones had what effects upon consumption.
Potions: Newt was quite knowledgeable and accomplished in potions, particularly those that used parts of magical creatures as ingredients, writing down notes about it in his books and also successfully experimenting with novel potions such as uses for Swooping Evil venom, diluting its poisonous properties to create a brew that could erase memories. He was also capable of successfully brewing the complex Polyjuice Potion in order to disguise himself as his brother, a particularly complex and advanced brew, showing his impressive abilities in this field.
Duelling: Beguiling his peaceful disposition, Newt was an exceptional duellist, being considerably proficient with both offensive and defensive spells. His skills in duelling were acknowledged by even duellists on the level of his war hero brother Theseus and the abrasive members of the international committee, including the likes of Torquil Travers, being regularly offered the chance to become an Auror, going as far as to resort to holding his right to international travel as leverage in order to recruit him as an active participant of the global wizarding war, even being tasked to slay the extremely powerful Credence, and surviving in such a conflict for years hunting down Grindelwald and the Alliance. He seamlessly used the Full Body-Bind Curse on No-Maj Gilbert Bingley upon nearly being arrested and easily overpowered a Ministry agent watching him. Newt was also confident that he would be fully capable of handling Queenie Goldstein if it came to it when they were arguing over the enchantment she placed on Jacob, and Queenie, indeed having seen Newt's memories and his duelling feats, was intimidated enough to back down rather than duel Newt. Newt's skills in duelling were good enough to overcome multiple enemies simultaneously: He swiftly defeated 3 trained MACUSA Aurors and overpowered many of Grindelwald's allies during Grindelwald's rally in Paris. Newt was even skilled enough in magical combat to be capable of temporarily holding his ground against the extraordinarily powerful Gellert Grindelwald himself and surviving encounters with him, putting up a better fight than Tina did when he was disguised as Percival Graves, avoiding an oncoming curse after being knocked down and firing a white offensive spell at him in return, although it was easily deflected, for a time repelling Grindelwald's attacks, before being swiftly knocked down by a particularly powerful shock wave of electricity but still able to hold off Grindelwald's attempts to torture him by blue lightning bolts, lasting long enough for Credence to distract Grindelwald and having not suffered any noteworthy injury, Newt managed to blind-side and subdue the aforementioned Dark Wizard from behind when he was preoccupied fighting against a small army of MACUSA Aurors, and later duelling Grindelwald once again in Paris alongside Theseus, Leta, and Tina and fending him off enough to escape without any injuries. Newt also displayed some noteworthy skill in physical combat, as deprived of his wand, Newt was able to overpower the guards who were about to execute him and Tina, easily punching down a male guard and turning a female executioner's wand against another one.
History of Magic: Newt also had knowledge of magical history, especially of Magizoology. A whole chapter of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was devoted to the definitions of beasts, beings, and spirits and how the definitions have evolved in past centuries.
Knowledge of the muggle world: Newt displayed a considerable amount of knowledge on Muggles that allowed him to effectively and flawlessly interact with Muggles of many countries while on his adventures and keep his magical abilities a secret, able to conduct his usually dangerous activities without earning the suspicion or attention of Muggles most of the time. He had particular expertise on Muggle topics related to Beasts, displaying complete knowledge on history of Muggles related to Beasts as well as how Muggles reacted to magical creatures and how beasts included in muggle fairy tales, like fairies, differed from real ones, knowing about Muggles' awareness of Diricawl and that they believed that they hunted it to extinction, writing a whole chapter in his book about Muggle awareness of beasts, and even displayed knowledge on the physiology of Muggles when faced with magic, stating how differently the bodies of Muggles react to magic and giving Jacob some armour when dealing with a Erumpent for protection.
Wandlore: Newt had some knowledge of the properties of wand cores, including Thunderbird tail feathers.
Love: Despite all of Newt's complicated past and his preference of the company of magical creatures more than fellow human beings, he proved to be capable of remarkably strong love. Newt's love for his magical creatures lead to him occasionally tending to and keeping them as good pets rather than dangerous and he refused to put them down even when faced with the possibility of MACUSA's retaliation. Newt was also fully capable of feeling genuine love and attachment to others: He  clearly cared deeply for his friends, family, and the whole wizarding world. It was his ability to love that gave him the willingness to take the blame for Leta's actions despite the fact that he would be expelled for it and even with their complicated past and his bitterness towards her and Theseus's relationship, Newt still loved them and was willing to accept their marriage and even be their best man to support their happiness, comfort Leta over her self-loathing and guilt of accidentally killing her brother, fight alongside Theseus and Leta against Grindelwald, and repair his relationship with Theseus after Leta's sacrifice, ultimately leading to him siding against Grindelwald despite his previous refusal. Newt's love for Tina also allowed him to muster the determination to break the rules and travel to Paris despite the international travel ban placed on him and the strength of his feelings for her allowed him to put up with her bitterness and ultimately confess to her, eventually leading to their marriage. Newt was even successful in sympathising with and comforting Credence Barebone out of his Obscurus form, though tragically ended up failing due to Grindelwald's intervention and MACUSA's subsequent attack on him, and Dumbledore specifically sent Newt after Credence believing he would be capable of giving Credence the love needed to cure him of the Obscurus inside him.
Indomitable willpower: Newt, despite his awkwardness, wielded immense willpower and bravery. He proved himself to be fully capable of standing up to others when needed, even if they were of high authority, and firmly maintaining his morality, as shown by how he adamantly refused to hunt down Credence Barebone when asked to by Torquil Travers, Arnold Guzman, and Rudolph Spielman despite their offer to restore his right to travel, and despite being bound, was quick to stand up to Gellert Grindelwald in his Percival Graves disguise when he insinuated that Newt was working For the Greater Good, something that actually impressed the Dark wizard. Indeed, he was admired by Albus Dumbledore himself for his uncanny willingness to do what is right no matter the cost, as displayed by his willingness to accept Dumbledore's safe-house address and then go on to ultimately travel to Paris illegally to not only seek Tina out but also save Credence, and despite seeing horrific visions of a future Second World War, Newt demonstrated his incorruptible spirit and morals by resisting Grindelwald's persuasive speech, maintaining a brave face whereas all other participants of the rally and even Jacob, a veteran of the World War I, were all genuinely terrified, instead valiantly fighting against the Dark wizard's black fire, and, inspired by Leta's sacrifice, officially joining the global wizarding war efforts against him.
Physical aptitude: Newt was in excellent physical condition, supporting a surprisingly muscular built despite his awkward appearances. He was physically strong and fast enough to be able to overtake several executioners of MACUSA without a wand, knocking one out with a single punch and moving faster than a female executioner can point her wand at him to turn the spell against another executioner. Newt also had astonishing levels of physical resilience and durability, having survived tangling with some of the most dangerous creatures in the wizarding world with only a few scars and he even quickly rebounded from being a hit by a spell from Gellert Grindelwald with no injuries and then withstood some lightning curses from Grindelwald and being knocked to the ground by Credence's attacks with only minor pain and no lasting harm and injury.
Detective skills: Despite his socially awkward personality, from his experiences with many of the most dangerous and obscure beasts, having successfully discovered and solved their problems, Newt had shown himself to possess formidably sharp and intuitive deduction skills. He was able to quickly make an accurate deduction of where his creatures would go after they escaped his case and see through their attempts to hide themselves with ease. From his interactions with Grindelwald while he was disguised as Percival Graves, Newt was able to correctly deduce the true identity of the man as being the greatest Dark Wizard himself in disguise. With just a few clues provided by Graves and seeing Credence's power, despite never interacting with Credence before, he was able to figure out right away that Credence was the Obscurial, along with also coming up with the correct calculation that Credence was able to survive far longer than normal because he possessed immense amounts of magical raw power. Newt even figured out Dumbledore's subtle manipulations that sent him to New York and was perceptive enough to even pick up on Dumbledore's reasons of not fighting Grindelwald from how he spoke of it, deducing that something was preventing Dumbledore, and instantly figured out that it was because of the Blood Pact between them the moment he lay his eyes on the vial Grindelwald had. Newt was also able to swiftly deduce from Jacob's abnormal behaviour and Queenie's frustration with the illegality of her relationship with Jacob that she had enchanted her boyfriend so he would accept to be married.
Resourcefulness and strategical aptitude: Despite his principals of not worrying or planning too much, when pushed, Newt proved to be a considerably talented and resourceful strategist. With only a minimum amount of resources at hand, he has proven able to repeatedly come up with numerous plans on the fly quite quickly that has successfully saved the day, making maximum use of anything he had in his disposal to great effect, and his calmness in the face of danger and tactical genius allows him to swiftly adapt or shift his plans to match situations where the condition has changed. While wandless, Newt swiftly managed to use his creatures to turn the tides against the executioners and save both himself and Tina, quickly breaking Tina out of the euphoria stupor she was induced to by breaking the illusion of her happy memory and then coming up with a plan accurately timed to rescue her from the Death potion using the Swooping Evil before using it to swiftly escape from MACUSA. During his hunt to recapture the creatures that escaped from his suitcase, Newt came up with numerous plans and adapted them to fit the situation when faced with unexpected setbacks, successfully retrieving them without causing major damage. Knowing he could not possibly defeat Grindelwald in a fair fight, Newt opted to wait until Grindelwald had started fighting the Aurors until he used his Swooping Evil to catch him off-guard and restrain him, becoming subsequently the first person to capture the infamous Dark Wizard. Newt also came up with a successful plan to leave Britain and go against his international ban by hiring an illegal Portkey provider, knowing it's the only way to leave without the Ministry's watchful eyes preventing him and upon arriving on his destination, quickly came up with a plan in order to find a clue to Credence's location and his identity and infiltrate the French Ministry of Magic by disguising himself as Theseus and avoiding attention from all but Theseus himself, only being caught by Leta and subsequently Mesuline in the end and swiftly coming up with a plan to escape by using the Zouwu he had acquired previously. Newt even swiftly came up with a plan to outsmart Grindelwald once more by taking the blood pact from him using his Niffler when Grindelwald was kneeling down and focused on martyring a girl, a success that would ultimately prove most crucial in the end of the global wizarding war.
Leadership skills: As acknowledged by Dumbledore himself, Newt's desire to only do the right thing no matter what and lack of lust for power meant he was naturally suited to be a leader and had the potential to excel more than Dumbledore did, as while Dumbledore had sought power in his youth and only realised the mistakes of his approach to leadership after a great tragedy, subsequently avoiding anything too demanding, Newt always never sought power but would accept the burden of command and take responsibility for those who "followed" him no matter how uncomfortable he was in the prospect while subsequently proving effective. Indeed, while not often employing this trait due to working alone, he quickly displayed an innate talent for leadership and charisma when it came to himself, Tina, Jacob, and Queenie until her defection to Grindelwald's side, inspiring them to follow his instructions and showing decent skills as a leader during their hunt for the magical creatures that escaped from his suitcase and taking the lead between himself and Jacob or himself and Tina during their escapades in Paris, succeeding in both times. Newt was also trusted by Dumbledore to found an army of skilled wizards and witches and lead the group against Grindelwald's Alliance.
Author skills: Newt was an exceptional author when it came to writing books related to magical creatures, with tireless passion, famous particularly for having been the one who wrote the top-quality creatures book of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which contained detailed information regarding many magical creatures in existence, and continuing to develop special editions that were greatly desired and used by thousands of wizards and witches. He also authorised A Children's Anthology of Monsters for readers of young age.
Possessions
Newt's wand
Wand: Newt's wand was an of an unknown length, wood and core. Newt wielded his wand throughout his life and career, and was able to perform very powerful magic indeed with it.
Newt's enchanted suitcase
Suitcase: A magical suitcase enchanted with an Undetectable Extension Charm in which he held a number of beasts while he travelled. He could hide the contents from Muggles by flipping a switch on the case. In 1926, whilst visiting the United States of America, the beasts in Newt's suitcase escaped, whereupon he was accosted by Percival Graves, a powerful MACUSA Auror and right-hand man of the American wizarding community's leader, Seraphina Picquery. The suitcase contains its own world with many different habitats for each creature. It also contains a place for Newt himself. Tina takes the suitcase with Newt inside it to MACUSA headquarters where she tells them about the creatures that have escaped.
Passport: Newt possessed a Muggle passport during his worldwide travels, which he used to disguise himself as one to the Muggle authorities when passing international border controls.
Relationships
Family
Theseus Scamander
Theseus Scamander, Newt's older brother
Newt's confident, successful and worldly older brother was, in so many ways, the polar opposite to Newt himself. The relationship between the two of them as children is unknown, but the fact that they chose woefully different career paths is a hint that their differences went back as far as childhood. 

By adulthood, Newt's relationship with Theseus seemed to be very complex: Theseus openly confided in Newt about the dangers of Grindelwald and Newt in return seemed to tolerate his brother enough to accept letters from him and also heed his advice, which helped in his dealings with Grindelwald disguised as Graves. Theseus earning the love of his life, Leta Lestrange, left Newt even more distant towards his brother. His attitude towards his brother seemed to be a mixture of annoyance and politeness, being not openly hostile towards him but at the same time making it bluntly clear he had no inclination to follow around him and Leta nor live up to Theseus's expectations, along with being quite uncomfortable with Theseus's shows of affection and frequent hugs. He also did not hesitate to use a polyjuice potion to take on Theseus's form despite the possible repercussions it would have on his brother and when Tina overpowered Theseus in Paris, Newt remarked that witnessing it might be the greatest moment of his life, showing there was a part of Newt that resented Theseus. Despite this, however, Newt proved capable of putting aside their differences when push came to shove and he had to work with his brother, fighting side-by-side very effectively in Paris when battling against Grindelwald. The relationship finally got mended after the battle, as Newt actually comforted Theseus after Leta's death (as Leta was someone they both cared immensely about) and revealed that he had finally chosen a side to fight on. Later, Theseus persuaded the other Aurors to allow Newt and Dumbledore to speak alone.

Porpentina Goldstein
Porpentina Goldstein, Newt's love interest and wife
Porpentina Goldstein was arguably the love of Newt's life. The two got off to a bad start after she followed Newt around while he caused trouble in a bank, and she kept having to demand that he take action since he clearly didn't want to. Eventually, not knowing his suitcase had been accidentally swapped with Jacob's, she turned him in to MACUSA for the threat he was unintentionally posing to New York. When Percival Graves saw confectionery instead of magical beasts while checking the suitcase, they left the MACUSA building together to find New's suitcase. When they did it, Tina offered Newt accommodation in her and her sister's apartment, but it didn't improve their relationship much, especially since Goldstein did it only because of the sick Jacob Kowalski, who had been bitten by one of the beasts which escaped from the suitcase, and also to be able to keep an eye on Newt.

However, after they were both arrested and Newt saved her life, their relationship began to improve, as Tina began to understand why a man could depend on magical beasts. With time, Newt became more and more conscious of Tina's virtues, seeing that she was a good-hearted person and that her previous desire to report his misdeeds to the superiors might have resulted from ignorance and willingness to prove that she could return to an Auror position. Quests to search for the lost magical beasts, as well as their joint efforts while trying to defeat the Obscurus and even the capture of Gellert Grindelwald (while disguised Percival Graves), brought the two closer together. After the capture of Grindelwald, Newt told Seraphina Picquery about Tina's actions, which resulted in her being restored as an Auror, for which Tina was extremely grateful to him. At the time of his departure, Newt said he was going to publish a book and Tina briefly asked him if Leta Lestrange, the girl he once loved, liked to read. Newt only answered that he didn't really know what Leta liked these days, because people changed - and he had probably changed too. Tina promised to buy his book, and joyfully accepted when Newt asked if he could come back and give her a copy in person.

Due to his subsequent travel ban, Newt couldn't return to visit Tina and give her the book, so he had corresponded with her by letter, but a series of missteps on Newt's part, namely his accidental denunciation of Aurors as "career-driven hypocrites", had soured the relationship. Their relationship got even colder when Tina read an article in Spellbound, which had reported on the launch party of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and falsely stated that Newt was engaged to Leta Lestrange. The belief that Newt had rekindled his relationship with Leta was too much for Tina, and she broke off contact with Newt and started seeing a fellow Auror named Achilles Tolliver. When he learned that Credence had survived and Grindelwald escaped from MACUSA's prison in order to find him, Newt was ordered by Albus Dumbledore to go to Paris, where Credence was believed to be hiding. Newt refused, but when he learned from Queenie that Tina was also there to find Credence, he travelled to France without hesitation. Newt was determined to have Tina learn the truth, although she remained cold with him, insisting on calling him "Mr Scamander". Nevertheless, Newt eventually managed to subtly confess his feelings for her, awkwardly stating that she had "eyes like a salamander". The two worked together once again when Grindelwald was summoning his followers.

Newt and Tina got married at some point after the 1920s, and had at least one child, likely a son. In the 1990s, Newt and Tina were living together in Dorset with their three pet Kneazles, Hoppy, Milly and Mauler, and had at least one grandson, Rolf Scamander.

Newt and Tina became great-grandparents after Rolf's wife, Luna Lovegood, gave birth to twin boys named Lorcan and Lysander. In 2017, Newt was still living with Tina in Dorset at the age of 118.

Albus Dumbledore
Albus Dumbledore and Newt Scamander talking in London
Newt's relationship with Albus Dumbledore was very close. During Newt's time at Hogwarts, Dumbledore was his Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor and among the very few who didn't look down on him, which started Newt's respect for the great professor. When one of Leta Lestrange's experiments involving a magical beast went too far, endangering the life of another student. Newt did not want to see a friend thrown out of school, so he took the blame for Leta's actions, and was thus sentenced to be expelled from Hogwarts in her place. Newt developed unending trust and loyalty to Dumbledore after he argued strongly against his expulsion. It is unclear whether the expulsion was enforced or not, or if it was temporary or permanent. However, Newt was allowed to keep his wand.

After school Newt probably was in a regular contact with his teacher. Newt respected his mentor enough to do tasks for him. Dumbledore told him where to find one ill-bred Thunderbird and later sent his former student to New York to release this beast, whose natural environment was Arizona. At this time Newt helped capture Gellert Grindelwald, who was trying to convince Obscurial Credence Barebone to join his ranks. Newt was extremely loyal to Dumbledore, because when he appealed to his travel ban, he lied to the committee members that he had gone to the United States on his orders. When Grindelwald managed to escape, Albus felt that he would not be able to fight the dark wizard, so he asked Scamander for help. Dumbledore admired him, because he didn't care about power or popularity, something that Newt did not understand as he was not aware of Dumbledore's past that made him realise his initial views was a foolish man's dream and that Dumbledore meant Newt could have become a leader even greater than himself. He sent Newt to Paris to rescue Credence, who survived battle in New York, but Newt was reluctant, nevertheless he was willing to accept the address of a safe-house. The rumours of Newton's potential travel to France reached the British Ministry of Magic, and a delegation, including Newt's brother Theseus Scamander, Leta Lestrange and Torquil Travers, was sent to Hogwarts Castle to question Dumbledore. Albus only pretended that he did not know anything about it and said that Newt was not a great follower of orders. During the Battle in Lestrange family Mausoleum, vial of Dumbledore's and Grindelwald's blood pact was stolen from Grindelwald, however, without his knowledge by a Niffler belonging to Newt Scamander. Shortly thereafter Scamander brought it to Dumbledore at Hogwarts. Dumbledore expressed regret at Leta's death in mausoleum. Newt in turn did not ask Dumbledore why he would form a blood pact with Grindelwald but simply asked him to destroy it, showing respect for his privacy. Although it apparently took years, Dumbledore clearly managed to abolish the blood pact, allowing him to finally defeat Grindelwald in a legendary duel.

Jacob Kowalski
Jacob Kowalski, his good Muggle friend
The friendship between Newt and Jacob was the result of a pure luck encounter, as they both found themselves in the same bank, albeit for different reasons. Jacob was associated with Newt's quest for his lost creatures from the beginning, as he inadvertently took Newt's magical case full of creatures instead of his own, causing the escape of some magical beasts. Newt finally found Jacob, who had been bitten by a Murtlap, and agreed to remain with the No-Maj until he was healed. Over the dinner they had with Tina and Queenie Goldstein, Newt remarked how easy it was for Jacob to be appreciated by people, something Newt had trouble with since most people found him annoying. Newt and Jacob progressively bonded with each other, and once they successfully recaptured an Erumpent, Newt was told by Jacob to call him by his first name instead of "Mr Kowalski". In the aftermath of the arrest of Gellert Grindelwald in New York, while Jacob was on the verge of being obliviated, he asked Newt why he had kept him around for so long, to which Newt simply replied that he liked Jacob and considered him a friend.

Newt and Jacob reconnected months later, and Newt immediately sensed that something was wrong with Jacob, who was under the influence of a spell by Queenie. Newt demanded that Jacob was released from the spell in order to freely make his own choices. Newt and Jacob teamed up once again in the former's quest for Credence Barebone, the two of them mentioning how difficult their relationships with the women they loved (Tina and Queenie) could be. Jacob also gave Newt advice on how he should compliment Tina once they would have found her.

Queenie Goldstein
Queenie Goldstein, a good friend
Queenie met Newt when he, along with Jacob Kowalski, were brought to her apartment by her sister Tina. The man at first a bit reluctantly accepted Queenie's hospitality, but he did not refuse her and put up at their home. Their relationship quickly warmed and the woman joined in helping to catch the beasts that escaped from his suitcase. Queenie helped to transport Newt, Tina and Jacob from MACUSA, and she volunteered to stop the Obscurus threatening the city. When Queenie found out that he missed Leta Lestrange, she consoled him that she could only take, and he deserved someone better. Scamander couldn't fully open himself to Queenie, and the awareness of her magical reading skills in the mind drank him. Nevertheless, they had good relationships and could rely on each other.

Months later, Queenie with Jacob visited Newt in London. Newt was sad seeing that Tina didn't come with them and Queenie informed him that Tina was in Paris to look for Credence Barebone. She stated that her sister is heartbroken and showed him a copy of Spellbound magazine which ran a mistaken cover story on Newt's supposed engagement to Leta Lestrange. Queenie stated that she doesn't talk with her sister and tell magizoologist that she and Jacob were engaged and planned to be married. Newt was put off with Queenie's over-eagerness and Jacob's awkward demeanour, until he realised that Queenie had cast a powerful love charm on Jacob and was planning to illegally marry Jacob. This quickly made Newt furious with Queenie and seeing through her half-hearted efforts to defend herself, immediately prepared to cast the counter-spell on Jacob, refusing to let Jacob continue to be forced under Queenie's whims and also to prevent Queenie from punishment. Indicating that he would be willing to duel her if necessary, Queenie was intimidated enough to back down and Newt lifted the spell. Jacob refused to marry her, in fear of Queenie would be punished for marriage with him. As a result of this, Queenie felt betrayed by Newt and Jacob, though she may have also been afraid of Newt's clear anger when he realised Queenie really did go that far, so she left London and headed to Paris to find Tina, leaving two men in quest to find both sisters in France. During Grindelwald's rally in Lestrange family Mausoleum, Queenie joined the dark wizard's side, which saddened Newt.

Gellert Grindelwald
Gellert Grindelwald, his mortal enemy
Being the reigning Dark Wizard of Newt's time, Newt had heard a lot about Grindelwald and already strongly disapproved, of his views but he did not support the Ministry's act against him. Unbeknownst to him at first, he would meet Grindelwald while he was disguised as Percival Graves in New York. Grindelwald, not impressed by Newt's love for creatures or his magical skills, questioned him on why Dumbledore would be fond of him despite his unique traits, having known of Dumbledore's strong argument on Newt's expulsion, although Newt did not know why himself. Grindelwald seemed to have wanted to continue to talk about Dumbledore. Newt quickly began to dislike Grindelwald's reminder of his expulsion at Hogwarts and this increased even further when Grindelwald indicated Newt was working for the Greater Good, causing him to outrageously say that he wasn't one of Grindelwald's fanatics, which surprisingly not only didn't offend the Dark Wizard but even caused him to be amused, and when Grindelwald slipped up by saying the hostless Obscurus was useless, Newt expressed disgust at what Graves could possibly use it for. Ultimately, this interaction caused Newt to realise that Graves was Grindelwald and that he intended to use him and his friends (Tina, Jacob, and Queenie) as scapegoats for the Obscurus attacks, becoming determined to stop him before it got too far and subsequently engaging in a duel with Grindelwald upon intervening in Grindelwald's plan to acquire Credence Barebone. Newt did his best to hold off Grindelwald even as Grindelwald dropped all pretences and viciously attacked him with lightning spells in a fit of rage and eventually managed to capture Grindelwald by use of Swooping Evil and revealed his true identity to MACUSA. Before being carried off, Grindelwald turned to Newt, who glared defiantly back at him, and said mysteriously "Will we die, just a little?", possibly as a message for Dumbledore due to his knowing Newt's closeness to Dumbledore.

Newt did not initially want to oppose Grindelwald, as he did not take sides. Grindelwald encountered Newt once more in Paris, during which Grindelwald's only exchange was asking Newt whether Dumbledore would mourn for him. Newt, however, did survive the battle but Grindelwald's murder of Leta left Newt with a strong hatred for him and he chose to side against him during the global wizarding war at last. His act of giving Dumbledore the blood pact would subsequently aid greatly in the defeat of Grindelwald.

Grindelwald's hatred of Newt appeared to come, in part, from his jealousy of Dumbledore's care and admiration of the gifted young man. The Dark Wizard's mocking of Dumbledore's affection for him in the Lestrange Mausoleum is a hint at this, indicating the idea of Dumbledore having someone else other than Grindelwald to love infuriated him. Although the two former lovers now operated on two completely different ideologies, Grindelwald still felt that Dumbledore's attention should be on himself alone.

Leta Lestrange
Leta Lestrange, Newt's childhood best friend
Due to both of them being outcasts and both of them loving magical creatures, Newt quickly befriended Leta and later fell in love with her, to the extent that he took the blame when Leta's experiments endangered a student and he was expelled. Although this left Newt bitter, he still loved Leta, keeping a picture of her in his suitcase, but was clearly resentful of how Leta never tried to contact him again, to the point of briefly lashing out at Queenie for reading his mind. This bitterness only increased when Leta and Theseus became engaged and he refused to interact with both of them at once. Newt himself found Leta's efforts to re-establish their close relationship as irritating and while he was not openly hostile, he would made it clear that he had no inclination to follow her firmly and almost coldly. However, it cannot be denied that Newt still loved her deep down despite his growing feelings for Tina, as he still agreed to be the best man at the wedding and defended her from her self-hatred when she revealed her part in Corvus's death, looking solemn when she stated that he had "never met a monster he couldn't love", referring to herself. Her sacrifice devastated Newt and he was inspired to join the global wizarding war in her honour.

Etymology
Newton is derived from the Old English place name meaning "new town" and was originally a surname. The most eminent historical figure with this surname is Sir Isaac Newton, who, while known largely for his contributions to the fields of mathematics and physics, also wrote many works on alchemy. Some of his writings suggest he was attempting to create a Philosopher's Stone, inspired by the real Nicolas Flamel.
Artemis (Ἄρτεμις) was a goddess in Greek mythology, the daughter of Zeus and Leto, and the twin sister of Apollo. She is the goddess of the moon, hunting, the wilderness, and the gift of taming wild animals. In myth, Artemis spends most of her time hunting, which she has in common with Newt, although he seeks wild animals for conservation rather than sport.
Fido is of Latin origin, meaning "I trust" or "faithful". The name Fido is most commonly associated with being a common name for pet dogs in many countries.
Scamander is very similar to the word salamander, which is a type of real-world amphibian. In the wizarding world, salamanders are small lizards which feed on flames. Newts are also a type of salamander.
Scamander (Σκάμανδρος) is a river god in Greek mythology. The Scamander River (now known as the Karamenderes) flows over where the Trojan War was fought, according to Homer's Iliad.
Each of his four names are most likely referencing animals, due to his love for them.
