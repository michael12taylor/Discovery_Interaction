<html><p>Care of Magical Creatures: Hagrid was also extremely knowledgeable about magical creatures and was highly skilled in looking after, interacting with, and gaining their trust, including dangerous creatures which likely contributes from his experiences in the Forbidden Forest and with his pets. Hagrid's skill and knowledge in handling creatures allowed him to be the Care of Magical Creatures professor even though he was not a fully qualified wizard. Despite his skill and knowledge, many students considered Professor Grubbly-Plank a more qualified teacher for the subject as Hagrid preferred teaching dangerous creatures and could lose his confidence if students tried to disrupt his classes or if he believed they did not like his classes. However, when Hagrid stopped dealing with dangerous creatures too much and began to become more experienced in teaching, his skills proved to be impressive enough to make him a reasonable teacher, as he proved to be able to improve all of the students excluding Slytherin view on him that they all expressed shock that Dolores Umbridge would sack him, although many of them did not choose to continue the subject for N.E.W.Ts due to their past experiences with the dangerous creatures he taught. The dangerous and unpredictable creatures which Hagrid taught included hippogriffs, Blast-Ended Skrewts, and thestrals. Although he believed that tame and less harmful magical creatures did not pose many challenges, Hagrid nevertheless possessed a remarkable amount of knowledge on them as well as monstrous creatures, enough that he was able to effectively continue Grubbly-Plank's lessons on unicorns and he also taught nifflers and flobberworms. Some of the creatures Hagrid looked after included a three headed dog named Fluffy, his pet boarhound Fang, a baby dragon named Norbert, an Acromantula named Aragog, a hippogriff named Buckbeak and his half-brother Grawp, who was a giant. While his teaching methods were questionable, his knowledge helped Harry and his friends on numerous occasions, such as when they got past Fluffy while protecting the Philosopher's Stone, helped Sirius Black escape on Buckbeak, faced a Blast-Ended Skrewt during the Triwizard Tournament, and went to the Ministry of Magic using Thestrals. It should also be noted that his knowledge was such that he was initially the only person apart from Dumbledore who knew how to subdue Fluffy through music as even Severus Snape was unable to get past Fluffy without getting injured, and Quirinus Quirrell, under Voldemort's influence, had to gather the secret from a drunken Hagrid on how to get past Fluffy (which Harry, Ron and Hermione later learnt) especially considering Voldemort and Snape were both already highly powerful and intelligent wizards even in their youths while Quirrell had experience with handling dangerous animals like trolls. Hagrid was skilled enough to gradually earn the respect and loyalty of Grawp, despite the protests of Harry, Ron, Hermione and Firenze, along with Grawp's violent nature. Hagrid's knowledge in dealing with giants and other dangerous magical creatures also made Dumbledore order Hagrid to go and attempt to recruit the giants to fight against Voldemort, which he would have succeeded if not for the Death Eaters' interference and Golgomath's usurpation of the current Gurg, Karkus. Due to his friendship with Aragog, Hagrid was the only person who was able to visit the Acromantula tribe in the Forbidden Forest without being harmed, although this was lost after Aragog's death. Up until he rescued Firenze from the Forbidden Forest Centaur colony, Hagrid was among the very few that they respected and trusted, as he was able to visit them and interact with them cordially and Torvus even noted that Hagrid held enough influence that if Jacob's sibling was a friend of Hagrid, the Centaurs would consider trusting them as well and it was his advice that eventually allowed the student to earn their respect. Grubbly-Plank also noted that Hagrid had the Hogwarts thestrals well trained so that they didn't touch owls even though they were noted to have occasionally gone after birds. This talent also helped him as he was trusted with leading the Magizoologist faction of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force and had efficiently taught the recruits how to handle beasts safely. This can all indicate that Hagrid was a considerably talented person on the subject and this was clearly his strongest subject, possessing more knowledge than even wizards who were more powerful and intelligent, despite lacking the qualifications along with the teaching experience and understanding to fully engage his students.
Potions: Altough not a well known skill of his and his actual level as a potion maker is unknown, Hagrid displayed a remarkable amount of knowledge in the subject. When he asked Jacob's sibling to brew the Fire-Breathing Potion in order to burn the Devil Snare holding Fang in the year 1985, he was able to thoroughly explain to the student all the ingredients needed to brew the potion and was aware that mint had cooling properties that would allow them to consume it without harming themselves.
Superhuman strength: Due to his giant blood, Hagrid possessed great levels of superhuman strength, as shown when Vernon Dursley threatened Hagrid with a gun and Hagrid responded by easily twisting his gun to a knot as if the gun was made of rubber. Hagrid's great strength was also shown when, during the Battle of Hogwarts, he threw Walden Macnair across the Great Hall, a space which can easily fit all the students and staff at Hogwarts. The great strength of Hagrid was also seen whenever he tried to gently pat someone on the back, an act which usually sent the recipient flying. His strength also helped, given the kind of creatures he tended to look after, such as Fluffy, a gigantic three-headed dog, a 10-foot long Blast-Ended Skrewt and Aragog, an Acromantula the size of a small elephant (though seeing as he was Hagrid's friend, he might not have been that bad to look after). Hagrid's strength also proved to be a big advantage when in battle and a powerful blow from Hagrid could badly injure and knock a person unconscious instantly as shown during his battle with some Aurors in 1996. It is also possible that Hagrid was capable of killing a person or animal with powerful blows from his great strength alone, although this was rarely shown as conflicts with enemies were rare for Hagrid. Given Hagrid's absurd ease in handling creatures as large as Acromantulas, three-headed dogs, and his half-brother, Grawp, it can be safe to assume that Hagrid is capable of lifting well over ten-thousand pounds and exerting far more force in combat. Hagrid was also able to control Madame Maxime's horses which were each described as being the size of an elephant and required forceful handling. Hagrid's own massive size would take extreme power just to be able to move, so for him to be able to move as effortlessly as he does, let alone exert his strength as he does must mean that his strength is enhanced by magical means as well as physical. In fact, his strength was such that he was described to have wrestled trolls in the Forbidden Forest as a boy. Hagrid also regularly hauls in the massive Hogwarts Christmas trees simultaneously by himself with no discernible strain, even though each one weighs at least several thousand pounds based on their described height and probable species. Based on this, the full extent of Hagrid's superhuman strength, while never seen explicitly in the series, most certainly makes him a force of nature in his own right.
Superhuman endurance: Hagrid is also known for being able take quite a beating. Due to his outdoorsy line of work, Hagrid is able to exert himself at the peak of his superhuman strength for hours at a time without any known limits to how long he can maintain his stamina. Given that he is capable of keeping up with tutoring and taming his full-giant half-brother, Grawp, and still keep up with his lessons as a Hogwarts Professor, his duties as gamekeeper, maintaining a social life, and his various hobbies of tending to and caring for injured and sick animals in the Forbidden Forest, all while nursing injuries from Grawp, Hagrid certainly has vast levels of superhuman stamina that no other character has matched in the series. Hagrid's bodily tissues are also extremely strong, enhanced due to his giant blood, allowing him to endure beatings from his half-brother that would absolutely kill any ordinary man, regardless of their physical conditioning, although he still experienced visible and rather nasty wounds in the form of bruising and various minor cuts and lacerations throughout his body. Hagrid is also capable of withstanding torture from the likes of Voldemort and his Death Eaters, as evidenced by his maintaining of full consciousness after being captured during the first half of The Battle of Hogwarts.
Magical resistance: Hagrid was resistant to stunning spells because of his giant blood. This also gave Hagrid some protection against curses, including moderate levels of Dark Magic as even the Death Eaters attempts to curse him after Dumbledore's death failed, which gave him an advantage whenever he was involved in a battle.
Poison resistance: Due to Hagrid's work with various magical creatures, many of which are venomous and highly likely to carry disease, it can be assumed that Hagrid's magical resistance afforded him a degree of foreign chemical resistance as well. This can also be assumed in part due to his enormous size in accordance with his giant heritage, as toxicity in the body is relative to one's size and the amount of a foreign substance circulating within. This can also be seen in his difficulty with becoming intoxicated, as it took Quirrell several hours to get Hagrid drunk enough to divulge the information of how to get past Fluffy in the first chamber in 1992. In fact, Hagrid's resistance to alcohol toxicity was so strong that he was able to down an entire bottle of brandy in a single swig without any notable effects on his behaviour or cognitive functioning following the Battle of the Seven Potters in 1997. Such a feat would likely be impossible for anyone of entirely human heritage without the aid of magic.
Arbalist skills: Hagrid was also a skilled crossbowman, a crossbow being his primary means of defence as he was not (officially) allowed to use magic, limiting his experience in duelling.
Physical combat skills: Hagrid was highly proficient at fighting physically. This was displayed in 1996 when Hagrid was attacked by Dolores Umbridge, along with some Aurors, who attempted to sack and arrest him. Hagrid managed to physically defeat all the Aurors effortlessly, which enabled him to escape from Umbridge. It should be noted that his combat was such that even Umbridge's remaining Auror was hesitant to attack Hagrid. Before that, he also rescued Firenze from the other centaurs in the Forbidden Forest after they attempted to kill him for accepting a teaching post in Hogwarts and escaped from the entire Acromantula colony of the Forest to give Aragog a proper burial all without any injuries, which is another testament to Hagrid's combat skills especially as both centaurs and acromantulas were powerful creatures in their own right. Also, in 1998, during the Battle of Hogwarts, Hagrid easily physically defeated Walden Macnair by throwing him across the Great Hall and he survived the battle. As Hagrid rarely used magic, he normally relied on these skills, his great strength, magical and physical endurance and possibly his crossbowman skills to fight in a battle and presumably used his skills to participate in the First and Second Wizarding Wars when he was a member of the Order of the Phoenix. However, he did occasionally use his umbrella-concealed wand when battling, indicating that he was willing to use magic against his opponents alongside his physical battling abilities when the time was right.
Gamekeeping skills: Hagrid began his training as a Hogwarts Gamekeeper in 1943 after his third-year expulsion, possibly under Gamekeeper Ogg; it is known he would have been Ogg's assistant during the 1960s. Hagrid most likely was an efficient and skilled Keeper of Keys and Grounds as there was no mentioned blunder, replacement or substitute (with the exception of Professor Grubbly-Plank on two occasions) throughout his time in this position, and was able to keep up this position alongside his teaching duties as the Care of Magical Creatures professor and his duties for the Order of the Phoenix. These duties included escorting first-year students to Hogwarts, looking after the school keys, preparing for the Hallowe'en and Christmas feasts by preparing the pumpkins and Christmas trees respectively, performing secret and special tasks for the other Hogwarts teachers, and tending to matters which would be difficult for ordinary people and wizards to do such as tending to matters in the Forbidden Forest and looking after the magical creatures around the Hogwarts grounds.
Cooking skills: Living alone in his cabin, Hagrid cooked for himself, though he would have meals in the Great Hall on occasion, such as the various school feasts. He apparently enjoyed his own food, though, being a half-giant, his tastes often clashed with those of his guests. He has been known to serve such foodstuffs to his guests as rock cakes that were too hard for a normal human to chew and a "beef casserole" that was actually made of some taloned creature. Hagrid had a tradition of making a festive treacle fudge for the other staff members at Christmas. Although he was under the impression that they loved it, this wasn't the case. But making it made him so happy that even Professor Snape couldn't bring himself to tell him so. Guests used to his cooking would often politely decline his food, even if it was something of his they had never tried, such as when Harry and Ron turned down some Bath buns he had made in 1994. However, one occasion when his cooking was appreciated was when he cooked some sausages for Harry the first time they met at the Hut-on-the-Rock, which Harry noted was tastier than anything he had eaten before starting Hogwarts.
Tactical thinking and resourcefulness: Hagrid was also good both at being resourceful and thinking tactically when he was in a serious situation. When Aragog was accused of being Slytherin's Monster, Hagrid sent him to the Forbidden Forest to protect him, knowing it was the only safe place for him when Hagrid was expelled on suspicion of opening the Chamber of Secrets, also preventing Hagrid from getting in further trouble for his possesion of the Acromantula. This was again shown before he was temporarily sent to Azkaban when he sent a coded message to Harry and Ron, indirectly telling them to visit Aragog which, while it was almost fatal, allowed them to discover that Hagrid was innocent and determine the location of the Chamber of Secrets, in turn also resulting in Hagrid's release from Azkaban. Another instance is when he smuggled Grawp into the Forbidden Forest without even Umbridge's attention and tactfully brought Harry and Hermione to see him while the Quidditch Final was taking place, ensuring a distraction for the other Hogwarts residents. He also successfully escaped capture on two occasions by fleeing to the same cave Sirius Black and Buckbeak temporarily lived in: first was when Umbridge tried to get him both sacked and arrested due to her prejudice against Hagrid, and the second was when he was almost caught by the Death Eaters for holding a Support Harry Potter party during Voldemort's control over Hogwarts, taking Fang with him for both occasions and Grawp on the second occasion. He was also able to successfully determine that Voldemort was going to wage war on Hogwarts when he heard his message to surrender Harry from his cave, allowing him, Grawp and Fang to return to Hogwarts in time before the Battle of Hogwarts began. His resourcefulness was also demonstrated when he used a moleskin overcoat to carry most of his possessions while travelling, which would be useful in more serious situations if he had to fight in a battle during which he would be unable to carry the majority of his possessions by hand.
Extreme dexterity: Given Hagrid's superhuman size and strength, his dexterity and coordination is well above average considering he is able to handle people and objects that are extremely delicate and fragile, such as Harry when he was just a baby without the slightest bit of difficulty. This level of control over his massive form is to the extent that he is able to weave bindings from stray unicorn tail hairs to secure bandages and splints on injured animals that he finds in the Forbidden Forest. Given that unicorn tail hair is an unusually fine material, Hagrid must have amazingly deft hands to be able to craft it in such a way. His lack of control over his strength is usually in response to his emotions, but it can be assumed that given a moment to concentrate he can control his massive bulk enough to achieve incredible manual feats.
Craftsmanship skills: Due to Hagrid's hands-on style of living, he has developed great skill at building or creating things by hand, such as his clothes, his cabin, and various other items. He is a fine whittler as he crafted a flute from wood that he gave Harry for his first Christmas at Hogwarts that when played made a sound like an owl. He likely also made his commonly worn moleskin overcoat that contains a wide variety of items. Hagrid also likely built the pen that he used to hold the hippogriffs for his first lesson as Professor of Care of Magical Creatures, in autumn of 1993.
Social networking: Due to Hagrid's work in the Order of The Phoenix and his skills at negotiating and making great connections within the magical community, especially with creatures of great pride such as the centaurs, he has great ability to make allies. Dumbledore specially chose Hagrid for this skill to be an envoy to the giants during the summer of 1995. Despite his lack of success due to the Death Eaters' interference and Golgomath's usurpation of the current Gurg, Karkus, Hagrid had great initial strides with the giant colony, showing his impressive social aptitude with magical creatures and beings of all levels of sapience and intellect.
Musical skills: While not a very well known skill of his, Hagrid has shown adequate aptitude for music and would sing while enjoying a drink at events like Bill and Fleur Weasley's wedding and after Aragog's funeral. He also possessed enough skill in the area to create the wooden flute he gave Harry for Christmas in 1991, which when played created music that sounded a lot like the hooting of owls. His aptitude in music also helped him when dealing with certain magical creatures, such as being capable of playing a good enough music to easily make Fluffy fall asleep in order to calm him.
Teaching skills: At first, due to his nervousness, teaching inexperience and desire to teach more dangerous magical creatures due to believing their greater quality, Hagrid was a poor teacher and his teaching ability was disliked by all, with only Harry, Hermione and Ron supporting him. In his first year as a teacher, his teaching ability was also hampered due to his first lesson being disrupted by Draco Malfoy, along with his concern over Buckbeak's safety after he attacked Malfoy for insulting him. However, over time as he gained more experience and started to teach more excitable creatures, he became good enough that although many of them still chose not to continue Care of Magical Creatures in their N.E.W.Ts, all but Slytherin students no longer complained as much about his teaching and openly admitted Hagrid's improvement, defending his teaching skills when he was sacked by Dolores Umbridge, which was to be expected from Umbridge's prejudice towards magical creatures, and expressing shock that it happened. By 2019, Hagrid had clearly improved reasonably, as he was trusted with teaching members of the highly important Statute of Secrecy Task Force who wanted to become Magizoologists and was able to do so succesfully, ranging from teaching the Stamina Charm, despite his less-than-perfect version, and giving them an effective elective regarding magical creatures.
Leadership skills: Although mostly taking orders from Dumbledore and after he was gone the other professors, by 2019, Hagrid had clearly became at least a competent enough leader to be trusted with handling the Magizoologist faction of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force, which clearly shows considerable leadership, being able to lead a rather large amount of magical beast handlers into handling Foundables that included Beasts without attracting the attention of Muggles.
Hagrid's pets
Hagrid with Fang
As early as in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and possibly earlier than that, Hagrid managed to gain possession of numerous magical creatures, many of them dangerous, including Aragog, Fang, Fluffy, Buckbeak, and Norbert (later Norberta). Hagrid's love for animals and his talent for taming and training them won him the post of Care of Magical Creatures Professor at Hogwarts.
In their fourth year, Harry and his classmates were expected to help take care of Hagrid's Blast-Ended Skrewts, one of which (grown to an enormous size) was placed in the hedge maze for the final task of the Triwizard Tournament.

Relationships
Family
Grawp, his half-brother
Rubeus Hagrid was born to Mr Hagrid, a wizard, and the giantess Fridwulfa. Fridwulfa left the family because her son was "too small" for her liking, though Hagrid never seemed to resent her for abandoning him, generally appearing relatively indifferent about his lack of relationship with her. His father, on the other hand, seemed to be a very caring man who was heartbroken when his wife left, and was amused by the fact that, at the age of six, Hagrid was large enough to be able to set him on top of a dresser.[15] Mr Hagrid died when his son was twelve years old, and by the time Hagrid tried to find his mother in 1995, she too had died, although he dismissed the issue on the grounds that he barely remembered her. On the other hand, he was saddened by his father's death, though he was at least glad that his father did not live to see Rubeus expelled from school.

During his travels to the Northern giant colonies that same year, Hagrid found his maternal half-brother: an undersized giant called Grawp. As Grawp's size made it difficult for him to function within his colony, Hagrid brought him back to Hogwarts and hid him within the Forbidden Forest. As Hagrid and Maxime's mission had failed, it is extremely likely that Hagrid also brought Grawp back to prevent his half-brother from being enslaved by Voldemort alongside the other giants. Hagrid's attempts to raise and socialise Grawp initially appeared completely pointless; Grawp's progress in picking up English, or in curbing his violence, which often left Hagrid with a number of painful looking injuries, seemed almost non-existent.

However, over the course of the year, Grawp grew increasingly attached to his older brother and was distressed by Hagrid's disappearance after Dolores Umbridge attempted to have Hagrid arrested in 1996.[17] By Albus Dumbledore's funeral, Grawp was relatively calm and presentable, and he even attempted to comfort Hagrid by patting him (though a bit too hard) on the head and later embracing him.[26] Grawp spent the first part of the Battle of Hogwarts stumbling around, yelling for "Hagger," but eventually jumped into the fray, fighting the giants brought to the battle by Voldemort.[27]

Pets and other creatures
Buckbeak the hippogriff
Hagrid had a good relationship with most of his pets and other magical creatures, most notably Fang, Aragog, and Buckbeak. His relationship with most magical creatures was arguably better then the ones most other wizards had. 

Fang was usually Hagrid's companion most of the time, although he was cowardly. Fang demonstrated some protectiveness towards Hagrid in spite of his cowardly nature such as when he attempted to protect Hagrid when Dolores Umbridge and some Auror's attempted to sack and arrest him. Hagrid, in turn, was also protective of Fang as he was enraged when the Aurors had stunned him, carrying his unconscious body as he fled Hogwarts, and immediately went after Fang when he was afraid during the Battle of Hogwarts. 

Hagrid had a huge friendship with Aragog, whom he had hatched in an egg when he was a student at Hogwarts. Hagrid protected Aragog when he was suspected to be the monster that opened the Chamber of Secrets, throwing Tom Riddle to the ground when he tried to curse him and sending Aragog to live in the Forbidden Forest. Hagrid managed to find Aragog a wife, Mosag, which allowed Aragog to have a family in the forest. Aragog, in turn, was grateful for Hagrid's friendship and protection to the point that he never directly harmed a human out of respect for Hagrid and commanded his family not to harm Hagrid while he was alive. However, this did not stop Aragog from letting his children and descendants attempt to eat Harry and Ron even though they were friends of Hagrid, claiming that he could not deny them fresh meat when it wandered into their midst. Hagrid was devastated when Aragog died and, along with Professor Slughorn, buried him near his Hut. Although Aragog's children and descendants did not hold back in attempting to devour Hagrid after Aragog's death, Hagrid attempted to protect them during the Battle of Hogwarts in honour of his friendship with Aragog, even though the Acromantulas were attacking both Death Eaters and Hogwarts defenders.

Hagrid cared greatly about Buckbeak as he tried hard to prevent his execution by the Ministry of Magic and was overjoyed when he managed to escape with Sirius Black, unaware at the time that Harry and Hermione helped him escape. Hagrid was later reunited with Buckbeak and looked after him when Sirius was killed by Bellatrix Lestrange. Hagrid briefly had a pet dragon named Norbert, whom he had acquired from a disguised Quirinus Quirrell in exchange for knowledge on how to get past Hagrid's three-headed dog Fluffy. However, since dragons were illegal, Hagrid reluctantly allowed Norbert to be sent to Charlie Weasley in Romania and was devastated to let her go. When inquiring about Norbert from Charlie six years later, Hagrid was shocked to learn that Norbert was a female dragon, having mistaken her for a male dragon, and of her being renamed Norberta. Although the full extent of Hagrid's relationship with Fluffy is unknown, Hagrid used Fluffy to guard the entrance of the Underground Chambers where the Philosopher's Stone was being kept and before he accidentally told Quirrell, was the only one apart from Dumbledore who knew how to calm him.

Hagrid also had a cordial relationship with the Forbidden Forest Centaur colony, especially with Bane, Ronan, Magorian and Firenze, and sometimes visited them whenever he went inside the Forest. However, Hagrid had a falling out with the centaurs when he defended Firenze from them as they believed Firenze had betrayed them by accepting the teaching post of Divination at Hogwarts, which was further complicated when he brought Grawp into the Forbidden Forest. During the Battle of Hogwarts, when Hagrid carried Harry, believing he was dead, back to Hogwarts, he was furious when the centaurs did not fight in the first half for Harry, accusing them of cowardice, which convinced them to fight in the second half of the battle. While Hagrid remained on good terms with Firenze, it is unknown whether Hagrid made peace with the other Centaurs after the battle ended.

Albus Dumbledore
Albus Dumbledore, his dear friend
Albus Dumbledore placed great trust in Hagrid, which Hagrid returned with fierce loyalty and unwavering admiration. This loyalty always flared up whenever someone insulted Dumbledore, one time causing Hagrid to give Dudley Dursley a pig's tail, and causing him to choke Igor Karkaroff another time.

While a professor, Dumbledore believed in Hagrid's innocence when he was accused of opening the Chamber of Secrets, and convinced then Headmaster, Armando Dippet, to train Hagrid as the Gamekeeper and allow him to remain at Hogwarts.[16] Hagrid went on to join Dumbledore's Order of the Phoenix as an adult, and he was the one tasked with bringing Harry Potter to Dumbledore after James and Lily Potter were murdered in 1981. 

Dumbledore also trusted him to move the Philosopher's Stone from Gringotts Wizarding Bank to the school and believed Hagrid could offer Harry as much protection as "a bunch" of Ministry Aurors could while shopping in Diagon Alley, in 1996.[26] In 1995, Dumbledore gave Hagrid the difficult task of approaching the giant colonies of the North and dissuading them joining forces with Lord Voldemort, knowing Hagrid was fully capable of the delicate handling required to court the Gurg.[17]

Dumbledore additionally was the only one who supported Hagrid's decision to bring his giant half-brother Grawp with him back to Hogwarts after his mission to recruit the giants failed, allowing Grawp to stay in the Forbidden Forest and later having him sent to the mountains near Hogsmeade. After Albus Dumbledore's death, Hagrid was so devastated to the point that he was inconsolable, despite the best efforts of Olympe Maxime and even his half-brother Grawp.

Harry Potter
Harry Potter, a good friend and student
Harry Potter and Hagrid shared a special relationship. Hagrid was one of the first people (if not the first) Harry could remember showing him genuine kindness and appearing to truly care for him. Hagrid was the one who introduced Harry back into the wizarding world, and he empathised with Harry's situation, as they were both a bit different from wizarding norm and were orphans who had been more or less left to fend for themselves. 

Hagrid was Harry's first true friend, and the two helped each other get through many difficult situations and constantly looked out for one another. Though Harry often took issue with Hagrid's penchant for collecting dangerous pets, as well as the fact Hagrid decided to bring his giant half-brother to Hogwarts,[17] he never failed to support Hagrid in his efforts to protect and care for all of them.   

When Harry learned about Hagrid's half-giant status, he never showed any concern about it, citing his relationship to the Dursleys as an example of how people should not be judged by who they were related to but who they were themselves. Hagrid's kindness and friendship allowed Harry to come to terms with how being an orphan never leaves you, as Harry witnessed Hagrid still mourning his father's death even over fifty years since he passed. This bond between two orphans and Hagrid's reassurance that Harry's parents would be proud of him helped Harry to live with pride in his family. Hagrid was also the one who first told Harry about who his parents were and gave him his first true look at his heritage and family.  

Hagrid was shocked and horrified when Harry came to Voldemort to be sacrificed and yelled at him to run. Hagrid was devastated when he thought Harry was dead and openly sobbed in front of the Death Eaters and rebuked the centaurs for not helping Harry. Hagrid returned Harry to the forest and was very gentle with his body. Hagrid was delighted when he found Harry was alive and was among the first people to congratulate Harry after he defeated Voldemort for the final time. 

Hagrid also met Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley through Harry, and he presumably remained in touch with all three of them well after their time at Hogwarts, as in 2017, Harry reminded his son, Albus, that he had been invited to Hagrid's Hut for tea upon his arrival at Hogwarts.[27] In many ways, Hagrid served as a pillar of strength for Harry, giving him his first look at just how kind people can be, and gave Harry his first taste of kindness, which caught on like wildfire and served to groom Harry into the selfless guardian and warrior he became. Suffice it to say, were it not for Hagrid, Harry could have ended up a profoundly different person.

Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley
Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, his friends and students
Like Harry, both Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley had a close relationship with the half-giant. Though Ron was openly outraged by some of Hagrid's more dangerous pets, particularly Aragog, Hermione was more reserved with her comments and tended to be more proactive than either Ron or Harry when it came to helping Hagrid protect his creatures. She tried desperately to help him appeal Buckbeak's death sentence in 1994,[24] and in her fifth year, she made every effort to ensure sure Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures curriculum would give Dolores Umbridge no excuse to sack him.[17]

When Rita Skeeter revealed that Hagrid was half-giant in the Daily Prophet, both Ron and Hermione stood by him and convinced him that despite all the prejudice he faced, there were still people who loved him and wanted him to stay at the school. Hagrid was on the point of resigning, but with their encouragement, remained at Hogwarts and continued teaching. Ron did show a certain level of concern upon learning of Hagrid's shock, given wizarding history regarding giants; Hermione, on the other hand, noted in an unsurprising tone that she suspected it long ago, seeing as his size fit the profile.[25]

Hagrid came to Hermione's defence during her third year when she was in conflict with the boys (as Ron believed her cat had eaten his rat Scabbers, and Harry was angry that she had gotten his Firebolt confiscated). Hagrid was able to convince Harry and Ron of how poorly they were treating their friend, and eventually, he succeeded in getting the two to reconcile with Hermione.[24] He also encouraged Hermione during her fourth year to ignore the hate mail as he had following Rita Skeeter releasing a nasty article about Hermione in Witch Weekly.
It is possible that Hagrid was close with Ron and Hermione's daughter, Rose Granger-Weasley and their son Hugo Granger-Weasley, as he was planning to have tea with Harry's son, Albus, in 2017.

Madame Olympe Maxime
Olympe Maxime
During the Triwizard Tournament, Hagrid began a romantic relationship with Madame Olympe Maxime, Headmistress of Beauxbatons Academy. They were often seen together, talking and walking around the grounds, and they danced together at the Yule Ball. Though the two had a minor falling-out when Hagrid implied (correctly) that Maxime, like him, was part-giant, they eventually reconciled and travelled together to appeal to the giants of the Northern colonies and dissuade them from joining forces with Voldemort. Maxime was also seen comforting Hagrid during Albus Dumbledore's funeral. The current status of their relationship is unknown, but as Hagrid never got married, it can be assumed that their relationship did not work out.[2]

Tom Riddle/Lord Voldemort
Tom Riddle
Hagrid was two years below Tom Riddle at Hogwarts, and in Hagrid's third year, Riddle opened the Chamber of Secrets, unleashing a Basilisk on Muggle-born students. After the death of Myrtle Warren, Hogwarts was in danger of closing, and to prevent that happening, Riddle framed Hagrid and his pet Acromantula, Aragog, for the crime. Hagrid protected Aragog from Riddle, throwing him to the ground when he tried to curse Aragog, making Hagrid the only person to challenge Riddle while he was a student. Despite this, Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts and had his wand snapped in half by the Ministry of Magic.[16] Believing in Hagrid's innocence, however, Professor Albus Dumbledore convinced Headmaster Armando Dippet to allow Hagrid to stay on at Hogwarts as Gamekeeper.

Tom Riddle never felt remorse for framing Hagrid and ruining his life. As Riddle went on to become Lord Voldemort, Hagrid joined the Order of the Phoenix to fight against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. In 1981, Hagrid was devastated by the murder of his friends James and Lily Potter but was relieved when the Dark Lord disappeared after failing to kill young Harry Potter. Although many thought that Voldemort was dead, Hagrid, agreeing with Dumbledore, believed that he would return one day, as he believed that he did not "have enough human left in him to die". As with most of the wizarding community, he refused to speak Voldemort's name, and generally referred to him as "You-Know-Who." However, when he first explained Voldemort's background to Harry, he reluctantly said Voldemort's name. When Voldemort was searching for the Philosopher's Stone, he took advantage of Hagrid's love and knowledge of magical creatures and through Quirinus Quirrell, gathered the secret of subduing Fluffy through music from a drunken Hagrid, who was remorseful afterwards. Since Voldemort had a certain respect for Hogwart's professors, it is not known if that included Hagrid, who taught Care of Magical Creatures. This is unlikely considering Hagrid's half-giant status.

In 1995, after his resurrection, Voldemort dispatched his Death Eaters to convince the giants to join their side, while Dumbledore had sent Hagrid and Olympe Maxime to do the same. While Hagrid and Maxime were on good terms with the Gurg, Karkus, the Death Eaters supported the giant Golgomath in an uprising that resulted in Golgomath beheading Karkus and taking over the giant colony. The giants then attacked Hagrid and Maxime, who were forced to retreat.

In 1998, Hagrid fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and was captured by the Death Eaters. After Harry sacrificed himself to be killed, Voldemort ordered a grieving Hagrid to carry his friend's "dead" body in his arms, where it would be clearly visible to Harry's supporters. On the way back to the school, Hagrid expressed his fury with the centaurs for staying out of the fight, prompting them to join in soon after.[27] Hagrid was among the first to congratulate Harry after his defeat of Voldemort, showing his disdain for the Dark Lord.

Although Hagrid's expulsion, and much of his later reputation for clumsiness, was originally Tom Riddle's fault, Riddle at least did not attach any special importance to his relationship with Hagrid, and at the Battle of Hogwarts, made no mention of their past. Hagrid, in turn, is never seen to admit to having known Riddle in their youth, and never referred to him except as 'You-Know-Who', or (once) by his preferred alias of Voldemort; indeed, Hagrid is terrified of him in the Battle of the Seven Potters, in spite of having known him. It was never confirmed if he ever knew that his former classmate and the Dark Lord were one and the same; however, since Hagrid said to Harry in 1991 that Voldemort was in Slytherin, it is likely that Hagrid knew.

Weasley family
The Weasley family
Hagrid was good friends with Molly and Arthur Weasley, though it is uncertain as to when they first met, Arthur and Molly not having been in the original Order of the Phoenix. He was most likely assistant or co- gamekeeper when Mr and Mrs Weasley were at school, because of the Ogg timeline discrepancy.[30] Arthur and Molly would have attended nearly two decades later (1960s). He met them again in 1992, at Flourish and Blotts, when Arthur got into a fist fight with Lucius Malfoy. Hagrid broke up the fight and told Arthur that he should have ignored Malfoy, though he clearly sympathised with Arthur on acting the feelings Malfoy went out of his way to inspire. Hagrid was fond of the Weasley's due to their kind nature, immense courage, and their fair-minded views on Muggle-borns and half-humans like himself. 

Twins Fred and George Weasley were friends of Hagrid since their time at Hogwarts. Hagrid seemed to be one of their favourite members of the staff, as he had a sense of humour and was not anywhere near as strict as many of the professors, though he mentioned that he spent "half his life" chasing the twins away from the Forbidden Forest.
Hagrid also knew Charles Weasley quite well; Charlie had been one of the best Care of Magical Creatures students in his time at Hogwarts, and Hagrid described him as being "great with animals." He went on to study dragons in Romania, and Hagrid helped him with the dragons imported to Scotland for the Triwizard Tournament in 1994. Two years earlier, Hagrid had sent his pet dragon, "Norbert" to Charlie in Romania, and Charlie later informed Hagrid that "Norbert" was, in fact, actually "Norberta."

Bill Weasley also attended Hogwarts before working in Egypt with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, and Hagrid encountered him numerous times when he moved back to England. Bill arrived with the Order of the Phoenix at Hogwarts during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, where he was attacked by Fenrir Greyback. Hagrid was invited to Bill's wedding to Fleur Delacour, in which Ginny, the youngest child and only daughter of the Weasley family, was a bridesmaid. Hagrid was quite fond of Ginny throughout her time at Hogwarts, and she was among the students who never even considered turning her back on Hagrid when she found out he was half-giant. Hagrid also knew she had a crush on Harry Potter, and playfully teased Harry about the fact in 1992.

Hagrid did not appear to have much of a relationship with Percy Weasley, though it is unlikely they would have been very close before the Battle of Hogwarts, even if they had had more contact. When Percy was employed by the Ministry of Magic, he did not show any sign of protesting against the Ministry's criticism of Dumbledore's decision to employ Hagrid, as he was a half-giant and Percy disbelieved Dumbledore's claims of Voldemort's return. He also tried to persuade his younger brother Ron to support the Ministry of Magic in favour of Dumbledore, to whom Hagrid was fiercely loyal. However, Percy abandoned the Ministry once it fell to Lord Voldemort, apologised to his family, and fought against the Death Eaters at the Battle of Hogwarts, after which Hagrid would have undoubtedly thought better of him.

James and Lily Potter
James and Lily Potter
Hagrid had been a good friend of Harry Potter's parents, Lily and James, since the time they attended Hogwarts. Hagrid admired them for being amongst the best wizards and witches of their age. Hagrid became a member of the Order of the Phoenix around the same time as James and Lily, and they fought together throughout the First Wizarding War. Hagrid was beside himself when Lily and James were killed in 1981; Albus Dumbledore sent him to rescue their infant child, Harry, from the wreckage of their home in Godric's Hollow, and Hagrid later reintroduced Harry to the wizarding world in 1991.   

Hagrid knew them very well and conveyed the truth about them to their son, who had been lead to believe insulting lies about them and their deaths, restoring and preserving their legacy in their son. Hagrid also kept a leather-bound family album of them which he gave to Harry, which Hagrid came into possession of through unknown circumstances, but might have been entrusted to him by Lily and James to give to their son. Hagrid was known to respect them for their desire to fight for what was right.

Sirius Black
Sirius Black
Though Hagrid described Sirius Black as having been a "trouble-maker" in his youth, Hagrid had clearly been fond of him, as well as his best friend, James Potter, when they were students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After graduating, Sirius, along with James, Lily Evans, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew, joined the Order of the Phoenix around the same time as Hagrid. 

When James and Lily discovered they were Voldemort's next targets, they went into to hiding with the use of the Fidelius Charm; Peter Pettigrew had been made their Secret-Keeper, unbeknownst to anyone else, and betrayed the Potters to Voldemort, framing Sirius for the crime. For many years, everybody, including Hagrid, believed Sirius was the betrayer. The night James and Lily died, Hagrid met Sirius in Godric's Hollow, where Hagrid had been sent to rescue the infant Harry Potter from the wreckage of the Potter's destroyed home, and Sirius lent Hagrid his flying motorbike to deliver Harry to Albus Dumbledore. By 1993, Hagrid was horrified to think that he comforted the "murdering traitor" that very night and deeply resented him for his betrayal, raging that had he knew, he would have attacked Black in retaliation.

Hagrid learned the truth in 1995 once Voldemort returned, a year after Sirius escaped from Azkaban and exposed Pettigrew as having been in hiding as Ron Weasley's pet rat, Scabbers. When Harry and Hermione Granger helped Sirius avoid the fate of receiving the Dementor's Kiss, they also saved Buckbeak, who was poised for execution as ordered by the Ministry of Magic, and in doing so, provided Sirius with transportation to make his escape.[24] Dumbledore re-instated the Order of the Phoenix in 1995, and following Sirius' tragic death during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996, Harry inherited Buckbeak, whom he sent back into Hagrid's care at Hogwarts.[26] Hagrid was saddened by Sirius's death and tried to comfort Harry the best he could, saying that having known Sirius, he was confident that Sirius wanted to go down the way he did, which he truly deemed a valiant way to die.

Hogwarts staff
Remus Lupin
Hagrid would have known Remus Lupin for about as long as he knew the Potters and Sirius Black, though they did not appear to be particularly close until 1993 when Lupin was appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, and they became co-workers. Both Hagrid and Lupin knew what it was like to be within the wizarding community, yet still considered outsiders and face its prejudices, as Lupin was a werewolf and Hagrid was a half-giant.
In 1995, they both joined the re-instated Order of the Phoenix and worked together throughout the Second Wizarding War to protect Harry Potter and bring about the end of Lord Voldemort.

Minerva McGonagall
Hagrid greatly respected Minerva McGonagall, the Transfiguration professor and Head of Gryffindor House. They attended Hogwarts around the same time (Hagrid having been expelled a few years before she started) and they later became members of the Hogwarts staff. As one of the most strict professors at Hogwarts, McGonagall sometimes disapproved of Hagrid's lack of refined behaviour, especially during the Sorting ceremony. However, they were close friends and fellow members of the Order of the Phoenix in both wars.  

In 1995, when Dolores Umbridge brought several Ministry officials to either have Hagrid forcibly removed from the school grounds, arrested, or both, McGonagall immediately came to Hagrid's defence; she took four simultaneous stunners straight to her chest as she rushed to Hagrid's aid, and was incapacitated for some time at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. Hagrid was disgusted and outraged when McGonagall got stunned to the point that he attacked the Ministry officials who injured her, furiously denouncing them as cowards.  

After Albus Dumbledore's death, McGonagall stated that she appreciated Hagrid's opinion very much, as Dumbledore had, and took it into consideration when determining the best time to close the school. McGonagall later became Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where Hagrid was still living by 2017. Also, McGonagall showed no disdain when Hagrid drunkenly kissed her on the cheek at a Hogwarts Christmas celebration. On the contrary, she began to giggle and blushed. McGonagall was touched by Hagrid's defence of wanting to bury their mentor, Albus Dumbledore on Hogwarts's grounds, citing that no other Headmaster had given more to the school, and as such defended his stance on the matter. 

Severus Snape
Hagrid always stoutly defended Severus Snape against Harry's doubts and allegations, on the basis that Albus Dumbledore trusted Snape completely. When Snape killed Dumbledore, Hagrid initially disbelieved the fact and told Harry he must be mistaken but was later furious to learn that Snape had indeed killed the late Headmaster. Hagrid openly opposed Snape when he became the Headmaster of Hogwarts by holding a Support Harry Potter party (unaware Snape was secretly still on their side), an act which almost resulted in his arrest and forced him to go into hiding until the final battle. Before Hagrid fled, Snape put students in detentions with Hagrid, ensuring that they were protected from the harsher and torturous punishments from the Carrows. However, Hagrid eventually learned of Snape's true loyalties during the final confrontation of the Battle of Hogwarts.
