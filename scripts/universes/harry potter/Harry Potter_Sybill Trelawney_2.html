<html><p>Trelawney is portrayed by Emma Thompson in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Order of the Phoenix and Deathly Hallows: Part 2.
Thompson does not appear in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince because she was filming for Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang, despite the fact that Harry Potter co-star Maggie Smith also appears in the film, although as supporting cast, thus not having as many scenes as Thompson, who portrayed the lead character, Nanny McPhee.
Thompson had originally stated that she would not return as Trelawney in the last films.[43] However, she later confirmed that she would reprise her role as Trelawney and had already filmed her scenes.[44]
In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Trelawney appears for only a fleeting moment, respectfully covering one of the fallen battle casualties. She can also be seen from behind battling Death Eaters in the courtyard; look for her curly hair and distinctive green sparkling coat right after Hermione runs between the legs of the troll on the way to the boathouse. You can also hear a Crucio said in her voice.

Both her name and her surname are related to her future telling ability.
J. K. Rowling chose to spell it "Sybill", because she did not feel Trelawney really qualified as a "Sibyl".[45]
Sybill could possibly be derived from the name of a group ancient Roman oracles known as the Sybilline oracles, which is appropriate considering her ability to tell the future and make accurate prophecies.
J. K. Rowling claimed that she picked "Trelawney" because of her love of Cornish surnames, which she had not used in her books before. The age of the name also made it suitable, because of Trelawney's over-reliance on her ancestry when seeking to impress.[1]
The line from The Song of the Western Men used as a famous cry in the south-west of England, where Rowling grew up, was the unofficial Cornish national anthem. It concerns the march to London in 1688 in protest at the incarceration in the Tower of Jonathan Trelawney, Bishop of Bristol.
This could be a reference to Trelawney predicting the death of one of her students every year. It is also interesting to note that Bishop Trelawney also was released and went on to live for another thirty-three years, just as Professor Trelawney's famous death predictions rarely came true.

Her name has been occasionally misspelled or incorrectly provided on official media:
In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Trelawney's first name is misspelled as Sybil.
A collector character wand has been made for Trelawney. However, her name is misspelled as Sybil on the box.[46]
In the Harry Potter Glossary on the Bloomsbury Harry Potter website, her middle name is incorrectly given as "Phyllis."[47]

Her middle name Patricia is said to be Priscila in some of the Brazilian editions.
Professor Trelawney was referenced in the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by a locked door on the seventh floor that states if Harry tries to open it "Do not disturb, crystal gazing".
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, there is a deleted scene that portrays Trelawney dinning in the Great Hall at the opening feast of 1995, where she clumsily eats and makes a mess of her food.
It is somewhat notable that Dolores Umbridge did not attempt to oust Professor Trelawney from Hogwarts when Professor Dumbledore was temporarily removed from his post as Headmaster. It is possible that Umbridge was so overwhelmed with the chaotic status of the school during her brief spell as Headmistress that she simply forgot. Another possibility is that Trelawney was either forcibly removed from the school or helped into hiding by Dumbledore, and Rowling merely did not mention this in the story.
Trelawney bears a resemblance in both appearance and personality to the American Horror Story: Coven character Myrtle Snow, who is also a witch with a natural gift for Divination. Ironically, the show also focuses on a secretive boarding school for witches.
Trelawney is similar in name and characteristics to Sybil Leek, an English witch, astrologer, occult author, antiques dealer, and self-proclaimed psychic. Similarities include:
Nearly identical first names.
Leek's claim to have been descended from the historical Molly Leigh, who was accused of being a witch during the Salem Witch Trials.
Many people thought Leek as "either a bit of a joke or a fraud."
Leek's common disagreements or quarrels with other witches over differences in beliefs.
One of Leek's students admitted that Leek "mixed truths with untruths liberally, causing great harm as she went.

Professor Trelawney, I felt, did not really qualify as a ‘Sibyl’."
