<html><p>Hagrid and Argus Filch regularly found themselves at odds; Filch thought that Hagrid was "an oaf," and even told Mrs Norris, his cat, to keep an eye on the Gateskeeper. Filch did not seem to care or even really acknowledge when Hagrid became a professor, possibly because he was a half-giant, and Hagrid, for his part, called Filch a "sneakin' Squib", when the latter insulted him.

The centaur Firenze
Hagrid had been very familiar with Divination Professor Firenze, long before he began working at Hogwarts, and when the centaur's herd turned on him for entering into "the servitude of a human" by accepting the position at Hogwarts as a favour to Headmaster Dumbledore, it was Hagrid who saved him. Of all the centaurs Firenze seemed to be the most active in working against Lord Voldemort and was not above allowing Harry Potter to ride on his back in the process of saving Harry's life — both of which elicited great respect and gratitude from both Harry and Hagrid.

Hagrid also seemed to be on good terms with Horace Slughorn, the Potions master in 1996. It is possible that Slughorn was one of Hagrid's teachers at Hogwarts, but they later became co-workers. Slughorn attended Aragog's funeral and comforted Hagrid, and while this was mostly because he wanted to extract some of Aragog's valuable venom, Hagrid was touched nonetheless, and the two enjoyed a drunken salute to the late Acromantula.

Hagrid initially held Quirinus Quirrell in high regard, considering him a very talented and clever wizard, and initially seemed to have a good relationship with him, especially when he introduced Quirrell to Harry in the Leaky Cauldron. However, due to his loyalty to Voldemort, a disguised Quirrell later took advantage of Hagrid's love for magical creatures and manipulated a drunken Hagrid into revealing the secret of getting past Fluffy in exchange for a dragon egg. Hagrid was later horrified and guilt-ridden when he learnt of Quirrell's true nature after his death, calling him an "evil git" and blaming himself for Harry's injuries during his encounter with Quirrell and Voldemort. 

Hagrid had a mixed relationship with Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank as while she worked as a substitute for Hagrid in Care for Magical Creatures and his gamekeeping duties when Hagrid was absent or had a mission to do, he slightly envied her teaching skills, which made other students (including Harry, Ron and Hermione) consider her a superior teacher to him for Care of Magical Creatures. This also made him accept Harry, Ron and Hermione's untrue claims of Grubby-Plank being a "terrible teacher" when they attempted to reassure him that they still cared for him despite not taking the subject for their sixth year. Grubbly-Plank on the other hand seemed to respect Hagrid for his skills and abilities despite the students considering her a better teacher than him, as she complimented Hagrid's training of the school's Thestrals and also kept silent about his mission to recruit the giants when Harry inquired her about his whereabouts, understanding the importance of his classified mission. 

Hagrid disliked Gilderoy Lockhart, as did the other teachers, due to him being an annoyingly obnoxious and an incompetent teacher. Hagrid did not read any of Lockhart's books, rejected his ideas of Harry trying to hog the spotlight, and openly criticised him, something that he would normally not do to a teacher.

Dolores Umbridge
The professor with whom Hagrid had the most difficult and antagonistic relationship was, by far, Dolores Umbridge, who was a pure-blood supremacist with a particular dislike for what she called "half-breeds." Throughout the 1995–1996 school year, she made Hagrid's life miserable with her disruptive evaluations of his teaching (part of her role as Hogwarts High Inquisitor, during which she was unabashedly condescending and critical.) 

When a student released two nifflers in her office, following Headmaster Dumbledore's departure from the school, she blamed Hagrid, although he had a rock solid alibi. She later brought Ministry officials to Hagrid's Hut in the middle of the night, either to arrest or forcibly remove him from the premises, though Hagrid was able to resist with the help of Minerva McGonagall and go on the run. 

Hagrid was disgusted by Umbridge's and the officials attack on McGonagall, attacking the Ministry officials in retaliation, although he refrained from attacking Umbridge in order to escape from Hogwarts. Following the Skirmish in the Forbidden Forest, Umbridge was eventually suspended from Hogwarts in 1996 and Hagrid was reinstated as a teacher. She was also imprisoned in Azkaban two years later for her crimes against Muggle-Borns because of her actions as Head of the Muggle-Born Registration Commission.

Hogwarts students
Apart from Harry, Ron and Hermione and the other Weasley children (excluding Percy), Hagrid seemed to have a good relationship with Lee Jordan who was a friend of Fred and George Weasley as he once shook Hagrid's hand, along with Fred and George, when he returned after his mission to find the giants. Apart from them, the other students had a mixed relationship with Hagrid which was especially evident while he taught Care of Magical Creatures. 

Although many of the students had a relatively civil relationship with Hagrid outside his teaching, most of them considered Professor Grubbly-Plank a more qualified teacher for the subject since Hagrid sometimes lost his confidence and preferred teaching dangerous creatures.[25] The Gryffindor students expressed the most enthusiasm when he assumed the post but after Draco Malfoy caused Buckbeak to attack him by insulting him and when Hagrid preferred teaching monstrous creatures over creatures which were tame, their enthusiasm on the subject reduced.[24] Despite this, Hagrid arguably had the best relationship with the Gryffindor students as he was once a Gryffindor himself and was regularly seen supporting Gryffindor during Quiddich matches alongside the other Gryffindor students. Luna Lovegood believed that Hagrid was a poor teacher and said that Ravenclaw students considered him a joke.[17] It is unknown what relationship Hagrid had with the Hufflepuff students, although it is possible their relationship was also mixed like the other students. However, while the other students mostly disapproved his teaching methods, Hagrid had an antagonistic relationship with the Slytherin students as they, encouraged by Draco Malfoy, were also prejudiced against Hagrid due to his status as a half-giant,[17] and Draco's attack by Buckbeak, without caring that Draco did not listen to Hagrid in the first place.[24]

However, despite Hagrid's mixed relationship with them, most of the students with the exception of Slytherin opposed Dolores Umbridge alongside Hagrid and disapproved of Umbridge's harsh and critical treatment of Hagrid due to her prejudice against part-humans. They also believed that Hagrid had improved in his teaching by the time he was temporarily sacked by Umbridge although many of them did not take the subject for N.E.W.Ts due to their past experiences with the dangerous creatures he taught. They were also extremely angry when Hagrid was attacked by Umbridge, again excluding the Slytherin students. Hagrid also opposed the Death Eater's control of Hogwarts alongside many of the students, including holding a Support Harry Potter Party in his Hut, and also fought alongside them against Voldemort and the Death Eater's during the Battle of Hogwarts.

Dursley family
Vernon, Petunia, and Dudley Dursley
Hagrid was sent by Albus Dumbledore to inform Harry Potter of his true identity on Harry's eleventh birthday in 1991 after it was revealed that Hogwarts' letters to him were getting blocked by his aunt and uncle, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, both Muggles who hated and feared magic. 

Eventually, Hagrid found Harry and his family in an old shack out at sea (Vernon Dursley had become paranoid with the amount of Hogwarts letters arriving at their home, so he had temporarily vacated their home in the hopes that they would throw off any wizards possibly following them.) After giving Harry a birthday cake, he introduced himself to Harry, believing him to know everything about the wizarding world (from the letter left by Albus Dumbledore.) Upon learning that Harry knew nothing, Hagrid became furious at the Dursleys for not telling him anything. 

When Hagrid proceeded to tell Harry that he was a wizard, Vernon became angry and admitted that they had known for years and had been trying to "stomp it out of him", including admitting that they lied to Harry in telling him that his parents had really been killed in a car crash. This further enraged Hagrid, but Vernon continued to try and keep Harry from going to Hogwarts, going so far as to call Albus Dumbledore a "crackpot old fool". This, however, sent Hagrid over the edge; he lost his temper and used his pink umbrella to give Dudley Dursley a pig's tail. This terrified Vernon and Petunia enough to let Hagrid take Harry. Eventually, they would remove the pig tail, but the encounter added a newfound fear of magic to the Dursleys' hatred of it. The incident scared Dudley so much that he instinctively grabbed his bottom when meeting the Weasleys, despite them being friendly wizards.

Malfoy family
Lucius and Draco Malfoy, his enemies
Hagrid was disgusted by the Malfoy family's pure blood supremacist values, their open ill-treatment of Muggle-borns and "blood traitors," their allegiance to Lord Voldemort and their disrespect towards Albus Dumbledore; even going so far as to accuse them of 'bad blood', rather against the principles espoused by Dumbledore. In turn, the Malfoys disliked Hagrid, regularly mocking him and doing nearly everything in their collective power to get him sacked from his post at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

In 1992, Hagrid broke up a fight between Arthur Weasley and Lucius Malfoy in Flourish and Blotts, though Hagrid was more sympathetic to Arthur. During the 1992–1993 school year, Lucius was indirectly responsible for reopening of the Chamber of Secrets, as he had used the earlier scuffle with Arthur Weasley to slip Tom Riddle's diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron full of books. Hagrid was blamed for the attacks, just as he had been fifty years earlier when he was framed by Tom Riddle for the Chamber's first opening. Hagrid was arrested as a precautionary measure by Cornelius Fudge, where Hagrid reacted angrily to Lucius' unnecessary presence and ordered him out. Lucius mocked Hagrid by wondering how his small hut could be considered a "house" and claimed he was only there to inform Dumbledore that he and the other governors had voted on his suspension. Hagrid saw through Lucius and accused him of threatening the other governors, which later proved to have been exactly the case.

Hagrid did not get along any better with Lucius' son Draco. Even before meeting Hagrid for the first time, Draco slandered him when talking to Harry Potter for the first time, describing him as "...a sort of savage - lives in a hut in the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed." Hagrid first met Draco in 1991 when he was sorted into Slytherin. During that year, Draco was put in detention with Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Neville Longbottom. Hagrid called Draco an "idiot" when he scared Neville, and in 1992, was outraged when he heard Draco called Hermione a Mudblood. Draco was in Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures class in 1993 and ignored Hagrid's advice on how to handle Hagrid's hippogriff Buckbeak. Draco insulted Buckbeak, causing the hippogriff to lash out and cut Draco's arm. Hagrid took Draco to the Hospital Wing, but Draco swore revenge, and deliberately exaggerated his injury to get Hagrid into trouble. Lucius was furious when he found out and took legal action against Hagrid and Buckbeak. Hagrid tried hard to defend Buckbeak, but the court ruled in favour of Lucius, largely due to his influence at the Ministry, and Buckbeak was sentenced to death, but later freed by Harry and Hermione. 

In Draco's fourth year, he openly disobeyed Hagrid by saying that he would not be coming down to look after the blast-ended skrewts, saying that he spent too much time with them during regular class. Hagrid, hearing about the previous punishment 'Moody' gave Draco, threatened to turn him into a ferret. Later that year, Draco happily provided Rita Skeeter with skewed details about the events of the previous year and delighted when Hagrid temporarily went into hiding following Skeeter's publication of the article revealing that Hagrid was half-giant. In his fifth year, Draco spoke negatively regarding Hagrid during Dolores Umbridge's inspection of a Care of Magical Creatures class conducted by Professor Grubbly-Plank, likely hoping that Hagrid would be placed on probation when and if he returned to Hogwarts, an outcome that did indeed come to pass.

Given that Draco's wife Astoria helped to raise their son to be a kinder man than Draco was in his youth, it can be assumed that Scorpius Malfoy had a better relationship with Hagrid than his father did. This is also likely due to Scorpius being best friends with Albus Potter who was already a good friend of Hagrid's before his first year.

Order of the Phoenix members
The original Order of the Phoenix
Hagrid was friendly with most members of the Order of the Phoenix. Some of them were Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, the Weasley family, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, James and Lily Potter, Severus Snape, and Minerva McGonagall.

Hagrid also knew and greatly admired Alastor Moody, and Moody's protege, Nymphadora Tonks. They fought together in several battles, including the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and the Battle of the Seven Potters, where Hagrid was devastated by Moody's death. Tonks later married Remus Lupin, and their son, Teddy, would attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry after both his parents were killed at the Battle of Hogwarts.

Hagrid was also familiar with Dedalus Diggle, whom he introduced to Harry Potter at the Leaky Cauldron in 1991.

Death Eaters and enemies
Voldemort and his Death Eaters in the Forbidden Forest
As Hagrid was a member of the Order of the Phoenix, he disliked the Death Eaters and tried to thwart their plans most of the time. The Death Eaters whom Hagrid knew the most were Severus Snape, Lucius Malfoy and his son Draco, clashing with Lucius before he was put in Azkaban, and had clashes with Draco while he taught Care of Magical Creatures.

Snape, on the other hand, defected from Voldemort, and Hagrid defended him whenever Harry, Ron and Hermione criticised him, except when he temporarily believed that Snape had betrayed Dumbledore at the Astronomy Tower.

Apart from the Malfoys, Hagrid also had an antagonistic relationship with Walden Macnair, who was a polar opposite to Hagrid's love and admiration for magical creatures. They first clashed when Buckbeak was going to be executed, with Macnair being Buckbeak's intended executioner, then for a second time when Macnair persuaded the giants to join Voldemort and as a result foiled Hagrid and Olympe Maxime's own attempt to convince the giants to join Dumbledore, and a third time when Hagrid threw him across the Great Hall during the Battle of Hogwarts, knocking him unconscious. Hagrid also knew Igor Karkaroff, as he once choked Karkaroff against a tree and told him to apologise to Dumbledore for accusing him of complicity in an attack on Viktor Krum. Thorfinn Rowle also tried to attack Hagrid following the Battle at Astronomy Tower and set his hut on fire. He later angrily silenced Hagrid when the latter tried to discourage Harry from sacrificing himself.

Etymology
Rubeus in Latin means "red".[31] The name suited Hagrid, as red could be for passion or emotion, "an earthy, warm and physical man, lord of the forest".[32]

Hagrid is the archaic past participle of the verb "hagride",[33] which means "harass or torment with dread or nightmares", and its etymology in turn is "hag" and "ride".[34] A hag is a nightmare spirit in English folklore. According to folklore, the Hag sat on a sleeper's chest and sent nightmares to him or her. When the subject awoke, he or she would be unable to breathe or even move for a short period of time. This state is now called sleep paralysis, but in the old belief the subject had been "hagridden".[35]

Hagrid also may mean "hung over," as from alcohol.[citation needed]

Behind the scenes
Hagrid as illustrated by Mary GrandPré in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
Hagrid as he appears in Harry Potter: Wizards Unite
Hagrid was the first person to tell Harry that he resembled his father, but had his mother's eyes. He was also Harry's first friend.
It is unknown why no one calls Hagrid 'Rubeus', which is his first name, although when Hagrid meets Harry for the first time he tells him to call him Hagrid as that's what everyone calls him. This probably means that Hagrid tells people to call him by this name. The only individuals known to call Hagrid by his first name were Garrick Ollivander and Tom Riddle, who have both known him since he was a child.
Given Hagrid's interest in unusual pets, it is possible that his activities may have caught the eye of the Illegal Pets Detection service at some point.
Hagrid was not charged for raising Aragog under the Ban on Experimental Breeding because it was enacted in 1965, 22 years later.
Hagrid quoted "fool Gorgon" when he was about to sent a letter to Dumbledore regarding Harry at the first time he met him.[36] Either Hagrid quoted that line as a mere cursing, or he knew that Gorgons (women-like creatures from Greek Mythology with living snakes as hair) existed in the magical world.
There are two common interpretations of Hagrid's statement to Harry about failing to turn Dudley into a pig on their first meeting- the first is that he genuinely tried to do so but failed due to the spell's complexity, or Dudley's general pig-like nature as he stated. The other is that he intended to give Dudley a tail and was only joking about attempting a full transformation.
Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid
Hagrid is portrayed by Scottish actor Robbie Coltrane in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Part 2 and so is one of the 14 characters to appear in all 8 film adaptations.
Robbie Coltrane was J. K. Rowling's first and only choice for the role of Rubeus Hagrid. She did not, however, create the character with Robbie Coltrane in mind. He was instead, according to Coltrane, "based on a Hell's Angel she knew in the West Country. ...he was just huge and terrifying. And then he would sit down and talk about his garden and how his petunias had been very bad that year."[37] This is the reason why Coltrane is the only known actor to not speak in their native accent, instead speaking in a West Country accent, which is the only English accent noted for rolling of the 'r' sound, and often silencing 'h' sounds, which also became a stereotypical accent of pirates, because Robert Newton, who played the main character on Treasure Island, is actually from Devon in southwestern England.[38]
As well as being Rowling's first choice for the role of Hagrid, Coltrane was also the first person cast in the movie. Interestingly, Coltrane is one of the few actors to play a character older than themselves (Hagrid is in his 60s throughout the series, whilst Coltrane was 51 when he first played Hagrid and 61 the last time he did.)
American actor Robin Williams wanted the role of Hagrid and called director Chris Columbus as well as casting director Janet Hirshenson if he could get the part. However, the "strictly British and Irish cast" rule imposed by J.K. Rowling prevented him from getting the role, and Columbus with Hirshenson had to reject him out of respect for Rowling's wishes.[39]
Robbie Coltrane returned to the part of Hagrid in 2014 and shot 3 different scenes for the official Wizarding World of Harry Potter website on which Hagrid welcomes the viewer in the Diagon Alley expansion.

Robbie Coltrane returned to the part of Hagrid in 2014 and shot 3 different scenes for the official Wizarding World of Harry Potter website on which Hagrid welcomes the viewer in the Diagon Alley expansion.
Robbie Coltrane was usually filmed from a low camera angle to make him appear larger
Since Robbie Coltrane is not really 8-feet 6-inches tall, he was usually filmed from a low camera angle to make him look bigger (usually Harry's angle) or the other actors are filmed from a high camera angle.[40]
Hagrid appears smaller in the films than in the novels, as the filmmakers describe him to be 8 feet 6 inches tall (as opposed to being 11 feet six inches in the books).
Curiously, it says on Hagrid's Ministry card that he is 11.5 feet tall and weighs 289 pounds. However, this would mean that he is dangerously underweight, as his Body Mass Index (BMI) is only 10.6. The only other known character to be below the range is Porpentina Goldstein with a BMI of 17.8. The fact that Hagrid should be facing life-threatening symptoms from being all skin and bones is self-defeating: he is frequently described as huge and bulky in the books, and he is portrayed in the films by an obese actor (he weighed 280 pounds and was six feet tall).[5][41][42] For Hagrid's weight to match his superhuman stature, he would like have to weigh in at over 1,000 pounds, as when you double an object's volume, you actually quadruple its weight to maintain structural integrity relative to the Earth's gravitational pull on its mass.

Martin Bayfield played Hagrid as a teenager during the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and was dubbed by Robbie Coltrane. Bayfield also often served as the role of Hagrid's body double, wearing a prosthetic Hagrid suit, in scenes such as the final scene of the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in which Hagrid waved goodbye to Harry.[43]
Mark Theodore, the actor portraying both the Sorting Hat and Hagrid in the Year 2 and Year 3 casts of the West End production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, again portrayed Rubeus Hagrid, voicing him when the cast of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child read aloud Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 5 (Diagon Alley) together, organised by Bloomsbury Publishing.[44]
In the extended version of 'JK Rowling and Daniel Radcliffe - A conversation',[citation needed] it is revealed that Rubeus is pronounced Roo-Bay-Us. It is unknown why Rowling did not ask for this to be the same in the films, somewhat like Voldemort, which in the books is pronounced with a silent T, except in the British Audible Renditions and American Audible Renditions of the last 3 books.
When Harry mentions Hagrid at the conclusion of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the year is 2017, and Hagrid is one year off turning 90 years old.
Hagrid's bad spelling: "Happee Birthdae Harry"
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone:
Hagrid seems to have poor spelling, as seen when he shows Harry his birthday cake. In addition to this, when Hagrid tells Harry about how his parents were killed, Harry asked You-Know-Who's name. Hagrid responded he didn't want to say his name and when Harry suggested to write it down, Hagrid said he couldn't spell "Voldemort".
He doesn't have spelling problems in the books, as the notes he wrote to Harry were with perfect spelling.
Interestingly, in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery he says he "can't spell fer the life o' me".[45]
When Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached Hagrid to ask him about the Philosopher's Stone, Hagrid is playing the Harry Potter theme tune on his flute.

Throughout the series, it is implied that Hagrid had been the Hogwarts gatekeeper since he was expelled from school in 1943. But at one point in Goblet of Fire, Molly Weasley, who attended Hogwarts between 1961 and 1968, reminisces about Hagrid's predecessor, Ogg, in contradiction to this implication. However, it is stated by Tom Riddle in Chamber of Secrets that Dumbledore persuaded Headmaster Dippet to keep Hagrid on as part of the staff and have him trained for the position, meaning he started out as Ogg's assistant.

Hagrid in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4
J. K. Rowling states on her website that Hagrid is allergic to cats, as well as being hinted at in the first book, which could explain why he dislikes Mrs Norris so much.
Fans of the series raised an immediate outcry upon learning that Hagrid never married.[citation needed] J.K. Rowling responded to the criticism by simply saying, "At least I didn't kill him."[citation needed]
His name (and Dumbledore's) come from a passage in chapter 20 of the Mayor of Casterbridge by Thomas Hardy. "Hag-rids" (as it is in the Mayor of Casterbridge) referred to indigestion.
In the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, it was rumoured that Hagrid had an evil twin brother named Dirgah.
In the credits of the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and in the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, Hagrid is listed as "Hagrid the Giant", despite being a half-giant, technically-speaking.
Hagrid's LEGO mini-figure incarnations consist almost entirely of pieces exclusive only to Hagrid, specifically the body and beard pieces. His head in and of itself is not an exclusive piece, but his face pattern is.
Hagrid is a playable character in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4. In the game, he can fly on a broomstick in the game in spite of the fact that he claims in the books to be too large to ride broomsticks.[46]
In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, Hagrid is the first playable character, at the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley. As Hagrid was expelled, he only has one spell on his Spell-Wheel, which is Wingardium Leviosa. However, after the player makes it to Hogwarts, he obtains his crossbow. Hagrid is unlocked in "The Forbidden Forest" level, by using Reducto on a silver chest in the third area.
