<html><p>Fred and George hated Dolores Umbridge, who was appointed by the Ministry of Magic as the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor in 1995. Umbridge was a sadistic woman who enjoyed punishing and torturing students. Almost every resident of Hogwarts at the time hated Umbridge, but she particularly hated Harry Potter and Fred and George. When George and Harry attacked Draco Malfoy, Umbridge kicked them off the team, along with Fred (although their bans were lifted immediately following Umbridge's removal from the school). Fred and George were the ones who opposed Umbridge. They also created a Portable Swamp, in order to anger Umbridge. When she attempted to punish them, Fred and George insulted her in front of the whole school and then fled with their broomsticks. After the war, Umbridge was imprisoned in Azkaban, for her crimes against muggle-borns.

Dumbledore's Army
Dumbledore's Army, his alias
In 1995, George and Fred joined Dumbledore's Army, an organisation founded and led by Harry Potter, in order to oppose Dolores Umbridge and teach Defence Against the Dark Arts to the other students. The twins knew most of them, and they had a good relationship with most members of the army, including Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Ginny Weasley, Lee Jordan and Angelina Johnson.

Some members of the army were also members of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, including Alicia Spinnet and Katie Bell. The girls appeared to be close with George, whom they possibly knew since their first year, as well as his brother, Fred. Both of them were very upset when Umbridge kicked Harry and the twins off the team. George met them again when they fought at the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998 and they possibly survived the war.

Other members of the army were Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood, Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan, Lavender Brown, Parvati and Padma Patil, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Susan Bones, Cho Chang, Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, Terry Boot, Marietta Edgecombe and Zacharias Smith. George was friendly with them, although not very close; however, he disliked Zacharias Smith, who didn't believe that Voldemort had returned, and did not fight at the Battle of Hogwarts, as did Marietta Edgecombe, who betrayed the army to Umbridge. However, the rest of them fought for Dumbledore's Army, and at least one of them, Colin Creevey, was killed by Death Eaters.

The Marauders
James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew
George and his brother Fred regarded the Marauders with a kind of idolatry and they believed that they owed a lot to them, as their invention, the Marauder's Map, helped them to achieve a lot of their aims. Although they owned the map for many years, they did not refer to them as the Marauders, but instead they called them by their nicknames: Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. 

While they were in possession of the map, the twins did not, however, work out that two of the Marauders were two of their friends in the Order of the Phoenix: Remus Lupin and Sirius Black. Neither were they aware that Prongs was in fact Harry's father, James, and that Wormtail was actually Death Eater Peter Pettigrew.

He and Fred were both friends of Sirius Black after they both learnt of his innocence. Sirius was friendly with them, but he argued with the twins (for example: when he told them to wait at home while their father was in danger). Sirius was killed by Bellatrix Lestrange during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996. The twins were saddened by his death, but tried not to remind Harry about it.

They were also friends of Remus Lupin, whom they first met in 1993, when he was Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. They considered him among the best teachers of this lesson they had ever had. Lupin fought with the twins in many battles of the Second War, and was killed in the final battle, along with Fred. Their bodies were put near each other's in the Great Hall.

It is unknown if the twins ever learnt the true identities of the Marauders, although it is possible they did eventually learn the truth after Voldemort's return considering that Sirius mentioned Pettigrew's nickname Wormtail in front of them while explaining Voldemort's intentions to them without them questioning that. It is also unknown if Lupin and Sirius ever learnt that the twins both had the Marauders Map in their possession during their time in Hogwarts.

Order of the Phoenix
The original Order of the Phoenix, his alias
George also became a member of the Order of the Phoenix during the Second Wizarding War. The Order was an organisation led by Albus Dumbledore in order to fight Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. George had a good relationship with most members of the order. Some notable relationships include Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, his other family members (excluding Percy who had fallen out with the other Weasleys, and Ginny who was underage) and some of the Hogwarts professors.

Another member of the Order that they knew was Nymphadora Tonks. Tonks and the twins were close in age, and they were friendly. They fought together in the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts.Tonks was killed during the final battle, too. Her body was put near Fred's, as well as Lupin's, after their death.

The twins also knew Alastor Moody and Kingsley Shacklebolt. They appeared to have a good relationship, although they were not very close. When Moody was killed by Voldemort, everyone was sad. Before the twins learned about it, they were joking with each other. They immediately stopped talking once they heard Moody died, and their expressions immediately switched to sadness. Kingsley survived the war and became Minister for Magic.

Etymology
George is a popular male given name derived from the Greek word γεωργος (georgos), meaning "farmer" or "earthworker". Saint George was a third-century martyr who became a patron saint of England after the Crusades. Six kings of Britain have borne the name George. Other famous bearers include the composer George Frideric Händel, first American president George Washington, two kings of Greece, and explorer George Vancouver. It was also the pen name of English writers George Eliot and George Orwell. J. K. Rowling has stated that she chose the name for liking and and finding it fitting with the "old-fashioned" theme of the other Weasley brothers.

Behind the scenes

George is portrayed by British actor Oliver Phelps in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Part 2 and so is one of the 13 characters to appear in all 8 film adaptations.
There has been some suggestion that George and Fred are named after their maternal uncles, Fabian and Gideon Prewett, who were killed in the First Wizarding War, and who share George and Fred's first initials.
It is possible that he and Fred were the basis for Kaoru and Hikaru Hitachiin, a pair of mischievous, red-haired twins from the shojo manga, "Ouran Highschool Host Club."
Daniel Radcliffe plays George in the "Seven Potters" scene.
George and Fred earned fewer O.W.Ls combined than each of the rest of their brothers separately.
George and Fred were the only sons of Arthur and Molly Weasley who did not become prefects during their education at Hogwarts.
In the novels, J. K. Rowling described the twins as "shorter and stockier" and Percy and Ron as "long and lanky", but in the film, Fred and George were a lot taller and lankier than Percy and Ron.
George Weasley's O.W.L. results have not been specifically stated by name; he had mentioned in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix that he had an inspected Charms lesson, and that he and his brother Fred were going to sell extendable ears before Herbology. Lee Jordan also mentioned that they played Exploding Snap in Defence Against the Dark Arts. Since they only passed three subjects, these are most likely the subjects they passed (although it is also possible that the twins chose different subjects to take beyond OWL level and purposely failed other courses to free up their schedules).
Rowling has said that George and Fred are among her favourite characters.
Unlike Ron, his younger brother, George never got mad at Harry Potter for dating and romancing with George's sister, Ginny. However, George was protective of Ginny.
The Weasley twins were born April Fools' Day - April 1. It's traditional to play a prank on someone on this day, which seems to be a particular hobby of Fred and George's.
In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 it is George who walks in on Harry and Ginny kissing in the kitchen on Harry's birthday, instead of Ron bursting in on them in Ginny's bedroom.
It is interesting to note that the only times Fred or George have been injured were when they were apart. They were split up at the time of Fred's death and when George lost his ear.
Unsurprisingly, losing his ear barely affected George at all, joking only minutes after having it cut off. By the morning he's even using his ear as a place to hold things.
Author's comments
J. K. Rowling described Fred and George as "the risk-takers in the family... who just take a totally different life path and were prepared to risk everything".

 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

 In his later teenage years, Harry Potter was said to be "within an inch" of his father's height, and James Potter was described as being tall. When Fred and George took Polyjuice Potion to take on Harry's appearance during the Battle of the Seven Potters, they shrunk, indicating that they are taller than Harry.

 MSNBC interview with J.K. Rowling

 Fred and George mentioned having a Charms lesson to be inspected by Dolores Umbridge in their seventh year.

 Minerva McGonagall, the Transfiguration professor, told him to continue transfiguring his racoon in 1994, the year after he finished his O.W.L.s.

 George was told off for playing Exploding Snap in Dolores Umbridge's class, year after O.W.L.s.

 The fact that George took an O.W.L. in Transfiguration is known because in 1994, the year after he finished his O.W.L.s, Minerva McGonagall, the Transfiguration professor, told him to continue transfiguring his racoon in class
