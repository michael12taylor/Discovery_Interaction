Loyalty
Madam Rolanda Hooch (b. before 1918)[1] was a witch who worked as the Flying instructor, Quidditch referee, and coach at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[5] She learnt to fly on her own Silver Arrow broomstick sometime before or during the Great War and returned to Hogwarts for a job. While on staff at Hogwarts, Hooch worked under Headmasters Albus Dumbledore, Dolores Umbridge, and Minerva McGonagall.

During her years of employment at Hogwarts, she taught students how to successfully fly broomsticks (such as the famous Harry Potter),[5] and also acted as the official referee for Quidditch games held at Hogwarts.[10] Her profession also included other important duties, such as keeping students safe from harm whilst they trained for Quidditch,[12] and checking the brooms of students to make sure they were not bewitched with dark charms.[13]

Hooch also survived the Second Wizarding War, and returned to her post as Flying Instructor and Quidditch referee after 1998.[14]

Biography
Early life
Rolanda Hooch was born prior to 1918.[1] She learnt to fly on a Silver Arrow broomstick at some point.[15] One night, at some point during the Great War (1914-1918), her broom was singed by a Muggle anti-aircraft device, which she found personally insulting.[16] She declared that the only thing she found more humiliating than that incident was when a student jinxed her many decades later, in 1991.[16]

She attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in her youth, and was a member of her House Quidditch team.[17] However, it is unknown which Hogwarts House she was Sorted into.

The Hogwarts Quidditch pitch where Hooch was selected to referee
Sometime before her student years at Hogwarts, Rolanda was selected by the Department of Magical Games and Sports as the Hogwarts Quidditch referee. After being selected she underwent a series of complicated and rigorous tests, both written and practical.[18]

Career at Hogwarts
Earlier years
Madam Hooch teaching Flying on the Training Grounds
Rolanda's duties at Hogwarts included First Year Flight Instructor,[5] Quidditch referee[10] and coach in charge of all broom-related activities.[4] She was now referred to as "Madam Hooch",[4] and was respected by her students because of her liking for fair-play and clean games. She was given an office located somewhere in the Castle, in which the crate which held the Golden Snitches, Quaffle and Bludgers was kept safe under lock-and-key when not in use.[19] Her lessons teaching the first years how to fly were held on the Training Grounds[20][21][22] at the back of the castle, near the Quidditch pitch and Herbology Greenhouses.[23]

1960s
During the 1966–1967 school year, Madam Hooch refereed the 1967 Hogwarts Quidditch final, which became famous as the highest-scoring match in Hogwarts history. Future Wigtown Wanderers star player Ethan Parkin led his House to a 580-570 victory.

The team had been trailing 420-570 until Parkin led his team in a Power Play to score a goal, and soon after the team Seeker caught the Snitch, leading to the victory. The match became legendary for its high scores and exciting final moments. In 1987, Hooch also recalled that it was a particularly rough game, having to call a dozen fouls in the first few minutes alone.[24]

1980s
During the 1980s, Madam Hooch continued to teach first-year students basic Broomstick handling and Flight skills. She also taught more advanced manoeuvres to later years. During his time at Hogwarts, Andre Egwu, a highly skilled flyer, sometimes helped Hooch supervise classes.[25]

During the 1986–1987 school year, Jacob's sibling became interested in the 1967 final and asked Madam Hooch about it. The student was particularly interested in the match's last play as Ethan Parkin had returned to Hogwarts to watch his daughter, Skye, play in the final that year. Parkin had taken over the training of his former house team and had mentioned the match, but was evasive about the exact nature of the final play that had won it.[24]

1991–1992 school year
In the 1991–1992 school year, first year Gryffindors and Slytherins had their first flying lesson in the Training Grounds on Thursday, 12 September 1991, during the second week of term.[5] She had twenty of the school broomsticks lined up ready on the grass before she arrived, despite the fact that the school brooms vibrated if the rider flew too high and always flew slightly to the left.[5] She probably had a personal acquaintance with a student named Amanda, whom Hooch greeted personally.[6] To begin the class, Hooch ordered the students to stand on the left side of their brooms with their right hand over it. They were told to say, "up!" to summon the brooms to their hands and were then to hover slightly in the air. Unfortunately, a Gryffindor named Neville Longbottom kicked off too early and lost control, resulting in an accident and breaking his wrist. After examining the wound, Madam Hooch took Neville to the infirmary and warned that anyone caught flying without supervision would be expelled "faster than you can say Quidditch."[5]

Despite this, when Draco Malfoy threw Neville's dropped Remembrall high in the air Harry Potter used his broom to retrieve it, showing great natural skill. Fortunately for Potter, due to  Professor McGonagall's intervention, he was spared expulsion and was offered a position as seeker on the Gryffindor Quidditch team.[5]

Madam Hooch announcing the victory of Gryffindor Quidditch team
Not long after Hallowe'en, the first match of the Quidditch season took place: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. Madam Hooch was to referee the game and told both teams to play fairly, though she was obviously speaking more to the Slytherin team.[10] She released the Bludgers first, then the Golden Snitch, and the game began when she threw the Quaffle into the air.[26] During that game, many fouls were committed by the Slytherins, and she awarded several penalties to the Gryffindors, who won when the new Seeker, Harry Potter, caught the Golden Snitch.[10] Hooch, riding her broom, blew the whistle and announced the Gryffindors' victory to the Hogwarts crowd.[27]

Later on in the year, Madam Hooch was relieved of the responsibility of refereeing the Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff match, as Professor Snape insisted on refereeing the game[28] to make sure Harry Potter's Nimbus 2000 was not jinxed again.[29]

1992–1993 school year
Lockhart's book signing that Hooch attended
In August, 1992, Hooch went to Diagon Alley, and rushed to Flourish and Blotts to see Gilderoy Lockhart, who had been hired by Dumbledore to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts that year. She was clearly a fan of him and of his written works.[7]

The next school year, Madam Hooch refereed the Gryffindor versus Slytherin Quidditch match, during which Harry Potter, the Gryffindor Seeker, was attacked by a jinxed Bludger. The mystery was how the Bludger was jinxed, since it had been kept safe and locked in Madam Hooch's office. She was forced to stop the game momentarily for the Gryffindors once they deliberated over the rogue Bludger, but they ultimately decided to continue playing, as otherwise they would have had to forfeit the match.[19]

The Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff match followed later on in the year, but was cancelled by Professor McGonagall shortly after Madam Hooch had released the balls and began the game. The reason for the cancellation was that Hermione Granger and Penelope Clearwater had been found petrified near the library.[30]

Madam Hooch seated next to Snape at the Leaving Feast
Near the end of the year, Madam Hooch and the rest of the staff were called to the staffroom by Professor McGonagall, who had become Acting Headmistress in Professor Dumbledore's absence. McGonagall told the professors that a student had been kidnapped by Salazar Slytherin's monster and taken into the Chamber of Secrets. After revealing this, Madam Hooch became too weak at the knees to stand, collapsed into a chair and asked who had been taken, when she was told that it was Ginevra Weasley, whom Hooch had been giving Flying Lessons.[31] However, she was saved by the end of the year by Harry Potter and Ron Weasley and then the school returned to its normal routines.[32]

1993–1994 school year
Hooch referring a Quidditch match as mass of Dementors interrupt the game
Not long after the beginning of the 1993–1994 school year, Madam Hooch refereed the Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff Quidditch match, which took place in severe weather conditions and poor visibility. But during that match, Dementors, who were supposed to be guarding the school, interfered and made Harry Potter fall off of his broomstick, enabling the Hufflepuff Seeker, Cedric Diggory, to catch the Golden Snitch.[12]

After the attack on the Fat Lady by Sirius Black at Hallowe'en, Professor McGonagall asked Madam Hooch to oversee his Quidditch practices on the pitch for his safety, which she did for McGonagall.[12]

Furthermore, Harry mysteriously received a Firebolt broomstick for Christmas, which McGonagall thought could have come from Sirius Black. In order to ensure that the broom was safe to ride, McGonagall handed it over to Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick, the Charms Master, who would "strip it down" to look for curses, hexes, or jinxes.[13] A few weeks later, once Hooch and Flitwick had ensured the broom's safety, the Firebolt was returned to Harry Potter to use in his Quidditch practices and games.[33]

Hooch falls asleep while overseeing a Gryffindor Quidditch practice
She was quite taken with the broom and rhapsodised over it for some time before Oliver Wood, the Gryffindor Quidditch Captain and Keeper, reminded her that they were there to practise and not listen to her talking about her old Silver Arrow. Though she was supposed to keep an eye on Harry, she then proceeded to fall asleep in the stands while the Gryffindor Quidditch team practised.[15]

The game between the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw was refereed by Madam Hooch. The game was concluded when Harry Potter caught the Golden Snitch, awarding one-hundred and fifty points to his already-winning Gryffindor team.[15]

The final match, for the Quidditch Cup, was between Gryffindor and Slytherin, and Madam Hooch was tasked with overseeing the match as a referee. The final was a violent game, and Madam Hooch commented several times that she has never seen such flagrant fouls committed. Indeed, she was rendered almost apoplectic with fury at the level of cheating demonstrated by the Slytherin team, awarding a grand total of five penalties to the Gryffindors as the match grew progressively dirtier. The match concluded with Harry Potter's capturing of the Golden Snitch, earning the Gryffindor Quidditch team the Quidditch Cup for the first time in roughly seven years.[34]

1994–1995 school year
Hooch teaching first years how to mount a broomstick
The following academic terms were to be dedicated to the revival of the Triwizard Tournament, meaning that the 1994-1995 Quidditch Cup was not to take place.[35] This was also due to the fact that the Hogwarts Quidditch Stadium was to play host to the enchanted Hedge Maze of the Third Task.[36] Because of this, it is assumed that Madam Hooch's only duties that year was to give flying lessons to the first year students, though she may have helped prepare the tasks with the other teachers.

1995–1996 school year
Hooch overseeing a Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin
Madam Hooch's timetable for Quidditch matches was disrupted by Dolores Umbridge, the Hogwarts High Inquisitor, during the 1995–1996 school year, since Umbridge kept giving detentions to students who played the sport.

Regardless, Hooch did referee the match between the Gryffindor Quidditch team and the Slytherin Quidditch team, during which much foul play and dirty moves were used. Near the end of the match, Vincent Crabbe, a Slytherin Beater, hit a Bludger at Harry Potter after he caught sight of the Golden Snitch, knocking him to the ground. Being a Quidditch foul, Madam Hooch immediately scolded Crabbe, and, once finished, turned around to see Harry Potter and George Weasley attacking Draco Malfoy. After using an Impediment Jinx to knock Harry to the ground, she sent the two of them to Minerva McGonagall's office, where they were banned from their Quidditch team by Dolores Umbridge.[37] This ban would eventually be lifted after Umbridge was removed from Hogwarts.[38]

It is possible that Madam Hooch had her flying lessons inspected by Dolores Umbridge that year, and pleased her, as she was not sacked.

1996–1997 school year
In the 1996-1997 school year, Madam Hooch refereed the match between the Gryffindor and Slytherin Quidditch teams, and was ready to release the Snitch, Bludgers and Quaffle before the players were on the pitch. Shortly after starting the game, Slytherin Seeker Harper deliberately collided with Harry, in the hopes of steering him in the wrong direction. As this was a foul (Blurting), the Gryffindor crowd screamed at Hooch to award a penalty to their team, but her back was turned and she did not see the foul. The game concluded with Harry Potter's capture of the Golden Snitch.[39]

Albus Dumbledore's funeral
Near the end of the year, the castle was invaded by Death Eaters, who fought the teachers and students of Hogwarts, as well as the Aurors stationed there.[40] It is unknown whether Madam Hooch took part in the battle. After the battle's conclusion, Albus Dumbledore was found dead[40] in the Middle Courtyard, and everyone around raised their wand as a sign of respect to him.[41] It can be assumed that Hooch attended Dumbledore's funeral being a long term colleage of him.

1997–1998 school year
Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort and the end of the Second Wizarding War
During the 1997–1998 school year, Severus Snape became the Headmaster and Alecto and Amycus Carrow became the Deputy Headmasters. In May of that year, Snape and the Carrows were attacked[42] and the Battle of Hogwarts took place,[43] in which Madam Hooch was probably more than likely to participate in, being a teacher at Hogwarts. She was also most likely there when Harry Potter defeated and killed Voldemort for good, ending the Second Wizarding War. The Hogwarts Quidditch Pitch was burned to the ground in the early stages of the battle, however.

Later life
Madam Hooch survived the war and continued to serve as the Flying Instructor and Quidditch referee at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. During the Calamity, she would help members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force improve their ability to target elusive foes by having them cast spells while she dodges on her broom.

Madam Hooch was still teaching as of 2020,[44] at the age of at least one-hundred and two. In September 2017 she taught Albus Potter and was not impressed with him, as he struggled to make his broom rise.[14]

Physical description
In her elderly years, during the 1990s, Madam Hooch had spiky grey hair which was cut short and had piercing, yellow, hawk-like eyes,[5] usually hidden behind goggles.[26] She usually wore a white button-down collared shirt and black necktie with the Hogwarts crest, under a cloak,[6] but wore more formal black robes with a hat while sitting in the Great Hall.[45]

Personality and traits
Madam Hooch was known and respected by her students because of her belief in good sportsmanship, fairness, and clean games of Quidditch.[10] She sometimes seemed impatient whilst teaching her students flying, as while teaching a group of first years, during the 1991–1992 school year she was continually telling them to "hurry up" and asking "well, what're you waiting for?".[5]

Regardless she was still kind and caring, as evident when Neville Longbottom broke his wrist after injuring himself during a Flying Class, she tended to him after his accident and took him immediately to the Hospital Wing.[5] Another example was when she learnt that Ginevra Weasley had been taken into the Chamber of Secrets. After learning this she had sunk (weak-kneed) into a chair in the staffroom.[31] Hooch was also very strict and was unafraid to use an Impediment Jinx on Harry Potter and George Weasley after the two attacked Draco Malfoy.[37]

Magical abilities and skills
Flying: Madam Hooch had considerable skill and talent in broomstick flight. She learnt how to fly on a Silver Arrow,[15] and flew over the Quidditch stadium at the end of the Gryffindor versus Slytherin match in 1991, announcing the Gryffindors' victory.[27] Her accomplishment and talent in flying allowed to teach Flying class to Hogwarts students as the school's Flying Instructor, which she did highly competently and professionally, teaching students how to safely and successfully fly broomsticks.[5]
Broomology: Hooch was also known to be highly adept in the lore of brooms. This was evident when Minerva McGonagall handed over a Firebolt to her and Filius Flitwick so that they could test it for jinxes, hexes and curses; Flitwick using his charms mastery, and Hooch using her knowledge.[13] Also, while examining Harry's Firebolt before his first flight on it, she commented how the Nimbus series develop a drag after a few years of flying.[15] This implied that she possessed very considerable knowledge of broomsticks.
Defence Against the Dark Arts: Madam Hooch was able to cast an exceptionally powerful Impediment Jinx[37] and was also able to examine a broom for curses and other unfriendly spells.[13] She was also tasked in 1993 by Minerva McGonagall with overseeing Harry Potter's Quidditch training, in order to protect him from the then presumed mass-murderer Sirius Black, which she agreed to do.[12] If she did participate in the Battle of Hogwarts, she was presumably a skilled duellist as well.
Charms: Rolanda was capable of producing a non-corporeal Patronus,[7][8] an incredibly advanced piece of magic and a mark of superior magical ability, given the immense difficulty of casting the charm. She was also capable of teaching her Flying students how to perform the Gripping Charm.[46]
Etymology
Rolanda is a feminine form of Roland, a name of Germanic origin that means "fame-land", "fame of the land", "old and wise", or "judicious, wise". Roland was a paladin of Charlemagne and a principal figure in the Matter of France. The "Roland" was a Franco-German missile system, and the WWI aircraft manufacturer Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft was known for their various "Roland" designs.

Hooch may come from Hoch or Hoog, Germanic words that mean "high" or "tall."

Madam Hooch was played by Zoë Wanamaker in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Madam Hooch did not reappear in any of the following films, as Wanamaker had only signed up for one film.
Like Professor Quirrell, Madam Hooch's first name was never mentioned in the books. Harry Potter Trading Card Game lists it as Rolanda.
Prior to the release of the first film, IMDB listed her first name as Xiomara.
In an episode of the Britcom series My Family, in which Wanamaker plays Susan, one of her sons pulls a trading card from a box of cereal and exclaims "Hey look, Madam Hooch!" Also, in a later episode during Hallowe'en when Susan is dressed as a witch and is trying to encourage her husband to join in, he tells her she "can take your Nimbus 2000 and stick it where the sun doesn't shine."
On an episode of The Paul O'Grady Show Zoë Wanamaker said she was disappointed that she was never asked to return to the Harry Potter saga and would not mind doing so for the last two films.
Zoë Wanamaker was one of three American actors who appeared in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the others being Eleanor Columbus, who played Susan Bones, and Verne Troyer, who played Griphook. It should be noted that though she was born in the States, she is in fact British.
On the first game of the series (GBA version), when Harry casts a spell that hits Hooch, she says that she's never been insulted that way since an anti-aircraft singed her broom during the Great War (1914-1918). This indicates that Hooch was born before 1918, possibly in the 1900s, seeing as she was already capable of broom flight. The fact that she owned a Silver Arrow supports this, seen as the broom was manufactured very early in the twentieth century.
In the PC version of the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Madam Hooch is never seen, although she is mentioned by one of the students in the Clock Tower.
To create Madam Hooch's yellow hawk-like eyes, special contact lenses were used.
Madam Hooch is the only Hogwarts teacher (excluding members of staff who do not teach, such as Madam Pomfrey and Madam Pince) to be referred to as 'Madam' rather than 'Professor'. The exact reasons for this are unknown, although it is possible that it is because she only teaches the first-years, and the majority of her job involves Quidditch matches as opposed to actual teaching. Alternately, she may not be considered a Professor as flying is primarily a physical discipline rather than an academic one.
Though she is commonly only depicted as teaching first years, in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, Hooch is also seen teaching more advanced manoeuvres to later years. If this is taken as cannon, it does contradict the theory of her not having a professorship due to only teaching first years.

J. K. Rowling stated in an interview with PotterCast on 17 December 2007 that "Madam Hooch really did not have any romantic backstory. Well, not my invention, I don't know".[47]

↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) - GBA version, Hooch says her broomstick was singed during the Great War. It should also be noted that, according to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Chapter 13 (Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw), she learnt to fly on a Silver Arrow broomstick, which production started sometime after the Moontrimmer (itself first created in 1901) — cf. Quidditch Through the Ages, Chapter 9 (The Development of the Racing Broom).
