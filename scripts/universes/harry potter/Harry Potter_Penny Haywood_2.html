<html><p>Penny is one of the four characters (along with Merula Snyde, Andre Egwu, and Barnaby Lee) available as romance options for all dating side quests: Celestial Ball, First Date, Valentine's Day, Festival Fun, Valentine's Day Ball, and An Enchanted Kiss. While all romance options gain unique outfits and occasionally other appearance changes, Penny is the only one whose hairstyle changes noticeably in every dating side quest (except An Enchanted Kiss where none have unique outfits). In 2021 she was remodelled with a casual outfit which composed of a shirt with a denim jacket and a skirt.
Penny's Celestial Ball appearance varied prior to release, with concept art showing her dress to be entirely yellow, and leaked model showing her wearing what appears to be a golden laurel wreath.
In her fifth year, Snape's criticism of her handling of Beatrice's situation echoed his remarks towards then-fifth year Harry Potter on the principles of Occlumency, considering them weak for being openly emotional and wallowing in their grief. However, given that Snape's loyalties ultimately lay with the protagonists, this could be seen as having been for their own good; after hearing that, Harry did understand the importance of and eventually succeeded in blocking his connection with Voldemort, and Jacob's sibling was spurred to support Penny and prevent her from a path of self-destruction.
Jacob's sibling may choose Penny to accompany them in their search for the Vault of Ice; if she is chosen. she will use a Strengthening Solution to allow herself to tear open a frozen door.
Starting from her first Valentine's Day model (including all later dating sidequests and her casual wear), Penny's eye colour changes from a dark periwinkle to a noticeably lighter Robin's egg blue.
Penny owned a copy of Advanced Potion-Making that she had scribbled notes all over to the point of needing a fresh copy, much like Severus Snape's copy.
In her Hippogriff Club quiz encounter, the correct answer to "What plant is kelp related to?" is "Seaweed." In real life, kelp is a type of seaweed, and neither are plants; they are algae, a group of organisms that have existed for hundreds of millions of years before land plants appeared.
Penny has appeared in various advertisements of Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery with various levels of canon adherence. Most notably, she is one of the three Hogwarts students to have featured in multiple cinematic trailers (Back to Hogwarts, Valentine's, 3rd Anniversary) along with Barnaby Lee and Emma (a brown-skinned, dark short-haired female version of Jacob's sibling).

 The "Penny for Your Thoughts" side quest triggers in year 3, in which Penny says Scarlett was killed "last year", which can be interpreted as the summer of 1985 or 1986 (between year 1 and year 2, or between year 2 and year 3). However, in "The Hallowe'en Feast" side quest, which can be triggered as early as year 1, Penny mentions her friend has already been killed by a werewolf. However, as in Penny's account in "Penny for Your Thoughts" Penny already had a wand and was capable of doing magic with it at the time of Scarlett's death, it is unlikely it occurred in the summer prior to attending Hogwarts. On the other hand, as "Penny for Your Thoughts" has been removed, it can be considered that Scarlett's death may have been retconned to occur before Penny's time in Hogwarts.
