↑ J K Rowling at the Edinburgh Book Festival, Sunday, August 15, 2004- "[Q:] What form does Dumbledore’s Patronus take? [JKR]: Good question. Can anyone guess? You have had a clue. There was a little whisper there. It is a phoenix, which is very representative of Dumbledore for reasons that I am sure you can guess."

↑ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 20 (Xenophilius Lovegood) - "“Dumbledore’s dead,” he said. “I saw it happen, I saw the body. He’s definitely gone. Anyway, his Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe.”"

According to Writing by J.K. Rowling: "Remus Lupin" at Wizarding World, Remus Lupin became a werewolf shortly before he turned 5 in March 1965 and Dumbledore visited him as Headmaster shortly before his eleventh birthday. This means Dumbledore became Headmaster between March 1965 and March 1971.
