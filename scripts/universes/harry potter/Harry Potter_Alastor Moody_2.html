<html><p>Vance was killed by Death Eaters in 1996, while Podmore was imprisoned in Azkaban for attempting to open the door of the Department of Mysteries. Moody didn't know it and was angry with Podmore, because he had taken his Invisibility Cloak.

Mundungus was paired along with Moody during the Battle of the Seven Potters. When Voldemort attacked them, Mundungus was frightened and disappeared, abandoning Moody, who was killed by Voldemort.

Some of the members of the order were killed during the First Wizarding War. These included Marlene McKinnon, who was killed along with her family, Caradoc Dearborn, who was murdered by Death Eaters and his body was never found, Benjy Fenwick, who was killed and mutilated, Edgar Bones, who was killed along with his family, Dorcas Meadowes, who was murdered by Voldemort himself, Gideon and Fabian Prewett, who were killed by five Death Eaters, and James and Lily Potter, who were killed by Voldemort. However, Alice and Frank Longbottom were tortured into insanity by four Death Eaters; Bellatrix Lestrange, Barty Crouch Jnr and Rodolphus and Rabastan Lestrange. Moody was evidently saddened by their fates and noted that death would have been better and much easier to handle than the lack of sanity with which they would have to live until they die.

Most members of the Order of the Phoenix were devastated after Moody was killed, and many of them were killed, too, by the end of the Second Wizarding War.

Although originally some members of the Order thought Moody was being overly paranoid with his extra security, and simply humoured him passively, during the rising stakes of the Second Wizarding War, especially after Alastor was killed, the other members took after his methods, mainly asking questions that only other members would be aware of; Lupin even acted violently and cautiously when asking Harry such a security question.

Death Eaters and enemies
Igor Karkaroff, an enemy and former Death Eater
During his years as an Auror, Moody captured and defeated many Death Eaters, such as Evan Rosier. According to Sirius Black, Moody was very cruel with the Death Eaters he fought against, but he never killed if he could avoid it.

Moody captured Karkaroff after Voldemort's downfall. He also participated in Karkaroff's trial and told Dumbledore that they should take information from Karkaroff and then send him back to the Dementors. However, Dumbledore refused. Moody and Karkaroff met again in 1994, during the Triwizard Tournament. In fact, he wasn't the real Alastor Moody, but Barty Crouch Jnr, a Death Eater. After Harry Potter was chosen for the Tournament, Karkaroff got very angry, because Hogwarts had two champions. When Barty (disguised as Moody) told him how the Goblet of Fire might have been fooled, Karkaroff told him that he thought like a Dark Wizard. Barty answered that it was his job to capture Dark Wizards and perhaps he remembered, meaning that Moody and Karkaroff knew each other well. It is unknown how the real Moody reacted when he learned that Karkaroff was killed by Death Eaters.

Moody also held a grudge against Barty Crouch Jnr for abducting, imprisoning, and impersonating him, and was furious that Crouch damaged his magical eye by wearing it, causing it to get stuck from time to time. It is possible, though never confirmed, that Moody disapproved of Crouch's teaching style and methods, though in the opinions of the students (and presumably the faculty), they were virtually indistinguishable. 

Peter Pettigrew was another Death Eater who attacked and subdued Moody. Both Peter and Moody fought against the Death Eaters together during the First Wizarding War, though it's unknown what kind of relationship they had. It's also not known how Moody reacted upon learning that Peter was alive and actually a Death Eater.

According to Bill, Alastor earned himself many enemies, mainly the families of the criminals he arrested. Voldemort saw Moody as the most potent threat among the Order of the Phoenix, and during the Battle of the Seven Potters, personally killed him.

Etymology
"Alastor" is Ancient Greek for "he who does not forget", thus (1) "avenger", "persecutor", "tormenter", (2) "one who suffers from divine vengeance". It gives him, therefore, certain similarities to Alecto Carrow, whose name is that of the first of the Furies, or Erinyes, and means "implacable anger". It is similar to "Alastair", which is the Scottish form of Alexander, which means "protector of mankind", and also evolved into "Alistair".
Moody means temperamental or tending to quickly change moods.

Moody is portrayed by Irish actor Brendan Gleeson in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix and Deathly Hallows: Part 1. His son Domhnall Gleeson played Bill Weasley in Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Part 2.
In the films, Moody is portrayed considerably different from his literary counterpart. Differences between his description in the book and his portrayal on film include his magical eye being held in place by an eye patch-like strap and brass ring, having a less mutilated face, including a full nose instead of a piece of it missing.
In the film adaptation, the magical eye replaced Moody's left eye. The illustration in the Goblet of Fire shows Moody's magical eye replaced his right eye and his nose is intact (see drawing under physical description above). The back cover illustration of the Order of the Phoenix also shows it in the right eye socket, while the bridge of his nose looks damaged. There's no written description of which leg and which eye were lost.
In the films he has hair that is blonde but greying rather than hair that is completely grey, and is somewhat overweight. His artificial leg in the films is made of metal rather than wood.
He also speaks with Gleeson's natural Irish accent, although his nationality appears to be Scottish, seeing as his impostor wears a kilt in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire during the Yule Ball. His nationality is never identified in the book, although Moody is a surname common in both Ireland and Scotland, while Alastor (sometimes spelt Alistair) is a Scottish first name.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Moody has a specialised broom and his wand is either concealed in his walking stick or is the stick itself.
Also in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries scene, Alastor Moody can be momentarily glimpsed in the background duelling two Death Eaters wielding not only his staff in his right hand, but what appears to be a wand in his left.(Exact time in reference 1:53-1:57)
The Noble Collection also made a replica of Alastor's wand, as seen in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
Alastor Moody is the only Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts never seen before the start of the academic year, as Barty Crouch Jnr, disguised as Moody, first appears on 1 September, and the real Mad-Eye Moody appears only at the end of the year.
A keychain replica of Moody's magical eye was also released.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, it is Sirius, not Moody, who gives Harry the picture of the original Order of the Phoenix members.
"Constant Vigilance!" is Moody's supposed catchphrase. However, the phrase is never actually uttered by Moody, only by Barty Jnr when impersonating him. In the film adaptions, the phrase is omitted altogether (aside from one use that was edited out).
The scenes of Moody's magical eye being taken and used by Dolores Umbridge, as well as Harry recovering and properly burying it have been omitted from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (footage of this may have been filmed, however, seeing as it is seen on Umbridge's door with no mention of it being used.)
According to his file, Alastor Moody was 6' 2" and weighed 183 lbs. Whether this weight accounted for his prosthetic leg (which, in the films where the file is seen, is made of metal and thus would presumably be significantly heavy) or not is unknown.
He says in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 that Polyjuice Potion "tastes like goblin piss" before the Battle of the Seven Potters.
To this one of the Weasley twins says "Have a lot of experiences with that, do you Mad-Eye?", either referring to their 6th year and well aware that this was not the real Moody or joking that he knew what "goblin piss" tasted like, or both.

It is possible that Moody took part in the capture of the Lestranges and Barty Crouch Jnr following their attack on Frank and Alice Longbottom. During the trial for the former, Moody is conspicuously absent despite being present during both Igor Karkaroff and Ludovic Bagman's trials. It may be during this skirmish that he lost his eye as he had both eyes during the former trials and he is said to have lost it in a battle against Death Eaters. It's possible that his absence during the Lestrange trials was due to suffering an injury to his eye, forcing him to replace it with his magical one.
Moody may have been currently the only wizard to know a Boggart's true form: in fact, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, he was asked by Molly Weasley to check if there was one inside a drawer. Since he used his magical eye, which can see through objects, it is possible the Boggart did not realise his presence and thus did not transform.
On  Pottermore, in the moment "Grimmauld Place", the image of Alastor Moody is incorrectly identified in the page source as "dumbledore.png", though this filename could possibly refer to the fact that Moody is giving Harry a note from Albus Dumbledore in this scene.

Notes and references
 As Moody was noted to have been an Auror already in the First Wizarding War, which ended in 1981, he must have been at least twenty-two years old and had graduated from Hogwarts at age 18. Auror training takes a further three years, as revealed in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 29 (Careers Advice) adding this with the additional year between him killing Evan Rosier in 1980 and the end of the war.

 Moody was born before 1959, and died on the 27th of July in 1997, so he was at least 37 or 38 at his death.
