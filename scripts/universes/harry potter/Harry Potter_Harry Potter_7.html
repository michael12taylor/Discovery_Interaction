<html><p>Resourcefulness: Harry showed resourcefulness in many different situations. In his first year he impersonated the Bloody Baron. Harry did this in order to warn Peeves to stay away from the third floor that night so he wouldn't inconvenience the trio on their quest to save the Philosopher's Stone. In his second year, when encountering Professor McGonagall after hours, he lied and said that he and Ron were on their way to see Hermione in the hospital wing. Also in his second year, he used a basilisk fang to destroy Riddle's Diary. In his fourth year, he managed to escape from Voldemort and all the Death Eaters, taking Cedric Diggory's dead body with him. In his fifth year, while under interrogation from Umbridge, he relayed a coded message to Snape. He did this in an attempt to warn Snape and by extension the Order, that Voldemort had Sirius. In the same year, while surrounded by Death Eaters Harry came up with the plan to smash the shelves in the Hall of Prophecy. This was a distraction so that he and the D.A. could try and escape. During the hunt for Horcruxes, he used the Godric Gryffindor's Sword as a way of retrieving Helga Hufflepuff's cup from the mounds of burning treasure and used a half-blind dragon as a means to escape from Gringotts Wizarding Bank. Harry was also cunning enough that the Sorting Hat heavily considered Sorting him into Slytherin house.
Harry, leader and teacher of Dumbledore's Army
Leadership skills: While Harry never deliberately set out to be a leader to others, he had often taken charge when the situation required it. This began with his impulsive decision to find and warn Hermione about the presence of a troll in the school during the 1991 Hallowe'en feast. It progressed to the point where over thirty students, some of them in their sixth and seventh years — respect him as a teacher in Dumbledore's Army, despite him being younger than they were. Dumbledore later noted that Harry was a superior leader to him. Dumbledore had deliberately sought power in his youth, and subsequently avoided anything more demanding than his role as Hogwarts headmaster — while Harry had leadership thrust upon. Harry accepted the burden of command, acknowledging his responsibilities towards those who "followed" him. He did this regardless of how uncomfortable he might feel about the prospect and coordinating his efforts against his enemies well, when left with no other option but to take control. Harry's natural talents later served the rest of the wizarding community of Great Britain. In 2007 he was promoted to the Head of the Auror Office at age 26 and was later made the Head of Magical Law Enforcement. His promotion to these positions of power at relatively young ages demonstrated Harry's natural talent as a commander.
Indomitable willpower: Harry appeared to possess an unbreakable spirit and though not above depression, he never truly gave up on any mission. He had been shown to rise from defeat and loss, such as the deaths of many loved ones, even stronger than before. Harry's indomitable will was exemplified by his ability to resist the Imperius Curse and possibly, on the other hand, by his ability to cast powerful Imperius Curses. It was also exemplified by the fact that he had never begged for mercy (even in life-and-death situations), he would fight back in defiance of himself, as well as perform non-verbal spells flawlessly. His inability to perform Occlumency (despite possessing the required willpower) was due to his inability to keep his emotions under control.
Teaching skills: Harry demonstrated tremendous skill in teaching others. Having mastered many spells at a young age, Harry successfully taught them to others even when he was still a student himself. He would give proper instructions and corrections on how to perform many fields of magic, ranging from the relatively simplistic Disarming Charm to the highly advanced Patronus Charm. Harry's effectiveness as a teacher led many, some even older than him, to choose him over the Ministry-installed (but highly incompetent) teacher Dolores Umbridge. He even returned to Hogwarts to give occasional Defence Against the Dark Arts lectures as an adult and professional Auror. He kept his teaching aptitude in his later years and successfully instructed the members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force in the use of several formidable spells.
Possessions
Harry was a wealthy wizard, having inherited the Potter family fortune after his parents were murdered by Lord Voldemort. Harry relied on this gold for his school supplies, clothing, and other expenses. Following the death of his godfather Sirius Black, Harry became the sole heir of the Black family fortune as well.
Harry's first wand: 11", holly, and phoenix feather
Wand: Made of holly, a wood with the powers to repel evil, Harry's wand was "brothers" with Voldemort's wand as both had cores with feathers from the same phoenix, Fawkes. Harry's wand broke in 1997 during a skirmish with Nagini in Bathilda Bagshot's house due to a stray spell cast by Hermione Granger. Later he used the Elder Wand to repair it.
Draco Malfoy's wand: In 1998 Harry won the hawthorn wand's allegiance after overpowering Draco Malfoy during the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor. This wand was carried by him for the remainder of the Second Wizarding War; seeing action in the break-in at Gringotts, as well as during the final climactic Battle of Hogwarts. It is unknown what happened to the wand after Harry repaired his wand.
Photo album: In June of 1992 Hagrid gave Harry this photo album containing pictures of his parents, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and himself.
The Marauder's Map
Marauder's Map: One of Harry's most treasured possessions. In his third year, Fred Weasley and George Weasley gave it to Harry while he was trying to sneak into Hogsmeade. It was confiscated by Remus Lupin, but later returned when Lupin quit his job. Harry kept it with him for a long period of time, keeping it in the mokeskin wallet he had gotten from Hagrid, until it was finally stolen from his desk by his son, James.
Cloak of Invisibility: Another valued and useful possession is Harry's Cloak of Invisibility. In his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he received it as an anonymous Christmas gift. He later learned the gift came from Albus Dumbledore, who obtained it in turn from Harry's father, James Potter. It was later revealed to be a family heirloom as well as one of the three Deathly Hallows. From this Harry realises he is a direct descendant of Ignotus Peverell, one of the three brothers who created the Deathly Hallows. Harry later gave the Cloak to his eldest son, James Sirius.
Hedwig: Harry's animal companion, Hedwig was vitally helpful in delivering messages and packages for Harry, especially while Sirius was in hiding from the Ministry. Hedwig showed  affection by nibbling Harry's ear or fingers, and loyally obeyed his every command (even pecking Ron and Hermione until they answered back). Hedwig was killed during the Battle of the Seven Potters, and Harry was overcome with grief.
The Deathly Hallows (left to right): Cloak of Invisibility, Resurrection Stone, and the Elder Wand
Deathly Hallows: For a brief time, Harry was master of all three Deathly Hallows: the Cloak of Invisibility, the Resurrection Stone, and the Elder Wand (though he was not in physical possession of the Elder Wand until after losing the Resurrection Stone). These three artefacts are the most powerful magical items in all of the wizarding world and were so ancient that they were only the subject of fairy tales. When Harry lost the Resurrection Stone inside the Forbidden Forest, he decided to leave it there. Harry also interred the Elder Wand in Albus Dumbledore's grave, so the power of the wand would be extinguished after Harry's eventual death. However, the portrait of Dumbledore that hangs in the Headmaster's office advised Harry to keep the Invisibility cloak, since it was his father's.
Sword of Gryffindor
Godric Gryffindor's Sword: A relic of the founder of Harry's house, the goblin-made sword of Godric Gryffindor was left to Harry by his former Headmaster Albus Dumbledore in his will. However, the Ministry of Magic claimed that it was not Dumbledore's to give, and that it truly belonged to Hogwarts. Although the Ministry confiscated a replica of the sword, the true sword found its way into Harry's possession still through the machinations of Severus Snape. Soon after, Ron Weasley used it to destroy Slytherin's Locket, one of Voldemort's Horcruxes. Harry lost the sword to Griphook when he, Ron and Hermione Granger stole Hufflepuff's Cup from the Lestrange Vault at Gringotts. However, the sword reappeared in the hands of Neville Longbottom during the Battle of Hogwarts; he used it to kill Nagini, and thus destroyed the last of the Horcruxes. Neville was seen sitting beside the sword after the battle, but it is likely that it was returned to Hogwarts as a relic of the Founders, along with the remains of the other Founders' relics.
Enchanted knife: This magical knife, with the power to open most mechanical locks and magical seals and which Harry received for Christmas from Sirius Black, was melted when Harry tried it on a locked door at the Department of Mysteries. The protective enchantments on the door were far stronger than the magic of the enchanted knife.
A Firebolt, his second broom and a Christmas gift
Firebolt: During Harry's third year at Hogwarts, the Nimbus 2000 broomstick he'd been riding since his first year was destroyed by the Whomping Willow, and Sirius Black replaced it by giving Harry the finest broom available as an anonymous gift. The broom was one of Harry's most prized possessions for years. It was lost during the Battle of the Seven Potters. It is not known if Harry ever recovered or replaced it.
Nimbus 2000: This broomstick was gifted to him from Professor McGonagall after agreeing to join the Gryffindor Quidditch team in 1991. He used it during his first and second years at Hogwarts. In his third year it blew into the Whomping Willow and was smashed to bits, breaking it beyond repair.
Communication mirror: Harry also owns one in a pair of two-way mirrors, given to him by his godfather Sirius Black. The mirror was intended to be a means covert communication, but Harry broke it out of anger over Sirius' death. Harry did not realise the mirror could still work, although he kept a shard out of sentimentality. When Harry and several friends are captured at Malfoy Manor, at the time being used as a headquarters for Voldemort, Harry used the shard of mirror to communicate with Aberforth Dumbledore, who had the other mirror. Aberforth sent Dobby to rescue Harry and the other prisoners.
Schoolbag: A schoolbag was used by Harry Potter to carry around textbooks, quills, and other items throughout his six years attending Hogwarts. It is possible that this bag was used even in his Muggle education before attending Hogwarts.     Harry wearing a Weasley jumper  
Harry wearing a Weasley jumper
Weasley jumpers: Harry received a homemade jumper every Christmas from Mrs Weasley. His were said to be much more extravagant, as Mrs Weasley "made much more effort" when her presents were not made for actual family members. The known jumpers he has include an emerald green one, a scarlet one, a green one with a Hungarian Horntail on the front, and one with a Golden Snitch on the front.
Sneakoscope: Hermione Granger gave Harry a Sneakoscope as a gift for his seventeenth birthday at breakfast, the trio would later take it on their hunt for Horcruxes.
Alarm clock: In the summer of 1991, Harry found and repaired the alarm clock and in the summer of 1996, this alarm clock ticked on Harry's windowsill as he slept on the night that Albus Dumbledore came to collect him.
Golden Snitch: This Snitch was caught by Harry during the 1991–1992 school year. It was later left to him in Albus Dumbledore's will, to posthumously ensure that Marvolo Gaunt's Ring would be safely delivered to him.
Watch: This watch was used by Harry until it was destroyed in the Second Task of the Triwizard Tournament, since it was not waterproof and by May of 1995, he had discarded the watch entirely.
Harry's dress robes at the Yule Ball
Dress robes: Harry wore dress robes to the Yule Ball for the 1994 Triwizard Tournament, they were bottle green that matched his eyes. He also wore dress robes to Bill and Fleur's wedding in 1997. He also wore a set of dress robes to Slughorn's Christmas Party in 1996.
Fabian Prewett's watch: Molly Weasley gave Harry the watch of her late brother Fabian Prewett for his seventeenth birthday. It has a dent in it, but Harry kept the watch, even into his thirties. The watch does not have arms; rather, it has stars.
Mokeskin pouch: A birthday present from Hagrid. Harry kept it with him throughout the Deathly Hallows, and kept in it his treasures that were of no use to his search; the Snitch, the broken mirror, his broken wand, his mother's letter and the fake Horcrux. Harry also received a photo album, from Hagrid, which had photos of his parents and other family members.
Rucksack: This rucksack was owned by Harry during the 1997-1998 school year. He packed it with everything he felt he would need during the hunt for Horcruxes. He almost lost it during the Battle of the Seven Potters, but managed to keep hold of it.
Enchanted razor: In 1997, Harry received an enchanted razor on his seventeenth birthday from Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour. It is not known whether he used it at any point or if he still owns it.
Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts: This book had moving colour illustrations of all the counter-jinxes and hexes it described. Harry received a set of these books in 1995 as a Christmas present from Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. Harry planned to put them to good use in his lessons for Dumbledore's Army.
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: Harry owned a copy of this book, as was mandatory for any student of Hogwarts studying Care of Magical Creatures. He shared it with Ron Weasley after the latter lost his. The trio doodled and wrote messages to each other throughout the book.
Flying with the Cannons: Harry received a copy of this from Ron Weasley in 1992 as a Christmas present.
Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland: Hermione Granger gave this book to Harry in 1994, as a Christmas gift.
Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches: This book is a sophomoric manual on dating and flirting with girls. A copy was given to Harry on his seventeenth birthday from Ron Weasley. Harry speculated that there might be an entire chapter devoted to compliments.
Notebook: This notebook was owned by Harry from at least 1997. It was used to keep his notes and other writings, such as things he wanted to remember.
Toy broomstick: this was a gift to him from Sirius Black, it was the first broomstick he had ridden. It's unknown what happened to it after the 1981 attack at Godric's Hollow.
Car: This car was used by Harry to drive his family to King's Cross Station on 1 September, 2017. On Platform 9¾, Ron Weasley asked Harry if he had parked the vehicle alright, then told him he had managed to park his own car.
Family home: Sometime following the war, Harry acquired his own house and raised his three children there alongside his wife, Ginny. This can be assumed due to Harry denying James' request to have Teddy move in with them in exchange for sharing a room with his younger brother. Harry replied that he would only allow the two Potter brothers to share a room when "[he wanted] the house demolished."


12 Grimmauld Place, London
12 Grimmauld Place: Following Sirius's death, Harry inherited his family's London townhouse with all its contents and furnishings, including Kreacher (the family house-elf). Mundungus Fletcher would continue stealing many of Harry's inherited possessions, including Slytherin's Locket, as he had stolen from Sirius. Harry, Ron, and Hermione hid out there in August and September 1997.
Motorbike: As one of Sirius's possessions, it was left to Harry in his will. Despite the severe damage done to it in the Battle of the Seven Potters, Arthur Weasley managed to repair the bike and returned it to Harry. Harry presumably learned to ride it sometime after the war. Given the ease with which he learned to fly a broomstick, ride animals such as hippogriffs and thestrals, and even a dragon, Harry likely learned how to ride with very little trouble at all.
Relationships
Throughout his life, Harry has had many relationships with a variety of people. Because of his upbringing, he had few connections in his early years, the only people he truly interacted with being the abusive Dursleys. With his introduction to the wizarding world, this changed and he built connections with many of the residents of the magical community, both good and bad. His strongest relationships were with: his parents, his children, Hermione Granger, the Weasley family, Sirius Black, Hedwig, Dobby, Albus Dumbledore, Rubeus Hagrid, Minerva McGonagall, Remus Lupin, Neville Longbottom, Cho Chang, Luna Lovegood and Teddy Lupin.

Etymology
Harry is the Middle English form of the name Henry, derived from the Germanic name Heinrich, from the words heim, meaning "home", and ric, meaning "power, ruler". It has been a very popular name in the English-speaking world for centuries. Harry can also be a diminutive form of the name Harold, from the Old English name Hereweald, meaning "leader of the army". It has been the name of five kings of Norway, three kings of Denmark, and two kings of England. In an interview J. K. Rowling stated that 'Harry' had always been one of her favourite boy's names and that if her daughter had been a son she would have named him 'Harry', although then she would have to have come up with a different name for the books as it "would have been too cruel to name him after my own son". It is possible that he was named after Henry Potter, nicknamed 'Harry', who was James' grandfather and Harry's great-grandfather. 

James is derived from the same Hebrew name as Jacob, meaning “holds the heel” (in the Genesis narrative, Jacob was born grasping Esau′s heel and later bought his birthright). The name came into English language from the French variation of the Late Latin name Iacomus, a dialect variant of Iacobus, from the New Testament Greek Ἰάκωβος (Iakōbos), from Hebrew word יעקב (Yaʻaqov). James is Harry's middle name, James was the name of his father and is also the name of his first son.

Potter is a very common surname of English origin. It traditionally refers to the occupation of making pottery. Beatrix Potter was a well-known English children's author. Potter's Field is the name for a burial ground for the unknown or unclaimed dead, particularly soldiers and orphans; the Potter family had many members that fit that description. The Potter Box is a model for making ethical decisions developed at Harvard University. J. K. Rowling has also commented that she has liked the name since childhood, as a family that had lived near her carried this surname. The last name "Potter" was also carried by the first successful magician in 1811 in America named Richard Potter who also happened to be African-American, the land that was bought by the magician and where Potter lived was called "Potter Place".

He often describes various parts of his anatomy as feeling like lead.
The Marauders believed they discovered more secret places than anyone else in the history of Hogwarts. This is not necessarily true, as unlike Harry and Tom Riddle, they did not discover the Chamber of Secrets or the Room of Requirement. However, as they discovered an untold number of secret passages and hidden rooms, they did discover more numerous secrets than Riddle or Harry, just not the same ones.
Like his best friend Ron Weasley, Harry got a Muggle driving licence and bought himself a car, but it was never said if they got the Licence to Apparate (although, both of them having been Aurors, most likely they did).
The only autographs he ever gave out were to Colin Creevey and an unknown man on the Hogwarts Express.
Harry Potter is still the only wizard to this day that has had all three Unforgivable Curses cast on him and survived.
He also used two out of the three: the Cruciatus Curse and the Imperius Curse. The only one he never used was the Killing Curse, which on the contrary is his nemesis' favourite spell.

Like his parents, Harry personally defied Voldemort three times before defeating him the fourth time: once in the Underground Chambers, once at the cemetery in Little Hangleton, and once again during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. However, there were five previous encounters, if one counts the events of Harry's second year with Tom Riddle's Diary, though that was a memory instead of the real Voldemort, and the night his parents were killed in Godric's Hollow.
Harry's initial trouble with Potions is somewhat ironic as he has famous potioneers in his family, notably Linfred of Stinchcombe ("the Potterer") who first established the family fortune with his medicinal potions and Fleamont Potter who was said to have quadrupled the fortune with his Sleekeazy's Hair Potion. According to Horace Slughorn, Harry's mother Lily was also an accomplished potioneer in her own right. Some of this does come from Harry's enmity with Severus Snape but it is portrayed as his weakness. However, he makes strides in later novels.
Despite Remus Lupin suggested him not to let the Expelliarmus become his signature spell, this was the very spell which Harry used in his last duel against Voldemort.
The only person Harry ever considered killing by use of curse was Sirius Black and possibly Bellatrix Lestrange, ironically to avenge Sirius. It is, however, unclear if Harry knew how to cast the Avada Kedavra curse since he was not taught the Unforgivable Curses until his fourth year. Furthermore, when Harry found out that Peter Pettigrew was the one who had betrayed his parents to Voldemort, he did not want Sirius and Remus Lupin to kill Pettigrew in revenge. Even during the Battle of Hogwarts, in which Harry defeated Lord Voldemort, Harry did not do so by use of any curse intended to do harm to his opponent, but rather he used his "trademark", Expelliarmus. Harry finished Voldemort by reflecting a curse Harry would never use on another, even his mortal enemy. This suggests the love, which is "the power the Dark Lord knows not..." makes it difficult for Harry to kill. Even during the Battle of the Seven Potters, Harry illustrated his unwillingness to kill Death Eaters. During that battle, the Death Eaters were masked at the time, so he could not know who was a willing follower and who was a controlled drone. However, in the example with Voldemort, Harry knew Voldemort's Killing Curse would backfire, so rather than use the same curse which would make him look somewhat bad, he instead decided to use the Disarming Charm to gain possession of the wand.
Harry was very much like Newton Scamander as they both didn't seek power nor popularity and also was liked by the same person, Albus Dumbledore.
Harry learns a new mode of transportation in every year since he was introduced to magic:
In his first year, he learns to travel by broomstick.
In his second year, he travels by Floo Powder and Flying Ford Anglia.
In his third year, he travels on the Knight Bus and Buckbeak the hippogriff lets him take a ride on his back.
In his fourth year, he gets to the Quidditch World Cup by portkey.
In his fifth year, he travels to the Ministry of Magic by Thestral.
In his sixth year, he learns to Apparate.
In what would have been his seventh year, he breaks into Gringotts and flies out on a dragon.

Despite being a talented Quidditch player (and the team Seeker, considered the most important player on the team), Harry never played a full season (every minute of all three matches):
In his first year, he was recuperating in the hospital wing after saving the Philosopher's Stone, and thus missed the final match.
In his second year, the final match of the season was cancelled due to the attack on Hermione and Penelope Clearwater.
In his third year, Harry came closest to playing a full season, but spent the last few seconds of the opening Gryffindor vs. Hufflepuff match unconscious after being attacked by Dementors.
In his fourth year, the Quidditch Cup was cancelled due to the Triwizard Tournament.
In his fifth year, Harry was banned by Dolores Umbridge after the opening Gryffindor vs. Slytherin match.
In his sixth year, Harry was knocked unconscious partway through the second match of the season against Hufflepuff, and then held in detention for the final match against Ravenclaw.
In what would have been his seventh year, he didn't attend Hogwarts due to his quest to destroy the Horcruxes.

Harry is portrayed by British actor Daniel Radcliffe in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Part 2 and so is one of the 14 characters to appear in all 8 film adaptations. By the time Deathly Hallows: Part 2 was released, Radcliffe had played the role for ten years consecutively.
Harry has green eyes, but in the films he has blue eyes. This is due to the fact that Daniel Radcliffe was allergic to the contact lenses. Radcliffe also has brown hair, as opposed to Harry's black hair, and also has a strong physical body, rather than the slim frame Harry is described as having. However Harry is only described as having an uncommonly 'slim' frame in the earlier instalments, so it is possible that he bulked out a little into a lean frame as he matured.
The first actor to be cast as Harry was actually American actor Liam Aiken,[citation needed] but he lost the part the next day, allegedly because he wasn't British.
Daniel Radcliffe never provided voice-acting for any of the Harry Potter video games. Harry is instead voiced by Joe Sowerbutts in the Philosopher's Stone video game, Tom Attenborough in the Chamber of Secrets video game, both Tom Attenborough and Harry Robinson in the Prisoner of Azkaban video game, Daniel Larner in the Goblet of Fire video game, both Daniel Larner and Adam Sopp in the Order of the Phoenix video game, and again by Adam Sopp in the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Deathly Hallows: Part 2 video games.
Josh Herdman plays Harry when he is disguised as Gregory Goyle in Chamber of Secrets, as does David O'Hara when he is disguised as Albert Runcorn in Deathly Hallows: Part 1. The Saunders triplets play Harry as an infant in Philosopher's Stone and Toby Papworth plays Harry as an infant in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.

Harry is portrayed by British actor Jamie Parker in the original West End production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.
The first spell casted on Harry, Reparo, used by Hermione Granger on the Hogwarts Express during their first encounter, is also the last spell used by Harry in the novels.
Harry is right-handed. He tells this to Mr Ollivander in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. He is also seen writing with this hand throughout the film series.
Several undisclosed theories suggest that, as per the prophecy, Voldemort was the only one capable of killing Harry. Meaning that, with Voldemort dead, Harry cannot be killed, though he can presumably still die of natural causes.
Still, in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Harry was killed by Lord Voldemort in an alternate universe.

Several times throughout Cursed Child, Harry has been called "savior of the wizarding world", it is unknown whether this is a given title or an alias that has been given to Harry in his older age. Although, this places Harry higher in respect than Dumbledore, in his defeat of an internationally wanted wizard.
In the whole Harry Potter series, Harry has only called Draco Malfoy by just his first name two times.
The first time was when they were in detention in the Forbidden Forest in their first year.
The second and last time he called Draco Malfoy by his first name was during the final duel with Voldemort in the Great Hall, when Harry talked about the mastery of the Elder wand. He said that Voldemort wasn't the master of the Elder Wand, Draco was.

While Harry repeatedly states Hermione is the best student in his year in all classes, he likely simply meant she is the best student overall, for he has beaten her in two of the three Defence Against the Dark Arts exams they had together, with Hermione only beating him in their first year exam.
In addition, Rowling has said that Harry could have beaten Hermione in a magical duel halfway through Prisoner of Azkaban. Part of this can be put down to Professor Lupin's way of teaching, which preferred practical lessons over theory, as it seemed to help bring out Harry's own talent at the subject.

Harry's birthday of 31 July is also the birthday of Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling and actor Richard Griffiths, who played Harry's uncle Vernon Dursley in the Harry Potter films.
In addition to Rowling and Griffiths, Harry's star sign Leo, a lion, also the sign of the Gryffindor house, was shared by Ginny and Harry's portrayer Daniel Radcliffe, who was born on 23 July.
On his famous wizard card shown in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game), Harry's year of birth was not given, instead question marks were shown, indicating his year of birth may not have been made public in the wizarding world.

In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, despite Harry's birthday being on July 31st in the books, it seems that it was moved to August 31st, because Hagrid first met Harry in the shack on the day of Harry's birthday, then he took Harry to Diagon Alley and then to King's Cross the next day, where Harry took the Hogwarts Express.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry is seen practising Lumos Maxima under the covers in his bedroom, but Harry does not get a letter from the Improper Use of Magic Office even though he is under-age, however, judging by the book he is reading, his reason for doing so is most likely for homework. In the book he is simply using a torch while writing his homework for History of Magic.
A running gag in the books is the messiness of Harry's hair. In the films, this is not mentioned except for a reference in the fourth film. Harry notices that Hagrid has combed his hair so he will look good for Olympe Maxime. When Harry says to him, "Hagrid, have you combed your hair?!" Hagrid states, "As a matter of fact, I have. You might wanna try the same thing now and again".
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Harry tells Dumbledore at the train station that he likes riding around on trains as it takes his mind off things.
In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Ginny and Neville are both climbing up on one of the staircases, and run into Harry during the battle. Neville ask Harry if he has seen Luna Lovegood, then he confesses to Ginny and Harry that he as feelings for Luna, he went away to find and tell her. Harry and Ginny share a quick kiss, Harry was going to tell Ginny that he loved her, but Ginny quickly told him that she knows, and they both went back to what they were doing before they met up. This did not happen in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows book.
In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2: Behind the Magic, the person who makes all the wands for the films revealed that Dan has gone through over 80 wands over the course of the ten years because he drums with them.
In a deleted scene of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, when he is disguised as Albert Runcorn, Harry calls Arthur Weasley by his first name. This is the only time Harry does this.
In the films:
Harry is shown to wear the colour blue in nearly all his clothing. It could possibly connect with the symbolic meanings of the colour to be that of; trust, wisdom, loyalty, confidence, intelligence, faith, truth and heaven. These particular attributes are significantly linked to Harry's personality throughout the series.
Harry's hair grows longer and longer (the longest point was in Goblet of Fire) until it was cut for Order of the Phoenix. It has since grown to about the same length as it was for Prisoner of Azkaban.
Harry's scar is off-centre on his forehead; this was apparently done at J. K. Rowling's request: because of the books' artwork, many fans believe the scar is in the centre of his head. But it is never explicitly mentioned where the scar is located. On all the U.S. book covers (illustrations), the scar on Harry's forehead is located in the centre. The same is definitely true of the last two U.K. instalments; however, on early U.K. book covers, Harry's scar tends to appear slightly off-centre. It is somewhat hard to tell on most of these covers, as Harry's face is only visible in profile. However, on the U.K. cover of Chamber of Secrets, Harry's scar is decidedly off-centre. It is perhaps of this book that Rowling was thinking.     Harry Potter in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4

A variant of Harry is available in the "Downloadable Character Pack" DLC for LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7. The variant is called "Harry (Yule Ball)" because it portrays Harry wearing the dress robes he wore to the Yule Ball.
Harry has the last line in many of the books, and if not, he makes the last gesture.
"I'm going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer." (PS)
"All those times I could've died and I didn't manage it? They'll be furious!" (CS)
"He likes to keep in touch with me, ...keep up with my news...check I'm happy." (POA)
"Harry-thanks." Harry winked at them. (Spoken by George Weasley) (GOF)
"Really soon Harry, we promise." Harry nodded. (Spoken by Hermione Granger) (OOTP)
"Yeah we shouldn't miss that [ Bill and Fleur's Wedding ]." (HBP)
"I know he will." (DH)

Harry usually has the last line in every Harry Potter film. Though it could be debatable on whether he has the last line of the second film since the closed captions say that Dean said, "Yes!", so he may have had the last line.
"I'm not going home...not really.." (PS/SS)
"There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid." (CS)
"Lumos. I solemnly swear that I am up to no good"/"Nox."" (POA)
"Yeah. Every week." (GOF)
"Something worth fighting for." (OOTP)
"I never realised how beautiful this place was." (HBP)
"I want to bury him [ Dobby ]... without magic." (DHPt1)
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is the only film in which Harry does not speak the final line. It is spoken by his son Albus: "Ready." However, it is also obvious that it's mostly Harry's other son James who says the last line in this film to Albus just before he (Albus) sits down next to his brother: "Come on."

Harry was Wizard of the Month on J. K. Rowling's official site for the month of October 2007.
Harry is the inspiration for the Wizard rock band, Harry and the Potters.
The makers of the film X-Men: First Class used Harry Potter as their role model.
Author's comments
Harry Potter is J. K. Rowling's favourite character, though she feels that she is unusual in this, as she finds that Ron is generally more popular.
A rumour circulating on the Internet stated that early drafts of the second half of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire included a scene in which Harry lost his virginity, but that this scene was cut to avoid complaints from parents. J. K. Rowling confirmed that this rumour was false, however, later further clarifying that she "never wrote it, never announced it, and never edited it out".
In a PotterCast interview, Rowling says when Harry faced Voldemort in the forest and didn't defend himself that she never saw like a scientific equation and that Harry wasn't guaranteed to survive,  there has to be space, to make Harry truly heroic, for free will. It has to be his choice. The whole thing's his choice. He chooses to sacrifice himself just as Lily chose to sacrifice herself. He chooses to pull himself back to life, and that's his own will and courage. So ultimately, those things, all of them were more important than the magic.
J.K. Rowling has stated:
Because of the demands of his life, Harry has had less sexual experience than boys of his age might have had.
Harry's glasses are a clue to his vulnerability.
The character of Wart from T. H. White's The Sword in the Stone is "Harry's spiritual ancestor".

"It was not an arbitrary decision: holly has certain connotations that were perfect for Harry, particularly when contrasted with the traditional associations of yew, from which Voldemort’s wand is made. European tradition has it that the holly tree (the name comes from ‘holy’) repels evil, while yew, which can achieve astonishing longevity (there are British yew trees over two thousand years old), can symbolise both death and resurrection; the sap is also poisonous. Some time after I had given Harry his holly-and-phoenix wand I came across a description of how the Celts had assigned trees to different parts of the year and discovered that, entirely by coincidence, I had assigned Harry the ‘correct’ wood for his day of birth."
