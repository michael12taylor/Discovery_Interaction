<html><p>In the Harry Potter films, a portrait of Scamander is present in the Headmaster's office, thus implying that he was a past Headmaster of Hogwarts and that he had died at some point in the more ambiguous present day timeline of the films.
Interestingly, the portrait of Newt Scamander mentioned above bears the monogram of Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528). Dürer's dates do not match those of Scamander the slightest. The portrait itself seems to have been based on a 17th-century portrait of Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll, by David Scougall.
A wanted poster from the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them states that Newt was 6'2", 159 lbs, of red-brown hair and blue eyes, however, his official Ministry of Magic Identification card from Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald states that Newt was instead 6'1", 161 lbs, of brown hair and hazel eyes.
In 2001, J. K. Rowling published a real version of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them for Comic Relief, a UK based charity event. The book was written from an in-universe perspective, and Scamander was credited as the "author" of the book. The original book was updated in 2017 after the character appeared as the star character in the film named directly after it.
Newt was the first known Hufflepuff introduced in the series, although this information was not revealed until  Pottermore clarified his house.
When Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was originally translated into German, Newt's name was translated as "Lurch" Scamander. Lurch is a German word for amphibians, a family of animals the newt is also part of. When Fantastic Beasts was translated, his original first name was untranslated instead and Lurch was one of his middle names. This makes his full name in the German version "Newton Artemis Fido Lurch Scamander".
Similarly, in the French version of the Harry Potter books, he is named "Norbert Dragonneau" (Dragonneau meaning baby dragon), a possible foreshadowing to Norberta. In the translation of Fantastic Beasts, however, it is said that this is actually a pen name, and the book uses his original name the rest of the time. Even though it's a pen name, the name "Norbert Dragonneau" is used in the French and French Canadian versions of the first film of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

While never specifically confirmed to play Quidditch, when Mary Lou Barebone asks him if he is a "seeker of truth," he replies "I'm more of a chaser, really."
While using the swooping evil to catch Grindelwald in the film version, the screenplay for the films states that he uses his wand.
Originally the visual artists crafted expansive environments for all the creatures in Newt's case; however, J.K. Rowling informed that he wasn't that great of a wizard and they scaled them down to be backdrops creating a sufficient semblance of the creatures' natural habitats.
Strangely, despite Newt being shown to be a loyal ally of Dumbledore as well as having played several key roles against Grindelwald, there is no mention of Newt having participated in either the First or Second Wizarding Wars against Lord Voldemort. He does not appear in the photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix and is not mentioned by Alastor Moody when showing the photograph to Harry. There is a chance however that he merely wasn't present for that particular photo and that he simply never encountered Harry.
It's possible that Newt attended Dumbledore's funeral in The Half Blood Prince and was unnamed, as it is stated that Harry did not recognise the majority of wizards who attended.
When asked by a fan about why Dumbledore would send Newt to take down Grindelwald when experienced aurors couldn't do it J.K. Rowling said that she could write an essay but that it would give away the whole plot of the Fantastic Beasts franchise.
When asked by the press if Newt will remain central to the franchise, David Heyman said yes, confirming that Newt was "the key to all this".
J.K. Rowling also confirmed Newt would remain the main character.

A scar from a Murtlap bite on Newt's left hand
Newt has four distinctive scars on his left hand resembling a Murtlap bite. This would explain how Newt knew what a "bad reaction" entailed, since no wizards before Newt dared to go near a Murtlap.
Eddie Redmayne has stated that he thinks that Newt is autistic. This would be consistent with Newt's disregard for many social norms, aversion to physical or eye contact, and firm sense of who he is, not to mention his own single-minded focus on his topics of perseverance and penchant for unorthodox solutions to daunting tasks.
Although having had been suggested in the novels that if a student is expelled from Hogwarts, their wand would be broken, Newt owned and used a wand in his adult years.
Anyway, both Hagrid and Harry Potter, whose expulsion was reconsidered by the Ministry, were expelled after Newt. It might be possible that the Ministry introduced this particular law between 1914 circa (date of Newt's expulsion) and 1942/43, as Newt was allowed to keep his wand.

When J. K. Rowling was asked about the form of Newt Scamander's Patronus, she said that it would be a spoiler to future films of the Fantastic Beasts film series.
Newt was very much like Harry Potter, as they both didn't seek power nor popularity and also was liked by the same person, Albus Dumbledore. They are also both the main character and protagonist of their respective series in the Wizarding World franchise.

 Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them only identifies Newt's mother as a witch, so his father's blood status is unknown. Also, The Sacred Twenty Eight directory, published in the 1930s, does not list the Scamander family as Pure-blood; however, other pure-blood families such as the Potters are not listed either so the directory is not definitive.

 Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay, Scene 65

 J. K. Rowling has stated on two occasions that Newt was expelled from Hogwarts, once in a documentary about the making of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and another time in a video interview with SnitchSeeker. However, on a prop document featured in the first Fantastic Beasts film and reproduced in The Case of Beasts: Explore the Film Wizardry of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, it is stated that "the expulsion was never enforced" because Albus Dumbledore's intervention "result[ed] in his name being cleared." Miraphora Mina, one of the graphic artists who worked on the film, revealed in an interview that Rowling was consulted during the creation of the props to ensure the accuracy of text on them. Thus, it cannot be conclusively determined whether Newt was actually expelled at this point, as it is not known which canon supersedes the other. It is possible that J. K. Rowling's statements that Newt was expelled were a deliberate attempt at withholding information to prevent spoilers.
