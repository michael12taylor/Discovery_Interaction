<html><p>Molly's love and sense of protection for her family - especially the youngest members - was apparent in the form her boggart took: Her greatest fear was her family, including Harry, lying dead on the floor. Her fear of seeing her family dead was partially realised when Fred was killed during the Battle of Hogwarts, especially since one of the forms that her boggart took was the dead bodies of the twins. 

Molly loved all of her children, but she seemed especially fond of her youngest child and only daughter, Ginny, whom she passed most moments with. When she saw Ginny being fought by Bellatrix Lestrange, the mere possibility of losing her only daughter was enough to make her openly challenge and kill the most dangerous Dark witch of that age. Also, Molly was notable for extending her familial affections to those who weren't related to her, including Ron's best friends.

Molly was heartbroken when the "high achiever", Percy, turned his back on his family in favour of pursuing his career at the Ministry. She tried to get him to return several times but to no avail, often crying over his departure and continued to send him gifts like her hand-knitted Christmas jumpers, which he would coldly return without a note. Despite his aloof departure, Molly remained affectionate towards her third son, using his good behaviour as reference when scolding the twins for overusing their magic for the simplest matter and masking his defection by making excuses for him such as being too busy at the Ministry to return home for Christmas. After Percy apologised to the whole family, Molly was not shown to have any problems in forgiving him.

After the Second Wizarding War, Molly's family expanded even further, having many grandchildren through her sons and daughter: Victoire, Dominique and Louis, Bill and Fleur Delacour's children; Molly (who was named after her) and Lucy, Percy and Audrey's daughters; Fred and Roxanne, George and Angelina Johnson's children; Rose and Hugo, Ron and Hermione's children; and James, Albus and Lily, Ginny and Harry's children. Based on her affection for her family, it is likely that Molly was a devoted grandmother.

Harry Potter
Harry Potter, her future son-in-law
Molly first met Harry while taking her sons to the Hogwarts Express. She took pity on him for being alone, as he seemed to be a sweet and polite boy. Upon being told by Fred and George who he was, Molly was adamant that her children not pester Harry about his past, stating that he would probably get enough attention and instructing them not to add to it. After getting to know more about Harry through Ron, Molly began treating him as another member of the family, whether it be by letting him stay at the Burrow for the school holidays or fussing over the state of his health and making sure he had additional helpings during meals, although she tended to avoid the subject of the Dursleys when Harry brought them up even briefly. She also sent Harry a Weasley jumper and a large box of fudge or mince pies every Christmas, even after the two of them had only spoken briefly at King's Cross during Harry's first year, simply because Ron had mentioned that Harry wasn't expecting any presents.

Molly greeting Harry, whom she views as another son
Molly would occasionally forget she wasn't Harry's mother and tended to be as protective of him as if he was one of her own children, a sentiment Harry himself shared. She was deeply affected when Harry was forced to compete in the Triwizard Tournament, to the point that her attitude towards Hermione temporarily became almost hostile because she assumed Rita Skeeter's claims that Hermione was toying with Harry's emotions until Harry himself assured her otherwise. Molly pushed particularly hard for Harry not to be "burdened" with the knowledge of certain aspects of the Order of the Phoenix's business involving Voldemort, which caused her to come into conflict with Harry's godfather, Sirius Black and even her own husband. She showed her over-protective nature again upon discovering that Harry, Ron, and Hermione weren't intending to return to Hogwarts during their final year, demanding to be informed of their intentions and even did everything in her power to prevent them having any opportunity to discuss their plans in secret. The form of Molly's boggart, which reflected her greatest fear of seeing her family dead by appearing as their dead bodies, included Harry's own corpse. In return, Harry was grateful to her for the love and protection he needed and wanted. After Molly killed Bellatrix, Voldemort prepared to attack her in revenge, prompting Harry to reveal his continued existence rather than continuing his attempts to to attack from under his Invisibility Cloak.

Sometime after the Second Wizarding War, Harry married Ginny, becoming Molly's son-in-law and officially joining the Weasley family. He is also the father of three of Molly's grandchildren: James Sirius, Albus Severus and Lily Luna Potter.

Hermione Granger
Hermione Granger, her future daughter-in-law
Because of her friendships with Ron and Ginny, Hermione became friendly with the entire Weasley family. She spent portions of many of her summer holidays at the Burrow and attended some family outings with them, such as shopping for school supplies in Diagon Alley and the 1994 Quidditch World Cup. Molly was generally fond of Hermione, though she treated her coldly for a brief time after Rita Skeeter printed lies about Hermione toying with the hearts of Harry and Viktor Krum, much to Hermione's bewilderment and dejection. After Harry explained that the stories were false, she once again warmed up to Hermione.

Hermione became one of Molly's four daughters-in-law when she married Ron sometime after the Second Wizarding War. Hermione is the mother of two of Molly's grandchildren: Rose and Hugo Granger-Weasley.

Fleur Delacour
Fleur Delacour, her daughter-in-law
The Weasleys' reaction to Fleur (with the exceptions of Ron and Arthur) was initially lukewarm. They became more annoyed with Fleur when she and Bill became engaged, but tolerated her presence for his sake. In particular, Molly didn't like Fleur and was irked by the latter's criticism of her household or even her favourite singer Celestina Warbeck. 

When Fleur indignantly denied that Bill's disfigurement at the hands of Fenrir Greyback would affect their marital plans in any way, the Weasleys saw how deeply Fleur loved Bill and finally became more accepting of her. Molly convinced her aunt Muriel to lend her future daughter-in-law a tiara for the wedding. Fleur was noted as fussing over and being protective of Harry, Ron, and Hermione in a motherly fashion, similar to Molly.

After the Second Wizarding War, Molly had three grandchildren through Fleur.

Nymphadora Tonks
Nymphadora Tonks, her friend
Molly had a rather close relationship with Auror and fellow Order member, Nymphadora Tonks. Molly often invited Tonks to dine with the Weasley family and the young witch was always a welcome guest at the events held by the Weasley matriarch. Molly would at times get annoyed at Tonks due to her clumsiness, but never out of dislike for her. Rather it was mostly due to the fact that Tonks' attempts at helping resulting in her causing minor annoyances, such as setting off the Portrait of Walburga Black at 12 Grimmauld Place. During these times, Molly would attempt to dissuade Tonks from helping, so as to avoid such accidents.

Though there was a significant difference in age between the two, Molly appeared to be Tonks's closest adult friend: She appeared to be the only person in whom Tonks confided her love of Remus Lupin. Several people suspected that Molly hoped her son Bill Weasley would fall in love with Tonks, rather than marry Fleur Delacour and Harry Potter noted Molly was acting somewhat frosty toward Lupin during the 1996 Christmas holidays, though he misinterpreted the reason why. Molly reacted heatedly to disparaging remarks made by Fleur in regards to Tonks, which is indicative of the high opinion she held for the young Auror. At the conclusion of the Battle of Hogwarts, it was Molly who duelled and killed Tonks' murderer and aunt Bellatrix, therefore avenging Tonks' death.

Order of the Phoenix members
The original Order of the Phoenix, her allies
Molly considered Albus Dumbledore to be the greatest wizard of all time. During the Second Wizarding War, she was technically the first new recruit of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation both founded and led by Dumbledore, having been asked to help battle against Voldemort almost immediately after his return was discovered. Along with most of the wizarding world, Molly was devastated by Dumbledore's death, and attended his funeral in 1997.

Remus Lupin was close with the Weasley family, joined the re-instated Order, and saw Molly on a fairly regular basis. Lupin helped Molly get rid of a boggart that took the form of her family and Harry Potter dead; confessing to him that she was afraid of what would happen to her children and husband. Lupin comforted her, saying that he and the other members of the Order would take care of her family. After Dumbledore's death, Molly expressed her opinion that Lupin and Tonks should be together, as they loved each other, despite Lupin's protests that he was too old, too poor, and too dangerous for Tonks. During the Battle of the Seven Potters, Lupin saved George's life from Death Eaters, for which Molly was incredibly grateful. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Lupin and Tonks were killed, showing Molly grieving near their bodies.

Molly initially believed Sirius Black (her "cousin by marriage", as his aunt Lucretia married her uncle Ignatius) was a murderer, who had betrayed the Potter family to Lord Voldemort in 1981, and didn't learn of his innocence until 1995. While both Sirius and Molly lived at 12 Grimmauld Place, they argued over the latter's tendency to be overprotective of Sirius's godson Harry: Sirius reminded her she wasn't Harry's mother, while Molly considered Sirius to be too reckless and reminded him that Harry wasn't his father James. Nonetheless, they got along well for the most part, as Sirius was thrilled at having the Weasley family and Harry Potter stay at Grimmauld place over the 1995 winter holidays. Molly was greatly saddened by Sirius's death in 1996 and was ultimately the one to kill Bellatrix, Sirius's cousin and murderer.

Molly worked fairly closely with the late Alastor Moody and Kingsley Shacklebolt, being on good terms with both of them. She was shocked by Moody's death in 1997. Kingsley was responsible for saving countless lives when he sent his Patronus to warn the attendees of Bill and Fleur's wedding that the Ministry had fallen in 1997 and later became Minister for Magic, employing a number of the members of Molly's family.

Molly was friendly with Minerva McGonagall, the former Transfiguration professor and Head of Gryffindor House, the house into which all the members of the Weasley family had been sorted. The two discussed Dumbledore's death in 1997. McGonagall would have been Headmistress while several of Molly's grandchildren attended the school.

The Weasley family were all fond of Rubeus Hagrid, the gamekeeper and later Care of Magical Creatures professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He fought alongside Molly at the Battle of Hogwarts and they both survived the war. He appeared to be friendly with Molly's grandchildren, as seen by his inviting Albus to his house for tea.

Molly seemed to be on good terms with Severus Snape, despite the fact that he disliked her children. However, she and her family obviously turned against him when they learnt he killed Dumbledore, but it was most likely that this changed when she learned of Snape's true loyalties from Harry. In addition, Harry and Ginny would later name one of Molly's grandsons after Snape.

Etymology
Molly is a diminutive form of Mary, the English form of the Hebrew name Miryam, the meaning of which is unknown, though theories include "sea of bitterness", "rebelliousness", "wished for child", and "beloved". In the case of Molly Weasley, however, the name is most likely derived from the term "mollycoddle," meaning to "to pamper or overprotect."

The surname Prewett is Welsh in origin. It is derived from the Middle English word prou, meaning "brave" or "valiant", and the suffix "-et", which implies smallness. Thus, it is believed to be derived from a nickname for someone small, but brave.

Weasley is derived from the weasel, an animal J. K. Rowling is fond of. The term is especially appropriate for Molly, as a mother weasel is particularly protective of her young to the point that she will willingly take on animals several times bigger than her in defence of her offspring.

Behind the scenes

Molly Weasley as seen in Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells
Her husband's pet name for her, "Mollywobbles", may be a pun on "the collywobbles", British slang for a queasy stomach, especially when caused by anxiety. Possibly in reference to her constant fretting over the welfare of her loved ones.
Contrary to rumours among fans that Neville Longbottom would be the one to kill Bellatrix Lestrange, J. K. Rowling stated she had always intended for Molly to be the one to do it, for two main reasons: firstly, so that Molly could "have her moment" and show that simply because she had dedicated herself to her family did not mean that she was not a powerful witch, and secondly, to show the clash of Molly's "maternal love" against Bellatrix's "obsessive love".
Molly is portrayed by British actress Julie Walters in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Part 2.
In 1999, when Warner Bros. was casting for the first film, Rosie O'Donnell had admitted to loving the books so much, she called the studio and asked to play Mrs Weasley without receiving payment. Chris Columbus called her afterwards, declining her offer as they wanted a strictly British cast. The aftermath resulted in Molly Weasley's signature in the books being hand-written by Rosie O'Donnell in order to fulfil her wish in some small way.
In the credits of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, she is listed as "Mrs Molly Weasley", while in the credits of the other films, she is just listed as "Molly Weasley".
Julie Walters' favourite line in the films is "Not my daughter, you bitch!" from Deathly Hallows: Part 2.

"A hug from Mrs Weasley" on  Pottermore
"A hug from Mrs Weasley" was one out of the thirty-two options generated by an old feature on  Pottermore, "Wonderful wizarding world happiness generator", which was about things that could cast away the Blue Monday blues.
The description was "When Harry witnessed the return of Lord Voldemort, only one thing could comfort him afterwards: a warm, motherly hug from Mrs Weasley. And now here's one for you".

Notes and references
 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 Mugglenet - JKR Birthday Archive

 2.0 2.1 2.2 Bill Weasley is the oldest Weasley child and was born 29 November 1970.(Pottermore - Bill Weasley & HPL Lexicon - The Age of the Weasleys). Molly says that the Whomping Willow (planted 1971) was after her time at Hogwarts (GOF, Ch. 31) and that Molly and Arthur eloped soon after graduation. (HBP - Ch. 5). In order for Bill to be conceived in wedlock, Molly must have graduated by June 1969. Given her October birthday, this graduation date requires she started Hogwarts in 1962 and was born 1950. However, as Arthur Weasley was born 6 February 1950 ( Pottermore) he would have graduated June 1968, so if he and Molly were in the same year, she would have been born in 1949

 Sirius Black stated in Ch. 6 of Order of the Phoenix that Molly Weasley was his "cousin by marriage". This means that Ignatius could not have been Molly, Fabian, and Gideon's father, as this would have made them first cousins by blood of Sirius. Ignatius was Sirius's uncle by marriage, and if Molly was his niece, this could explain Sirius's comment. See this talk page for more information.
