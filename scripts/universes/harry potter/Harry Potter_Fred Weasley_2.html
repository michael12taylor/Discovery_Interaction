<html><p>Lee Jordan was best friends with Fred and George during his time at Hogwarts, and often got into trouble along with them. They were good friends and they both appeared to have affection for Angelina Johnson. In 1995 they joined Dumbledore's Army and Lee helped the twins harass Dolores Umbridge, one incident of which resulted in him being punished by "writing lines", scarring his hand. In the 1997–1998 school year, during the height of the Second Wizarding War, Fred was a guest on Potter Watch, the resistance radio show Lee hosted. In May of 1998, Lee returned with Fred and George to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts.

Filius Flitwick
Filius Flitwick, his former professor
Fred and George had a good relationship with many Hogwarts professors. Professor Filius Flitwick, the Charms professor and Head of Ravenclaw House, seemed to like them and he was very happy with their spell work. He also thought that they were very talented wizards and supported them in rebelling against Dolores Umbridge in 1995. When Fred and George set off fireworks around the grounds she spent a day running around putting them out. After she had finished inspecting Flitwick's classroom, he told her that he could have put them all out easily, but was concerned he didn't have the authority to do so.

After Easter break, the twins used one of their inventions, a Portable Swamp to change a corridor and several courtyards into swamps, shortly afterwards they departed from school to go into the world of business. Flitwick was seen cheering and supporting them at their departure after they circled around Umbridge and Filch. Flitwick was asked to remove the swamp they created, which he did but left a small patch in the corner as he believed it to be really good magic.

Rubeus Hagrid
Rubeus Hagrid, his former professor
Fred and George were friends of Rubeus Hagrid, the Care of Magical Creatures professor, throughout their time at Hogwarts. Hagrid seemed to be one of their favourite members of the staff, as he was not too serious and very tolerant, as many other professors were viewed as. They were also among the few people who still believed that Hagrid was a great person, even after they learned that he was a half-giant. Hagrid thought that Fred and George were trouble-makers, but still very funny.

He once compared them with James Potter and Sirius Black. Furthermore, they were all among Harry Potter's closest friends. Fred and George fought in the Second Wizarding War along with Hagrid. However, during the Battle of Hogwarts, he, George, and Hagrid split up. Fred, meanwhile, met up with his older brother, Percy, and together they duelled Pius Thicknesse. However, Fred was killed in the explosion soon afterward.

Albus Dumbledore
Albus Dumbledore, his former headmaster
Both Fred and George appeared to respect the headmaster Albus Dumbledore. They, like many others, thought that he was the greatest wizard of all time. He seemed to like them as well, despite the fact that they did stir up trouble; He knew they were good people at heart.

Along with George, Fred joined the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation founded by Dumbledore, in order to oppose Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. They also joined Dumbledore's Army, in 1995, an army founded and led by Harry to oppose the Ministry's interference.

Argus Filch
Argus Filch and Mrs Norris
The twins also disliked Argus Filch, the caretaker. Filch had punished them many times during their Hogwarts years, because they were trouble-makers. Fred also "nicked" the Marauder's Map from Filch, while he and George were in trouble in his office. Filch had a great knowledge of all Hogwarts' secret passageways, only beaten by Fred and George's. When Dolores Umbridge was appointed at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Filch supported her, and tried to punish the twins again. However, Fred and George escaped Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, flying with their broomsticks.

Severus Snape
Severus Snape, his former professor
Fred and George disliked Severus Snape the potions master. Snape disliked them, too. This could be because of the fact that the Weasley twins were trouble-makers, like Snape's schoolboy rivals the Marauders, especially James Potter I and Sirius Black. Snape was eventually charged with being Death Eater; however, he was a double agent and working for the Order of the Phoenix. He accidentally hit George with a Sectumsempra spell, while aiming at a Death Eater during the Battle of the Seven Potters. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Fred never learned that Snape was on the Order's side due to the former's death.

Dolores Umbridge
Fred and George hated Dolores Umbridge with a passion, who was appointed by the Ministry of Magic as the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor in 1995. Umbridge was a sadistic woman who enjoyed punishing and torturing students. Almost every resident of Hogwarts at the time hated Umbridge, but she particularly hated Harry Potter, Fred, and George. When George and Harry attacked Draco Malfoy, Umbridge kicked them off the team, along with Fred. They also created a Portable Swamp, in order to anger Umbridge. When she attempted to punish them, Fred and George insulted her in front of the whole school and then fled with their broomsticks.

Dumbledore's Army
Dumbledore's Army, his allies
In 1995, Fred and George joined Dumbledore's Army, an organisation founded and led by Harry Potter, in order to oppose Dolores Umbridge and teach Defence Against the Dark Arts to the other students. The twins knew most of them, and they had a good relationship with most members of the army, including Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Lee and Angelina.

Some members of the army were also members of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, including Alicia Spinnet and Katie Bell. The girls appeared to be close with Fred, whom they possibly knew since their first year, as well as George. Both of them were very upset when Umbridge kicked Harry and the twins off the team. Fred met them again when they fought at the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998.

Other members of the army were Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood, Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan, Lavender Brown, Parvati and Padma Patil, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Susan Bones, Cho Chang, Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, Terry Boot, Marietta Edgecombe and Zacharias Smith. Fred was friendly with them, although not very close; however, he disliked Zacharias Smith, who didn't believe that Voldemort had returned, and did not fight at the Battle of Hogwarts, as did Marietta Edgecombe, who betrayed the army to Umbridge. However, the rest of them fought for Dumbledore's Army, and at least two of them, Colin Creevey and Lavender Brown were killed by Death Eaters.

The Marauders
James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew
Fred and his brother George regarded the Marauders with a kind of idolatry and they believed that they owed a lot to them, as their invention, the Marauder's Map, helped them to achieve a lot of their aims. Although they owned the map for many years, they did not refer to them as the Marauders, but instead they called them by their nicknames: Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.

While they were in possession of the map, the twins did not, however, work out that two of the Marauders were two of their friends in the Order of the Phoenix: Remus Lupin and Sirius Black. Neither were they aware that Prongs was in fact Harry's father, James, and that Wormtail was actually Death Eater Peter Pettigrew.

He and George were both friends of Sirius Black. Sirius was friendly with them, but he argued with the twins (for example: when he told them to wait at home while their father was in danger). Sirius was killed by Bellatrix Lestrange during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996. The twins were saddened by his death, but tried not to remind Harry about it.

They were also friends of Remus Lupin, whom they first met in 1993, when he was Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. They considered him among the best teachers of this lesson they had ever had. Lupin fought with the twins in many battles of the Second War, and was killed in the final battle, along with Fred. Their bodies were put near each other's in the Great Hall.

It is unknown if the twins ever learnt the true identities of the Marauders, although it is possible they did eventually learn the truth after Voldemort's return considering that Sirius mentioned Pettigrew's nickname Wormtail in front of them while explaining Voldemort's intentions to them without them questioning that. It is also unknown if Lupin and Sirius ever learnt that the twins both had the Marauders Map in their possession during their time in Hogwarts.

Order of the Phoenix
The original Order of the Phoenix, his alias
Fred also became a member of the Order of the Phoenix during the Second Wizarding War. The Order was an organisation led by Albus Dumbledore in order to fight Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Fred had a good relationship with most members of the order. Some notable relationships include Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, his other family members (excluding Percy who had fallen out with the other Weasleys, and Ginny who was underage) and some of the Hogwarts professors.

Another member of the Order that they knew was Nymphadora Tonks. Tonks and the twins were close in age, and they were friendly. They fought together in the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts. Tonks was killed during the battle, too. Her body was put near Fred's, as well as Lupin's, after their death.

The twins also knew Alastor Moody and Kingsley Shacklebolt. They appeared to have a good relationship, although they were not very close. When Moody was killed by Voldemort, everyone was sad. When the twins learned about it, they were joking with each other. They immediately stopped talking, and their expressions immediately switched to sadness. Kingsley survived the war and became Minister for Magic.

Etymology
The name Fred is generally considered a short form of the name Frederick.[27] Alfred, and Wilfred, along with now being a name in its own right[1]. Frederick is the English form of a Germanic name meaning "peaceful ruler," derived from frid, "peace," and ric, "ruler, power." It has been a very common name for rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, Germany, Austria, and Scandinavia, such as Frederick the Great of Prussia.[28] Fred is also sometimes used as a diminutive of Alfred, derived from the Old English Ælfræd, meaning "elf counsel," or Alfrid, meaning "old peace." Alfred the Great was a ninth-century king of Wessex who battled the Danes and translated many Latin books into Old English.[29] In Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish, Fred means "peace."

There has been some suggestion that Fred and George are named after their maternal uncles, Fabian and Gideon Prewett, who were killed in the First Wizarding War, who may have been twins, and who share Fred and George's first initials.

Another possible significance of the twins' names is that George III became king because of the early death of Frederick, Prince of Wales. George III was also deaf in one ear. J. K. Rowling has stated that she chose the name for liking and and finding it fitting  with the "old-fashioned" theme of the other Weasley brothers.[30]

Behind the scenes

Fred Weasley as seen in Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells
Fred is portrayed by British actor James Phelps in all eight Harry Potter film adaptations and so is one of the 14 characters to appear in all of the films.
In the films, Fred and George are nearly always seen side-by-side. For the viewer to distinguish between Fred and George, actor James Phelps(Fred) is always placed on the left side of the screen and Oliver Phelps(George) is always placed on the right side of the screen, similar to how they are called "Fred and George".
He and George may have been the basis for Kaoru and Hikaru Hitachiin from the shoujo manga, "Ouran High School Host Club". They are both a pair of red-haired, mischievous twins.
Daniel Radcliffe plays Fred in the "Seven Potters" scene in his capacity as a decoy Harry.
Fred's last words were: "You actually are joking, Perce — I don't think I've heard you joke since you were —"
In the games, they used to own a shop in a deserted bathroom in Hogwarts, where they sold Wizard Cards, Chocolate Frogs, Cauldron Cakes and other magical items.
Fred and George each earned fewer O.W.L.s than the rest of their brothers.
Fred and George were the only sons of Arthur and Molly Weasley who did not become prefects during their education at Hogwarts.
When Harry Potter and his friends lost 150 House points in 1992, he lost favour with the Gryffindor Quidditch team. While understandable, it seems odd that Fred and George turned on him.
In the novels, the twins are described as being "shorter and stockier" and Percy and Ron as "long and lanky," but in the films, Fred and George are taller and leaner than both Percy and Ron.
In her drawing of the Weasley family tree, J. K. Rowling put the year of Fred's death down as 1997.[31] In canon, he actually died in May 1998.
His name was Bellatrix Lestrange's last word, in the variation of "Freddie." In the last film this line was cut out and instead it is George who calls Fred "Freddie" when asking if he was ready for battle. 
Despite the fact that they only earned three O.W.L.s each, in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Fred mentioned that he was transfiguring a raccoon in Transfiguration. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, George said that he might be able to sell a "few Extendable ears before Herbology" and Lee Jordan said that Fred and George played Exploding Snap during Defence Against the Dark Arts, and that they had an inspected Charms lesson.
Fittingly, Fred and George are born on April Fools' Day.
Fred and George might be named in honour of their mother's brothers Fabian and Gideon, as Fred and Fabian begin with the letter "F", and George and Gideon begin with the letter "G".
The only times Fred or George have been injured were when they were apart. They were split up at the time of Fred's death and when George lost his ear.
In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, it appears as though Fred is killed by a Death Eater as the last moment seen of Fred is him scrambling on the floor with a Death Eater standing over him just as both start to cast a spell. However, due to the brevity of the scene, it escapes most people that the twin in this scene is George, not Fred. The twin in this scene is wearing a purple jacket, which is what George wears during the Battle of Hogwarts; Fred's jacket is green. Furthermore, the ear is also a clue, as it is mangled and has no earlobe. Fred's death is not seen on-screen much to the dismay of fans. It is not on the DVD version, or in the deleted scenes.
The only time Fred saw George as old men, was when they put their names into the Goblet of Fire.
Oliver Phelps, who plays George, stated that it was quite upsetting for him to watch his real-life twin brother, James, act as if he were dead as Fred in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.
James Phelps admitted that when he was playing a dead Fred, he was actually asleep and the entire cast and crew went off to lunch without him, leaving him sleeping in the Great Hall set.
Author's comments
J. K. Rowling has commented that she always knew Fred was going to be killed in the series, though she guessed that readers would have expected George to die first, since he was the "gentler" of the two: "Fred is normally the funnier but also the crueller of the two. So they might have thought that George would be the more vulnerable one and, therefore, the one to die... Either one of them would have been terrible to kill. It was awful killing Fred. I hated that."[21] She also described Fred and George as "the risk-takers in the family... who just take a totally different life path and were prepared to risk everything".[32]

Rowling has also stated that Fred and George are among her favourite characters.[33]
