Biography
Early life
Grim Fawley was born somewhere in the British Isles during the mid-1980s[1] into the wizarding Fawley family. The Fawleys were one of the "Sacred Twenty-Eight", a number of families that were judged to be still "truly pure-blood" by the anonymous author of the Pure-Blood Directory in the 1930s.[7] His parents, Marshall and Lucretia Fawley, were loving and took good care of him.[8]

At the age of eleven, Grim received an acceptance letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. At some point before he boarded the Hogwarts Express, he travelled to Diagon Alley to buy school supplies: he was able to recall this in vivid detail even as an adult, suggesting he thought it a very good day.[9]

Hogwarts years (1996-2003)
Grim Fawley started at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on 1 September 1996, and was Sorted into Hufflepuff House.[10] His early years at Hogwarts coincided with the height of the Second Wizarding War: the end of his first year was marked by the infiltration of the school by a group of Death Eaters and the killing of the Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore; during his his second year, following the fall of the Ministry of Magic, the school headed by Severus Snape, and the students were left largely at the mercy of his sadistic deputies, Death Eaters Amycus and Alecto Carrow. The Battle of Hogwarts, which put an end to the war, broke out at the end of that school year: Grim was evacuated with the rest of the students who were not of age through a secret passage to Hogsmeade.[8]

Grim lost both of his parents to Death Eaters at some point during his first or second year at Hogwarts; their remains were cremated and their ashes kept in a porcelain urn that he held onto until adulthood.[8] From that point on, Grim spent the rest of his childhood in the care of orphanages, and rarely spoke about it in later years.[11]

Grim returned to Hogwarts to complete his education; in spite of the great personal tragedy, Grim remained an outstanding student and Headmistress Minerva McGonagall would later go on to describe him as "A Hufflepuff through and through",[10] meaning he embodied all of the qualities that marked his House, such as hard work, dedication and loyalty. With no family to go home to, however, would often stay at the school over the Christmas holidays, and spent many a bittersweet yule-day in Hogwarts Castle with just the portraits and ghosts for company. Even so, he still visibly retained some of the Christmas spirit, and always made sure a present was waiting under the tree for the often neglected caretaker, Argus Filch, and his cat Mrs Norris.[12]

Grim finished his education in 2003 with an impressive academic record, having earned five Outstandings and one Exceeds Expectations on his six N.E.W.T.s, and a "glowing recommendation" from Minerva McGonagall herself.[10]

Working for Ministry
Early career
An accomplished wizard, Grim Fawley joined the Ministry of Magic following his graduation from Hogwarts, having been hired by the Ministry's research wing, he was assigned to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.[10] Landing a desk job as a research assistant at the Auror Office, Grim was tasked with compiling and fact-checking evidence for the Investigation Department; a difficult job, but nevertheless one at which he was rather good.[13] While generally quiet and shy around many of his new peers to begin with, Grim was soon recognised for having both "a wit about him",[14] as well as for displaying "a wicked sense oh humour" around those he was friendly with,[15] A gifted employee, Grim would go on to work alongside many notable Aurors over the course of his career, such as Battle of Hogwarts veteran Ronald Weasley, with whom he was partnered for some time when he first joined the department,[11] and Mordecai Berrycloth. In time, Grim would go on to get along very well with most of his co-workers, earning the respect and gaining the friendship of many of his fellow Ministry officials.

Ultimately recognised for having played an important role in the apprehension and capture of a number of dangerous Dark Wizards,[16] he was eventually promoted to Head research assistant.[17] It was in this capacity that Grim found himself in frequent contact with was his future wife, Penelope Padgett. A highly gifted witch and an efficient employee, she had accomplished much in her work at the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, which ultimately led no less a person than Harry Potter himself, the Head of the Auror Office, to offer her a job in his department, which she accepted.[18] As the daughter of two staunch followers of Lord Voldemort,[19] there were those, such as Gethsemane Prickle, that remained suspicious of her, and thought that she might have had ulterior motives for agreeing to the transfer.[20] Nevertheless judged to be fully qualified for the job, she impressed her new colleagues by qualifying as a fully-fledged Auror a full year earlier than most of her new colleagues had. Subsequently deemed by Harry Potter to be one of the best and brightest Aurors in the Ministry's employ,[21] she was eventually put in charge of one of their ongoing investigations, and it was during this instance that Grim and Penelope first began working together.[22]

More open-minded than many of his associates, however, Grim did not judge Penelope based on the chosen allegiance of her parents; and instead dutifully accepted the task of helping her to work a case she had been put in charge of.[17] Over the course of the investigation, the two of them eventually grew close, with the pair eventually falling in love while solving crimes together. Worried that their superiors would find their newfound infatuation inappropriate and transfer him to another department, however, the couple was very private about their relationship to begin with; until finally Grim admitted the truth during a Christmas party to a friend and co-worker by the name of Constance Pickering.[23] While the revelation of their workplace romance was later described as "a bit scandalous", rather than taking an issue with two colleagues dating, however, the reactions they received from their associates turned out to be one of surprise, as many of them thought the couple to be an odd fit.[23] Now free to continue seeing each other openly, however, Grim and Penelope eventually married one another, their wedding taking place in in West Bromwich in June of 2006.[24] At some point not too long after, the had a pair of fraternal twins,[24] naming them Melody and Addison.[14]

Promotion
Having long grown weary of always being sidelined and having to look in on the adventures of those around him, not to mention with being stuck with a job that was,   whilst described by among others Harry Potter as being very difficult,[25] still far below his level of ability and thus left him increasingly unsatisfied. And despite his own initial beliefs to the contrary, it did not take long for his wife to finally convince him that he was indeed cut out for bigger things.[26]  Around the same time, Grim  got hold of an ancient tome; the content of which no one thus far had been up to the task of elucidating. Not only did Grim succeeded where others had failed, however, but he even made it seem easy; and left several handwritten notes detailing his process tucked into the book. Upon learning this, Sage Bragnam, the Head Curator of the Department of Magical Artefacts, tried to have him transferred to his department, only to learn that Grim's wife had already successfully persuaded him to try his hand as an Unspeakable in the Department of Mysteries.[22] Although Gareth Greengrass, a high-ranking researcher of said department whom his wife were friendly with, was initially dumbfounded at the prospect of having Grim as a colleague when Penelope first told him that he was considering to apply for a job there, he quickly warmed up to to the idea when it occurred to him that the man was not only fully qualified, but also undeniably a very accomplished wizard, to the point where Greengrass himself would later remark that Grim had "more magical talent in his little finger than most of us do in our whole bodies."[22]

And so, when Grim finally applied for the job, Mr. Greengrass was completely on board with it.[27] His colleague, on the other hand, Albert Sallow, was against the appointment; judging him to be too young, too inexperienced, and that he lacked the passion necessary to be an asset to the team.[28] In the end, it took a letter of recommendation from Greengrass himself, co-signed by the well-respected Auror Mordecai Berrycloth, to get Grim approved accepted for a trial period within the department. While there were some rumours going around that Gareth Greengrass were showing favouritism to Grim because of his friendship with Grim's wife, the effort it took to prove his salt, which included an excellent aptitude for secrecy and considerable amount of magical acumen, Grim's achievement alone. and within a year, even Mr. Sallow had to admit, despite of his previous doubts about his commitment to the role, that Grim has surpassed all expectations during his trial period; which ultimately lead Greengrass to dispatch a interdepartmental memo announcing Grim's promotion.[29] Following this, Grim Fawley received a new Ministry Identification Card, featuring a photograph and credentials listing as an Unspeakable, with clearance for the Department of Mysteries, and a key to access it.[29]

Around the same time, the department would have a “breakthrough”[30], though whether the breakthrough was responsible for his promotion is unknown.

At some point during his tenure, Grim rescued Eric Munch in the Department of Mysteries' Brain Room.[31]

The "London Five" incident
Some time later, Grim was horrified to learn that his wife was counted among a group of five people who gone mysteriously missing in London, along with Riya Patel, Timothy Hale, Kit Gerrard, and Genevieve Bladt - a case that would be referred to as “The London Five”.[32] Soon after, Gareth Greengrass, a high-ranking official in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, assured Grim that he would “do everything in [his] power" and "save no expense" to find his wife. Considering one of the missing individuals were one of his own subordinates, Harry Potter, was in charge of the investigation. Despite their best efforts, however, the Aurors met a dead end in the London Five investigation,[33] and thus, the council on which Gareth Greengrass and his colleagues presided over the investigation decided to close the case, leaving the families of the missing distraught. Worse still, part of the reason given for the decision was that the costs of the investigation exceeded the amount that the Aurors could afford to spend.

Soon thereafter, Grim sent a memo to Greengrass, pleading with him to convince the council to re-open the investigation. To make matters worse, not only had Greengrass deemed it to dismiss it as a bad job, he also implied that he was convinced that Penelope was most likely dead, throwing Grim further into a state of despair. Although Greengrass advised him to take time off work "to grieve and look after his children", having gone so far as to even admit that he had already gone over Grim's head and proposed it to Grim’s superiors behind his back, Mr Fawely refused to take the alleged demise of his beloved Nel on face value and resolved to take matters into his own hands[34]. Not long afterwards, he turned to Harry Potter instead, imploring him to 'bend the rules',[35] and continue the search off the records, for Penelope's sake. Soon thereafter, he tried to retrieve his wife's file in order to learn exactly what she had been doing at the time of her disappearance, only to be denied access to it due to the confidentiality of much of its information. This lead him to write an angry message to Mr Potter, insisting that he had a right to access to it, accusing him of showing blatant disregard for his own subordinates and tried to make him change his mind by claiming that he was actively "barring a grieving husband from the closure he deserves", implying he was pretending to have accepted Greengrass's conclusion as a way of appealing to Harry's emotion to try and convince him, once more, to bend the rules[36].

At some point later, he stole investigation files regarding the investigation into the disappearance of the London Five, where he discovered that the cited reason given for closing the case, namely the strain of the budget, did not correlate with the actual costs of the investigation, prompting him to issue a complaint to the Ministry's Accounting Department and demand an explanation for the inaccuracy in their financial records. Around the same time, Mr Fawley received a letter from a witch by the name of Amorette Deneuve, in which she expressed the belief that Love was "the greatest and most dangerous magic in the world", describing it something that "imbues itself into our very bones, our very souls." This lead Grim Fawely to believe that the power of love might just be the key to find his wife. At a later date, during the investigation into the Calamity, of which Grim was eventually strongly suspected of having caused[35][37] and whose whereabouts became unknown to the Ministry around the same time, it was revealed by the log documenting the time of her entry and exit of the Love Chamber that Grim had been coming and going at odd times.

The Calamity
Around the time shortly prior to outbreak of the aforementioned threat to the International Confederation of Wizards' Statute of Secrecy, Grim was known have begun acting rather suspiciously. This was shown when the British Ministry suddenly received an unexpected, written objection complaint from their Japanese counterpart, asking for an explanation as to why one of their employees had written to them and requested classified documents from their archives without going through the proper channels, demanding that they have Grim provide them with a "detailed and polite explanation".[37]At some point later on, a wizarding library in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic reported that several ancient spell books had gone missing, with its librarian suspecting a recent visitor of being the culprit.[38] This was presumably tied to Fawley's search for his wife.
