Molly Weasley (née Prewett) (b. 30 October, 1949 or 1950) was an English pure-blood witch and matriarch of the Weasley family after marrying Arthur Weasley. She was born into the Prewett family and was sister to Fabian and Gideon Prewett, members of the original Order of the Phoenix. 

Molly attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. Sometime after she graduated, both her brothers were murdered by Death Eaters in the First Wizarding War. Molly and Arthur ended up having seven children, consisting of six sons named Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George and Ron and only one daughter named Ginny Weasley. She also played a large part in the life of Harry Potter, acting as a motherly figure towards him. 

Molly was a member of the revived Order of the Phoenix following the return of Lord Voldemort and participated in the final battle of the Second Wizarding War. Her actions during this battle caused her to be known as the witch that defeated and killed the notorious Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange.

Molly survived the final battle to see her family expand even further, with twelve grandchildren by 2017. Percy and his wife named their eldest daughter in honour of her.

Biography
Early life
Molly was born on 30 October in 1949 or 1950 to Mr and Mrs Prewett. She had two brothers: Gideon and Fabian. Molly began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the early 1960s and was sorted into Gryffindor House. She once said that in her youth she brewed a Love Potion.

It was Hogwarts where Molly met Arthur Weasley, whom she began dating. One night, they went out for a night-time stroll and whilst Arthur got caught by Apollyon Pringle, she managed to get back to Gryffindor Tower at four in the morning and was told off by the Fat Lady.

First Wizarding War
The Burrow, where Molly and Arthur raised their family
Molly graduated from Hogwarts in the late 1960s. She and Arthur wed soon after. The family lived at The Burrow on the outskirts of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon. Molly and Arthur's first child, William, was born 29 November, 1970. More children followed: Charlie, Percy, and twins Fred and George. After having her first five sons, she longed to have a daughter but had another son, Ronald, before finally having a daughter, Ginevra.

During the First Wizarding War, Molly wasn't mentioned as a member of the Order of the Phoenix, something that was confirmed by Remus Lupin. This is likely because she was having and taking care of many young children at the time. However, her brothers were members of the Order, but were murdered during the war by five Death Eaters in 1981, including Antonin Dolohov, who was subsequently imprisoned in Azkaban for the crime. Given the way she speaks about Gideon and Fabian, Molly was distraught at their deaths and may have inherited their things, as was seen by her keeping Fabian's watch for several years.

In 1987, Fred burnt a hole in Ron's tongue by feeding him an Acid Pop. This made Molly outraged enough to wallop the former with her broomstick.

Between the wars
By 1991, all her children from Bill to Fred and George had been accepted to Hogwarts and Sorted into Gryffindor House, and Ron's first year at Hogwarts was to begin. Molly and Ginny accompanied Percy, Fred, George, and Ron to King's Cross Station, although her daughter was too young to begin school herself. After Percy, Fred, and George got onto Platform 9¾, another young boy approached her and politely asked how to get onto the Platform. She kindly gave him instructions, and told him to go ahead before Ron.

Molly, Ginny, Ron, and Harry Potter meet for the first time at King's Cross Station
After getting onto the platform with Ginny, Molly learned that the boy she had just talked to was Harry. When Fred and George wondered if he remembered what Lord Voldemort looked like, she became stern and forbade them from asking him. When last calls for the train came, Molly ushered her children onto the train and called for them to have a good term. She addressed the twins, telling them that she didn't want to receive any more owls that they had blown up a toilet, and George quipped that they would send her a Hogwarts lavatory seat.

Having become friends with Harry, Ron contacted Molly shortly before the Christmas holidays to tell her that Harry wasn't expecting any presents. She came to the rescue, knitting him an emerald green Weasley jumper and making him a box of home-made fudge. For the Christmas holidays, Molly, Ginny, and Arthur also went to Romania to visit their son Charlie.

When Harry and the others returned from Hogwarts for the summer, he thanked Molly for the jumper and fudge, to which she insisted it was no trouble. When Harry's uncle Vernon barked at him to get moving, she tried to engage him in conversation, which ended up going nowhere.

Summer of 1992
Molly serving her family and Harry Potter breakfast after they stole the Ford Anglia
One night, Molly was scared to death when she found Fred, George, and Ron's beds empty, the family car gone, and no note left behind explaining what the boys were doing. When the trio returned with Harry the next morning, having flown to Surrey and back, her anger exploded and she yelled at them for what, to Harry, seemed like hours. She didn't blame Harry, but threw her sons nasty looks the whole time she made breakfast. To punish them, Molly made them de-gnome the back garden. When she looked up the process in Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide to Household Pests, Fred implied that his mother had a crush on Lockhart. While she said the thought was ridiculous, her body language told another story — she beamed at his picture and blushed slightly.

The Weasley family and Harry Potter travelling to Diagon Alley
About a week after Harry arrived at the Burrow, Molly and Arthur took the family and Harry to Diagon Alley to buy their school supplies. Before leaving, she and Arthur learned that Harry had never travelled through the Floo Network before. After Harry got lost in Knockturn Alley, she was relieved to find him safe with Hagrid, being grateful to the half-giant for finding him. After getting their money from Gringotts, Molly departed with Ginny to a second-hand robe shop, to meet the others an hour later at Flourish and Blotts. After Arthur got into a fist fight with Lucius Malfoy, she was livid, claiming that his actions were a bad example to set for their children.

Second opening of the Chamber of Secrets
Molly's Howler to Ron
After dropping the children off at King's Cross Station on 1 September, Molly and Arthur were outraged when they found their car gone. That night, she received a letter from the head of Gryffindor Minerva McGonagall explaining what Harry and Ron had done. The next day, she sent a Howler to Ron, expressing her absolute disgust at his reckless behaviour and the fact that Arthur was now facing an inquiry at work.

In the spring of 1993, Molly and Arthur arrived at Hogwarts, who were extremely worried after learning that the Monster of Slytherin had taken Ginny into the Chamber of Secrets. When Harry and Ron brought her back safely, she was grateful to Harry and curious as to how he managed it. After Harry explained everything, she accompanied Ginny to the hospital wing.

Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban
The Weasley family in Egypt
That summer, Arthur won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw. He and Molly decided to spend the gold on a trip to Egypt to visit Bill. While Bill took them on tours of the pyramids, she refused to let Ginny come into the last one, which was full of "mutant skeletons" of Muggles who had broken in and "grown extra heads." After returning about a week before the new school year, Molly learnt from Arthur that Sirius Black had escaped from Azkaban Prison and that his target was supposedly Harry, as Sirius was muttering "he's at Hogwarts" in his sleep. She also heard from Arthur that the former prisoner intended to murder Harry.

Molly preparing her family for a trip to Diagon Alley
After meeting Harry in Diagon Alley on 31 August, Molly discussed Black's connection to Harry with Arthur, who wanted to tell Harry the truth about why Black was supposed to be after him. She didn't want to send Harry to school with that hanging over his head, while being convinced that he would be perfectly safe from harm since Dumbledore was stationed at Hogwarts. Arthur then countered that if Black could break out of Azkaban, then he was capable of breaking in to Hogwarts. The next day, Molly and Arthur saw Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the others off to school. The following June, she arrived at King's Cross to pick her family up.

Reappearance of the Dark Mark
In August, Molly sent a letter to the Dursleys by the Muggle postman, "asking" permission to take Harry to the Quidditch World Cup, though the Weasleys were planning to collect Harry whether the Dursleys said yes or not. Unsure of how much postage to include, she completely covered the envelope with stamps, leaving only a square inch on the front in which she managed to squeeze the Dursleys' address.

Molly's children, Harry Potter, and Hermione Granger in the garden of the Burrow
When she entered the family's kitchen, Molly caught Arthur in the middle of scolding Fred and George for something. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny disappeared upstairs while Arthur was forced to tell her about the Ton-Tongue Toffee the twins had pulled on Harry's cousin Dudley. After she stopped yelling at them, she began preparing dinner, during which she huffed about George and Fred's trouble-making.

On the morning of the Quidditch World Cup, Molly caught Fred and George trying to smuggle Ton-Tongue Toffees out of the house, in unusual places like the lining of George's jacket and the turn-ups of Fred's jeans. When she read about the Death Eaters' attack on the World Cup grounds, Molly became worried for her family. When the family arrived safely back home, she hugged Fred and George, crying over the thought of the fact that if they had died, the last thing she spoke to them about would be that she yelled at them for not having earned more O.W.L.s.

Triwizard Tournament
Molly seeing of her children, Harry, and Hermione off to Hogwarts
On 1 September, Molly, Bill, and Charlie accompanied the trio to King's Cross Station for the return to Hogwarts, wishing all of them a happy term and gave hugs goodbye. The three of them all implied that something special was happening at the school, but wouldn't elaborate. This left the trio and others highly curious as to what it could possibly be, but they didn't find out until the term started what the surprise was.

According to Charlie, when Harry's name came out of the Goblet of Fire as a surprise fourth champion, Molly was against letting him compete, believing that Harry was too young. She was "in floods" after reading an "interview" with Rita Skeeter in which Skeeter claimed Harry still cried about his parents, and she happened to believe every word that Rita Skeeter penned. Considering his mother's already fragile state, Charlie didn't have the heart to tell her what Harry had to do for the First Task.

Molly was horrified when Skeeter reported that Hermione Granger was messing with Harry. As a result, on Easter she sent Hermione chicken-sized Easter eggs containing homemade toffee, whereas the ones she sent to Harry and Ron were the size of dragon eggs.

Molly among the people watching the third task of the tournament
In June, Molly arrived at Hogwarts with Bill to watch Harry in the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament, in place of his family. While whittling down the hours until the task started, Harry gave her and Bill a tour around the grounds, showing them the Beauxbatons carriage and the Durmstrang ship. Molly was intrigued by the Whomping Willow, which had been planted after she left school. She also reminisced about Ogg, the gamekeeper before Hagrid.

When the trio returned to the castle for lunch, Ron was surprised to see his mother and eldest brother there. Fred, George, and Ginny came over to join them, something which Harry enjoyed. When Hermione appeared at the table, having come from the library, she greeted her more stiffly than usual, as Skeeter had been writing articles about the prodigy student supposedly toying with Harry and Viktor Krum's affections. After Harry explained that the stories were false and that he and Hermione had never been romantically involved, she warmed up to her son's friend once again. Molly later defended Harry with a fierce passion against Amos Diggory's accusations of not correcting Rita Skeeter in her original article about Harry, which was supposed to be about the Triwizard Tournament.

Snape uses his Dark Mark as proof that Voldemort has returned
After Harry returned from Little Hangleton with Cedric Diggory's dead body, Molly, the other Weasleys, and Hermione stayed with him in the hospital wing. When Dumbledore acted to reactivate the Order of the Phoenix, Molly was shocked to learn Sirius Black was in the room, still believing Sirius to be a mass murderer like most of the wizarding world. However, Ron was able to convince her otherwise. Molly and the other members learnt about Lord Voldemort's return, which she believed Harry about. She also comforted Harry after his horrific experience in the Little Hangleton graveyard.

Second Wizarding War
A week into the summer holidays, Molly had her heart broken when Percy broke contact with the family after a row with his father. Percy insulted his parents, believing them to be "idiots" for following Dumbledore, and moved out to a flat in London. She went to London to try and talk with Percy, but he simply slammed the door in her face.

Living at 12 Grimmauld Place
Molly having a row with Sirius involving Harry's welfare
Molly and Arthur moved their family to 12 Grimmauld Place in London, the headquarters of the Order. Under Dumbledore's orders, the Weasleys kept Harry Potter in the dark about the Order's goings-on. When the Advance Guard delivered Harry to Grimmauld Place, she was pleased to see him, but quickly ushered him upstairs so he wouldn't interrupt the Order's meeting. When the meeting ended, Molly brought the children downstairs for dinner. Against her wishes, Sirius and Remus gave Harry the general picture of what the Order was doing in the fight against Voldemort, which lead to an intense row between Molly and Sirius involving Harry's welfare.

Molly with others in 12 Grimmauld Place preparing to clean
For the following weeks, Molly led the charge in making the house suitable for living in, which was not an easy task considering how long it had been without inhabitants or proper housekeeping. When Harry had to go to the Ministry for a hearing regarding his illegal use of under-age magic, Molly was among those who worried about the result. Like the rest of the family, she was relieved when Harry was cleared of all charges, although she did scold Fred, George, and Ginny for parading around chanting "He got off."

When Ron was made a Gryffindor prefect, Molly was overjoyed and offered to get him a reward, to which he asked for a new broom, but quickly added that it didn't need to be a good broom upon seeing his mother's face fall. She returned later that night with the children's school supplies and prepared a party to celebrate Ron and Hermione's appointments. When "Mad-Eye" Moody arrived, Molly asked him to look at what was in the writing desk in the drawing room. Using his "mad" eye, Moody confirmed it was a Boggart and offered to get rid of it, but she declined, commenting she would do it after dinner. After Harry witnessed her inability to vanquish it, she tearfully expressed her concern over her family's safety. Lupin comforted her, explaining that the Order had a better understanding of Voldemort than they did the first time, and that while he couldn't promise no one would get hurt, the Order would do their best to protect her family and Harry from the upcoming danger.

Molly escorting Harry Potter and her children to the Hogwarts Express
On the morning of 1 September, Fred and George again got on Molly's nerves when they bewitched their trunks to zoom down the stairs, to save the trouble of carrying them. The trunks managed to knock Ginny down two flights of stairs, to which her mother screamed at the pair that they could have seriously injured her. When Sirius came bounding downstairs in his dog form to see Harry off, Molly reiterated that it was a bad idea, but felt that it was up to him if he wanted to risk his safety.

When she got wind of the secret group Harry, Ron, and Hermione were planning to form in order to teach practical defensive magic, Molly was firmly against the idea, believing that they would all have time to learn to defend themselves after they left school. She asked Sirius to pass on a message to Ron, which was that he was in no way to continue the group. She also wanted the message passed on to Harry and Hermione, due to accepting that she had no control over the pair's actions, but having their best interests at heart.

St Mungo's Hospital
During the Christmas holiday, Molly was contacted by Dumbledore's phoenix Fawkes to warn her that Arthur had been attacked by Nagini while doing guard duty for the Order. While the Weasley children stayed with Sirius in Grimmauld Place, they wanted to set off for St Mungo's at once. In response, Sirius had to convince them they couldn't until their mother had been notified, as it would look too suspicious otherwise. This caused issues with Fred and George whom wanted to see their father immediately. Before setting off for St Mungo's, Molly sent a note to Grimmauld Place, which stated that Arthur was still alive and warned them to stay put. At 5:10 a.m. she arrived at Grimmauld Place to tell them Arthur would be all right and that they could all visit him later, making George and Ginny very relieved before they got up and hugged her. When Sirius began making breakfast, Molly hugged Harry and expressed her gratitude that if not for him Arthur might have died. She proceeded to tell Sirius to go and relax and that she would take over breakfast. 

Molly with Arthur after he was attacked by Nagini during Christmas holidays
When the Weasleys and Harry visited Arthur in St Mungo's, Molly became alarmed when Arthur mentioned one of his room-mates was a werewolf, but he calmed her by pointing out the full moon wasn't for another fortnight. When the twins tried to get information from Arthur about what he had been doing, she got angry and told them that the topic wasn't up for discussion. Molly later fretted over Harry's supposed illness when he was acting strangely after their visit. In fact, Harry was concerned and scared for the well-being of others because he thought he might have been possessed by Lord Voldemort, but she did not know this.

On Christmas Day, Molly's concern about Percy reached a breaking point when he returned his Christmas jumper unopened. Fred and George "attempted" to console her, but soon afterwards Lupin took over. When the family and Harry returned to visit Arthur again, Molly exploded after learning that for his wound, Arthur had tried using stitches, a Muggle remedy for similar Muggle wounds.

Start of open warfare
Molly greeting Harry in the Burrow's kitchen during the summer holiday
In June, Molly and Arthur arrived at King's Cross Station to pick their children up. The couple also made plans with Dumbledore to take Harry to The Burrow two weeks into the summer holidays, so he wouldn't have to spend the whole summer with the Dursleys, probably guessing that Harry didn't want to spend his entire summer holidays grieving his godfather's death at Privet Drive alone, with only his negative thoughts and unpleasant relatives for company.

When Harry arrived in July, Molly revealed that Arthur had been promoted to head a new department for Rufus Scrimgeour. From the tone of her voice, Harry deduced she had been "bursting" to tell someone. She made him a bowl of onion soup and remarked on how much he had grown since she saw him last, stating that it looked as though he had a Stretching Jinx placed upon him. Molly and Harry then discussed Horace Slughorn and his return to Hogwarts. When Arthur arrived home from work, he made her ask him their security questions before allowing himself in, as to set an example and in the process revealed that Arthur's private nickname for her was "Mollywobbles."

Molly, Arthur, Remus, and Tonks at the Burrow
The next morning, Molly expressed her disdain at Bill's engagement to Fleur Delacour, whom was staying at the house as Bill had brought her to the Burrow so she could get to know his family better before the wedding. Molly had a low opinion of Fleur and disliked being alone with her, thinking that she was snobbish and rude. She also felt that the engagement was rushed and believed it was due to the fear brought on by Voldemort's return to power. According to Ginny, her mother kept trying to break up the engagement by inviting Nymphadora Tonks to dinner, hoping that Bill would fall for her instead.

When Hermione got a black eye from one of Fred and George's punching telescopes, she went to Molly to try and get rid of it to no avail; but she was unable to remove the bruise even with The Healer's Helpmate. When Ron's O.W.L. results arrived, Molly was pleased to learn he had earned seven "pass" grades, commenting that it was more than Fred and George both earned, put together. When the school book lists arrived, she refused to go to Diagon Alley without Arthur; when Ron made a joke about Voldemort possibly hiding in Flourish and Blotts, his mother threatened not only to leave him behind and get his things herself, but hold him back from returning to Hogwarts too, so Ron quickly recanted as he wanted to see Fred and George's shop.

Molly with the trio and Ginny in Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes
When the family and Hagrid arrived in Diagon Alley, Molly expressed her concern to stay together, while at the same time battling the desire to finish the shopping quickly. Hagrid assured her that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would be fine with him, so she, Arthur, and Ginny headed off towards Flourish and Blotts. When the group reunited, they headed off towards Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Approaching the store, Molly stared in horror at the advertisement for "U-No-Poo," an item they sold to help cause constipation. Once inside the store, Ginny asked her mother if she could buy a Pygmy Puff. At one point, she also caught Ron in the middle of making an extremely rude hand gesture at Fred and immediately threatened to jinx his fingers together if she saw him do it again.

On 1 September, Molly and Arthur ushered the children onto the train back to Hogwarts.

1996 Christmas holidays
Molly with her family during Christmas holiday
During the Christmas holidays, Molly had her hands full, as she entertained many quests that Christmas, some including Harry, Fleur, and Remus. She masked Percy's continued defection from the family by saying he was busy at the Ministry. When Rufus Scrimgeour brought Percy over in an excuse to speak to Harry, the others present tensed at the mention of Scrimgeour wanting to get Harry alone but Molly paid no regard to this, as her main focus was Percy, which was made evident by her overjoyingly crying tears of happiness and hugging her son. However, Percy had no intention of speaking with his family, so his mother was more devastated than ever when Percy stormed out after having mashed parsnips flung at his glasses by Fred, George, and Ginny. She continued to be upset well past Christmas, teary eyed and sobbing when she saw her children and Harry off to Hogwarts via the Floo, bidding them farewell and had them promise to try and be careful, which resulted in her being in slightly higher spirits by the end of the goodbyes.

In March, Molly and Arthur were called to the school when Ron accidentally drank some poisoned mead. Harry saved his life by the use of a bezoar, a small stone found in the stomach of a goat that acts as an antidote to most poisons. When the pair arrived in the hospital wing, she hugged Harry very tightly, pointing out how many of the family members he had saved. She was very happy that Ron was no longer in danger and would make a full recovery.

Aftermath of the Battle of the Astronomy Tower
The funeral of Albus Dumbledore that Molly attended along with her husband
Molly and Arthur returned to Hogwarts again in June after learning that Bill had been injured in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. While Arthur was interested in how Dumbledore had died, she only had her eyes on Bill. She commented that Bill had always been handsome and that he was "going" to be married, but Fleur took offence to this and shouted that she didn't care what Bill looked like, as her love for him ran deeper than physical appearance. Accepting that the pair truly did love each other, she offered Fleur her great-aunt Muriel's goblin-made tiara to wear at the wedding, and then the two women hugged, which was surprising as Molly had always disagreed with Fleur and Bill's relationship.

In June, Molly and Arthur attended Dumbledore's funeral along with Bill and Fleur. They were deeply saddened by the tragic death of the Headmaster of Hogwarts, who protected their family members and their comrades in the Order. At some point, Molly learned that Harry, Ron, and Hermione were planning to drop out of Hogwarts. When she approached them to find out why, they refused to divulge any information. While Arthur and Remus also approached the issue and dropped it when they were told it was a secret, she was determined to learn the truth.

Battle of the Seven Potters
Molly and Ginny relieved at the safe arrival of Harry and Hagrid
When Harry and Hagrid arrived at the Burrow after the Battle of the Seven Potters, Molly was relieved that they managed to arrive safely. She hurried from the inside of the Burrow and proceeded to pull Harry into a hug that he felt he didn't deserve. She was worried because a lot of the others had missed their portkeys and Harry and Hagrid were the first to arrive, even thought they were suppose to arrive third. Hagrid then asked if Molly had any brandy, for "medicinal purposes", as he was in pain from the battle. Instead of summoning it by magic, she went into the house to collect it herself. Harry knew that this was because she wanted to hide her worry and the blotchiness of her face.

Molly taking care of an injured George after he loses an ear
A few moments later, Ginny alerted Molly to the arrival of Lupin and George. Seeing there was obviously something wrong with her son, she soon learned that he was missing his left ear. Molly managed to staunch the bleeding, but was unable to repair the damage. However, she was simply relieved that he was alive. When Arthur and Fred returned safely, Molly cried harder than ever when George turned the injury into a punch line. George then commented that at least from then on, she would be able to differentiate the pair. A few minutes later, Ron and Bill both returned safely. Hugging his mother, Bill told the group that "Mad-Eye" Moody had been killed.

Wedding of Bill & Fleur and Aftermath
Molly prepares the Burrow for the arrival of the Delacours
Within a few days, Molly approached Harry under the pretence of determining the owner of a sock, about why he, Ron, and Hermione were planning to leave Hogwarts. Harry refused to say explicitly why, but dropped hints that it was because of something Dumbledore wanted him to do. She argued that she and Arthur deserved to know, and was sure Mr. and Mrs Granger would agree, continuing that Dumbledore had the whole Order at his command if he wanted something done and the three of them were hardly of age. Harry countered that there had been no misunderstanding: the mission Dumbledore left for him was for him alone, and Ron and Hermione were coming along by choice. Seeing she was fighting a losing battle, Molly the changed the subject by asking if he would help prepare the house for Bill and Fleur's wedding. He agreed, but she made sure to give the trio jobs that kept them away from each other, believing that she could delay their departure if she could prevent them from getting together and planning, as Ginny commented to Harry. When the Delacours arrived the following morning, Molly was somewhat flustered, but pleased to have them there. She and Arthur fervently insisted that Monsieur and Madame Delacour take their bedroom, while she and Arthur slept in the sitting room. 

Bill and Fleur's wedding
The following day, which was also Harry's birthday, Molly gave him a watch that had belonged to her late brother Fabian. In the middle of explaining the tradition of giving children a watch when they came of age, her speech was interrupted by a hug from Harry with which he hoped to convey his deep feelings of gratitude and care, which worked as she was taken-aback but very touched. When Charlie arrived that evening, she forced him into a chair at wandpoint and gave him a haircut. Molly then made a scrumptious dinner and made Harry's birthday cake into the shape of a Golden Snitch. Just before the cutting of the cake, she learned that Rufus Scrimgeour was accompanying Arthur home. After the pair arrived, Scrimgeour revealed the reason for his visit: he required a private word with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. 

Kingsley's Patronus warning the wedding attendees of the Ministry's fall
The next day was Bill's wedding to Fleur. Molly was once again in tears as Percy didn't show up. During the ceremony, she sat with Apolline Delacour and the pair cried into their tissues. At the reception that followed, she danced with Monsieur Delacour. Soon afterwards, Molly learned with everyone else that the Ministry of Magic had fallen to the Death Eaters' control and that Scrimgeour was dead, shortly before the reception was ransacked by arriving Death Eaters. After the Death Eaters left, she and Arthur sent word to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that the rest of the family was safe.

In March, the Death Eaters identified Ron as travelling with Harry Potter. Bill was able to get word to his family, and Molly and the rest of the Weasley family vacated the Burrow. They lived with her aunt Muriel during this time.

Battle of Hogwarts
Minerva McGonagall and Molly preparing for battle
On 2 May, 1998 Molly and Arthur arrived at the school to take part in the Battle of Hogwarts. Along with several other individuals, she cast protective charms over Hogwarts before the battle. As the combination of the Order and Dumbledore's Army left to gather in the Great Hall, she was adamant about Ginny going home since she was under-age. Ginny insisted she should be there in addition to the rest of her family and because she was a member of Dumbledore's Army. During this argument, Percy entered the room, having learned of the pending battle from Aberforth Dumbledore. He made peace with his family, much to her relief.


When the family left to join the others, Molly caught Ginny trying to sneak out with them. Lupin then proposed that Ginny could stay in the Room of Requirement; that way she could remain close to her family while simultaneously being out of harm's way. During a break in the battle, as ordered by Voldemort, Molly grieved Fred's death in the Great Hall. She laid across his chest and wept, while Arthur stroked her hair.

When the battle resumed, Molly witnessed Bellatrix Lestrange fire a Killing Curse at Ginny, who was fighting along with Hermione and Luna Lovegood. Distraught at the prospect of losing yet another child as well as her only daughter, she angrily charged right at the infamous Death Eater who at first was beside herself with laughter at the idea of Molly  attempting to fight her but soon became enraged as she bore witness to Molly's fierce assault. Both witches began to battle with such lethal ferocity that the "floor beneath them turned hot and cracked"  As Molly continued her attack, Bellatrix taunted her, asking what would happen to her children  when she died. Molly vowed that Bellatrix would never inflict harm on her family again and struck the arrogantly distracted Bellatrix with a deadly blow. In doing so, she avenged Frank and Alice Longbottom, Sirius Black, and Nymphadora Tonks, among countless others.   

Molly with her family after the Battle
The death of his "last, best lieutenant" made Voldemort turn his wand on Molly, but Harry shielded her and revealed himself to be alive. She and everyone else watched the interaction between Harry and Voldemort, which ended with Voldemort's final defeat and the end of the Second Wizarding War. Molly joined the other Weasleys in congratulating Harry. She was last seen sitting with Ginny (who had her head on her mother's shoulder) and her other family members at a table in the Great Hall.

Later life
In the years following Voldemort's death, Molly's family grew with the marriages of her children and births of numerous grandchildren. She also served as the namesake of Percy's oldest daughter.

Physical appearance
Molly was frequently described as a short, slightly plump, and kindly-looking woman. Like the rest of her immediate family, she had flaming fiery red hair and her eyes were the same shade of warm brown as her daughter's. Harry was shocked to see that she could so easily look "like a sabre-tooth tiger" when she was angry with her sons. 

Molly was described as "porky," by Draco Malfoy and "dumpy" by Vernon Dursley, despite the fact that he and his son were much larger than her. Between June and August of 1995, she lost a good deal of weight and appeared paler, though she seemed to get a healthier look back by the next year. 

Personality and traits
Molly's motherly affection towards Harry Potter
Molly was a kind-hearted, gentle, loving, and very motherly woman. It was comfortable to be around such a sympathetic and warm person. Being in the same room with her was very reassuring. Appalled at the mistreatment that Harry suffered at the Dursleys, Molly was delighted to have Harry stay with the Weasleys at The Burrow, where she could offer food, advice, and general mothering. Starved for affection from his own aunt Petunia, Harry found warmth from Molly, who considered to be his closest mother figure.  

Molly could have even her twin sons cowering before her if she was angry enough. She was fiercely proud of her children's accomplishments, but was also scandalised by their misbehaviour, being particularly frustrated for the twins' antics. She wasn't above of sending a Howler to the school to humiliate one of them publicly for stepping out of line, as evidenced by her reaction to the use of the unauthorised Flying Ford Anglia by Ron to reach Hogwarts at his second school year. Ironically, it was high achiever Percy who caused her the most pain, breaking with the family for their unwavering allegiance to Albus Dumbledore.  

Harry occasionally found Molly's over-protectiveness somewhat smothering. Along with her eldest son Bill, she came to watch Harry in the Triwizard Tournament and after his ordeal in the graveyard, visited him in Hogwarts' hospital wing, where she hugs him 'how Harry imagined a mother would'. However, Molly sometimes found it difficult to cope with her children heading out in their own, separate directions. Not surprisingly, she considered Fleur Delacour wrong for Bill when they become engaged until the latter showed her true feelings. When Harry asked about what the Order of the Phoenix was doing against Voldemort, she continually insisted he shouldn't be told more than he needed to know under Dumbledore's orders. However, his godfather Sirius believed that he had to dealt with more than the Order could imagine and thus deserved to have the whole picture. Though Harry was touched by Molly's actions, he felt Sirius was right in that he wasn't a small child and should be treated as a maturing adult, something which she understood but still worried about.      

Magical abilities and skills
Molly slays Bellatrix during the Battle of Hogwarts
Love: Molly was a very loving person and the epitome of a good mother, loving all her children dearly and often came to regard close friends as family too. She grew so fond of Harry Potter that her Boggart changed accordingly to include his dead body along with her family. Motivated by her love for her family, Molly bravely took on Bellatrix Lestrange and killed her to defend her daughter Ginny.
Nonverbal magic: During the Battle of Hogwarts, Molly could cast spells without saying them verbally while she duelled. Since non-verbal magic is very difficult, this testifies that she was actually a powerful witch in her own right.
Duelling: Molly was shown to be a surprisingly skilful and even lethal duellist, especially when her family was threatened. In 1998, she took part in the Battle of Hogwarts where she single-handedly killed Bellatrix, a dangerous member of Voldemort's followers, after the Death Eater had nearly killed her daughter.
Charms: Molly was shown to have been very talented in this field of magic. Before the Battle of Hogwarts, she was one of the individuals who cast the many powerful protective enchantments — such as Protego Maxima — over the school. She could also produce a non-corporeal Patronus Charm, a mark of her superior magical ability given its immense difficulty. Molly was highly skilled in food-related charms, to the point where her son Ron was under the impression she could create good food from nothing. However, it was clear that she used magic to make the food she cooked even tastier, as Harry Potter considered her the best cook he knew. She was also capable of casting a powerful Imperturbable Charm.
Dark Arts: Molly was normally a good-natured woman who did not actively practise dark magic, but she was actually capable of casting Dark charms with lethal effect. During her duel against Bellatrix, she effectively cast a wide variety of curses and ultimately killed her opponent with a curse that struck her over her heart. She also confidently threatened to either jinx or hex Ron, Fred, and George on numerous occasions. The fact that none of them seemed to cross her when she issues this threat could be a testament to her talent.
Healing magic: Molly was a competent healer, as shown by how she was able to treat George's injuries despite his having lost a lot of blood after the Battle of the Seven Potters. However, she was unable to regrow his lost ear, as it was caused by the Sectumsempra curse. She also owned a copy of The Healer's Helpmate, a book would have helped her understand and perform medical magic.
Potions: Molly had effectively brewed a Love Potion in her youth, a N.E.W.T.-level potion, implying Molly was highly proficient in potion-making, particularly with making advanced brews.
Transfiguration: Molly was capable of performing Conjuration, a very advanced and difficult branch of transfiguration, as she was able to effectively conjure sauce from her wand whilst cooking food.
Apparition: Like most adult wizards, Molly was capable of apparating successfully at will.

Relationships
Family
Prewett family
Molly was born into the Prewett family. Her relationship with her mother and father is unknown, but it is possible that, like the Weasleys, the Prewetts didn't buy into values of pure-blood supremacy held by so many other wizarding pure blood families.

Her brothers, Fabian and Gideon Prewett, were both members of the Order of the Phoenix during the First Wizarding War, but were brutally killed by five Death Eaters. It is likely that Molly was close to her brothers, as she kept Fabian's watch until she gave it to Harry Potter for his seventeenth birthday. Their deaths influenced her later protectiveness of her family during the Second Wizarding War.

Molly had an uncle, Ignatius Prewett, whose name became her son Percy's middle name, and aunt by marriage Lucretia Prewett (née Black). Her irritable great-aunt Muriel was still alive in the 1990s and associated with her family.

Weasley family

Molly pampered her seven children as much as she could afford to, making up for the lack of funds for new books, brooms and robes by showering her loved ones with affection and providing them with abundant and delicious home-cooking and handmade gifts. However, Molly had no qualms about speaking her mind and enforcing discipline when her children put a "toe out of line"; the only thing Hermione Granger could do to stop Fred and George testing their Skiving Snackboxes on first years prior to their departure from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was threaten to write to their mother, something which genuinely scared them. She constantly tried to pressure Bill into cutting his hair and not dressing as flashily as he liked to. Molly had a strong desire for her children to work at the Ministry of Magic like their father, causing her to scold Fred and George on numerous occasions for their dream of managing a joke shop. In the end, she clearly wanted her children to be happy in their careers, being impressed when Fred and George proved to be skilled businessmen.

Molly's and Arthur's affection and love for each other
Though she was frequently exasperated with her husband's quirky fascination with Muggle artefacts and his seeming inability to act as a firm disciplinarian when it came to many of their sons' shenanigans, Molly clearly loved Arthur dearly and was fiercely proud of all he had accomplished in his career.
