<html><p>During the 1995–1996 school year, Dolores Umbridge, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, was made High Inquisitor of Hogwarts. When Umbridge inspected Professor Flitwick's N.E.W.T. Charms Class, he treated her like a guest and was very polite. But when she inspected his rehearsal with the Hogwarts choir, Umbridge measured his height, which he found insulting. When she became Headmistress of the school, Flitwick, along with the rest of the staff and the students, was against her. After Fred and George Weasley released fireworks into the corridors, Umbridge spent an entire day running around putting them out, and Flitwick later said that he could have easily put them all out, but was not sure that he "had the authority" to do so, and then wrapped the conversation up by smilingly slamming the door in her snarling face. The twins also released a Portable Swamp into another one of the corridors, and, once Umbridge had been suspended, Flitwick vanished it in a second, but left a small patch since he considered it to be a good piece of magic.

Etymology
Filius is Latin for "son", and the filius philosophorum, meaning "the philosophers' son" is a symbol in alchemy, sometimes associated with the philosopher's stone.
The surname Flitwick may come from the Charms professor's own advice for wand movement: "swish and flick". Flitwick is also the name of an English town, pronounced "Flittick". To flit is to move quickly from one location to another. A wick is a loosely woven strand of fabric or fibres, often used in a candle or oil lamp.

Behind the scenes

Flitwick is portrayed by British actor Warwick Davis in the Harry Potter film adaptations. He also provided the character's voice in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery.
Davis also provided the voice of Griphook the Goblin in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and portrayed him again (both physical form and voice) in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Part 2. Therefore, Davis is one of the 14 actors to appear in all eight film adaptations.
Flitwick's goblin ancestry explains not only why the Professor is so small, but also his great wit and intelligence, which were the reasons for his being sorted into Ravenclaw.
In the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the Chamber of Secrets speech is given by Flitwick instead of Cuthbert Binns, the History of Magic professor.
Strangely, despite her hatred of "Half-breeds", Dolores Umbridge did not seem to hate Professor Flitwick, as the Weasley twins stated that she gave him a good review. However, this may be due to the fact that his "half-breed" ancestry comes from a distant relative or it could be she simply saw him as a man with dwarfism. In the film, though, Umbridge is seen patronisingly measuring his height.
The line "Dr Flitwick" appears (crossed out) in a page from an early draft of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.
The new look of Flitwick has an item on merchandise, a minifigure by LEGO.
In a deleted scene from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Flitwick battles Nagini in the Marble Staircase during the Battle of Hogwarts.
Curiously, in the U.S. edition of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, no mention is made of Flitwick insisting on going off to look after the Ravenclaws or him having been knocked out, only that he was "hurt."
J. K. Rowling once stated that Professor Flitwick had a background story that would ultimately be left out of the books due to low relevance to the plot - something she compared to Dean Thomas.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Flitwick sat at the left side of Professor Rubeus Hagrid at the High Table . In this scene, Hagrid, entranced by Madam Maxime, the Headmistress of the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, who sat on the other side of the High Table, absent-mindedly speared his fork in what he thought was his steak, but instead accidentally stabbed the back of Flitwick's right hand, causing the Charms professor to yell in pain and insult Hagrid.
Portrayal in the films
Flitwick as depicted in the first two film adaptations and the first three video games
Flitwick's appearance in the film adaptations is sporadic. His only major scene in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is during the Charms lesson where he teaches the spell Wingardium Leviosa. Flitwick was written out of the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban; however, Warwick Davis was offered a small part as the conductor of the Hogwarts chorus appearing as a small man with brown hair and moustache, identified in the credits only as "wizard". Despite Warwick's appearance as a conductor in the film of Prisoner of Azkaban, in the video game version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Flitwick appears as a teacher, and his physical appearance is as it was for the first two films and first two video games. This same character reappeared in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire although now identified as Professor Flitwick. Warwick Davis jokingly suggested he crowd surf during the Yule Ball scene. He admits he now knows to never make such jokes again.

Younger appearing Flitwick from the fourth film and fifth video game onwards
According to interviews, director Mike Newell liked the look of a younger Flitwick. In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, he is seen in a Chorus Class in the Great Hall. He is seen again cheering when Fred and George Weasley depart Hogwarts. In the video game adaptation of Order of the Phoenix, Filius Flitwick is seen with his new look in his class. Filius, with his post-Chamber look, is finally confirmed on-screen in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. He also displays a far more prickly demeanour than in Philosopher's Stone. Flitwick's physical appearance in the first two films is credited as the teacher and his physical appearance in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince merchandise (The Annual 2009 Poster Sticker Book) also uses the elder Flitwick, although the packaging of the LEGO figure uses the younger Flitwick. Also, Warwick Davis who plays Flitwick believes himself that the two characters (Conductor and Teacher) are different people but perhaps related. However despite Warwick Davis believing this, in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Harry confirms them both to be the same character in a conversation with Flitwick, and in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Professor McGonagall calls him "Filius", as does Professor Slughorn in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. 

Popular in-universe explanations for the change in appearance are that he decided to get a makeover, or that he was involved in a magical accident resulting in his change in appearance. However, without any on-screen or in-print confirmation, the discrepancy remains a mystery and it has caused confusion amongst viewers and a rather large inconsistency.

It has also been noticed that Flitwick's role as from the fourth film, has been used for comic relief, due to his snappy personality and unexpected, comical behaviour (e.g. his contribution to the cheering when the Weasley twins left Hogwarts; the conversation between him, Harry and Luna in the sixth film and his flight from the Viaduct when the Giants close in during the Battle of Hogwarts in the second part of the seventh film).

 3.0 3.1 Flitwick is seen supervising James and Sirius's OWLs, so was at least 17 by 1975.

 He cannot have been Muggle-born because he was at Hogwarts during the 1997–1998 school year, but he could not have been pure-blood because of his goblin ancestor.

 JKR stated that Flitwick has a "dash" of goblin blood.

 In order to be a Head of House, that person must have been a member of that House, so Flitwick attended Hogwarts as a Ravenclaw.
