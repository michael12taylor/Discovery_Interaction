<html><p>Hermione comforted Ginny after an encounter with Dementors upset her in 1993,[30] and after the death of her brother Fred in 1998.[11] However, Hermione would not have been afraid to stand up to Ginny when she felt that Ginny was wrong. The two remained very close after the war and eventually became sisters-in-law when Hermione married Ron, making her an aunt to Ginny's three children, James, Albus, and Lily, as well as being chosen to be godmother to Ginny's eldest son James, and making Ginny Rose and Hugo's aunt and almost certainly Rose's godmother.

Neville Longbottom
Neville Longbottom, her friend
Hermione was good friends with Neville Longbottom. They met on the train to Hogwarts during their first year and she helped him search for his toad Trevor.[3] Hermione helped Neville many times with their school work, particularly with Potions, as Professor Snape noted that she was often "hissing instructions in his ear."[30] In their fourth year, Hermione noticed Neville's horrified reaction to witnessing the Cruciatus Curse be performed on a spider by Professor Alastor Moody (actually Barty Crouch Jnr), and shrieked for the teacher to stop. That same year, Neville asked Hermione to attend the Yule Ball with him, as she had "always been really nice" to him, though she had already agreed to accompany Viktor Krum.[31]

Hermione often fiercely defended Neville when others insulted him, and her friendship and support, as well as that of other D.A. members, likely contributed to Neville gradually gaining self-confidence and courage.[11] Neville was obviously very fond of Hermione, and appreciative of her kindness and all the help she had given him. It was hinted that he spoke of her frequently to his grandmother, Augusta Longbottom, who seemed to already know a good deal about Hermione when they first met at Saint Mungo's in 1995. Following the war, they kept in touch.

Luna Lovegood
Luna Lovegood, a good friend
Although Hermione rarely saw eye-to-eye with Luna Lovegood due to their very different world views and beliefs, the two became very good friends through Dumbledore's Army. Hermione first met Luna on the Hogwarts Express in 1995; she insulted The Quibbler, but backtracked when Luna told her that her father was the editor. Hermione was frustrated with Luna's belief in all manner of things without proof or logical grounds, but eventually simply accepted their differences, telling Luna that her planned trip to Sweden in search of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack sounded "lovely".[29]

The following year, Luna comforted Hermione when she was upset over her fight with Ron.[32] Hermione was one of the five portraits Luna painted — along with Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Neville — and hung from her bedroom ceiling, the word "friends" linking them in gold writing. When Xenophilius Lovegood attempted to turn Harry, Ron, and Hermione over to Death Eaters in exchange for his daughter's safety, Hermione engineered their escape so that the Death Eaters saw Harry briefly, thus ensuring that both Luna and her father were not harmed. Despite disagreeing with Luna on many things herself, Hermione defended her when others insulted her; for example, she tried to kick Ron for teasing Luna about Gurdyroots at the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour, and snapped at the portrait of Phineas Nigellus Black for calling Luna an oddity. The two girls remained close friends in adulthood and saw each other regularly. Luna may be one of the best female friends of Hermione (along with Ginny), as she was only seen with these girls during her school-time at Hogwarts.[11]

Sirius Black
Sirius Black, her friend
Hermione first learned about Sirius Black in 1993, when he escaped Azkaban. The wizarding world at large knew of him as the wizard who murdered twelve Muggles and a wizard (Peter Pettigrew) with a single curse. Very few knew of his affiliation with the Potters and those who did also believed that Sirius had betrayed James and Lily Potter to Voldemort by revealing their location at Godric's Hollow. During the events at Hogwarts in 1993, Hermione along with Harry, Ron and Lupin discovered that, contrary to their previous beliefs, Sirius Black had never committed the murders for which he had been incarcerated, nor had he betrayed his closest friends. 

The trio managed to save Sirius and Lupin from being subjected to the Dementor's Kiss at the hands of Severus Snape by firing three simultaneous Disarming Charms at him. Snape was blasted off his feet and knocked unconscious, allowing Harry, Ron and Hermione to continue their interrogation of Sirius who later revealed that Pettigrew had disguised himself in his rat Animagus form for twelve years in order to escape justice and the wrath of Voldemort's remaining Death Eaters. However, upon exiting the Whomping Willow's secret passageway together, Pettigrew shrewdly used Lupin's werewolf transformation as a distraction and escaped. Sirius was soon apprehended and locked in Filius Flitwick's office to await the Dementor's Kiss. Harry and Hermione would later use the latter's Time-Turner to rescue Sirius, who became deeply grateful to both of them.

In 1994, Hermione, Harry, and Ron visited Sirius at the cave off Hogsmeade village he was hiding in, bringing him food. Here they discussed the many mysteries that had occurred during that year, the trio learning valuable pieces of information regarding the imprisonment of Barty Crouch Jnr After the events of the Third Task, Sirius (while in his Animagus form) joined Hermione, Ron and Molly Weasley at Harry's bedside, each indicating their affections for the latter.

Hermione and Sirius would not meet again until the summer of 1995, at the Headquarters of the second Order of the Phoenix. Sirius was obliged to remain in 12 Grimmauld Place for his own safety (his innocence not yet recognised by the Ministry). Sirius was rather disappointed when Harry was allowed to return to Hogwarts, Hermione pointing out that he had probably been secretly wishing that Harry had been expelled from school so that they could both stay at Grimmauld Place and be "outcasts together". Hermione expressed an even deeper understanding of Sirius's emotions when she stated her opinion to Harry that Sirius was attempting to relive his happier school days through his godson. Harry ignored this and became slightly agitated at the suggestion that Sirius might be guilty of such a crude, selfish mentality. However, she severely disapproved of his indifferent and occasionally cruel treatment of his house-elf, Kreacher, despite the fact that Kreacher initially appeared to be disgusted by her and addressed her as "the Mudblood" (which Hermione often attributed to Kreacher being senile due to his old age.) 

She also thought that Sirius was attempting to live vicariously through her, Harry and Ron when he encouraged them to form Dumbledore's Army, but the two boys became angry and snapped at her when she expressed this belief. Sirius was eventually killed by Bellatrix Lestrange in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, much to the dismay of his friends and loved ones. Hermione was devastated by his death, and often tried to provide comfort to Harry, who had been even more deeply affected by the tragedy. At the end of the Second Wizarding War, Hermione became godmother to Harry's eldest son, James Sirius, whose first and middle name was derived from James Potter and Sirius Black respectively.

Crookshanks
Hermione with Crookshanks
Crookshanks was Hermione's large, bandy-legged, half-Kneazle, ginger-coloured pet cat since she bought him from the Magical Menagerie in Diagon Alley, in 1993. She seemed to think he was gorgeous, although no one else had wanted to buy him when he was still being sold at the Menagerie. She was proud of his cleverness. The latter proved to be quite true during the 1993–1994 school year.[30]

Crookshanks recognised that Hermione had left him at the Burrow before Bill and Fleur's wedding in 1997,[11] most likely had been left in care of Mrs Weasley or Ginny, but it is possible that they were reunited after the Second War given the deep care and affection they had for each other.

Hogwarts Students
Roommates
Lavender Brown, her roommate and romantic rival
Hermione's roommates at Hogwarts were fellow Gryffindors Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil as well as Fay Dunbar and another girl. While Lavender and Parvati swiftly became best friends, Hermione was not very close to either of them. Although the girls did not dislike each other, they had very different interests and sometimes clashed as a result. 

For example, Hermione scorned Divination, Lavender and Parvati's favourite subject, and accidentally upset Lavender with her clumsy attempt to comfort her over the death of her rabbit.[30] Hermione was also angry with Lavender for doubting Harry Potter's assertion that Lord Voldemort had returned in 1995 and snapped at her about it. 

Parvati Patil, her roommate
When Lavender began dating Ron Weasley, she was very upset and confided in Harry about her feelings. Once they broke up however, Hermione chose to not display open affection towards Ron so Lavender's feelings would not get hurt. She also came to Lavender's rescue during the Battle of Hogwarts, blasting Fenrir Greyback away from her.[11] Unfortunately Lavender was mortally wounded by Greyback and was already dead by the time Hermione reached her. It can be assumed that Hermione was at least saddened by Lavenders death.

Hermione had a less tumultuous relationship with Parvati, although the two were not close. During Hermione's first year at Hogwarts, she hugged Parvati after Harry caught the Snitch at a Quidditch game. Parvati was noted to feel guilty after laughing at Ron's cruel teasing of Hermione in Transfiguration, and the two discussed Hermione's attendance of the Slug Club Christmas party with Cormac McLaggen. As Parvati looked “positively agog” at Hermione confiding in her,[32] it can be assumed that Hermione seldom discussed personal matters with her room mates.

Cormac McLaggen
Cormac McLaggen
Cormac McLaggen was a Gryffindor student one year above Hermione. The two became acquainted in 1996 through the Slug Club, of which they were both members, though Hermione did not think highly of McLaggen. When she overheard him insulting Ron and Ginny during Quidditch try-outs, Hermione struck him with the Confundus Charm, undermining his abilities as a Keeper. 

Later in the year, when Hermione was furious with Ron for dating Lavender Brown, she decided to attend Professor Slughorn's Christmas party with McLaggen because she knew Ron despised him. McLaggen was apparently interested in Hermione, as he escorted her to the party and was very forward with her romantically while there. This, as well as his tendency to boast about himself, put Hermione off, and she soon abandoned him for the company of Harry and Luna before leaving the party altogether to avoid him.[32] It can be assumed that the party was the end of their interaction.

Cho Chang in her fifth year
Cho Chang
Hermione had a two sided history with Cho; while Hermione offered Harry advice for making his relationship with Cho successful, Cho thought that Hermione’s friendship with Harry was romantic and got increasingly jealous of her since Harry spends so much time with her. Hermione has no grudges for Cho however and was not angry at her when Harry told Hermione that Cho insulted her, instead rather cross at Harry for messing up his own relationship. When Harry arrives at the Room of Requirement with Ron and Hermione, shortly after the Battle of Hogwarts all hard feelings seemed to have been forgotten or forgiven as Cho greeted Hermione in a friendly way, probably since Cho had long broke up with Harry. The two seemed to be on neutral terms.

Enemies
Lord Voldemort
Lord Voldemort, her enemy
Hermione first learned about Lord Voldemort, the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time, after reading about him sometime before she began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. During her first year, she and Ron Weasley helped Harry Potter reach the Philosopher's Stone and protect it from Voldemort. 

A year later, Hermione, after fully recovering from her Polyjuice mishap, was shown T. M. Riddle's Diary by Harry. At first enthusiastic that the book might have "magical powers", Hermione first came up with the theory that it was Tom Riddle who originally "caught" the "Heir of Slytherin" when the Chamber of Secrets had been opened fifty years prior. She also correctly guessed that the Diary contained the answers to the Chamber's location, how to open it, and the true identity of Slytherin's monster. Thinking that the Diary was written in invisible ink, the attempted to use the spell Aparecium, and then a Revealer, on the object, but to no effect. Later on, when Harry went to the trophy room to try to learn more about Tom Riddle, he was accompanied by an "interested" Hermione. When Ron compared Riddle to Percy "in disgust", mentioning the former as being "Prefect, Head Boy... probably at the top of every class", Hermione responded in a "slightly hurt" voice, "You say that like it's a bad thing."  

Later on, she also correctly deduced that Riddle had "caught the wrong person", and that "it was some other monster [not Hagrid's Acromantula, Aragog] that was killing people". Later on, after Harry mentioned "hearing the voice" again before the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, Hermione ran immediately to the Library to research, where realised that Slytherin's monster was a basilisk. Tearing the page out of the book, and putting it in her right hand, she left the Library, where she warned the first person she met, Penelope Clearwater, to look around corners with her mirror. However, both Hermione and Penelope were petrified  by Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk, which was controlled by Tom Riddle's memory. 

In 1995, she learned that the Dark Lord had returned and supported Harry against the Ministry's denial and smear campaign. She also fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries to prevent Voldemort from obtaining a vital prophecy, but was severely injured and rendered unconscious. In 1997, she left Hogwarts to help Harry and Ron find and destroy Voldemort's horcruxes. She personally destroyed Helga Hufflepuff's Cup using a basilisk's fang. She later witnessed Harry's defeat of Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts.

However, Hermione made very little direct contact with Voldemort, truly seeing him for the first time during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Possibly the closest connection Hermione and Voldemort shared was through the former wearing Salazar Slytherin's Locket whilst travelling with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley in 1997. The Horcrux locket was worn by all three for regular, though limited, periods of time, inadvertently allowing the portion of soul within to access the wearer's thoughts, emotions and deepest fears. The Horcrux had learned enough about Hermione to use hers and Harry's likenesses in emotionally torturing Ron, reflecting Ron's deepest fears of Hermione preferring Harry to him. Because the Horcrux had become so disconnected from the once whole soul of Tom Riddle, the physically bodied Voldemort was not aware of any of these events, nor of the information the Horcrux had gained dangling around the necks of Harry and his closest friends. 

Although they had very little direct contact, Hermione and Voldemort are sometimes similar: both are "model students" who achieved outstanding grades in NEWTS. Both were Prefects, although Voldemort was Head Boy while Hermione skipped school during what would have been her seventh year due to political persecution, preventing her from being Head Girl that year (it is possible that Hermione became Head Girl when she went back to finish her seventh year after Voldemort's final destruction). They both came from Muggle backgrounds, but Voldemort was raised in an orphanage while Hermione was brought up in a loving Muggle family.

Bellatrix Lestrange
Bellatrix Lestrange, a hated enemy
Bellatrix Lestrange was one of Voldemort's most fanatically loyal followers; Hermione initially knew her as one of the Death Eaters involved in torturing and permanently incapacitating Frank and Alice Longbottom, though she also witnessed Bellatrix murder Sirius Black at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, in 1996.

During the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor, Bellatrix chose to torture Hermione, who, as a Muggle-born, Bellatrix felt was most dispensable (though, as a "blood traitor," Ron Weasley was a close second), in order to discover where and how the trio had managed to acquire Godric Gryffindor's Sword. During the interrogation, Bellatrix used her knife to carve the word "mudblood" on Hermione's arm,[46] as well as torturing her sadistically with the Cruciatus Curse.[11] Hermione later used one of Bellatrix's hairs obtained in the skirmish to make Polyjuice Potion and break into the Lestrange Vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank. She expressed disgust at having to  use Bellatrix's wand knowing the crimes Bellatrix commited with it. Hermione, Ginny, and Luna duelled against Bellatrix during the final battle, but were made to stand aside by Molly Weasley, who eventually killed Bellatrix herself.

Draco Malfoy
Draco Malfoy, her school bully
Draco Malfoy, of an old and wealthy pure-blood family with Death Eater ties, was raised to believe in the inferiority of Muggle-borns, and thus treated Hermione with disdain. This was probably exacerbated by Hermione's friendship with Harry and Ron, who shared a strong enmity with Draco from virtually the moment they met, and her beating Draco in school marks, for which his father berated him.[4] Draco frequently called Hermione the disparaging term "Mudblood," which usually set off the tempers of her friends — and the entire Gryffindor Quidditch team when he first said it to her face in 1992[4] — but Hermione tended to ignore Draco and urged Harry and Ron to do the same. 

Occasionally she would snap back at him, and in their third year, she even slapped him when he mocked Rubeus Hagrid for being upset over the impending execution of Buckbeak, for which Draco was largely responsible.[30]

In spite of his prejudice and dislike toward Hermione, Draco was reluctant to confirm her identity when he was asked to do so by his parents and aunt Bellatrix in 1998, avoiding even looking at her. As an adult sobered by his wartime experiences, Draco was civil towards Hermione and her friends, and friendly with her nephew, Albus Potter.[11]He even found the idea of taking orders from her during their ambush in 1981 of Delphini to be darkly humorous. Draco's civility towards Hermione during this time was likely reinforced due to her being the Minister For Magic in Britain at the time, and possibly due to her relations to Albus Potter, the best friend of his own son, Scorpius. 

Pansy Parkinson
Pansy Parkinson
Pansy Parkinson was more or less Hermione's polar opposite: where Hermione was compassionate (as seen when she founded SPEW), independent, and incredibly helpful to nearly anyone who needed it, Pansy was petty and spiteful, who mocked just about every non-Slytherin student she encountered (as well as Hagrid), and was little more than one of Draco Malfoy's more sycophantic lackeys. Pansy had a tendency to taunt and snipe at Hermione, Harry, and Ron at any given opportunity, though Hermione rarely seemed more than slightly irritated by her comments; the major exception to that most likely would have been Pansy's attempt to surrender Harry to Lord Voldemort shortly prior to the start of the Battle of Hogwarts. Hermione had a scathing opinion of Pansy, believing her to be be a "cow", and "thicker than a concussed troll".[29]

Rita Skeeter
Rita Skeeter
While covering the Triwizard Tournament in Hermione's fourth year, Daily Prophet journalist Rita Skeeter wrote a number of exaggerated and slanderous stories about Harry Potter and his friends, including one that outed Rubeus Hagrid as a half-giant. Harry and Hermione angrily confronted Rita about this. After Hermione insulted her, Rita published another article that portrayed Hermione as manipulative and ambitious, claiming that she was toying with the emotions of both Harry Potter and Viktor Krum. This resulted in Hermione receiving several letters of hate mail, including a few Howlers and at least one envelope filled with bubotuber pus.

Hermione became obsessed with getting back at Rita and uncovering how she was getting all of her information. Finally, near the end of the school year Hermione realised that Rita Skeeter was an unregistered Animagus. She caught Rita in her beetle form attempting to eavesdrop on Harry in the Hospital Wing after the Third Task. Hermione sealed her inside a small bottle. Hermione blackmailed Rita into giving up writing for one year, otherwise her unregistered status would be revealed. As the penalties are apparently quite severe, Rita had no choice but to comply.

When the Ministry of Magic began using the Daily Prophet in its smear campaign against Harry, Hermione was again able to blackmail Rita, this time into writing an article for The Quibbler that would allow Harry to tell his side of the story. After her one year punishment was over, Rita went back to writing with as much enthusiasm and as little scruples as she had before, although it's unknown if she ever crossed Hermione again. Given her notable lack of commentary regarding Hermione during the 2014 Quidditch World Cup in Egypt, it is likely that Rita remained extremely wary of Hermione's wrath 19 years following her being blackmailed by the prodigious witch.

Organisations
Dumbledore's Army
Dumbledore's Army, her allies
Dumbledore's Army was essentially Hermione's brainchild, though she co-founded it with Ron and Harry during the 1995–1996 school year. After Dolores Umbridge informed her Defence Against the Dark Arts students that they would not be using any magic, claiming a theoretical education would suffice, a furious Hermione (fearful of being ill-equipped to deal with the reborn Lord Voldemort and the upcoming O.W.L.s) conceived of the organisation as a means of allowing any student interested in actually practising defensive magic to do so. Though the secret classes were taught by Harry, Hermione arranged the initial meeting at the Hog's Head, created the DA's method of covert communication, and jinxed their member list to reveal any betrayal. 

All of the DA members grew closer over the course of the year (with the exceptions of Marietta Edgecombe, who betrayed the DA to Umbridge, and later Zacharias Smith, who deserted them), as evidenced by their reunion in 1997, and their enthusiasm in supporting Harry and mobilising against the invading Death Eaters during the Battle of Hogwarts. Moreover, the DA truly cemented Hermione's friendships with Luna Lovegood and Neville Longbottom, who were the only members, aside from Ginny Weasley, to fight alongside Hermione, Harry, and Ron at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.

Order of the Phoenix
The original Order of the Phoenix, her allies
Hermione first heard about the Order of the Phoenix in 1995, when she, Harry and Ron spent several weeks at the Order's headquarters. Through her time at Grimmauld Place, Hermione got to know Alastor Moody, the most famous Auror of modern times, known for rounding up several Death Eaters after the First Wizarding War and for his growing paranoia. He and Hermione fought together in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, and later, in the Battle of the Seven Potters, where Moody was killed by Voldemort's own hand. Hermione, like the rest of the Order, was shocked and horrified by the death of such a skilled Auror, "the consummate survivor,"[11] and disgusted by Mundungus Fletcher's desertion. Hermione, who had known Fletcher as a petty criminal who had stolen a number the Black family heirlooms shortly after Sirius Black's death, aside from being a member of the Order, took part in interrogating Fletcher, when she, Harry and Ron realised Salazar Slytherin's Locket had been among the items stolen from Grimmauld Place.

Hermione had great respect for Kingsley Shacklebolt, a skilled Auror and eventual Minister for Magic, who was known as "Royal" on Potterwatch, and who saved countless lives (including Hermione, Ron and Harry's) when he sent his Patronus to warn the attendees of Bill and Fleur's wedding that the Ministry had fallen, and with it, the protections surrounding the Burrow. Another member of the Order responsible for saving the trio was Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus' younger brother. Though Hermione, Harry and Ron had known him for some time as the owner of the Hog's Head Pub, they finally met him in 1998, just before the Battle of Hogwarts, when he just barely managed to get them out a trap set by Death Eaters. Prior to that, he sent Dobby to rescue them, along with Dean Thomas, Luna Lovegood, Garrick Ollivander and Griphook the Goblin, from the Malfoy Manor; as it turned out, Aberforth had acquired Sirius Black's two-way mirror from Mundungus Fletcher, and been keeping an eye out for Harry.

Nymphadora Tonks, a funny, Metamorphmagus witch, who had become a good friend of Hermione's, died along with her husband and fellow member of the Order, Remus Lupin, during the Battle of Hogwarts. As their son, Ted Lupin, was Harry's godson and was also dating Hermione's niece, Victoire by 2017, it's likely Hermione remained quite close to him.

Professors & Other Hogwarts Staff
Albus Dumbledore
Albus Dumbledore, her former headmaster
As with most aspects of the wizarding world, Hermione read about Albus Dumbledore shortly after learning that she was a witch. Hermione on her very first train journey revealed she wanted to be in Gryffindor because it was the house that Dumbledore belonged to. She first met the Hogwarts headmaster during her her first year at the school, in 1991, and quickly came to respect Dumbledore's immense power and seemingly infinite wisdom. Although Dumbledore was not as close with her as he was with Harry Potter, he showed great insight into her character very early on. She was one of only three students Dumbledore bequeathed a personal item, as he believed her to be, along with Ron Weasley, trustworthy of accompanying Harry on his mission to destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes.

He respected her intellect, perspicacity, and level-headedness, admitting to Harry that he had counted on Hermione to keep things in perspective when the trio finally discovered the existence of the Deathly Hallows. Hermione was devastated when Dumbledore was killed, and visited his portrait with Harry and Ron after the Battle of Hogwarts to determine the fate of the Hallows.

Rubeus Hagrid
Rubeus Hagrid, her friend and professor
Rubeus Hagrid was the Gamekeeper and Care of Magical Creatures professor at Hogwarts, as well as a member of the Order of the Phoenix during the First and Second Wizarding Wars. Since Hagrid had met Harry Potter prior to the start of Hermione's first year at Hogwarts, Hermione grew closer to Hagrid as her friendship with Harry developed, eventually coming to visit him in his hut regularly with Harry and Ron Weasley. In their second year, Hagrid comforted Hermione when she was called a "a filthy little mudblood" by Draco Malfoy. 

Though she disapproved of Hagrid's penchant for collecting dangerous pets, she tended to more pro-actively support him in his efforts to care for them than Harry and Ron, as when Hagrid was attempting to appeal the execution of Buckbeak and raise his half-brother Grawp. In turn, it was Hagrid who encouraged Ron and Harry to re-think their treatment of Hermione when the three had a brief falling out over Hermione getting Harry's new Firebolt confiscated in their third year. When Dolores Umbridge threatened Hagrid's job during the 1995-1996 school year, Hermione advised him to teach only materials related to their O.W.Ls, so as not to give Umbridge any excuse to fire him, and worked tirelessly to keep him on track.

Hagrid remained close to the trio throughout their time at Hogwarts, and fought various battles in the course of the Second Wizarding War. In 2017, Harry's sons planned to meet Hagrid in his hut for tea soon after arriving at school, and it's very likely that Hermione and Ron's daughter would have been joining them.

Remus Lupin
Remus Lupin, her professor and friend
Hermione was among the students who were very impressed by Remus Lupin's teaching in 1993, when he was appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Hermione deduced he was a werewolf during the school year, yet chose to keep it a secret in order to respect his privacy. Towards the end of the year, however, Lupin admitted that he was a werewolf to Harry, Ron and Hermione whilst in the Shrieking Shack. Following the events in this dilapidated building, Lupin became fully prepared to help Sirius Black kill Peter Pettigrew, the wizard who betrayed James and Lily Potter to Voldemort. 

However, thanks to Harry's intervention, they chose not to commit the murder, inadvertently allowing Pettigrew to escape. Lupin had referred to Hermione as the cleverest witch of her age he had ever seen before to this. Hermione, meanwhile, did not concern herself with Lupin's lycanthropy, she judged him only by his good nature and the content of his character.

Hermione met Lupin again in 1995 at the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix. She and Lupin both fought against the Death Eaters during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996, and survived (despite Hermione being side-swiped by Dolohov's curse). They also fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and the Battle of the Seven Potters alongside, both emerging alive and relatively unscathed on the two occasions. Hermione was pleased to learn that Lupin had married Nymphadora Tonks before the Battle of the Seven Potters began, and became even more joyful at the news of Lupin's son, Ted Lupin, being born; joining in on the celebratory festivities at Shell Cottage. Hermione was devastated by Lupin's and Tonks' deaths in 1998, becoming friendly with their orphaned son, Teddy Lupin, later on in life.

Minerva McGonagall
Minerva McGonagall, her Head of House and professor
Professor Minerva McGonagall took a shine to Hermione from the first class she had with her, granting the first-year student in her house one of her "rare smiles" when Hermione successfully transfigured a match into a needle early on in the lesson and long before any other student. She had high expectations for Hermione, and was thus disappointed in her when Hermione claimed she tried to fight the troll that entered the school in 1991 on her own, in order to cover up for Harry and Ron. Whenever Hermione and her friends would get into trouble, McGonagall almost inevitably looked to Hermione to be the most sensible one.[3]

McGonagall was noticeably upset when Hermione was petrified in 1993, even granting Harry and Ron permission to skip a class so they could visit Hermione in the hospital wing.[4] The following school year, she helped arrange for Hermione to be granted a Time-Turner to take extra classes.[30] When the professor was injured with four Stunning Spells in 1996, Hermione was very upset and worried for her.[29] Hermione seemed to regard her head of house as a role model, while Professor McGonagall, in spite of her sternness, was obviously quite fond of Hermione and expected great things of her.

Later, after McGonagall became headmistress of Hogwarts and Hermione became a member of the Ministry of Magic, McGonagall granted her permission to use notes left to the Hogwarts Archives, written by Albus Dumbledore, in her re-translation of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, demonstrating McGonagall's trust in her former pupil.

Severus Snape
Severus Snape, her professor
Severus Snape was the Potions Master during most of Hermione's time at Hogwarts. He was also the Head of Slytherin House, and tended to openly show preferential treatment for the students of his own house, while being quick to criticise and deduct points from Gryffindor students. He was particularly unpleasant towards the trio, and regularly punished and verbally assaulted Harry and Ron for their poor to mediocre performances in his class. He could not do the same to Hermione, as she was the best student in the year and instead mocked her for things like being an "insufferable know-it-all,"[30] once even snidely insulting the size of Hermione's teeth.[31]

Despite his pre-existing dislike for Gryffindor,[11] Snape's treatment of Hermione likely had more to do with her close friendship with Harry. Despite this, Hermione was still seen to defend Snape on occasion when Harry and Ron blamed him for evil deeds which occurred in Hogwarts, like setting the troll in the dungeon and trying to steal the Philosopher's Stone in Harry's first year. In her fifth year she defended Snape while Ron expressed distrust of him, citing the number of times they were wrong about Snape wanting to harm them. After Dumbledore's death, she like many, believed that Snape was a coward who killed a man who trusted him more than anyone. It is unknown exactly how she reacted to learning of Snape's true motives and allegiance, but given her personality, it is highly likely that she came to both forgive her former Professor's cruelty, and even admire him for his bravery.

Dolores Umbridge
Dolores Umbridge, her former professor and enemy
Dolores Umbridge was appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor by the Ministry of Magic, in 1995. She was a sadistic woman who enjoyed punishing and torturing students using the Black Quill, most notably when she forced Harry Potter to carve "I must not tell lies" into the back of his own hand. Umbridge was as obsessed with blood-status as the Death Eaters, and had a particular hatred of what she called "half-breeds." Hermione, like most of the students and staff at Hogwarts, hated Umbridge. Hermione was one of the first to pick up on the true motives behind Umbridge's appointment at the magical school. In turn, Umbridge was not too fond of Hermione, who was not only Muggle-born, but was also probably far too perceptive for her liking, as well as being outspokenly opposed to a purely theoretical defensive magical education. 

When Umbridge planned to use Veritaserum and then the Cruciatus Curse on Harry, Hermione was the one who came up with the lie that led to them venturing into the Forbidden Forest and Umbridge eventually being dragged away by a herd of offended centaurs.

Hermione next met Umbridge a second time at the Ministry of Magic in 1997, when Hermione was disguised as Mafalda Hopkirk through the usage of Polyjuice Potion. Umbridge was, at the time, interrogating "Mudblood" witches and wizards, prior to sending them to Azkaban. Harry stunned Umbridge and retrieved Salazar Slytherin's Locket, one of Voldemort's hocruxes which Umbridge had taken from Mundungus Fletcher and was attempting to pass off as a family heirloom and proof of her relation to the Selwyn family. Hermione replaced the locket by duplicating it with the Geminio spell so Umbridge would not know that it had been taken from her. The trio proceeded to free all the Muggle-Borns awaiting interrogation.

Suffice it to say that Umbridge personified everything that Hermione detested and loathed in Wizarding society, including but not limited to racial prejudice, sadism, malicious misuse of power, authoritarianism, and pure-blood supremacy.

Septima Vector
Septima Vector, her Arithmancy professor
Hermione also had a good relationship with her Arithmancy Professor Septima Vector. Many students disliked Vector because of her strictness. However, Hermione said Arithmancy was her favourite subject at Hogwarts. She also never complained about Vector's strictness. During her third year, Hermione joined her class and used a time-turner to get to one of the lessons.[52] Then in her fourth year, Hermione and the other students got no homework from Septima Vector on the first day of term,[53] and she adamantly refused to skive Arithmancy.[54]

Rowling took Hermione's name from William Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale,[55] saying that she wanted it to be unusual, since if fewer girls shared her name, fewer girls would get teased for it.[55] Rowling's knowledge and interest in Greek mythology may have also influenced her choice in regards to Hermione's name. In 1988, Rowling wrote a short essay about her time studying classics entitled "What was the Name of that Nymph Again? or Greek and Roman Studies Recalled"; it was published by the University of Exeter's journal Pegasus.[56] The name "Hermione" is derived from "Hermes", who was the messenger of the Greek gods, as well as the god of wit, eloquence and quick thinking.


‘Hermione’ is the female derivative of ‘Hermes’, a messenger god known for his sharp wit and ability to transition between worlds. Quite fittingly, Hermione transitioned between the Muggle and wizarding worlds, delivered information, and was pretty sharp-witted herself.

Hermione is also the name of another figure from Greek mythology, who was the princess of Sparta and the only daughter of Helen of Troy and King Menelaus. The name also appears in Jean-Baptiste Lully's play Cadmus et Hermione, based on the story of the goddess of harmony, Harmonia, who married the founder of Thebes. 

In order to ensure that fans could correctly pronounce Hermione's name, a scene was created between Hermione and Viktor Krum in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in which they discuss the correct pronunciation; however, the closest Krum got was "Herm-own-ninny."[57]

In the will of Albus Dumbledore, Hermione's middle name was listed as "Jean;" however, in previous interviews, Rowling had stated that her middle name was "Jane." Rowling cleared this up in a later interview by stating that she had decided that she did not want Hermione to share a middle name with Professor Umbridge, and thus changed it to Jean, which is a female variant of the name John, meaning "God is gracious."[58]

Granger is another word for farmer; specifically, it was the title of a farm bailiff, who oversaw the collection of rent and taxes from the barns of a feudal lord. It is a surname of English and French origin, derived from the Anglo-Norman grainger and the French grangier, both of which come from Latin granica, meaning "granary." It recalls Hermione's Muggle roots. Her original last name was "Puckle," but Rowling later decided this didn't suit her character.

Hermione may be named after Sir Clive Granger, a Nobel Prize-winning British economist who taught in Britain at the University of Nottingham and described the "Granger causality." Or possibly after Granger, one of the society of people who memorised books in Fahrenheit 451.

The reason of choosing such an uncommon name as Hermione for the character is because, according to Rowling, she did not bear getting any child mocked because of sharing a name with an "insufferable know-it-all" such as Hermione.

Hermione is portrayed by French-born British actress Emma Watson in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Part 2 and is one of the 14 characters to appear in all 8 film adaptations. Watson also portrayed her in the short The Queen's Handbag.
Emma Watson actually had to dye her hair darker for the first three films. Emma naturally has light brown hair.
Her hair changes every film, somehow, the cases being:
In the first film, her hair is medium brown, straight, and very bushy.
In the second film, her hair is longer than it ever was in the film series, has grown lighter (caramel brown), and is wavy, not straight.
In The Prisoner of Azkaban, her hair is merely shoulder length and is shown to become curly.
In The Goblet of Fire, her hair has gone a bit bushy again and back to being gently wavy, along with being a lighter brown.
In Order of the Phoenix, Hermione's hair changes yet again: it became almost straight, and its length now reaches just below armpit.
In The Half-Blood Prince, she is seen with a curlier tone  and hair that reaches a few inches above the earlier film.
In the Deathly Hallows films, her hair becomes longer (chest-length) again, but reverts to being straight again, possibly due to the stress of being on the run. Notably, the second film features her hair becoming medium brown again.

Hermione's hair colour in the last five films became lighter due to Emma Watson reverting to her natural hair colour.
As Hermione said in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, she used to wear braces, presumingly in order to correct her dentition. This was then made unnecessary when she let Madam Pomfrey, while shrinking her teeth elongated by Draco Malfoy's Densaugeo hex, "carry on a little bit". According to Hermione, Mr and Mrs Granger wouldn't "be too pleased" by this.
According to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Hermione and all her family can ski, although when it comes to her it isn't "really [her] thing".
Hermione is portrayed by British actress Noma Dumezweni in the original West End production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.[59]
Sophie Thompson plays Hermione when she is disguised as Mafalda Hopkirk in Deathly Hallows: Part 1, as does Helena Bonham Carter when she is disguised as Bellatrix Lestrange in Deathly Hallows: Part 2. Daniel Radcliffe also plays Hermione in the "Seven Potters" scene. However, Emma provided the voice for Hermione while she was in disguise on all three occasions.
Although the novels describe Hermione as having rather large front teeth in her younger years, this is not depicted in the films, as Watson never had large teeth and couldn't speak when applied with bucked teeth.
However, in an on-screen commentary for the Blu-Ray release of Philosopher's Stone, reveals that the final scene of the film does show Hermione's large front teeth. According to Columbus, the scene - which was actually the first to be shot - was filmed with Emma Watson wearing fake teeth to simulate the look of Hermione, but that after filming the sequence it was decided to continue using them would have been impractical. Via edits, the appearance of Hermione's teeth is minimised, but they are still visible when she speaks in the scene.
Also, Hermione's hair is only shown as bushy for the first film. Later, her hair is shown as wavy in the second film, and curly in the third film onwards, although it does briefly take on a bushy appearance for comedic effect during the potion-making contest sequence of the film Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the film is the second one featuring Hermione with curly hair, after Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.
Hermione's Patronus, an otter, is Rowling's favourite animal. The otter is in the family Mustelidae, the same as the weasel, although the latter do not live near water.
Hermione is rendered Hermelien in Dutch and Hermine in German. They in turn are similar to the words Hermelijn in Dutch and Hermelin in German, which means Stoat, which is a species of Weasel.
In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Hermione tells Rufus Scrimgeour that she is not planning to pursue career in Magical Law. Ironically, that's where she ends up after leaving Hogwarts, following a stint in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.
In early drafts, Hermione was supposed to have a Muggle sister.[60] In a 2004 interview with the BBC on World Book Day, J.K. Rowling revealed the following: ‘I always planned that Hermione would have a younger sister but she’s never made an appearance and somehow it feels like it might be too late now.’ This would have made Hermione very similar to Lily Evans; both muggle-born Witches, both having a Muggle sister, both sorted into Gryffindor, both members of the Order of the Phoenix and both going on to marry pure-blood wizards (Lily marrying pure-blood James Potter and Hermione marrying pure-blood Ron Weasley).
On several occasions - during their frequent bickering - Hermione is seen calling Ron by his full name to express her annoyance. Some examples include her squabble with Ron about Scabbers ("Ronald has lost his rat"), and when they argue about Ron's sister Ginny dating Dean Thomas ("Honestly Ronald, they're just holding hands - and snogging").
Hermione admitted to successfully trying out "a few simple spells" just before her first year at Hogwarts,[3] but, in spite of underage magic being banned, she apparently never received a warning from the Improper Use of Magic Office for it. This may be because, since she had not yet attended Hogwarts as an official student, the Ministry overlooked it just as they overlooked when young Tom Riddle used magic before attending Hogwarts to move objects, help him climb down a steep cliff, etc.; and also as they overlooked when young Harry made the glass of the boa constrictor cage disappear, made his own hair grow back to normal long length after Aunt Petunia cut it, etc. Severus Snape indicated as much to Lily Evans when they were both children about Lily's own use of magic before she was a student.
The screenwriter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Steve Kloves has said that Hermione is his favourite character, commenting: "There's something about her fierce intellect coupled with a complete lack of understanding of how she affects people sometimes that I just find charming and irresistible to write."[61]
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Hermione is shown to be aware of what the term "Mudblood" means when Draco Malfoy uses the slur against her, whereas in the novel, she has never heard the word before and Ron explains its meaning to her and Harry.
In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Professor Binns calls Hermione "Miss Grant". It is also made known that Binns calls everyone different names, with Binns also calling Harry Potter "Mr Perkins".</p></html>
