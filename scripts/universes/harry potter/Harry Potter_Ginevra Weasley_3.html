<html><p>J. K. Rowling revealed a picture via her official Twitter account on 18 April, 2016 showing her idea of some of the main character's wand designs, where Ginny's wand wood was revealed for the first time to be made from yew. Interestingly enough, both Harry Potter's wife and mortal enemy share the same wand wood.
Ginny has two soundtracks which are titled as Ginny and When Ginny Kissed Harry on the soundtrack for the film of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.
Ginny Weasley and Harry Potter's romantic relationship is told in a slightly different way in the films from the novels of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2:
In the novel of Half-Blood Prince, Harry shares his first kiss with Ginny in front of the Gryffindor students in the Gryffindor Common Room after the Gryffindor Quidditch team won the Quidditch Cup. Also in the book, Harry ends his romantic relationship with Ginny at Dumbledore's funeral.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ginny and Harry go to the Room of Requirement together to hide the Half-Blood Prince's copy of Advanced Potion-Making, after he curses Draco Malfoy. While there, Ginny asks Harry to close his eyes while she goes and hides the book so that he and other students cannot find it. When she returns to Harry, she kisses him. Harry was very much delighted and surprised that he received a kiss from Ginny. Also at the end of the film, it is implied that Ginny and Harry are still dating.
In the novel of Deathly Hallows, Harry and Ginny kiss in Ginny's room in the Burrow and Ron interrupts them when he opens the door.
In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, Ginny comes down to the sitting room and asks Harry to help zip up her dress. Harry and Ginny then share a kiss that gets interrupted by George Weasley.
In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Ginny and Neville Longbottom are both climbing up on one of the staircases, and run into Harry during the battle. Neville ask Harry if he has seen Luna Lovegood, then he confesses to Ginny and Harry that he has feelings for Luna, he went away to find and tell Luna. Harry and Ginny share a quick kiss, Harry was going to tell Ginny that he loved her, but Ginny quickly told him that she knows, and they both went back to what they were doing before they met up. This did not happen in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows book.

This did not happen in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows book.
In the book of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Ginny is wearing a golden dress at the Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, she is spotted wearing a sliver and black dress at the wedding.
In the LEGO Harry Potter series, Ginny's actions towards Harry are set out differently:    Ginny Weasley in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4  
In Year 2, when she sees Harry arrive, she sighs and giggles at the sight of him. At Flourish and Blotts, she shows no interest in Lockhart and instead attempts to attract Harry. In the Chamber of Secrets, she shows no sign of worry or fear about her own and many other's near deaths, but simply smiles lovingly at Harry, hearts appearing over her.
In Year 4, she seems more concerned over Harry's faint in the Quidditch World Cup than anyone.
In Year 5, she appears to be greatly disappointed over the obvious feelings between Harry and Cho and desperately tries to beat Cho to it, narrowly failing. In the Department of Mysteries, she seems reluctant to go with Luna and Neville rather than Harry. While Harry is being possessed, she rushes up to see the events first and affectionately strokes his arm at the end of the year.
In Year 6, her relationship with Dean is cut and she seems more devoted to Harry as ever, flirting with him at the Burrow and even in front of every one else in the Slug Club. She also appears to have taken Harry to the Room of Requirement simply for the opportunity to kiss Harry.
In Year 7: Part 2, she arrives at the room of Requirement to see Harry. They run towards each other to kiss, but stop and just shake hands awkwardly.
The fact that her relationship with Dean was cut in Year 6 makes it unknown why Harry and Ginny did not attend the Slug Club Christmas Party together. However, they are seen dating in the beginning of the "Slug Club" level after the first cutscene.

Author's comments
"I think you can see that she is a fairly forceful personality (and she always has been, remember Ron saying that she 'never shuts up' in Chamber of Secrets)?"
Ginny Weasley as depicted on  Pottermore
"The plan was, which I really hope I fulfilled, is that the reader, like Harry, would gradually discover Ginny as pretty much the ideal girl for Harry. She's tough, not in an unpleasant way, but she's gutsy. He needs to be with someone who can stand the demands of being with Harry Potter, because he's a scary boyfriend in a lot of ways. He's a marked man. I think she's funny, and I think that she's very warm and compassionate. These are all things that Harry requires in his ideal woman. But, I felt — and I'm talking years ago when all this was planned — initially, she's terrified by his image. I mean, he's a bit of a rock god to her when she sees him first, at 10 or 11, and he's this famous boy. So Ginny had to go through a journey as well… I feel that Ginny and Harry, in this book, they are total equals. They are worthy of each other. They've both gone through a big emotional journey, and they've really got over a lot of delusions, to use your word, together. So, I enjoyed writing that. I really like Ginny as a character."
"The backstory with Ginny was, she was the first girl to arrive in the Weasley family in generations, but there's that old tradition of the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter and a seventh son of a seventh son, so that's why she's the seventh, because she is a gifted witch. I think you get hints of that, because she does some pretty impressive stuff here and there, and you'll see that again."
"Harry and Ginny are real soul mates. They're both very strong and very passionate. That's their connection, and they're remarkable together... I think she's like Harry. He's got an intellectual curiosity and she's got something of belief."
"Harry and Ginny were always meant to be together. I thought it was obvious, but apparently there were internet wars about this."

 16.0 16.1 Although it has never been confirmed that Septimus and Cedrella are Arthur's parents, this can be inferred based on Sirius Black's statement in Ch. 6 of Order of the Phoenix that Arthur was "something like [his] second cousin once removed." The Black family tree establishes Cedrella as a first cousin once removed of both Orion and Walburga Black, Sirius's parents. Thus, any children she had would be their second cousins, and second cousins once removed of their sons Sirius and Regulus. Also, almost all of Sirius's relatives can be seen on the Black family tree as both his parents were born into the House of Black, making it unlikely that he could be related to Arthur in a way not shown.
