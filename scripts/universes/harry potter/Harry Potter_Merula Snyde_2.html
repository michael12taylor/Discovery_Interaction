<html><p>Like Ron Weasley, she suffers from feelings of insecurity and inadequacy born from being in the shadow of another student (in Ron's case his brothers and in Merula's case Jacob's sibling). But where Ron is the best friend of his story's protagonist, Merula is the arch-rival of her's (though she can eventually become more friendly to Jacob's sibling).
Merula bears some similarities to Draco Malfoy, though ironically, Merula could also be said to resemble a young James Potter; like James, Merula was talented but arrogant and something of a bully. But also like James, was loyal to her few friends and over time became more mature and friendly. Should Jacob's sibling choose to romance her, the comparison is strengthened (as both would be pairing off with a fellow student who they initially did not get along with).
Merula is one of the four characters (along with Penny Haywood, Andre Egwu, and Barnaby Lee) available as romance options in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery for all four dating side quests: Celestial Ball, First Date, Valentine's Day, and Festival Fun. As with all other options, this can be done regardless of Jacob's sibling's gender.

↑ Both Merula's parents were wizards, so she was evidently not a Muggle-born. She called Penny Haywood a filthy half-blood, suggesting she's likely a pure-blood.
