<html><p>Hermione's Boggart in her third year was Professor McGonagall telling her that she had "failed everything", which Rowling later commented showed that "underneath Hermione's snootiness there is a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure".[39]
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Hermione is shown to be wearing a pink set of dress robes rather than periwinkle blue, as in the novel.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Hermione told Slughorn and the Slug Club about her parents being dentists, but no one, except Harry, knew what dentists were.
Hermione shared a last name with potioneer Hector Dagworth-Granger, though she informed Horace Slughorn that she did not think they were related, since she was Muggle-born.[32] However, the theory that Muggle-borns have some sort of wizarding ancestry suggests Slughorn might be right about Hermione and Hector being related because every Muggle-born must have had a Squib ancestor.
In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Harry mentions that the only spell Hermione ever had trouble with was the Patronus Charm, although she was among the first of the D.A. to master the spell and casts it successfully multiple times throughout the series. This may have something to do with the emotional nature of the spell; Harry, due to his inability to cut off his emotions, is particularly adept at this spell, while the logical Hermione has issues with it. It may also have something to do with the caster's self confidence as J.K. Rowling has stated that Hermione is afraid of failure and Harry's first powerful uses of the spell, at a Quidditch match and when he saved Sirius, seem more motivated by his confidence rather then a positive memory.
In Harry, A History, Rowling told Melissa Anelli that Steve Kloves had suspected something might happen between Hermione and Harry while reading Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: "He felt a certain pull between them at that point. And I think he's right. There are moments when [Harry and Hermione] touch, which are charged moments. One when she touches his hair as he sits on the hilltop reading about Dumbledore and Grindelwald, and [two] the moment when they walk out of the graveyard with their arms around each other. Now the fact is that Hermione shares moments with Harry that Ron will never be able to participate in. He walked out. She shared something very intense with Harry. So I think it could have gone that way."[51]
Singer Katy B auditioned to play Hermione, but was dismissed when the casting director discovered that she had not read the books.[62] Charlotte Church also auditioned, but was too old for the part.[63]
Watson says that her favourite scene during the film series is the Yule Ball sequence in the fourth film, just like Rupert Grint.
In the Harry Potter books, Hermione has brown hair, but in the films she has more of a light brown.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Hermione snaps at Harry when he tells her to give a message to Ron, saying "I'm not an owl". An owl is used for carrying messages, but her name, Hermione, drives from Hermes, the Greek messenger of the gods.
In the same adaptation, the subplot of Hermione standing up for House-Elves rights was left out of the film adaptations entirely.
In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, Hermione is shown leaving her parents house, however this is only ever mentioned in the books.
In the same film, Hermione is shown to be able to play the piano, which she attempts to teach Ron to do while at Grimmauld Place.
In the same adaptation, Bellatrix uses her knife to carve the word "Mudblood" into Hermione's arm during her interrogation. This was not inscribed in the book, but was an idea that Emma Watson came up with, along with Helena Bonham Carter.
Hermione cries in seven of the eight films:
First film: After Ron insulted her by saying she has no friends because she is a nightmare and hides in the girls' bathroom.
Second film: When she, her friends and the other students cheer for Hagrid after he returns to Hogwarts from Azkaban at the end of the film.
Third film: When she, Harry and Ron saw Buckbeak's apparent execution.
Fourth film: After Ron ruined her night at the Yule Ball.
Sixth film: When Ron started having a relationship with Lavender Brown and when Dumbledore died.
Seventh film: When Ron abandoned her and Harry during the Horcrux hunt, and after Bellatrix has interrogated her and carved the word 'Mudblood' on her arm with her knife.
Eighth film: When she is worried about Harry going into the Forbidden Forest to have Voldemort kill him.
First film: After Ron insulted her by saying she has no friends because she is a nightmare and hides in the girls' bathroom.
Second film: When she, her friends and the other students cheer for Hagrid after he returns to Hogwarts from Azkaban at the end of the film.

Hermione's surname was 'Puckle', in early drafts of Harry Potter. It was later changed to Granger.
Initially, J.K. Rowling had stated that Hermione's middle name was "Jane". However, Rowling later changed it to "Jean" after deciding that she did not want Hermione to share a middle name with Dolores Umbridge.[58]
Hermione's wand wood of vine corresponds to her birthday in the Celtic calendar, which Rowling did intentionally as a connection between Hermione's wand, Harry's wand, and Ron's wand.[64] In the Celtic calendar, the vine was a symbol of passionate emotions in both extremes—happiness and wrath — and was connected to fulfilling goals and finding balance.[65]
When asked, Rowling said that if Hermione looked into the Mirror of Erised in the summer of 1997, she would have seen herself, Harry, and Ron "alive and unscathed" and Voldemort defeated, and might also "see herself closely entwined with a special person".[66]
Hermione is a playable character in the video game adaptions of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (only in duel mode), and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.[67]
In the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for PC, Peeves refers to Hermione as "Grunge". He always uses the last names for his insulting versions in the games, producing: Potter = Potty, Weasley = Weasel, and Granger = Grunge.
In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, Hermione has the ability to control Crookshanks and translate ancient runes since first year, rather than third year.
A variant of Hermione is available in the "Downloadable Character Pack" DLC for LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7. The variant is called "Hermione (Pink Dress)" because it portrays Hermione wearing the pink dress she wore to the Yule Ball in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
In the books, several times Ron and Hermione repeat phrases said by one another; for example, when Hermione, in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, wanted to produce fire in order to destroy the Devil's Snare, Ron tells her: "Are you a witch or not?" meaning that they could make fire by their wands. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Ron expressed regret for not having Crookshanks there to stop the Whomping Willow and Hermione told him, "Are you a wizard or not?" leading Ron to levitate a stick into the tree's weak spot. Furthermore, during the Battle of the Seven Potters, Tonks said Ron was amazing, having defeated many Death Eaters. When Hermione looked surprised, Ron said: "Always that tone of surprise." Hermione says the same thing when Ron told her she was very beautiful, during Bill and Fleur's wedding.
Curiously, Hermione (a Muggle-born witch) is said having passed the Apparition exam and thus having obtained the Licence to Apparate,[49] whereas her best friend and future husband, Ron Weasley (a Pureblood wizard), is said having passed the Muggle driving exam, thus having obtained the Muggle driving licence.[5]
Author's comments
J. K. Rowling has said that she loosely based Hermione at the age of eleven on herself at the same age, though an exaggerated version:

Rowling has gone on to say that Hermione, Harry, and Ron are all "a bit like different parts of my personality" as well as her favourite characters, along with Rubeus Hagrid, Albus Dumbledore, Fred and George Weasley, and Luna Lovegood,[60] and that Hermione and Dumbledore were the most useful characters for exposition.[61] She also identified Hermione as "the most brilliant" of her group of friends and confirmed that "Harry needs her badly."[68] Rowling has also said that she considers Hermione to be "a very strong female character," as well as "the brightest character."[69]

Rowling has also stated that, from a feminist point of view, she is very proud of Hermione. In her words, Hermione does not "play the game" in refusing to sacrifice parts of herself as she grows from a girl to a woman. Hermione never makes Ron "feel better" by pretending to be less than she is; she always preserves who she is and waits for Ron to catch up. In general, Rowling regards her as a heroine, but isn't sexy nor entirely sexless, but a "real girl."

Rowling admitted in an interview conducted by Emma Watson for the magazine Wonderland in February of 2014 that, with hindsight, she initially had some second thoughts on the suitability of Ron as a partner for Hermione and believes that in some ways, Harry might have made a better romantic partner for her:

She went on to say that she found the attraction itself plausible, but that the combative side of it might cause problems in an adult relationship as there was too much fundamental incompatibility. However, according to Rowling, they could "probably be alright" with a bit of marriage counselling, as Ron needed to work on his self-esteem issues while Hermione needed to learn to be less critical. She concluded with the statement that just like herself, the uptight Hermione had a real weakness for a funny man. Ultimately, Rowling stated she had no regrets putting them together and stated the two balanced each other out and truly love one another.[70]
