<html><p>When Ron, Harry and Hermione apparated into Hogsmeade, intent on sneaking into Hogwarts to find an object that had once belonged to Rowena Ravenclaw, they found themselves in a trap set by Death Eaters. They were saved by Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus Dumbledore's younger brother, and owner of the Hog's Head. They discovered that they had been saved by him once before; it was Aberforth who had sent Dobby to rescue them from the Malfoy Manor after Harry saw his eye in the remaining shard of Sirius's two-way mirror. They were later also informed by Neville that Aberforth had been supporting Neville and the other DA members remaining at Hogwarts by feeding them, passing messages using enchanted coins, and generally backing them in their resistance against Severus Snape and the Carrows.

Other Order members Ron encountered were Kingsley Shacklebolt, a skilled Auror who would later go on to become Minister for Magic and who was greatly admired by Ron, Harry, Hermione, and the Weasleys; Elphias Doge, Albus Dumbledore's friend; as well as Dedalus Diggle, Hestia Jones, Sturgis Podmore, and Emmeline Vance. Emmeline Vance was killed by Death Eaters in 1996, and Podmore was imprisoned because he attempted to get into the Department of Mysteries, under the Imperius Curse, the news of which shocked and horrified Ron.

It is likely that every surviving member of the Order (except Arabella Figg, who was a Squib and unable to fight, but might have helped in another way) fought in the Battle of Hogwarts alongside Ron, Harry, and Hermione.

Etymology
Ronald is the Scottish form of the Scandinavian name Ragnvald, which was derived from the Old Norse Ragnvaldr, composed of the elements ragn, "advice", and valdr, "ruler". It is a cognate of the name Reginald, which is derived from the Germanic form of the name, Raginwald, meaning "the prince's counsellor". All these names carry the meaning of a person who acts as a trusted advisor to a person in power, much as Ron acted as a friend and confidant to Harry Potter.

In keeping with the pattern of Weasley family members taking names from Arthurian legend, "Ron" is the name of Arthur's lance in Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain. Ron is short for Rhongomyniad, which means "striker spear" in Welsh.

Bilius comes from the word "bile", as one of the four humours discussed by Ancient Greek philosophers. Yellow bile was connected to the element of fire, which is the element of Gryffindor house, and someone with an excess of it was believed to be bad-tempered, as Ron is. The English adjective "bilious" also applies to those who have an irritable temper.

J. K. Rowling named Ron after an old family friend. However, she did not think it was a good idea because people would have tracked Mr Ridley's children down.
Ron was the second friend Harry ever made, after Hagrid.
Ron's favourite sandwich type is bacon, and his least favourite is corned beef.
Ron's least favourite colour is maroon, as he said when he received his Christmas jumper from his mother. Ironically, both he and all his family have red hair, the colour that maroon is related to.
Ron is related to Draco Malfoy distantly; his paternal grandmother was a Black, who are related to the Malfoys through Narcissa's marriage to Lucius, Draco's father. They are third cousins, however it is unknown if they know of this.
Ron is portrayed by British actor Rupert Grint in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Part 2 and is one of the 14 characters to appear in all 8 film adaptations; by British actor Paul Thornley in the original West End production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.
Rupert Grint does not have a long nose, as Ron is described as having in the novels, but he does have freckles - make-up covers them and they aren't on his face, causing some fans to claim he has no freckles at all. He also has green eyes, in contrast to Ron's blue eyes. Ironically, co-star Daniel Radcliffe has blue eyes in contrast to his character's green eyes. Unlike Ron, Rupert is not particularly tall, nor does he have large hands or feet. Although, like Ron, Rupert is the tallest of the three actors however.
Just like Ron Weasley, Rupert Grint comes from a large family, has red hair, and suffers from arachnophobia. Although the Weasley's accent origin is not divulged, Rupert speaks in a combination of modern Received Pronunciation and Cockney accents.
Rupert Grint says his favourite scene is the Yule Ball scene in the fourth film, the same as his co-star Emma Watson.
Jamie Waylett plays Ron when he is disguised as Vincent Crabbe in Chamber of Secrets, as do Steffan Rhodri when he is disguised as Reginald Cattermole in Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (with no voice change) and Rupert Grint (himself) when he is disguised as "Dragomir Despard" in Deathly Hallows: Part 2. Daniel Radcliffe also plays Ron in the "Seven Potters" scene.

Daniel Radcliffe also plays Ron in the "Seven Potters" scene.
Ron was one of the few characters who was created before J. K. Rowling began writing the series, and whose name never changed from the original drafts.
Rowling described Ron's Patronus as a "really sentimental choice" on her part, since she has a Jack Russell.
Rowling has also said that if she had a Boggart, hers would likely be the same as Ron's, as she also dislikes spiders.
Throughout most of the series, Ron does not like to hear Voldemort's name spoken out loud, and as such, never says it even when Harry and Hermione do. However, he says the name three times in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, even after asking Harry and Hermione not to. The first is at the Burrow when Hermione is packing books to take with them, and Ron says, "I forgot we'll be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library". The second is at 12 Grimmauld Place when Remus Lupin tells them that Pius Thicknesse is Minister for Magic, and Ron says, "Why didn't Voldemort declare himself Minister for Magic?". The third is again at 12 Grimmauld Place when Harry has a vision of Voldemort killing a woman and her children in his hunt for Gregorovitch. Together, the three try to work out what it means and Ron says, "But according to you, Voldemort's got Ollivander locked up somewhere". Ron also said the name in The Queen's Handbag, where he jokingly says, "Voldemort's gettin' really inventive."
In the films:
Ron is shown as the one to lose his head in a crisis (early on) rather than Hermione.
Ron is well known for using the phrase, "Bloody hell" when he is surprised or frightened.

In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Ron is one of the group of four students to serve detention by helping out Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest. This differs from the book, since Neville was the fourth student (along with Hermione, Harry, and Draco Malfoy). This can be attributed to the significantly less amount of time spent on Hagrid having Norbert, along with the differing circumstances on how they were caught. In the book, Ron wasn't helping deliver Norbert because he was being treated for injuries suffered when he was helping Hagrid take care of Norbert.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Ron is dragged away by the foot instead of by the arm by Sirius Black in his Animagus form causing the leg to break instead of having Ron break it when hooking it to the Whomping Willow's root to avoid being dragged away.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Ron supports Bulgaria instead of Ireland, which is who he supports in the book (despite being a Krum fanatic at the time).
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Ron was introduced to Hagrid's half-brother Grawp at the same time as Harry and Hermione. In the book however Ron was playing in the final match of Quidditch championship during that time. This change was due to the removal of Quidditch from the film.
In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Professor Horace Slughorn refers to Ron by several names, one of which is Rupert, which, in fact, is the name of the actor who plays Ron.
In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows:
Ron is revolted by the coffee Hermione ordered for them at the Muggle café, from which we can either assume he didn't like the café's coffee or he doesn't like coffee at all. The latter is more likely since he was raised a wizard and knew little about Muggles except from possibly his father's work with Muggle objects and from being friends with two wizards/witches who were raised by Muggles
Ron was shocked that Harry and Hermione had never heard of the children's stories by Beedle the Bard wizard kids grew up with and when Hermione reminded him that she and Harry were raised by Muggles and that they had grown up with Muggle fairy tales such as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves" and "Cinderella", Ron thought the latter was an illness.

In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 it is George who walks in on Harry and Ginny kissing in the kitchen on Harry's birthday. In the book, it is Ron bursting in on them in Ginny's bedroom.
In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, Ron has the ability to control Scabbers.
The wand that Ron wields in his two full body shot posters for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 differs. In the first, the wand he is pointing is his second wand, which was taken from him prior to the film. In the second poster, he is holding the wand he obtained after the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor.
Many fans feared the possible death of Ronald Weasley, yet in 2000, Rowling seemed dismissive of these fears, stating "As if I'm going to kill Harry's best friend." Yet, when Daniel Radcliffe interviewed Rowling for a special feature on the combo pack Blu-ray edition of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Rowling stated that at a time she had considered killing one of three members of the Trio, specifically Ron. Reflecting upon this, she noted that she wasn't in a good place in her life at the time.
He is the only known Pureblood wizard who obtains a Muggle driving licence. It is unclear when Ron obtained his driving licence. However, it has to be after the Second Wizarding War and before the epilogue, which means between May 2nd, 1998 and September 1st, 2017.
Author's comments
In an interview with J. K. Rowling and Mugglenet, when asked about Ron and the Deluminator she says:

"He wasn't the most skilled, or the most intelligent, but he held the trio together; his humour and his good heart were essential."

“Ron and Hermione, however, are drawn to each other because they balance each other out. Hermione's got the sensitivity and maturity that's been left out of Ron, and Ron loosens up Hermione a bit, gets her to have some fun. They love each other and they bicker a bit, but they enjoy bickering, so we shouldn't worry about it.” -JK Rowling
