<html><p>When the seemingly lifeless body of Harry was presented to the defenders of Hogwarts by Voldemort, Ginny let out a terrible scream of anger, grief and denial that was terrible to hear. However, his apparent death spurred the defenders on, and Neville took up the Sword of Gryffindor and beheaded Nagini. With the battle restarted Ginny, Luna, and Hermione duelled Bellatrix Lestrange, the last Death Eater at that point still standing. Bellatrix was more than a match for the three, however, and fired a Killing Curse that missed Ginny by an inch. Witnessed by both her mother and Harry, the action spurred both of them to charge the Death Eater. Molly got there first and after a fantastically vicious duel, Lestrange fell to the floor stone dead. Ginny witnessed Harry's final defeat of Lord Voldemort, and was one of the first people to run and hug him. She sat with her head on her mother's shoulder during the victory celebrations in the Great Hall.[9]

Later life (1998-2020)
After the Second Wizarding War, Ginny and Harry rekindled their passionate romance. For several years Ginny was part of the Quidditch team, the Holyhead Harpies.[21] At some point she and Harry were married and her last name became Potter. She eventually retired and the couple had a family. She gave birth to three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna.[9] Ginny later became the senior Quidditch correspondent for the Daily Prophet.[21]

In her capacity as Quidditch correspondent Ginny attended the 2014 Quidditch World Cup in the Patagonian Desert. While here, she wrote several articles for the Daily Prophet using her married name, Ginny Potter.[26] Her family joined her to watch the finals of the Cup in July[27]. Ginny covered the outcome of the Brazil vs Bulgaria match live along with Rita Skeeter. The latter while in the journalists' enclosure repeatedly made corrections to Ginny's reports. This continued until shortly after the match ended, Rita remarked that her husband Harry Potter was "publicity-hungry" — just as Ginny was approaching. That last remark sailed a bit too close to home and Rita was taken "unaccountably ill" with what some called "a jinx to the solar plexus".[28]

On 1 September, 2017, Harry and Ginny escorted their children James and Albus to the Hogwarts Express, where Albus would begin his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

By 2020 Ginny was the sports editor for the Daily Prophet, while her husband was promoted to Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. By this time all three of the couple's children were attending Hogwarts. In the same year, she joined Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Draco Malfoy going back in time to save Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy and thwart Delphini's evil plans.

In the 21st century, Ginny Weasley taught the Bat-Bogey Hex to members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force who pursued an Auror profession, in order to help address the results of the Calamity.[29] In addition, as a Quidditch Star, Ginny instructed them on body control techniques upon falling off a broom, which they applied to decrease the amount of damage they can take.

Physical appearance
Ginny in her sixth year, age 16
Ginny was described as being an extremely pretty girl, who had the typical Weasley family traits: flaming red hair (which she wore in a long mane) and a freckled complexion. She was of light skin, a very petite stature, and bright brown eyes like her mother. When blushed, Ginny would go a shade of red that matched her hair. When in a highly emotional state, she was known to acquire a "hard, blazing look".[8]

It was stated that due to her prettiness, Ginny was perfectly capable of attracting a certain amount of attention from boys. In 1996, Pansy Parkinson stated that "a lot of boys like her" and that even Blaise Zabini found her "good-looking", with the additional observation that he was very hard to please when it came to the physical appearance of women. Though Blaise immediately objected to this accusation, it could still count as a testament of sorts to Ginny's beauty. Viktor Krum also stated that she was very pretty during Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding in 1997.

Personality and traits
Ginny's shyness around Harry Potter, whom she has feelings for
Ginny was a forceful, independent girl who often knew her own mind. She had an energetic, lively personality. Ginny also was known to be quick-witted, funny, and could often make others laugh even when they were feeling down.[15][10] However, when she was young and in love with Harry in the early years of their friendship, she became shy and withdrawn in his presence.[8][14] On the advice of their friend Hermione, she overcame it. She relaxed and reasserted her usual self, which was when he finally started noticing her.[9][10] One of the traits he was attracted to was that Ginny rarely got weepy.[9]

Ginny was popular during their time at Hogwarts, and was fancied by numerous boys. Her brothers: Fred, George, and Ron, often thought that she was too popular for her own good. However, Ginny was good at lying and capable of being opaque when necessary. While staying at 12 Grimmauld Place, she was taught by Nymphadora Tonks how to check if a door had been imperturbed by flicking dungbombs at it and watching them bounce away as if hitting an invisible wall. When asked by her mother who was responsible, she blamed it on Crookshanks, even though her hands were filthy at the time.[15]

Ginny standing up to Draco Malfoy in Harry Potter's defence
Growing up with six older brothers toughened her up. Ginny was not afraid to stand up to anybody, friends and foes alike. Notably, she stood up to Draco Malfoy on their first meeting in Flourish and Blotts when he insulted Harry in 1992.[8] She even stood up to Hermione in defence of Harry's use of the Sectumsempra curse.[10] Furthermore, Ginny could be harsh towards those whom she disliked. For instance, she made fun of Fleur Delacour behind her back when she first became engaged to Bill. She also hexed and crashed into Zacharias Smith when he irritated and insulted her on two separate occasions during her fifth year.[10]

Ginny was notably difficult to intimidate or frighten, as seen during her moments of standing up to Harry during his moments of rage and anger. This is particularly impressive given that Harry's rages were capable of terrifying even his best friends Ron and Hermione, who were both incredibly courageous individuals. Her courage enabled her to take part in a three-way duel alongside Luna and Hermione against the powerful and insane Bellatrix Lestrange.

Ginny was an animal lover, especially fond of cats. When Mrs Norris was petrified in her first year at Hogwarts, her brothers put her shock down to this fact, not knowing that Ginny was scared because she couldn't remember what she was doing at the time and feared that she was responsible.[8] She named Ron's owl "Pigwidgeon",[25] and was known to be able to lure Crookshanks out of hiding to play with her when she wanted.[15] In her fifth year, she finally got her own pet, a purple Pygmy Puff from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes that she named Arnold.

Magical abilities and skills
Ginny's corporeal horse Patronus, which she was able to conjure at age fourteen
Ginny was a very powerful and talented witch. She was also a naturally talented at the Dark Arts, a gifted flyer and Quidditch player. At the age of fourteen, she was able to conjure a corporeal Patronus — a very advanced piece of magic and proof of superior magical ability.[30]

Duelling: Despite being often prevented from participating in combat by her mother mainly for her young age, Ginny was a highly talented and competent duellist. She had an uncanny ability for dodging her opponents' curses due to her agility and reflexes. Ginny survived the Battle of the Department of Mysteries with only a minor injury.[15] She also fought Death Eater Amycus Carrow again during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and emerged unscathed. This was partly due to the use of Felix Felicis and partly due to her agility.[10] She later defended herself from a Death Eater during the Attack at the Burrow.[9] During the Battle of Hogwarts, Ginny fired well-aimed curses into the crowd of attacking Death Eaters. She, Hermione, and Luna also held their own against Bellatrix Lestrange, an extremely powerful Dark witch[9]
Ginny casting Reducto during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries
Defence Against the Dark Arts: As a committed and enthusiastic member of Dumbledore's Army, Ginny learned how to successfully cast numerous defensive and offensive spells successfully, under Harry Potter's expert instruction.[15] Ginny was capable of fighting numerous highly dangerous Death Eaters throughout numerous battles of the Second Wizarding War,[15][10] with her even surviving the Battle of Hogwarts,[9] showing her excellent defensive abilities.
Dark Arts: Ginny was surprisingly skilful in dark magic and with the casting of dark charms. In particular the Bat-Bogey Hex, which she was noted to be very adept with from a fairly young age.[15] This even gained Professor Slughorn's notice entirely for her "marvellous Bat-Bogey Hex".[10] Ginny was capable of casting a very powerful and impressive Reductor Curse, which helped to distract Death Eaters once.[15] She also was described to fire well-aimed jinxes at her opponents.[9]
Charms: Ginny was highly proficient in this branch of magic. In her first year, she animated "a well card to sing shrilly when opened".[8] She once used a single Scouring Charm in 1995 to clean all the Stinksap out of a compartment on the Hogwarts Express.[15] She also had highly swift reflexes with the Disarming Charm.[8] Most impressively, at the age fourteen, she was able to cast the extremely advanced and powerful Patronus Charm, which took the corporeal form of a horse.[20]
Ginny in her Quidditch uniform
Flying: Ginny eventually became an accomplished flyer and played both Chaser (which she prefers, as she likes scoring goals) and Seeker for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Despite not playing Seeker regularly, she was able to defeat Cho Chang, a seasoned Seeker. She even effectively stepped into the shoes of the extremely talented Harry Potter (although she admitted that Harry was a better Seeker than her), winning Gryffindor the Quidditch Cup in 1996 and 1997.[15][10] As an adult, Ginny became a professional Quidditch player for the Holyhead Harpies.[21] In later years, she used her experiences in the sport to instructed the new members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force on body control techniques upon falling off a broom.
Agility: Ginny was small and extremely fast, making her adept at dodging spells in combat and flying to catch the Golden Snitch at Quidditch matches. However, she sometimes could be trapped, as one time a Death Eater grabbed Ginny by the ankle.
Leadership skills: At the young age of sixteen, Ginny was able to effectively co-lead Dumbledore's Army alongside Luna Lovegood and Neville Longbottom, showing her to have been a capable and resilient leader.
Journalism: As the Head Quidditch Correspondent for the Daily Prophet following her retirement from professional Quidditch, Ginny has been shown in her articles to be a very fair and adept journalist and reporter, often composing very unbiased and accurate articles while still injecting a certain enthusiasm into her writing style. Her position as the head of this section of the Prophet shows her level of skill as a journalist and her level of responsibility while still remaining a celebrated reporter
Possessions
Ginny's wand
Wand: Ginny's wand was made from yew, with an unknown length and core. Like most wizards and witches, she purchased it at Ollivanders before beginning her education at Hogwarts in 1992.
Arnold: Ginny's Pygmy Puff, or miniature Puffskein, purchased from her brothers Fred and George Weasley at their shop, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, in August of 1996.
Broomstick: Ginny had an unknown broom which she used for Quidditch as Chaser or Seeker.
T. M. Riddle's Diary: Tom Riddle's diary was in Ginny's possession before Harry Potter destroyed in the Chamber of Secrets on 29 May, 1993. The memory that resided in the diary had begun possessing and slowly draining the life out of Ginny.
Dumbledore's Army coin: Each member of the D.A. had a coin that had numerals that changed into the time and date of the next meeting of the D.A. whenever the master coin (owned by Harry Potter) was changed. The coin would also warm up to alert the holder to the change.
Bedroom: Ginny's bedroom was where she used to sleep at The Burrow. It is located on the first floor landing. It was described as small, but bright. It also overlooking the family's orchard and was decorated with posters of the Weird Sisters and Gwenog Jones.[9]
Weasley jumper: As a member of the Weasley family she owned several Weasley Jumpers. They were made by Molly Weasley for family and friends and sent as Christmas gifts.
Yule Ball robes: Ginny wore dress robes to the Yule Ball in 1994. She was accompanied to the ball by Neville Longbottom.
Dress robes: These were the dress robes worn by Ginny to the Slug Club Christmas party on 20 December, 1996.
Bridesmaid's dress: This was the dress Ginny wore to Bill and Fleur's wedding. She was a bridesmaid along with Fleur's younger sister Gabrielle.
Relationships
Family
The Weasleys
The Weasley family
Ginny's relationship with her family was a good one, having been raised in a loving environment. She would often comfort them (especially her mother) in times of need. The only and long-waited daughter in the family, she had to deal with an over-protective mother, who tried to prevent Ginny from war meetings and in the Battle of Hogwarts, despite her previous displays of power and skill fighting alongside Dumbledore's Army at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. Nevertheless, she often helped her mother at housework and in tending wounded at hard times.

Bill, her oldest brother
Ginny appeared to worship her brother Bill, defending his choice of earring and hairstyle to their mother,[25] and initially feeling that he could do a lot better than Fleur Delacour, whom she mockingly called "Phlegm".[10] She was in shock but helped to take care of Bill when he was permanently scarred by Fenrir Greyback.[10]

Ginny got on well with Charlie, but found Percy to be a little overbearing and stuffy. She caught him kissing his girlfriend, Penelope Clearwater, during her first year at Hogwarts, and proceeded to tell her other brothers about it after her recovery from possession by Tom Marvolo Riddle's memory.[8] Following Percy's decision to turn his back on his family over their support of Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter instead of the Ministry, Ginny was furious with him and even threw mashed parsnips at him when he came to the Burrow at Christmas in 1996.[10] .

Ginny with Fred, George, and Ron
Percy tried to be a role model for Ginny and Ron, but the two youngest siblings took after Fred and George, the fun-loving twins. In temperament, she resembled the twins, Fred and George, and, like them, often teased Ron, who was closest to her in age. Some of Ginny's brothers had difficulty accepting that their little sister was popular with the opposite gender; Ginny and Ron had a particularly nasty row after Ron caught her snogging Dean Thomas, though they eventually made up.[10]

Ginny has something of a love-hate relationship with Ron, while she loves him as a brother very much and cares deeply for him, their fights are usually quite ferocious. She had no problem telling Ron off when she believed his behaviour was unreasonable and no issues with embarrassing him in public, as when she openly mocked him for his crush on Fleur and even tripped him in front of her.[10] In 1994, Ginny comforted Ron when he humiliated himself by asking Fleur Delacour to attend the Yule Ball with him, while still managing to find the situation very funny. In 1996 she and Ron had an vicious fight about Ginny kissing her boyfriend in public, it went as far as both siblings using wands and reducing Ginny to tears, something she hardly resorted to. Ron fired a hex right at Ginny but missed and if Harry had not interfered, Ginny would have retaliated.

Ginny had a humourous side and makes many jokes to keep people's spirits up very much like Fred and George; however, her relationship with them was not perfect. She got angry with them for questioning her on her dating life and while they respected her relationship with Harry, they were not above finding ways to tease them about it. She was heartbroken by the death of her brother Fred during the Battle of Hogwarts.[9]

Harry Potter
Harry Potter, husband, father of her children, and the love of her life
Simply put, Harry Potter was the love of Ginny's life. At age ten, she only briefly made his acquaintance when he boarded the Hogwarts Express with her brother Ron.[5] She developed a crush on him nonetheless when he visited the Burrow.[8] Shy and clumsy around him, Ginny confided her feelings in Tom Riddle's Diary. Her outpouring of emotions enabled Riddle's memory to take control of her. Harry eventually saved her life in the Chamber of Secrets by slaying Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk with Godric Gryffindor's Sword and destroying the diary with one of the serpent's fangs.[8] Harry saving her life served to make her more withdrawn when in his presence, barely able to speak in front of him.[14] She even sent him a singing card on Valentine's Day. 

Meanwhile, Harry was friendly toward Ginny, but did not return her romantic feelings. When Ginny was in third year Ron suggested that Harry take her to the Yule Ball, but as it turned out she already had a date. Harry, given his purely platonic interest in Ginny at the time, was not upset by this. However, Ginny was "extremely miserable" and left the common room with her head bowed, upset at the knowledge that she could have gone to the ball with her long-time crush. Ginny sought advice from Hermione Granger, who suggested that she relax in front of Harry, be true to herself, and possibly even date other boys.[10] Taking this advice, Ginny dated both Michael Corner[15] and Dean Thomas in her fourth and fifth years. Even though she dated other boys, Ginny never completely gave up on the hope that Harry would reciprocate her affections.[10]

Ginny would often defend Harry whenever she felt it was needed, such as; in 1992 when she stood up to Draco Malfoy and fiercely told him "to leave [Harry] alone". She also told off Blaise Zabini in 1996 when he insulted Harry and even stood up to Hermione, her close personal friend in defence of his use of the Sectumsempra curse on Malfoy. In 1997 she told off her then boyfriend Dean Thomas for laughing at the fact that Harry was injured by Cormac McLaggen during a Quidditch match. On 11 July 2014, Rita Skeeter remarked that Harry was "publicity-hungry" just as Ginny was approaching, and was subsequently taken "unaccountably ill" with what some called "a jinx to the solar plexus".[28] Ginny was also somewhat possessive of Harry. She was visibly displeased with the attention Gabrielle Delacour paid him, and spoke up when Harry's ex-girlfriend, Cho Chang, volunteered to take Harry to see Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem, insisting that Luna Lovegood take Harry instead. 

Ginny gives Harry his seventeenth birthday present
In Ginny's fifth year, Harry started to fall in love with her as well. His feelings had presumably been developing since the previous year. She had reasserted herself as a vibrant, witty, and independent young woman, rather than an awkward and shy little girl. They had a lot in common — both played Quidditch, both had suffered at the hands of Lord Voldemort, and both showed great strength in defensive and offensive magic. Both have also fought alongside one another on a number of occasions. In the beginning of the year, Harry was slightly disappointed when, after a summer together, he remembered that Ginny did not normally hang around the trio at school. However, he did not realise the scope of his feelings for her until he and Ron ran into Ginny and Dean kissing. After witnessing them kissing, he frequently hoped that Dean and Ginny would break up.

By the end of her fifth year, Ginny and Harry began dating after spontaneously kissing in the aftermath of Gryffindor winning the Quidditch Cup. They broke up shortly thereafter, as Harry realised that if they continued dating openly, Voldemort would seek to use her to get to him, as he had done previously. He simply could not bring himself to endanger her life while he sought a way to destroy Voldemort. Calling the break up an "act of nobility", Ginny accepted his decision, but always held onto the hope that he would return to her.[10] In spite of the break-up, their feelings for each other remained as strong as ever. On Harry's seventeenth birthday, Ginny "kissed him as she had never kissed him before," though they were interrupted by Ron, with Hermione in tow. Ron discouraged Harry from "getting [Ginny's] hopes up," mentioning that his sister was "really cut up" when Harry attempted to end their relationship. Hermione, on the other hand, seemed to be more sympathetic toward Harry and Ginny's actions.

Harry and Ginny express their love for each other during the Battle of Hogwarts
While hunting for Horcruxes, Harry would stare at her dot on the Marauder's Map for hours, hoping that she could somehow sense that he was watching over her. At school, Ginny participated in and helped lead an underground rebellion, during which she, Neville, and Luna even attempted to steal Godric Gryffindor's Sword from the Headmaster's office. They had heard that it was left to Harry in Dumbledore's will, and guessed that he needed it.[9] Harry and Ginny next saw each other shortly before the Battle of Hogwarts. 

When the battle began, Harry wanted Ginny to stay out of the fighting, but was forced to ask her to leave the safety of the Room of Requirement when he, Hermione, and Ron searched it for Ravenclaw's Diadem. As Harry prepared to be killed by Voldemort, he thought of Ginny, "her blazing looks, and the feel of her lips on his."[9] When it seemed that Harry had been murdered by Voldemort, Ginny was beyond heartbroken and screamed louder than anyone. The supposed death of her one love was enough to drive Ginny to attack the incredibly powerful Bellatrix Lestrange alongside Luna and Hermione. When the battle was over she was one of the first ones that rushed to hug Harry.

A 40 year old Harry's and a 39 year old Ginny's continuing love for one another
Ginny and Harry rekindled their romance in the aftermath of the Second Wizarding War and were eventually married. The union produced three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna.[9] All three of the couple's children were named in honour of family members, friends, and allies (most of whom they are named after are deceased). Their marriage is shown to be mature and understanding, Harry also affectionately calls Ginny "Gin", rather than her full name. It is also revealed that after the events in the Chamber of Secrets, people shut Ginny out of their lives, but Harry came to her and played a game of Exploding Snap. Ginny claims that she also felt specific love from Harry since that day and that his love for her always made her feel stronger. The two made Ginny's brother Ron and his wife Hermione the godparents to their eldest son, and Neville Longbottom the godfather to their second son. They also have several nieces and nephews.

Despite their affectionate and passionate marriage, Ginny retained her ability to put Harry in his place over his actions and behaviours, such as when she forbade him from entering Albus's room during his disappearance.

Children
Ginny's children (left to right): Lily Luna, James Sirius, and Albus Severus
After the Second Wizarding War, Ginny had three children with Harry; two sons named James Sirius and Albus Severus, and a daughter named Lily Luna. 

Lily looked like her mother and was jealous of her brothers, who were leaving for Hogwarts, exactly as her mother had been in 1991. Ginny comforted Albus (who physically resembled his father) when he was nervous about the possibility of being sorted into Slytherin house, and scolded James for teasing his brother. After James interrupted his cousin Victoire while she was kissing Teddy Lupin, Ginny noted how similar he was to Ron.

Nieces and nephews
As Ginny had five brothers who survived the Second Wizarding War, four of whom married at some point, she had quite a few nieces and nephews by 2017. Ginny's own children seemed closest to Ron and Hermione's children, whose son Hugo was the same age as Lily, and their daughter Rose was the same age as Albus.

Bill and Fleur's children were Victoire, Dominique, and Louis; Percy and his wife, Audrey, had Molly (named after her paternal grandmother) and Lucy; George married Angelina Johnson and named their son Fred after George's late twin brother, while their daughter was called Roxanne. When Ginny's son, James, discovered Victoire kissing Teddy Lupin at King's Cross Station, he proceeded to interrupt them and then run back to his family to triumphantly announce what he'd seen, prompting Ginny to compare him to his Uncle Ron.

Hermione Granger
Hermione Granger, a good friend and future sister-in-law
Hermione Granger was one of Ginny's best female friends and her confidante. Ginny was a year below Hermione in Hogwarts, and they had become close by Ginny's second year; Hermione comforted Ginny that year when the presence of Dementors upset her (Ginny was more affected than most others due to her possession by Voldemort the previous year). Hermione stayed in Ginny's room during her frequent visits to the Burrow during summer vacations.[25] Ginny was the only one that Hermione confided in when Viktor Krum asked her to the Yule Ball,[25] and the only one who knew that she had kissed him at least once.[10] Ginny also told Hermione about her teaching herself how to fly and about her relationship with Michael Corner before her family and most others were aware of either.[15]

Hermione gave Ginny advice on how to deal with her feelings for Harry[10] — advice that would lead to her going out with him and their eventual marriage. In the summer of 1996, when Hermione was staying at the Burrow, Ginny and Hermione openly disliked Fleur Delacour and criticised her together. Ginny appeared to be disgusted with her brother Ron Weasley, Hermione's love interest, when, after a fight with Ginny, Ron began dating Lavender Brown. However, Ginny was not afraid to stand up to Hermione when she felt she was wrong, for example when Hermione scolded Harry Potter for using the Sectumsempra spell.[10]

The two became sisters-in-law upon Hermione's marriage to Ron, and Hermione is the godmother of Ginny's oldest child. Ginny also had a niece, Rose Weasley and a nephew, Hugo Weasley, through Hermione's marriage to Ron.

Fleur Delacour
Fleur Delacour, her sister-in-law
Ginny did not care much for Fleur Delacour when she first arrived at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for the Triwizard Tournament in 1994. She found Fleur humourless and irritating, as she was given to complaining loudly about what she perceived as Hogwarts' many faults. Fleur often compared the school unfavourably to Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. Ginny teased Ron for his schoolboy crush on her. She also disapproved of Fleur's engagement to her eldest brother Bill, whom Ginny looked up to.

Much to Ginny's displeasure, Bill sent Fleur to live with the Weasley family for a few days. During that time Ginny took to mockingly referring to Fleur as "Phlegm," and complained about Fleur's tendency to patronise her. However, when Bill became permanently disfigured by Fenrir Greyback and Fleur indignantly defended her husband's bravery, Ginny began to recognise Fleur's admirable qualities. The two eventually got along well, and Ginny even became a bridesmaid for her wedding.

After the Second Wizarding War, Ginny had two nieces and a nephew through Fleur's marriage to Bill.

Neville Longbottom
Neville Longbottom, a good friend
Neville asked Ginny to the Yule Ball after he was turned down by Hermione, who had already agreed to go with Viktor Krum, and the two attended together as friends. When Ron suggested that she go to the ball with Harry, who had yet to find a date, she was disappointed at having missed a chance to go with him, but remained faithful to her agreement with Neville.[25] Ginny defended Neville when others laughed at him, and told him not to put himself down when he described himself as "nobody."[15] She was also quite horrified when she heard that Neville's parents, Alice and Frank Longbottom, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and become permanent residents of St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.

Ginny was among the friends who likely contributed to Neville gradually gaining confidence and courage, and, along with Luna Lovegood, the two of them maintained the strongest support of Dumbledore's Army throughout the Second Wizarding War. She and Harry remained close friends with Neville in their later years, as Ginny asked her son, James Sirius, to "give Neville their love" when Neville taught James Herbology at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[9]

Luna Lovegood
Luna Lovegood, a close friend
Ginny was friendly with Luna Lovegood, a Ravenclaw student in her year, although the two did not grow close until they were both members of Dumbledore's Army in their fourth year. Ginny referred to Luna as "Loony Lovegood" just before introducing her to Harry and Neville in 1995, but soon stood up to those who ridiculed Luna.[15][10] In return, Luna genuinely appreciated Ginny's friendship; she once mentioned how much she liked Ginny while commentating on a Gryffindor-Hufflepuff Quidditch match in which Ginny was playing Chaser.[10]

Ginny was also one of the five portraits — along with Harry, Ron, Hermione , and Neville — that Luna painted and hung from her bedroom ceiling, with the message "friends" joining them together in gold writing.[9] Luna may be one of Ginny's best female friends (along with Hermione), as Ginny was only seen with these girls during her school years. Ginny later gave her daughter Lily the middle name "Luna", implying that the two remained very close well into adulthood.[31]

Nymphadora Tonks
Nymphadora Tonks, her friend
Ginny met Nymphadora Tonks in the summer of 1995 through the Order of the Phoenix, and she and Hermione immediately struck up a friendship with the young Auror. Ginny appreciated that Tonks, although an adult, was interested in having fun. She taught Ginny how to check if a door had an Imperturbable Charm on it by flicking Dungbombs at it. She also entertained Ginny and Hermione by displaying her Metamorphmagus abilities, usually at the dinner table.

In 1996, Ginny hoped her brother, Bill, would choose Tonks over Fleur Delacour — an idea Ron seemed to find laughable. After Tonks was murdered by her own aunt Bellatrix Lestrange during the Battle of Hogwarts, Ginny duelled Bellatrix, along with Hermione and Luna, although it is unknown if Ginny knew that it was Bellatrix who had murdered Tonks. After the Second Wizarding War, Ginny and her children were very close to Teddy, the son of Tonks and Remus.

Sirius Black
Sirius Black, her friend and husband's godfather
Though Ginny first learned of Sirius in 1993 as an Azkaban escapee convicted of killing 12 muggles, she was soon made aware of his innocence through her connections to the Order of the Phoenix and his godson, Harry. She and Sirius grew closer during their mutual time spent at the Order's headquarters, and she later told Harry that she cared about Sirius as much as he did, insisting on accompanying Harry to the Ministry of Magic, where they believed Sirius was being held and tortured by Voldemort. When Sirius and four other members of the Order arrived at the Ministry to rescue Ginny and her friends, who had walked into a trap and been attacked by Death Eaters, Sirius was murdered by his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange.

Harry and Ginny were both horribly saddened by Sirius's death, and later duelled Bellatrix in the Great Hall during the Battle of Hogwarts. Ginny married Sirius's godson later and she and Harry gave their eldest son James the middle name "Sirius" in honour of him.

Dumbledore's Army
Dumbledore's Army, her friends and allies
Dumbledore's Army was an organisation founded by Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley in 1995, and led and taught by Harry Potter to oppose Dolores Umbridge, as well as offer students a place to learn and practise defensive magic. Ginny was one of the first to join, and the one who came up with calling the organisation "Dumbledore's Army," based on Cornelius Fudge's paranoid fears of Dumbledore mobilising Hogwarts students in a coup against the Ministry. She was also partially responsible for bringing several of its Ravenclaw members into the fold, as her then-boyfriend Michael Corner brought his friends Terry Boot and Anthony Goldstein with him to the first meeting.

Ginny was on good terms with most of the D.A., making them laugh with her highly accurate impression of Umbridge's signature cough and generally proving to be a skilled duellist; the major exceptions to this would have been Marietta Edgecombe, who betrayed the DA to Umbridge, and Zacharias Smith, whom Ginny once purposely crashed into after a Quidditch match, and who deserted the DA prior to the Battle of Hogwarts. Ginny also showed some wariness of Harry's ex-girlfriend, Cho Chang, when Cho wanted to take Harry to see Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem, insisting Luna take him instead. Ginny convinced her then boyfriend, Michael Corner, and his friends to join, and the DA may have been where Ginny first became friendly with Dean Thomas, whom she would date the next year.

Ginny, along with Neville and Luna, co-led the DA in opposition to Alecto and Amycus Carrow, during the 1997–1998 school year, writing slogans on walls and at one point attempting to steal the Sword of Gryffindor from Headmaster Snape's office.

Cho Chang
Cho Chang, her husband's ex-girlfriend
Ginny always held an amount of jealousy toward Cho, as Cho was Harry's first crush, girlfriend, and shared with Harry his first kiss. Despite this however, Ginny was considerate enough of her that after Harry and Cho had broken up, she eventually advised Harry that things could be mended between them if he reached out to Cho but then was interrupted by Harry clarifying that he actually wished to talk to his godfather Sirius, making this advice null and void. When Cho offered to take Harry to the Ravenclaw common room so he could see the statue of Rowena Ravenclaw and her diadem briefly before the Battle of Hogwarts, Ginny cut across her and said that Luna would take Harry to the common room instead, implying that she still felt somewhat threatened by Cho and her still present crush on Harry.

Dean Thomas
Dean Thomas, her ex-boyfriend
Ginny started dating Dean Thomas at the end of her fourth year.[15] Ginny's brother and Dean's roommate Ron disapproved of the romance, as demonstrated by his furious reaction to stumbling upon the couple kissing passionately in a deserted hallway. They appeared to be very close at first, but, according to Ginny's friend Hermione Granger, things began to get rocky as Ginny became displeased with Dean for what she perceived as over-protectiveness, as Dean constantly tried to assist her in everything.

Ginny's enthusiasm about the relationship seemed to ebb by Christmas of 1996, as she did not seem terribly eager to see Dean upon her return to Hogwarts. The couple also began to row over little things, like Dean's constant attempts to help Ginny through the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room, and they fought after Dean and Seamus laughed when Harry suffered a fractured skull courtesy of Cormac McLaggen.

Dean and Ginny on a date at the Three Broomsticks
Harry, under the influence of Felix Felicis, actually ignited the minor argument that led to their breakup when he accidentally brushed past Ginny climbing through the portrait hole; as Harry was wearing his invisibility cloak, Ginny thought Dean was once again attempting to help her, and snapped at him. Ginny clearly got over Dean soon after they broke up, as she began dating Harry soon after and admitted to him that she had never really given up on Harry. Dean took the break up much harder; he broke the glass he was holding upon witnessing Ginny and Harry's first kiss.[10]

Michael Corner
Michael Corner, her ex-boyfriend
Ginny and Michael Corner met at the Yule Ball in 1994, and began dating at the end of the school year, she used the relationship as an attempt to "move on" from Harry Potter. In 1995, she brought him and some of his friends along to the first meeting of what would become Dumbledore's Army. When the two duelled during meetings, Michael did not hit Ginny with anything, possibly because she was his girlfriend. When Michael drew unnecessary attention to the D.A. at one point, Ginny called him a "fool", though not to his face.

Ginny ended the relationship on the basis of Michael being a "bad loser," following Michael's poor reaction to Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw in a Quidditch match.[15] Michael went on to date Cho Chang, who, like Ginny, also had a romance with Harry Potter.

Hogwarts staff
Remus Lupin, her former DADA professor
Remus Lupin was Ginny's Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher during her second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Lupin comforted Ginny after her first encounter with Dementors by giving her a piece of chocolate, and she likely believed, along with many other Hogwarts students, that he made an excellent teacher. Ginny and Remus met again in 1995, at 12 Grimmauld Place, and several times after that, as Remus was a member of the Order of the Phoenix and good friends with Ginny's parents. Ginny was thrilled when he married Nymphadora Tonks, and remained close with their son, Teddy, well after Tonks and Remus were murdered during the Battle of Hogwarts.

Ginny first met Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper in 1992, during her first year at Hogwarts. Ginny seemed to be friendly with Hagrid, as they were both friends of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. At one point, Hagrid told Harry that he saw Ginny near his hut; he supposed that Ginny hoped to see Harry, and teased Harry for it. After the Second Wizarding War, Hagrid appeared to be friendly with Albus Potter, the youngest son of Ginny and Harry.

Albus Dumbledore, her former headmaster
Ginny, like many people, thought Albus Dumbledore was the greatest wizard of all time. Ginny met Dumbledore in 1992, during her first year at Hogwarts, where Dumbledore was Headmaster. Dumbledore comforted and reassured Ginny after she was possessed by a fragment of Voldemort's soul and manipulated into opening the Chamber of Secrets during the 1992–1993 school year. Ginny was one of the first people to learn about Dumbledore's death, and the only one able to console Harry afterwards. Ginny and Harry named her younger son after Dumbledore.

Ginny also happened to like Minerva McGonagall, her Transfiguration professor and Head of House. It is obvious that McGonagall could have been fond of Ginny since she was a talented witch and did not condone or tolerate bullying, something that McGonagall most likely valued.

Dolores Umbridge, her former DADA professor
Like nearly everyone else at Hogwarts, Ginny despised professor Dolores Umbridge, the ministry-appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor for the 1995–1996 school year. Umbridge was a cruel, sadistic witch who enjoyed torturing students for punishment with the use of a Blood Quill, and attempted to take firm control of the school by passing a series of Educational Decrees. Ginny became a member of Dumbledore's Army in order to oppose her, as well to learn the practical defensive magic Umbridge refused to teach in class.

Severus Snape, her former Potions and DADA teacher
During the 1997–1998 school year, Ginny, along with Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood, re-formed and co-led Dumbledore's Army in rebellion against then Headmaster Severus Snape and Alecto and Amycus Carrow, two Death Eaters who had been appointed professors at Hogwarts and enjoyed punishing students with the use of the Cruciatus Curse.

Ginny showed particular dislike for the Potions master, Severus Snape as he was a cruel and very unpopular teacher. Aside from his creepy demeanour and snide attitude toward everyone, he had always favoured Slytherins because they were in his house and her particular dislike for Snape was something she shared with her brothers and friends. She also knew that he was part of the Order of the Phoenix and when she learnt that Snape killed Dumbledore, she thought he had betrayed the Order. She was also, obviously, not happy about his tenure as Headmaster when Hogwarts fell under Lord Voldemort's control. However, near the end of the Battle of Hogwarts, she learnt from Harry that he was on their side all along. It is unknown how she acted to the revelation of Snape's true loyalties. She did allow her second son to have his middle name from Severus.

Lord Voldemort
Tom Riddle, her enemy
When Arthur Weasley got into a fistfight with Lucius Malfoy in Flourish and Blotts prior to the start of Ginny's first year, Malfoy used the opportunity to slip Tom Riddle's diary into the pile of books Ginny was carrying. Though Malfoy most likely believed the diary was simply enchanted to open the Chamber of Secrets, it was actually one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, and in fact, contained a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul.

Tom Riddle's soul communicated with Ginny through his diary, sympathising with her problems and giving her advice, which made her emotionally vulnerable to Riddle's influence. Eventually, Riddle was able to possess Ginny, use her to open the Chamber of Secrets, and free Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk to petrify several Muggle-born students (including Hermione Granger). Ginny eventually figured out what she had been doing, despite having no memory of what happened during the times she was possessed, after finding herself covered in feathers and rooster blood. She attempted to flush the diary down a toilet, but being a Horcrux, it remained undamaged and later ended up in the hands of Harry Potter.

Ginny, worried the diary would reveal to Harry things she'd written about her feelings for him, stole the diary back. Riddle possessed Ginny one last time and had her enter the Chamber of Secrets, with every intention of killing her and using her life to restore his own. Harry, however, as a Parselmouth, was able to enter the Chamber, rescue Ginny, and slay the Basilisk with the Sword of Gryffindor. He then used one of the Basilisk's fangs to stab the diary, effectively making it the first of Voldemort's Horcruxes to be destroyed.

Upon speaking with Dumbledore about the diary's remains, Ginny and her family came to learn that Tom Riddle is the original name of Lord Voldemort, much to Ginny's horror. According to herself in later years, Ginny would never forget these experiences and comforted Harry when he thought he was suffering a similar experience.

Upon time travelling to the night of her parents-in-law's murder, Ginny was horrified by her husband's transfiguration into an exact duplicate of Voldemort, showing that she still despised him passionately. In her words, she couldn't stand to see the man she loved in the face of the man she hated.

Etymology
Ginevra is the Italian form of the name Guinevere, which means "fair one". Guinevere is also the name of King Arthur's wife in Arthurian legend, famous for her affair with Arthur's chief knight Sir Lancelot. There seems to be a pattern in the Weasley family of naming members after characters in Arthurian legend. Another famous muse bearing this name was Ginevra King, a socialite who inspired F. Scott Fitzgerald's character Daisy Buchanan in The Great Gatsby. The name Ginevra is also an Italian variant of Juniper, derived from the tree or berry. Junipers were often used to represent chastity in Renaissance-period art, such as in Leonardo da Vinci's Ginevra de' Benci.[32] With links to the Welsh and Celtic history, Ginevra also means virgin. In some cultures, Ginevra can mean "white shadow, or white wave".

Ginny's married name is Potter, a very common surname of English origin.[33] It traditionally refers to the occupation of making pottery. Beatrix Potter was a well-known English children's author. Potter's Field is the name for a burial ground for the unknown or unclaimed dead, particularly soldiers and orphans; the Potter family had many members that fit that description. The Potter Box is a model for making ethical decisions developed at Harvard University. J. K. Rowling has also commented that she has liked the name since childhood, as a family that had lived near her carried this surname.[34][35]

It is stated that Ginny looked forward to attending Hogwarts, ever since Bill began attending,[8] however since Bill began attending in 1982, when Ginny was only a year old, this seems unlikely as she would have been too young to realise what was going on. It is more likely that one of her earliest memories, likely from the age of three or four, would be of both Bill and Charlie heading off to school.
Harry and Ginny share a lot in common when it comes to Lord Voldemort-they were both temporary Parselmouths, they were both briefly possessed by Lord Voldemort and they have also lost family members to Voldemort.
According to Harry Potter, her most attractive feature is her red hair.
