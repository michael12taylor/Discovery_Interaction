Fred Weasley I (1 April, 1978 – 2 May, 1998)[1] was an English pure-blood wizard, was the fourth son and the middle child, the most daring and dominant among the twins of Arthur Weasley and Molly Weasley (née Prewett), younger brother to Bill, Charlie and  Percy, and older brother of Ron and  Ginny Weasley, and older twin brother and best friend to George Weasley. Fred's first few years were marked by the height of the First Wizarding War and when Lord Voldemort fell for the first time. 

He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1989-1996 and was sorted into Gryffindor House. Both he and his twin brother were popular students, known for their sense of humour, pranks, and were also Beaters for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. In their seventh year, they joined Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter.

A born prankster and inventor, Fred left Hogwarts shortly prior to graduation to become a successful entrepreneur, alongside his twin brother, George, and opened the joke shop Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes at 93 Diagon Alley. Fred was also a member of the Order of the Phoenix; he fought in the Battle of the Seven Potters (1997) and was a commentator for Potterwatch during the height of the Second Wizarding War. Fred participated in the Battle of Hogwarts (1998), defending the castle's passageways with his twin. While fighting alongside his brother, Percy, he was killed in an explosion caused by an unknown Death Eater.

Biography
Early life (1978–1989)
The Burrow, where Fred grew up along with his family
Appropriately enough, Fred Weasley, along with his identical twin George, was born on 1 April, 1978; April Fool's Day to Arthur and Molly Weasley.[11] Fred was born first.[12][13] He was raised at his family home of The Burrow, near Ottery St Catchpole in Devon, England. In addition to his twin brother, Fred had three older brothers, Bill, Charlie and Percy, and two younger siblings, Ron and Ginny. The Weasley family was poor, but loving.

Fred and George enjoyed making mischief from a young age, and were quite a handful for their parents. It was not uncommon for explosions to be heard coming from the bedroom the two shared. They also greatly enjoyed teasing their brothers Percy and Ron. At one point, they even used their family's pet Puffskein for Bludger practice.[14] At the age of five, Fred transformed Ron's teddy bear into a giant spider, sparking his arachnophobia, after Ron broke his toy broomstick. Also around that age, he gave Ron an Acid Pop, which burnt a hole through his tongue.[15] When they were seven years old, Fred and George nearly succeeded in getting Ron to make an Unbreakable Vow until their father found them; he was so angry that Fred later said "his (Fred's) left buttock has never been the same since."[9] One Christmas, Fred and George set off a Dungbomb under the chair of their great-aunt Muriel during a family dinner. The elderly witch most likely wrote the twins out of her will for this stunt, and stopped attending Christmas celebrations at the Burrow, for which all the Weasley children were thankful.[16]

Hogwarts years (1989–1996)
First year
Fred and George during their First year at Hogwarts
Fred was educated at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1989–1996, and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. He was very popular among the Gryffindors in school, and he and George were well known for their senses of humour and pranks. The twins even set up their own joke shop in the disused bathroom on the seventh floor. Among Fred's many friends were: Lee Jordan, Angelina Johnson, Alicia Spinnet, Oliver Wood, and Katie Bell. During their first year at Hogwarts, Fred and George swiped the Marauder's Map from Argus Filch's office.[17]

Second year
In their second year, Fred and George became Beaters for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. They both used Cleansweep Five broomsticks and were so skilled at Quidditch that they were both described as being like "Human Bludgers".[5]

It was noted by Ron Weasley on the Hogwarts Express that Fred and George achieved "really good marks", at least in their early years.[5]

Third year
George playing in Quidditch match against Slytherin
Fred in the Great Hall having breakfast with fellow Gryffindors
Fred also became friends with Harry Potter in his third year, when Harry palled around with his younger brother Ron and was made the Quidditch team's Seeker. Fred and the other players believed that the addition of Harry would be a real shot in the arm to their chances of winning the Quidditch Cup. Around the Christmas holidays, Fred and George got in trouble for bewitching several snowballs to follow Professor Quirrell around, and hit him in the back of the head (they were, of course, unaware that they were throwing snowballs in Voldemort's face).

They stayed in the castle for the holidays along with their brothers and Harry, all of whom received jumpers from Mrs Weasley. The jumpers she sent to Fred and George didn't have their initials on them as Harry's and Ron's did, prompting them to call themselves "Gred and Forge". The twins also dragged Percy away from his fellow prefects, insisting that Christmas was time for family, and stole his prefect badge, much to his irritation.[5]

Fourth year
Fred, George, and Ron rescue Harry from the Dursleys
In the summer of 1992, Fred, George, and Ron rescued Harry from his relatives' home after not hearing from him during the previous summer month. They pulled the bars off his window and flew him to the Burrow in their father's Ford Anglia. While at the Burrow Fred and George came to know Harry better as they spent time flying with him. The twins soon began their fourth year at Hogwarts, and took to teasing their younger sister Ginny as she began her first year. They were trying to cheer her up, unaware that her emotional state was fragile due to the influence of Tom Riddle's Diary.

Fred, George, and others read the message about the opening of the Chamber of Secrets
That year, the Chamber of Secrets was opened and frighting messages were written on the castle walls. Rumours were circulating that Harry was responsible for it, since he spoke Parseltongue and thus might be the Heir of Slytherin. Neither Fred nor George took these rumours seriously, they found the whole thing laughable and frequently joked about it (apparently taking Harry though crowded corridors shouting, "Make way!"). They also came to Hermione Granger's defence when Draco Malfoy called her a "filthy little Mudblood", by lunging at him, only to be blocked by Slytherin Quidditch Captain Marcus Flint.[15]

Fred helped protect Harry form a rogue Bludger during Gryffindor's opening match against Slytherin. After Gryffindor won the Quidditch match, Fred went to the hospital wing with the rest of the Gryffindor Quidditch team to see Harry because Gilderoy Lockhart had removed all the bones in his arm, and congratulated him for his unbelievable flying, but not before seeing Marcus Flint yelling at Draco Malfoy for "having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing", of which he informed Harry.[15] At the end of the school year, Fred was relieved when his younger sister was saved — and delighted when she revealed that Percy had a secret girlfriend, as this was another opportunity to take the mickey out of him.[15]

The Weasleys in Egypt
Arthur Weasley had won a large amount of gold from a Ministry contest, something that was both a surprise and delight for the family. The Weasleys used the money won that summer to take a holiday to Egypt, where the oldest son Bill was working as a Curse Breaker. While there, Fred and George tried to push Percy, who had been acting even more arrogant and pompous than usual, because he learned he had been appointed Head Boy, into a pyramid. Their mother stopped them and scolded them severely. They and their brothers went in all the pyramids. They also annoyed Ginny when she couldn't go in the last one, most likely because her their mother thought her too young.[17]

Fifth year
Fred and George give Harry the Marauder's Map
In Harry's third year and their fifth, Fred and George gave Harry the Marauder's Map, as they already knew it by heart and Harry needed it in order to sneak into Hogsmeade. They also tried to cheer him up after he fainted near the Dementors that were guarding the school that year, due to Sirius Black escaping from Azkaban. Their attempt to cheer up Ron after his pet rat Scabbers went missing was not as successful, as Fred and George reminded him that Scabbers was boring.[17] That year, they also won the Quidditch Cup along with Harry.

Fred and George began inventing magical prank items the summer of 1994, starting with the Ton-Tongue Toffee, which Fred "dropped" near Harry's cousin Dudley Dursley in order to test it out, which proved to be  very successful. Fred also attended the Quidditch World Cup with his parents, siblings, Harry Potter, and Hermione Granger, and gambled all of his money on the outcome, which their father told them not to mention to their mother. When Ludo Bagman defaulted on his bet, Fred was furious, and suggested that it was "time to play dirty" like Bagman by informing the Ministry of Magic of his activities. George was against the idea, arguing that it was blackmail.

Sixth year
The 1994 Quidditch World Cup that Fred attended with his family and friends
Once at school for their sixth year (before their sixth year they attended the Quidditch World Cup with their family), George and Fred began selling, as well as experimenting with, their inventions. That year, Hogwarts also hosted the Triwizard Tournament, which Fred and George both wanted to enter, despite being underage. They attempted to fool the Age Line spell that Albus Dumbledore put around the Goblet of Fire using an Ageing Potion, but the attempt was unsuccessful, though they both thought their beards were uproariously funny.

Fred attended the the Yule Ball with Angelina Johnson
The twins began trying out and selling their products, such as Canary Creams, at Hogwarts as their sixth year began. When the Yule Ball was announced, Fred asked Angelina Johnson to attend with him, declaring it a "piece of cake" to ask a girl out. Angelina said yes and they went to the ball together. At the end of the school year, Cedric Diggory, one of the champions, was murdered by Peter Pettigrew on the orders of the newly revived Lord Voldemort, who was reborn.[18] Fred and George were surprised and very grateful when Harry gave them the thousand Galleons he won in the Triwizard Tournament in order for them to start their joke shop.[18]

Seventh year
Fred and George in 12 Grimmauld Place
In the summer of 1995, before their final year at Hogwarts, Fred, and George passed their Apparition tests "with distinction," and took to Apparating and Disapparating around 12 Grimmauld Place to surprise people, much to the displeasure of their mother. They helped clean up the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, but they also pocketed Doxies from behind the curtains (and possibly Wartcap powder) for their experiments, and spied on the Order's meetings using the Extendable Ears they invented (although most of the time the Ears proved useless as the door was often Imperturbed).

Fred and George during a D.A. meeting
Fred and George resumed testing and selling their products at Hogwarts in their seventh year, though Hermione Granger managed to prevent them from testing out Skiving Snackboxes on unsuspecting first years by threatening to tell their mother.The twins also joined Dumbledore's Army to oppose the dictatorial running of Hogwarts under High Inquisitor Dolores Umbridge, and to prepare to fight Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters.[10]

Umbridge kicked them both off the Quidditch team that year after George and Harry got into a fight with Draco Malfoy, who had penned the demeaning song Weasley is Our King to humiliate Ron, and then proceeded to insult the Weasley parents and the late Lily Potter. Fred would have participated in the fight, but was held back by three of his team-mates. The Weasleys suffered a near-devastating blow that Christmas when Arthur Weasley was bitten by Nagini, Lord Voldemort's pet snake. Fred was greatly upset by his father's injury, especially since Percy did not join his family at St Mungo's, deepening his estrangement.[10]

When the D.A. was discovered later in the school year, Albus Dumbledore took the blame and departed Hogwarts, leaving Umbridge as Headmistress. Fred and George decided that they no longer cared about getting into trouble, and that they were going to cause as much mayhem for Umbridge as possible. When the Inquisitorial Squad was formed and one member, Graham Montague, attempted to dock House Points from them, Fred and George shoved him head-first into a Vanishing Cabinet before he could finish speaking.[10]

Fred and George during their escape from Hogwarts
They set off spectacular fireworks of their own creation, Weasleys' Wildfire Whiz-bangs, which soon became best-selling products. After taking their disruptive activities easy during the Easter holidays, Fred dropped out of Hogwarts with George in a final act of rebellion against Umbridge. They left in a flourish of vandalism, chaos, and hexing members of the Inquisitorial Squad. A small part of a Portable Swamp created in the corridors by the twins was preserved by Professor Flitwick, as he saw it as a "really good bit of magic".[10]

Career as a shop proprietor (1996–1997)
Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes
The inside of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes
Initially, Fred and George's ambitions to open a joke shop had been something of a disappointment to their parents, in particular their mother, who had hoped they would seek employment with the Ministry of Magic like their father.[10] However, the spectacular success of the twins' business, Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, located at 93 Diagon Alley, immensely impressed them both and became a source of much joy and pride in their sons accomplishment.[9] What had started out as a mail-order experiment in entrepreneurship skyrocketed into a very lucrative undertaking. In fact, it was so successful that in 1996, the twins had moved out of their childhood home and into a flat above the shop; later, the twins considered buying Zonko's Joke Shop in Hogsmeade, which had closed the previous year.[9]

Fred and George standing in their new store
None of this would have been possible without the funding Harry Potter had given them in 1995.[18] For Harry's generosity, the twins allowed him to take any merchandise free of charge. In the summer of 1996 Harry, Ron, and Hermione Granger visited the shop. Fred showed Harry around, showing him the wide verity of products in the back. He also offered Hermione a Patented Daydream Charm for free after she called them "extraordinary magic", but still charged Ron for his purchases. Ron also made some rude gestures at Fred for having him pay, which, to his misfortune, Mrs Weasley saw. Fred and George also questioned Ginny on her love life and how she was moving through boys too quickly, much to her irritation.

Fred and George stay at the Burrow for Christmas
That Christmas, the twins stayed at the Burrow for the holidays. When Percy arrived with Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour, and it became clear that the two had only come so that the Minister could question Harry, Fred threw mashed parsnips at his older brother, along with George and Ginny, causing Percy to leave swiftly.[9] In 1996, Fred appeared at King's Cross Station wearing a dragon-skin coat. These are very expensive and Fred was only able to buy it due to the fact that "business was booming."

Order of the Phoenix (1997–1998)
Battle of the Seven Potters
Fred and George mocking Harry's appearance
As supporters of Albus Dumbledore, George and Fred both joined the Order of the Phoenix once they were of age. They participated in the Battle of the Seven Potters, along with their father and their younger brother Ron. Fred and George took Polyjuice Potion to become one of the "seven Potters". While in Privet Drive they also tried numerous times to lighten the mood.[16]

Once in the air a large group of Death Eaters attacked the Order members and their charges, this led to a massive sky battle. Fred flew with his father on a broomstick, it is unknown what happened to them during the battle. He was upset to learn that his twin had lost an ear due to a Sectumsempra curse at the hands of Severus Snape. There was nothing that could be done about George's ear, as it had been cursed off with Dark magic. Although initially panicked to the point of being speechless when he saw his twin's loss, as soon as George started joking about it, Fred calmed down.[16]

Wedding of Bill and Fleur
Bill and Fleur's wedding day that Fred attended
That same summer, Fred and George eagerly flirted with two "pretty French girls", who came to the Burrow to attend their brother Bill's wedding to Fleur Delacour. It is possible that these girls might have been related to Fleur. He also reminisced about his late uncle Bilius, to the entertainment of George, Ron, Harry, and Hermione.[16] Discussing how Billius used to down a whole bottle of Firewhiskey, go out on to the dance floor left up his robes and pull out bunches of flowers. It is unknown whether or not Fred was still present at the wedding when Death Eaters stormed the wedding looking for Harry Potter.

Potterwatch
When the war reached its worst point in late 1997 and 1998, Fred participated under the code names "Rodent" and later "Rapier" in Potterwatch, a radio programme hosted by his friend Lee Jordan that opposed Voldemort's reign of terror. They spread the truth about the Death Eater regime that was not being reported by the Daily Prophet or other news outlets, and encouraged the public to support Harry Potter and to protect Muggles and wizards alike who were falling victim to the Death Eaters.[16]

Battle of Hogwarts and death
Fred and George shortly before the start of the battle
Fred, along with his family and friends, returned to Hogwarts in the spring to participate in the final battle. He and George were assigned to defend the castle's secret passages by Kingsley Shacklebolt. When the Death Eaters forced their way inside, Fred fought next to his brother Percy, who had recently been reconciled with the family and combated his former boss, Imperiused Minister for Magic Pius Thicknesse, transfiguring him.

Ron and Molly crying over a deceased Fred
While fighting, Fred was killed in an explosion outside the Room of Requirement by an unknown Death Eater. One of the last things Fred heard before dying was Percy joking about resigning from the Ministry. Percy wouldn't leave Fred's side until Harry helped him move the body to somewhere safer, coincidentally behind a suit of armour. His body was later moved to the Great Hall, where family and friends then mourned over him. 

Post-mortem
His whole family, including extended family and friends such as Harry and Hermione, were devastated when Fred died. Ron and Harry came very close to forgetting their primary goal of hunting down Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes in the wake of Fred's death, being so enraged that they wished to hunt down Death Eaters to kill, with only Hermione's persuasiveness were they able to restrain themselves. Percy became extremely furious that he chased down Rookwood in an attempt at revenge, and Molly was utterly murderous when Bellatrix Lestrange mocked her of Fred's death, to the point of killing her with astounding duelling skills. The rest of the Weasley family survived to see the downfall of Voldemort and the end of the war. His twin brother George later had a son whom he named Fred in honour of his lost brother.

In the 2010s, Fred's past self appeared as a Foundable in two different instances during the Calamity. In the first, he appeared wearing a Weasley jumper with the letter F for his first name on the front, hounded by a pair of Howler Confoundables. Volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force had to cast the Fire-Making Spell in order to disperse them. Fred also appeared alongside his Yule Ball date, Angelina, trapped by a snowstorm Confoundable, which required the usage of Meteolojinx Recanto in order to dispel it and return the pair to their own time.

Physical description
Fred, similar to all the Weasley children, had a head of flaming-red hair and abundant freckles. He had a shorter and stockier build, like his brothers George and Charlie, rather than a tall, thin build like his brothers Bill, Percy, and Ron.[5] However, Fred was taller than Harry Potter, and thus was still above average height.[19]

He also has a big nose, like Molly.[20]

Personality and traits
George and Fred dragging an invisible Harry Potter as he tries to sneak to Hogsmeade
Fred Weasley was the more outgoing, daring, and sarcastic of the twins. During the rescue from the Dursleys in 1992, George picked the lock on Harry's bedroom door with a hairpin, while Fred insisted Muggle tricks were important to know, even if it was "a bit slow"[15], and "accidentally dropped" a Ton-Tongue Toffee for Dudley Dursley to find and eat. Fred concocted the scheme of trying to fool Albus Dumbledore's Age Line to get into the Triwizard Tournament, though it was unsuccessful, and was in favour of blackmailing Ludo Bagman after he defaulted on a bet, while George had reservations.[18]

Fred tended to take the ringleader role in their pranks, but was also crueller in his humour or in dealing with those he disliked[21]; for example, he and George had absolutely no compunction in forcing Montague into a Vanishing Cabinet, an act which, according to Malfoy, nearly killed him. However, it is possible that he was unaware that the cabinet was broken and thought Montague would have stumbled out of another cabinet, too confused to remember to dock points from them, as he initially was planning to do. Fred could be quite callous in dealing with the victims of his pranks, particularly his older brother Percy, but was more compassionate when he did not feel that the victim deserved it; he immediately provided Hermione Granger with bruise removal paste after she was accidentally given a black eye by the twins' boxing telescope.[9] Fred was also the first to forgive Percy when he reconciled with the family.[16]

Both he and George were renowned for their senses of humour; they were able to make people laugh and relax even in very difficult times. Neither Fred nor George took school very seriously, but they were both very talented wizards, and demonstrated their ingenuity in their inventions and their business sense in running a highly lucrative shop. They were also staunchly loyal to their loved ones and very brave,(as evidenced by their been sorted into Gryffindor) and unafraid to stand up against what they thought was wrong, whether it was Dolores Umbridge's tyranny at Hogwarts or Death Eaters.

Magical abilities and skills
Although not a high achiever academically, Fred was a very gifted and creative wizard. He and his brother were extremely skilled at charming and bewitching items. Harry Potter once expressed bewilderment as to how he and George received only three O.W.L.s each, remarking that they "really know their stuff".[10] When the twins turned seventeen, they were able to use magic outside of Hogwarts and took full advantage of this. They did everything by [magic] and frequently Apparated around 12 Grimmauld Place and the Burrow.

Flying: Fred was a highly talented Beater for the Gryffindor Quidditch team from his second year on. Oliver Wood described Fred and George as "unbeatable"[18] and Harry Potter thought that they flew like two "human Bludgers".[5] Fred was an excellent flyer and had highly precise aim, as proven in 1992, when he smashed a Bludger with exceptional aim towards Draco Malfoy, even though Malfoy had the fastest broom of the day, and Fred only a Cleansweep Five. In fact, he only missed because of Dobby the house-elf's intervention. After the twins left Hogwarts, Harry lamented that he was never able to find replacements as talented as they were for the team.[9] He also showed highly skilled control of a broomstick when escaping Hogwarts in 1995.[10]
Weasleys' Wildfire Whiz-bangs, one of Fred and George's many inventions
Charms: One of the few O.W.L.s Fred bothered to achieve was in Charms,[22] a subject he and George were extremely talented in. Their skilled spellwork was necessary for many of their magical inventions for Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Charms professor Filius Flitwick was so impressed by their Portable Swamp that he left a portion of it intact within Hogwarts.[10] Fred was also able to produce a fully corporeal Patronus in the form of a Magpie,[8] a mark of his considerable proficiency and talent in charms, given the immense difficulty of casting such an advanced and difficult protective charm.
Magical device invention: Fred was highly talented in the skill of inventing of original magical items. Along with George, Fred invented a wide variety of magical items for their shop. Some notable items include Extendable Ears, which can be used to eavesdrop on others, a series of sickness-inducing sweets,[10] and Patented Daydream Charms, which Hermione Granger considered to be "extraordinary magic". Fred and George also invented items for protection rather than pranks, such as Decoy Detonators and Shield Hats; the latter were purchased by the Ministry of Magic itself for its employees as a protection method during the Second Wizarding War.[9]
Non-verbal magic: Fred was skilled at nonverbal spells, indicating a high degree of talent and discipline with magic. He once transfigured a sprout knife Ron threw at him into a paper aeroplane with nothing more than "one lazy flick of his wand".[9]
Herbology: Along with George, Fred was highly skilled in Herbology. He presumably took it in his sixth and seventh year, as he went to sell some Extendable Ears with George before a Herbology class in their seventh year. He was even capable, along with George, with experimenting with Venomous Tentacula seeds in the production of some of their Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, showing his skill in the subject.[10]
Transfiguration: Fred was proficient it transfiguration; it was one of the few O.W.L.s Fred ever tried to achieve.[23] He was shown to be talented with transformation, given how he successfully turned a teddy bear into a spider when he was a young boy,[24] and also effortlessly transformed a knife into a paper aeroplane with one lazy flick of his wand, showing his talent in this field.[9]
Potions: As part-owner of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, Fred was quite skilled in creating new potions, most of the time with positive, humorous effects. He and Fred invented several love potions as part of their WonderWitch line of feminine products, showing his proficiency in potion-making, as love potions are known to be advanced brews.[9]
Defence Against the Dark Arts: Fred was skilled in Defence Against the Dark Arts; he achieved an O.W.L. in it and further improved his skills in Dumbledore's Army.[25] Fred's talent at defence would contribute to his ability to invent Defence Against the Dark Arts items with George such as Decoy Detonators, and to obtain rare and useful defence items such as Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.[9] Fred also joined the Order of the Phoenix at a young age, and participated in a number of its operations. He fought in the Battle of the Seven Potters and came out unscathed, and in the Battle of Hogwarts, during which he defeated a Death Eater opponent and was in charge of guarding the secret school passages, along with George.[16]
Duelling: Fred was a skilled duelist even though he only fought in the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts. He survived the Battle of the Seven Potters uninjured, and defeated many Death Eaters prior to his death in the Battle of Hogwarts, showing his excellent skills in martial magic to have participated in such violent and dangerous conflicts.[16]
Hogwarts secret passageways expert: Ever since Fred swiped the Marauder's Map from Argus Filch's office with George,[17] they had a great knowledge of all of Hogwarts grounds including the secret passageways. Fred even once commented that the Map had taught him more at school than the professors had. The twins' knowledge of the grounds were second only to the Marauders. They seemed to have memorised the Map entirely, as they gave it to Harry in his third year and still remembered everything. This knowledge allowed Fred to tell Hermione Granger where the Hogwarts kitchens were,[18] and for him and George to lead the defence of the school's secret passages during the Battle of Hogwarts.[16]
Apparition: Fred and George managed to pass their Apparition tests sometime prior to their final year in Hogwarts, apparently "with distinction". To celebrate their coming of age of being allowed to use magic outside of school, as well as making travelling a close distance easier, they both took to Apparating as often as possible, even over very short distances.[10]
Muggle tricks: Despite being pure-bloods and raised entirely in the wizarding world, Fred and George recognised the usefulness of certain Muggle abilities, and mastered several skills that they found amusing or useful, such as lock picking.[15] As such, they launched a line of Muggle conjuring tricks in their shop, "for freaks like Dad", according to Fred, even though it was not much of a seller. However one girl was impressed enough that Fred quipped that they were almost like real magic.[9] This may have been influenced by their father, Arthur Weasley, who also was interested in Muggles. This also demonstrates Fred and George's ingenuity, as not many people born into the magical world are familiar with Muggle devices or skills.
Business: As Fred co-owned Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes alongside his brother George after leaving Hogwarts, his business skills were quite good, especially as they were able to operate it through Owl Orders before they purchased the main property at Diagon Alley,[9] and when they were on the run before the Battle of Hogwarts.[16]
Possessions
Fred's wand
Wand: Fred Weasley's wand had been bought in 1989, if it was bought when he was eleven. Although it was most likely bought second-hand like many of the Weasley Family's possessions, the wood and core of Fred Weasley's wand was unknown. It is probable that the wand is most suitable for transfiguration and charm-work, due to Fred's talents and choice of subjects at Hogwarts.
Marauder's Map: Along with George, Fred "nicked" the Marauder's Map from a drawer in Filch's office, during their first year.[17] Sometime between then and 1993, he and George figured out how to unlock and erase the Map.[17] He used the map ever since until 1993, he gave the map to Harry Potter in order for him to sneak into Hogsmeade.[17]


Cleansweep Five: Fred and his twin each flew on a Cleansweep Five broomstick when they played as Beaters for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.[15] Their use of such outdated broomsticks was likely due to their family's financial problems.[15] Despite this, the twins were still very skilled in flying and as Beaters.[5]Draco Malfoy, "who could always afford the best," insulted Fred and George's vintage brooms by saying that a museum would bid for them.[15] Their brooms, along with Harry Potter's, were confiscated by Dolores Umbridge when they assaulted Malfoy for insulting their families.[10] After the twins released a Portable Swamp in defiance to the woman, they used a Summoning Charm to retrieve their brooms from her office, and used them to fly out of Hogwarts as a final act of rebellion.[10] The broomsticks created two rather large holes in Umbridge's door.[10]
Prank and joke items: Including the items that he had already made, Fred owned a large collection of magical prank items that he had bought from Zonko's Joke Shop to help with their own development and enjoyment for pranks.[5] These included Dungbombs, Dr Filibuster's Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, Boxing telescopes, and Stink Pellets.[5]
Toy broomstick: Fred owned a toy broomstick, which his youngest brother, Ron, accidentally broke in 1983. In revenge, Fred turned Ron's teddy bear into a large spider, leading Ron to become extremely arachnophobic.[24]
Relationships
Family
The Weasleys
George Weasley: twin, best friend, and partner in crime
George Weasley was Fred's twin, best friend, and partner in crime. They were about as close as two brothers can be. They did just about everything together. They often finished each other's sentences and spoke in a back and forth way that could confuse others at times. Together, Fred and George designed many ingenious pranks and shared the ambition to found a joke shop together.[9] They were also both Beaters for the Gryffindor Quidditch team and close friends with Lee Jordan.[10]

George was devastated by the death of his twin in the Battle of Hogwarts, and would never truly get over this loss. He eventually named his firstborn son after Fred.[16]

Ron, Ginny, George, and Fred in 1995
Like his younger siblings, Fred tended to look up to his older brothers Bill and Charlie. However, he and George delighted in teasing Percy, who was closer to their age and very different from them in personality. Their mother was always encouraging the twins to be more like Percy, who was responsible and academically motivated, but Fred and George thought him to be stuffy and arrogant. Thus, they frequently mocked any behaviour they saw as arrogant on his part, such as his pride in his position as a school prefect.[15]

The twins were the angriest with Percy when he became estranged with the rest of the family over their support of Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter instead of the Ministry,[10] but also seemed the most inclined to ask about him during his estrangement, as Fred asked their mother if Percy was coming home for the Christmas holidays in 1996.[9] Fred was the first to accept Percy's apology during the Battle of Hogwarts, and he and George subsequently acted as if the split had never happened. During the battle, Fred and Percy fought side by side, and Percy was devastated over his brother's death, fiercely protecting his body and furiously pursuing Augustus Rookwood.[16]

Ron Weasley, his little brother
The twins also enjoyed teasing their only younger brother, Ron. Notably, Fred transfigured his teddy bear into a spider after Ron broke his toy broomstick,[15] once nearly manipulated him into taking an Unbreakable Vow with him and George,[9] used his puffskein for bludger practice,[26] and teased him over his embarrassing crush on Fleur Delacour.[18] Fred and George sometimes pestered Ron to the point of infuriating him, such as when they mocked him for becoming a prefect, a position Ron never tried to use against them.[10]

However, they also helped Ron out, such as by giving him a copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches and aiding him in transfiguring the Weasley family ghoul to resemble Ron with spattergroit as his cover while he was hunting Horcruxes with Harry and Hermione.[16] Fred was quite close to his sister Ginny, who was similar to the twins in temperament, and sometimes joined them in teasing others, especially Ron. They were protective of her, as well, and disapproved of her love life, it is unknown to Fred that Harry and Ginny were going out during her fifth and his sixth year and then dated after the battle and then married.[9]

Following his death, Fred gained seven nieces and five nephews.

Arthur and Molly Weasley, his parents
Like most members of the Weasley family, Fred got on well with his parents. The atmosphere was generally light, relaxed and casual.

Molly Weasley was often described as the only one Fred and George were afraid of, and was often unhappy with Fred's lack of seriousness and commitment to his learning. She was unhappy with both his earning of only three O.W.L.s and desire to own a joke shop. However, Mrs Weasley loved him very much and was devastated by her son's death during the Battle of Hogwarts, on 2 May 1998 and was seen crying over his dead body.

Arthur Weasley was more laid back than his wife. While not overly supportive of Fred's wrongdoing, he seemed to encourage the trying of new things. Mr Weasley was excited when informed of Fred's adventure rescuing Harry Potter from the Dursleys and only pretended to be strict. However, he was cranky when Fred slipped Dudley Dursley an enchanted toffee. Mr Weasley was immensely saddened by Fred's death, and was seen with his wife near his dead body.

Harry Potter
Harry Potter, his friend and future brother-in-law
Fred first met Harry Potter in his third year at Hogwarts, when Harry was beginning his first year and needed help on the train; then Harry became friends with Ron. The twins became friendly with him when he joined the Gryffindor Quidditch team as their Seeker, giving them hope to win the House Cup.[5] After Harry Potter's encounter with Quirinus Quirrell, the twins were responsible for trying to send him a toilet seat to amuse him, but it was confiscated by Madam Pomfrey because it wasn't very hygienic.

The following year, Fred and George cheered Harry up when many of the students believed that he might be the Heir of Slytherin, which they scoffed at,[15] and the year after that, they gave him the Marauder's Map to help him sneak into Hogsmeade.[17] They also stood up for Harry when others doubted his claim that Lord Voldemort had returned or challenged his authority in Dumbledore's Army, and assisted him in contacting Sirius Black when he told them and Ginny of his desire to speak to his godfather.[10] Both twins risked their lives in the operation to remove Harry from his relatives' home in 1997.[16]

They seemed to regard Harry almost as another younger sibling, and were inclined both to be protective of him and teasing of him. Fred even stated that it was time for Harry to "play with the big boys" in Harry's third year when he was excluded from the Hogsmeade visit and Fred as well as George stayed behind with him. Harry was devastated by Fred's death during the Battle of Hogwarts to the point where he felt like the world had ended, though he could not bring himself to join the Weasleys' small group around his body.

He eventually became Fred's brother-in-law through his marriage to Ginny.

Hermione Granger
Hermione Granger, his friend and future sister-in-law
Fred became friendly with Hermione Granger after she became a close friend to his younger brother Ron. Although Hermione disapproved of some of the twins' antics, since she was a Prefect, she generally got on fairly well with them. They seemed to regard Hermione like a sister, due to her relationship with Ron and as she is always trying to keep them on track, despite being almost two years younger than them.[10]

They were outraged when Draco Malfoy called her a "Mudblood" in 1992, to the point of attempting to physically attack him.[15] Hermione also warned Fred and his twin brother that their Ageing Potion would not trick the age line protecting the Goblet of Fire due to the fact that Dumbledore would have thought of a foolish ageing potion in advance. They found out she was right when they were blown backwards and grew long, white beards. Fred and George also tried to get Hermione to relax, joking around with her about things such as their late uncle Bilius's penchant for making mischief at weddings.[16]

Hermione also admired the twins' cleverness and creativity in their spell work, once remarking that they could do some "extraordinary magic,"[9] though she did not agree with how they put it to use. Hermione was also one of the few people willing to stand up to Fred and George when she disagreed with them. For example, when she caught them testing sweets from the Skiving Snackbox on first-year students with Lee Jordan, she was furious, and told them off for what she considered taking advantage of innocent children. Fred and George initially scoffed at her concerns and at her ability to make them stop, but backed down when she threatened to tell their mother.[10] However, the twins did not seem to hold a grudge, as they continued to be friendly; Fred even later gave Hermione material from the joke shop free of charge.[9] She was saddened by the death of Fred, comforting a swollen-eyed Ginny.

Hermione would eventually become Fred's sister-in-law through her marriage to Ron.

Angelina Johnson
Angelina Johnson, his Yule Ball date
Angelina Johnson was a Gryffindor in Fred's year at Hogwarts, and was on the house Quidditch team with him and George. They were good friends; Fred asked her with complete confidence and rather casually to go to the Yule Ball, and she accepted nonchalantly, but with "a bit of a grin on her face".

The following year, Angelina became Captain of the Quidditch team and was annoyed with Fred and George when they were kicked off the team by Dolores Umbridge, as it hurt the team's chances.[10] Angelina did not attend Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding as Fred's date, and he flirted with cousins of the bride while there. However, the two seemed to still be on friendly terms, as they fought alongside one another during the Battle of Hogwarts.

Angelina would go on to marry George and they even named their only son after Fred, as a means of honouring his memory.[16]

Minerva McGonagall
Minerva McGonagall, his former professor and head of house
Minerva McGonagall was the Transfiguration teacher during Fred and his brother, George's years at Hogwarts. Although McGonagall was always well known for being strict and stern, but she was never shown punishing or even telling off Fred and George for their wild behaviour and many pranks. It was known however that they were good Quidditch players from a good family, and she was visibly displeased with having Fred, George, and Harry kicked off the Gryffindor Quidditch team.

McGonagall often perceived the twins as troublemakers but seemed to share their dislike of Dolores Umbridge, who was the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for a small time. McGonagall did not attempt to remove the fireworks that surfaced around the school causing great disruptions. When Fred made his legendary escape in 1996, McGonagall assisted Peeves to unscrew an overhead chandelier. It was Fred's desire that such mayhem existed.
