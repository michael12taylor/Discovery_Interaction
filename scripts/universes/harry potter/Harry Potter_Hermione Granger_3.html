<html><p>Charms: Hermione was exceptionally talented with charm-work and some of her most impressive magical feats were charms. In her first year, she effortlessly mastered the Levitation Charm in Charms class, and also quickly learnt how to cast other charms such as the Unlocking Charm and Flashing paint charm without difficulty.[3] She not only achieved an 'Outstanding' O.W.L.[32] but also received a hundred and twelve percent in her first year Charms exam.[3] Hermione enchanted her small handbag with an Undetectable Extension Charm to allow her to carry more items in the bag than physically allowed, which allowed her, Harry and Ron to survive the months spent out in the open.[11] She managed to cast the Memory Charm successfully multiple times after having only read the theory behind it, affecting Antonin Dolohov and Thorfinn Rowle even when they were subjected to the Cruciatus Curse.[40] During her sixth year, she successfully cast the Confundus Charm on Cormac McLaggen.[41] Her array of protective charms she casted outside their defended her, Harry, and Ron for almost a year while they were searching for Voldemort's Horcruxes, while several far more experienced wizards were captured within months.[11] Hermione's speciality was creating portable, waterproof fires. In her first year, she kept these fires in a jar, used them to distract Severus Snape, whom she thought was jinxing Harry's broom during his first Quidditch match, and to attack the Devil's Snare when she, Harry, and Ron searched for the Philosopher's Stone.[3] In her second year, she used her flames in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom to light the cauldron above one of the toilets while Polyjuice Potion was brewed so that Harry and Ron could interrogate Draco Malfoy about the Heir of Slytherin.[4] During the Horcrux hunt, she kept the flames in a jar to keep the trio warm during winter.[11] However, the one charm she had trouble with was the Patronus Charm, something Harry noted when she tried casting it when he, she and Ron infiltrated the Ministry of Magic, perhaps indicating she lacked the self-confidence.[24] That said, she learned how to cast the corporeal Patronus Charm in her fifth year and was the first to master the advanced spell in Dumbledore's Army under Harry's tutelage, hers taking the form of an otter.[23][24] She mentioned in 1997 that she had been practising how to use her Patronus for messaging,[11] but it is unknown if she ever actually carried this out.

Transfiguration: Hermione was particularly talented in transfiguration. She was the first in her class to succeed at transfiguring a match into a needle in their first lesson, long before any other student.[3] In 1994, she was the only one able to transform a Hedgehog to a pincushion. Hermione earned an 'Outstanding' in her O.W.L. exam, learning to vanish objects, one of its hardest spells. In 1995, she was able to vanish Harry Potter's potion after believing him to be finished with it and a kitten by mid-year - the hardest vanishment challenge of all. Hermione was very skilled at conjuration, an advanced type of transfiguration. In her sixth year, she was able to conjure a flock of canaries.[32] By the next year, she could conjure a wreath of flowers (likely with Orchideous) and a flask non-verbally. Hermione could also perform Human Transfiguration, which is noted to be very difficult and did so in 1998 to disguise Ron during the break-in at Gringotts Bank. She could also cast various other transfiguration spells, such as the Lapifors Spell, Draconifors Spell, Snufflifors Spell, Avifors Spell, Ducklifors, Pullus and Vermiculus.[42][43]
Defence Against the Dark Arts: Hermione was skilled in this subject as she was able to achieve an 'Exceeds Expectations' in her O.W.L.[32] In their first year, she mastered the Full Body-Bind Curse.[3] In their third year when she took Professor Lupin's exam, Harry saw that she did everything perfectly except for the part of fighting the Boggart.[30] Despite this aptitude, this was the one subject Harry was better than her at, something she freely acknowledged.[32] Hermione mastered all the spells taught by Harry in their fifth year in Dumbledore's Army. She mastered the Stunning Spell, Impediment Jinx, and various other offensive and defensive spells.[29] She was capable of using powerful defensive and offensive spells such as the Blasting Curse.[11] If Hermione had become an Auror she would have excelled, but she instead dedicated herself to rebuilding the wizard laws. Alongside this, in one alternative universe created by Scorpius and Albus' time-travelling experiences, she became the professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts.

Dark Arts: Hermione was not known for her ability to perform dark magic and the extent of her capacity is truly unknown, but it could be assumed given her borderline genius status that she was no slouch, as she was able to successfully cast various potent dark charms. She was able to cast the Leg-Locker Curse and Full Body-Bind Curse in her first year,[3] the Jelly-Legs Jinx in her sixth,[32] and successfully cast a Stinging Hex at a moment's notice.[11] Hermione had enough skill to come up with a very sophisticated jinx that would deform the face of a person who betrayed the D.A., which she taught to her comrades.[29] She also cast the Oppugno Jinx to send several conjured canaries at Ron Weasley in 1996, to express her annoyance and anger at him for kissing Lavender Brown.[32] Furthermore, she was able to cast a particularly powerful and destructive Blasting Curse, which she used to blast Nagini with in Godric's Hollow in December 1997; a cast so powerful that it broke Harry's wand.[11]
Hermione attending Potions class in her sixth year
Potions: Hermione was exceptionally gifted in the field of potion-making. She was able to identify potions and their effects quickly after having only read about them.[32] She was able to brew the very advanced and difficult Polyjuice Potion in second year for her, Harry, and Ron to find the truth about the Chamber of Secrets from Draco Malfoy by disguising themselves as his friends.[4] She achieved an 'Outstanding' on her Potions O.W.L. and was only one of twelve to advance to N.E.W.T.-level. Hermione was the only one in her sixth year class who understood Golpalott's Third Law, without need for further explanation and was able to compose an antidote containing fifty-two ingredients, including a chunk of her own hair. The only time she was ever out-smarted in potions was in her sixth year by Harry Potter because he was using the Half-Blood Prince's old copy of the Advanced Potion-Making textbook that was full of hints and scribbles that helped Harry excel. This frustrated her greatly.[32]
Hermione Granger handling a Mandrake in a second year Herbology class
Herbology: Hermione earned an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. in this subject, showing great talent in this field, and even studied it at N.E.W.T. level. She was particularly skilled in spells related to handling magical plants. In her first year, she saved Harry and Ron from some Devil's Snare in the Underground Chambers by conjuring Bluebell Flames.[3] She had knowledge of various different plants; for example, in her second year, she was the only one who knew what the Mandrake root was and of its potent healing and restorative properties.[4] She was also very capable of casting the Herbivicus Charm by her fourth year, in order to magically growth plants at an excelled rate.[43]
Alchemy: Hermione had read a book containing information on Alchemy and the Philosopher's Stone in her first year.[3] In her sixth year, she easily understood Golpalott's Third Law, meaning she had impressive knowledge of this very esoteric and mysterious branch of magic.[32]
Apparition: Hermione was the first in her class to Apparate successfully, achieving Apparition twice in that time and passed her test on the first attempt. According to Ron, her performance was "perfect" and the instructor praised her talent greatly.[32] While on the hunt for the Horcruxes with Harry and Ron, Hermione frequently Apparated and Disapparated the three of them using side-along Apparition, twice when they were falling through the air.[11]
Arithmancy: This was Hermione's favourite subject at Hogwarts. Considering she was one of the few people to take this subject, so she must have had considerable skill and knowledge in this field.[30] She earned an 'Outstanding' O.W.L and took the subject to N.E.W.T.-level, showing to have been exceptionally gifted in this field, given how Arithmancy is considered to be immensely difficult and complicated.[32]
Hermione healing a Splinched Ron with Dittany in 1997
Healing magic: Hermione had impressive skills in and knowledge of healing magic. She had knowledge of the Mandrake's healing properties in her second year,[4] and was able to skilfully take care of both Harry Potter's wound from fighting Nagini and Ron Weasley's splinching wound in 1997, using the medicinal plant Dittany.[11]
Study of Ancient Runes: Hermione was gifted in translating ancient runes into English. She earned an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. in the subject and took it to N.E.W.T.-level.[32] This is what later helped lead her, Harry, and Ron to the Deathly Hallows. She later translated the original copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard into English, which she published sometime before working at the British Ministry of Magic.
History of Magic: Hermione was very interested in the history of the wizarding world from a young age. Even before starting at Hogwarts, she bought several books and learned them by heart. She was one of very few students who payed attention to Professor Binns' lectures, being known to take excellent notes in the class. She earned an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. in the subject, which was hard to do,[32] considering how boring the class was said to be.
Astronomy: Hermione was known to have gained an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. in this subject, but she decided not to continue with it at N.E.W.T.-level.[32] She often helped Harry and Ron do their homework as they often didn't remember the required facts.[29]
Muggle Studies: This was one of the subjects Hermione chose to take in her third year with the aid of a Time-Turner. She was exceptionally good at it because she could bring another point of view to the classroom and the lessons, achieving a score of over 300% on her final exam in third year. However, Hermione dropped the subject after a year, as she was a Muggle-born witch and so knew a great deal about Muggles already.[30]
Care of Magical Creatures: Hermione earned an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. in Care of Magical Creatures.[32] She had no problem interacting with the Hippogriff Buckbeak in her third year,[30] but stated in her sixth that he scared her.[32] Her skills at interacting were demonstrated with her views on house-elves and her work on S.P.E.W.,[31] having a good relationship with house-elves like Dobby and Winky and encouraging Harry to treat Kreacher more kindly after he inherited him.[11] These skills allowed her to join the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures where she continued her work with S.P.E.W., working for the rights of both house-elves and other underprivileged non-humans.
Flying: Although Hermione was not particularly confident with flying a broomstick, she was at least a reasonable flyer herself, as she was able to successfully fly on a broomstick in the Underground Chambers in order to catch a Winged Key, which she did without any difficulties, being able to soar through the air proficiently.[3]
Spell creation (possibly): Hermione was highly implied to have successfully created at least one spell, a jinx that she placed upon the list of Dumbledore's Army members which, if activated, would cause the affected person's face to break out in boils that formed the word "SNEAK" and which could not be reversed by any known counter-spell. She may also have invented the Four-Point Spell, a useful spell that would make the user's wand point north to indicate direction. If so, this further shows her remarkable and outstanding skill and magical talent, as spell creation is noted to be extremely dangerous and only to be attempted by the most skilled wizards.
Intellectual giftedness: Hermione was noted to be a "borderline genius",[44] getting top scores in every class, and getting 'Outstanding' in all her O.W.L.s except Defence Against the Dark Arts. She mentioned in her fifth year that the Sorting Hat considered placing her in Ravenclaw, but in the end decided on Sorting her into Gryffindor.[32] Hermione had a mastery of logic that most wizards lacked, as she stated that "a lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic". In 1992, she was able to use logic to get Harry past a protective measure that was taken to protect the Philosopher's Stone by Severus Snape. Hermione often provided the trio with vital information when carrying out research into the various mysteries they faced. For example, she was the one to figure out through research that the monster in the Chamber of Secrets was a Basilisk and in her third year that Professor Lupin was a werewolf. However, she tended to rely more heavily on facts and information that could be proven by background analysis rather than making intuitive leaps, so Harry was generally the one to put the pieces together which explain recent events to create the final picture and willing to make assumptions where Hermione disproved ideas if there was no clear evidence for them.
Leadership skills: While Harry did the majority of leading among the trio, it was usually Hermione who kept him on track when he, Ron and herself had a task to do, and she sometimes did the same only with Ron. She also helped form and co-lead Dumbledore's Army alongside Harry. Her leadership skills were again demonstrated when she joined the Ministry, helping improve the rights of House Elves and other underprivileged magical creatures in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, and then getting promoted to Deputy Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, in which she helped eradicate the old laws which only favoured pure bloods. Despite not desiring high positions and only leading when she was forced to do so and when the time was right, she was eventually promoted to the post of Minister for Magic before 2019.
Possessions
Hermione's first wand
Vinewood wand: Hermione purchased a 10¾" vine wood wand with a dragon heartstring core in 1991. There is a pattern of vines the whole way up the wands handle. She used it until the spring of 1998, when she, Harry Potter, and Ron Weasley were captured by Snatchers, who confiscated their wands. She subsequently used Bellatrix Lestrange's wand.[11]
Bellatrix Lestrange's wand: In 1998, after the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor, Hermione lost her own wand while Ron Disarmed Bellatrix Lestrange. Harry grabbed Bellatrix's wand as they left and Hermione subsequently used it, though it didn't work well for her, as she did not win its allegiance. Hermione used this wand at least until the Battle of Hogwarts, when she fought Bellatrix with her own wand.[11]    Bellatrix Lestrange's first wand  
Bellatrix Lestrange's first wand
Time-Turner: In 1993, just before her third year at Hogwarts, Hermione obtained a Time-Turner from the Ministry of Magic in order to facilitate her attending more classes. She also used it, at the end of the school year, to save Sirius Black and Buckbeak, along with Harry Potter. Afterwards, Hermione returned the Time-Turner, returning to a normal class schedule.[30]
Charmed handbag: Hermione had a small, beaded handbag on which she placed an Undetectable Extension Charm in the summer of 1997. She used the handbag to carry supplies such as clothing, books, Dittany, and camping equipment on her, Harry, and Ron's quest to locate and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. The bag was small enough to fit in her sock, so as to not have it stolen during the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor.[11]
Dumbledore's Army coin:: The Dumbledore's Army coin was a fake Galleon created by Hermione in 1995 to inform members of Dumbledore's Army when the next meeting would take place. She used it a great deal and ensured that her spellwork was good enough to disguise the information as typical text on a Galleon.[29]
Revealer: Hermione owned a Revealer, which renders invisible ink visible. She tried to use it on Tom Riddle's diary but no ink showed up.[45] It is unknown if she still had it in her possession after 1992.
Spellbooks: Hermione came to own various spellbooks for various spells and charms that she learnt and studied throughout her Hogwarts education, for example the Expelliarmus spellbook, Glacius spellbook, Reparo spellbook, Draconifors spellbook, Snufflifors spellbook, Aqua Eructo spellbook and Herbivicus spellbook.
Dark Arts textbooks: Whilst not a Dark witch, Hermione had an extensive knowledge of dark magic and owned various books on the subject, including Magick Moste Evile, The Nightshade Guide to Necromancy, The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts, The Imperius Curse and How to Abuse It and Sonnets of a Sorcerer, which could all be found on her bookshelf in her office in the Ministry. Additionally, during the Horcrux Hunt, Hermione kept a copy of Secrets of the Darkest Art, in which she learned of the dark magic that can be used to split one's soul and how the effects of having a split soul can affect the human being as a result of using such incredible and highly dark magic.
Magical Theory: Hermione owned a copy of this Hogwarts textbook on the theory of magic, which she usually kept stored in her school trunk. She would have used this extensively throughout her academic years, particularly in her first year.[3]
Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms: This book is about magical theory. Hermione used this reference book over breakfast one morning, in conjunction with a pile of other books, to work on her Ancient Runes homework.[30]
Advanced Rune Translation: Hermione owned a copy of this book, probably because it may have been required for her lessons in 6th year Ancient Runes which she started in her third year with the aid of a time turner.[30] She was seen to be reading this book before the start of her sixth year, after her trip to Diagon Alley.[32]
Ancient Runes Made Easy: The book was on a beginners' level for Ancient Runes Hermione was seen reading it in her second year when she was thinking about taking Ancient Runes for a subject in the following next year.[4] She probably used the book in her third year when she took the subject.
Spellman's Syllabary: Hermione owned a copy of this Study of Ancient Runes which she would have used for her formal academic studies in the subject from her third year onwards at Hogwarts.
Rune Dictionary: Hermione owned a Rune dictionary, which she consulted to help her understand and translate various complex ancient runes in her academic studies.
Crookshanks
Crookshanks: Hermione obtained a ginger part-Kneazle cat Crookshanks, in 1993. Crookshanks is highly intelligent, but was not fond of many people besides Hermione.[30] It is unknown what happened to Crookshanks after Hermione left him at the Burrow in the summer of 1997 in order to locate and destroy Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes.[11] It is very likely the two were reunited seeing their strong affection for one another.
The Tales of Beedle the Bard
The Tales of Beedle the Bard: Albus Dumbledore bequeathed the original publication of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, written in runes, to Hermione. It contained a clue about the Deathly Hallows which led Hermione, Harry, and Ron to Xenophilius Lovegood, who told them about the legendary items.[11] Later in life, Hermione translated the book into English and published her translation.
An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe: This book is about wizarding schools in Europe. Prior to 1994, Hermione had read it and learned of many things, including the Durmstrang Institute's reputation for having an emphasis on Dark Magic. It is also mentioned to have information about Beauxbatons Academy of Magic.[31] Later, in 1997, Hermione considered taking this book with her as she was sorting supplies for their mission to find Voldemort's Horcruxes. It is not specified if it was one of the books she decided to bring with her when she left with Harry and Ron.[11] It is, however, unlikely as it was of no real use to them on their mission.    Hogwarts: A History (Hermione's favourite book)  
Hogwarts: A History (Hermione's favourite book)
Hogwarts: A History: Hermione often referred to this book on many things concerning Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It was her favourite book and she would often read it in her free time. Three of the main topics brought up in it talk about Apparition within the castle,[30] Muggle electronics and the ceiling in the Great Hall.[3]
The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore: Hermione Granger had a copy of this book in her possession after her visit with Harry to Godric's Hollow and their run in with Nagini disguised as Bathilda Bagshot. She picked it up as the two left the house and she read it while running and camping during her seventh year with Harry and Ron, attempting to find clues which would help her and her friends locate and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes.[11] Given her animosity towards the author, Rita Skeeter, it is highly unlikely that she kept it following the Second Wizarding War.    The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore  
The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore
Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century: This books is about prominent events in the wizarding world during the twentieth century. Harry Potter was mentioned in this book, which Hermione read before meeting him in person in 1991.[3]
Quidditch Through the Ages: Although she was not very interested in it, Hermione had read this book in her first year, which gave her some theoretical knowledge of Quidditch and Quidditch balls. She knew about the Snitches' flesh memories, something of which Quidditch players Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley did not.[3]
The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4: Hermione owned a copy of this popular Hogwarts textbook, which gave her the knowledge to study and learn various spells and charms for her fourth year of magical education at Hogwarts.[31]
Gilderoy Lockhart's card to Hermione Granger: This letter was written by Gilderoy Lockhart to Hermione in 1993, expressing his get-well wishes. Hermione hid it under her pillow in the Hospital Wing until her friends Harry Potter and Ron Weasley discovered it.[4]
Pencil case: She had a large pencil case which allowed her to keep all her quill and other writing equipment together. She is first noted to have had it in her sixth year when an argument with Ron Weasley made her wipe her wet eyes on it.<refname="HBP"/> It is, however, highly possible that she owned this object since her first year and had not replaced it since.
Hermione in her dress robes
Spellotape: Hermione Granger owned this popular brand of wizarding adhesive tape, which she once used to restrain a rogue biting copy of The Monster Book of Monsters in 1993.[30]
Dress robes: Hermione wore a set of dress robes to the Yule Ball in 1994. They were made of a "floaty, periwinkle-blue material" and were considered to be quite attractive. In 1997, Hermione, once again, wore dress robes to the Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour. They were lilac in colour and had matching shoes.[31]
Red-jewel necklace: This necklace was worn by Hermione to the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour in 1997. She wore it up until she ran away from the wedding after it was attacked by Death Eaters. It was later destroyed by Scabior when she, Harry and Ron were taken to Malfoy Manor.[11]
Hermione's Yule Ball earrings
A scarf: Hermione owned a dark purple/red scarf and wore it frequently in 1997 whilst on the run with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley during the Second Wizarding War. She left it behind on their travels during her seventh year and it was later picked up by Scabior.[46]
Yule Ball earrings: These were worn by Hermione to the Yule Ball in 1994; her fourth year, which she attended with Viktor Krum, one of the four Champions in the Triwizard Tournament at Hogwarts.[47]
A watch: This watch was worn and used by Hermione in her youth at Hogwarts. She was seen to be wearing it during her third and fourth year.[30][31]
Prefect badge: Having became a Hogwarts Prefect in her fifth year, she owned a Gryffindor Prefect badge, which she would have worn during her formal Prefect duties.[29]
Glamchops Lemongrass Hand Lotion and Moisturiser: Hermione Granger owned some bottles of these popular Muggle cosmetic products, which could be found in her bedroom.[46]
Omnioculars: Hermione along with Ron were gifted a pair of these magical Binoculars by Harry in 1994 for the Quidditch World Cup that year.[31]
Elf-Hat: Hermione made several special hats which she hoped would be worn by House elves for the 1995–1996 school year, which were unsuccessful. She later decided to wearing one herself when she went to visit Rubeus Hagrid later that school year.[29]
Licence to Apparate: Hermione obtained her Licence to Apparate on April 21st, 1997.[48] She passed her test flawlessly, according to Ron.[49]
Relationships
Family
Parents
Mrs Granger, her mother
Mr and Mrs Granger were Muggle dentists who seemed proud of their witch daughter. They appeared to be accepting of the wizarding world, as they went shopping with Hermione in Diagon Alley and allowed her to spend several holidays with the Weasley family,[4] but did not approve of their daughter using magic as a quick-fix, as indicated by their not allowing Hermione to magically fix her teeth.[31] They correspond by owl post with their daughter throughout the school year,[29] but other than one holiday in France with her parents, Hermione spent almost all of her time in the wizarding world. In 1995, she planned to go skiing with them during the Christmas holidays, but ended up going to 12 Grimmauld Place to try to cheer Harry up instead. Hermione told her parents that the reason for her cancelling was to study for exams, indicating that her parents expected her to do well in school and were probably not aware of the extent of their daughter's involvement in activities relating to the Second Wizarding War.[29]

Mr Granger, her father
To protect them during the height of the war, Hermione modified her parents' memories in 1997 to make them believe they were entirely different people, and they left the country.[11] After the war, she found them in Australia and restored their memories.

Children
Hermione hugging Rose before Rose departs for school
After the Second Wizarding War, Hermione had two children with Ron Weasley: a daughter named Rose and a son named Hugo.

Rose started her first year at Hogwarts in 2017, along with her cousin, Albus. Ron stated that Rose had inherited her mother's brains. Hermione was probably very close to Rose because she was also described as smart, yet not a complete know-it-all.

Hugo was born in 2006 or 2007. He most likely inherited his father's Quidditch skills, as he was noted to fly a lot with his cousins Albus Potter and James Potter. He also appeared to have a quiet demeanour.

Nieces and nephews
The Potter children, some of Hermione's nieces and nephews
As four of Ron Weasley's five surviving siblings were married by 2017, Hermione had quite a few nieces and nephews through her husband: Harry and Ginny had three children (James, Albus and Lily), as did Bill and Fleur (Victoire, Dominique and Louis), while George and Angelina Johnson had a son and a daughter (Fred and Roxanne), and Percy Weasley had two daughters (Molly and Lucy) with his wife, Audrey. Victoire Weasley, one of Fleur and Bill's daughters, was seen kissing Teddy Lupin at King's Cross Station, by James Potter, Hermione's nephew and godson. Hermione visited them all on many occasions. It can be assumed that she was closest with Harry's children.

Other Weasley family members
The Weasley family, her future in-laws
Because of her friendships with Ron and Ginny Weasley, Hermione became friendly with the entire Weasley family. She spent a portion of many of her summer holidays at their home of the Burrow, and attended some family outings with them, such as shopping for school supplies in Diagon Alley and attending the 1994 Quidditch World Cup with them. Arthur Weasley was fascinated by the Muggle world and thus Hermione's background, and even invited Hermione's parents for a drink upon first meeting them. Molly Weasley was fond of Hermione, though she treated her coldly for a brief time after Rita Skeeter printed lies about Hermione toying with the hearts of Harry Potter and Viktor Krum, much to Hermione's bewilderment. After Harry explained that the stories were false, Mrs Weasley once again warmed up to Hermione. Also, she and Percy Weasley were considered to be on good terms until their fight over elf rights.

Fred and George Weasley, her friends and future brothers-in-law
Fred and George Weasley seemed to regard Hermione and Harry almost like other younger siblings, teasing them as well as being protective of them. When Draco Malfoy called Hermione a "Mudblood" in 1992, the twins were outraged, and attempted to attack him.[4] Although Hermione disapproved of some of their antics, trying to use her status as a prefect to keep them in line, she still got on well with them. Hermione once argued with them that the Ageing Potion they planned on using to trick the age line protecting the Goblet of Fire wouldn't work because Dumbledore would have already thought of a foolish ageing potion. They didn't listen and tried to cross the line which resulted in them being thrown back and grow long, white beards.The only time she was notably angry with them was when they tested out their Skiving Snackboxes on unsuspecting first year students; though the twins initially scoffed at her concerns and her ability to make them stop, they backed down when she threatened to tell their mother.

However, Hermione still admired the cleverness and creativity of their spell work,[29] once remarking that they could do some "extraordinary magic," which Fred was flattered enough by to offer Hermione material from their joke shop free of charge.[32] Fred and George also tried to get Hermione to relax, joking around with her about things such as their late uncle Bilius's penchant for making mischief at weddings.[11] Hermione was devastated when Fred was killed during the Battle of Hogwarts. Hermione was not as close to the other Weasley siblings, though she was invited to Bill's wedding to Fleur Delacour in 1997.

With her marriage to Ron, Hermione became a part of the Weasley family herself.

Fleur Delacour
Fleur Delacour, her future sister-in-law
When Hermione first met Fleur Delacour, an incredibly beautiful, French, part-Veela witch, in 1994, during the Triwizard Tournament. Hermione disliked Fleur almost immediately, as she was given to fussily and loudly criticising nearly everything at Hogwarts, from the weather, to the decoration and food. The fact that Ron had a little bit of a crush on Fleur didn't help, but he eventually got over it.

Hermione, like Ginny and Mrs Weasley, was infuriated by Fleur's arrogance and constant complaining when Bill Weasley sent Fleur, his then fiancée, to the Burrow to get to know his family. However, when Fleur responded to Bill becoming permanently disfigured by Fenrir Greyback with indignant denial that Bill's appearance would in any way effect their marital plans, Hermione most likely set her feelings aside.

Despite seeming rather inconsiderate and self-centred, Fleur proved to be courageous and ultimately caring, even selfless, in her own way. She put her life in danger by posing as one of Harry's decoys in the Battle of the Seven Potters, and after the Battle of Malfoy Manor, Hermione, Harry and Ron, along with Luna Lovegood, Dean Thomas, and an injured Garrick Ollivander and Griphook, stayed with Bill and Fleur for a month at Shell Cottage, where Fleur took care of them all like a mother. Later, Fleur became Hermione's sister-in-law through her marriage to Bill Weasley, and Hermione's marriage to Ron Weasley.

Romances
Ron Weasley
Ron Weasley, the love of her life and father to her children
Ronald Weasley was, essentially, the love of Hermione's life. Although their relationship would have many ups and downs, Hermione and Ron Weasley were good friends for most of their years at Hogwarts, and of course, were best friends with Harry Potter, who was usually a mediator in their disputes. They tended to argue frequently, though they usually got over their arguments, which tended to be minor or about trivial issues, although there were a few times when it seemed as if their friendship would be irreparable. As they grew older and matured, Ron and Hermione tended to fight less often and become more in touch with their feelings for each other. Hermione sometimes had the tendency of calling Ron "Ronald". Their first major falling-out was in their third year, when Ron accused Hermione's pet cat Crookshanks of eating his pet rat Scabbers.[30]

Hints of her feelings for Ron were shown as early as their first year, when she was badly hurt emotionally when he made fun of her for not having friends due to her bookish and bossy nature. According to Neville she spent the whole afternoon crying in the loo before the incident with the troll took place. In their third year Ron saw Sirius Black standing over him with a knife, Hermione was shocked and scared the most and even cried. They were both very awkward and embarrassed at times, being insecure with their own feelings for each other. Ron was used to always being in Harry's shadow and did not want the girl he loved to be also taken from him by his best friend. Hermione was greatly offended when Ron initially didn't ask her to the Yule Ball as his partner until he got rejected by Fleur Delacour. When it is revealed Viktor Krum was Hermione's date, a jealous Ron got into a heated row with Hermione, which she ended by making clear that she would go as Ron's date in future if only he asked her as his first choice. Ron and Hermione's relationship again suffered when Ron began dating Lavender Brown in 1996, though the two reconciled after Ron was accidentally poisoned, leaving Hermione shaken. Ron's relationship with Lavender ended soon after, and both he and Hermione were more content for it.[32]

Hermione and Ron expressing their affection for each other
Hints of romantic feelings between the two could be seen as early as their second year, as Ron was particularly protective of Hermione and disgusted by her crush on Gilderoy Lockhart. Also During the second year when Malfoy insulted Hermione calling her a mudblood an enranged Ron attempted to punish him with a curse, but as his wand was broken, the curse backfired on him injuring him.[4] During the Yule Ball in 1994, Hermione was affronted by Ron's clumsy attempt to ask her to go with him, and Ron was jealous of her attendance with Viktor Krum; this jealousy would persist for years. In turn, Hermione was jealous of Ron's crush on Fleur Delacour, though expressed it in a subtler way.

In her fourth year while Harry and Ron were not in speaking terms following Harry's name coming out of the goblet of fire, Hermione defended Ron to Harry reminding him that despite him not wanting it he always gets all the attention while Ron had to live up competing with his five older brothers and Ron is always made to feel second to him.

In their fifth year, Hermione kissed Ron on the cheek before the Quidditch Tournament, to which he reacted by being "puzzled" and touching the spot where she kissed him. During Gryffindor's Quidditch try-outs in their sixth year, Hermione also Confunded Cormac McLaggen to increase Ron's chances of being made the team's Keeper. Also, Hermione became jealous (but she tried to conceal it) when Ron began dating Lavender Brown and kissing her frequently.

Ron and Hermione spending time together during the Hocrux hunt
By the summer of 1997, the two were closer than ever and "sort of" together, according to Harry. They danced together at Bill and Fleur's wedding, and were generally kinder to one another. During the hunt for the Horcruxes, Ron comforted Hermione several times by putting his arm around her, and Harry believed that they might have fallen asleep holding hands. When Harry was briefly shouting at Hermione who was confronting him aboust his fallout with Remus Lupin and Harry was shouting at her, Ron defended Hermione from Harry by angrily saying "“Don’t you start on her!” Hermione was extremely upset when Ron temporarily left her and Harry, crying often, and she was absolutely furious with him when he returned. It was also revealed, through a vision caused by the locket Horcrux, that one of Ron's deepest fears was that Hermione preferred Harry to him.

Ron and Hermione's first kiss during the Battle of Hogwarts
The two eventually made up, and Hermione initiated a kiss during the Battle of Hogwarts, when Ron suggested saving the house-elves and not ordering them to fight for wizards. Hermione, who had been a promoter of house-elf rights since her fourth year and even started her own society to help house-elves (the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare) was so delighted at Ron's unexpected display of sensitivity that she kissed him on the lips, something that was met with surprise, eagerness and enthusiasm, but caused the pair to become embarrassed after Harry asked them to "hold it in".

Some people had expected Ron and Hermione to become more than friends much sooner and Harry Potter had even thought that they would start dating in their sixth year. In the fifth year while Hermine and Harry were arguing about Harry's decision to talk to Sirius, Hermione asked Ron's advice in a manner that "reminded irresistibly of Mrs Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry’s first dinner in Grimmauld Place."  In 1997, when the Trio was captured by Snatchers and brought to Malfoy Manor, Fenrir Greyback mistakenly called Ron Hermione's boyfriend when she tried to protect him. Also, Ron screamed and yelled and was in terrible distress when he heard Hermione being tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange in Malfoy Manor. The pair eventually married and had two children, Rose and Hugo Weasley.[11]

They were rather young when they were married, and their relationship evolved over time. By the time that Hermione was elected Minister For Magic, Ron had become more the stay-at-home-dad due to the convenience it placed on their respective careers, as Ron's entrepreneurial exploits could be more easily conducted than Hermione's careers in law enforcement and eventually politics. Their combative relationship eventually subsided for a more affectionate one, as Ron was seen to kiss Hermione in public extremely often as noted by their nephew, Albus Potter. Hermione was initially wary when Ron spoke of how early they had married and was jokingly suspicious that he wanted a break from their marriage, but was deeply moved when Ron told her that he wanted to renew their vows and marry her all over again after reading about how Muggles occasionally did such a thing. Hermione was so touched by her husband's suggestion that they began to kiss passionately over her mountain of paperwork in her office. This shows how Ron had matured into a startling romantic over the years and how it helped to temper their initially rocky relationship that begun 31 years prior.

Viktor Krum
Viktor Krum, her friend and Yule Ball date
Viktor Krum, a renowned professional Quidditch player and student of Durmstrang, came to Hogwarts in 1994 for the Triwizard Tournament, in which he was a Champion. He took to following Hermione into the library, watching her and trying to "pluck up the courage" to speak to her. Eventually, he asked her to be his date to the Yule Ball, and Hermione accepted. Their arrival together caused something of a stir, given Viktor's fame and Hermione's exceptional, and rather unexpected, beauty.

Hermione was Viktor's 'hostage' during the Second Task of the Tournament. After he pulled her from the lake, Viktor told Hermione that he had never felt about someone the way he felt about her, and invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer.[31] At some point, it is alleged by Ginny Weasley during a confrontation with her brother Ron, that he and Hermione shared a kiss during that period.[32] Whether or not Ginny was just trying to get under Ron's skin or if this actually happened is unknown. What is known is that their relationship never became serious enough for her to visit him in Bulgaria, they kept in contact through letters over the years.[29] They met again at the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour in 1997, where Viktor complimented Hermione and was disappointed to learn that she had "sort of" begun a romance with Ron Weasley.[11]

Friends
Harry Potter
Harry Potter, her best friend and future co-brother-in-law
Hermione became friends with Harry Potter after they as well as Ron Weasley took down a Mountain Troll together in their first year.[3] They tended to get along very well on a day-to-day basis, though Harry occasionally became annoyed by Hermione's nagging, while she occasionally became annoyed by his lack of discipline and conviction in his schoolwork. Their only notable row was over Hermione getting Harry's Firebolt confiscated in their third year, which she felt it might be a trap. Harry and Ron reconciled with Hermione after Hagrid scolded them for their treatment of her. Harry and Hermione were quite similar in their dour, brooding tendencies in times of trouble, and often needed Ron's humour and levity to counterbalance their intense personalities.

Harry, Hermione, and Ron spent nearly all their time together during their years at Hogwarts, and shortly afterwards, Hermione led Harry through time-travel, and together they rescued Sirius Black and Buckbeak; Hermione breaking the rules of using her Time-Turner, something she admitted was incredibly dangerous, demonstrated the strength of her friendship with Harry.[30] The following year, Hermione was the only student who believed Harry when he told her he had not put his name in the Goblet of Fire, and spent much of the Triwizard Tournament teaching Harry useful spells and trying to reconcile him and Ron.[31]

While Harry and Hermione typically argued less than Ron and Hermione, they had the most philosophical and moral disagreements with one another. Ron typically deferred to Harry's opinions on important decisions, and tends to hold back when Hermione confronts Harry about them, letting them battle it out. For example, Harry and Hermione fought about how best to deal with Dolores Umbridge when she infiltrated Hogwarts, whether or not Sirius's judgement could be trusted, whether or not Harry should have tried to use Occlumency to block out his mental link with Voldemort, whether Dumbledore's past made him an unworthy leader, and whether they should have pursued the Hallows or the Horcruxes. Hermione expressed immense displeasure to Harry during the sixth year after he started obtaining better results than her at Potion by the help of the "Half Blood Prince's potions book". Harry tended to be dismissive of Hermione's opinions, and could even grow angry when she tried to argue her point, but many times realised later that she was right. For example, Harry was often dismissive of Hermione's insistence that all house-elves deserve respect and kindness, and was neglectful towards Kreacher because of his bigotry until he finally realised the horrifying nature of his enslavement.

Hermione protecting Harry, demonstrating her willingness to put his best interests first
While Harry tended to have more fun with Ron, Hermione was consistently his place of refuge when others abandoned him, from Ron's jealous withdrawal during the Triwizard Tournament, to Harry's discovery of Dumbledore's past during the war. Despite their differences, Harry and Hermione tended to support one another at the expense of others when necessary. Hermione repeatedly chose to help and support Harry in his fight against Voldemort, regardless of personal cost. Examples include breaking the laws regarding time travel in order to help him save Sirius, teaching him defensive magic in preparation for the Triwizard Tournament, blackmailing Rita Skeeter in order to give him a way to tell the public about Voldemort's return, protecting him from torture by Dolores Umbridge, and Obliviating her parents in order to go on the run with him. She notably chose to support him even when Ron did not. Smaller acts of friendship included helping him with homework and cheering him on at Quidditch games.

Harry was similarly protective and supportive of Hermione. Much like Hermione, Harry was often a place of refuge for Hermione when others leave her. Harry often comforted Hermione and showed her kindness and care when she was upset. On the occasion that Buckbeak the Hippogriff was executed, Harry consoled her as she cries.

He was also quick to defend Hermione from Cho Chang, Draco Malfoy, and others who insulted her for her looks or parentage, which showed his pride in her intellect on numerous occasions. He consistently praised her intelligence and magical skills to teachers, asked her for help in dangerous situations, and defended her against bullies. On one occasion, he even choose to side with her over Ron when was dating Lavender. But he expressed outrage when Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen.

Harry also defended Hermione physically on instinct. This showed his willingness to put her before himself as well as his unconditional brotherly love for her. For example, when Lupin turned into a werewolf and attacked Hermione and Harry in 1994, Harry shielded her from the danger.

Many people, including Ron, Cho Chang, Viktor, Krum, Mrs Weasley,, have occasionally mistaken Harry and Hermione's relationship to be a romantic one, given their closeness and expressions of physical affection, such as kisses on the cheek, staying by one another's bedsides when hurt or injured, embracing each other, and holding hands.[31][50] Harry eventually explained to Ron that he and Hermione were like brother and sister.[11] They shared similar upbringings as being only children raised in the Muggle world, and showed each other unconditional love despite their many differences and disagreements. During their time alone during the war, Ron and Harry maintained a distance with Hermione mostly crying for Ron and Harry observing Ginny's dot at the maruderer's map. They did exchange a comforting moment during their brief embrace after Harry visited his parent's grave.[51]

Hermione and Harry remained best friends into adulthood, and eventually became co-siblings in-law when Hermione married Ron Weasley and Harry married Ginny Weasley. Hermione was also the aunt and godmother of Harry's three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus and Lily Luna. They were also coworkers for many years as employees of the Ministry of Magic in law enforcement.

It is interesting to note that Albus Dumbledore's final plan to defeat Lord Voldemort, in which Harry would learn the story of the Deathly Hallows in time to use them against Voldemort, revolved not only around Harry himself, but Hermione as well. Dumbledore knew that Harry was too passionate and angry to be able to keep from attempting to become Master of Death, and so entrusted The Tales of Beedle the Bard to Hermione, so that she would learn of the Hallows' symbol first and would be able to caution and guide Harry down the path of reason.

Ginny Weasley

Ginny Weasley was Hermione's best female friend and Ginny's confidante. The two grew close when Hermione stayed in Ginny's room at the Burrow during her many summertime visits. Ginny was the only one Hermione told about being asked to the Yule Ball by Viktor Krum,[31] while Hermione was the only one who knew that Ginny had been learning to fly in secret for years.[29] She also gave Ginny advice about dealing with her feelings for Harry — advice that eventually led to the two dating,[32] and eventually marrying.
