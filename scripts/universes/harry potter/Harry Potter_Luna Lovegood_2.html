<html><p>In a deleted scene from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Luna leaves Shell Cottage to return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry tells her that it is not the same, to which Luna replies: "Neither am I."[29] This is a reference to Luna's more mature and realistic worldview following the war.
Scarlett Byrne auditioned to play Luna,[30] as did the famous Irish actress Saoirse Ronan,[31] and The Dark Knight Rises star Juno Temple.[32]
Evanna recently portrayed Luna again for one of Jessie Cave's Pindippy videos.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Luna did not show the Ravenclaw Common Room but instead shouted at Harry Potter because of his reluctance of listening to her attempts of her approach about finding Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem.
A variant of Luna is available in the "Downloadable Character Pack" DLC for LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7. The variant is called "Luna (Lion Head)" because it portrays Luna wearing her lion hat.
In Part 2 of the final film, Luna is not seen duelling Bellatrix Lestrange alongside Hermione Granger and Ginny Weasley but can be seen duelling two Death Eaters alongside an unidentified student behind Bellatrix during her duel with Molly Weasley.
IGN listed Luna Lovegood as their 12th top Harry Potter character, saying that loony-ness made her a "delight".[33]
Empire Magazine listed Luna as their 10th favourite Harry Potter character in "The 25 Greatest Harry Potter Characters".[34]
In the early drafts, Luna's name was "Lily Moon," until Rowling changed it.
Luna is the only known member of the Lovegood family whose first name is not of Greek origin, rather it is of Latin origin.
Rowling originally intended Luna and Neville to end up together. In an interview with USA Today, she stated that she "started to feel a bit of a pull between them" but added that if they were together by the end it would have "felt too neat". Additionally, she stated that "Neville would always find Luna’s wilder flights of fancy alarming, despite their close friendship."[35]
Evanna Lynch has stated that she considers Luna to be a vegetarian, as it is her belief that Luna would not feel morally right eating animals who have suffered.[36] However, Luna has eaten meat dishes in the books, such as Gulping Plimpy soup.
Author's comments
J. K. Rowling has said that the character of Luna took her by surprise, but that she was very fun to write, and contrasted her with Hermione Granger: "She's slightly out of step in many ways but she's the anti-Hermione. Hermione's so logical and inflexible in so many ways and Luna is likely to believe ten impossible things before breakfast."[37] Rowling has named Luna as one of her favourite characters.[38] Together with Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, and Draco, Luna is part of the "big seven" characters that Rowling considers to be the most major characters in the series.[39] She was also noted to be very pleased with the casting of Evanna Lynch as Luna as she had had lunch with the actress and said she was "perfect".

J. K. Rowling's favourite character was Luna Lovegood.[40]

Luna in the films
Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood
Evanna Lynch plays Luna in the films, and since Evanna is Irish, Luna has a slight touch of an Irish accent. In the films, Harry meets her at the school carriages where she is introduced by Hermione instead of Ginny. Luna's Patronus is revealed to be a Hare, this is later confirmed to be canon in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Luna is seen barefoot throughout the film because students had stolen her shoes. In addition, Luna seems to have a taste for pudding and introduces Harry to the Thestrals; she offers a young Thestral an apple, which was turned down, before offering it a bit of raw meat with an accepting smile.

She also skipped around the school. Her butterbeer cork necklace has only one cork, which she says is to repel Nargles. She also wears a beetle ring. During the battle at the Ministry, instead of being knocked unconscious, she was hit in the mouth by a Death Eater before using an unusual verbally-incanted version of Levicorpus to hurl her attacker away. When Ginny disintegrates the prophecy shelves with a Reductor Curse, Luna is so distracted by the light that she does not run away, but Neville saves her. She is then taken hostage along with all of Harry's companions but is rescued by the appearance of the Order of the Phoenix members (Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Kingsley, and Mad Eye).

In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, she states that she often sleep-walks at night and wears her shoes to bed just in case.
Lynch was a huge fan of the series before she was cast.

Luna in the games
Luna as a LEGO minifigure
Luna's role in the game is much the same as her role in the film, though we do not meet her until Harry goes to find the people who signed up for the D.A. to tell them about the Room of Requirement. The Player has to help Luna feed the Thestrals, and then she will appear in the Room of Requirement. Later in the game, Fred and George Weasley send Luna to tell Harry how to swamp the clock tower courtyard, with one of their Portable Swamps. At the end of the game, the player must help Luna find her missing objects, which are: a jumper, a newspaper, a lion mask, a pair of pink shoes, and her purse. Luna is also a playable character in the HBP game. She is a two-player duelling character and is unlocked (with Draco Malfoy) by retrieving two crests.
