<html><p>Sirius Black had a strong grudge and hatred against Barty. This was mostly because Crouch was the one responsible for sentencing him to a life imprisonment in Azkaban without a trial, denying him the opportunity to appeal his frame-up, and because of his disgust about Barty Crouch Jnr. However, his hatred of Crouch didn't stop Sirius from taking Crouch seriously for when Harry told him about Crouch's ramblings and him vanishing afterwards he instantly realised that Crouch was trying to warn Dumbledore and that the reason he vanished is because someone wanted to stop him from seeing Dumbledore. He also was knowledgeable of Crouch's tactics to catch Death Eaters and other enemies while he was Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including using the Unforgivable Curses against them. Sirius stated that despite his disdain towards him, Crouch's principles may have been right to start off with as they were fellow opponents against Voldemort at the time, although he also said that Crouch became just as cruel and ruthless as the forces he was fighting against. Sirius also knew Crouch's demeanour well enough to be suspicious over Crouch's disappearance and the rumours of Crouch's illness, knowing that Crouch would never miss a day of work for any simple reason such as sickness. Even after Crouch's death, Sirius was still resentful of Crouch's decision to sentence him in Azkaban without a trial, commenting that he was unsure he would accept an apology from the Ministry of Magic even if they acknowledged Voldemort's return.

Not much is known about Crouch's relationship with Amos Diggory, but it obviously happened to be a rather strict one. When Amos thought Crouch's house-elf Winky had conjured the Dark Mark, Crouch was offended by this and reprimanded Amos, especially since Crouch had proved and demonstrated throughout his long career that he detested and despised the Dark Arts and those who practise them.

Wizarding community
During the First Wizarding War, Crouch was the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and he fought violence with violence: he authorised Aurors the usage of the Unforgivable Curses, to kill suspects rather than capture, attack first and question later and imprisoned many without trials. It was a time when the Death Eaters were terrorising the entire community and what Barty did was seen as the only way they could be victorious. Due to his effectiveness, he was incredibly popular, rising within the Ministry to the point he almost secured the post of Minister for Magic. Even when he sentenced his own son for life in prison, the community cheered him on for giving the impression of progress. Sirius Black, on the other hand, held a personal grudge against Crouch for sentencing him to Azkaban without a trial, losing an opportunity to appeal to the frame-up he had been caught up in. Crouch also attracted political opposition from Cornelius Fudge, who was his rival for the Minister for Magic post and was jealous of Crouch's popularity.

However, after Voldemort's first downfall and sometime after Barty's son was labelled deceased in prison, his popularity within the community dropped critically, as citizens and colleagues alike were able to calm down from their savage approvals after the terror ended and they accused Crouch for being too neglectful as a father and was the reason his own son managed to fall so low. As such, Crouch's declining reputation led him to be reassigned to the Department of International Magical Co-operation once Fudge became the new Minister for Magic.

By the 1994–1995 school year, Barty Crouch received much less applause from the students than Ludo Bagman, mostly due to his appearance of a strict rule-follower, as opposed to the more cheerful Bagman. After Winky failed to prevent his son from firing the Dark Mark into the sky during the 1994 Quidditch World Cup and was in the scene of the crime along with his reputation being nearly tarnished due to his connections with the elf, he publicly fired her, causing Hermione Granger to lash out at him with disgust for his seemingly unreasonable firing of Winky. Ron Weasley, who had the least respect for Crouch among his friends, also fully lost his respect for Crouch when he learned about Barty Crouch Jnr and stopped trusting his older brother Percy as a result. Harry Potter, who was more tolerant of Crouch than his friends, also lost respect for Crouch due to these reasons and when he learnt about Crouch imprisoning Sirius Black who was his godfather. Near the end of his life, Barty's mental stability was damaged from Voldemort's subjugation and the Ministry simply classified him as insane and refused to believe the true circumstances of Crouch's disappearance and death until there was evidence of Voldemort's return the following year, showing how much Crouch's status had fallen within the society's standing.

While he disapproved some of Crouch's methods to catch Death Eaters along with his use of Dementors in the Ministry, Dumbledore was one of the few people who maintained trust in Crouch after his popularity in the Wizarding community fell as he believed Crouch's claims that Voldemort was gradually regaining his former strength and eventually used that as a platform to reform the Order of the Phoenix to fight against Voldemort after he regained power. It is unknown how the Wizarding community reacted when learning of Crouch's secret and his death after there was evidence of Voldemort's return, although given how much his status had already fallen due to the community accusing him of being a neglectful father, it is likely that while the community was shocked when learning of his death, Crouch's reputation was permanently tarnished once his past came to light, especially as it was Crouch's act in rescuing his son from Azkaban which eventually caused both Voldemort's return and the Second Wizarding War. Despite this, the Ministry still did not learn any lessons from Crouch's or Fudge's mistakes once they acknowledged Voldemort's return, with some of Crouch's misguided decisions being adopted by the Ministry under Rufus Scrimgeour's tenure as Minister for Magic, which included arresting and imprisoning innocent people like Stan Shunpike.

Etymology
The name Bartemius originates from the Biblical name Bartimaeus, who was permanently blind all his life, until Jesus healed him. Reasons for naming after a blind man may be due to the fact Bartemius was quite oblivious to his family, and specifically to his son.
The surname Crouch is a variation of the English surname Cross. This could refer to the gibbet where criminals were executed in ancient times, this word being connected to the Latin verb cruciāre, which means "to put to death on a cross", but also "to torture, torment"; and could also refer to Crouch's extreme brutality against Death Eaters, those who practice the Dark Arts, and generally speaking criminals.
Behind the scenes

Bartemius Crouch Senior as seen in Harry Potter: Wizards Unite
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Crouch is portrayed as a somewhat more cheerful and less ruthless character and a generally more likeable man. He congratulates Harry after the latter successfully completes the Second Task, but Barty Jnr, in the guise of Moody, interrupts their heartfelt conversation, asking whether Crouch was trying to get Harry into a summer internship at the Ministry. At this point, Crouch sees Moody twitch like Barty Jnr and seems to suspect that Moody is actually his son (having apparently played no part in his escape from Azkaban). Instead of arriving in Hogwarts driven half-sane and subsequently disappearing without a trace, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid later find Crouch's dead body in the Forbidden Forest.
Also in the film, Dumbledore said that it destroyed Crouch to send his son to Azkaban and he is indeed shown to be utterly crushed and emotionally devastated when his son being a Death Eater is revealed to him. In the book, however, he seemed fully willing to do it and had no qualms or regrets about it. But the truth about the accurate case on that was not revealed. Also, the film version had no mention of Crouch's or his wife's part in their son's escape from Azkaban.
Finally, because Winky was omitted from the film, his rather abusive treatment of her is also absent (which in turn eliminates the entire sub-plot of Hermione becoming a crusader and advocate for House Elf's rights).

In the film of The Goblet of Fire, Crouch was portrayed by the late actor Roger Lloyd-Pack who is best known for his roles as Trigger in Only Fools and Horses and Owen Newitt in the Vicar of Dibley. Lloyd-Pack also appears in the revamped Doctor Who series episodes Rise of the Cybermen and Age of Steel along with David Tennant (who plays Barty Crouch Jnr in the Goblet of Fire film). In the latter appearance, the respective actors' roles are reversed however, with Tennant playing the main hero and Lloyd-Pack playing a villain. Lloyd-Pack played John Lumic (ambitious leader of Cybus industries, formed his own version of the Cybermen) while Tennant played the Doctor.
Crouch is one of the very few wizards able to convincingly disguise themselves in Muggle clothes. The "impeccably crisp suit and tie" he wore at the Quidditch World Cup were so credible "that he could have passed for a bank manager", and Harry doubted that even Uncle Vernon could have spotted him.[6] Also, when Harry saw him at Hogwarts, he thought that Crouch "looked strange in wizard’s robes".[12]
In the novel, Crouch constantly refers to Percy Weasley as "Weatherby". This is very similar to Roger Lloyd-Pack's Only Fools and Horses character Trigger, who constantly refers to Rodney as "Dave". This is not seen in the film, as Percy was cut.
Due to Percy's omission, Crouch Snr took over the roles Percy had in the book of attending the Yule Ball and Second Task for the film. In the book, Crouch Snr had disappeared due to a supposed "illness", which was actually him being placed under the Imperius Curse by Voldemort and had to be hidden away due to signs of Crouch Snr being able to resist it. It was through falsified letters that Percy took over the responsibilities in Mr Crouch's place for those tasks in the book.
It is unknown if Barty Crouch attended Hogwarts and, in that case, which House he was sorted in, but it is worth noticing that he was ambitious, cunning, determinate, put his self-preservation above everything else and he was a natural-born leader; all these traits were particularly admired by Salazar Slytherin himself and pertain to his House, which is normally connected also to what Crouch Snr hated the most: the Dark Arts.
According to his own words, his grandfather had an Axminster flying carpet which could seat twelve people — "but that was before carpets were banned, of course".[6]
He was one of the few Pureblood wizards who did not care about continuing the blood line: he himself sentenced a life imprisonment at Azkaban to his only son without hesitating, which generally means a conviction worse than death.[23]
By dismissing Winky, Crouch effectively doomed himself to Voldemort's subjugation, as this prevented her from saving him or reporting to the Ministry for help.
