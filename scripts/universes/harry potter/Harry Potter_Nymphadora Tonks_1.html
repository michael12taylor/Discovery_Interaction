Nymphadora "Dora" Lupin (née Tonks)  (c. 1973–2 May, 1998) more commonly known as Tonks was a British half-blood witch and a Metamorphmagus. She was the only child of Ted and Andromeda Tonks (née Black). Tonks attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1984 to 1991 and was Sorted into Hufflepuff House. She was in the same year at Hogwarts as Gryffindor Charlie Weasley.

After leaving Hogwarts, Tonks joined the Ministry of Magic and trained to become an Auror under the watchful eye of Alastor Moody, qualifying in 1994. In 1995, she joined the second Order of the Phoenix, working undercover in the Ministry and helping to guard the Department of Mysteries. In June of 1996, she fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. At some point, Tonks fell in love with Remus Lupin, her fellow Order member and a werewolf who felt he was too poor, old, and dangerous for her and thus rejected her feelings, although he felt the same way. In the wake of the return of Lord Voldemort, Tonks was assigned to Hogsmeade as part of the Auror task force sent to guard Hogwarts. She later fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. After seeing the love Fleur Delacour held for Bill Weasley despite his injuries, she publicly declared her love for Remus.

Tonks and Remus were married in the summer of 1997. She formed part of the Advance Guard and bravely participated in the Battle of the Seven Potters. Tonks became pregnant by this time and Remus began to worry that he had passed on his werewolf condition to their son, though this proved not to be the case as the child had inherited only Tonks' metamorphic abilities. Remus, in response to this, attempted to leave Tonks, but was convinced by their friend Harry Potter to return to her. She gave birth to a son, Teddy Remus Lupin (named after her late father Edward "Teddy") shortly after Easter in 1998 and the couple named Harry the godfather. On 2 May, 1998 Tonks fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and was finally murdered by Bellatrix Lestrange, her maternal aunt and a Death Eater, a devoted servant of Lord Voldemort. Her murder was avenged by her order colleague and friend Molly Weasley. After her death, her son was raised by her mother and Harry.

Biography
Early life (1973–1984)
Nymphadora Tonks was born in late 1972 to 1973 to Edward Tonks, a Muggle-born wizard and Andromeda Tonks (née Black), a pure-blood witch and former member of the noble House of Black although she was burned off the family tree after marrying a muggle-born, which was considered a betrayal to the family. Her mother noticed that Tonks changed hair colour on the day of her birth, meaning she was a Metamorphmagus. Given her common use of the greeting “Wotcher,” which is strongly associated with London, she likely grew up in southern England.

Hogwarts years (1984–1991)
First year
The 1984 Sorting ceremony, with a pink-haired Tonks in the front
Tonks began her first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1984 and was sorted into Hufflepuff House at the Sorting ceremony. Being the daughter of the ostracised Andromeda Tonks, she was rejected by the pure-blood supremacists of the House of Black.

Third year
In her third year, Tonks took at least Divination and Muggle Studies as her elective subjects. Also in the 1986–1987 school year, at the start of the Herbology lesson on Valerian Sprigs, Tonks warned people to watch out, for she spilled some soil on the floor. When the Herbology Professor, also her Head of House, Pomona Sprout, asked fellow Housemate Penny Haywood to fetch a pail for the watering demonstration, Tonks took the time to briefly wonder aloud about which plant would be most suitable for bothering a certain "irritable, birdlike" librarian. The musing was cut short by Penny's scream, and the class realised in shock that a supposed werewolf had burst out of a plant pot. Professor Sprout took care of the situation by casting the Boggart-Banishing Spell, and introduced the class to what a Boggart was. As Professor Sprout left to report the incident to Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, Tonks asked Jacob's sibling in puzzlement about Penny's fear, implying she didn't understand why Penny's worst fear would be werewolves.

Tonks coming to the conclusion that she should stop Metamorphosing into teachers
Before the start of the lesson on "rolling" in the Flying class, Tonks chatted excitedly with Rowan Khanna and Jacob's sibling, for as third years, they would finally get to go to Hogsmeade. She was especially looking forward to visiting Zonko's Joke Shop and Honeydukes, along with having Butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks Inn. After the lesson, she revealed she had crashed into the Owlery, the Astronomy Tower, the Whomping Willow, and Rubeus Hagrid's garden, but that apparently was a few crashes fewer than her average. Tonks later revealed that she had often gotten detentions for turning into teachers using her Metamorphmagus abilities.

When revisiting an old lesson in Herbology, re-potting baby Mandrakes, Tonks forgot her earmuffs and resorted to rolling up some Jelly Slugs and sticking them in her ears, which proved to be sub-optimal, for though she was not affected by the screaming Mandrakes; after class, she also could not properly converse with Jacob's sibling, due to being unable to hear.

Fourth year
At some point, Tonks taught herself the highly advanced Patronus Charm. She later saved Jacob's sibling from a Dementor, after Penny was knocked out by one. She was then able to teach Jacob's sibling and Merula Snyde the same spell.

One night in her fourth year, Tonks took the biggest Venomous Tentacula from Sprout's greenhouse. She attempted to put it under Filch's desk, but fell on her face on the way, accidentally tossing it into the Potions Classroom. The plant ended up grabbing Professor Severus Snape. He and Sprout agreed to give Tonks daily detention until the end of her school days, but Sprout gave her the chance to not get detention if she managed to pass a special Herbology test.

Tonks studied for the test in the Hogwarts Library, where she came across Jacob's sibling. Tonks told them what had happened and the two agreed to study together.

Fifth year
Professor Sprout didn't make her one of Hufflepuff's prefects in her fifth year because she lacked the ability to behave properly.

Despite her behaviour, Tonks achieved good marks on her exams and qualified for Auror training when she left school in 1991. This means that she took Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, and Herbology at the least in her sixth and seventh year. She earned 'Outstanding' or 'Exceeds Expectations' on all of her N.E.W.T.s.

Sixth year
During her sixth year, Tonks proceeded to take N.E.W.T. level classes in Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, Herbology, Divination and Muggle Studies. Sometime that year, she became a founding member of the Circle of Khanna, a group devoted to avenging Rowan Khanna and locating the final cursed vault. It was at the group's first meeting in the Hog's Head Inn that she learned of the malevolent organisation R and its motives to locate the final Cursed Vault before them.

She joined Jacob's sibling on his mission to infiltrate R's meeting, using her Metamorphmagus abilities to turn into a dark witch. She kept an eye on the meeting, inducing the suspicion of the Wizard in white robes. However she managed to get through the meeting, until Patricia Rakepick apparated into the scene and attacked Jacob's sibling. She duelled the Wizard in white robes and an unidentified dark witch alone, and managed to hold her ground, even managing to disarm and bind the Wizard in white robes in ropes.

Seventh year
During the 1990–1991 school year, Tonks participated in the Ministry of Magic student programme, a Ministry-sponsored program that allowed seventh-year Hogwarts students to experience various careers first-hand. She and Jacob's sibling were initially assigned to the Auror Office under Alastor Moody. During her first assignments, she and her friend helped Moody track down a rogue alchemist whose fake panacea had given several victims boils.

Career as an Auror (1992–1995)
After passing a series of character tests that examine practical skills and how well candidates react under pressure, Tonks underwent three years of formal Auror training also under the tutelage of Alastor Moody. Her natural metamorphic abilities allowed her to easily pass the Concealment and Disguise portion of the training without doing any work or study at all. However, Tonks' clumsiness gave her trouble with the Stealth and Tracking portion of the course. She admitted to Harry Potter that she almost failed, as she had a habit of breaking items.  

Tonks qualified fully as an Auror in 1994, she was one of the last ones taken on. According to her father, she had been through worse experiences than many of her next battles. 

Second Wizarding War (1995–1998)
Tonks with the Advance Guard at 4 Privet Drive
With the return of Lord Voldemort in 1995, Tonks was one of the few Ministry employees to be convinced of the truth, rather than accepting the Ministry lie that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named hadn't returned. She joined the reconstituted Order of the Phoenix, and, alongside Kingsley Shacklebolt, worked as a covert operative inside the Ministry, feeding the Order information. Tonks had to be careful around the Ministry, though, as indiscreet actions would have seen her lose her position as an Auror. She also took shifts guarding Harry Potter's prophecy in the Department of Mysteries, along with other members of the Order. She was considered a considerable asset to the Order.

The Advance Guard inside 4 Privet Drive, preparing to escort Harry Potter to safety
In the summer of 1995, Tonks was part of the Order's Advance Guard sent to escort Harry from 4 Privet Drive to 12 Grimmauld Place, after his encounter with Dementors in Little Whinging. In order to lure the Dursleys from the house so they could retrieve Harry Potter, she sent a letter via the Muggle post, informing them that they had been short-listed in the "All-England Best Kept Suburban Lawn Competition." With the Dursleys out of the way, the Advance Guard arrived to protect Harry during the journey to London. Tonks befriended the young wizard immediately and helped him pack his trunk, although she was not very good with household spells, something at which her mother excelled. She was impressed by his Firebolt broomstick. During the broomstick flight to Grimmauld Place, Tonks flew in the lead of the formation and convinced Moody to land immediately instead of doubling back.

Tonks as a member of the Order task force accompanying Harry to the Hogwarts Express
After rescuing Harry from the Dursleys, Tonks was extremely busy at the Ministry, and the situation wasn't helped by Rufus Scrimgeour asking awkward questions, possibly due to her association with Mad-Eye Moody. Still, she found the time to attend the party at Grimmauld Place for Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger to congratulate them on becoming prefects. She was later part of the Order task force, disguised as an old woman, that escorted Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Fred, and George to King's Cross Station, so they could catch the Hogwarts Express.

At Christmas of the same year, Tonks accompanied Harry, Hermione, and the Weasleys to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries to visit Arthur Weasley, who had been attacked by Lord Voldemort's snake, Nagini. She gave Harry a miniature replica of his Firebolt as a Christmas present. Tonks, along with Remus Lupin, escorted Harry, Hermione, and the Weasley children back to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus to start the new term.

Battle of the Department of Mysteries
Tonks arrives in the Death Chamber of the Department of Mysteries
18 June 1996, Tonks was part of the Order force that went to rescue Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Neville Longbottom, and Luna Lovegood from the Department of Mysteries, along with Mad-Eye, Kingsley, her cousin Sirius Black, and Lupin. During the battle with the Death Eaters, she shot a Stunning Spell at Lucius Malfoy and duelled her aunt, Bellatrix Lestrange, who proved too strong for Tonks. She was severely injured and knocked unconscious in the fight, to the point that Moody tried to revive her. Later, Tonks was saddened when Sirius died in the fight.

Following the conclusion of the battle, Tonks needed to spend some time at St Mungo's to recuperate. Fortunately, she was released in time to join several Order members at King's Cross station to confront the Dursleys over their treatment of Harry.

Protecting Hogwarts
Tonks visiting The Burrow along with Remus Lupin
Tonks continued to serve the Order of the Phoenix, but she had become withdrawn and depressed. The change in personality — and her seeming difficulties in controlling her metamorphic abilities — was noted by those around her. Her physical changes included her hair becoming mousy brown and lank, while her body became thinner. Some, including Hermione and Harry, thought the change in her mood and appearance was caused by the death of her cousin, Sirius, since she had been fighting his murderer, Bellatrix, and had failed to stop her, and thus might be feeling guilty.

However, there was more than one reason for it and yet another cause of her depression was her love for Remus Lupin, who became her close friend over a year. One night when they lay in hiding outside a known Death Eater's house, she revealed her feelings. However, he felt a relationship with her would be disastrous for her, as he was a werewolf, too old and poor for her, so he started to volunteer in dangerous, long-term missions in order to keep distance between them. Tonks confided her feelings to Molly Weasley, and was often at the Burrow for "tea and sympathy". Her feelings even caused her Patronus to change its form to that of a wolf, although its large, shaggy intermediate form only reinforced Harry's "Sirius" theory.

Tonks escorts Harry Potter to the school gates, and casts her wolf Patronus
With the news that Lord Voldemort had returned being confirmed by the Ministry, Hogwarts received a team of Aurors to help protect the castle from any threats. Tonks was part of the task force and was stationed in Hogsmeade. On 1 September, she rescued Harry from being sent back to London in one of the carriages on the Hogwarts Express, where he had been incapacitated by Draco Malfoy, then covered with his Invisibility cloak, and escorted him to the school gates. She could do this because she had been watching the students exit the train and immediately went to investigate when Harry had not gotten off too.

Tonks often patrolled the corridors of Hogwarts at the request of Albus Dumbledore, when he knew he would be away from the school searching for information regarding Voldemort's Horcruxes. She also patrolled Hogsmeade and met Harry shortly after he had confronted Mundungus Fletcher, when the latter was trying to sell items from Grimmauld Place to Aberforth Dumbledore. She apparently had abandoned her guard post in Hogsmeade and "come bursting in to see Dumbledore, if that's really why she was here". This may have been linked to a werewolf attack on a five year old boy.

Battle of the Astronomy Tower
Tonks was patrolling the school with Remus and Bill Weasley on the night that the Death Eaters managed to invade the castle, via a Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement, and fought against them in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower in 1997. During the battle, she duelled Thorfinn Rowle, who fired spells rapidly at the young Auror in an attempt to subdue her, though he ultimately failed and was forced to retreat with his companions.

The funeral of Albus Dumbledore
In the aftermath of the battle, Tonks saw the love that Fleur Delacour held for Bill Weasley despite injuries suffered at the hands of the werewolf Fenrir Greyback. In the hospital wing, she publicly told Remus that she loved him, and that was all that mattered. Despite his protests that his and Bill's situations weren't the same, the two started a relationship, since Remus also held feelings for her. At the funeral of Albus Dumbledore, Tonks and Remus stood together, holding hands, and her hair had returned to her preferred bubble-gum pink colour.

Marriage
A pregnant Tonks with her new husband
Tonks and Remus married in a quiet ceremony in July, 1997, shortly before the Order operation to spirit Harry away from the Dursleys ahead of his seventeenth birthday. Both Remus and Tonks were unhappy that Harry was unable to attend their small wedding, as he couldn't be allowed to leave the protection of his relatives' home, since it was linked to the power of his mother's loving sacrifice when she willingly died for him. 

Pius Thicknesse, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, had made it an imprisonable offence to create a Portkey near Harry's home, and as he was underage he could be Traced if he Apparated, and hence could not leave to attend without endangering his life. This did not leave Harry nor the Order a lot of options.

Tonks had unexpectedly become pregnant sometime after the wedding and presumably tried to tell Harry before the Battle of the Seven Potters, but was interrupted by "Mad-Eye" Moody.

Battle of the Seven Potters
Tonks, Remus and Order of Phoenix members at 4 Privet Drive
The Order ultimately decided that they would break the charm around Harry several days before his birthday on 31 July, so that they would have the element of surprise; as Voldemort apparently expected them to wait until he was seventeen to attempt to whisk him away. Tonks, along with a dozen members of the Order and Harry's friends, travelled to 4 Privet Drive, where they were to escort Harry to safety. Tonks took the role of a protector, flying on a broom with Ron Weasley (disguised as Harry). It soon became clear that Voldemort had expected such a move, as at least thirty Death Eaters were waiting to engage them in battle. During the flight from Little Whinging, Tonks and Ron were chased by Bellatrix as they headed to Ron's Great-Aunt Muriel's home. Tonks and Bellatrix engaged in a mid-air duel, whilst Ron stunned one of her fellow Death Eaters straight to the head. Bellatrix seemed as determined to kill Tonks as she was to rid Voldemort of Harry, though Tonks ultimately escaped from her and gravely injured her husband, Rodolphus Lestrange.

Tonks and Remus safely at the Burrow shortly after the sky battle
They made it to Muriel's, but missed their Portkey to the Burrow. Muriel delayed them further by fussing over them, but they appeared to Apparate into the sky above the Burrow and perform a crash landing into the garden. Remus was grateful and relieved that she was alive, but "sounded almost angry at Tonks" when he demanded what kept her so long and what had happened to her. As she told what happened; "A muscle was jumping in Lupin's jaw. He nodded, but seemed unable to say anything else." Mr and Mrs Weasley ran outside when they got the news of Tonks and Ron's arrival, and thanked Lupin and Tonks repeatedly for bringing back their sons alive. The moment was sobered by Bill Weasley's revelation that her mentor, Mad-Eye Moody, had been murdered by Lord Voldemort. Tonks openly cried in front of her friends at the news that her beloved mentor had been murdered, as she was Mad-Eye's favourite and protégée at the Ministry of Magic.

Wedding of Bill and Fleur
Kingsley's Patronus interrupting Bill and Fleur's wedding day
In the days following, Tonks was over the moon and radiant, although she didn't reveal why. She briefly attended Harry's birthday party before leaving at the imminent arrival of Rufus Scrimgeour. Tonks later was a guest at Bill and Fleur's wedding the day after. She was talking to Charlie Weasley when the wedding was disrupted by Death Eaters, following the Fall of the Ministry and death of Scrimgeour. Tonks was seen with Remus preparing for the battle and casting a Shield Charm. It is unknown if she escaped or if she was questioned by the intruders, along with some of the other guests, before being released.

Childbirth
Shortly after the wedding, Tonks and Remus split up. Remus feared for the child Tonks was carrying, worried that the child would be a werewolf like him. All of his old fears over his relationship with Tonks resurfaced, and he withdrew from her rather than hurt her. Tonks moved back in with her parents. However, their split didn't last very long. Remus, after arguing with Harry at 12 Grimmauld Place, finally saw sense and reunited with Tonks sometime before Christmas.

Before Easter in 1998, Tonks learnt that her father had been murdered by Snatchers. She ultimately gave birth to a son, Teddy Remus Lupin, just after Easter and named him in honour of her late father. Tonks and Lupin both felt that Harry should become Teddy's godfather, and he accepted. To the relief of Remus, Teddy inherited Tonks's metamorphmagi abilities, which he demonstrated mere hours after his birth, and showed no signs of lycanthropy.

Battle of Hogwarts and death
Tonks and Remus during the beginning stage of the final battle
When Neville Longbottom had raised the call to arms for Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix to fight against the Death Eaters in the Battle of Hogwarts, Tonks initially didn't answer the call. She was staying with her mother Andromeda and her infant son Teddy. However, she couldn't stand not knowing what was happening while Remus was fighting.

Tonks Apparated to the Hog's Head and travelled through the makeshift tunnel in the bar and into the Room of Requirement. She then joined the battle and fired spells down at Death Eaters from a window of the castle, along with Ginny, before asking Aberforth Dumbledore if he had seen Remus. He replied that he was duelling Antonin Dolohov and had not been seen since, so she rushed off to find him. It is unknown if she ever did.

Remus and Tonks's dead bodies lying in the Great Hall during the one-hour armistice
During the battle, Nymphadora was finally killed by her own aunt, Bellatrix, in the third of their duels, probably and partially because she had just recovered from childbirth. Tonks' body was laid out, pale and peaceful looking, in the Great Hall next to her husband, who had died at the hands of Dolohov. Her death was avenged by Molly when she in turn killed Bellatrix.

Legacy
Tonks's, Remus's, Fred Weasley's and Colin Creevey's deaths caused Harry great pain before and after his ultimate defeat of Lord Voldemort. Teddy would be raised by Tonks's mother, Andromeda, though he would dine at Harry's and the Weasleys' homes three or four times a week. Her son seemed to have a close relationship with Bill Weasley's daughter, Victoire Weasley, making it possible that he could become an official member of the family Tonks herself had been so close to.

Calamity
During the 2010s, Tonks appeared as a Foundable during the Calamity. Volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force were able to free her, allowing Tonks to return to her original time.

Physical appearance
Tonks with white-blond hair
Tonks was a young witch with a pale heart-shaped face and dark twinkling eyes. As a Metamorphmagus, she could change her appearance at will. She typically kept her hair short and spiky, and often bubblegum-pink.  

She has also worn short and spiky violet hair, curly white-blonde hair, and waist length tomato-red hair. Her natural hair colour might have been mousy brown since it was stuck on that colour during the year she had difficulty morphing.

While joking around with Hermione and Ginny at Grimmauld Place, Tonks changed her nose into a pig nose resembling Dudley's, a "beak-like protuberance" resembling Snape's, and a nose like a button mushroom.

In 1995 she disguised herself as a tweedy tall woman with iron grey hair and an old lady in a purple hat shaped like a pork-pie.  

Ron Weasley believed that no man would choose Tonks over Fleur Delacour, stating that Tonks was "okay looking when she's not doing stupid things with her nose and hair" but not as pretty as Fleur.

Personality and traits
Tonks was enthusiastic, bubbly, and easily able to make friends with people she had just met. She was eager and would often want to help Molly Weasley in the preparation of dinner at Grimmauld Place, something that Molly was not eager about. As a Metamorphmagus, Tonks was known for using her gift for lighter purposes, such as experimenting with her appearance for entertainment. Despite this, she had difficulty controlling her magical abilities when she was unhappy, such as when her love was rejected by Remus Lupin or when she was very angry.

A notoriously clumsy Tonks tripping over an umbrella stand
Tonks was notoriously clumsy and curious. For example, she smashed a plate in the Dursley's kitchen during their rescue of Harry Potter and knocked over an umbrella stand in Grimmauld Place. In her youth, Tonks tried to solve her mistakes in unorthodox ways, though they were not always effective.

Despite her young age, Tonks possessed an incredible will. This is evident when she cast a non-verbal Patronus Charm, which requires a powerfully happy memory, despite being highly miserable at the time. Tonks was a staunchly loyal supporter of Albus Dumbledore. In her work for the Order of the Phoenix, she was brave, dependable, and selfless. She repeatedly put her life on the line for the sake of following through with Dumbledore's plans.

Tonks rather disliked her given name and considered her mother as a fool for naming her as such, thus insisting to be called "Tonks" instead. She didn't express any rejection when others referred to her as "Dora", a shortened form of the given name she detested so much. This may have been because her father and her husband both called her it.

Having been trained in the use of both defensive and offensive magic by Alastor Moody, Tonks was a highly accomplished and skilful witch. She was a proficient duellist and a Metamorphmagus. Her skills allowed her to hold her own against and even defeat several experienced Death Eaters.

Tonks conjuring a corporeal Patronus (form of a wolf)
Non-verbal magic: Tonks was capable of performing non-verbal magic, including advanced charms. For instance, she was able to duel several skilled Death Eaters without saying a single word, as well as conjure a corporeal Patronus non-verbally. This testifies to her being a skilful powerful witch, as non-verbal magic is very difficult.
Auror skills: Tonks was rather young for an Auror and the last person to become a fully fledged Auror before Harry Potter was accepted, which spoke for her considerable magical skills. However, her clumsiness gave her trouble with the Stealth and Tracking portion of the course, as she almost failed for this. Her work position required proficiency in the practical application of magic and exceptional marks at school, highlighting her abilities as a witch. Besides this, her father noted that she had been in several sticky situations in her time as an Auror and had always found a way to emerge from them unscathed.
Duelling: As an official Dark Wizard catcher, Tonks' duelling talents were naturally considerable and her reflexes were very fast despite her clumsiness, which sometimes got her into trouble at work. She fired a Stunning Spell at top Death Eater Lucius Malfoy, though it should be noted that he was caught off guard and it is unknown if it actually hit him. She was capable of duelling Thorfinn Rowle to a stalemate despite him rapidly firing spells at her, before Harry Potter hit him with a hex. Tonks survived her first two encounters with the most powerful lieutenant of Lord Voldemort, her aunt Bellatrix Lestrange. Despite being defeated by her aunt during the first encounter, she was able to duel her for a significant period of time. During her second encounter with her aunt, she was able to duel her aunt to a standstill in a mid-air battle between the two and injured Bellatrix's husband, Rodolphus Lestrange, at the same time, albeit with help from Ron Weasley. However, Tonks was ultimately murdered by Bellatrix during the Battle of Hogwarts, though she just had recovered from giving birth and it is unknown what the nature of this encounter was. In her youth, she was even able to hold her ground against an Unidentified Dark Witch and the Wizard in white robes alone, and even managed to disarm and bind the Wizard in white robes in ropes, while she was only a sixth year and her enemies were adults.
Tonks changing her appearance for Ginny Weasley's amusement
Metamorphmagus: Unlike most other wizards and witches, Tonks possessed the ability to change her physical appearance at will, without the need for a potion or a spell to assist. With simply a thought, she was capable of changing her facial features, nose shape, the colour of her hair and eyes, or even her entire form. Tonks used this ability both to entertain people and to stop people from recognising her, as evidenced by her ability to take the form of Professor Binns, a ghost. Tonks' rare skill was invaluable for espionage, as she worked as a covert operative inside the Ministry to feed the Order information and disguised herself as an old woman to escort Harry to the Hogwarts Express. She also passed the Disguise and Concealment portion of her Auror training without any studying.
Transfiguration: As an Auror, Tonks would have achieved a N.E.W.T. in this subject as well, since Aurors frequently have to transfigure and un-transfigure things in their line of work. She achieved either an "Exceeds Expectations" or "Outstanding" in this subject.
Charms: Tonks demonstrated considerable talent in charm-work. In 1995, she effectively cast a Scouring Charm to clean Hedwig's cage, another charm to pack Harry's belongings before leaving Privet Drive, and the Stunning Spell against Lucius Malfoy. She was also able to effectively cast the Shield Charm as a means of protection. Furthermore, Tonks could cast a corporeal Patronus, which is an incredibly advanced piece of magic, by the time she was in her fourth year in Hogwarts. Besides this, she was one of only a handful of people who knew how to use a Patronus as a means of communication.
Defence Against the Dark Arts: A natural performer in defensive magic, Tonks proved her skill in this field as an Auror and Order of the Phoenix member, including counter-curses as she could remove a Full Body-Bind Curse. She knew how to check if a door had an Imperturbable Charm on it, by flicking objects at the door in question, teaching this skill to Ginny Weasley. Seeing as how a N.E.W.T. in the subject is a mandatory requirement for Auror training, she likely achieved excellent results at both O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. level.
Flying: Tonks was a great broomstick flyer, as demonstrated by her escorting Harry from the Dursleys' house along with the Order. She was even able to emerge unscathed from a duel fought on a mid-air broomstick against her aunt, who was also proficient in flying a broomstick.
Apparition: Like most adult wizards and witches, Tonks was capable of Apparating successfully at will. In 1996, after visiting Molly Weasley, she left by Disapparating.
Healing magic: In 1996, Tonks effectively used the healing spell Episkey to fix Harry's nose when it was broken, showing she was skilled with medical magic.
Potions: Tonks had achieved a N.E.W.T. in the subject, considering how knowledge of poisons and antidotes are essential studies for Aurors. She must have earned an "Outstanding" in her O.W.L. exam, since she was taught by Severus Snape, and likely had earned either an 'Outstanding' or an 'Exceeds Expectations' on her N.E.W.T. exam.
Herbology: As an Auror, Tonks would have had to have achieved either an "Outstanding" or "Exceeds Expectations" in her O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. in this subject, considering how Aurors often have to handle dangerous magical plants in their work.
Divination: Tonks possessed considerable proficiency and knowledge in the field of Divination, as she earned either an "Exceeds Expectations" or "Outstanding" in the subject at O.W.L. level that allowed her to study it further at N.E.W.T. level.
Detective skills: As an Auror, Tonks was an effective detective, intelligent and able to make logical deductions. For example, she quickly found Harry immobilised on the Hogwarts Express based on subtle clues. Additionally, she was able to carefully fulfil her duties to the Order without jeopardising her career at the Ministry.
Muggle Studies: Tonks earned an O.W.L. in Muggle Studies at Hogwarts, and continued the subject on N.E.W.T. level, showing her proficiency and knowledge in this field..
Possessions
Tonks' wand
Wand: As was the case with most wizards and witches, Tonks' wand was among her most valued magical possessions. Her wand was of unknown length, wood, and core materials. This wand was manufactured by Garrick Ollivander sometime before 1984. She wielded this wand throughout her career as an Auror.
Comet 260: Tonks owned a Comet 260 broomstick with a rounded wood twig accent piece and strings and ribbons tied to the handle.
T-shirt of the Weird Sisters: Tonks owned a Weird Sisters T-shirt, implying she was a fan of the band.
Handkerchief: Tonks owned a small cloth handkerchief.
Relationships
Family
The House of Black
Tonks maintained a very good relationship with her parents, although she utterly detested the name Nymphadora, which was bestowed upon her by her mother. She took after her father, preferring a little disorder and mess to fanatical cleanliness which mother ironically excelled at, referring to the Dursleys' immaculate home as she rescued Harry from the house. She was affectionately called Dora by her father, which she didn't seem to mind even though it was technically a shortened version of her first name. Shortly before her death, Tonks learned that her own father died and decided to name her son after him.

Sirius Black, her first cousin once removed
Tonks's extended family was populated by members of the House of Black, although she wasn't considered a member of the House since her mother had married a Muggle-born and had been struck off the family tree, much like her first cousin once removed, Sirius Black. He mentioned that Tonks' mother was his favourite cousin while growing up. Since Sirius spent most of Tonks' life in Azkaban, the two never got a chance to really know each other. On occasion Tonks mentioned that she thought Sirius was still handsome even after the time he spent in Azkaban.

Despite the fact that they barely knew each other, it can be assumed that she was upset by his death, most likely because he was family and an ally to the Order of the Phoenix. Prior to Sirius' death, Tonks was duelling Bellatrix (Sirius' murderer) and was defeated by her. Hermione stated that she might feel guilty because of this, but it was only speculation.

Bellatrix Lestrange, her maternal aunt and murderer
Her aunts included Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy, which meant Draco Malfoy was among her many cousins. Both Bellatrix and Narcissa refused to acknowledge Nymphadora as their niece, as they had already severed all bonds with Andromeda when she married a Muggle-born, and even felt humiliated when Voldemort made fun of them about Tonks' marriage with a werewolf. Bellatrix seemed particularly eager to kill her niece whenever they encountered one another, especially after Voldemort instructed her to "prune" her family tree. The pair had several duels, and Tonks noted that Bellatrix seemed as keen to murder her as she was to rid the Dark Lord of Harry. She eventually succeeded during the Battle of Hogwarts on 2 May, 1998. 

It can be assumed that Narcissa didn't consider Teddy Lupin, Nymphadora's son, to be a member of the Black family either, as he had known Muggle ancestry and a werewolf for a father, thus making his blood impure. Since her mother was disowned after marrying her father, Tonks' name wasn't on the Black's family tree, so the family house-elf, Kreacher, who was supposed to listen to anyone in the family, refused to take orders from Tonks. Instead, he kept muttering insults about her half-blood status.

Remus Lupin
Remus Lupin, her husband and father of her son
At some point during her time with the Order of the Phoenix, Tonks met and fell in love with fellow member Remus Lupin, who found her amusing, then impressing, and eventually reciprocated her feelings, although he didn't notice them at first because he was used to considering himself unclean and unworthy. After a year of increasingly warm friendship, Tonks made an idle remark about one of their fellow Order members during a mission they had together ("He’s still handsome, isn't he, even after Azkaban?"). Before he could stop himself, Remus had replied bitterly that he supposed she had fallen for his old friend ("He always got the women."). At this, Tonks replied: "You’d know perfectly well who I’ve fallen for, if you weren’t too busy feeling sorry for yourself to notice." 

Both of them were similar in youth, as Tonks had a tendency to impersonate her teachers. 

Despite being extremely happy, Remus felt that any relationship between the two of them was too dangerous because he was a werewolf. He also felt he was too old for her — being thirteen years older than she was — and too poor due to his difficulties in maintaining a job because of his condition. She tried on several occasions to convince him otherwise, but he constantly refused her pleas and even volunteered for long-term, lethal missions to keep distance between them. Tonks became depressed over this and confided in Molly Weasley. Her emotional state caused her metamorphic abilities to suffer, and her hair became mousy brown rather than its usual pink (although it is possible that this is just due to her either wanting to look more like her husband or her misery at him not loving her appearing deliberately). Her Patronus also changed, resembling a wolf that showed her love for Remus. While on Hogsmeade duty, Tonks was informed that a werewolf had been killed by Fenir Greyback. She showed great concern by immediately contacting Dumbledore, to confirm whether or not it had been Lupin who was killed.

Lupin and Tonks
In 1997, following the death of Albus Dumbledore and the scarring of Bill Weasley, Tonks openly declared her love for Remus, citing that Fleur Delacour still loved Bill despite the nature of his injuries and the possibility of werewolf contamination. Remus protested that the situations were not the same, but eventually relented and the two began a relationship. They were married quickly in a quiet ceremony in the summer of 1997, shortly before the Battle of the Seven Potters. Tonks became pregnant by this time, so Remus, fearing that his child would be a werewolf, was initially horrified at the prospect, believing he had put both Tonks and his unborn child in great jeopardy. They split up just after Bill and Fleur's wedding, and Tonks went to stay with her parents. However, they reconciled sometime before Christmas, after Harry and Remus had argued over his responsibilities as a husband and father at Grimmauld Place.

After this on the radio station Potterwatch, Remus said that if he could talk to Harry then, he would have told him to follow his instincts because they are almost always right, it can be assumed that he was talking about returning to Tonks, with whom he passed almost all her pregnancy. The couple's son, Teddy Remus Lupin, was born just after Easter, 1998, named after Tonks' father who had been killed a few weeks earlier by Snatchers, and his father Remus. Sadly, the family would not have long together. During the Battle of Hogwarts, both Tonks and Remus were killed.

Teddy Lupin
Teddy Lupin, her son and only child
Tonks got pregnant in 1997 and was excited about her newborn son despite the fact that his birth would be around the time of a war. He was born in April and the couple choose to name him Teddy after Tonks' murdered father. It was obvious that Tonks loved her son very much. He was a Metamorphmagus, like his mother. Nymphadora wanted Harry Potter to be his godfather, as she and Remus decided that there was no one better than their young friend and wanted him to raise their son if they died.

Unfortunately Tonks was murdered by her aunt, Bellatrix Lestrange in the Battle of Hogwarts and never got to see her son grow up. Teddy was raised by his grandmother, Andromeda. He also spent much of his time with Harry, Ginny, and their children. Teddy visited the Potter home four nights and week for dinner and was over so much that Harry thought he might as well move in with them. It can be assumed that Harry acted as a parental figure towards Teddy, honouring Tonks and Remus.

Jacob's sibling
Jacob's sibling and Tonks met in their first year at Hogwarts, and shared Herbology class together. Over the course of the next couple of years, they grew close and became best friends, often going to Hogsmeade to visit Zonko's Joke Shop in particular, in order to plan their pranks together.

Alastor Moody
Alastor Moody, her mentor and friend
Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody was Tonks' mentor during her time training as an Auror, and later whilst they were both in the Order of the Phoenix. Despite Moody's surly attitude and behaviour, Tonks was always at ease with him, making funny comments at his opinions and lectures, such as the one he gave Harry Potter on elementary wand-safety the night the Advance Guard escorted him to Grimmauld Place. Other witches and wizards found him too intimidating and weren't brave enough to tease him openly, but because the pair were quite close, Tonks didn't mind laughing at him.

For his part, Moody was openly fond of Tonks. Harry once noted that she had been his favourite during their time together at the Ministry. When Tonks was injured during her duel with Bellatrix Lestrange in the Department of Mysteries, Mad-Eye crawled his way to her side in an effort to help her regain consciousness, despite having been injured himself by Antonin Dolohov. Tonks was devastated by Moody's death in 1997, openly crying in front of the Weasley family and rest of the Order of the Phoenix members.

Harry Potter
Harry Potter, a close friend
Nymphadora Tonks and Harry Potter met in 1995 when, as a member of the Advance Guard, she was a part of the Order's operation to transfer Harry from 4 Privet Drive to 12 Grimmauld Place. At the time of their first meeting, Harry was intimidated by the rest of the Advance Guard, but not Tonks who was clumsy and funny. The pair immediately took a liking to each other, and Harry was particularly impressed by Tonks's position as an Auror and extraordinary Metamorphmagus powers. Tonks was impressed with Harry's Firebolt and tried to comfort him during his trying times with the Ministry of Magic. Adopting a big sister role for him, Tonks would greet him by saying "Wotcher, Harry". Later, during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Tonks was among the Order members that came to the rescue of Harry and his friends. Harry was later relieved to hear that she would recover from the injuries she suffered at the hands of Bellatrix Lestrange.
