<html><p>Varrick was shocked to be told by Zhu Li that she would no longer be his assistant and would only stay with him if he treated her as an equal.
Later, while overseeing the manufacturing of the hummingbird mecha suits, inspiring his workers to increase their productivity since they only had two weeks to finish the project, Varrick was interrupted by Bolin, who wished to talk to him. He was shocked when Bolin revealed that he had brought back Zhu Li from his rescue mission at Zaofu. Zhu Li urged him to listen to her first before he said anything. After she apologized for all the things she had said to him in front of Kuvira and revealed that he meant the world to her, Varrick told her she did not need to be so hard on herself. Although he gently reached for her as if he was going to cup her cheek, he grabbed a hold of her shoulder at the last moment and exuberantly exclaimed that he accepted her apology, before ordering her to man the assembly line like a good assistant. Much to his shock, Zhu Li refused to be his assistant any longer and demanded to be treated like an equal. As she stormed out, a clueless Varrick turned to Bolin and shrugged, much to the latter's annoyance.

Disgruntled, Varrick admitted that Baatar Jr. was a better inventor than he had originally thought, inadvertently giving Korra the idea to kidnap him to discover the weaknesses of Kuvira's enormous mecha suit that carried the spirit energy cannon.
A week later, Varrick received the help of Asami, Bolin, Mako, Suyin, Wei, and Wing to get at least a few hummingbird suits to working condition, since Kuvira's arrival was a week ahead of schedule. After she arrived hours later and sunk the United Forces' battleships in a matter of seconds with the spirit energy cannon, Varrick exclaimed that such destruction was exactly the reason why he had refused to build the weapon. When Korra later joined them at the factory, alerting them all that Raiko had surrendered, leaving the fate of the city in their hands, he stated that Baatar Jr. was a better inventor than he had originally thought for having been able to manufacture such a large mecha suit, though noted that no one was allowed to tell Baatar Jr. that. The comment gave Korra the idea to kidnap Baatar Jr. with the help of a stealth team of airbenders. As she brought Kuvira's second-in-command to the factory as well, Varrick stood by while she and Suyin tried to convince him to reveal how they could defeat the enormous mecha suit carrying the spirit energy weapon. After Baatar Jr. contacted Kuvira and seemingly succeeded to convince her to cease her conquest of the United Republic, Varrick was forced to run for his life when Kuvira traced Baatar Jr.'s radio call toward the factory and blew it up with her spirit energy cannon.

Varrick helped Asami and Zhu Li to adapt the prototypes of the hummingbird mecha suits to working conditions.
Varrick managed to survive the explosion and emerged from the rubble with everyone else when Bolin lifted an enormous piece of concrete. When Korra and Lin announced that they refused to give up Republic City to Kuvira and would take on her spirit energy cannon, Varrick noted that the benders were on their own, since the blast had destroyed all of the hummingbird mecha suits at their factory. After Asami reasoned that they could adapt the remaining prototypes to get them airborne, he left with her and all the wounded toward her office at Future Industries Tower, while the benders faced Kuvira and her army in an attempt to stop them or at the very least, slow them down. Despite their best efforts, Varrick, Zhu Li, and Asami had trouble getting the hummingbird suits to work. Believing he had fixed the hydraulics, he told Asami and Zhu Li to test out one of the suits. When Asami soon discovered that she was unable to stabilize the machine, blaming him for failing to fix it, he dismissed her complaint and ordered her to twist harder, though the suit spun out of control and crashed. After Daw warned them all that a platoon of mecha suits was incoming, Varrick announced that he knew how to take them down and promptly ordered Asami to disconnect all the electrical devices, before running out of her office with Zhu Li.

Varrick grew panicked upon discovering that Kuvira's enormous mecha suit was unaffected by his electromagnetic pulse.
The duo made their way to the roof of the tall tower and, after equipping Zhu Li with a spool of metal cables, started to climb the lightning rod. Varrick reasoned that since he could stop the regular sized mecha suits with a normal electromagnetic pulse, an enormous pulse could stop an enormous suit. As he was adjusting the wiring to put his plan into motion, he revealed to Zhu Li that he had been thinking a lot about her, admitting that there were several things he should tell her since there was a chance that they would not survive the battle with Kuvira. He started to recall his early life and ostrich horse, though before he could reach the point of his story, Zhu Li notified him that Kuvira's troops were within range. As she flipped the switch to the electromagnetic pulse, Varrick excitedly saw that the regular mecha suits all shut down, though was shocked to find the enormous suit unaffected. Panicked, he called for Zhu Li to "do the thing", though she sadly answered that she feared there were "no more things to do".

Returning inside, Varrick was asked by Bolin why his electromagnetic pulse attack had left Kuvira's enormous suit unaffected, though before he could answer, Baatar Jr. explained that it was because the suit was powered by spirit vine energy. When Hiroshi joined their group and postulated the idea to add plasma saws to the hummingbird mecha suits so they were able to land on Kuvira's machine and cut through its armor like a metal mosquito, Varrick alerted them all to the dangers of being crushed, prompting Korra to declare that the benders would distract Kuvira to keep that from happening. As such, following Hiroshi's lead, he, Asami, and Zhu Li added an electrical element to the welding torches already on their suits and converted them into plasma saws.

Before heading out with the hummingbird mecha suit, Varrick proposed to Zhu Li and kissed her when she accepted.
When the suits were ready and Zhu Li was about to board, Varrick walked up to her and, after swallowing nervously, declared that he needed to "attach" something before they took off. As Zhu Li was puzzled about the meaning of his words, he promptly opened the small box he was holding, revealing the green ring it held inside, and dropped to his knee, asking her if she would "do the thing for the rest of [their] lives". When she accepted his proposal, he slipped the ring on her finger and kissed her, before taking her in his arms and excitedly announce that they would go attack Kuvira's high-tech machine with their "barely-functional" prototype suits. The two subsequently boarded the same mecha suit, with Zhu Li being the pilot and Varrick manning the welding torch.

Approaching Kuvira's machine, Varrick told Zhu Li to land on the spot in the middle of the enormous suit's back, guiding her by making a comparison to a specific spot on his own back that he could never reach. The moment they touched down, Varrick started welding, though before he could inflict any serious damage, they were forced to abort their attempt, lest they would be crushed. Hovering at a safe distance, Varrick noted that he wished he had the kind of flexibility the suit had as to be able to reach that spot. They tried to land again, though Kuvira kept lashing out at them, preventing them from attempting another attack. Eventually, Varrick and Zhu Li's suit had a wing blown off when Kuvira fired her spirit energy cannon. Before they crashed against a building, Zhu Li flipped the ejection seat switches and she and Varrick floated off to safety with their parachutes.

Having made a safe landing, Varrick and Zhu Li eventually made their way to the heart of the Spirit Wilds, where now a new spirit portal was located. Realizing Korra and Kuvira were nowhere to be found, Varrick and the rest of Team Avatar set out to search the area, scouring his surroundings from atop the wreckage of the enormous mecha suit. After all the spirits returned a moment later, he was glad to see that Korra emerged from the portal as well. After Kuvira was handcuffed and escorted away, Varrick joined in with the group hug the team bestowed on Korra.

Wedding
Varrick and Zhu Li were wed by Bolin on Air Temple Island.
Following Kuvira's defeat, Varrick and Zhu Li received permission from Tenzin to hold their wedding ceremony and party at Air Temple Island, decorating parts of the island in a winter theme. While Bolin acted as the official during their ceremony, Varrick snapped at one of his cameramen to focus on him because it was his big day, as opposed to randomly filming the audience, and gave Bolin a skeptical look when the earthbender described his bond with Zhu Li as the "longest of long shots". His demeanor swiftly changed, however, when Bolin asked him if he, "Sir Iknik Blackstone Varrick of the Southern Water Tribe, master of the high seas", would take the Lady Zhu Li Moon as his lawfully wedded wife and treat her as his honored and cherished partner, to which he excitedly answered positively. In his own vows, Varrick had described a list of tasks that Zhu Li would have to perform, scrubbing his calluses on a bi-weekly basis being one of them, which Bolin refused to read. When Zhu Li accepted nonetheless and Bolin announced that they could "do the thing", Varrick was dipped by his wife so she could kiss him. As the couple turned to the now applauding audience, Varrick started to cry out of happiness. Wiping his tears, he took a remote out of his pocket and, together with Zhu Li, he flipped the switch, setting off a firework display.

During the dinner party, Varrick led his wife in a dance, though afterward he went to search for Tenzin, intending to borrow one of the airbender wingsuits to fly off the temple's tower.

Evacuee crisis
In the aftermath of Kuvira's invasion of the United Republic of Nations, Varrick joined his wife and other volunteers at the temporary evacuee camp. One evening, he was helping Zhu Li, Kya, and Tenzin distribute the last of the food rations to the hungry evacuees. When they ran out of supplies and the gathered crowd started to protest, Varrick asked in a panic what they should do now, as the evacuees had already devoured his entire supply of Varri-cakes. Despite the shortage, he produced one last cake he had saved for himself and immediately devoured the pastry, defending himself against the disapproving looks from Zhu Li, Tenzin, and Kya that he could not work on an empty stomach.

Varrick supported his wife's bid for president of the United Republic of Nations and assuaged her fears about losing to Raiko.
When Zhu Li was stressing about the situation and the fact that President Raiko was actively working against her, Varrick led her away from the crowd and inside a nearby tent, noting that he could not stand to see her so bent out of shape, and suggested that she massage her troubles away. Inside, he positioned himself on a chair and told Zhu Li to not hold back with the pressure, as he was especially tight in the shoulders. When she glared at him, noting that she had been under the impression that she was the one to be massaged, a nervous Varrick immediately switched places with her, vowing to be the best "shoulder-kneader" ever for her. During the massage, Zhu Li asked Varrick for his opinion on the possibility that she would run for president against Raiko. He was immediately enthusiastic about the idea, ensuring her that she would win as she was the most "tenacious, brilliant, inspiring woman" he knew and that the people loved her. When Zhu Li, comforted by his words, agreed with him and announced that she would run for president, an enthusiastic Varrick swept her off her feet, declaring that her decision called for a celebration.

Varrick donned his director's uniform as he led his camera crew to the fortified area around the spirit portal. He reminded the rest of his camera crew that there were no second takes in a "docu-mover", and made sure to frame the shot so the spirit portal was behind Zhu Li, taking care to amplify her publicity. As Zhu Li and Varrick continued filming and supporting the protests, Tokuga flew overhead in an airship, demanding that the United Republic withdraw his troops, or face poison gas attached to his airship, and if any attempts to attack the ship were made he had Asami Sato and Wonyong Keum on board, and they would be killed.

Zhu Li declared that they needed to start evacuating the people, and began leading the protesters and her filming crew away from the portal. Varrick advised the camera crew to make sure Zhu Li looked heroic as they filmed her. When it seemed like Zhu Li had everyone, she noticed a young girl named Sachi had been left behind due to an injured leg and ran back into the poison gas to attempt to save her. Zhu Li grabbed her and carried her into the safety of her mom. A member of the film crew confirmed he had captured the moment on camera, and a different film crew member captured footage of Raiko running away from the civilians in danger. Varrick excitedly proclaimed that they had a good docu-mover.

In the following three weeks, Varrick published his docu-mover, and many voters praised Zhu Li's altruism and condemned Raiko's decision to retreat during the crisis at the spirit portal. On election night, Varrick awaited the results of the election in a plaza with Zhu Li and her supporters, where his docu-movers played and Shiro Shinobi discussed the events of the election as he prepared to announce the results. As the results came in, Shiro announced that Zhu Li had won in a landslide victory of sixty-eight percent. Upon hearing the results, Zhu Li stood backstage as crowd members chanted her name, and Varrick congratulated her, before sending her on stage to "do the thing".

Serving as First Gentleman
After Zhu Li took office as president, Varrick approached Bolin, now Zhu Li's personal assistant, and asked about the earliest date he could have a dinner date with his wife. Bolin told him that there were no availabilities until the end of the month, and Varrick grew frustrated, asking who knew being president would be so much work. Bolin responded that he was sure that Zhu Li knew.

Varrick was present when Wu gave his speech announcing the impending democratic elections to take place in the State of Gaoling, and nervously plugged his ears as Wu awkwardly answered the press's questions through the medium of song. He later attended the beginning of Kuvira's trial.

After Kuvira's return from Gaoling, Varrick was summoned to be a witness to her tribunal. The judges asked him to confirm that he initially helped develop spirit technology for the Earth Empire, which he accepted, but added that he tried to shut the project down once he realized how dangerous it was. He was asked if Kuvira agreed with his decision, and he told the court that she did not, forcing him to keep working on it and threatening to kill him if he did not do as she said, adding that she was a horrible person. Kuvira told him that his testimony was enough, and he cowered, pleading with her not to hurt him.

The judges ordered Kuvira not to intimidate the witness, and that they would proceed to hear the testimony, though Kuvira told them it would not be necessary, as she had decided to confess to her charges and enter a guilty plea.

Personality
Varrick's easygoing nature allowed him to relax even when he was on the brink of war.
As one of the wealthiest people in the world, Varrick is used to having his every need catered to. Since no one is willing to disagree with him, he sometimes comes to believe his own stories, such as when he thought he was levitating, a belief with which everyone went along. He is also a good judge of character, prepares for any issue well, and can quickly come up with a plan to avoid danger. However, at times he can also be impulsive, not thinking through all the consequences of his actions, like when he started a rebellion against Unalaq. This does not mean, however, that he is always incorrect about there being a need for action. Varrick loves being able to do what he pleases on his own terms, and as such, does not like to date clingy women, even going as far as building a yacht to escape from them.

Varrick has been shown to be rude at times, such as barging in right after Unalaq's speech or rudely interrupting a serious conversation between Korra and Suyin with one of his experiments.

While appearing happy-go-lucky, Varrick hides a sly side as a slick and underhanded businessman.
Varrick's eccentricities also masks his more dubious nature, as a sly and slick businessman who uses underhanded means to get what he wants, even if it means breaking the law. As such, he is not above being unfettered and charismatic, and is able to orchestrate large scale operations to buy out other companies just to increase his own wealth.

Despite this, Varrick does have redeeming features and a conscience, which he mistakes as being "voices in his head". He considers hurting others to be beneath him and felt guilty upon realizing that his actions had brought harm to some of his allies. As a result, he helped Team Avatar, readily aiding them despite there being no monetary benefit, and was adamant about terminating his spirit vine project, wary about the destructive power it held if weaponized.

Varrick was very dependent on Zhu Li, requiring her assistance for many different tasks, such as preparing his tea, scratching an irritable rash or to cater to him within prison. He frequently uses the phrase, "Do the thing!" to prompt someone to take whatever action is necessary at any given time. In addition, he mostly relies on his men and associates to do his dirty work, as he rarely participates in any of his planned schemes in order to keep a low profile.

Following his marriage to Zhu Li, Varrick displayed a notably more mature personality, taking his wife's decision to run for President of the United Republic quite seriously, and putting aside his own needs to support her. He even put an entire film crew on the task of making Zhu Li look more impressive by capturing his wife's heroic actions during the Tokuga crisis, while simultaneously capturing Raiko's less flattering moments of self-preservation.

Abilities
Varrick is an innovative thinker and aggressive businessman, having been able to expand his company from one canoe to a global network. As an entrepreneur, Varrick is also keen on identifying and capitalizing on the needs of those around him. Similarly, he is able to convince others to work for his betterment, essentially having convinced the rebels to incite war against the North in order to benefit his business. Partly due to his company's technological advances, Varrick is capable of piloting ships and commandeering a yacht. Varrick is also physically fit, usually ending his brainstorming sessions by performing an elaborate flip off a bar he uses to hang himself upside down.

Varrick is well-disciplined and knowledgeable in various fields of science, having spearheaded several technological advancements. His breakthroughs include applications of magnetism, such as a high-speed maglev train, and the stabilization of spirit energy, though he later discovered that it was too dangerous for anyone to handle. He is also good at thinking on his feet, being able to create a makeshift electromagnetic pulse device with the aid of a metal table leg and an electric generator.

Varrick has shown himself to be charismatic, which enables him to talk his way out of many situations as well as entertain people by telling stories. He is also a master of deception, using the Avatar to help instigate a civil war, rob Asami blind of her assets, and drive a wedge between Mako and Bolin, all the while maintaining sympathy for the South and making a profit from the war. He is also a master strategist, being able to plan false flag operations that his men or associates would execute at key moments. It was only by process of elimination that Mako realized Varrick's culpability in the acts of terrorism on Republic City while the masses simply assumed the Northern Tribe was guilty.
