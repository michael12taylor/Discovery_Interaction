A firebending prodigy, Azula was sadistic, manipulative, and obsessed with power. She was a skilled strategist who orchestrated the coup of the Earth Kingdom capital, Ba Sing Se, and halted the invasion on the Day of Black Sun.

Azula harbored deep mental instabilities, believing her mother loved Zuko more than her. Raised by her father in an environment without a mother-figure, Azula had to be nothing less than perfect in her father's eyes in order to gain affection and attention from him. After the betrayal of her two closest friends Mai and Ty Lee, these instabilities were brought up to the surface. Upon the arrival of Sozin's Comet, Azula was soon to be crowned Fire Lord; however, her defeat at the hands of her brother Zuko and Katara caused her to suffer a complete mental breakdown.

Following her emotional breakdown, Azula was put in a mental health facility to recover, though she eventually joined Team Avatar on their search for Ursa, as part of her secret agenda to betray them and usurp the throne from Zuko. At this quest's completion, however, Azula escaped the team's supervision.

Sometime after her exile, Azula returned to the Fire Nation Capital in secret. Having finally accepted that she would never be Fire Lord, Azula resorted to manipulating Zuko so that she could rule through him. Gathering a group of female supporters, she took on the guise of the mythical Kemurikage to intimidate Ukano into threatening Zuko. When that failed, Azula and her followers resorted to kidnapping children in the capital, setting the city into civil unrest. Though Zuko and his allies were able to rescue the children, Azula and her followers escaped.

History
Early life
Early childhood
Princess Azula was born to Prince Ozai and Princess Ursa in 85 AG and was named after her paternal grandfather, Fire Lord Azulon. Azula grew up with all the riches, splendor, and privileges of royalty in the Fire Nation. Her sharp wits and the fact that she was a firebending prodigy gained her great attention and acclaim, which quickly made her Ozai's favorite child. Her father began raising her as his true heir from an early stage, taking her into his confidence and educating her in politics. Azula later attended the Royal Fire Academy for Girls, where she met and befriended Mai and Ty Lee, two daughters of Fire Nation noblemen. One of the reasons the princess chose them as friends was because the two girls possessed skills that she did not, and so she spent part of her adolescence learning these abilities from them.

Despite the heightened tensions in their family due to their father's favoritism of Azula, cohesion and peace were still strong among the young family during Azula and Zuko's childhood; for example, the two would often reenact the final duel of Love amongst the Dragons after watching the play during their frequent vacations at Ember Island. Both siblings happily recalled these memories many years later. However, as they grew older, the siblings eventually grew apart.

Deteriorating relationship with Zuko and Ursa
Though Azula was clearly favored by Ozai, she felt that her mother loved Zuko much more than her, creating a rift of jealousy between her and Ursa and Zuko. Confronted daily with this mother/son bonding, Azula often attempted to gain Ursa's attention in some way. However, these attempts usually resulted in family quarrels. Around 94 AG, Azula walked together with her mother and brother in the royal garden. Feeling neglected and bored, as Ursa only talked with Zuko, Azula ignited a flower, prompting Zuko to tell on her to Ursa. Ursa scolded Azula for disrespecting the royal garden, but the princess just said that the flower "deserved it", as it had not grown to her liking. In retaliation for telling on her, Azula burned Zuko's bottom, calling him a tattletale. However, Ursa promptly sent her to her room. Scowling over this treatment, Azula stormed off. Scenes like this became regular occurrences, and as a result, Azula developed an increasingly hostile attitude toward Zuko and Ursa.

Azula smiled triumphantly at her shocked brother while he was reprimanded by Ozai.
Months later, Azula and her family ate together at the palace dining hall. The princess, dissatisfied with the conservative training techniques of her firebending teacher, happily told her father that she set his britches on fire after being lectured by him. Ozai agreed that the teacher sounded like a fool for insisting on specified forms and declared that he would send him to the colonies as punishment. Full of spiteful joy, Azula said that it "serve[d] him right" and called him a "dummy". When Zuko attempted to defend the tutor, he was promptly silenced by his father, who reprimanded him for his poor firebending skills and compared him with Azula and her natural talent for the bending art. Ozai revealed that he nearly discarded Zuko at birth, believing the prince to be a nonbender, causing Azula to smile triumphantly at her shocked brother.

Even as a young child, Azula exhibited a duplicitous and cunning streak, as demonstrated when she manipulated her mother to get her way.
Azula often displayed her natural talents, along with her tendency for malice and perfection, but these traits were especially clear when the princess played with her friends in the royal garden in 95 AG. When Ty Lee successfully performed a cartwheel after Azula's failed attempt, she shoved her friend to the ground out of jealousy while laughing gleefully. When she saw ten-year-old Mai attempting to hide her crush on her brother Zuko, Azula used her acting and cunning to convince her mother to make Zuko play with them. During their game, she placed an apple on Mai's head and set it on fire, forcing Zuko to tackle Mai into a fountain to put out the fire. She found great pleasure in embarrassing the two of them.

Ursa's banishment
A true tactician, Azula desired power from a young age, suggesting that her father would make a better Fire Lord than the heir apparent, her uncle Iroh. She torched a doll that her uncle had sent her as a gift from the Earth Kingdom, preferring the weapon Zuko had gotten over a simple doll. Not long after this, her cousin Lu Ten was killed in battle, prompting Iroh to abandon his legendary six-hundred-day siege of Ba Sing Se, which in turn prompted Azula to call him "a quitter and a loser". She even showed some slight disrespect to her grandfather, as when she was told to call him "Fire Lord Azulon", she responded with, "Can't we just call him grandfather? He's not exactly the powerful firebender he used to be".

Azula told Zuko that their father was going to kill him on Azulon's orders.
Shortly after receiving this news, Azula and the rest of her family went before Fire Lord Azulon, and she put on a spectacular display of her firebending prowess. After her routine, she watched smugly as Zuko tried to copy her performance but failed. When Azulon ordered everyone except Ozai out of the room, Azula grabbed her brother and hid behind the curtains. From there, she and Zuko watched their father request that he be made Fire Lord instead of Iroh. When Zuko fled in fear of the Fire Lord's anger, Azula stayed behind to watch with amusement. She later met her brother back in his room, claiming gleefully that she heard her grandfather sentence him to death. She taunted him about it until their mother angrily pulled her away for a private talk. Under pressure from Ursa, Azula confessed what she overheard and was told by her mother to go to her room, which she did with a devious smile. A short time later, Azula played with the knife that Zuko had received from Iroh and coolly announced to him that no one knew where their mother was and their grandfather had passed away during the night. Soon after that, she watched her father's coronation with glee. No amicable feelings developed between her and Zuko throughout the next few years, as Ozai apparently began to favor her more and more over her brother during this period.

Rise to Crown Princess
Azula sadistically relished in the sight of her father burning her brother's face during their Agni Kai.
Azula, alongside Iroh and Zhao, watched Zuko's Agni Kai with his father. When Ozai burned her brother's face, she smiled smugly in triumph, along with Zhao. When Zuko was banished from the Fire Nation, Azula officially became Ozai's heir. For the next three years, she would continue her relentless training in firebending, strategy, and combat until she refined herself enough to serve her father. By this time, her firebending advanced to the level where her fire was blue, and she could create lightning, thus increasing her overall bending power and intensity, making her a formidable opponent.

Winter 99 AG
Shortly after Zhao's failed siege on the Northern Water Tribe, Azula was summoned by her father to his throne room. As she knelt before Fire Lord Ozai, he commented that Zuko was a failure and Iroh was a traitor. He charged her with a mission: to find and capture her uncle and brother.

Spring 100 AG
Ty Lee, Azula, and Mai disguised themselves as the Kyoshi Warriors, successfully infiltrated the Earth King's circle of trust, gained control of the Dai Li, and enacted the Coup of Ba Sing Se, thus almost granting the Fire Nation complete victory in the war.
Azula was supplied with a Fire Nation royal sloop, which included a crew and sailed to Zuko and Iroh's last known location. As they approached the port, Azula addressed her crew, emphasizing that she would not tolerate any reluctance to carry out their mission, even if they were apprehending members of the royal family. Before dismissing her crew, Azula reveled in their sense of fear. The ship's captain approached her, explaining that the tides would not allow them to bring the ship in before nightfall. Annoyed by the news, Azula deftly let the man know that his life was at stake if he did not follow her orders.

Azula found Zuko and Iroh in a village resort and invited them to the ship with the false promise of being accepted home with open arms. Her initial plan of luring back her two dissident family members was thwarted by her own ship's captain, who accidentally addressed Zuko and Iroh as prisoners. In the ensuing skirmish, Azula was thrown overboard, allowing her brother and uncle to escape. In order to pursue the Avatar, Azula formed an elite team consisting of her childhood friends Ty Lee, recruited from a circus, and Mai, who was living in Omashu as the governor's daughter. Azula did not manage to capture Aang and his friends in Omashu, but nonetheless was able to crush the city's resistance and secure it for the Fire Nation, renaming the city New Ozai in her father's honor. Azula continued to pursue the Avatar, Zuko, and Iroh for several weeks, making use of technological advancements such as the tank train, being able to find them and wound Iroh in Tu Zin before fleeing the scene.

After her initial failure to breach the strong outer wall of Ba Sing Se with the Fire Nation drill, Azula and her team encountered the Kyoshi Warriors led by Suki, who they swiftly defeated and took into custody. Hoping that it would break her, Azula sent Suki to the Boiling Rock high-security prison. Disguising themselves, Azula, Ty Lee, and Mai entered Ba Sing Se and successfully plotted a conspiracy with the treacherous minister Long Feng. She had the Dai Li arrest the Council of Five, the Earth King's highest-ranking generals, while she personally overthrew the sovereign. Sokka and Toph were arrested while attempting to warn Earth King Kuei against the plot, and Azula sent to a separate dungeon. Immediately afterward, Long Feng arrived on the scene and commanded the Dai Li to arrest Azula, attempting to double-cross her. Having prepared against a potential counter, Azula instead convinced the Dai Li to pledge loyalty to her. Realizing that he had been outplayed at his own game, the Grand Secretariat grudgingly surrendered. After taking control of the palace, Azula encountered Zuko in the Upper Ring and managed to convince him to join her in order to redeem his birthright as crown prince. During a battle with the Avatar in the Crystal Catacombs beneath the city, Azula mortally wounded Aang with a lightning strike just after he entered the Avatar State, leaving the Avatar presumed dead forever and the Earth Kingdom capital delivered into the hands of the Fire Nation.

Summer 100 AG
Azula firing lightning at Katara to gain an advantage during her Comet-Enhanced Agni Kai against Zuko.
After the fall of Ba Sing Se, Azula made arrangements for her friends, Zuko, and herself to return to the Fire Nation. Before leaving the Earth Kingdom capital, she passed her rulership over the city to one Joo Dee, whom she raised to the city's Supreme Bureaucratic Administrator. She also brought back her uncle Iroh in chains, who would be imprisoned in the Capital City Prison complex for his treachery. Back home, both she and her brother were welcomed as war heroes and were greeted by crowds of their people. However, Azula doubted that the Avatar was truly dead and believed that Zuko was hiding something from her. As such, she informed her father that Zuko had killed the Avatar, which would set him up for greater dishonor should he be proven to be alive.

Azula traveled with her friends and Zuko to Ember Island for a brief vacation while the Fire Lord conferred with his advisers in private. Azula took advantage of this opportunity to experience life as a normal person for the very first time, choosing to keep conceal her identity as a princess. The vacation was one of the few moments of her life when Azula opened up and revealed her pain and resentment about her relationship with her mother. After returning to the capital, Azula attended an important all-day war meeting with her father, her brother, and the nation's most important generals, where she suggested using Sozin's Comet to destroy the Earth Kingdom once and for all, a plan which dismayed Zuko and would contribute to his eventual defection from their nation.

Having gained knowledge of the invasion during her infiltration in the Earth Kingdom, Azula warned the Fire Lord in advance, and the royal family evacuated to an underground bunker prior to the invasion. Azula and her agents stalled Aang, Sokka, and Toph from finding Fire Lord Ozai before the eclipse ended. This distraction allowed the Fire Army to retaliate with full force once their bending was reactivated, bringing the invasion to an end.

Later, Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee visited the the Boiling Rock, where Zuko had been captured while infiltrating the high-security prison in an attempt to rescue Hakoda. Although it seemed as if Zuko, Sokka, Suki, and Hakoda would fall into the boiling lake during an escape attempt, Mai helped aid their escape. Enraged, Azula confronted her former friend, who confessed that her love for Zuko was greater than her fear for Azula. At that moment, Azula prepared to attack Mai, but Ty Lee stopped her by blocking her chi. Azula subsequently had both Mai and Ty Lee imprisoned as traitors. Afterward, Azula led a platoon of Fire Nation airships to the Western Air Temple, where she battled Zuko. During their skirmish, Azula nearly fell to her death after slipping from the airship, but was able to stop her descent by using her hairpin as an anchor in the cliff wall. Despite having failed to eliminate both Zuko and Aang, she smiled as the Avatar and his friends escaped the temple.

When Ozai departed to harness the power of Sozin's Comet to burn the Earth Kingdom, he named Azula as the new Fire Lord. Although Azula was astonished to receive the title, her father told her that while she would rule the homeland, he would become Phoenix King and become the supreme ruler of the world. As she prepared for her coronation, Azula began to crack under the pressures of her friends' betrayal and acceding to the throne, and her mental health began to deteriorate. She became suspicious of her servants and began to banish them from the nation, along with her personal advisors Lo and Li, her own Dai Li agents, and the Royal Procession. While attempting to cut her hair for the coronation, Azula saw a hallucination of her mother. Just before the High Sage was to crown Azula as Fire Lord, Zuko and Katara arrived at the palace. Azula challenged Zuko to a Comet-Enhanced Agni Kai, to which he agreed, noticing her imbalanced mental state. During their fight, Azula's attacks were wild, emotional, and reckless, albeit still powerful, while Zuko's attacks were calm and controlled, and eventually, he gained the upper hand. When he began to overpower her, Azula, responding to his challenge to use lightning, directed her attack toward Katara. However, Zuko intercepted her attack and was grievously injured as a result. Azula then attempted to defeat Katara, but the waterbender trapped them both in ice and chained her to the floor by taking advantage of her mental decay. Seeing herself defeated and usurped as Fire Lord, Azula let out a fiery roar before breaking down, sobbing and screaming.

After the Hundred Year War
Searching for Ursa
Azula agreed to help Zuko extract information from Ozai.
After her Agni Kai with Zuko and subsequent mental breakdown, Azula's insanity earned her Zuko's pity, and rather than being sent to prison, like their father Ozai was, she was committed to an asylum on a nearby island, where she was continuously monitored. Although she considered the mental health facility a "horrible" experience, Azula actually befriended some other patients. About a year later, she was visited by her brother, who told her that he had consulted with Ozai on several occasions in an attempt to learn Ursa's whereabouts, to no avail. Answering his request for help, Azula said that she needed nothing in return for her assistance, as the mere knowledge of being of service to the Fire Lord would be enough satisfaction. She also stated that she had been wondering as well what exactly happened to their mother following her disappearance six years earlier.

She was placed in an adjoining cell with her father, though they did not speak with each other for half an hour. Zuko observed this and brought them tea in an attempt to make the situation more enjoyable. Azula grabbed hold of the tray with her teeth, however, causing Zuko to fall over. She angrily accused him of wanting to see her lap up the beverage like an animal since she would have had no other way to drink it while confined in her straitjacket. Her outburst prompted Ty Lee to chi block her, rendering her completely immobile. Due to her poor mental health, Azula questioned the girl as to how "she", referring to Ursa, had managed to break the grasp of fear Azula used to have on her. Before the situation could escalate any further, Zuko intervened and stated that he had meant no harm and just wanted to ease the conversation with Ozai along. After being placed on her chair again, the chi blocked Azula arrogantly stated that if her brother wanted her and their father to have a dignified conversation, he should leave them alone, which he did.

Azula burned Ursa's letters, much to Zuko's shock and horror.
When Zuko was taking her back to her old quarters in the palace where she would be staying, he asked her whether or not she had been able to coax the needed information about Ursa's whereabouts from Ozai. She dodged the question and asked in return whether or not he had ever experienced the sensation of being chi blocked. When Zuko said he had not, she proceeded to meticulously describe the feeling, mentioning that one becomes extremely flexible right before regaining their full control. To prove her words, she twisted her arm out of her straitjacket and fired a lightning bolt at her brother. In the ensuing skirmish, she managed to free herself entirely and made her way into a nearby building. Via a hidden passageway, she went to one of Ozai's secret chambers, where she retrieved a stack of undelivered letters, which Ursa had written to her hometown. Before Zuko could take them from her, she burned them, having already read them herself. She concealed one of them, however, as it contained information that suggested Zuko was not actually Ozai's son and thus had no claims to the throne. Unaware that Ursa wrote down false information because she knew the letter would be intercepted by Ozai, Azula kept it for leverage so she could eventually overthrow Zuko and let her brother believe that all had been destroyed. In return for knowledge about what had been written in the allegedly burned letter, she requested to be allowed to go with him on his search for their mother.

Complying with the request, Zuko released her from the mental institution and allowed her to accompany him, unbound and with dignity. When she showed herself to Team Avatar, however, she was immediately attacked by Katara. She easily dodged their attacks and proceeded to taunt and insult Sokka. It did not come to a scuffle until the next day when a short struggle ensued between her and Sokka. Azula disarmed him with a small, non-lethal lightning shock after he threatened her with his boomerang. The rest of the team immediately intervened and immobilized her with their bending. Upon her release, she haughtily stated that if they all just stayed away from her, they would get along perfectly.

Azula was unable to cope with the fact that her mother loved her.
She traveled with Team Avatar on Appa to Hira'a to find her mother, but her mood was erratic, unpredictable, and characterized by delusions and hallucinations, as she constantly asked Team Avatar how "she" had contacted them, referring to her mother. Upon nearing Hira'a, she attempted to escape by jumping off of Appa. Aang swooped down and caught her in free fall, but she set his glider afire, causing him to crash to the ground and securing her getaway. She ran away but stopped as she neared a stream and heard her mother's voice coming from the water. She argued with the reflection, accusing Ursa of desiring to ruin her from the day she was born and heading a conspiracy to strip her of her power, of which she also claimed her mother had been jealous. However, she triumphantly stated that thanks to Ursa's letter, she now had all the proof she needed to take the throne from Zuko. She thus revealed her own plans to find and kill Ursa herself in order to stop her once and for all. She let out an emotionally toiled scream as the hallucination of her mother confirmed her love for her, prompting Azula to fire a lightning bolt at the mirage, stating the love declaration to be nothing more than Ursa's last treasonous attempt to set her own mind against her.

Azula saved Team Avatar from a moth wasp attack.
At that point, Zuko arrived and asked to whom she had been speaking. Reacting aggressively, Azula wanted to strike her brother down but was encased in ice by Katara before she got the chance. As the waterbender approached her, she accused her of being one of Ursa's co-conspirators. Her rant, however, was interrupted when the wolf spirit appeared and attacked the group. As they were being overpowered by moth wasps coughed up by the spirit, Azula asked Zuko to free her so she could help, convincing him that she could not possibly make things worse for them and stating that if he could not even trust his own family, there was no one left to be trusted. He melted her icy restraints, and true to her word, she created a large lightning bolt and shot it away from the group, drawing the light-oriented moth wasps and wolf spirit with it. That night, Azula was talking in her sleep and shivering from the cold before Zuko covered her with a blanket: during this time, he found the letter she was hiding and was left stunned by its contents.

The next day, the princess was awoken by another hallucination of Ursa. She was urged by her mother to stop what she was doing, as Ursa believed it was not Azula's destiny to assume the throne. In response, Azula intended to shoot her mother with lightning, but Ursa only pleaded with her more urgently to find her true destiny. Azula snapped out of her hallucination with Katara's hand in her grip; Sokka prepared his boomerang to strike her, but Katara managed to calm the unstable firebender down. After her outburst, Azula discovered that the letter she had kept was missing and immediately assumed that Zuko had taken it. Her brother was not at camp, however, and Azula threatened Sokka and Katara with fire to force them to tell her where Zuko had gone. After burning down a few nearby trees and bushes, she stormed off after Zuko.

Azula demanded Ursa's letter back from Zuko, believing it to be her key to the Fire Nation throne.
Azula found her brother sitting with Aang at the edge of a cliff discussing the letter questioning his heritage. Frustrated, she shot fire blasts at him, and a duel broke out. While Aang ran back to check up on Sokka and Katara, Azula was grabbed by Zuko and held over the cliff while she accused their mother of tipping him off to the letter's location before learning that he had held it all night. Zuko requested that they stop their fighting, to which Azula agreed, and they both returned to camp. After the rest of the team put out the fires, the entire group continued their journey to Hira'a.

They reached the border of Hira'a, and the Team Avatar disguised themselves using crimson robes. Azula was the only one who still wore her own outfit. The group arrived just as a performance of Love amongst the Dragons was ending. Azula and Zuko recalled the times they used to see the play and how they acted out the battle scene; Azula bragged she made a better Dragon Emperor, which is why she took up the role between the two. The play ended, and Azula followed the others. They met the leader of the Hira'a acting troupe, Noren, who offered them information on Ursa in addition to tea and an invitation to his and his wife, Noriko's, home. Azula and Zuko spoke with the couple's daughter, Kiyi, about her doll. The princess mentioned she used to give her dolls "headcuts" instead of haircuts, offering one for Kiyi's doll, which scared the young girl and caused Zuko to berate his sister. Afterward, the firebender remarked that she was "tempted to burn the whole place down, but resisted for [Zuko]". The thought drew Katara's ire, causing the two girls to argue. The increasing tensions between Katara and Azula resulted in Zuko declaring that Forgetful Valley would be the last stop for the trip.

Azula saved Sokka from Misu's plantbending attack.
Upon arrival, Azula attempted to make a path by burning parts of the valley, drawing criticism from the rest of the group once more. When Aang found a flutter bat that brought him to a pond, Azula and the others followed the two there. The Avatar said it was a spiritual place and urged everyone to respect it, but Azula once again saw a hallucination of Ursa urging her to stop the mission. The princess promptly went against Aang's word and blasted the pond with lightning, and yelled at Aang that Ursa had told him to bring them there. Katara was about to freeze her in place, but a rain of flower-shaped ice discs began to attack the team, and the nearby plants began to pull the team in one by one. Azula saved Sokka from a vine, explaining that the more "peasants" she kept around, the higher her chances of survival were. Katara countered with plantbending and ordered whoever was attacking to reveal themselves to the team.

Rafa and Misu, brother and sister themselves, arrived and set up camp with the group. Misu warned them that Forgetful Valley's ponds needed to remain undisturbed. She told her and Rafa's story to the team; the sibling bond they had resulted in uncertain looks from Azula and her brother. The princess cut the story short and asked about Ursa, to which Misu replied that neither she nor Rafa had seen her. As Aang prepared to cross into the Spirit World to seek out the wolf spirit, Azula walked away; when confronted by Zuko, she snapped at him, wondering if they were really going to find their mother or help "a couple of vagrants". Zuko said that it was Aang's duty to help people, and Azula accused the Fire Lord of not wanting to hold the throne anymore, traveling with Team Avatar to help people instead. Her focus quickly shifted toward her psychotic beliefs, and she accused Ursa of orchestrating Rafa and Misu's arrival to throw them off her trail. She prepared to shoot lightning at the siblings, warning her mother that her plans would fail.

Azula broke into Noren and Noriko's home through the ceiling after finding out that Noriko was really her mother, Ursa.
Her attack was thwarted by Zuko, however, and she was forced to calm down, awaiting Aang's return. When the Avatar brought the Mother of Faces with him, Azula interrupted Misu's plea to the spirit to grant her brother a new face with a demand to know about Ursa. After learning that the Mother of Faces had given Ursa a new identity as Noriko, Azula promptly took off to Hira'a with her brother and Sokka chasing after her. Barging into Noren and Noriko's house, Azula was finally able to confront her mother, demanding to know if Kiyi was supposed to be her replacement because she was such a monster. Sokka held her off temporarily, but the princess ultimately slammed Ursa to the wall and prepared a ball of fire, intent upon killing her.

She teared up when her amnesiac mother apologized for not loving her enough, but after being separated from her by Zuko, she began attacking him. Azula asked Zuko why he would not allow her to take the throne, saying he would be free of something he did not want, while it would rid her of the "incessant nagging in [her] head". Upon being told that she was wrong, Azula protested, reminding him that he had the opportunity to throw her over the cliff and be rid of both her and the letter. Zuko answered that he knew the throne was his destiny and went on to say that no matter how messy their relationship was, she was still his sister. Azula, in tears, burned an opening through a nearby wall and ran outside, dropping the letter in the process. She ran off toward the Forgetful Valley, calling her brother weak when he begged her to stay so that he could help her and vanishing from sight. Although Zuko tried to find her in the weeks before he returned to the capital with Ursa, Ikem, Kiyi, and Team Avatar, Azula managed to remain hidden, which caused Zuko to believe that she did not want to be found.

Masquerading as the Kemurikage
Following the events in Hira'a, Azula freed several of her acquaintances and subsequently organized them as a strike team impersonating the Kemurikage.
At some point during her exile, Azula came to the conclusion that her destiny was to manipulate Zuko into a Fire Lord who ruled by fear. She also reevaluated her relationship with her family, discarding any remaining loyalty to Ozai and accepting Kiyi as a blood relation. At this point, her hallucinations had stopped. Recalling how Mai talked about Kemurikage in her sleep during a sleepover from when they were children inspired Azula to masquerade in the image of the mythical spirits to enact her plans. Azula subsequently left Forgetful Valley and helped her friends escape from a mental health facility, including Zirin. In her Kemurikage guise, Azula visited Ukano, now the leader of the New Ozai Society, and threatened him with harm if he did not depose Zuko immediately. When Ukano failed at this, Azula confronted him with making good on her promise. A terrified Ukano pleaded for a month to depose Zuko. At some point, Azula revealed her identity to Ukano, who emptied his bank account to construct a prison in the Royal Family Graveyard. In the next month, Azula and her followers began abducting children from the capital, including Tom-Tom. Unknown to Ukano, Azula was using him the entire time, having no desire to see Ozai restored to power.

Azula manipulated Ukano into doing her bidding while musing how she actually wanted to keep Zuko in power.
Some time later, Azula abducted Kiyi but was discovered by Zuko, Aang, Ty Lee, and Suki. In the ensuing fight, Azula revealed herself by shooting lightning. Zuko redirected it at her, only for Azula to redirect her lightning back at him. Azula and her cohort managed to successfully get away with Kiyi through a secret passage. After locking up her half-sister with the other children, Zirin was starting to get very impatient with Azula about keeping the children for long. However, Azula calmly asked her and the other friends to be patient, as she had a plan. Azula and Ukano discussed how keeping the children is going nowhere, and Ukano revealed that he is upset that Tom-Tom is kept as a prisoner. Azula ordered Ukano to gather his Safe Nation Society to start rioting in the streets; although Ukano did not understand how this will help Ozai become Fire Lord, Azula softly said that her father was never the plan.

Later, after the riot, Ukano said that their plan still was not making any progress and pointed out that he did everything she asked and begged for her to release the children. Azula went back on her promise, reasoning that if they are free, they will eventually tell their parents and Zuko where they had kept them, and thus she kept the key to their cell.

Later on, Azula and her friends confronted her brother, Aang, her former friends, and Kei Lo. As they battled each other, Mai's knives cut into Azula's hood. Azula mocked her about her knife-throwing skills and attacked her former friend once more. Azula explained how she heard about the Kemurikage when they were at a sleepover at Mai's, having heard her mumble about the spirits in her dreams. While resuming her attack, she thanked Mai for giving her the inspiration for their masquerade. When Kei Lo suddenly bumped into Azula from behind, she quickly grabbed him and threatened Kei Lo, and mocked Mai about her relationships. Zuko was next to intervene, firmly asking Azula to release Kei Lo, to which Azula mocked what she believed to be a depressing attempt of Zuko to win back Mai.

At the crypt of the first Fire Lord's advisor, Azula revealed that she no longer intended to depose Zuko but instead become a power behind the throne.
After exchanging a fire blast with her brother, Azula ran off into a tomb shaped like a Lion Turtle. When Zuko followed her inside, Azula explained that they were in the tomb of the first Fire Lord's most trusted adviser. As Zuko pointed out that she seemed more stable, Azula suddenly attacked him. The brief Agni Kai ended with Azula pinning Zuko to the ground and raising a fire-dagger over his face, claiming this was how it had always been between them. Zuko defiantly replied that even if Azula killed him, she would never become Fire Lord and that she should accept that fact. To his surprise, Azula released him and said that she had not only accepted it but embraced it. She revealed that the voices in her head had stopped once she realized her own true destiny: it was not to become Fire Lord herself but to shape Zuko into a more ruthless leader who ruled through strength and fear. Although Zuko points out that she has lost now that all the kidnapped children were rescued, Azula countered that she had won, claiming that, in the last twenty-four hours, she had shown exactly how ruthless and authoritarian he could be. Before she could be apprehended, she vanished in smoke while commanding Zuko to accept what she made of him.

As Zuko addressed his subjects, Azula and her comrades, all still masquerading as the Kemurikage, watched his speech from a nearby rooftop. Hearing Zuko ask for his citizens' understanding and patience as he searched for a way to be a better leader, Azula smiled and sneered "How touching" to herself. Putting her mask and hood back on, she and her cohorts disappeared once more.

Personality
Born a princess and hailed as a prodigy, Azula grew up to be narcissistic and confident. She relentlessly drilled herself toward perfection and settled for nothing less from herself or those who served her. She believed that power and domination were the defining traits of strength, and as such, would only help others if she thought there was some personal gain at stake. She had absolute confidence in her "divine right to rule", with which she believed she was born. She harbored neither pity nor mercy for those she marked as treasonous or inferior. As one who wanted nothing less than absolute control, she likewise had remarkable control of herself, seemingly able to react to any situation at a moment's notice without losing her composure.

Even in life-threatening situations, Azula remained confident, focused, and deadly.
Azula was marked by a distinct lack of empathy. Even as a child, she reacted with hostility when outdone, a trait clearly displayed when she shoved Ty Lee to the ground after the girl bested her at gymnastics. This behavior would characterize her relationship with her friends for many years. Rather then caring for them, she would manipulate them as she saw fit, such as when she intimidated Ty Lee into leaving the circus and joining her cause.

She was prone to asserting herself and her authority in a grandiose way, such as when she humiliated Long Feng in front of his former henchmen or when she threatened the captain of her ship. She also showed a need for admiration, mostly from her father, whom she emulated to a great degree, and from everyone else around her, though to a lesser extent. She reacted with despair and rage when she learned her father was going to the Earth Kingdom without her. However, Azula showed a level of fear of him, as in the novelization, Azula notes that not even she could take him in a fight.

Azula was known to have a cruel personality, showing little to no concern for others besides her father. From a very young age, Azula demonstrated sadistic aggression and a near-total lack of remorse to friends, servants, family, and animals. Her own mother, Princess Ursa, once remarked, "What is wrong with that child?" after observing her casual cruelties. Azula's first reaction to hearing of Iroh's son's death was to wonder whether this now made her father the heir to the throne. She later dismissed her uncle as a quitter and a loser when learning he had ended his six hundred day Siege of Ba Sing Se to grieve for Lu Ten. She eagerly watched Azulon proclaim Ozai's punishment for trying to claim the throne and grinned maliciously when Zuko was burned and scarred by their father. She also did not seem to care when her mother disappeared or when her grandfather died. Her cruelty was apparently infamous and extreme; when Iroh accidentally ingested the poisonous white jade flower, both he and Zuko quickly decided that they would rather seek help from the Earth Kingdom at the risk of facing certain death than the possibility of being handed over to Azula by the Fire Nation.

Even in simple games such as kuai ball, Azula thought about nothing less than absolute victory.
Azula's characteristic blue flames symbolized the power she possessed and constantly sought to increase. Her lack of compassion also accounted for her ability to create and direct lightning, the "cold-blooded fire". According to Iroh, the skill required complete control of all emotion, which would not prove difficult for Azula with her one-track mentality. Because of these skills, she was also an excellent tactician, regularly displaying cunning, perception, and resourcefulness that allowed her to take advantage of almost any situation. She possessed good self-control, facing down Long Feng and deceiving him when held captive, and could lie with a straight face and no physical reactions.

Ironically, for all her refinement and self-confidence, Azula did retain some insecurity. As a result of her sequestered life of royalty, she had developed a considerable amount of social ineptitude, particularly in her uncertainty of how to act around boys, and she frequently intimidated them during conversations. Even when attempting to flirt with Chan, her domineering and megalomaniacal personality manifested in a way that disconcerted him and prompted his recession. Her overly competitive nature surfaced during a kuai ball game, and she later admitted her jealousy over how much attention Ty Lee received from others.

Though she seemingly looked down on Zuko all throughout their entire relationship, thinking of him as a weak and whiny boy who never stood up for himself or to her especially, there were moments when her opinion of him seemed to rise briefly. During her coup at the climax of Ba Sing Se's fall, she was truly pleased by Zuko's choice to aid her, musing that Zuko had always meant to be a Prince of the Fire Nation fighting by her side. Almost immediately after, however, his hesitation to fight Katara caused her disdain to surface, thinking of him as poor and weak for letting himself be goaded so easily. Nevertheless, when Zuko showed doubts about his actions in helping take Ba Sing Se but betraying Iroh, she truly did feel that he had accomplished his ultimate achievement, while at the same time feeling pity for the fact that he could not understand the significance of what his actions entailed.
Azula was never happy with what she had, always striving for more. After conquering Ba Sing Se, she passed it on to a puppet ruler to be used by the Fire Nation. When she was doubtful that she had really managed to kill the Avatar, she let her brother take the credit for the perceived kill, convinced he knew a way that Aang could survive that she did not. She was always trying to get more to try and fill what she lacked, but it was never enough. In a sense, she was a person without a finish line.

Later, Azula began to show signs of a fragile mentality. For all of her self-assurance, she was momentarily driven into a rage when Mai betrayed her by helping Zuko to escape and admitted to loving him more than she feared Azula. As Azula moved to strike her down, she was, in turn, temporarily paralyzed by Ty Lee. After her friends were apprehended, the enraged princess ordered both of them to be locked away and "left to rot". While it was apparent that Azula held herself in high regard above her friends, their sudden betrayal drove her to the edge for an instant, hinting at just how unstable she would later prove to be. This betrayal affected her so much that she lost her normally cool demeanor, as evident when she later attacked the Western Air Temple. She was erratic and maniacal, clearly trying to vent her feelings by trying to kill her brother.

While on Ember Island, Azula revealed her subtle resentment toward being seen as a "monster", particularly by her mother. Though she admittedly agreed with the viewpoint, the princess stated that it was emotionally painful nonetheless. Her time on Ember Island was also one of the few times she showed any sign of compassion for Zuko, as she followed him and urged him to return to the group when he was alone and in pain.

For a fleeting moment, Azula opened up and revealed pain and resentment about the relationship with her mother, despite her distant personality.
After being betrayed by Mai and Ty Lee, Azula's mentality continued to crumble in the final weeks of the war. When she attacked Zuko and the gang at the Western Air Temple, Azula was evidently losing her sanity, as her attacks became far more vicious, and she was seemingly obsessed with killing Zuko.
