<html><p>Kai led the group to the cave. The group, sans Tenzin, burst into the cave. Lin used her earthbending to blast a whole into the room where the airbenders and others were being held. After the captives were released from their bonds, Lin helped them get out of the cave, focusing especially on a substantially weakened Bumi and Kya, as Bolin, Mako, and Tonraq went to rescue Korra.

After everyone had emerged from the cave, they watched Korra and Zaheer duel. When Kai suggested he try and go after Zaheer, Lin told him he would have no chance because he was too powerful. The airbenders, however, combined their efforts, saving Korra and throwing Zaheer to the ground. Lin and Suyin promptly trapped Zaheer in an earth shell. The Avatar, however, had been poisoned, severely weakening her and leaving her on the verge of death. When Zaheer began laughing, Lin asked what was funny; she was told the Red Lotus had been successful. Because of the poison's metallic structure, however, they had a chance to save her. The police chief watched with worry as her sibling attempted to bend the poison out, though ultimately, she succeeded. She also gave Bolin a weird look after stuffing his sock in a ranting Zaheer's mouth.

Lin placed a comforting hand on Korra's shoulder, telling her to hang on as things would get better.
Two weeks later on Air Temple Island, Lin joined her half-sister, Tenzin and his family, Korra's family, Lord Zuko, and President Raiko, watching as Asami brought out a debilitated Korra in a wheelchair. She helped the girls, Ikki, and Meelo reach the ceremonial temple by kicking up a slab of rock and raising it to the top of the stairs. The police chief later attended Jinora's airbending mastery ceremony, smiling as Tenzin praised both the airbender and the Avatar for their efforts in saving the Air Nation and watching as Jinora's tattoos were revealed.[27]

174 AG
Preparing for Wu's coronation
Lin felt bad to tell Mako that he was to be the permanent bodyguard for Prince Wu, knowing it would displease him.
When President Raiko held a public ceremony to reopen Central City Station in 174 AG, Lin was present and guarded Prince Wu. After the ceremony ended, she tried to calm the prince's nerves about returning to the Earth Kingdom by stating that the chances he would be assassinated were almost zero. When she learned that Prince Wu had reached an agreement with President Raiko about Mako's permanent relocation to Ba Sing Se as the prince's personal bodyguard, Lin tried to protect her detective and keep him in the city, though the decision was made above her head, leaving her powerless to stop it. Later that night, she attended dinner at Air Temple Island, where she felt awkward to break the news to Mako. As an Air Acolyte alerted everyone about the arrival of a ship from the South, Lin and the others gathered at the dock to greet its passengers. However, upon learning that Korra was not among them and supposedly had left for the city six months prior though had failed to check in with any of them, everyone grew worried about the Avatar's whereabouts.[28]

Later, Lin provided security with the rest of her police force during Wu's coronation ceremony as Earth King, where she also bore witness to Kuvira's declaration of usurping power in the Earth Kingdom, which she renamed "Earth Empire".[29]

Saving her family
Lin told Opal that the world leaders were not going to attack Kuvira, so they would have to free their family themselves.
Weeks later, Lin was present at the meeting between the world leaders to decide on their course of action against Kuvira. Eager to free her family, she reiterated that Kuvira could not be trusted, since she had already broken her word before by not relinquishing power as she had said she would. She sided with President Raiko, supporting the idea to go on the offensive, and proposed to start their campaign by liberating Zaofu. After Tenzin and Fire Lord Izumi's opposition to a preemptive strike, the meeting was concluded with the decision that the United Republic would restrict itself to taking defensive measures and Lin left City Hall to find Opal. She interrupted her and Bolin's conversation, desiring to speak with her niece privately. Revealing that Raiko had failed to convince the other world leaders to attack Kuvira, Lin declared that they would have to save their family themselves, denouncing the help of anyone else, since it was an unsanctioned and dangerous mission into enemy territory and she was unwilling to let anyone else risk their lives for their family.

Torn between protecting the Avatar and saving Jinora, Lin allowed Korra and Mako to enter the Spirit Wilds, though urged them to be careful.
Before they could leave, however, Lin's presence as Republic City's Chief of Police was required at the city's Spirit Wilds, which had turned hostile and had abducted people. She ordered her officers to clear the area, put up a perimeter, and cancel all tours through the wilds. Since Jinora was among the vegetations' victims, she also ordered for someone to contact Tenzin. When Korra and Mako approached her, desiring to go into the wilds to save Jinora, Lin stated that she did not believe it was safe for anyone to venture into the spirit forest. After a vine shot out of the vegetation, emphasizing the danger the trapped people were in, Lin relented and allowed Korra to enter, though urged her to be careful.

After witnessing Jinora, Ryu, and the other tourists safely exit the Spirit Wilds, Lin retreated to Air Temple Island, where she helped Opal to prepare Juicy for their departure to Zaofu. As she loaded the last of the supplies on top of the animal, Bolin approached Opal and came along on their mission.[30]

As they arrived at Zaofu, Lin ordered Bolin to stop babbling dramatically of how he would save the Beifongs and his relationship with Opal, noting that she had already heard enough of that during their journey. Surveying the area, she noted that Kuvira had an entire battalion of troops stationed outside of the city, though realized that if they wanted to find their family, they needed to get inside Zaofu. Much to her surprise, she found her plan rejected as useless by her mother, who remarked that all the prisoners had been moved. Baffled, she greeted Toph as "chief" and was in return acknowledged in the same fashion. When Bolin started to squeal due to being in Toph's presence, Lin placed a hand to her temple, severely annoyed with the young man's antics. Attributing his babbling to him being an actor, Lin asked her mother how she knew Suyin had been captured and learned that she had kept an eye on Zaofu via the vines of the Foggy Swamp. After Toph added that their family had already been moved to a prison camp and Bolin pinpointed its location to be that of a nearby factory and reeducation facility, they all boarded Juicy and moved out.

Lin harbored a grudge toward her mother for never revealing any personal information in regards to the identity of her father.
En route to the factory, Lin specified to Bolin that her mother's mention of a "little while now, couple years" since she had seen Lin was in fact twenty years. When Toph changed the subject to her wonder that Lin had come to save Suyin, Lin revealed that she and Suyin had worked out their grievances with each other, though when Toph joyously noted that she was glad they could put that behind them, Lin scowled at the idea, harboring a grudge toward her mother.

Arriving at the factory, they all sneaked in and when Toph used her seismic sense to deduce Suyin and her family were being kept in a cavern underneath the factory, as she could sense the mecha tanks, Lin verified her claim, confirming the presence of soldiers guarding a seemingly empty cavern. Not sensing their family, she deduced that they were kept in a suspended prison that prevented them from earthbending. When Kuvira entered the hangar, they all hid and overheard her conversation with Baatar Jr. and Zhu Li. Retreating to the hills surrounding the facility, the foursome decided to postpone their rescue mission until the next day after Bolin reasoned that the most ideal moment to strike would be during the testing of the spirit energy cannon, since Kuvira desired to have all the troops and workers present, which would leave the factory mostly deserted.

As she had not spoken with Toph for twenty years, Lin had a lot of unresolved issues with her mother, specifically in regards to the identity of her father.
During dinner, Lin kept a distant attitude while Bolin and Toph talked. She sarcastic jabbed that Toph was indeed a "real sensitive instructor", when her mother stated that even a "blockhead" like Bolin could have learned metalbending given the right instruction, and scoffed at their conversation, noting that Toph was "real encouraging", when she had complimented Bolin on the possibility of being talented after all. As Bolin asked Toph who Lin's father was, Lin shot him a deadly look. When Toph casually answered that he was a nice man named Kanto with whom it did not work out, Lin was ordered to say whatever it was she wanted to say so they could "get it over with", since Toph could sense her daughter's "enraged breathing". Infuriated even more by that comment, Lin snapped at her mother that growing up without a father and never even discussing him weighed heavily on her. She added that she had entertained the thought of reaching out to the elderly earthbender after having reconciled with Suyin though concluded that now they were together again, she remembered why they had stopped talking in the first place, since Toph infuriated her and did not know or care why. She declared to not wanting anything more to do with her after they had saved Suyin, a decision Toph solemnly accepted if that was what made her happy.

With the assistance of Toph and Bolin, Lin managed to free Suyin and her family.
The following day, after Opal alerted them that the demonstration was about to start, Lin, Toph, and Bolin burrowed themselves a tunnel toward the underground cavern where the Beifong family was being held captive. Toph and Bolin catapulted Lin atop the cell, where she fashioned a blade out of her armor and cut a hole in the wood through which the prisoners could escape. Using her cables, she swung her nephews over to Toph and Bolin, where the latter would catch them to ensure a safe landing. Everything went well, until the acrophobic Baatar refused to leave the prison and requested to be left behind, forcing Lin to forcefully grab hold of him and swing him over to Bolin. His screams alerted the guards to their presence and although she and Suyin managed to exit the cell in time, they were too late to swing to safety by the cables themselves and were attacked by a mecha suit. To escape, Lin cut two of the ropes suspending the prison and grabbed a hold of Suyin, pulling her out of the way of a flamethrower attack and letting the entire structure swing toward the other side of the chasm. Right before they would slam against the wall, the two sisters jumped inside the tunnel, where the rest of their family was waiting for them.

Despite their fierce resistance, Lin, Suyin, Wei, and Wing found themselves surrounded and outnumbered by Kuvira's soldiers.
Resurfacing and reuniting with Opal, Lin urged them all to move out. When Bolin learned that Zhu Li had been chained up in the abandoned town that was to be blown up by the cannon and wanted to save her, Lin tried to reason with him that it was too dangerous now that they had been discovered. After Bolin and Opal left on Juicy to the town, Lin agreed with Suyin that it was possibly their best chance to take down Kuvira and destroy the cannon. As such, she left with her, Wei, and Wing toward the testing area. Just as the spirit energy cannon fired its deadly beam at the abandoned town to which Opal and Bolin had traveled, they used their earthbending to rattle the piece of artillery, distorting the beam's trajectory and causing it to miss the town. Working with her sister and nephews, Lin barraged Kuvira's soldiers with rocks and boulders. While Suyin left to battle Kuvira one-on-one, Lin and the twins erected a protective barrier around them. She lowered the shield to allow Wing to reel in Wei after he had gone to save Suyin, though soon found their entire defensive circle being brought down by Kuvira's troops. Although Lin prepared to continue fighting, she found herself outnumbered and surrounded. Before the battle could proceed, however, they were saved by Toph, who shifted the earth underneath the feet of their aggressors, bringing them all down. As Opal returned on Juicy, Lin escaped to safety with the rest of her family, Bolin, and Zhu Li.

Both apologizing for their mistakes, Lin reconciled with Toph.
Landing in a bamboo forest, Lin thanked her mother for having come to her rescue and apologized for all she had said the previous night. When Toph acknowledged that she had not been the best mother, though was nonetheless proud of the women her daughters had become, hoping they could find it in their hearts to not hate her, Lin accepted her words and embraced her mother. Their moment was ruined by Bolin, however, who joined in on their hug, while emphasizing the importance of family. Neither woman appreciated his intervention and Lin shoved him back after Toph had freed herself from his embrace. After her mother started on her journey back to the swamp, Lin was shocked to hear Zhu Li report that Kuvira planned to attack Republic City two weeks later.[5]

Defending Republic City
Having returned to Republic City, Lin, Suyin, Bolin, and Zhu Li immediately set course for City Hall, where they interrupted a meeting between President Raiko, Avatar Korra, Prince Wu, Mako, and Tenzin. After Zhu Li announced that Kuvira planned to attack two weeks later, Lin stated that she expected Kuvira to come via the rail lines, reasoning she would need them to transport her heavy spirit energy cannon, prompting Korra and Raiko to agree to cut them.

Lin was impressed with Wu's calming speech to the people of Republic City.
After Raiko made the evacuation of the city mandatory, Lin, Mako, and Wu traveled toward the police headquarters, where Mako inadvertently started a panic among the citizens by alerting them via the emergency broadcast line of the imminent attack on the city and confusing them with the evacuation instructions, much to Lin's annoyance. As Wu took over, she was impressed with how he managed to calm the people down and stop the influx of calls, noting that he would make a good king after all.

A week later, Lin reasoned with Raiko that Air Temple Island was the ideal location for his base of operations and he would be safe there. When Team Avatar revealed the next day that Kuvira's arrival was only hours away and a week ahead of schedule, Lin was ordered to contact General Iroh and alert him of the new developments, as they needed to lock down the city.

Retreating to the tower, Lin and Raiko were shocked to witness the arrival of the enormous mecha suit carrying the spirit energy cannon, despite having been briefed about its size. After Kuvira used her cannon to sink the United Forces battleships in a matter of seconds and aimed the weapon at the United Forces ground troops, threatening to kill them, Raiko sadly told Lin that he had no choice but to surrendered the city.

Lin and Raiko awaited the arrival of Baatar Jr. at Air Temple Island together, though when the crew of his airship continued to whisper among themselves, Lin called them out on it and they revealed that they did not know where Baatar Jr. was.

Moments later, Lin witnessed how Kuvira blew up the Future Industries factory where Avatar Korra, Suyin, and their allies were located. She promptly ordered Officer Song to keep the president safe, while she left to check for survivors.[31]

While Asami and Varrick adjusted the prototypes of the hummingbird mecha suits, Lin and the other benders decided to take on Kuvira and her army by themselves.
Arriving at the ruins of the factory, Lin was pleased to find that everyone had made it out and readily agreed with Korra that the world was not safe as long as Kuvira wielded the spirit energy cannon, declaring they had to take down the enormous mecha suit that day. While Asami and Varrick attempted to adapt the prototypes of the hummingbird mecha suits in Asami's office to get them airborne, she and the other benders faced Kuvira and her army in an attempt to stop them or at the very least, slow them down. As they ran past a paint store in the city, Lin asked Meelo what he was doing after he blew down the door of the establishment, only to be informed that he had just thought of a way to take on the enormous mecha suit.

Lin, Wei, Wing, Bolin, and Mako watched in worry from the cover of an alley how the airbenders assaulted Kuvira's machine with paint balloons, covering its windows and obscuring the vision of the pilots. Upon Tenzin's signal, Lin used her cables to fling herself on the mecha suit's right foot and attempted to bend its joints, though soon discovered that they too were made out of platinum, which was impervious to her bending. When Kuvira shot her cannon at the airbenders who had attempted to blow the suit off balance, Lin rushed to Opal's side, who had been rendered unconscious due to being knocked down by the energy emanating from the beam that nearly hit her.

Working together with Suyin and Bolin, Lin toppled a building atop Kuvira's enormous mecha suit.
While the others retreated to Asami's office, Lin made her way toward Republic City prison and released Hiroshi Sato from his cell. Taking him back to Future Industries Tower, she explained to everyone that he, as a genius engineer, could help them with their attempts to bring Kuvira down, though emphasized to Hiroshi that he would be incarcerated again as soon as the battle was over if the prison was still standing. With his help, a new plan was formed: the benders would once again try to stall Kuvira's advance, while Asami, Hiroshi, Varrick, and Zhu Li equipped the hummingbird mecha suits with plasma saws and, as soon as the suits were operational, the benders would relentlessly attack the mecha suit to distract Kuvira and enable the two hummingbird mecha suits to land on the enormous machine and cut a hole in it without being crushed. As such, while standing atop a building and working together with Suyin and Bolin, Lin severed the top stories of a large building and toppled it on Kuvira's mecha suit. While the machine was buried under the rubble, she used her metal cables to lower herself back to the street, where Korra, Wei, and Wing where awaiting them; they were all shocked, however, to discover that the mecha suit uncovered itself without so much as a scratch. As Kuvira resumed her rampage, Lin saw the metal cables of her nephews being severed by an energy beam, causing them to plummet down, and instantly made her way over to them, catching the two before they crashed to the ground. She was subsequently saved herself from being crushed by falling debris by Suyin, who erected an earth tent for cover. After Hiroshi Sato was crushed to death by Kuvira upon completing his mission of cutting a hole in the suit's armor, Lin grabbed a hold of Bolin and rappelled them both atop the machine with her metal cables. As Korra used her waterbending to prevent the mecha suit from crushing them, Lin managed to dive inside the hole together with Suyin, Bolin, Mako, and Korra.[32]

Together with Suyin, Lin destroyed the loading mechanism of Kuvira's spirit energy cannon from within.
Inside, Lin was ordered by Korra to climb up to the weaponized arm together with Suyin and disable the spirit energy cannon. While Bolin and Mako headed toward the engine room and Korra would take on Kuvira, the Beifong sisters used their cables to quickly ascend toward the right arm of the machine. Upon arrival, they were immediately attacked by a guard, who barraged them with metal strips. While ripping a plate from the wall and use it as cover, Lin ordered her sister to disable the weapon while she would take care of the guard. She resolutely jumped down to the platform of her adversary and bent two metal sword out of the wrists of her uniform; she used those to knock aside the incoming projectiles, before retracting them in favor of her cable. After trading some punches with the other metalbender, she managed to overpower her and made her way back to Suyin, complimenting her on having torn down the cannon's loading mechanism, causing the spirit vine power cores to explode within the arm. As Suyin noted that although the outside of the mecha suit was constructed out of platinum, the inside was metallic, making it vulnerable to their metalbending, the sisters worked together to cause as much damage as they could, effectively disabling the weapon and severing Kuvira's connection to the arm as a whole. They were roughly thrown against the metal wall, however, as Kuvira ripped the now useless arm off the suit and tossed it away; Lin saved Suyin and herself from being flung free by bending the interior wall around them to strap them in, though was rendered unconscious by the shock caused when the arm crashed into a building.

Lin handcuffed Kuvira after she surrendered and led her away with Suyin, so the Earth Empire commander could be held responsible for her actions.
After they recovered, Lin and Suyin made their way to the Spirit Wilds, which had been blasted open when Kuvira had fired the spirit energy cannon from within the vegetation and now housed a new spirit portal. Realizing Korra and Kuvira were nowhere to be found, Lin and the rest of Team Avatar set out to search the area for the Avatar. She watched in surprise when the spirits emerged a few moments later from the spirit portal, followed by Korra and Kuvira. After Kuvira surrendered, Lin handcuffed her and led her away with Suyin's help.

Lin later attended Zhu Li and Varrick's wedding on Air Temple Island, sitting between Tenzin and Suyin; although she smiled when the couple sealed their union with a kiss, she did not applaud like the other guests. During the dinner party, Lin stood by herself on the side and took one of the offered food sticks, though eyed it warily.[33]

Investigating the triads
Lin and Mako manipulated Two Toed Ping into revealing Tokuga's name and plans.
In the chaotic aftermath of Kuvira's failed invasion of the United Republic of Nations, Lin and her police force had their hands full investigating the triads ravaging the city, as the different factions engaged each other in turf wars over the land that was not destroyed during the invasion. When the Triple Threat Triad attacked the Creeping Crystals, Lin and her officers interfered. Although many triad members escaped, Lin managed to capture a fleeing Viper with her metal cables and arrest him. She ordered her men to bring all the captured gangsters in for booking at their temporary police station and prepare them for questioning.

Back at the station, Lin questioned Two Toed Ping about the identity of the Triple Threats' new leader but quickly grew tired of his stubborn silence. Not making any progress, Mako approached her and suggested to trick Ping by telling him he had been identified by another triad member as the mastermind of the earlier fight. Although Lin had her doubts that the tactic would work, she went along with the idea and learned that the true mastermind had been Tokuga, the Triple Threats' new leader. As Ping continued to explain how Tokuga rose to power, she quickly realized that he was more dangerous than they had thought and declared him to be their first priority.[34]

Lin later read Bolin's report on the Triple Threats' attack on the spirit portal, expressing surprise at Korra and Asami's relationship and asking Bolin to improve his penmanship. Mako informed her that he and Korra believed Tokuga was hired by Wonyong Keum as he had threatened the airbenders to evacuate his property. Lin rejected the plan to bring Keum in for questioning, as she would not question such a well-connected man without hard evidence.

At the docks, Lin led a recon team to investigate the Triple Threats' warehouse, using her seismic sense to check the interior. She kicked down the door and ordered those present to freeze but soon realized that they were looking at mannequins planted as a diversion. As the mannequins began to detonate, Lin and her force fled for their lives. In the aftermath, Lin promised to Mako and Bolin that she would not let Tokuga outsmart them again. When the police depot came under attack by the Triple Threats, Lin radioed Mako to order in every available task force member.[35]

Lin came to the scene after Korra and her allies had the Triple Threats surrounded. She denied the Avatar's request for them to go after Tokuga, as he was threatening to turn the neighborhood to rubble if they moved in. She tried to reassure Korra that everything would turn out well, in spite of Asami's kidnapping. She would stand by to guard the area while Team Avatar brought an end to Tokuga's insurrection.[36]

Personality
Much like her mother, Lin is quite comfortable letting others know when she is displeased.
On the surface, Lin is tough, uncompromising, and blunt. As Chief of Police, she has a no-nonsense attitude, apprehending anyone who breaks the law, regardless of position, familial relationship or intent; as such, she was quick to arrest her own sister after she was involved in a robbery and condemn the Avatar when she destroyed public and private property in an attempt to apprehend the three Triple Threat Triad members by herself. Lin believes that the only way to maintain peace and stability in Republic City is through the use of military might and treats the city's laws with great respect, enforcing them with unyielding ferocity, even to the point where she felt the Avatar's presence could potentially compromise the city's safety.[37]

Much of her uptight and guarded personality stemmed from her childhood frustrations with her mother: Toph's "hands-off" parenting style and continuous refusal to disclose the identity of Lin's father, or even discuss anything related to him, greatly infuriated her.[5] This, combined with her belief that Suyin's rebellious personality brought dishonor to the family name[1] and her painful breakup with Tenzin, made Lin put up barriers to shield herself from the pain of personal relationships going awry. This led others to describe her as "challenging"[10] and a bitter loner who kept her grievances to herself.[6]

Lin apologized to Opal and opened up to the young airbender, revealing a more compassionate aspect of her character.
Despite her gruff and indifferent exterior, Lin has a softer facet to her personality. Following the battle at the Pro-bending Arena, Lin became less harsh toward Tenzin and Korra.[4] Despite initially struggling to do so, she was also not above opening up during intimate moments, as evidenced when she had a private talk with Opal, openly disclosing her hostile history with her mother. Immediately after, Lin assumed the role of the encouraging aunt for her niece, suggesting her niece should hone her new airbending skills under Tenzin's tutelage.[1] Lin also inherited her mother's candid sense of humor and sarcasm, expressing her displeasure with back-handed compliments, such as when she congratulated Korra for instigating the Water Tribe Civil War,[8] chastised Korra for leaving her at Zaofu, and when Naga licked her in joy.[24]

Lin is incredibly loyal and selfless to her friends and allies, to the point where she would willingly sacrifice herself and her goals to help them in their time of need. She forfeited her chance to capture Amon to save Avatar Korra's life[4] and accepted Tenzin's request to help protect his family without hesitation, for whom she let herself be captured in an attempt to secure their escape. When she was given the chance to sell Korra out to keep her bending, she blatantly refused.[38] After patching things up with Suyin,[1] Lin's display of heroism extended to her sister and her family, going as far as embarking an unsanctioned mission to save them after being held captive by Kuvira.[30]

Abilities
Earthbending
Like her renowned mother, Lin has mastered earthbending to a similar level. She is equally proficient in the traditional Hung Gar earthbending style and her mother's self-taught Chu Gar Praying Mantis style. She is able to easily elevate multiple large boulders simultaneously, as well as launch herself high up into the air.

Lin used seismic sense to detect Hiroshi Sato's secret workshop.
Lin has also demonstrated a great mastery over the seismic sense technique, which allows her to detect the layout of the surrounding area and the people within it with great accuracy and detail. Thus, she is easily able to locate subterranean structures, as well as determine with accuracy who is within the general vicinity. For example, while on the hunt for her captured officers, she was able to pinpoint their presence within an Equalist hideout, but also perceive that Korra was absent. She could also sense the mechanism of a locked door without physically perceiving it in order to open it with her bending. Like Toph, Lin's ability is limited without direct skin contact, requiring her to either use her hands or retract the soles on her boots.

Metalbending
Lin used metalbending to destroy an Equalist airship.
As the chief of the Metalbending Police Force, Lin is especially proficient in the specialized art of metalbending. She is able to rip metal beams or floors from their bearings and single-handedly tear apart an airship's metal hull. For more general use, Lin uses her standard retractable metal cables, which are highly versatile in battle. With them, she is able to perform considerable feats of acrobatics, easily maneuvering around cavernous locations, such as the Pro-bending Arena. She can also fashion them as wrist blades for close-quarters combat. Lin has also performed intricate and otherwise delicate metalbending as well, from unlocking metal handcuffs from a distance to wrapping her armor around herself, and even closing up Bolin's zipper.[14] Despite all this, her mother, Toph, did not believe Lin picked up all the specifics of metalbending.[29]

Other skills
Lin is extremely agile and resilient, exhibited by her quick recovery from a chi blocker attack and, in the same move, somersaulting upright and taking down two chi blockers. She was likewise still able to effectively maneuver and fight on par with Suyin despite being visibly exhausted at the time. Her reflexes are great enough that she can subdue multiple chi blockers by herself. She has also shown considerable skill in aim, as she was able to snap Tarrlok's gavel from across a large room with one of her metal cables without touching him with the cable. Lin is also a capable driver and pilot, being able to navigate a police car through crowded streets in pursuit of the Terra Triad and man an airship by herself.

Despite not being able to see through Varrick's ruse during the Water Tribe Civil War,[16] Lin possesses decent detective skills, making her a valuable member of the police force. She also put her skills to use to track down Team Avatar after they left Zaofu to chase Zaheer.[23]

Trivia
She was first announced on July 23, 2011 at San Diego Comic-Con, and is the second named child of a member of (the original) Team Avatar to appear, the first being Tenzin.
Chief Beifong's appearance bears a greater resemblance to her grandmother Poppy Beifong than to her mother, at least as seen in the Avatar: The Last Airbender series.
Lin was responsible for updating the metal cables on the police uniform from being in their belts to being in spools on their backs.[39]
Lin Beifong's character design, aside from her personality, was partially inspired by Han Young Ja, the general manager at Studio Mir, and longtime friend and colleague of Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino.[40]
Lin's "tough and natural beauty" was partially inspired by Marlene Dietrich, a German actress and singer.[41]
When Korra was frustrated with her inability to airbend, she tried directing an airbending attack at a newspaper hanging on a line with an image of Lin on the front page inciting the mutual dislike between Korra and Lin. When she failed to blast it away, she set fire to it instead.[42]
Lin is the first person in The Legend of Korra to use seismic sense, but the third in both series. The first one to use this was Toph, who later taught it to Aang.
Despite being an earthbending master, Lin appears to heavily favor metalbending.
Lin is the first known female victim of bending removal, the first person to have their bending restored by Korra, and only the second person to have their bending restored by an Avatar.
It was confirmed by the creators that Lin did not want to have children and that this difference of opinion with Tenzin hurt their relationship.[43]
Lin Beifong's decision to fight outside the law is ironic, since she showed no patience for people who would use vigilante justice against criminals.[10]
In response to a flood of questions about the identity of Lin's father, Colin Heck jokingly replied in his Tumblr blog that her father was Azula, stating it to be "really complicated".[44]
Lin Beifong is the second known individual to have been scarred in the face by a family member, the first being Zuko. However, unlike Zuko's scar, her scars were inflicted by accident.
