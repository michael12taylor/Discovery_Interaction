<html><p>Suyin later joined her family, Korra, and Kuvira for a meal together. When Wei and Wing raised why the Metal Clan could not simply take down Guan's army in Gaoling, she told them that they could not be seen as aggressors, noting that the democratic movement could be thrown into turmoil should Zaofu intervene in another state's elections. Toph despaired at the already weak state of the movement, noting that Guan had likely brainwashed both the voters and the Earth King. Suyin shut down Opal and Kuvira's argument over Guan's plan to brainwash Wu and reiterated that they needed to let the vote go forward and see it play out. Toph told her daughter not to get her hopes up, noting that she essentially forfeited the election as soon as they left Gaoling, and believing Guan's victory to be almost certain. However, Baatar Jr. entered, noting that if he could restore Asami's mind, then he could use the knowledge to free the brainwashed citizens, Kuvira and Suyin adding that Guan would lose all support once they realized what he did to them, leading to Toph's victory, which her mother sarcastically cheered.

Suyin later came to Asami's quarters and informed her and Korra that Baatar Jr. was ready to begin the process. She was present through the multiple unsuccessful attempts to free Asami's mind. When Baatar Jr. considered testing the process on a subject who had not been brainwashed, Suyin cautioned Kuvira from it after she volunteered, but she was resolute to go ahead, stating that she was responsible for defeating Guan and the Earth Empire.

After Baatar Jr. had what he needed from Kuvira, Asami's brainwashing was successfully undone the next time they tried the process. However, Opal, Wei, and Wing rushed in, asking their mother to turn on the radio, as Guan had unexpectedly won the election by having Wu move up the election date. While Toph nonchalantly dismissed her loss, Suyin told her that it was not funny, as Guan had outright stolen the election and had used the Earth King to help him do it. President Moon planned to discuss the situation with Suyin and other world leaders.

Suyin later entered Korra and Asami's bedroom, informing them that the guards outside Kuvira's bedroom had been left unconscious, and she had stolen a Metal Clan plane and escaped Zaofu. As the three women moved outside the estate, she asked Korra if she had any ideas where Kuvira may have gone. The Avatar speculated that Kuvira was returning to Gaoling, having been livid when Guan refused to surrender to her.

Suyin, Korra, Asami, and Toph flew to Gaoling, guided by Opal on Juicy. Suyin spotted Kuvira's plane with her telescope but could not see her. Opal asked her mother to admit that Kuvira had taken advantage of her goodwill and betrayed her again. Suyin told her that they did not know for sure and that she would give Kuvira the benefit of the doubt until she learned otherwise, to Opal's chagrin. Her mother then told her to make a pass over the city so she could try to spot her. Suyin spotted Kuvira at the reeducation camp, noting that she was in trouble, as a brainwashed Mako and Bolin began to attack her. Suyin prepared to fight alongside her mother and daughter and disabled a mecha suit by wrapping its legs in metal cables. Suyin found Kuvira levitating a sharp piece of metal, ready to kill Guan, but advised her to stop, telling her that his death would not solve anything, nor would it give Kuvira peace. She accepted the truth of Suyin's words and spared Guan's life while successfully getting him to surrender and have the Earth Empire army stand down.

Suyin was present outside Gaoling City Hall when Wu gave his speech proclaiming that the Earth Empire would need more time to move to democracy, with each state setting its own timetable according to its citizens' wishes.

Suyin assures Kuvira that she will always be a member of the Beifong family.
Suyin and her family returned to Republic City once more when Kuvira's trial resumed. Suyin was delighted when Kuvira confessed to all her charges, entering a guilty plea. As White Lotus sentries escorted her outside the courtroom, she approached Kuvira, apologizing, raising that she could have guided her along a different path was she a better mentor and mother. Kuvira told her that she should be the sorry one, and thanked Suyin for taking her in and never abandoning her even at her worst. The two women embraced, Kuvira wishing they had more time. Suyin told her that they would, as President Moon and the tribunal agreed to release her into Suyin's custody under house arrest for her remorse and her actions in ending Guan and the Earth Empire. The Beifong's gathered around Kuvira, as Opal told her that despite not being born a Beifong, she would always be a part of their family.

Personality
Suyin holds a deep love for her family.
A direct opposite of Lin's uptight and blunt personality, Suyin was a more carefree and upbeat individual who acts akin to her mother in both their youths. She enjoys many hobbies as a means to express herself and is also very open with her opinion, showing personal distaste for political control being centered around royalty. She also has a deep love for family, even for her estranged half-sister and eldest son.

She is very much a humanist in her beliefs, seeing the potential in other people and encouraging them to pursue their passions and talents to the ultimate extent of their capabilities. She does a good job of this, especially in regards to encouraging her very diverse children and their respective interests: from her eldest son's engineering projects with her architect husband to Huan's sculpting career, Wei and Wing's athletics, and her daughter Opal's airbending. In addition, Suyin believes in giving others a second chance at redemption, as she does with Varrick even though he is a wanted fugitive, and was willing to do the same with her estranged son, Baatar Jr. However, she did not offer Aiwei such leniency following his personal betrayal of her and Zaofu, nor did she forgive Kuvira for usurping power in the Earth Kingdom and causing a rift in her family. As a progressive humanist who favors technology as the driving factor for a nation, she does not believe in spreading change through subjugation and opposed those who claim power they are not entitled to for themselves.

Realizing that many of her youthful troubles stemmed from her mother allowing her and Lin too much freedom when they were younger, Suyin is more controlling and protective of her own children, much as her grandparents had been to Toph. She did, however, accept that she had perhaps been too controlling after Opal decided to leave home to train at the Northern Air Temple.

When dangerous matters arise, she is extremely loyal to her allies, willing to help them in any way as long as she believes they are doing the right thing. However, she is not above going behind their backs, as she helped Team Avatar load a jeep full of supplies so they could track down Aiwei and the Red Lotus despite Lin having protested the plan. Suyin is willing to do whatever it takes to keep those that she holds dear safe, as she attempted to take out Kuvira on her own despite Korra's efforts at negotiating a peaceful solution.

Abilities
Earthbending
Like her mother and half-sister, Suyin is a proficient earthbender, having mastered both the traditional style and its sub-skill, metalbending; she is able to seamlessly shift between styles or utilize both in perfect unison during battle. She is capable of maneuvering her way through a barrage of earth projectiles with no wasted movement, as well as employing the seismic sense technique with precision.

Metalbending
Suyin is capable of using earth and metalbending simultaneously during battle.
Suyin's prowess in metalbending enabled her to construct an entire city out of metal. She also has great precision, able to curve several metal shards in the air in order to pierce a glider staff and fashion armor out of a metal plate. Her control over metal is also fine enough to bend even liquid metal that she cannot see, as exemplified by her bending most of the mercury out of Korra's body. Suyin could also use her metalbending to great use in combat, even holding her own against Kuvira in a lengthy fight, though the younger metalbender did eventually overpower her. Furthermore, her mother, Toph, did not believe Suyin picked up all the specifics of metalbending.

Other skills
Suyin rehearsed with her dance troupe for an upcoming performance.
A skilled dancer, Suyin is extremely agile, graceful, and resilient, maintaining both her balance and posture while swinging down a metal cable in synchronization with her dance troupe. She regularly integrated her agility and acrobatic skills into her fighting, effortlessly launching herself around the battlefield and making herself a difficult target. She was even able to keep up with younger opponents such as Kuvira, herself a highly skilled metalbender, and dodge multiple combustion blasts from P'Li.

Suyin is also a skilled tactician, able to plan battle strategies and pick out key points of attacks, which she demonstrated in her and her metalbenders' attempt to rescue Korra from the Red Lotus. She is also versed in bōjutsu and familiar with healing arts to a certain extent.
