<html><p>The tipping point came during her father's coronation as the Phoenix King, where Azula was told she would not assist in the attack on the Earth Kingdom. Azula seemed distraught at this and took this decision as an offense to her and her honor. For her, Ozai always represented absolute power and perfection, qualities which she desired to acquire. His refusal to bring her along on a mission where the two of them would serve essentially as equals made her realize that her lust for power not only frightened her enemies but perhaps her father as well. Ozai responded by appointing Azula as the new Fire Lord to govern over the Fire Nation in his absence, temporarily satisfying her desire for power. However, she was unable to cope with the fact that the only human being who may have ever loved her was not only ashamed of her but still possessed power over her. Her father was the last person Azula thought she could trust, and Ozai's refusal to include her in his final conquest only served to cause Azula more inner pain. Knowing that her father would neither submit to her will nor love her, Azula's grip on reality began to steadily plummet.

Azula's flawless demeanor was shattered by the unanticipated betrayal of Mai.
On the day of her coronation, Azula became excessively paranoid and gave into her fear of betrayal and being killed. She accused her servant of purposely leaving a pit in her cherry so that she would choke and got angry at the Dai Li when they arrived five minutes after they had been summoned, suggesting that their laxness could have allowed an assassin to sneak in, kill her, and "be on his merry way". Musing over the possibility that the Dai Li could betray and kill her, Mai and Ty Lee's treason still fresh in memory, she banished them.

It also appeared that she was not sleeping well, as she had dark circles under her eyes. Upon Lo and Li's arrival to counsel her, Azula's fear of disappointing her father was clear. She became so enraged when her old mentors proposed to postpone her coronation that she momentarily forgot they were not firebenders and ordered them to fight an Agni Kai with each other. Ultimately, Azula addressed Li as Lo and banished her, leaving the sisters confused as to which of them had to leave.

Having sent off her staff, she was left alone to style her own hair for the coronation. Frustrated by her inability to tie up her hair bun, she "fixed" the situation by cutting off a part of her hair, leaving it a tattered mess. Panting in frustration, she saw her mother in her mirror in an apparent hallucination. Ursa complimented her, saying that she always had such beautiful hair, though Azula dismissed the compliment and asked her mother why she was there. When Ursa told her that she would not miss her daughter's coronation, Azula told her not to pretend to act proud, stating that she knew her mother thought she was a monster. The hallucination of her mother refuted that, saying she did not think that, that Azula was just confused, and that she loved her. Azula could not cope with the declaration of love and threw her brush at the mirror, shattering it, before breaking down crying.

This incident exposed a complex facet to Azula's persona. Although outwardly maintaining a cold and dismissive opinion of her mother, Ursa's banishment ultimately had a devastating impact upon Azula's fragile psyche. As Azula's sanity began slipping away from her, this inability to reconcile her perceived belief that Ursa considered her a monster with the truer (though idealized but still true) maternal feelings of love and support that Ursa demonstrated in the hallucination created an inescapable conflict in Azula's mind that furthered her eventual mental collapse. Another thread of this argument explored the possibility that although she was fully capable of acting cruelly without showing any outright regret, deep down, a part of her could tell what she did was wrong and felt regret over it, but it was just her indomitable will and emotional control that prevented her from showing it for many years. Nevertheless, despite years of such dark deeds, what remained of her conscience, in the form of her mother Ursa (whose love and guidance she secretly longed for but could never have), could still manifest at this point and reared itself stronger than before. Ursa's gentle, motherly concerns over Azula's use of fear and cruelty as her only means of maintaining relationships with friends and family alike induced a violent mental breakdown prior to her coronation; after breaking the mirror, Azula collapsed and sobbed deeply before regaining any semblance of control.

Visibly unstable, Azula saw a hallucination of her mother as her sanity began to unravel.
Azula showed up at her coronation impatient and with her hair still a mess, though the event was interrupted when Katara and Zuko arrived to challenge her. She did not hesitate to challenge her brother to an Agni Kai and darkly smiled when it happened that outright indicated she was more obsessed with killing Zuko personally than tactically dealing with both Zuko and Katara when she challenged him to a one-on-one fight, considering the fact she could just have what remained of the Fire Nation army attack them. Her unstable condition shone through visibly, as Zuko could easily pick up on it, and this was shown further as her apparent madness weakened her fighting abilities for Zuko to decisively overpower her eventually. She also was instantly goaded by Zuko into using lightning despite knowing he could redirect it and only changed her mind in the last moment to avoid what would certainly have been defeat by targeting Katara, leaving Zuko incapacitated, at which point Azula showed an increasing level of mockery toward the duo. Her arrogance and mental state eventually allowed Katara, despite clearly being far less powerful than Azula due to Sozin's Comet, to defeat and chain her to the ground. The moment Azula saw Zuko rose, the Fire Nation princess screamed in anger and outrage while breathing fire uncontrollably and furiously struggling to break herself free, falling into complete insanity, sobbing loudly. She dragged herself along the ground helplessly, the full extent of her madness causing both Zuko and Katara to watch with clear sadness despite all she had put them through. This breakdown was the culmination of her failed relationship with her mother and her jealousy toward Zuko for receiving more of their mother's affection, the betrayal she suffered at the hands of Mai and Ty Lee, and finally, her defeat by Zuko and Katara. This madness earned her Zuko's pity, and Azula was spared from prison and instead committed to a mental health facility on a nearby island in the Fire Nation for potential better treatment.

Due to her mental health, Azula lost her sense of reality, causing her to act recklessly.
A year later, a clearly mentally unstable Azula accepted the task of coaxing Ursa's whereabouts out of Ozai from Zuko, stating that not one day had gone by where she had not wondered what became of their mother. In return, she requested permission to join her brother on his quest and to be allowed to travel unbound and with dignity. The Fire Lord accepted, and Azula was released. While she had regained much of her previous demeanor, as she haughtily commanded people to cater to her needs and forcefully reacted to irritating situations, though from time to time, she still suffered from psychotic episodes, thinking that everyone around her was conspiring with her mother in order to bring her down. However, she intended to find and kill Ursa in order to stop her from interfering with her plans to take the throne from Zuko. In the end, however, she abandoned both of these goals once Zuko revealed that he would care for her unconditionally no matter what. Leaving Ursa alive and giving Zuko back the letter that could potentially oust him from the throne, Azula ran off from the remainder of the group.

Azula subsequently experienced a phase which she later described as finding her "destiny". Discarding many of her old desires, including the quest for total power, she overcame several of her insecurities. Although still somewhat unhinged and obsessed with ruling by instilling fear, Azula realized that she could rule through Zuko and thereby share the burden of being Fire Lord; this resulted in her feeling freer than ever before. In addition, she allowed herself to open up more to others than ever before, describing her new comrades as "sisters" and openly telling Zuko of her schemes. By extension, her opinion of Zuko had improved greatly: Although still cruel and scathing, she insisted that he had the abilities to be "strong" like herself. Observing Zuko's public apology to the citizenry, Azula remained smug, confident that he would come around to her way of thinking in time.

Abilities
Firebending
Nine-year-old Azula flaunted her prodigious firebending skills before her grandfather.
Azula was one of the most skilled and powerful firebenders of her time, recognized as a prodigy by both Ozai and Zuko. The most notable feature of Azula's bending was her ability to create blue flames, which are much more intense than the red, orange, and yellow flames normally used by firebenders, though she was only known to bend normal colored fire during her childhood. Azula also used her flames in inventive ways, such as creating jets of flames, whirling disks, and blades of fire. She often firebent using only two fingers, rather than with a closed fist or open hand as was commonly used by other firebenders. Also notable was her ability to produce a greater amount of flames than most firebenders without tiring, and she was able to maintain successive assaults for long durations of time.

Azula demonstrated the ability to condense her flames by using two fingers, enabling her fire to cut clean through various objects. When formed into fireballs, the flames had a powerful concussive effect, able to firmly pulverize stone objects. She was also able to generate powerful shields of swirling flames that could withstand the full force of four simultaneous elemental attacks (and a boomerang). She was even able to charge up her fire before releasing it, something she used during her fight with Aang. She could easily defeat Zuko during the Confrontation at Tu Zin and keep Aang on the defensive, eventually overwhelming the Avatar, even fighting off the entire Team Avatar successfully before running when Toph arrived. Azula was even able to defeat Aang when he had mastered Air, Water, and Earthbending twice. Azula was also capable of fighting off and defeating multiple Kyoshi Warriors, using both firebending and hand-to-hand techniques.

Azula was well known for her trademark blue firebending.
The depth of Azula's potential was demonstrated in her use of advanced techniques, such as creating large blasts of flame, evaporating a wave of water that Katara threw at her, using her flames to propel herself forward like a jet, and minutes later producing and guiding lightning. While she used her firebending less after returning home, she did demonstrate her abilities a few times, such as when she used her firebending to give extra propulsion to a kuai ball during a game, creating an explosion. She also used her firebending to break free of her shackles and briefly attacked Sokka, Aang, and Toph. Azula engaged in a pitched battle with Zuko and Sokka on the gondola, where despite Zuko's vast improvement in firebending and Sokka's adept swordsmanship skills, she still managed to fight them both on reasonably even footing, countering all of Zuko's fire blasts and returning with her own and forcing her brother to dodge a charged blast from her. Her later duel with the improved Zuko ended in a standstill, with Azula deflecting all of Zuko's large and powerful fire blasts and returning with her own, before unleashing a devastating blue-fire enhanced fist attack that rivaled Zuko's own and caused a large explosion that separated them both. In addition to creating her usual powerful fire balls, she was able to shoot her flames behind her in order to propel herself through the air onto the gondola.

She was proficient in the highly difficult technique of generating lightning, a sub-skill of firebending, displaying a fine control of this skill. She could perform minute flickers of lightning, which she used to both temporarily blind Zuko or disarm Sokka of his boomerang, as well as produce large, compressed balls of lightning, as exemplified when she created such a ball to send away a swarm of moth wasps, who were attracted by the intense light. After learning of the ability to also redirect lightning, she applied herself to the technique and came to master it as well.

Azula's firebending became more dangerous under the influence of Sozin's Comet.
As Azula gradually lost her sanity prior to the arrival of Sozin's Comet, her firebending became unfocused and wild, which, combined with the Comet's empowering effects, made her all the more dangerous. However, it also resulted in her becoming exhausted more easily than usual. Despite her state of mind, she retained considerably great levels of firebending power and prowess, as shown by how she was initially able to rival Zuko's equally enhanced sheets of flame with her own amplified blue flames, before she became exhausted and had to propel herself using fire jets to continue trading blows with Zuko, ultimately being overpowered by her brother, forcing her to resort to attacking Katara with lightning to incapacitate him, and afterward was able to dominate Katara, fiercely firing wide strikes of lightning and enormous blue flame blasts as well as propelling herself quickly through the air to keep chase. However, her mental instability ultimately proved to have hindered her fighting prowess enough for Azula to finally be defeated by Katara despite at the time being far more powerful than her. She displayed the ability to breathe fire as she struggled with her chains and lost all sanity.

Intelligence
Azula realized right away that Aang wanted to trick her, telling Mai and Ty Lee to follow Appa's real trail while she fought the Avatar.
Azula was an extremely intelligent and cunning strategist. She was also a highly studious girl. Since childhood, she was well-versed in her nation's military history as she successfully recounted Fire Lord Sozin's strategy in an old battle. She planned a trap for Iroh and Zuko, which was only accidentally foiled by the captain of her ship. She immediately discerned the Avatar's plan to mislead her with a false trail. She also displayed incredible fighting prowess in learning the fighting styles of her foes, such as the sweeping wind kick ability displayed by Aang against her during the battle of the drill. She imitated it in the form of a sweeping fire kick during her battle with the Kyoshi warriors tending to Appa, utilizing that move to end her battle with Suki. With the Kyoshi warriors finally captured, Azula, Ty Lee, and Mai used their robes, stealing their identities to freely enter Ba Sing Se and the Earth King's palace, beginning her coup against the Earth King. This coup was single-handedly orchestrated by her, winning Ba Sing Se for the Fire Nation. During the Day of Black Sun, she laid a trap for Aang and his friends using Dai Li agents in the Fire Lord's throne room, ensuring that the eclipse time would be used up. She also displayed the ability to be so extremely capable of lying effectively that even Toph could not sense it regardless of how blatant the lie was, showing that Azula did not feel remorse for lying or many of her other actions. She also displayed an ability to realize whether or not someone was telling the truth, stating simply that she was a "people person".

Even under the effects of her mental illness, her wit and ability to strategize were not completely lost, as despite being excessively provoked by Zuko's taunts of fearing his lightning redirection, she still could come up with a strategy to overpower her brother by aiming the lightning at Katara instead, which succeeded in incapacitating Zuko. A year later, she managed to use the after effects of chi blocking, which caused her body joints to become extremely flexible, to free herself from her restraints and from Zuko. On another occasion, she was able to save Team Avatar from a swarm of moth wasps by using a lightning ball to attract them due to the intense light.

Azula's intelligence made her very skillful in manipulating people. She used this skill on many subjects, including her brother Zuko, her mother Ursa, Long Feng, the Dai Li, Sokka, and even her father to an extent.

Other skills
Azula made up for her handicap with dexterity and agility to evade Aang and Toph.
Azula's high-level skill in unarmed combat was displayed several times during the series. She easily avoided Zuko's frenzied knife attacks without the use of firebending, guiding his hands off course. Later, she proceeded to disarm Suki and knocked her off her feet without bending. She also had some skill with hidden weaponry, as she intended on using a shuriken knife during the eclipse. Her acrobatics and use of a hidden shuriken knife were apparently skills she picked up from Ty Lee and Mai, respectively. Azula was very agile as she was able to run up walls and perform mid-air twirls. She dodged Aang and Toph's bending attacks with little to no effort using high jumps like Ty Lee, ultimately making Aang admit she was too fast to hit. Her physical strength was also adept as she could perform a planche, supporting her body in a horizontal position just by using her arms, with little effort.

Trivia
Although she does not bend her signature blue fire, Azula is the firebender in the opening credits for Avatar: The Last Airbender.
Azula was the shadowed firebender in the original series' opening credits. Her bending, however, is orange instead of her trademark blue.
Despite being younger than her brother, Azula sometimes condescendingly referred to Zuko as "Little Zuzu".
Azula was the only known character to be able to create blue fire.
Azula was the first character to be seen generating lightning, as well as the only known female able to do so.
She is also the only known female able to redirect lightning.
She is also one of a few known individuals who can both generate and redirect lightning, the others being her Uncle Iroh, Mako, and Lightning Bolt Zolt, before he had his bending removed.
She is also the only known female able to redirect lightning.
She is also one of a few known individuals who can both generate and redirect lightning, the others being her Uncle Iroh, Mako, and Lightning Bolt Zolt, before he had his bending removed.
Azula is also only the second person to be able to lie to Toph without her being able to sense it, the first being Old Sweepy.
Forms of the word azul appear in several languages, including Spanish, Filipino, Galician, and Portuguese, all having the meaning of blue, which matches her trademark blue firebending.
Azula's voice actress, Grey DeLisle, also voiced Ta Min, Roku's wife and Azula's great grandmother.
Azula displays symptoms similar to those of paranoid schizophrenia, a mental disorder characterized by delusions and hallucinations with an impending sense of doom and paranoia.
If Katara had not managed to revive Aang with spirit water, Azula would have been the first person to have broken the Avatar Cycle.
Azula was one of the few characters to have theme music that played when she entered a scene.
Concept art of Azula from Avatar: The Last Airbender—The Art of the Animated Series.
Although Azula was a firebending prodigy, her masters, Lo and Li, were not firebenders at all.
The only person to whom Azula was ever known to apologize was Ty Lee, after hurting her feelings by calling her a tease.
Although she was a usurper and never officially crowned, Azula remains as one of two known Earth Queens in history and the only known ruler of the Earth Kingdom without such heritage.
Azula was originally supposed to have an arranged marriage in Book Three, but the idea was scrapped.
Azula was the only named female firebender seen in the first series, with the exception of the female Avatars.
Azula was born in the Year of the Snake, which seems to suit her personality very well. Those born in the Year of the Snake tend to be "graceful, intelligent, vain, analytical, scheming, and vicious".
Azula's firebending contains elements from the chāquán system.
Azula is one of only three known female members of the Fire Nation Royal Family by blood, the others being Izumi and her daughter.
Azula was originally going to wear armor with a heavy phoenix theme, but the idea was scrapped.
Dark Horse editor Rachel Roberts has considered the possibility of Azula featuring in The Legend of Korra graphic novels, imagining that "she's kept tabs on her brother all these years, and scoffs over her morning paper whenever he's mentioned."
Rangi's appearance is based on Azula's appearance, with some differences being that Rangi doesn't care much about having some hairs out of place.






Notes
 Avatar Extras for "The Crossroads of Destiny" on Nicktoons Network refers to Azula as "Earth Queen Azula", indicating that despite her foreign ancestry, Azula was recognized as the successor to the Earth Kingdom throne during an indeterminate period of time between her coup and the eventual restoration of Kuei, following the end of the war.

 After Azula left Ba Sing Se, the throne of the Earth King became vacant, while Joo Dee was appointed the de-jure ruler of Ba Sing Se as "Supreme Bureaucratic Administrator" and Fire Lord Ozai became the de-facto ruler of the Earth Kingdom. However, Earth King Kuei eventually returned to his rightful position in summer 100 AG, ending the interregnum.
