<html><p>Suki possessed considerable physical strength, able to swim easily in full Kyoshi Warrior armor and toss aside a full grown man with ease. She also seemed to have an affinity for operating vehicles, piloting a Fire Nation airship and a tundra tank without any prior experience.

Trivia
Suki was to appear in the movie The Last Airbender, but her part was cut out.
Jessica Jade Andres was given the role of Suki in M. Night Shyamalan's film adaptation, The Last Airbender. She and the Kyoshi Warriors were cut from the movie because Shyamalan believed that he was inadvertently letting the movie revolve around the warriors. In order to correct this, they were removed entirely. However, they are present in the movie novelization, manga, and video game, all of which were released before the warriors were officially cut from the film.
It was revealed that Sokka never told Suki the whole story about Yue. However, he did mention Yue to her, using the incident that happened to justify his overprotective nature.
By the end of the series, Suki remained the only human member of Team Avatar not to have gone on a "field trip" with Zuko.
Suki was originally supposed to be one of the characters who would never appear again after "The Warriors of Kyoshi", but due to her popularity among both the staff and fans, she returned for Books Two and Three, and officially became a member of Team Avatar.
The creators joked at the 2006 San Diego Comic Con that Suki once dated the foaming mouth guy, but this is not considered canon.
F. C. Yee had intended to include a scene in The Shadow of Kyoshi that linked Kyoshi's dust-stepping technique to Suki's head-running technique from "The Boiling Rock, Part 2", showing that the skill is an evolution of dust-stepping. However, the scene ended up getting cut.
Suki was one of the few people ever to escape from the Boiling Rock.
Suki's name in the Russian version of Avatar: The Last Airbender is pronounced as "su'juki" in the first two seasons and as "zuki" in the third season. This was done to avoid the original pronunciation, "suki", because it sounds the same as the Russian word "суки", which translates to a swear word. However, the original pronunciation of her name was kept in the Polish translation, despite it having the same meaning as in Russian.
Suki is the only member from the original Team Avatar not to have made an appearance nor been mentioned in The Legend of Korra outside of the first episode's opening sequence, which depicts the team in its entirety.
Suki's eye color changes throughout the series and comics. It changes from brown to green to blue at different points.
Notes
 The comic Suki, Alone claims that Kyoshi Island had closed its borders and that this isolationism applied to all of Kyoshi Island, but this is contradicted by other canon information such as the episode "The Warriors of Kyoshi", the older Avatar: The Last Airbender official website, and Avatar Extras. Thus, the isolationism as portrayed in the comic can only apply to some villages on the island, not all of them.
