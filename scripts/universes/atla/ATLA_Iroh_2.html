<html><p>Iroh was highly knowledgeable and well-versed in most styles of firebending and their respective techniques. He was also a very capable teacher of the art, having personally trained his nephew, Zuko, in the majority of his high proficiency in firebending. He also stood as one of the select few firebenders of his time who possessed the ability to generate lightning.[8] This technique required perfect calmness of mind, but unlike his brother Ozai and niece Azula, Iroh derived this from inner peace instead of amorality.

Like his brother, he could easily perform it quickly and even during intense battle. Iroh's prowess for firebending also extended to creating his own original techniques. One of the techniques he invented was the absorption and redirection of lightning. Iroh invented this by observing the fluidity of waterbending moves and their ability to effectively redirect chi.[8] He used this move on multiple occasions, to redirect natural[25] as well as man-made lightning (the latter he even channeled before it was fully unleashed).[29]

While not exclusive to him, Iroh's signature technique was his fire-breath, a feat he could perform with especially potent power that earned him the nickname "The Dragon of the West".[6][66] He was able to maintain this technique in a sweeping manner against the Dai Li to give himself and Zuko enough time to escape from their clutches.[6]

Iroh had a tendency to not involve himself in battle,[60] but when he did partake, he displayed great skill, speed, agility, and ferocity. Even in his old age and while out of shape, he overwhelmed a group of four firebending guards accompanying Admiral Zhao within seconds, causing Zhao to retreat in fear,[9] and defeated multiple trained earthbenders in combat, using the chains that had previously subdued him.[23] He was also able to overpower, with notable ease, a full squad of Imperial Firebenders accompanying Azula as well as the prodigious princess herself.[29]

His firebending skill may have developed even further after getting back in shape in prison.[37] He managed to break himself out of the jail, leaving only an enormous hole in the bars of his cell, and various scorch-marks on the walls. A shell-shocked Warden Poon described Iroh as being like a "one-man army".[40] During the coming of Sozin's Comet, Iroh displayed the true extent of his firebending prowess: he created a ring of fire around him and several other members of the Order of the White Lotus, expanding it and shrinking it with every breath, in and out. After a few breaths, he focused the ring around him into a ball, from which he launched a fire blast that breached the Inner Wall of Ba Sing Se itself.[43]

Other skills
Iroh was a talented tsungi hornist.
Iroh was a gifted strategist and tactician, having once been the Fire Nation's top general and next in line to become Fire Lord.[37] His craftiness was best showcased by his skill at Pai Sho.[60] His army won many battles in the Earth Kingdom and managed to break through the Outer Wall of Ba Sing Se.[5][22] There were many who still referred to him as "General" Iroh, despite the fact that he had been retired for years, though Zhao did so in a partially sarcastic manner.

Iroh was a lover of music; he was a good singer, as well as a gifted pipa and tsungi horn player. He had knowledge of other cultures, and history. He was also something of an amateur botanist,[2] probably due to his love of tea, although this skill was not enough to save him getting poisoned, when he confused a rare tea plant with a poisonous one.[62] Because of his love of tea, Iroh was also an excellent tea maker, increasing business in the tea shop he and Zuko worked[3] in and was eventually awarded one of his own.[34] With his adept entrepreneurial skills, Iroh had managed to invent a new variety of tea, mixing tea with milk and tapioca pearls.[44]

Iroh commicated to spirits in later life.
Iroh became very spiritual after the passing of his son. He was able to see the spirit of Aang riding Roku's dragon when no one else could.[23] He was also able to immediately discern that Princess Yue had been given life by the Moon Spirit.[9] He continued to communicate with spirits later in life. His knowledge of the spirits and their world is immense, as he was later in life able to consciously depart his soul to the Spirit World, where he was welcomed.[15]

Iroh also demonstrated an impressive physical strength and skill in close combat without the usage of firebending. While imprisoned after the fall of Ba Sing Se, he spent most of his time performing intensive calisthenic routines without the guards' knowledge. In a few weeks, his previously overweight physique had completely changed to a slim yet impressively muscular one.[37] On the Day of Black Sun, while the scorch marks on the prison walls indicated part of his escape occurred before the eclipse began, he still escaped during the eclipse, when firebending was not possible.[40] This implied that Iroh had some knowledge of hand-to-hand combat to accomplish this feat. Interestingly, Iroh had planned to escape on the Day of Black Sun beforehand, implying he knew not only of this firebending weakness but also knew when an eclipse was going to occur, despite none of this information being public knowledge.

Voice actor
Iroh was voiced by the late Japanese-American actor Mako Iwamatsu, who passed away on July 21, 2006, due to cancer. The episode "The Tales of Ba Sing Se", which aired on September 29 of that year, contained a segment titled "The Tale of Iroh" that ended with a dedication to Mako. The segment featured Iroh mourning the death of his son, Lu Ten.[2]

The role of Iroh was recast with Greg Baldwin, Mako's understudy and a long-time student of his voice. He performed a few one-off lines that Mako was unable to complete in Book Two and went on to do all of Iroh's voice work in Book Three and The Legend of Korra. Baldwin's vocal timbre is lighter than Mako's, but he replicated Mako's unique accent, pronunciation, syllable stressing, and gravelly undertones in his performance rather than using a different style.

Mako from The Legend of Korra was named after Iroh's first voice actor as a tribute.

Trivia
In the first episode, Iroh told an impatient Zuko that firebending came from the breath.[4] This corresponded with his title "The Dragon of the West", as dragons breathe fire. Iroh demonstrated the importance of breathing in "Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno", where he utilized the power of Sozin's Comet to create a blazing circle of fire around himself and the other prominent members of the Order of the White Lotus, accomplishing this only by breathing in and out.
Iroh gained the title "The Dragon of the West" for two reasons: one, due to his ability to use the "Breath of Fire" technique effortlessly, and two, from him having supposedly slain the last two dragons, Ran and Shaw.
In the Filipino, Finnish, Hungarian, Dutch, Russian, and Turkish dubs of the series, it is Iroh instead of Avatar Roku who says the words, "Previously on Avatar".
Iroh could fall asleep anywhere and anytime.[68]
Iroh developed lightning redirection by studying waterbending.
Iroh used his own redirection technique twice during the series: once when a bolt of lightning almost struck the hull of Zuko's ship,[25] and again when he grabbed Azula's hand to redirect the lightning with which she intended to strike Zuko.[29] Iroh acted like a router both times; he simultaneously took the bolt in and shot it out away from both vessels.
He is the only known individual to have successfully redirected naturally occurring lightning. Though successful, the act had several side effects that were never seen again from successful redirection; Iroh's clothes and face were singed and his hair stuck straight up.

He is the only known individual to have successfully redirected naturally occurring lightning. Though successful, the act had several side effects that were never seen again from successful redirection; Iroh's clothes and face were singed and his hair stuck straight up.
Aspects of Iroh's life and personality bear a striking resemblance to Royal Uncle Cao, one of the Eight Immortals in Chinese mythology.
Iroh is one of a few known individuals who can both generate and redirect lightning, the others being Mako, Azula, and Lightning Bolt Zolt, before he had his bending removed.
Additionally, he is the only person shown to do so in Avatar: The Last Airbender.

For the entire first book, Iroh addressed Zuko as "Prince Zuko" every time he said his name. However, in the following seasons, he usually just called him Zuko or nephew, likely due to the fact that Zuko was renounced as Prince of the Fire Nation at the start of the second season. He used the title on a few occasions afterward, usually for emphasis.
It was mentioned by Zhao that Iroh once traveled into the Spirit World and he has been shown capable of seeing spirits outside of the realm.[13] Iroh was able to see Aang and Fang as they flew over him while none of the earthbenders beside him did.[23] He was also shown to have great respect for the spirits. He warned Zhao not to go through with his plan to kill the Moon Spirit stating, "The spirits are not to be trifled with."[13] He later fought Zhao's guards when Zhao killed the Moon Spirit.[9]
Most of Iroh's past is shrouded in mystery. Usually, when information was revealed about Iroh's past, it raised more questions than answers.[69] Lu Ten's death had a large effect on Iroh, and was hinted to have been the cause of his later change in perspective.
The creators initially intended to air an episode detailing Iroh's past, although the idea was later dropped.[70]
Iroh was the first general in history to attack and successfully break through the Outer Wall of Ba Sing Se after an almost six hundred day siege. Following the death of his son, Iroh chose to withdraw, although he attributed this decision to the fact that he and his men were exhausted. Despite this accomplishment, his siege was looked upon as a failure, and used by those around him as a means of insult.
In The Last Airbender, Iroh's military conquest was briefly mentioned, but was changed to have lasted a hundred days instead of six hundred.
In The Last Airbender, Iroh's military conquest was briefly mentioned, but was changed to have lasted a hundred days instead of six hundred.
Iroh usually spoke in proverbs which, in the first and second seasons, annoyed Zuko. However, in the third book, Zuko was shown to have regretted not listening to them and consistently referred to them after joining Team Avatar.
The only known times when Iroh had ever been in the palace at the same time as his brother was during Zuko's Agni Kai against Ozai, and during the argument in the war room which caused the duel.
Additionally, his appearance before Team Avatar left with Azula to search for Ursa was his first known visit to the palace since his nephew's banishment.
Additionally, his appearance before Team Avatar left with Azula to search for Ursa was his first known visit to the palace since his nephew's banishment.
Iroh was extremely passionate about tea, and was offended when Zuko said that all tea is simply "hot leaf juice".[3] He is labeled as a "tea snob", albeit a "polite tea snob".[71]
Iroh's appearance had a striking similarity to the character Bak Mei from the film Clan of the White Lotus. This is interesting as Iroh is also a Grand Master of the Order of the White Lotus in the series.
Iroh attacked Aang only once in the series, when he and Zuko threw a fireball at Aang, Katara, and Sokka, who were flying away on Appa in "The Avatar Returns".[27]
Nickelodeon's official picture of Iroh on their website originally used his portrayal from The Boy in the Iceberg play rather than himself, though this was later corrected.
Iroh was originally intended to be just a strict teacher to Zuko with a gruff personality; however, his character eventually changed to become his uncle and with a softer side as seen in the series.[72]
Despite his mastery of the skill, Iroh was never shown to apply lightning generation in combat. He was only seen using the technique twice throughout the series: first as a demonstration,[8] and later to break down a wall while trying to escape the Dai Li.[6]
In Iroh's first appearance, he is seen playing a game similar to solitaire. The piece in his hand has the air symbol (coinciding with Aang's awakening). He places that tile over a fire one. To the right is a water tile with an earth tile on top, completing the cycle of the Avatar.
Despite his name being mentioned as early as "The Southern Air Temple", Iroh was always credited as simply "Uncle" during Avatar: The Last Airbender.
However, in The Legend of Korra, he was credited as "Uncle Iroh" in all appearances.
However, in The Legend of Korra, he was credited as "Uncle Iroh" in all appearances.
Iroh invented a tea consisting of milk and cooked balls of tapioca, similar to the modern day Boba tea.
Iroh is the first character who was voiced by two voice actors in Avatar: The Last Airbender, followed by The Duke.
After being appointed representative by his nephew, Iroh became the second known temporary ruler of the Fire Nation who was not Fire Lord; the first one was Azula as Princess Regent.
Iroh's great-grandnephew shares a name with him, and they both have been the general of an army.[73]
Iroh is one of a few known individuals to transcend into the Spirit World following death, the others being the Kemurikage[48] and the Painted Lady.[74]
A number of aspects of Iroh's character were inspired by writer Aaron Ehasz's now-deceased stepfather.[75]
