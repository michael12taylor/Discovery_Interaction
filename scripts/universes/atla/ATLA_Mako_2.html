<html><p>Mako is similar to Katara in that both have mothers killed by firebenders, a memento of a parent (Mako's father's scarf and Katara's mother's necklace), both also raised their brothers as a parent would do, a personality contradictory to that of their brothers', and both were love interests of the Avatar of their time.
According to his grandmother, Mako takes after his grandfather.
Mako is the second known person to use both lightning generation and lightning redirection, the first being Iroh, and the third is Azula.
Additionally, he is the only person to do so in The Legend of Korra.
Additionally, he is the only person to do so in The Legend of Korra.
Mako has used lightning generation in the finale of each book of The Legend of Korra.
Mako is the only core member of Team Avatar who remained single at the end of the series. However, the creators revealed that he was originally written to become romantically involved with Fire Lord Izumi's daughter, though they ultimately decided against it as there were already too many characters in the fourth book.
After his breakup with Korra, Mako occupied himself by reading Jinora's books.
By 174 AG, Mako had begun styling his hair to resemble General Iroh's but later returned to his usual spiky hairstyle.
