<html><p>When Asami and Varrick had come up with a new weapon to defend the United Republic, Tenzin met up with them, Korra, Mako, and Wu at President Raiko's office. Days later, he attended a new meeting with that group, sans the inventors, to discuss the city's evacuation progress, though it was interrupted by Lin, Suyin, Zhu Li, and Bolin. When the latter informed them that Kuvira's spirit energy cannon was ready and Zhu Li added that Kuvira planned to attack the city two weeks later, Tenzin grew alarmed. With the evacuation now made mandatory, he returned to his family at Air Temple Island and asked them why they had yet to pack their luggage. When Pema informed him that she and his three eldest children wanted to stay and help out, Tenzin embraced them all and thanked them for their support. He suggested that Pema could help out Prince Wu with the evacuation, while Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo could help the other airbenders keep track of the progress of Kuvira's army from above.

Tenzin prepared the attic of the tower on the island to serve as President Raiko's base of operations. When Team Avatar approached him, Lin, and Raiko and announced that they intended to try and take out the spirit energy cannon before it reached the city, Tenzin shot down the idea, reasoning that it was an unnecessary risk, considering the evacuation of the citizens was on schedule and General Iroh was deploying his troops. Despite his reluctance, he let them take a flying bison and leave on their mission. He grew worried, however, when the team already returned the following day and was told that Kuvira's army would arrive in a couple of hours, a week ahead of schedule. Concerned about all the people still in the city, he ordered his wife to immediately find Wu and increase their efforts to evacuate the remaining citizens.

Tenzin was selected by Korra to be part of her airbender stealth team tasked with kidnapping Baatar Jr..
Together with the other airbenders, Tenzin awaited the arrival of Kuvira's army from the top of a roof that gave them a vantage point over the battlefield. Although he had been warned about Kuvira's spirit weapon being attached to an enormous mecha suit, he was still unnerved to see the actual machine. Witnessing the cannon destroying the United Forces' fleet in a matter of seconds, Tenzin and the airbenders retreated to the Future Industries factory where Varrick and Zhu Li were monitoring the manufacturing of the hummingbird mecha suits. When Korra later joined them, alerting them that Raiko had surrendered the city and his army, he agreed with her that kidnapping Baatar Jr. and forcing him to reveal the weaknesses of the mecha suit and the cannon was their best option. He was chosen by her to be part of the stealth airbender team tasked with carrying out that mission. While Jinora and Kai stood guard atop the airship transporting Baatar Jr., he, Bumi, and Korra infiltrated the vessel. They swiftly overpowered the nonbender and after binding and gagging him, Tenzin and Bumi soared off with their wingsuits, carrying the bag with Baatar Jr. between them. Back at the Future Industries factory, he stood by as Korra eventually managed to force Baatar Jr. to contact Kuvira to call off her conquest, though Tenzin had to run for his life moments later when Kuvira traced the radio signal back to their location and blew it up with her spirit energy cannon.

Together with nine other airbenders and Korra, Tenzin tried to blow Kuvira's enormous mecha suit off balance.
Tenzin managed to survive the explosion and emerged from the rubble with everyone else when Bolin lifted a large piece of concrete. He quickly assessed Kuvira's progress from atop a rooftop and alerted everyone that she was heading their way with a battalion of mecha suits. While Asami and Varrick attempted to adapt the prototypes of the hummingbird mecha suits in Asami's office to get them airborne, he and the other benders faced Kuvira and her army in an attempt to stop them or at the very least, slow them down. On Meelo's urging, Tenzin and the other airbenders equipped themselves with balloons filled with paint. Upon reaching the enormous mecha suit, they dropped the balloons on the suit's windows, momentarily obscuring its vision. Tenzin signaled Lin, Wei, and Wing on the ground to try metalbending the joints of the suit, though they soon discovered the joints were made out of platinum and thus impervious to their bending. After Wei and Wing tied the machine's legs together with metal cables and Bolin gave the signal, Tenzin and the other airbenders blasted the suit with air currents in an attempt to knock it off balance. The suit managed to stabilize itself, however, forcing him and the others to flee when Kuvira fired her spirit cannon at them. Sitting dazed on the ground, Jinora checked up on him to see if he was all right, before they all retreated to Asami's office, where a new plan was formed: the benders would relentlessly attack the mecha suit to distract Kuvira and enable the two hummingbird mecha suits to land on the enormous machine and cut a hole in it without being crushed.

Tenzin was saved by Meelo from plummeting to the ground after he was rendered unconscious by narrowly missing a beam from the spirit energy cannon.
As such, when Kuvira aimed her cannon at Korra, Tenzin, his airbending children, Bumi, Kai, Daw, and another female airbender worked together to form a tornado in their wake and swoop down on the weaponized arm of the suit, knocking it off balance and distorting its aim. While he soared away, however, he noticed that Jinora came within range of the cannon herself. At the last second, he swooped down on her, pushing her out of the beam's trajectory, though the proximity of the blast knocked them both unconscious and they plummeted down. Before they could fall on the ground, Jinora was saved by Ikki and Meelo grabbed a hold of Tenzin and positioned himself underneath his father. By airbending at the ground from his feet, Meelo managed to break both their falls and they landed safely, where Tenzin regained consciousness.

Ultimately, their diversion worked and while Korra, Mako, Bolin, Lin, and Suyin managed to infiltrate the enormous suit, Tenzin was supported by Jinora, while he and his children made their way through the streets of the city. Before they could reach a safe place, however, a wave of energy, caused by the firing of the spirit energy cannon inside Republic City's Spirit Wilds, bore down upon them and they were forced to flee inside the hall of a nearby building, where they all huddled down and Tenzin protected his children against the incoming smoke. As it cleared out, Tenzin was supported by Jinora once again and they made their way to the heart of the Spirit Wilds, where he was surprised to find a new spirit portal. Realizing Korra and Kuvira were nowhere to be found, Tenzin, Team Avatar, and their allies set out to search the area for the Avatar. When Mako reported that there was no sign of her, he quickly ordered them to keep looking, before calling for Korra himself. He was surprised to see all the spirits return a moment later and, when Korra supported Kuvira while emerging from the spirit portal, he was glad to see her again. After Kuvira was handcuffed and escorted away, Tenzin joined his friends and family in the group hug they bestowed on Korra.

Tenzin praised Korra for all that she had already accomplished in her time as the Avatar.
Tenzin later allowed Varrick and Zhu Li to host their wedding on Air Temple Island and attended the wedding ceremony, where he sat between his wife and Lin. During the dinner party, he was seated at the same table as Tonraq and Senna and the presidential couple. When Korra had distanced herself from the party, gazing out to the night skyline of Republic City, he approached her, stating that he had spoken to President Raiko, who planned to announce the following day that they would expand the city rather than rebuild downtown. He complimented her on having transformed the world more in the few years she had been an active Avatar than most of her predecessors did in their lifetimes. Tenzin was pleased to hear Korra say that she felt like she had only begun her journey and that there was more that she desired to learn and do, taking it as a sign of hope. He lovingly placed a hand on her shoulder after she reflected on the purpose of the suffering she had gone through. Their moment was interrupted by Asami, however, who stated that Varrick was looking for him. Learning that the eccentric businessman desired to borrow a wingsuit and jump off the tower, Tenzin immediately ran to find him and prevent that from happening.

Aiding Republic City's evacuees
Tenzin volunteered at the temporary evacuee camp.
In the aftermath of Kuvira's defeat, Tenzin and the rest of the Air Nation helped out at the evacuee camp that formed on the outskirts of Republic City where a multitude of evacuees had found a new, temporary home. Inside one of the tents, he listened attentively to Zhu Li, who had assumed leadership of the camp, but before he could commence his tasks for the day, he discovered Korra and Asami walking into their tent. He warmly welcomed them back, enveloping Korra in a warm hug, and expresses his hope that both women felt refreshed from their well-deserved vacation to the Spirit World. When Korra asked in return how things were in the city, Tenzin commended Zhu Li's efforts to regulate the relief efforts for the evacuees as President Raiko was being completely preoccupied with his presidential reelection campaign at the expense of the evacuees. When Kya interrupted, suggesting that Korra talk to the evacuees to boost their morale, Tenzin was immediately sold on the idea and led Korra outside. He reconsidered, however, when throngs of evacuees trouped around the Avatar, barraging her with pleas for help. He tried to guide her out of the masses, but Korra gave a rousing and inspiring speech to the crowd instead, making Tenzin proud. When they returned to the tent and Korra instantly went to Asami's side, Tenzin remarked that the two women made a good team.

Tenzin, Korra, and the airbenders flew through the spirit portal on Oogi, entering the Spirit World. The party was surprised to find the Spirit World gray and withering. Tenzin took the opportunity to comfort Korra, knowing how special this part of the world was to her, and congratulated her on her new relationship with Asami. As spirit vines rose from the ground and began attacking the group, Tenzin and Ryu held them off with airbending before managing to fly out of the Spirit World on Oogi. Once they reached the other side, they found the United Forces stationed at the portal. Although General Iroh told Tenzin and Korra he was there on the president's orders and that he wanted to keep the peace, Tenzin asked him to retreat and let the Air Nation keep watch over the portal, though his request was denied.

The group returned to the evacuee camp, where Tenzin unsuccessfully petitioned Raiko to withdraw from the portal. Disappointed with Raiko's leadership, Asami asked Tenzin to consider running for president in the upcoming election. He declined re-entering United Republic politics but suggested that Zhu Li would make an capable president before turning his attention bacl to the needs of the hungry evacuees.

At Air Temple Island, Tenzin discussed the situation with his family, agreeing with his daughters that Raiko's actions were unjust and announcing that Zhu Li had decided to run for president. When Meelo suggested the airbenders should march on the portal, Tenzin was inspired to lead a peace protest to put pressure on Raiko to withdraw the troops. Returning to the portal with the airbenders, Tenzin informed Iroh that they were staging a nonviolent protest and that the Air Nation would not leave until the United Forces did. Meelo soon grew bored, but Tenzin urged him and the other protesters to stand together united until the president retreated. At that moment, Raiko appeared on site, ordering the airbenders to clear off Wonyong Keum's property. Once Tenzin refused to return to Air Temple Island, Raiko sent in waterbender troops to hose the airbenders. Tenzin urged them to stand their ground without retaliation. While Iroh ordered the troops to cease attacking the non-violent airbenders, Tenzin was approached by Zhu Li and told that she and other civilians had come to support the protest.

When Tokuga later began to attack the portal, threatening to kill everyone present with poison gas, Tenzin ordered the airbenders to stand ready to bend away the toxic cloud if necessary, while he and Zhu Li helped to evacuate the area. After allowing Korra to borrow Oogi to reach the ship, Tenzin and the airbenders bent away Tokuga's gas after he released it.

Tenzin later visited the Republic City Four Elements with his family on election night, where he listened to Zhu Li's acceptance speech after she was elected as the United Republic's second president. Some months later, he witnessed a fight between Jinora and Ikki, and told them the story about his arrest as a teenager to explain conflict mediation in the style of the Air Nomads, although the children still continued to argue even after they learned the story from him.

Personality
Tenzin meditated alongside Korra and his three eldest children.
Tenzin is far more calm and stern in demeanor than his father; however, he does have a sense of humor at times. He also occasionally displays a bit of "craziness" himself, though he works hard to suppress this. He always tries to be a calm person, an attempt that is sometimes thwarted by his "crazy" children or his siblings. Similarly, his mother described him as always having had a serious personality. He finds his patience severely tested with the arrival of the impetuous Korra. In an attempt to fill his father's footsteps, he works hard to transmit the Air Nomad teachings and culture, while taking his leadership role in Republic City seriously. He does embody the Air Nomad nature of being peaceful and calm, but can sometimes be riled up when around his children or Korra due to their differing perspectives. Despite his generally calm demeanor, he can become aggressive and prone to do "whatever it takes", when his family is threatened or in any danger, exemplified by his willingness to use brute force to break through the Northern defenses surrounding the Southern spirit portal in order to save Jinora. This desperation to protect his family and nation have instilled him with a dangerous inner fury that explodes from him when his loved ones are threatened, much like his father.

Tenzin is a staunch traditionalist, and at times can come across as rather inflexible and stubborn. This also shows in his disdain for pro-bending, which he considers violent, irrelevant, and a perversion to more traditional forms of bending. However, after Korra joined the Fire Ferrets, he brushed up on the rules of the game and seemed better versed in the sport. In doing so, he became less antagonistic to it than before, and even started cheering during one match. By doing this, he shows that he is willing to show a liking in the interests of those close to him.

Tenzin also appears to be rather prideful and overbearing, as he hid his inability to enter the Spirit World from others, instead making up excuses that the people around him were preventing him from doing so. When he found out that Jinora was able to see spirits, he grew jealous of her and kept stubbornly insisting that he should be the one to bring Korra to the Spirit World as Jinora would be unable to face its dangers. Following his sister's persuasion and daughter's assurance, he eventually relented and expressed how proud he was of Jinora.

Tenzin is willing to do anything to preserve the new Air Nation, even dueling with all the Red Lotus' elemental masters. Even when he is bruised and battered by the Red Lotus' attack, he refuses to give in, showing a strong resolve to protect his loved ones and allies as well as a love for his nation.

Abilities
Airbending
Tenzin uses his great dexterity and balance along with his airbending to simultaneously dodge and attack his opponents.
As the airbender among Aang's three children during his lifetime, Tenzin has been trained extensively in all of his father's airbending knowledge and prowess. After his father's passing, he became the only airbending master in the world. Ensuring that the teachings and techniques would live on, Tenzin has since been passing on the art to his airbending children, Avatar Korra, and the people who acquired airbending abilities in 171 AG. Though a pacifist at heart, Tenzin has made his combat prowess evident during the first confrontation with the Equalists' mecha tanks, exhibiting air blasts that were powerful enough to knock his opponent backward or even lift them off the ground. Likewise, against another proficient airbender in Zaheer, Tenzin was able to effectively control the battle and gradually wear down his opponent, forcing Zaheer's allies to aid him, to which Tenzin was still able to hold his own for a short period.

Even when tied down, Tenzin is able to create a tornado powerful enough to lift himself and two additional adults into the air.
Tenzin is well-versed in all airbending techniques, including one of his own invention, a variant of Aang's air scooter technique. Tenzin conjured a "wheel" of air which not only allowed him to evade attacks, but was powerful enough to deflect the claws of the mecha tanks. He is also able to use a glider by bending the air around it. Tenzin is skilled in creating extremely powerful tornadoes that are strong enough to throw the mecha tanks in the air. He was also capable of creating an air dome of sorts to protect himself and others from any harmful gases. Tenzin was the first known individual to land a solid strike on Amon, sending him and some of his men flying away with an airbending kick, though he did have some assistance from Mako at the time. Tenzin has also displayed the ability to use airbending in order to conduct a spiritual cleansing of an area, which can restore a place's connection with the Spirit World.

Other skills
Tenzin is in excellent physical shape and has proven himself a highly nimble and evasive fighter. When the Equalists launched a sneak attack to capture him, he effortlessly dodged their initial assault with no wasted movement. Even when his hands were bound, he was able to calmly dodge all of a chi blocker's close-range attacks. He also has excellent stamina, going for a ten-mile hike without tiring, and while defending the Northern Air Temple from the Red Lotus' elemental masters, he displayed incredible physical resilience when being beaten by all four of them, sustaining severe injuries without losing consciousness.

Tenzin is also knowledgeable regarding locations in the Spirit World, such as the Fog of Lost Souls and the Tree of Time.

Trivia
Tenzin is the only child of Katara and Aang who was not named directly after an already known character that was close to his parents.
"Tenzin" (བསྟན་འཛིན) is an extremely common Tibetan name meaning "defender of the faith" or more applicably, "upholder of the teachings". This is similar to his position as the last airbending master after his father died and that he must also defend his bending art against extinction. Its popularity derives from the fact that it is the first name of the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso.
Given that Tenzin learned airbending from Avatar Aang and is Avatar Korra's, who is Aang's reincarnation, airbending teacher, he is, in a way, passing his father's teachings back to him.
Tenzin is the first airbender to be born after the Air Nomad Genocide and the first known to be born to a waterbender.
Tenzin was generally seen wearing the same attire Aang did in his adulthood, with a slight alteration on the cape. By 174 AG, however, he started wearing a wingsuit, though continued to don his cape.
During the time between his father's death and the birth of Jinora, he took his father's title as the last airbender.
Tenzin provides the narration for the opening sequence of The Legend of Korra, as Katara did in the original series.
Tenzin's habit of tugging on his beard when in thought was inspired by Michael Dante DiMartino.
