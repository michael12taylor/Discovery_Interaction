<html><p>Sokka is one of only two people, aside from the Avatars themselves, to have seen four Avatars in their lifetime, the other being Katara. He saw Roku and Kyoshi manifest themselves through Aang, knew Aang, and helped to save Avatar Korra from the Red Lotus when she was five.
Early concepts of Sokka depicted him as being thirteen years old.
After LEGO released a Sokka minifigure in one of their product sets, the company's official site stated that Sokka's boomerang came from his father, Hakoda.
Sokka and Katara were created at the same time. The creators of the show liked the idea of a sibling rivalry, inspired by the fact that the two both had sisters. They were also attracted to the idea of the sister being a bender, while the brother was not.[86]
Sokka was conceived as a thirteen-year-old, but after a suggestion from Eric Coleman, he was "aged up".[87]

Sokka had an alter-ego named "Wang Fire", which he used while hiding in the Fire Nation.
Sometime after the conclusion of the Hundred Year War, Sokka worked at a grocery store.[88]
Sokka was twice mistaken for the Avatar, the first time in the comic "Sokka the Avatar" and the second in the episode "The Earth King".
