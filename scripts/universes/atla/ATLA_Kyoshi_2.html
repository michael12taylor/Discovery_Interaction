<html><p>In the episode "The Southern Air Temple", Kyoshi was seen to the right on the painting in the Earth Kingdom's Avatar Temple. However, the statue that preceded Roku's statue in the Southern Air Temple is not Kyoshi's.
In a concept piece for the episode, however, an early depiction of Kyoshi does stand after Kuruk.
In the interview An Avatar Spring Break with Mike and Bryan, Bryan Konietzko admitted that Kyoshi's statue was not finalized during the episode's production, while the script for The Warriors of Kyoshi was at works. He compared it to the designs of Buddha statues varying in different countries, as there is a margin for interpretation.

Kyoshi also had the largest feet of any Avatar, and was the largest known Avatar in terms of physicality; when seen confronting Chin the Conqueror in "Avatar Day", and the time she faced the 46th Earth King's guards, she clearly appears several heads taller than them.
In a chibi comic, Kyoshi was portrayed as a gym teacher. This can be a reference to the meaning of her name, "teacher", and the fact that she began two different factions of warriors, training them in two different fighting styles.
Kyoshi is the first known Avatar to have had descendants. Kyoshi's only known child and daughter, Koko, succeeded her as governor of Kyoshi Island and eventually became famous in her own right, having had children named after her over three hundred years later.
Avatar Kyoshi's legacy and work as Avatar has started two groups: the Kyoshi Warriors and the Dai Li, both of which Azula made use of to conquer Ba Sing Se.
Kyoshi, Roku, Aang, and Korra are all known to have defied the leaders of their respective nations: Kyoshi, at first, refused to aid the 46th Earth King when he asked her to intervene in the peasant uprising in Ba Sing Se; Roku nearly killed Fire Lord Sozin in an attempt to put a stop to his imperialistic endeavors; Aang did not move to the Eastern Air Temple as he was instructed and instead ran away, and Korra started a civil war against Chief Unalaq.
F. C. Yee had intended to include a scene in The Shadow of Kyoshi that linked Kyoshi's dust-stepping technique to Suki's head-running technique from "The Boiling Rock, Part 2", showing that skill is an evolution of dust-stepping, but the scene ended up getting cut.
Kyoshi is the earthbender in the opening sequence of The Legend of Korra.
Kyoshi is shown as the earthbender in the opening sequence of The Legend of Korra, making her the first person to be seen in the series.
Kyoshi was the first Avatar to create a new landmass via her bending when she separated her peninsula from the mainland, creating Kyoshi Island.
Kyoshi is the only named Earth Avatar, being the only element to have only one named Avatar.
Kyoshi is one of the only five known persons to have been alive for multiple passings of Sozin's Comet, with three. The others being Aang, Bumi, and Pathik, with two, and Lao Ge, with an unclear number.
Kyoshi is rumored to have taken down a shark squid with one hand.
Kyoshi is the only known female capable of lavabending.
Known to have had romantic relationships with both men and women, Kyoshi is one of the confirmed LGBTQ+ individuals in the Avatar universe. She was also the first known LGBTQ+ Avatar, with Korra being the second.
In a 2019 interview, Michael Dante DiMartino stated that "in the back of our minds we always thought Kyoshi was probably bisexual" and eventually decided to make it canon in the Korra comics.

Kyoshi is the only known Avatar to be born to parents of different ethnicities.
Despite loathing her birth parents for their criminal activities, Kyoshi nonetheless kept their memory alive partially by using her father's theater make-up and her mother's war fans as part of her Avatar look.
Kyoshi is the only Avatar known to have had difficulty mastering her birth element.
During her time as a maid at the Avatar mansion, Kyoshi kept a gold-dye tassel, a few beads, a coin she stole from the village donation box yet felt too guilty to spend, and the clay turtle she stole from Kelsang and Jianzhu on a tiny shelf in her quarters.
Kyoshi's chainmail she wore under her robes was inspired by kusari gusoku, chainmail armor that was worn by the samurai.
Kyoshi is the same height as Kelsang and Wong.
When once asked about Kyoshi's height, F. C. Yee said that he imagines her to be at least six feet tall.

Notes
 On the golden button on the right arm guard of the Kyoshi Warriors and on the fan that the statue of Avatar Kyoshi held to her face is the word 京. On the other fan, the one on her outstretched arm is the word 士. In Japanese, 京士 is pronounced kyōshi and translated as "capital samurai". However, on the mural in her shrine, her name appeared as 虛子, a proper Japanese name which is pronounced kyoshi, a near-homophone with 京士 but with a shorter 'o' sound. 

 The comic Suki, Alone claims that isolationism was a policy that applied to all of Kyoshi Island, but this is contradicted by other canon information such as the episode "The Warriors of Kyoshi", the older Avatar: The Last Airbender official website, and Avatar Extras. Thus, the isolationism as portrayed in the comic can only apply to some villages on the island, not all of them.
