<html><p>Jinora managed to survive the explosion and emerged from the rubble with everyone else when Bolin lifted a large piece of concrete. While Asami and Varrick attempted to adapt the prototypes of the hummingbird mecha suits in Asami's office to get them airborne, she and the other benders faced Kuvira and her army in an attempt to stop them or at the very least, slow them down. On Meelo's urging, Jinora and the other airbenders equipped themselves with balloons filled with paint. Upon reaching the enormous mecha suit, they dropped the balloons on the suit's windows, momentarily obscuring its vision and enabling the earthbenders on the ground to tie down the suit's legs. As Bolin gave the signal, Jinora and the other airbenders blasted the suit with air currents in an attempt to topple it over. The suit managed to stabilize itself, however, forcing Jinora and the others to flee when Kuvira aimed her spirit cannon at them. After Jinora checked if her father was all right, they all retreated to Asami's office, where a new plan was formed: the benders would relentlessly attack the mecha suit to distract Kuvira and enable the two hummingbird mecha suits to land on the enormous machine and cut a hole in it without being crushed.

Jinora was saved by Ikki after she was rendered unconscious by narrowly missing a beam from the spirit energy cannon.
When Kuvira aimed her cannon at Korra, Jinora, her airbending family, Kai, Daw, and another female airbender worked together to form a tornado in their wake and swoop down on the weaponized arm of the suit, knocking it out of balance and distorting its aim. While she soared away, however, she came within range of the cannon herself. At the last second, she was saved by Tenzin, though the proximity of the blast knocked them both unconscious and they plummeted down. Before she could fall on the ground, Jinora was saved by Ikki, who plucked her out of the sky and landed on a nearby roof.

Ultimately, their diversion worked and while Korra, Mako, Bolin, Lin, and Suyin managed to infiltrate the enormous suit, Jinora supported her father and made their way through the streets of the city with her siblings. Before they could reach a safe place, however, a wave of energy, caused by the firing of the spirit energy cannon inside Republic City's Spirit Wilds, bore down upon them and they were forced to flee inside the hall of a nearby building, where they all huddled down and Tenzin protected his children against the incoming smoke.

After the battle for Republic City ended, Jinora hugged Korra along with everyone else.
As the smoke cleared out, Jinora supported her father once again and they made their way to the heart of the Spirit Wilds, where now a new spirit portal was located. Realizing Korra and Kuvira were nowhere to be found, Jinora, Team Avatar, and their allies set out to search the area for the Avatar. Jinora ventured into the wreckage of the enormous mecha suit, though sadly signaled Mako that there was no sign of Korra. She was surprised to see all the spirits return a moment later and, when Korra supported Kuvira while emerging from the spirit portal, she was happy to see her friend again. After Kuvira was handcuffed and escorted away, Jinora hugged Korra, along with the rest of Team Avatar.

Sitting between Ikki and Meelo, Jinora later attended the wedding between Varrick and Zhu Li at Air Temple Island.

Defending the spirits
Jinora opposed Wonyong Keum plans to build an amusement park with excursions into the Spirit World.
In the aftermath of Kuvira's defeat, Jinora led a group of airbenders in a meditation session at the new Republic City spirit portal. Their session was interrupted, however, by the appearance of Wonyong Keum and his construction workers, who threatened to call the police if they did not get off the land he had purchased. Refusing to leave, Jinora informed the businessman that the land was sacred as it belonged to the spirits. The heated discussion was interrupted by Korra and Asami's return from their vacation in the Spirit World, and Jinora informed the two of Wonyong's attempts to get them to vacate the premises. When Wonyong requested Korra to escort the airbenders off his property, Jinora informed her that the businessman's true intentions were to turn the area into an amusement park and build a road so he could drive "truckloads of tourists" into the Spirit World. The argument was interrupted by the dragon eel spirit, who asked Korra to close the portals lest she would be held accountable for the fate that befell the spirits, and Jinora smiled in support when Opal assured Korra that the airbenders were on her side and ready to help protect the portal. Jinora watched on in amusement as Korra, who had been threatened by Wonyong into leaving the premises, entered the Avatar State and intimidated the businessman into leaving himself, noting that she doubted he would return anytime soon.

While Wonyong did not return, Jinora and the other airbenders were attacked at the portal by the Triple Threat Triad some time later. Using her spiritual projection technique, Jinora contacted Team Avatar back on Air Temple Island and asked for help, as well as informed them of the presence of a young man fitting Tokuga's description. Jinora continued to fight off the Triple Threats, and the battle came to a quick end when Team Avatar and, much to her surprise, several angry spirits arrived and drove away the Triple Threats. As the chaos died down, Jinora was shocked to see Korra and Asami sharing a kiss. When Asami confirmed that she and Korra were now a couple, Jinora told them that it was wonderful, happy about their relationship.

Jinora and the other airbenders were attacked by Spirit World thorns.
Jinora, her family, and some other members of the new Air Nation accompanied Korra on her trip to negotiate with the spirits and encourage them that she was still on their side. However, as the airbenders and Korra flew into the spirit portal on Oogi's back, they realized that a massive amount of the land around the portal had been destroyed. Korra was surprised, saying that the land had not been destroyed when she had been here only briefly before on her trip with Asami. Kai questioned aloud who had been strong enough to destroy the spirits realm, and Jinora, meditating on the floor, replied that it could only have been the spirits themselves. Korra said that they had probably done it to protect themselves and as a warning.

When Ikki touched a small dead flower, the flower sprung up long stems with thorns, which began attacking the airbenders, and Jinora grabbed a glider and swooped in to save Kai. The airbenders and Korra hopped onto Oogi, and they all flew out of the portal together. However, as they left, they noticed General Iroh and the United Forces entering the grounds around the spirit portal, and setting up a metal barricade. Korra demanded the troops withdraw, to which Iroh responded that he only sought peace. Tenzin responded that if that was his desire, he should leave the portal to the Air Nation. Iroh considered the idea, then disagreed, saying he had his orders, and that if they had any issues to take it up with President Raiko.

Jinora, angered by the United Forces presence at the spirit portal, discussed the matter with her family at the dinner table.
As Jinora and her family had dinner that night, Jinora angrily remarked that the United Forces had no right to be occupying the land around the portal. While Tenzin and Pema suggested that the group wait Raiko out until he changed his mind or was voted out of office, Jinora protested saying that would involve waiting too long and that they needed to act immediately. Meelo agreed and suggested that they march on the portal, an idea Tenzin agreed with and concretized as a peace march, which Jinora enthusiastically offered to participate in.

Jinora and the rest of the Air Nation spent the next day protesting the spirit portal's occupation. After hours of protesting, Raiko and the United Forces came in as Raiko commanded waterbenders to directly hose the airbenders down. Jinora was among several of the protestors who was hit with a hose, and she stood behind Tenzin who covered her with his arms to protect her, telling the airbenders to not retaliate no matter what. Jinora coughed as the waterbenders let up, and Tenzin warned the others of what may be coming next. The barricade around the spirit portal was broken by Zhu Li, her film crew, and other protesters there to support the airbenders. The protestors all then began to chant together, demanding that the portal be left in peace and in the public's hands.

During the protest, Tokuga flew an airship across the portal, demanding that the United Forces leave, with threat of poison gas. Jinora and the other airbenders helped the civilians evacuate from the portal area. After the civilians left, Jinora and the airbenders began to bend the air around the poison gas in order to contain it so that the civilians within Republic City would be safe.

Three weeks later, Jinora attended a party for the announcement of the results of the presidential election. When Zhu Li was announced as the winner, Jinora, her family, and other members of the new Air Nation stood together as they listened to Zhu Li's acceptance speech. Some time later, Jinora and Ikki got into a fight after the latter accidentally tore a scroll. Tenzin explained the Air Nomad way of conflict mediation to his daughters by telling him a story about his own teenage years; however, this only led to more fighting over the proper way to "cleanse the air" among the children.

Personality
A calm yet carefree girl, Jinora has a natural connection to the Spirit World.
Jinora is a quietly reserved, intelligent, studious girl, much different from her younger, more rambunctious siblings. Out of Tenzin and Pema's four children, she is the calmest and most mature. However, she does like to tease her siblings from time to time, causing Ikki to perceive her as "mean and bossy".

Although still young, Jinora displays a great amount of courage, as she was willing to exchange her soul in favor of the world's well-being when she was being used as leverage to coerce Korra into opening the Northern spirit portal, as well as prolong the separation of her soul and body in order to aid the world by finding Raava. Despite her usually calm demeanor, Jinora has shown an assertive side to her when standing up for herself and her beliefs. She argued with Tenzin when he stated that she was too young and inexperienced to receive her airbending tattoos, and also refused to leave the Republic City spirit portal after Wonyong Keum planned to exploit it.

Abilities
Airbending
Jinora is able to create an enormous tornado, which other airbenders later helped to maintain.
Jinora is an airbending master who has displayed an excellent variety of skills. This was evident when Korra earthbent Jinora and Ikki into the air and she used airbending to glide down, and later when she helped fend off Equalists when Air Temple Island came under attack. She is also proficient in the use of a glider, able to fly at a rapid pace and carrying someone along with her, be it on her back or held by her legs, and has mastered the air scooter, a move invented by her late paternal grandfather, Aang. Her skills in combat and natural agility allow her to go toe-to-toe with even the most agile of Equalist chi blockers. Her airbending abilities also supplement her fighting skills by giving her the element of surprise so that she may gain the first strike, as well as enhanced mobility. She is able to create a powerful air blast, whirlwind, and air swipe. Her overall proficiency and knowledge of the airbending skills and teachings have ultimately made her father give her the blue arrow tattoos, the symbol of a true master.

Spiritual projection
Jinora used her spiritual projection technique to call for Korra's help when she was attacked by the spirit vines.
Jinora can also combine her airbending with her spiritual powers to project her spirit out of her body, enabling her to phase through objects and travel to another location in a matter of seconds. By locking on to people's energy, she can use this technique to track people down or call for help when she is in a dire situation. To utilize the technique and maintain the projection, Jinora must be able to focus, which requires a peaceful and quiet environment.

Other skills
Much like her grandfather Aang, Jinora possesses a strong natural affinity with spirits and spiritual-related matters. She is able to see spirits that hide their presence from others, detach her spirit from her body to move about freely in the material world, and guide people into the Spirit World. Similarly, she can sense the energy presence of other individuals and track them through it over great distances, as well as that of a place.

Being well-read, Jinora has a great general knowledge, ranging from historic facts to the workings of recent technology and the habits of fauna.

Trivia
The attire Jinora wore in Books One through Three is similar to the common clothing of young airbenders, which Aang wore in Books One and Two of Avatar: The Last Airbender.
Jinorasa was the name of a lesser-known Buddhist writer and poet. Coincidentally, Jinora is also a well-read girl, having encyclopedic knowledge on various subjects, such as being able to identify a fire ferret on the spot and recite its natural habitat.
Jinora and her siblings never met their grandfather, Aang.
Jinora is the first female airbender to be born after the Air Nomad Genocide and the first airbender known to have a nonbender parent.
Unlike her parents and siblings, Jinora has brown eyes.
Like her father, Jinora is more serious and mellow, whereas Ikki and Meelo are more hyper and playful.
Jinora has a close relationship with her aunt, Kya.
Jinora is the first female airbending master in 171 years and the second airbending master since the Air Nomad Genocide.
Jinora is the only known person able to perform the spiritual projection technique.
Jinora has been responsible for saving the Avatar Spirit on two separate occasions: the first being when she helped Korra find Raava during Harmonic Convergence and the second being when she led the members of the Air Nation in creating a large tornado with the intention of stopping Zaheer from killing Korra in the Avatar State.
