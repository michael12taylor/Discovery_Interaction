<html><p>Bolin can be gullible at times and was taken advantage of by Desna and Eska due to his affection for the latter. He was grateful to Korra for starting a war just to get away from Eska, but his joy immediately turned into fear upon seeing Eska coming for him in a fit of rage.[33]

Abilities
Earthbending
Bolin perfected his earthbending abilities competing in pro-bending matches.
As the earthbender for an official pro-bending team, Bolin has become highly skilled in the art of earthbending. Bolin describes his earthbending style as "light on his feet", being more agile and less reliant to being rooted to the ground as opposed to conventional earthbending. Despite this, Bolin also employs traditional earthbending outside of matches, lifting boulders and summoning earth walls, as well as employing brute strength to help the Beifong sisters topple a building, albeit with noticeable strain.[54] He can also hold his own against multiple opponents, as evidenced when he took down three waterbenders in tandem, using the small discs available in the Pro-bending Arena.[35]

Bolin also possesses a sharp aim, being able to direct an earth disc at the exact angle to make it ricochet off a guard rail and squarely strike an opposing player. His fine control and aim is of such skill that he can bend a tiny pebble and strike P'Li's third eye[44] or fire small chunks of earth in rapid succession to take down a speeding motorcycle.

Lavabending
Bolin created a large stream of lava with ease.
Although Bolin discovered by accident that he had the rare ability to bend lava, he was able from the start to quickly stop an oncoming flow of the heated substance.[48] Shortly afterward, despite being an amateur, Bolin proved himself able to phase change the earth between both states and manipulate it in battle. During his second fight with Ghazan, Bolin was able to hold his own using this skill against the more experienced lavabender. At first, he used a range of pro-bending tactics in his combat against Ghazan. As the battle continued, he used more traditional earthbending tactics, incorporating them into his lavabending.[49] By 174 AG, his proficiency in lavabending had improved to the point that he could create larger streams of lava that stretched much further[9] and even use it while being handcuffed. He also demonstrated the ability to lavabend with his feet and is able to turn lava back into earth much quicker and with less effort, while also being able to create large waves of molten rock.[52] Bolin can also manipulate and maintain lava in a disc shape and rotated it at high speeds to cut through metal.[55]

Other skills
Bolin is agile, as he was able to dodge the Dai Li's attack in attempt to escape the Earth Queen's Temple, and also has some skill in wrestling and grappling, which he utilized during his one-on-one tiebreaker match with an experienced Black Quarry Boar-q-pine earthbending opponent. He also has a degree of resilience to pain, as during his semifinal pro-bending match, he was able to continue fighting despite being hit in his right shoulder by an earth disk. Bolin has also proven himself to be a good swimmer, capable of holding his breath for a significant period of time while simultaneously dodging Ghazan's lavabending attacks.

Bolin has a strong business sense, as has been noted by both Asami and Varrick, and is a talented and charismatic public speaker, able to draw huge positive reactions from crowds. Varrick decided to exploit this ability by casting Bolin as the star of his propaganda films, making him the poster boy of the Southern rebellion.

Bolin was able to figure out how to pilot an airship, albeit with some difficulty,[47] and has a close relationship with his pet fire ferret, Pabu, to whom he could give various commands.[23]

Trivia
Bolin's appearance was inspired by the early ideas of Toph, who was originally going to be male.[64][65]
According to Mako, Bolin apparently has a habit of bringing "crazy fangirls" to the Fire Ferrets' changing room.
Korra noted that his "light on your feet" style of earthbending is more useful than the traditional style.
Bolin is similar to Sokka, as they both:
Serve as comic relief from time to time.
Have a sibling who dated the Avatar.
Lost their mother to a firebender.
Came up with the name of their respective Team Avatar.
Have worn fake facial hair to disguise their appearance.
Had a romantic relationship with a Northern Water Tribe princess, as well as with a four lettered named, nonbender born, Earth Kingdom citizen.

Narook's Seaweed Noodlery and Central City Station are some of the places Bolin usually hangs out.[16][22]
Bolin is particularly bad at lying.[26]
Bolin's hairstyle resembles a "ducktail", a popular American hairstyle in the 1950s. "Greasers" often had their hair styled in a ducktail.
Bolin learned a street variation of Pai Sho from Shady Shin.[45]
Along with Ghazan, Bolin is the only other known non-Avatar earthbender with the ability to lavabend.
With the death of Ghazan, Bolin is the only known living lavabender.
Michael Dante DiMartino considers Bolin especially fun to write for, particularly "knowing PJ Byrne is going to add his own hilarious take on whatever [they] give him".[66]
Bolin's leather jacket outfit in Book Four: Balance was inspired by that of the comic book character Rocketeer, created by Dave Stevens, though it was given a sleeker appearance in the line of a design of Sarah Trost, because the original jacket had too many buttons, which is a burden for animators and would have led to too many retakes.[67]
