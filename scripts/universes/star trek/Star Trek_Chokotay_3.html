<html><p>After Ransom had a change of heart and surrendered to Voyager, Janeway returned to her senses. In a silent moment, she told Chakotay that he may have had good reason to stage a little mutiny of his own. Chakotay admitted that the thought had occurred to him, but that it would have been "crossing the line." This struck a chord with the captain who realized how close her recent actions had come to being no better than that of the Equinox and Captain Ransom. (VOY: "Equinox, Part II")

Chakotay desperately trying to revive Janeway after their shuttle crashes
Even though Chakotay considered Janeway to be one of his closest friends, he also found her to be sometimes an unreasonable person who did not know when to step back. During another incident three years earlier involving the Borg and Janeway's decision to strike a deal with them in exchange for safe passage through their space, Chakotay told her point blank that what she was proposing was foolish and too great a risk. Using the parable of the scorpion, he tried to explain to her that the mission she was planning to embark on was doomed to fail as the Borg were not the kind one could strike equitable deals with. He also believed Janeway's decision to be selfish as she was willing to supply the Borg with means to assimilate yet another species just so she and her crew could get home faster. When Janeway asked him to trust her he remained steadfast with his belief, accusing her of being blinded by her desire to go back home no matter the cost. After a lot of arguing that was not going anywhere, however, both realized that in order for the mission to be successful, they had to set their differences in opinion aside and work together. Chakotay's objections ended up inspiring a backup plan between the two, in case the Borg turned on them; this ended up saving the crew. (VOY: "Scorpion", "Scorpion, Part II")

According to Captain Janeway's mimetic duplicate, Chakotay was a "friend who wasn't afraid to let me know when I am wrong." Their working relationship was perhaps summed up informally by Janeway from an alternative future who, visiting the grave of Chakotay in her timeline, said, "Any final words of advice for your old captain? Wait, don't tell me. I'm being impulsive. I haven't considered all the consequences. It's too risky. Thanks for the input, but I've got to do what I think is right". From Chakotay's perspective, he came to recognised that it was his duty to advise Janeway but that she would always make the final decision. (VOY: "Course: Oblivion", "Shattered", "Endgame")

Chakotay's relationship with Kathryn Janeway wasn't always controversial. Early during their voyage home, he shared with her some of his spiritual rituals, such as how to embark on a vision quest and talk to her "animal guide". He also showed and shared with her his private medicine bundle. They often had weekly dinners together and once went on a moonlight sail on Lake George. He was also the first person she confided the end of her relationship with her former fiancé Mark Johnson to, who in 2374 revealed in a letter that after believing her lost, he moved on and married another woman. They remained great friends throughout and she even lent Chakotay a copy of Dante's Inferno given to her by Mark, which she'd never lent to anyone. They were supportive of each other and Chakotay was happy to see her have some fun when she in 2376 had developed an interest in one of the characters of the Fair Haven program created by Tom Paris, encouraging her he enjoy it when she was embarrassed about having feelings towards a hologram. (VOY: "Fair Haven") When a Janeway from a passed timeline, evidently struck by him, asked him about the closeness of their relationship in the future, he simply replied that there were some barriers they never crossed. (VOY: "The Cloud", "Coda", "Hunters", "Shattered")

Her love for Chakotay was one of the reasons Admiral Janeway risked time traveling back to Voyager and sacrificed herself to help the ship get home quicker. She desperately wanted to avoid Seven of Nine's death, which happened during that Janeway's 23 year journey home, and the trauma it caused to Chakotay, who was married to Seven by that point. (VOY: "Endgame")

B'Elanna Torres
Chakotay tries to get Torres to tell him why she's been "trying to hurt herself"
B'Elanna Torres was Chakotay's engineer, and unofficial first officer aboard the Val Jean, and the two shared a close friendship as well as working relationship for years. Despite their occasional differences, Chakotay was the one she trusted the most and probably also the only who truly understood her nature and inner struggle; she often returned to him for guidance. 

With a fiery temper mostly from her Klingon side, Torres was the first to speak up that it wasn't Captain Janeway's right to destroy the Caretaker's array and thus get them all stranded in the Delta Quadrant. Speaking as her commanding officer, however, Chakotay made it clear who the captain was. From then on, Chakotay asked his entire crew to respect Janeway as their leader and embrace the Starfleet way. Initially, the most hesitant and resistant person to do this was Torres. (VOY: "Caretaker")

Voyager's violent hurtle into the Delta Quadrant cost them the lives of many of their crew members, leaving key positions open that needed to be filled urgently. One of those positions was that of chief engineer which Chakotay championed for Torres to get, even though Joe Carey was next in line. Chakotay, knowing that Torres was the better engineer, insisted that Janeway consider her for the position. Although Janeway thought it was a long shot, as she saw Torres as brash and incapable of exhibiting the kind of professionalism required from a command officer, he continued standing up for her, insisting that if she only gave her a chance, Torres wouldn't disappoint her. He also told Torres that she would have to start treating people better if she wanted to get ahead on the ship and make it. Even though Torres put up a fight, she was thankful that Chakotay still believed in her; after proving herself to Janeway, she got the job. (VOY: "Parallax")

Torres didn't instantly become a model Starfleet officer though, and it took her some time and a few lessons to turn her life around and fully embrace the Starfleet crew. (VOY: "Prime Factors") Whenever she needed someone to turn to when she was going through a rough patch in her life over, she'd go to Chakotay. They often relied on each other when they needed their emotional compass checked and when they needed to put things into perspective, but Chakotay was never hesitant to tell her like it is when she behaved stubbornly or out of line. He also never played favorites with her due to the past they shared, even though it was sometimes difficult for him to separate the strong friendship they had shared over the years from his standpoint as the first officer. (VOY: "Twisted", "Maneuvers", "Barge of the Dead")

In Torres vision: "I'm the Chakotay you want me to be"
As friends, they did spend time together engaging in various activities; the two occasionally played hoverball together on the holodeck, though he wasn't very good. On one occasion, she was beating him 19 to 7, but he claimed he was just lulling her into a false sense of security. Chakotay had also helped her find her animal guide and he prayed with her when they both believed they were going to die. Even though they had always shared a friendship and never crossed the line into romance, Torres felt a hidden attraction toward Chakotay. This was revealed when the Botha manipulated the crew and induced disturbing hallucinations in them and Torres was carried away by a passionate hallucination involving Chakotay. She never acted on her feelings for him, however, and was able to move on. (VOY: "The Cloud", "Twisted", "Persistence of Vision", "Maneuvers")

When Chakotay once left Voyager – without authorization – in order to pursue Seska, it was Torres who pleaded with a rather upset Captain Janeway to try to understand Chakotay's struggle and the humiliation he faced after Seska's betrayal, asking her not to lose faith in him as her first officer. Janeway remarked that Chakotay was quite lucky to have someone care about him as much as Torres did. 

Around 2374, Chakotay received word from one of his Maquis friends back home that the insurrection was over and that the Maquis had all been wiped out by the Cardassians and their ally from the Gamma Quadrant. The news both saddened and angered Torres, who realized that everything she had known and fought for back home was gone. Through the course of the year, she regularly went to the holodeck and played the most dangerous programs she could find with the safety protocols off line. This eventually impaired her ability to work, and although Janeway confined her to her quarters and took away her holodeck privileges, Chakotay took the time to find out what was really bothering her. He even took her down to the holodeck, leading her to believe they'd play a simple program – and instead, he forced her into a program where she was re-enacting the massacre of the Maquis. He forced her to face her inner demons and come to terms with the fact that they both wished they could have been there to help their friends fight the good fight, but that because they hadn't been there, it didn't mean that they did not deserve to live and move on with their own lives. (VOY: "Hunters", "Extreme Risk")

When in 2377 Torres found out she was pregnant, he came up to her and jokingly asked, "Have you checked the warp core for radiation leaks today? ... You have a certain glow about you." She immediately knew someone had told him. Chakotay would have liked to be the child's godfather, and even suggested several names – such as Taya, the feminine form of Chakotay – but recognised, perhaps more than others, that parental advice and suggestions from others could become irritating to the parents and knew when to step back, which Torres appreciated in him. In the end, Torres decided not to choose Chakotay to be the godfather, in part because she believed he didn't really know about raising children. (VOY: "Lineage")

The mimetic duplicate of Chakotay walked Torres down the aisle and gave her away to Tom Paris during their wedding aboard the duplicate Voyager in 2375. (VOY: "Course: Oblivion")

Tom Paris
Chakotay knew Tom Paris from a time when Paris had joined the Maquis after his disgraceful discharge from Starfleet. He didn't like Paris because unlike himself who had joined the Maquis on moral grounds, he saw in Paris nothing more than a mercenary, willing to fight for anyone willing to pay his bar bills. Needless to say, he was not too happy to see him on Captain Janeway's bridge after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant. 

They eventually came face to face, after the Caretaker had released them to their ships, and Chakotay was forced to cooperate with Janeway. Although Chakotay was particularly angry at Paris, possibly added to by the fact he'd just found out that Tuvok was a spy, Janeway asked Chakotay to grant Paris the same respect he expected her to show his crew. The two were able to come to terms enough to go down to the planet together, and when Chakotay broke his leg trying to escape, Paris went back to save him. When Chakotay told him to leave, Paris snarked that if he saved Chakotay's life, it would belong to him. The two eventually made it out safely, and Chakotay joked to the captain when they returned that his life belonged to Paris and volunteered to be his "personal bodyguard," against possible hostility from the former Maquis crew. (VOY: "Caretaker")

In 2372, Paris pretended to harbor animosity towards an unknowing Chakotay in order to expose a traitor on board Voyager. During this time, he regularly showed up late to his duty shift, set up a gambling operation which Chakotay broke up and he eventually pushed Chakotay to the floor of the bridge when called on his unacceptable behavior. He also loudly expressed his negative opinion on Chakotay's role as first officer in Voyager's mess hall to many crewmembers. The two later set aside their differences when Chakotay finally found out about Paris' true intentions, and in an interview with Neelix, Paris particularly apologized for giving Chakotay such a hard time as part of his role. From that point onward, they buried their hatchet for the last time and finally got over their past animosities and hard feelings for one another. (VOY: "Meld", "Lifesigns", "Investigations") Chakotay, for his part, frequently addressed Paris by his first name, suggesting a certain level of affection, and by their seventh year together appreciated Paris', saying "we love having him around". (VOY: "Shattered")

Tuvok
Chakotay and Tuvok served together on the Val Jean, where Tuvok was posing as an undercover agent for Starfleet in order to infiltrate Chakotay's cell. After they had been stranded in the Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker's array, Tuvok's real identity was soon revealed. This angered Chakotay who felt fooled and betrayed by Tuvok. However, as the nature of their situation required, they maintained a cordial relationship when they were forced to cooperate and work together aboard Voyager. (VOY: "Caretaker")

When Captain Janeway picked Chakotay as her first officer over Tuvok, Tuvok was disappointed but respected her decision. Tensions between the two still occasionally arose, especially when Tuvok kept reciting Starfleet protocols and procedures to Chakotay who sometimes had his own way of doing things. When B'Elanna Torres had punched Lieutenant Carey in the nose, and this accident landed him (Carey) in sickbay, Tuvok insisted on having her put in the brig, pointing out that striking a fellow officer was considered a court martial offense. Chakotay, understanding Torres' ways and that she could succeed if given a chance, asked Tuvok to drop the matter as he would discipline her in another manner. (VOY: "Parallax") 

They also occasionally disagreed over command decisions such as the time when Voyager encountered an inversion field which had twisted and distorted the ship's hull. Tuvok suggested accessing the navigational array and from there engaging thrusters. Chakotay, however, decided to follow Torres' suggestion. This lead Tuvok to second-guess Chakotay's decision, which in turn irritated Chakotay who reminded him that he was in command. When it turned out that Tuvok's suggestion would indeed have been the wiser choice, Chakotay admitted that while he sometimes found Tuvok arrogant and irritating, he nonetheless believed him to be "one hell of an officer". Tuvok responded that while he in fact hadn't always been particularly partial to his methods either, he had always respected Captain Janeway's decisions, even though her decision to make Chakotay first officer put him in a position he was unaccustomed to. Tuvok apologized if that had ever caused him to make things more difficult for Chakotay, an apology Chakotay graciously accepted. (VOY: "Twisted") 

Throughout their journey back home, their relationship gradually softened and both came to greatly appreciate and respect the other. On one occasion, when a former Maquis crew member directly disobeyed Tuvok's orders, Chakotay even went so far as to personally set him straight, making sure he understood whose orders he needed to respect on the ship and that disobedience of those the Maquis did not personally approve of would have its consequences. (VOY: "Learning Curve")

When Voyager was traversing what they dubbed "the Void" in 2375, Janeway fell into a deep, guilt-based depression over the ship being trapped in the Delta Quadrant due to her decisions. Worried, Chakotay relied on Tuvok's knowledge of her past and her psyche to predict that she would likely resort to self-sacrifice to protect the crew. When asked by Chakotay, Tuvok pledged his support in preventing any such outcome. (VOY: "Night")

Romance
Seska
Chakotay and Seska share a moment
Seska and Chakotay were not only together in the Maquis, but they were also romantically involved sometime in the past, although they had eventually decided not to pursue their relationship any further. A certain attraction between them still existed, however, and when Chakotay once reminded Seska of their decision to not be together anymore, she laughed it off, joking that stranded in the Delta Quadrant, he didn't have all that many options. 

Despite being hesitant to pursue a romantic relationship with her, Chakotay nonetheless remained very protective of Seska and when she was accused of sabotage and collaboration with the Kazon, he was the only one on her side until, much to his disappointment, evidence proved that she was indeed betraying them. She not only had collaborated with the Kazon, but it turned out that she was in fact a Cardassian spy who had her physique surgically altered to look Bajoran in order to infiltrate Chakotay's Maquis cell. She insisted, however, that she had only one agenda with Chakotay which wasn't all that secret. 

Shortly after she was exposed and before her departure from Voyager, she expressed her deep disappointment in Chakotay who had decided to take on "mighty Starfleet principles", which she believed to be responsible for their perilous situation. She wondered how she could ever have loved him. (VOY: "State of Flux") 

After this betrayal by Seska, Chakotay felt a great sense of shame and disappointment, because she had not only taken advantage of his trust and care for her, but also because after everything he had done for her, she publicly humiliated him by turning out to have been a Cardassian spy who now had, once again, turned her back on him by defecting to the enemy. 

After Seska fled Voyager, she joined Maje Culluh of the Kazon-Nistrim, constantly plotting new ways to capture Voyager. In one instance, she lured Chakotay into a trap in which he was caught and tortured by Culluh and his men unsuccessfully for information about Voyager. She used that opportunity to artificially inseminate herself and eventually gave birth to a baby boy she claimed to be Chakotay's son. 

Unable to abandon his child, Chakotay – as soon as he found out – pursued her. It turned out to be a trap once again, and Chakotay's pursuit lead to the capture of the Voyager by the Nistrim and to the crew being marooned on a desolate planet. 

The Doctor, who had stayed aboard Voyager when the Nistrim took over, examined the child and much to Seska's surprise revealed that the baby was half Kazon and thus not Chakotay's son. 

A rescue attempt lead by Tom Paris lead to the Nistrim being forced to abandon Voyager. it was during Paris' rescue attempt when Seska received a high dose of electric charge at one of the consoles and shortly after died with her baby in arm. Culluh took the baby with him when leaving Voyager, leaving her remains behind – which Chakotay later found when retaking the ship. (VOY: "Maneuvers", "Basics, Part II")

In 2371, Seska had found Tuvok's Insurrection Alpha holonovel training program depicting a Maquis mutiny and reprogrammed it with the goal of trapping Tuvok and anyone with him inside the program the next time he tried editing the narrative parameters file, and with the safety protocols turned off. The novel portrayed a holo Chakotay programmed to be strongly enamored by Seska, and the two were enthusiastically living out their old wild Maquis ways. (VOY: "Worst Case Scenario")

Kellin
Chakotay and Kellin's brief love affair
Kellin, a Ramuran, who came from a closed society, fell in love with Chakotay on one of her missions to retrieve and bring back someone who had decided to leave their society. The Ramuran's biology was such that those whom they met couldn't hold their memories of contact with the Ramurans for more than a few hours. Similarly, Ramurans who escaped also had their memories of the new species they encountered wiped out. Kellin explained that she had visited Voyager previously and that she and Chakotay had fallen in love. Chakotay was taken aback by the things Kellin said and it took him a while to fall in love with her again. 

Shortly after Kellin's return, the Ramurans pursued her and an agent beamed aboard to take her back; he hit her with a neurolytic emitter and wiped out her knowledge of Chakotay. Chakotay tried hard to get her to remember him and what they felt for each other, but with Kellin's memory of Chakotay and their feelings for one another wiped out, Kellin just wanted to return to her world and was not interested in pursuing a romance with Chakotay. As she left, Chakotay – knowing that he would soon forget about her and that all electronic records would be wiped clean as well by the Ramurans, began hand writing down his memories of her visit, so they wouldn't be forgotten. (VOY: "Unforgettable")

Valerie Archer
Chakotay and Archer meet in Species 8472's recreation of the Quantum Café
Valerie Archer and Chakotay (calling himself Jason Hayek) met while Chakotay was on a reconnaissance away mission investigating a recreation of Starfleet Command and Starfleet Academy constructed on a space station in the Delta Quadrant. At first unbeknowns to Chakotay, Archer was one of Species 8472, genetically modified to look Human. Chakotay's initial interactions with Archer, while flirtatious, were solely for the purposes of finding out information, while Archer's were for the purpose of practising acting like a human (Species 8472 were running the recreation as a training facility to prepare traineers to infiltrate Starfleet on reconnaissance missions). When they met a second time, for a date suggested by Archer, both were using the interaction for espionage (Archer had been informed by her superior that Chakotay might be a Human and had been charged with investigating him). However, by the end of the date, when Archer initiated a kiss (ostensibly as part of her training to learn more about the Human species), Chakotay, initially resistant, kissed Archer passionately. The kiss was a ploy by Archer to get a genetic sample from Chakotay to test what species he was. Having informed her superior that his suspicions were correct, Chakotay was caught before he managed to leave the space station. During interrogation and a procedure to extract more of Chakotay's DNA to improve Species 8472's genetically engineered disguises, Chakotay managed to further engage Archer on an intellectual and empathetic level. While their relationship had initially been based on suspicion and utility, a genuine romantic and respectful connection developed between the two during their times together. Their evident mutual respect and trust was persuasive to their superiors during the subsequent diplomatic engagment between Voyager and Species 8472 to try to avoid conflict. When the two sides had reached an agreement, Chakotay and Archer met again and expressed their appreciation for each other, indicating how they would have liked to be able to spend more time with each other. Archer said it was a shame their two species were so different, otherwise she would have asked him for a second date. Chakotay said Archer had made a "terrific human" and that he would like Archer to give him a tour of her relm (i.e., fluidic space) in the future; Archer replied that she would like that. Before they parted, Archer initiated another kiss, which they both enjoyed. (VOY: "In the Flesh")

Seven of Nine
Seven of Nine and Chakotay got off to a rough start; he initially saw in her a mere drone that was not to be trusted. He made it clear to Captain Janeway that he did not think it was a good idea to take her along on their journey, stating that trying to bring her back to Humanity might be impossible as her Borg part might always cause complications and haunt her. He also disliked Seven's adversarial and insubordinate attitude toward Captain Janeway in particular and ship regulations in general and he once voiced his concern of allowing her to be the sole person in charge of Voyager when it was passing through a dangerous Mutara class nebula. (VOY: "Scorpion", "Prey", "One") 

As their journey progressed and as the crew began slowly warming up to her, Chakotay also began seeing in Seven a valuable crew member. His impression of her changed and he no longer believed that she could not make it as Human. He told Captain Janeway once that when she first came aboard, he did not think that she would last a day, much less a year. He was glad that Janeway had proven him wrong in that regard. (VOY: "Infinite Regress") 

On one occasion he encouraged her to take on three former child drones from her former collective by having their neural implants removed so they could live as individuals. (VOY: "Survival Instinct") When in 2376 she asked to be relieved as the children's guardian – mainly because she couldn't get them to obey her rather rigid schedule that allotted specific times for "fun" – Chakotay denied her request, stating that she treated the children as if they were still on a Borg cube, making them do the same things at the same times and not allowing them to express their individuality. He encouraged her to grant them some leeway and spontaneity so they could develop as individuals. (VOY: "Ashes to Ashes")

Seven breaks up with Chakotay
In 2378, while trying to explore different aspects of her Humanity such as social activities and intimate relations, Seven began playing with the possibility of a romantic relationship with Chakotay. She simulated a few dates with her new love interest on the holodeck. (VOY: "Human Error")

When Seven's cortical node shut down during the simulations she was running, mainly because of a certain level of emotional stimulation she had experienced, she decided to terminate her experimentation with dating and the strong emotions that followed it. It turned out that the shutting down of her cortical node was a fail-safe mechanism to deactivate drones who started to regain their emotions. Even though The Doctor offered to help her to function normally again through several operations, Seven refused, stating that all those holographic fantasies were an inefficient use of her time. She was also quite embarrassed that The Doctor had found out about her fantasies with Chakotay but knew that he would keep that information confidential. (VOY: "Human Error")

Chakotay and Seven kiss.
Chakotay doesn't want to let Seven go just yet
However, The Doctor did not give up and several months later was able to devise a safe method of removing her implants in one surgical procedure. This gave Seven the freedom to experience emotions without the feared repercussions and she finally began pursuing a relationship with Chakotay. On one date, she prepared a picnic in cargo bay 2 for them, complete with wine, which the Chakotay described as "perfection." Later, they had a private dinner in Chakotay's quarters. Seven transported in, saying she didn't think it would be seen as appropriate carrying flowers to the first officer's quarters. To avoid the uncomfortable anticipation of the first kiss, Seven figured it would be best if she got it over with and kissed him. When Chakotay asked about the second kiss, she replied she'd have to check her research – but the two continued passionately, until being called to the bridge moments later. (VOY: "Endgame")

In an alternate timeline, Admiral Janeway revealed to her that Chakotay and Seven got married in that timeline, and that she died while he remained heartbroken. Upon hearing this, Seven tried to break off the relationship with Chakotay in order to save both of them from a lot of heartache, but Chakotay refused to let her end it based on what he believed to be mere speculation and they decided to continue their romance despite what they had heard. (VOY: "Endgame")

Alternate Chakotays
Biomimetic duplicate
In 2374, the Voyager, while dangerously low on deuterium as fuel, landed on a Demon Class planet rich in deuterium sources. The planet was filled with silver fluid with mimetic properties. The Silver Blood sampled the crew's DNA and created duplicates with identical memories and personalities but with the ability to survive on the planet. The silver blood would not let Voyager leave unless it could duplicate the rest of Voyager's crew to populate the planet. Captain Janeway, understanding that this was their only way out, allowed the "silver blood" to duplicate the crew. In 2375, this duplicate ship – unaware that it was a facsimile of the original Voyager crew – began suddenly dying one by one due to warp drive radiation. Upon finding out their true identities, "Chakotay" argued with "Janeway", who wanted to carry on towards Earth, that they should return to their real home, the Demon class planet, or the entire crew would die. "Janeway" refused but was convinced when "Chakotay" died from the raditaion. In her impromptu eulogy informing the crew of his death, "Janeway" called "Chakotay" a "friend who wasn't afraid to let me know when I am wrong". Unfortunately, everyone died before the ship could reach home. (VOY: "Demon", "Course: Oblivion")

Holographic recreations
The Bajoran "Katanay", from Photons Be Free
Chakotay was holographically duplicated on a number of occasions:

Recreations of crew members from Voyager and the Jupiter Station Holoprogramming Center were seen by The Doctor during a holographic malfunction in 2371. This simulation, or daydream, included Chakotay. (VOY: "Projections")
The entire crew of Voyager was recreated by Tuvok from his Insurrection Alpha program, including Chakotay, who was depicted as the leader of the Maquis mutiny. (VOY: "Worst Case Scenario")
The Kyrian Museum of Heritage in the 31st century used the program The Voyager Encounter to detail their encounter with the warship Voyager as an aid to a history lesson. In that recreation, Chakotay (whose name in the simulation was pronounced differently) was depicted as a cold-blooded killer working for an equally cold-blooded captain, who had ordered the genocide of millions of people. His tattoo was shown to be a lot bigger, covering half his face. (VOY: "Living Witness")
In 2374, The Doctor recreated the crew of Voyager, including Chakotay, in order to help Seven of Nine improve her social skills. (VOY: "One")
Chakotay as an unscrupulous killer as imagined by the Kyrians
Lt. Barclay's recreated most of the crew of USS Voyager at the Communications Research Center on Earth for the Pathfinder Project in 2376. The Maquis crew members, including Chakotay, were not wearing Starfleet uniforms. (VOY: "Pathfinder")
In 2378, Seven recreated the crew of Voyager to perfect her social skills, including Chakotay, who is her romantic interest and encouraged her to explore her humanity through music and their relationship. He is sad when Seven ends their relationship, pleading with her to reconsider. This Chakotay can't cook, calling himself a more of a "replicator man". (VOY: "Human Error")
The Doctor's holonovel Photons Be Free was set aboard the USS Vortex and crewed by characters based on the crew of USS Voyager, albeit the names were change to protect the innocent. The character of Katanay was based on Chakotay. (VOY: "Author, Author")
The Doctor was forced to impersonate members of Voyager's crew during a crisis in 2378. One was Chakotay. (VOY: "Renaissance Man")
Alternate realities and timelines
In another timeline, Chakotay and Harry Kim flew the Delta Flyer to Earth after Voyager was destroyed due to a mistake of Kim's. Fifteen years later, as fugitives, they found Voyager and "fixed" history. (VOY: "Timeless")

Chakotay's grave
Another separate timeline was created when Captain Braxton, from the 29th century, placed a temporal disruptor aboard Voyager, creating several temporal distortions. At one point while Chakotay was giving a damage report to Captain Janeway, he passed through a temporal distortion, and appeared to echo – both his voice, and his appearance. (VOY: "Relativity")

In an alternate timeline, Chakotay married Seven of Nine, who later died on an away mission. He himself died in 2394, the same year as Voyager's return. According to Admiral Janeway, shortly after Voyager's return Chakotay died from grief over Seven's death. He had a grave marker at a cemetery on Earth. (VOY: "Endgame")

In another alternate timeline experienced by Kes, Chakotay was captain of the USS Voyager after Captain Janeway and B'Elanna Torres were killed by a chroniton torpedo in a Krenim attack in 2374. (VOY: "Before and After")

Appearances
VOY:  (Every episode, first appearance)
Background information
Chakotay was played by Robert Beltran during the course of Star Trek: Voyager. 

In "Tattoo", a younger Chakotay was played by Douglas Spain. In "Cathexis", he was briefly "portrayed" by Kate Mulgrew, Roxann Biggs-Dawson, Ethan Phillips, Garrett Wang, and Brian Markinson while possessing the bodies of their respective characters.

Chakotay was the first person to be seen in Star Trek: Voyager's series premiere, "Caretaker". In fact, the Native American character that became Chakotay was one of the first characters devised for Star Trek: Voyager. It was inspired by the positive influence that the character of Uhura has had on African-Americans. Commented Executive Producer Jeri Taylor, "It seemed to us [meaning herself, Rick Berman and Michael Piller] that Native Americans needed that same kind of role model and that same kind of boost… the future looks good, you have purpose, you have worth, you have value, you will be leaders, you will be powerful. That was one character choice we had early on." (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 174)

The as-yet-unnamed Native American was briefly mentioned in a set of handwritten notes that Taylor dated 30 July 1993, and the character was outlined on 3 August 1993, by which point his occupation as first officer for the new series (the similarly not-yet-named Star Trek: Voyager) had been decided upon. The outline read, "A Human native American male, 'Queegquog' person who has renounced Earth and lives as an expatriate on another planet. A mystical, mysterious man with whom the Captain has some prior connection, not explained." (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 175 & 176) On or by 17 August 1993, the producers decided that, due to the character's allegiance to the captain, he would not be a likely candidate for wanting, in conflict with her, to settle for being stranded from Earth in the unexplored space that served as the series' setting. It was also decided that it would be "his people," rather than himself, who had renounced Earth and were living as expatriates on another planet. "This man has made another choice – to re-enter the world of Starfleet," explained notes dated 17 August, which also replaced the word "mystical" with "complex". (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 188-189)

To find out more about the character's Native American background, the producers enlisted the assistance of Jamake Highwater. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 199) Around 21 September 1993, he forwarded the producers seven pages of research suggestions concerning Chakotay's background, though one point that remained undecided was the character's tribal ancestry. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 206) The fact that this had not been identified was noted in the first draft of the series writers' bible, which also named the character "Chakatoy". (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 208) Ultimately his introduction in the premiere's script simply described him as "an intense Native American man in his late thirties" with "a tattooed face." 

The Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "Preemptive Strike", which was written and aired well into Voyager's production phase, the lieutenant commander who Ro Laren refers to as her instructor at Advanced Tactical Training in 2369/2370, and who joined the Maquis, was intended as a reference to Chakotay. As was the Native American connection made in that epsiode, and previously in "Journey's End" (and "The Maquis, Part II"). (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (2nd ed., p. 298)} 

Indeed, these original intentions about Chakotay were included in Ro Laren's biography at StarTrek.com, but were ultimately nixed onscreen through contradictory information revealed in the Voyager fifth season episode "In the Flesh". Here, Chakotay stated that he resigned his commission on March 3, 2368, whereas according to his StarTrek.com biography, he resigned his commission in 2370.

Rank
Chakotay's rank insignia
Although Chakotay was invariably referred to as "commander" during the run of the series, his character wore what was indicated in reference materials to be the provisional officer rank insignia of a lieutenant commander (two solid stripes, one hollow stripe), a rank shared with his predecessor, Lt. Cmdr. Cavit. (Star Trek Encyclopedia (3rd ed., p. 211)) While remaining true to production intentions from "Preemptive Strike", this was apparently a costuming error that continued throughout the course of all seven seasons.

While it has been shown to be generally accepted in Star Trek to refer to officers by the higher ranking component of their actual rank, as indicated with both Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres being credited as "lieutenant", while in actuality being lieutenants junior grade, the same practice was not likely the case for Chakotay, who was otherwise identified as "Commander Chakotay" in the opening credits of virtually every episode from the first three seasons.

On Chakotay's choice to wear the provisional rank insignia (having resigned) versus being given standard commission like Tom Paris (who was discharged,) Star Trek: The Magazine Volume 1, Issue 19, p. 109, suggested that "while Chakotay would be entitled to a full commission, he chose to wear the same rank insignia as the rest of the Maquis, to show where his loyalties lay."

Cmdr. Chakotay (lower left)
Aside from being initially addressed as "Commander Chakotay" in "Caretaker", even before joining the crew of Voyager, at least two other instances formally referred to him as a full "commander". The first instance appeared on the crew manifest shown in "The Killing Game", while the second was referenced in "In the Flesh", where his name, rank, serial number, position, and assignment were collectively revealed by Boothby.

Character Bible description

The First Officer is a complex – some would say difficult – man. His background is unique: he spans two cultures, one foot in each, belonging to both and yet to neither. In the twenty-second century, a group of Indian traditionalists became dissatisfied with the "homogenization" of Humans that was occurring on Earth. Strongly motivated to preserve their cultural identity, they relocated to a remote planet near what has now become known as the Demilitarized Zone.

Chakotay is a member of that Indian nation, but was always what his people call a "contrary;" he had a mind of his own, an individualistic rather than communal way of thinking. Though proud of his heritage and his traditions, he was not satisfied to ignore the galaxy around him – a galaxy teeming with diverse life-forms and amazing technology. He broke from his people, educated himself in the ways of the twenty-fourth century, and attended Starfleet Academy.

But he was "contrary" at the Academy, also, and found he had difficulty adhering to the rigid codes and rules. He was commissioned and posted to the Merrimac just after the end of the Cardassian wars. When he learned that his people were becoming victims of attack by Cardassians, he left Starfleet to defend them, joining the then-infant group, Maquis. Chakotay never gave up his practice of traditional rituals, and he preserves them aboard Voyager. In his quarters is an Indian altar and other traditional ritual items. One wall contains a version of traditional mural art. He visits the Holodeck where he has a "habak" program for the celebration of his people's ceremonial cycle.

As an adolescent, Chakotay pursued a vision quest, and in doing so obtained a "spirit guide" – a timber wolf – which appears to him now in dreams and visions, and often guides him in his decision-making process.

He has a reverence for all living things, and when he eats he offers thanks to the earth for providing food; he will not eat meat; he takes no drugs or alcohol.

As a leader he is steady, fearless, and capable of inspiring absolute devotion. Though he comes onto Voyager more by necessity than choice, he quickly wins the respect of even the most die-hard Starfleet veterans. He strikes an immediate and powerful bond with Janeway, and an unusual one with Kim, who through Chakotay's example begins to question his own homogenization and the loss of his traditional values.
Apocrypha
In the novel Pathways it is stated that the Starfleet captain who sponsored Chakotay in applying to Starfleet Academy was Hiromi Sulu, the grandson of Hikaru Sulu, while in the short story "Seduced" from the anthology Tales from the Captain's Table, it is stated that it was Demora Sulu. That Chakotay referred to this captain as a "he" is explained as a deliberate deception on Chakotay's part as he did not believe that his father would have the same respect for a woman as he would for a man.

Pathways also asserts that Chakotay's homeworld is called Trebus, but the relaunch novels assert that he and his family were native to Dorvan V which – as established in Star Trek Monthly Issues 4 and 10 (pages 55 and 14, respectively) – the producers of Voyager initially intended to be Chakotay's homeworld, even though that contradicts with Chakotay's year of birth of 2329 and the fact that Dorvan V became a colony in 2350. 

Pathways references Chakotay originally having a room to himself at the academy, before being roomed with a Bolian named Chert, and being put on report by a dorm officer for not having his bed made with a mitered corner. These details were also included in an article on Starfleet Academy in Star Trek: The Magazine Volume 1, Issue 2, p. 104.

In the Voyager relaunch book series, Chakotay returned to Starfleet. His activities as a Maquis were pardoned, and his provisional rank was made official. Through the efforts of the former Captain Janeway, now a vice admiral, he himself was promoted to captain and given command of Voyager where Tom Paris served as his first officer. Chakotay and Seven subsequently ended their romantic liaison. The series also showed his younger sister, Sekaya, who had become a spiritual leader of their tribe. 

In the Voyager novel Full Circle, Chakotay and Janeway finally admitted their feelings for each other and began a romantic relationship in 2379; they agreed to meet again in Venice after Voyager's return from the Yaris nebula the following year. When Chakotay traveled to Venice to meet Janeway, however, he was greeted by her former fiancé Mark Johnson who revealed the news of her death. Distraught, Chakotay made a questionable and out of character command decision on his next mission. This and other questionable command decisions resulted in Chakotay requiring a psychological evaluation and eventually resigning from Starfleet altogether. In the Voyager novel Unworthy Chakotay finally returned to Starfleet and was once again given command of Voyager. In The Eternal Tide, Chakotay resumes his relationship with Janeway when she is brought back to life by Q's son and Kes. 

In an alternate timeline illustrated in the Star Trek: Myriad Universes novel Places of Exile, Voyager was forced to remain in the Delta Quadrant due to serious damage to the ship and Chakotay became a statesman in the Vostigye Union, which had become Voyager's new home. In this timeline, he and Janeway were romantically involved and had a daughter named Shannon Sekaya Janeway.
