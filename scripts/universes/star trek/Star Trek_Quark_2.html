Background information
Quark was played by Armin Shimerman in all of his appearances.

The Joan Pearce Research Associates noted in their initial report on the names and terms used in the DS9 pilot script that the word "Quark" was coined by Murray Gell-Mann "to denote a theoretical particle." Gell-Mann actually borrowed the word from James Joyce's 1939 novel Finnegans Wake: "Three quarks for Muster Mark." (The Making of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)

According to Michael Piller, one of the main inspirations for Quark's character was the bartender played by Frank McHugh in the 1939 Michael Curtiz film Dodge City, which also starred Errol Flynn. (New Frontiers: The Story of Deep Space Nine, DS9 Season 2 DVD special features) Piller also once stated that "Quark was probably the most fun, the most easily definable character we had. We knew exactly the role he was going to play." (Crew Dossier: Quark, DS9 Season 6 DVD special features) 

The original, 1992 Writers' Bible for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine  described the character thus:

Armin Shimerman initially appeared as Quark in "Emissary" with the prosthetic nose designed for Max Grodénchik's Rom, as his own nose was still being created. The prosthetic nose designed specially for Shimerman first appeared in "A Man Alone". (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion (p. ?))

Speaking in 1992, shortly after filming had begun on "Emissary", Armin Shimerman said of Quark, "I get along with most of the occupants of the station fairly well, but the Federation has this problem with me; they think of me as repugnant, although I think of myself as charming, they think of me as reprehensible, although I know I have a code of ethics, but they need to deal with because I'm a leader of the community. I'm a capitalist. The Federation is in the process of maintaining peace and stability in this sector of space. I'm only interested in that as much as it can make a profit for me. If prosperity and stability are unprofitable, then I'm going to the Cardassians, who are waiting on the edge, ready to leap in and take over if the Federation should leave." (Quark's Story, DS9 Season 2 DVD special features)

Speaking in 1999, shortly before filming finished on "What You Leave Behind", Shimerman said of Quark, "He started out as a rather greedy, insidious Ferengi character, much like the Ferengi from Next Generation. And as he resided on Deep Space 9, with a small community and other cultures, primarily the Human culture and the Bajoran culture, he began to assimilate into their ways, and his behavior became more and more Human, more and more empathetic, more and more congenial, and that was the growing arc for Quark." (Quark's Story, DS9 Season 2 DVD special features)

Speaking in 2002, Shimerman pointed out, "One of the great misunderstandings about Quark is that he was constantly cheating people of things and dealing in black market goods. This is absolutely true in the first two seasons. But the truth of the matter is, Quark became very domesticated after about the second season, and yet the characters on the show, and the audience, continued to believe he was always a scoundrel. I came to realize that after a time, he really wasn't stealing anymore. Yes, he was worried about his bottom line, but he was no longer actually doing nefarious things, he was no longer cheating, yet because he had started out that way, the characters in the show never really forgave him for a past life, a past life that he needed to do in order to survive under two oppressive regimes. Under the new regime, the regime of the Federation and the Bajorans, he became more domesticated and learned to take on the principles of the new society. And that's what happened over the seven years; he mellows out, and becomes more a part of the society he's living in, but it's the sort of subtle a normal Human being might go through if they found themselves surrounded by a new society." (Crew Dossier: Quark, DS9 Season 6 DVD special features)

Quark on the Ba'ku planet, in a scene cut from Insurrection
Quark's relationship with Odo is a clear homage to the classic 1942 Michael Curtiz film Casablanca, with Quark in Humphrey Bogart's role of Rick Blaine and Odo as Claude Rains' Captain Louis Renault.

A scene featuring Quark in Star Trek: Insurrection was devised by Michael Piller and Rick Berman while Piller was writing the film's first draft script. He later recalled, "We thought the discovery of a fountain of youth would suggest all sorts of profitable possibilities to him." (Fade In: The Making of Star Trek Insurrection [page number? • edit]) Armin Shimerman subsequently filmed Quark's cameo appearance for Star Trek: Insurrection, but his scenes were deleted prior to the film's release. Additionally, Quark was originally intended to make an appearance in TNG: "Chain of Command, Part I", but due to the pilot for DS9 being scheduled to air weeks after that episode, Quark was rewritten as DaiMon Solok. (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (2nd ed., p. 228))

Along with Evek, Morn, and Q, Quark is one of only four characters to appear in all of the first three Star Trek series based in the 24th century: Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and Star Trek: Voyager.

Quark, Julian Bashir, Morn, Admiral Chekote, and Gul Evek are the only characters to appear in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine prior to appearing in Star Trek: The Next Generation.

Quark is one of five characters to appear in two live action episodes intended as series premieres. Characters common to both (DS9: "Emissary" and VOY: "Caretaker") were Quark, Morn, Broik, Jean-Luc Picard and Miles O'Brien. However, he is one of six characters to appear in episodes that actually were series premieres, since Leonard McCoy was in TOS: "The Man Trap" – the first episode of TOS to be broadcast – and TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint".

According to StarTrek.com, Quark's birth year was c. 2333 (Terran equivalent).

Apocrypha
In the DS9 relaunch novels, Quark laments that his bar is likely going to have to close when Bajor joins the Federation and converts to the Federation's moneyless economy because it will put him out of business. Just as Quark prepares to close the bar down, he finds out that Rom has opened diplomatic relations between Ferenginar and Bajor, and that Rom has also arranged to have Quark's Bar be the official Ferengi Embassy to Bajor. This officially makes Quark the Ferengi Ambassador to Bajor and his bar sovereign Ferengi territory, allowing him to maintain it and still charge latinum for all his services.

In the novel The 34th Rule, Quark, Rom, and several Ferengi were interned at the Gallitep labor camp in 2372 when war was briefly declared between Ferenginar and Bajor. During their stay, they endured hideous treatment at the hands of the camp's insane warden, Colonel Mitra. After they escaped, Quark and Rom traveled to Ferenginar with Captain Sisko aboard the Defiant and successfully aided him in defusing the tense situation between the two worlds.

By the setting of Star Trek Online (2409/10), Quark appears to have become a successful business man, as evidenced by the fact that he no longer runs his own bar and that a dabo hologram of Leeta is produced by Quark Enterprises (which could, in theory, be a business connected to Rom, as it was his wife being recreated by Quark). He makes his official appearance in the game with the release of the "Victory is Life" expansion in June 2018, voiced once more by Armin Shimerman, and once again appearing in his bar on DS9. Much like his cousin Gaila had at one point, Quark mentions he now owns his own moon, and has debated turning his bar into a franchise, having "a Quark's in every quadrant." In the mission "Quark's Lucky Seven," a sequel of sorts to "The Magnificent Ferengi", Quark leads another commando team to reclaim the Sword of Kahless from the Iconians and ensures its delivery to his ex-wife Grilka (now married to Worf), as part of a plan to bring the Klingon Empire fully into the conflict with the Hur'q.

Quark of the alternate reality
The alternate reality version of Quark appears in the Star Trek: Ongoing story arc The Q Gambit where he is a merchant hired by his old friend Julian Bashir to smuggle Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy off Bajor in cargo containers and get them back to the USS Enterprise. Aboard Quark's ship, Spock and McCoy meet Kira Nerys, who makes plans take a shuttle to the hidden base of the Free Federation Resistance and supply them when she asks Quark wrap up the Reckoning Tablet and bring it aboard, but Quark reveals he will not be helping them. Opening the cargo bay doors to reveal Cardassian soldiers, he explains to them that the Dominion made him a better offer than the Resistance and have won his loyalty.
