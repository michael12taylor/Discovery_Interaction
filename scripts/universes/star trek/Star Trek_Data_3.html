<html><p>The comic book series Star Trek: Countdown, a tie-in to the 2009 Star Trek film, depicts Data as alive in 2387, having successfully imprinted his neural nets onto B-4's programming; at one point, Spock, who was also brought back to life after dying, makes a note of the incredibly unique life experience the two share. In the comic, Data had become captain of the Enterprise-E; along with Captain Picard, his face is seen in the film's comic adaptation, in which the Delta Vega mind-meld scene is depicted with a collage of images from Countdown. This promotion to captain is one of the pieces of trivia that appears on loading screens in Star Trek Online. The short story "Unexpected Honor", appearing in Star Trek MagazineÂ issue 167 (pp. 90-93) in 2012, shows Data's captaincy ending with the Enterprise-E's destruction at the hands of the Undine in 2408; afterwards, Data retires from Starfleet to teach at the University of Oxford, a possible nod to the anti-time future in "All Good Things..." where he also became a university professor after leaving Starfleet.

In the short story Our Million-Year Mission, set a million years in the future, Data Soong is a crewmember aboard the UberEnterprise, a ship populated by holographic replicas of famous Starfleet officers. He has modified himself to be able to experience every nuance of Human emotion as well as many alien ones.
