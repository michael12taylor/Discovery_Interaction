<html><p>The relationship built up on DS9 between O'Brien and Bashir was very important to all of the writers, as well as both actors. According to Ronald D. Moore, after the scene where they sing the British patriotic hymn "Jerusalem" together in DS9: "Explorers", all of the staff writers wanted to write scenes involving their friendship. Alexander Siddig says, "it's been said, by even the producers, that O'Brien and Bashir are the only real friendship that's ever happened on Star Trek. These two really are friends. It's not like some kind of odd couple scenario, like Spock and Kirk. It's a real friendship. These people talk about inane things, and I think that's been really refreshing." Robert Hewitt Wolfe elaborates, "It was just great. There was just great chemistry between the two actors, great chemistry between the two characters. It was brilliant of Michael and Rick to create these two characters as foils for each other. And to then see this relationship develop over the years till they're best friends, till Miles actually likes Bashir kind of almost better than his wife some days, which is very real, I mean there's days that everybody, you know, it's easier to be friends with a friend than with your wife some days." (Crew Dossier: Miles O'Brien, DS9 Season 5 DVD, Special Features) Ira Behr goes even further, and cites it as his favorite relationship in all of Star Trek; "The relationship between Bashir and O'Brien is the best relationship, the best friendship, in the history of the franchise. Spock and Kirk were still about the captain and his number one. This is a friendship with two equals, two guys. It's a wonderful thing to watch how this relationship has grown." (Crew Dossier: Julian Bashir, DS9 Season 6 DVD, Special Features)

Trivia
O'Brien is one of two enlisted characters in Star Trek to have received any significant character development, the other being Yeoman Janice Rand.

O'Brien is one of five characters to appear in two series premieres (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint" and DS9: "Emissary"), the others being Jean-Luc Picard (same episodes as O'Brien), Quark, Morn, and Broik (in both DS9: "Emissary" and VOY: "Caretaker").

O'Brien is one of four characters to appear in two series finales (TNG: "All Good Things..." and DS9: "What You Leave Behind"), the others being Worf (same episodes as O'Brien), William T. Riker and Deanna Troi (both in TNG: "All Good Things..." and ENT: "These Are the Voyages...").

O'Brien is the only character to appear in two series premieres and two series finales, (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint" and DS9: "Emissary"), and (TNG: "All Good Things..." and DS9: "What You Leave Behind").

Problematic rank history
The character of Miles O'Brien, and the exact rank he held in Star Trek, has a history of its own spanning the length of the character's existence. 

In thirteen years of the character's appearances, only in the last four was his rank established to be presumably senior chief petty officer (although this term was never directly used on screen). Through various other stages of the character's development, O'Brien was referred to as a crewman, a lieutenant, and various script notes indicated he was a "warrant officer."  The novelization of Emissary indicated O'Brien held a rank known as "ensign junior grade". 

The exact history of O'Brien's ranks are as follows:

1987: Appears in "Encounter at Farpoint" and is referred to as "Conn" (not as a name, but showing he was conducting the movements of the ship). In this episode, O'Brien wears the single pip of a Starfleet ensign (1) and a red command division uniform. In "Lonely Among Us" he appears again, with no apparent insignia, credited as First Security Guard and in the corresponding yellow operations division uniform.

1988: Appears in "The Child", credited as Transporter Chief. He wears the two pips of a Starfleet lieutenant (2). In "Where Silence Has Lease" he appears wearing the same uniform and insignia as "The Child" and is directly addressed by Commander Riker as "lieutenant", seemingly indicating that O'Brien is an officer.

1989: O'Brien's surname is mentioned for the first time in "Unnatural Selection". He is wearing the two pips of a Starfleet lieutenant again and is addressed as chief.

1989: Appears in "The Emissary", again wearing two pips. Toward the end of the episode, then Lieutenant junior grade Worf gives him transporter coordinates. After entering them, Worf says "I relieve you", to which O'Brien replies, "Well I… yes, lieutenant", which is the correct way to formally address someone of inferior rank (if Worf had been his superior, it would likely have been "sir"). There have been multiple examples in Starfleet of position trumping rank, such as a bridge officer being left in command of a ship, even when a superior officer is on duty in engineering.

1990: Appears in "Family" and is addressed as "another chief petty officer" by Sergey Rozhenko, even though he is shown wearing lieutenant's pips, and is given a first (and middle) name, three years after his first appearance. From this point on, O'Brien's character is developed as a senior enlisted member of the Enterprise crew, although he continued to wear the lieutenant's insignia.

Ronald D. Moore commented, "O'Brien was originally just a day player on TNG and very little, if any, thought went into his rank or background for quite a while. He officially became a Chief Petty Officer in "Family" when I wanted he and Worf's adoptive father to both be non-coms in contrast to Worf. Making him an enlisted man seemed to give us another color in the show and to open up another window into Starfleet that we hadn't explored before." (AOL chat, 1998)
1991: Appears in "Data's Day" wearing his usual uniform and insignia. At the end of the episode, O'Brien wears a dress uniform also with the two pip insignia of a lieutenant. Later in "Clues", he mentions Ensign Locklin to be "one of his technicians", once more suggesting a higher rank in line with his two rank pips. 

1992: Appears in "Realm of Fear" where O'Brien is given direct orders by Reginald Barclay (who is a lieutenant junior grade) thus firming up the idea that O'Brien is a noncom as opposed to an commissioned officer. This episode marks the first time that O'Brien wears the single hollow pip with his regular uniform (3). (The Star Trek Encyclopedia (2nd ed., p. 211) defines this as the insignia of a "chief warrant officer", although the term is never used on-screen.)

1993: Appears in "Emissary", where he transfers to Deep Space 9 to take a new position as its "chief of operations". In "A Man Alone", this transfer is described as a "promotion". For the next three years, O'Brien wears a single hollow pip insignia with his rank again very much in question. Script notes from several Deep Space Nine episodes indicate he is a "warrant officer", while the pilot's novelization states O'Brien is an "ensign junior grade" (3).

1994: Appears in "Paradise" where he briefly describes the history of how he became tactical officer and "got [his] gold suit" on the USS Rutledge. In the next episode, "Shadowplay", his title is stated to be senior chief specialist. He appears also in the past segment of "All Good Things..." wearing the single pip of a Starfleet ensign, which is consistent with what was worn during "Encounter at Farpoint" (1). The Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (2nd ed., p. 301) incorrectly reports that O'Brien wears a single hollow pip during the episode.

In "Tribunal", O'Brien told Raymond Boone he was Chief Engineer of Deep Space 9, rather than Chief of Operations.
In "Facets", after Nog passes the entry exam for Starfleet Academy, O'Brien mentions to Bashir that if Nog graduates from the Academy, he [O'Brien] will have to address Nog as "sir." Despite this, Nog (upon becoming an ensign) still referred to the chief as "sir."
1995: In "Past Tense, Part I", when the other officers are lamenting having to attend a formal Starfleet function, O'Brien is asked if he would like to attend. He half-jokes, "Full dress uniform, fine table linens, a different fork for every course? No thanks, that's why I stayed an enlisted man. They don't expect me to show up for these formal dinners."

1995: By the time of "Hippocratic Oath", O'Brien has begun to wear a new insignia reminiscent of the chevron rank used by modern-day master chief petty officers in the US Navy (4). In this episode, a Jem'Hadar familiar with Starfleet insignia identifies it as a chief petty officer insignia. Presumably it was actually senior chief petty officer, as the word senior was used in "Shadowplay", so the Jem'Hadar presumably simply left out the distinction. His dress uniform in "Crossfire" displays no rank insignia, but in "Rules of Engagement" it has the single hollow pip.

Possible explanations for O'Brien's various titles and insignia include:

During some points of The Next Generation, O'Brien may have held a field commission as an officer, which would explain why Riker once called him a lieutenant. His continuous wearing of two pips (which is the standard insignia of a lieutenant) might be a type of "honorary insignia" even though he was later clearly referred to as a chief petty officer.
Starfleet non-commissioned officer insignia might be identical to officer insignia, with the number of pips worn by an noncom indicating level of seniority as a chief petty officer. Under this system, one pip would equal a chief petty officer, two a senior chief, and three a master chief. With O'Brien wearing two pips throughout The Next Generation, this would equate with his final rank of senior chief petty officer in Deep Space Nine.
Ranks for starbase personnel may simply differ in name from personnel serving on starships.
The original intention for warrant officers (senior enlisted personnel) in the old British system most Western militaries take their traditions from, was that they held a "warrant" entitling them to the same authority of a commissioned officer but within the narrow field in which they are an expert. Thus, a transporter "chief" may, with respect to the operation and maintenance of transporters, hold a warrant granting the same authority as a lieutenant and therefore he may wear the rank insignia designating him as such.  This could explain the slight hesitation he displayed in the 1989 episode "The Emmisary" where Worf, a Lieutenant JG, relieves him.  Normally in the operation of a transporter, his authority may supersede Worf's , but as a commissioned officer, Worf may have held a more general authority and was exercising that.  His response to Worf is the correct formal response of a superior rank to a junior who, is by nature of position or authority, relieving him.
In Kayshon, His Eyes Open, it is suggested that oftentimes when a character appears with the incorrect number of pips, the additional pip is a kernel of corn. Although O'Brien's rank pips are clearly actual pips and not kernels of corn, this line may have been a tongue-in-cheek attempt to explain away such inconsistencies as O'Brien's. However, this would only potentially reduce his rank insignia to that of an Ensign and does not resolve the inconsistency of either him being explicitly called Lieutenant or his later-stated status as a non-commissioned offer.

Some problems with assuming that O'Brien is a Starfleet chief petty officer include:

The entire backstory seen in "The Wounded" reveals that O'Brien was once a senior department head officer under the command of Captain Benjamin Maxwell. With O'Brien being a chief petty officer on board the Enterprise, it stands to reason that he was either a very junior CPO or perhaps even an ordinary petty officer under Maxwell. With the duties O'Brien was stated to have held (tactical officer), this creates a problem since nowhere else in Star Trek has an enlisted person been seen holding such a high-level position. It is important to note that O'Brien's service under Maxwell occurred during the Federation-Cardassian Border War. Under wartime conditions, lower ranked officers and perhaps even non-commissioned crew members may have been pressed into service in places where they would not otherwise have the opportunity to serve during peacetime.
At one point, O'Brien appears to have had officers working for him. Such was the case in "Clues", in which O'Brien states that an ensign was "one of his technicians". This may be explained by O'Brien holding a type of "positional authority" which would grant him authority to officers due to his position as transporter chief, even though he was militarily junior. This continued well into his tenure on Deep Space 9, with an ensign in "Emissary" addressing him as "sir", several members of his staff appearing to be ensigns or lieutenants and Nog clearly being subordinate to O'Brien despite holding the rank of ensign. However, in the whole DS9 series, it is continuously stated that O'Brien is chief engineer of the station and as mentioned above this position often trumps the rank someone holds.
Julian Bashir once remarked in "Trials and Tribble-ations" that O'Brien had attended Starfleet Academy, which is a training school for commissioned officers and not noncoms. Ronald D. Moore remarked, "This is a mistake, plain and simple. If you want to rationalize it, I suppose we could say that the enlisted training program also takes place at the Academy." (AOL chat, 1998) The idea of Starfleet Academy training enlisted personnel was also backed up by statements of Simon Tarses in "The Drumhead".
In the end, it may be nothing more complicated than that in the early days of TNG when he was little more than a regular extra, scripts just assumed he was an officer because there were never any actual enlisted personnel shown on screen. His later specification at the rank of "chief" would, then, be nothing more than the fact that his in-character position in TNG as transporter chief made it easy to call him an actual chief later on and to flesh him out in the role of an enlisted person.  Trying to attribute in-character canon reasons to the out-of-character decisions (to flesh out the cast of DS9 with people familiar to TNG-viewers) may, therefore, not be possible and it may be one of those things where it is better to just accept that there are imperfections in the canon accounts.

Apocrypha
In post-finale novels, O'Brien relocates from Earth to Cardassia in the year after DS9 ended. (Unity, Worlds of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Volume One)

In the Star Trek: Typhon Pact novel Raise the Dawn, O'Brien is reassigned as chief engineer following the destruction of Deep Space 9 in 2383 of both the ground-based facility that substituted for it and supervising the Starfleet Corps of Engineers in the construction of the new, replacement station.

In the Star Trek: The Fall novel Revelation and Dust, O'Brien takes over as chief engineer of the new Deep Space 9 after its construction was completed.

Miles O'Brien of the alternate reality
The alternate reality version of Miles O'Brien appears in the Star Trek: Ongoing story arc The Q Gambit in which he is a member of the Free Federation Resistance with the rank of lieutenant and is first officer of the USS Defiant, with his wife Keiko as captain of the Defiant. He rescues Sisko, Odo, James T. Kirk, Montgomery Scott, and Nyota Uhura from Changelings after they had murdered Chancellor Worf using a shuttle and when they get back to the Defiant, O'Brien is assisted by Scott in fixing the ship's warp drive during which the two of them discuss and bond over their mutual love of engineering.
