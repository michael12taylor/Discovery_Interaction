Early life
Annika was born in 2350 on stardate 25479 at the Federation Tendara colony as the only daughter of eccentric exobiologists Magnus and Erin Hansen. (VOY: "Dark Frontier")

During her childhood, she never visited Earth. (VOY: "Hunters") Her favorite color growing up was red. (VOY: "The Gift") At the age of six, Annika once stayed with her Aunt Irene. Her favorite treats were strawberry tarts, which Irene used to coax Annika out of a guest room in which she had locked herself. She was very strong-willed and did not hesitate to point out if the strawberries used in baking the tarts were not perfectly ripe. (VOY: "Author, Author") At one point in her childhood, she wanted to become a ballerina. (VOY: "One Small Step")

Time on the Raven
Annika Hansen aboard the Raven in 2356
Annika's parents were exobiologists investigating the existence of the Borg. After a great deal of persuasion, the Federation granted the Hansens the use of the USS Raven, a small long-range craft, to aid them in their investigation. 

In 2353, they took Annika, then aged three, along with them. They spent a good deal of time aboard the Raven in search of the Borg; Annika celebrated three birthdays aboard the ship. Eventually, the Hansens encountered a Borg cube and followed it through its transwarp conduit into the Delta Quadrant, the Borg's region of origin. They gathered a great deal of scientific data on the biology of Borg drones and the nature of the Collective by moving undetected through Borg space due to multi-adaptive shielding, invented by Magnus Hansen. They even went aboard Borg vessels, using bio-dampeners to remain undetected. 

Their research came to an abrupt end in 2356 when an ion storm struck the Raven. The ship sustained damage, including, most importantly, damage to the multi-adaptive shielding, which went off-line for 13.2 seconds. This left them exposed long enough for the Borg to detect them and perceive them as a target for assimilation. The Hansens tried to evade pursuit by masking the Raven's warp trail, but the Borg still managed to pursue and find them. They and their daughter were promptly captured and assimilated near B'omar space. Naturally, the experience was traumatizing for Annika. (VOY: "The Raven", "Dark Frontier")

Life as a Borg drone
Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01
Annika was placed in a maturation chamber, where the hive mind began to restructure her synaptic pathways and purge her individuality. She emerged as a Borg drone five years later in 2361, the turmoil of having been forcibly assimilated replaced with order, and spent the next thirteen years in the Collective with the designation Seven of Nine. As a drone, she assisted in the assimilation of millions, from individuals to entire species. She personally assimilated many individuals from a variety of species, including Humans, Klingons, Ferengi, Bajorans, Bolians, Krenim, and Cardassians. (VOY: "Infinite Regress", "Collective")

In early 2368, the Borg sphere that Seven of Nine, along with three other drones in her unimatrix, crash landed on a planet in the Delta Quadrant. The other drones, who were assimilated as adults, began to regain their identities upon being severed from the Borg Collective, but Seven was frightened as she knew nothing else but life as a drone. She forcibly linked the other drones together into a temporary collective in order to suppress their identities, and they were retrieved soon after. (VOY: "Survival Instinct") Seven of Nine remained a Borg drone until 2374, when she was liberated. (VOY: "Scorpion, Part II", "The Gift")

USS Voyager
Torn from the Collective
Disconnected from the Collective
During the brief war between the Borg and Species 8472 in late 2373, the USS Voyager was caught between the two belligerents. Seeking to protect her crew, and being made aware of the extreme threat to the galaxy posed by Species 8472, Captain Kathryn Janeway forged an alliance with the Borg, offering them the technology behind modified Borg nanoprobes which could be used as biological photon torpedo warheads against their common enemy, in exchange for safe passage through Borg space and non-assimilation. The Collective assigned Seven of Nine to work with Voyager to develop the weapon. When her cube sacrificed itself to save Voyager from an attacking 8472 bio-ship, she and a small number of drones beamed onto Voyager to continue the work. Janeway was severely injured, leaving her first officer, Commander Chakotay, in command. Seven of Nine wanted Voyager to go to another cube, but Chakotay refused. The drones attempted to commandeer Voyager's navigation systems to take it to the nearest cube, but Chakotay decompressed the deck the drones were on, blowing them into space. Seven of Nine, however, managed to remain aboard. Instructed to do so by the Collective, she took Voyager into Species 8472's realm, forcing deployment of the modified nanoprobe torpedoes to protect the ship. A recovered Janeway resumed command and reinstated the alliance. The torpedoes proved effective. Now vulnerable, 8472 retreated. However, the Collective broke the alliance and Seven of Nine attempted to take Voyager to be assimilated. But this was anticipated and a contingency plan was successfully enacted which permanently severed her link to the Collective. Janeway decided to keep Seven of Nine aboard. (VOY: "Scorpion", "Scorpion, Part II")

Seven confronts Janeway about being separated from the Collective
The transition back to Humanity was difficult for Seven of Nine. She appeared to accept her severance from the Collective, but tried to contact it at the first opportunity. She was stopped, however. (VOY: "The Gift")

The Doctor, Voyager's holographic chief medical officer, was able to remove most of her implants and restore most of her Human appearance, but her long-term assimilation meant that some parts were vital to her survival and could not be removed. She also refused to be called by her name of Annika Hansen as Seven of Nine was the designation she had always known. But she accepted a shortened version, "Seven" at the suggestion of Captain Janeway. (VOY: "Day of Honor")

Shortly after Seven was freed from the collective, Voyager neared a moon in B'omar space, the location of the crashed wreck of the Raven, which had been partially assimilated by the Borg when they caught it. A Borg homing beacon aboard was still active. Seven began experiencing visions of a raven and flashbacks to the time she was assimilated. The beacon reactivated several of Seven's nanoprobes, giving her an irresistible drive to find the source of the beacon. She escaped Voyager in a shuttlecraft and flew to the moon, discovered the ship and recovered the entire memory of her assimilation. (VOY: "The Raven")

Scientific accomplishments
Seven of Nine at her station on the bridge
During her first few months on Voyager, Seven attempted to help the engineering crew modify the warp drive to generate transwarp conduits. The efforts failed, and almost cost Voyager its warp core in the process. (VOY: "Day of Honor")

Along with Ensign Harry Kim, Seven of Nine designed and constructed the ship's astrometrics lab, which used Borg technology to plot routes that trimmed several years off of Voyager's journey. The lab became an important asset to Voyager and was Seven's domain for the rest of the journey. (VOY: "Revulsion", "Year of Hell")  Using the astrometrics lab, Seven discovered the Hirogen communications network, which allowed Voyager to temporarily receive messages from the Alpha Quadrant. (VOY: "Hunters")  When monthly data streams and, later, real-time communication became possible, Seven helped implement enhancements to Voyager's deflector dish. (VOY: "Life Line", "Author, Author")

Seven developed a technique for using Borg nanoprobes to revive an individual who had been dead several hours. It was used on Neelix in 2374. (VOY: "Mortal Coil")

A team led by Seven adapted a Borg design to contain and destroy Omega molecules found in the Delta Quadrant in 2374. The molecules temporarily stabilized while in the chamber. Seven was the only one to see it happen; as the Borg considered the Omega Molecule to be "perfection" in its purest form (but had never been able to stabilize it), the former drone underwent what could be described as a religious experience when she saw Omega spontaneously stabilize. (VOY: "The Omega Directive")

Seven was part of the team which designed and built the Delta Flyer shuttlecraft in 2375. She developed Borg-based technology and weapons for it. (VOY: "Extreme Risk")

Seven assisted in the construction of the quantum slipstream drive installed aboard Voyager in 2375. In an alternate timeline, the use of the drive destroyed the ship, killing her and everyone else aboard. However, just after the drive was activated, a signal from that timeline was received by Seven via her cortical implants. This signal contained phase corrections that, when used, collapsed the slipstream, eliminating that timeline and saving the ship and crew. (VOY: "Timeless")

When Voyager crossed the territory of the anti-telepathic Devore in 2375, Seven helped develop a transporter suspension technique in order to hide telepathic crewmembers and Brenari refugees. (VOY: "Counterpoint")

She also gave Voyager the possibility to use a transwarp coil, which was then used to save her from the Borg and then to advance twenty thousand light years towards home. (VOY: "Dark Frontier")

In 2376, Seven developed enhancements to her alcove that allowed her to process information and make connections between various events while she regenerated. This allowed Seven to deduce that photonic fleas had been degrading sensor efficiency and that a catapult built by an alien named Tash employed a tetryon reactor like that of the Caretaker's array. However, the process overloaded her cortical implants, and she began drawing wild conclusions concerning Voyager's mission and crew. She convinced Chakotay that Voyager's presence in the Delta Quadrant was intentional and a prelude to a joint Federation/Cardassian invasion, while later telling Captain Janeway that Chakotay was organizing a Maquis rebellion, using technology of the Caretaker, to launch strikes on Federation and Cardassian targets. She then began to believe that Voyager was sent to the Delta Quadrant to retrieve her from the Borg Collective, and that she would be analyzed and dissected upon return to the Alpha Quadrant. She left the ship in the Delta Flyer, but Janeway was able to convince her that this 'conspiracy' was only a delusion caused by her alcove enhancements. She returned to Voyager and the enhancements were removed. (VOY: "The Voyager Conspiracy")

A hologram of Reginald Barclay was transmitted to Voyager in early 2377. The hologram supposedly brought information to Voyager about using a geodesic fold to return the ship to the Alpha Quadrant. In reality, the hologram had been intercepted and reprogrammed by Ferengi, who wanted to harvest Seven of Nine's nanoprobes and sell them for profit. Although the holo-Barclay claimed modifications to the shields would protect Voyager while in the fold, Seven eventually discovered that the hologram was deceiving them. (VOY: "Inside Man")

Moral conflicts
Voyager rescued a member of Species 8472 from a Hirogen hunting party in mid 2374. Captain Janeway wanted to return the creature to its native fluidic space because it had told Tuvok of its plight telepathically; it meant no harm and just wanted to go home. The Hirogen, however, wanted to hunt and kill it. They threatened to destroy Voyager unless the 8472 was returned to them. Seven felt that it should be surrendered in order to protect Voyager, but Captain Janeway strongly disagreed, saying that it was wrong to sacrifice another lifeform to save themselves. Seven refused to help open a quantum singularity into fluidic space to allow the 8472 to return to its realm, and Janeway confined her to the cargo bay. The Doctor needed nanoprobes to help treat the injured alien, and Seven was ordered to bring them to The Doctor so he could treat it. At the same time, a Hirogen hunter who had been injured from his initial hunt of the 8472, and who The Doctor had been treating, attacked the 8472. Seven transported both the Hirogen and the Species 8472 to a Hirogen vessel, which then retreated. Janeway was not happy with Seven's conduct, and revoked most of her privileges until she proved trustworthy once again. Seven believed she was being punished for asserting her individuality and her personal beliefs, which the Voyager crew had fostered since she had been freed from the Collective. (VOY: "Prey")

Voyager encountered Entharan weapons broker Kovin in 2374. Seven worked with him and viewed the weapons he offered to sell, but was very much uncomfortable around him. She later struck him in engineering. With The Doctor's help, Seven recovered memories which suggested Kovin had assaulted her and stolen nanoprobes for use as weapons. Circumstantial evidence also supported her story, and Voyager tried to apprehend Kovin. It is later determined that her memories were simply ones from her time as a Borg drone mixed with experiences of Kovin. Unfortunately, Kovin was killed when Voyager tried to contact him and tell him of his innocence. Both Seven and The Doctor experienced deep remorse over contributing to Kovin's death. (VOY: "Retrospect")

Working to contain the Omega particles
When the Omega particles were found in the Delta Quadrant, Seven held a certain fascination with them, since the Borg had tried, unsuccessfully, to stabilize the molecules. She believed they held the key to perfection and that she would be able to use the Borg research to stabilize the molecules. However, Captain Janeway believed it was too risky and the molecules were destroyed. They spontaneously stabilized shortly before being destroyed by Voyager. Seven witnessed this and experienced one of her first spiritual moments in the process. (VOY: "The Omega Directive")

A race of bounty hunters known as the Hazari began attacking Voyager in 2375. A group of aliens called the Think Tank offered to help Voyager defeat the Hazari, but wanted Seven of Nine as payment. Kurros, a member of the Think Tank, tried to appeal to Seven's quest for perfection and have her join willingly, but she declined his offer. Further investigation revealed that Kurros had hired the Hazari to attack Voyager for the express purpose of taking Seven of Nine. The crew developed a plan with the Hazari which involved Seven willingly joining the Think Tank. Once with them, she would disable systems aboard their vessel. Kurros sensed deception, and forced Seven to link with the Think Tank's telepathic net. She overloaded the network as the link was established, disrupting the function of their entire ship. Seven was returned to Voyager as the Think Tank was overwhelmed with a Hazari attack squadron. (VOY: "Think Tank")

In 2376, Voyager docked at a Markonian outpost. While there, Seven of Nine encountered the group of drones which she had linked together eight years prior. They had since been liberated from the Collective, but were permanently linked due to Seven's modifications. They attacked Seven in order to find out what she had done to them, but were stopped by Voyager security. Seven later voluntarily linked with the drones to retrieve the memories of the crash, but further damage was caused when the link was broken. Even though the drones were no longer connected to one another, all but Seven were left comatose. They needed their neural implants removed, but it would only give them a month to live. They could be saved if reassimilated into the Borg Collective, but Seven decided that a brief life as an individual was much more valuable than eternal life as a drone, and she ordered The Doctor to remove the implants. The former drones were still upset about the decision made by Seven eight years prior, but understood her reasons and were grateful for their new-found freedom, however short. (VOY: "Survival Instinct")

Also that year, Seven was part of an away team which discovered the Vaadwaur race, placed in stasis centuries prior. Seven was excited at the prospect of helping to rebuild a society in order to atone for the destruction she participated in while a member of the Collective, and worked with the Vaadwaur to find them a new home. It was later determined that the Vaadwaur were warlike and hostile, and their awakening placed the region of space near their homeworld in great danger. Seven was upset that her intention to help may have caused further suffering. (VOY: "Dragon's Teeth")

Again during the same year, Seven and an injured Tuvok were captured by Penk, a Norcadian who organized the spectator sport Tsunkatse, and Seven was forced to fight in the ring. After rescue, Tuvok thanked her for taking his place in a red match and asked if she had recovered. Seven said that her victory only came from her loss of control, and worried that the three years she had spent regaining her Humanity were lost in the ring. However, Tuvok pointed out that her feelings of guilt, shame and remorse meant that her Humanity had been reaffirmed, not lost. (VOY: "Tsunkatse")

Seven held hostage by Iko
In 2377, Seven became friends with a Nygean man named Iko, who had committed murder and had been sentenced to death on his homeworld. Initially, Iko took Seven prisoner when he was beamed aboard Voyager and made threats to the crew. He later became remorseful when his body and conscience were "healed" by Seven's nanoprobes after he was severely beaten by Yediq, the prison warden, when he threatened his family. Seven tried to help him avoid his death sentence, but his crime could not be forgiven by the victim's family and he was put to death. Seven was left troubled at the idea that Iko was executed for one murder while she had never been punished for her own actions in the Borg, but Janeway assured her that her time in the Collective was punishment enough. (VOY: "Repentance")

Dealings with the Borg
Stealing a transwarp coil
While transporting back to Voyager in 2375, a malfunction caused nanoprobes from Seven's bloodstream to merge with The Doctor's mobile emitter. The nanoprobes quickly assimilated the advanced 29th century technology, and used genetic material from Mulchaey to create an advanced Borg drone, with the emitter at its core. The drone lacked Borg programming, giving Seven the opportunity to communicate with him. She attempted to teach him to be an individual, and he was even given the name One by Neelix, but he wished to learn more about the Borg. Attempts to prevent the Borg from detecting One failed and his attempts to modify Voyager's weapons to fight them proved insufficient. He transported aboard the Borg vessel, destroying it from within. His built-in shielding allowed him to survive the explosion badly injured, but he refused treatment and died in Voyager's sickbay to keep the crew safe from constant assimilation threats. Seven mourned him as if she had lost a son. (VOY: "Drone")

Seven in Unimatrix Zero as Annika Hansen
Later in 2375, Voyager's crew prepared for a daring raid on a damaged Borg sphere in order to steal a transwarp coil and substantially shorten their journey home. Seven was contacted by the Borg Queen, who revealed that she had set a trap for Voyager and its crew would be assimilated if she did not return to the Collective. Seven reluctantly agreed, learning that she was deliberately granted her freedom as part of a larger plan to assimilate Humanity. Seven resisted the Queen's attempts to convince her to develop a nanoprobe virus and was eventually rescued by Voyager's crew. (VOY: "Dark Frontier")

In 2377 she discovered that she was one of a few Borg with a certain assimilation mutation that allowed them to retain their individuality while regenerating inside of an artificial construct known as Unimatrix Zero. Freed from the Collective, she was once again contacted by the others inside. They were on the verge of being discovered and needed her help. With some assistance from Voyager's crew, the drones were given the ability to retain their individuality outside of the construct. This allowed them to launch an open revolt against the Collective, plunging the Collective into civil war. (VOY: "Unimatrix Zero", "Unimatrix Zero, Part II")

Identity crises
When the Hirogen overtook Voyager in 2374 and used its crew and holodecks to conduct hunts, Seven was assigned the identity of Mademoiselle de Neuf (literally, "Miss of Nine") in the French Resistance holoprogram. The Doctor was able to modify her Borg implants and restore her real identity without the Hirogen knowing. She worked with The Doctor and Ensign Kim to stage a counterstrike against the Hirogen and restore the identities of the rest of the crew. (VOY: "The Killing Game") Seven later modified explosives to emit a photonic burst which disabled holographic activity on part of the ship, a crucial event which allowed Captain Janeway to defeat the leader of the Hirogen and return control of the ship to the Starfleet crew. (VOY: "The Killing Game, Part II")

One of Seven's personalities: eating like a Klingon
Seven was stricken with something akin to a multiple-personality disorder in 2375 when Voyager neared a vinculum infected with a synthetic pathogen by Species 6339. Several personalities, including Starfleet officers, a Klingon warrior, a Vulcan official, a Krenim scientist, a Ferengi trader, a woman trying to find her son aboard the USS Melbourne at the Battle of Wolf 359, and a frightened young child, emerged. These turned out to be personalities of individuals assimilated by Seven, and it was soon made clear the malfunctions in her implants were precisely what Species 6339 wished to inflict on the rest of the Collective. The personalities began to take over Seven, and her own individuality was lost. Tuvok was able to use a mind meld to retrieve Seven's consciousness and the vinculum was deactivated. (VOY: "Infinite Regress")

In 2377, Voyager's crew was forced to abandon ship after hitting a subspace mine. They were rescued by rogue elements of the Quarren, and had their identities reassigned in order to supply labor and fill a shortage on the Quarren homeworld. The entire crew, except Chakotay, Kim, and Neelix, who were away on the Delta Flyer, had their memories of Voyager erased and false memories of terrible conditions on their homeworlds implanted. Seven started to use her real name, Annika Hansen, and was given a job as an efficiency monitor in a power distribution plant, working with several other Voyager crew members including Captain Janeway, Tuvok, and B'Elanna Torres. Her Borg desire for perfection made her perfectly suited for the job, and she was often overzealous in chastising workers. The identity reassignment did not completely work on Tuvok, though, and he began to remember his former life, including Seven of Nine. He mind-melded with her, causing memories of her life on Voyager and as a drone to resurface. (VOY: "Workforce") As the flashbacks continued, Annika investigated Tuvok's records. She believed there was a connection to the disappearance of Torres, who had been rescued by the remaining Voyager crew, and Annika later learned that Tuvok had accessed files of most of the Voyager crew, including Janeway, Torres, and herself. This led her to realize the inconsistency that many new workers from the same species began work on the same day, which was unusual during a labor shortage. Additionally, they were all brought through the neuropathology division, although none of the workers remembered this. Her suspicions were dismissed and explained as an outbreak of Dysphoria Syndrome. Annika was undaunted, and later visited the neuropathology division complaining of the flashbacks in order to access their computer system. While there, she discovered the Dysphoria Syndrome outbreak was actually a cover-up masterminded by a Quarren doctor called Kadan, to hide the fact that Voyager's crew and many others had been abducted. This confirmed the story Chakotay had told to Captain Janeway, and Annika and a Quarren official, Yerid, went to the hospital to prevent Kadan from using the reassignment technique on Chakotay and Tuvok. They succeeded, and the entire Voyager crew was transported back to the ship. The Doctor was successful in restoring the identities of the entire crew. (VOY: "Workforce, Part II")

Life in the Alpha Quadrant
Seven with Icheb in 2386
Sometime after Voyager returned from the Delta Quadrant, Seven joined the Fenris Rangers, a peacekeeping force that operated along the Romulan Neutral Zone, where she worked closely with a woman named Bjayzl. Unbeknownst to Seven, however, Bjayzl was a black market dealer in Borg parts taken from former drones, also known as "xBs", and had infiltrated the Rangers to get close to Seven. It was through Seven that Bjayzl learned about Icheb, by this time a Starfleet lieutenant assigned as a science officer aboard the USS Coleman. In 2386, Bjayzl lured Icheb into an ambush while he was on a reconnaissance mission for the Rangers near Daimanta. She arranged for him to be taken to the Seven Domes facility on Vergessen, where his implants were brutally removed from him without any anesthetic, or even the small mercy of death. In anguish, Seven, who considered Icheb as a son since their time on Voyager, arrived to rescue him; but she was too late. In unbearable pain, he entreated Seven to end his life. Cradling him in her arms, she tearfully bid "her child" farewell before she complied by fatally shooting him with her phaser. (PIC: "Stardust City Rag")

Aiding La Sirena
Thirteen years later, Seven assisted La Sirena in battle against a Romulan Bird-of-Prey in orbit of the planet Vashti. Her ship was destroyed, but she was beamed over to La Sirena and was surprised to see Admiral Jean-Luc Picard on board. She quipped that he owed her a ship before she collapsed. (PIC: "Absolute Candor") 

Seven vaporizing Bjayzl
Picard explained that he was on his way to Freecloud to find Dr. Bruce Maddox. Upon learning that he had been captured by Bjayzl, who intended to turn him over to the Tal Shiar, Seven helped plan his rescue by offering herself to Bjayzl in exchange for Maddox. Posing as traders, Picard and La Sirena captain Cristóbal Rios "delivered" Seven to Bjayzl, only for Seven (wearing compromised binders) to "break free", revealing her true intentions: to kill Bjayzl in revenge for Icheb's death. Picard was seemingly able to talk her out of murdering Bjayzl and returning with him and his crew to La Sirena. After Maddox was rescued, Seven declined Picard's offer of a ride, saying the Rangers were sending a corsair to Freecloud to pick her up, but did take two type 3 phasers from La Sirena's armory. Before beaming back to Freecloud, Seven asked Picard about whether he had rediscovered his humanity after he was rescued from the Borg, and admitted she was still working to find hers "every damn day" of her life. Picard understood this, as he was wrestling with the same. The two amicably parted ways. 

However, far from the impression she had given Picard, Seven still intended to kill Bjayzl. She transported into Bjayzl’s nightclub and confronted the criminal businesswoman after clearing out the lounge by shooting her bodyguards, causing all others present to flee, leaving Bjayzl alone. Bjayzl tried to stall until her security arrived, but Seven knew what she was trying to do, and sardonically told her so. Bjayzl then began trying to talk Seven out of killing her, but Seven coldly cut her off with raised rifles and a bitter retort that Icheb had been a son to her. She then vaporized Bjayzl with shots from both rifles. Seconds later, Bjayzl’s security team arrived, and Seven furiously carved a path through them with the rifles. (PIC: "Stardust City Rag")

Seven acting as "Queen" aboard the Artifact
After Freecloud, Seven was summoned by a communications chip she had given to fellow xB Hugh, the director of the Borg Reclamation Project aboard the "Artifact" in Romulan space. After Hugh was killed by the Romulans, Elnor - who had remained behind while Picard and Soji Asha had used the spatial trajector in the cube's queencell to escape - used the communicator to call Seven to the cube in order to take control of it. Seven accessed the queencell to begin regenerating the damage done to the cube. When the Romulans began venting the stasis-contained drones into space and killing the xBs, Seven decided to link the transceivers of the disconnected Borg on the cube into a "mini-collective", with herself acting as a sort of Borg Queen, despite her reluctance to essentially assimilate them all over again. The Romulans left the Artifact with their fleet to invade the Synthetic homeworld Coppelius, leaving the cube in the control of Seven and the xBs. When Elnor asked if Seven intended to assimilate him now, the cube's collective said only that "Annika still has work to do" before Seven was disconnected from the queencell. While connected to the Queencell, however, Seven witnessed La Sirena being pursued by Narek, prompting her to open a transwarp conduit to follow them to Coppelius. (PIC: "Nepenthe", "Broken Pieces", "Et in Arcadia Ego, Part 1") 

The Artifact crashed on the surface, where she reunited with Picard and La Sirena's crew. Here, Elnor decided to stay with Seven as part of her effort to reactivate the Artifact's defenses and aid the xBs. Seven told Picard to "keep saving the galaxy", but Picard replied that it was all on her now. (PIC: "Et in Arcadia Ego, Part 1")

Personal development
Seven in 2378
Although she began to accept her Humanity, Seven was still not completely eager to return to the Alpha Quadrant, and became apprehensive when opportunities presented themselves. (VOY: "Hope and Fear") Her reluctance actually proved lifesaving for the Voyager crew in 2375 when the ship was nearly ingested by a bioplasmic organism known as the telepathic pitcher plant. She was one of only three crew members (the others being Naomi Wildman – who, like Seven, had no emotional links to Earth and the Alpha Quadrant – and The Doctor, who was unaffected due to his inorganic nature) not affected by its illusion of a wormhole back to the Alpha Quadrant. Despite the crew's attempts to place her into stasis, she was able to join forces with The Doctor and an alien named Qatai to free Voyager. (VOY: "Bliss") Like many Borg drones separated from the Collective, Seven suffered a degree of eremophobia (a fear of being alone), which she was forced to face when piloting Voyager through an area of space riddled with subnucleonic radiation while the crew was placed in stasis for the duration. (VOY: "One")

At first, Seven found holodecks a pointless endeavor, fulfilling a Human desire to fantasize which she did not share. (VOY: "One") She reluctantly took part in Janeway's Leonardo da Vinci simulation, but believed it to be a waste of time. (VOY: "The Raven") Later, however, she visited many of Tom Paris' programs, including The Adventures of Captain Proton in which she played Constance Goodheart to Paris' Captain Proton. She still saw the program as frivolous, and quickly disabled Satan's Robot instead of playing along with the storyline of the program. (VOY: "Night") In 2376, she visited the Fair Haven program. By this time, she engaged the holographic characters in conversation and participated in the fantasy. (VOY: "Fair Haven") She and The Doctor attended a screening of Attack of the Lobster People in a recreation of the Palace Theater in 2377. (VOY: "Repression") By 2378, Seven created a holographic simulation of Voyager in order to improve her social abilities. In the program, her Borg implants had been permanently removed, and she was given a Starfleet science uniform and crew quarters. She also explored a romantic relationship with Chakotay while running the program. She began to use the program excessively, interfering with her duties. (VOY: "Human Error")

Relationships
Initially, after her release from the Collective, Seven retained much of her former drone personality. She was harsh towards the rest of the crew and often disobeyed Captain Janeway's orders when she felt they were incorrect. However, as time went on she gradually formed a close bond with the others, especially with The Doctor, Tuvok, and Janeway herself. (VOY: "The Gift")

During her time with the Borg, Seven became used to the billions of voices that made up the Collective. After she was separated from them, she found solitude distressing. It became more apparent when Seven was left with The Doctor to watch over Voyager as it went through a radioactive Mutara class nebula. When The Doctor's program went off-line, she was alone in command of Voyager. Her implants began malfunctioning, and she saw convincing hallucinations of an alien named Trajis Lo-Tarik and the Voyager crew, seriously injured by the effects of the nebula. She was able to ignore the illusions and eventually save the Voyager crew after the ship's systems began to malfunction as a result of the nebula's radiation. After this experience, Seven joined a group in the mess hall for the first time. (VOY: "One")

Family
Seven's parents, Erin and Magnus Hansen
Seven's aunt, Irene Hansen
Seven began to read her parents' journals from their mission aboard the Raven, as these were her only link to her parents. She encountered the drone which was originally her father while held captive by the Borg in 2375. He most likely was destroyed along with the Borg Queen's vessel. (VOY: "Dark Frontier")

She had an ancestor, Sven "Buttercup" Hansen, who was a 22nd century prize boxer. (VOY: "11:59")

Seven was present for some of the conversations the Voyager crew had with families after two-way communication was established in 2378. She was reluctant to contact her aunt, Irene Hansen, but the experiences of the crew convinced her it would be worthwhile. Irene was overjoyed to speak with her, but Seven was slightly uncomfortable when Irene used her real name, Annika. (VOY: "Author, Author")

Seven also had a "son". A transporter accident involving The Doctor's mobile emitter and Seven's nanoprobes resulted in the creation of a Borg drone, One. At first she was reluctant to teach the drone about individuality and life on Voyager, but she eventually became attached to him, almost maternally. When One decided to allow himself to die for the benefit of the crew, Seven was deeply upset. (VOY: "Drone")

Friendships
While under the influence of synthehol, Seven told The Doctor and several other Voyager crew that she considered them all "very good friends." (VOY: "Timeless")

Kathryn Janeway
Janeway tries to help Seven remember her life before being assimilated
Captain Janeway made the decision to sever Seven of Nine from the Collective. She helped her through the difficult transition to Humanity in 2374, trying to force memories of her life as Annika Hansen to surface. (VOY: "The Gift") Janeway also tried to tutor Seven in the arts and further cultivate her Humanity. (VOY: "The Raven") Seven was not hesitant to question Captain Janeway's decisions, sometimes publicly. She thought Janeway placed the crew in unnecessary danger by exploring the Delta Quadrant and contacting civilizations such as the Mari, rather than setting a course for home. (VOY: "Random Thoughts")

When Voyager believed that Starfleet had sent the USS Dauntless to bring the crew home in late 2374, Seven did not want to return with the crew. She requested to remain in the Delta Quadrant, possibly returning to the Borg Collective. Janeway was dismayed that Seven had not found an appreciation for her new life in the year she spent aboard Voyager. Later, the ship was found to be a fake created by Arturis in order to deliver the Voyager crew to the Borg. While trapped aboard the ship, Seven confessed to Captain Janeway that she was thankful for her individuality and was not eager to return to the Collective. She also confessed that it was fear of the unknown, that is, what will happen after she returns to Earth, that discouraged her from going back. (VOY: "Hope and Fear")

In 2375, Seven inadvertently helped The Doctor recover memories of Ensign Ahni Jetal, erased from his database when they caused problems with his ethical subroutines. Captain Janeway intended to erase the memories once again, but Seven voiced concern. She felt that erasing The Doctor's memories would essentially mean turning a blind eye to his development as an individual. Seven admitted that she saw Janeway as a role model, but began to question that image after her treatment of The Doctor. This gave Janeway more to think about, and she decided to restore the memories to The Doctor. (VOY: "Latent Image")

Seven of Nine often had the ear of the captain, coming to her whenever she needed moral guidance, or wanted to express something she had learned about Humanity. One such occasion occurred in 2378, when Seven dropped a barrier protecting the Ventu from cultural contamination. Before making any command decisions, Janeway asked Seven what she thought of the Ventu; Seven found them antiquated, but resourceful. She believed that if the Ledosians were allowed to contaminate them more, "something unique would be lost." (VOY: "Natural Law")

In an alternate timeline, Seven of Nine was fatally wounded on an away mission and died upon her return to Voyager. Her death deeply affected the Janeway of that time. (VOY: "Endgame")

B'Elanna Torres
Voyager engineer B'Elanna Torres was distrustful of Seven, and the two almost came to blows several times during Seven's early days on Voyager. Torres was stunned that Seven experienced no remorse over the fate of civilizations such as the Caatati, devastated by the Borg. (VOY: "Day of Honor") Torres believed Seven was cold, rude, and acted like the crew of Voyager were Borg drones. She told Chakotay that she did not want to be held responsible if she and Seven got into a physical altercation. Chakotay, in turn, put Torres' own attitude in check when he made it clear that she needed to find a way to work with Seven and that she would be held responsible if a fight occurred. Seven earned some of Torres' respect when she used a feedback pulse to disable a Hirogen who threatened the ship's use of the communications network in 2374 (although she made sure the disapproving Janeway was out of earshot first). (VOY: "Message in a Bottle") Seven studied Torres and future husband Tom Paris during their courtship, even noting the times when the two had sexual relations. Upon discovering this in 2375, Torres was quite incensed. (VOY: "Someone to Watch Over Me")

While the two women would never become close friends, they did develop a good working relationship as time passed. By 2377, the two had grown more comfortable with each other. Torres comforted Seven when she was faced with death after her cortical node malfunctioned, telling her that she made valuable contributions to the crew of Voyager. (VOY: "Imperfection")  Torres talked to Seven about Paris shortly before their marriage in 2377. Seven suggested that Torres try to participate in some of Paris' interests in order to improve their relationship, which led to Torres' participation in the Antarian Trans-stellar Rally. (VOY: "Drive") To Torres' shock, Seven presented her with a baby shower present and complimented her on her hair the following year. (VOY: "Human Error")

Naomi Wildman
Naomi Wildman
Naomi Wildman was the first child born aboard Voyager. She was initially scared of Seven and afraid that she could assimilate her. Soon, she became fascinated with Seven, and began following her in early 2375. Seven was initially annoyed with her, and disapproved of Naomi's study of Borg species designations. While Seven was experiencing problems due to contact with the infected vinculum, one of the personalities to emerge was that of a small child. She played kadis-kot with Naomi, to Naomi's delight. After the crisis was resolved, Seven decided to instruct Naomi in astrometrics, giving her several star charts and species information to study. Seven also requested a game of kadis-kot with Naomi. (VOY: "Infinite Regress") They became friends, going to lunch or playing games of kadis-kot. They had in common that they often couldn't understand the crew's determination to return to Earth. This fact proved helpful when Voyager was confronted by the telepathic pitcher plant, which made the rest of the crew see it as a wormhole to Earth. Seven and Naomi were unaffected due to their indifference about returning home and, aided by Qatai, who had hunted the creature for years, and The Doctor, they were able to trick the creature into expelling Voyager. (VOY: "Bliss") When Seven was kidnapped by the Borg, Naomi demonstrated her determination to save Seven, and presented to Captain Janeway a plan to rescue Seven. (VOY: "Dark Frontier") Seven once stated that she thought of Naomi as her family on board Voyager. (VOY: "Survival Instinct", "The Voyager Conspiracy")

Tuvok
Tuvok became friends with Seven of Nine, when he witnessed her ordeal as she gradually had to remember her assimilation by the Borg. He helped her manage it and Seven opened up to him. (VOY: "The Raven") After that, she began having conversations with Tuvok and it became apparent she enjoyed talking with him because of his logic and distant way of seeing things, which was similar to her own. Tuvok also had a similar attitude towards Seven. (VOY: "Mortal Coil")  

Tuvok was quick to compliment Seven when she quickly learned and won a game of Kal-toh. (VOY: "The Omega Directive")

Both Tuvok and Seven of Nine often preferred completing away missions in silence. After working together and Seven saving Tuvok's life, he was able to help her cope with the difficult mission they shared. (VOY: "Tsunkatse") In time they also started appreciating each other, because of them being outsiders on the ship.(VOY: "Human Error")

Surrogate motherhood
Seven interacts with the Borg children
In 2376, Seven became a temporary mother figure to a group of children whom Voyager had discovered aboard a derelict Borg vessel. She cared for the children, named Icheb, Mezoti, Rebi, and Azan, until the latter three were returned to their own people in 2377. (VOY: "Collective", "Child's Play", "Imperfection")  Seven was frustrated with her initial attempts to tutor the children. She designed a rigid schedule for their activities, enacting serious punishment when they failed to adhere to the schedule. They rebelled against the restrictions, and an exasperated Seven told Chakotay she no longer wished to supervise them. He made her realize that while consistency is important, children also need spontaneity. Her efforts were much more successful once she made allowances for that. (VOY: "Ashes to Ashes")

Icheb
After discovering that he had been genetically engineered as a weapon against the Borg, the eldest of the children, Icheb, remained with Voyager and he and Seven formed a close relationship. (VOY: "Child's Play") Icheb expressed a desire to apply for Starfleet Academy admission, and hoped Seven would speak to the captain about having Commander Tuvok teach him preliminary courses. Around this time, Icheb donated his own cortical node when the failure of Seven's jeopardized her life. She initially refused to accept his help, placing his safety above her own despite his research showing that he was far more likely to survive the loss of the node than she was. (VOY: "Imperfection")

Eight years after Voyager returned to Earth, Icheb was captured by Bjayzl, who had hired surgeons to brutally and painfully extract his Borg implants for her to sell on the black market. Seven attempted to rescue Icheb, whom she considered to be like a son to her, but arrived too late to save his life. Mortally wounded and in excruciating pain, Icheb begged Seven to quickly kill him, which she did by shooting him with a phaser at point-blank range.

Thirteen years later, Seven caught up with Bjayzl and executed her in retribution for Icheb's death. (PIC: "Stardust City Rag")

Romance
Harry Kim became physically attracted to Seven shortly after she joined Voyager. Noticing this, she addressed the situation with him, asking him if he desired to "copulate", thereby embarrassing him. However, she did tell Kim late at night in the mess hall that she was willing to explore her sexuality and told him to take his clothes off. (VOY: "Revulsion") The attraction was also painfully obvious to the rest of the Voyager crew. (VOY: "Revulsion", "Hunters")  She seduced him in a dream caused by aliens encountered in 2374. (VOY: "Waking Moments")

Under The Doctor's tutelage, Seven first explored true romance in 2375. She chose engineering crew member William Chapman after determining that their interests were compatible. However, Seven's directness was too overbearing for Chapman, and the date ended up in disaster when Seven accidentally tore a ligament in his shoulder while dancing. (VOY: "Someone to Watch Over Me")

In 2378, Seven was distressed to discover that the Borg had deliberately programmed the cortical implant of their drones to shut down in the event that the drone began to experience strong emotion, thus killing the drone. The Doctor believed he could reprogram the affected implant, but Seven refused treatment. Later that year, she changed her mind, and she underwent the surgery. (VOY: "Human Error", "Endgame")

Axum
While Seven was assisting the drones of Unimatrix Zero, she mainly dealt with a man named Axum, with whom she had had a romantic relationship within Unimatrix Zero while she was still a drone. The relationship sparked again, strengthening her resolve to help those within the Unimatrix. However, Axum was physically aboard a scout vessel at the border of fluidic space in a remote sector of the Beta Quadrant, making it impossible to contact him again once Unimatrix Zero was destroyed. (VOY: "Unimatrix Zero", "Unimatrix Zero, Part II")
