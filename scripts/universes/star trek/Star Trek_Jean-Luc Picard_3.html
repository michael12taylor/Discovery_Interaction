<html><p>In 2370, Lieutenant Worf encountered a quantum fissure which caused him to begin shifting between quantum realities. In several universes, Picard was still captain of the Enterprise and attended a surprise birthday party for Worf, though his services were stated to be required on the bridge. In the final universe in which Worf arrived, William Riker was the captain, as Picard was lost in the Borg encounter of 2367. In another reality, the Borg had invaded the Federation and the Enterprise was one of the few ships left. Worf was finally returned to his own quantum reality and the quantum fissure was sealed. (TNG: "Parallels")
Picard in an alternate timeline
In 2370, while standing trial by Q, Picard's consciousness was shifting between three alternate timelines. In an alternate 2364, Picard disobeyed Starfleet orders from the moment he arrived on board the Enterprise at Earth Station McKinley. He called a red alert while docked at the station, ordered the ship to the Devron system instead of to Farpoint Station and took the vessel into a temporal anomaly there. In an alternate 2370, Picard was diagnosed with Irumodic Syndrome by Dr. Crusher. This caused her to reconsider her relationship with Picard, and she reversed her earlier decision to remain just friends. The Enterprise was dispatched to the Devron system near the Romulan Neutral Zone where it discovered the temporal anomaly. In an unknown, alternate future timeframe, Picard found himself at his family's vineyard with Geordi La Forge. Picard contacted Riker, now an admiral and commanding officer of Starbase 247, for help in investigating the anomaly, but Riker refused to allow him passage to the Neutral Zone, thinking Picard had been affected by his Irumodic Syndrome and was delusional. Later, Picard convinced his ex-wife, Beverly Picard, to take her medical ship, the USS Pasteur, to investigate the anomaly. The Pasteur was attacked and destroyed by Klingon battleships, but the Enterprise, under command of Admiral Riker, arrived to rescue the crew and fight off the Klingons. Picard once again pleaded with Riker to return to the Devron system, but he was then sedated and returned to quarters. Armed with new information gathered from the other two timeframes, Picard woke and went to talk to Riker and the other former Enterprise officers, and convinced them that the anomaly existed. The Enterprise returned just in time to watch it form, and Riker ordered the Enterprise into the anomaly, where it used a static warp shell in concert with the other Enterprises to collapse it. After the anomaly was sealed, the timelines were erased, and only Picard retained memory of those events. He told his staff of his experiences in the future, in hopes that things such as the conflict between Worf and Riker that followed Deanna Troi's death never happen. (TNG: "All Good Things...")
Picard was briefly trapped in the Nexus during a mission to stop renegade El-Aurian scientist Dr. Tolian Soran from destroying the Veridian system. In the perfect world in the Nexus, his nephew René (who had recently died in a fire) was still alive, and he had a wife and four children. Realizing that it wasn't real, he rejected the reality offered to him and left the Nexus to defeat Soran with the aid of Captain James T. Kirk. (Star Trek Generations)
Holograms
Picard as an Admiral in Barash's holoprogram
As part of Reginald Barclay's holo-addiction, he had created at least two programs that had recreations of Jean-Luc. One was a recreation of the Enterprise-D, the other, Barclay Program 15, had Picard as one of The Three Musketeers. (TNG: "Hollow Pursuits")
A Jean-Luc Picard hologram was in Barash's holoprogram, this future Picard was a full admiral. (TNG: "Future Imperfect")

Reminiscences
In 2369, after Vash arrived on Deep Space 9, Miles O'Brien told Benjamin Sisko about her relationship with Picard, explaining "Well sir, Vash and Captain Picard were friends. Close friends, if you follow my meaning." While Sisko replied "Somehow she doesn't seem to be his type," O'Brien thought it was because Picard "likes a good challenge." 

Later when Q saw Vash working over Quark, he described her actions as "perfectly vile," adding "If that's the kind of company you kept before meeting me, it's no wonder you ended up with Picard." 

Later yet, when Q placed Sisko in a boxing match, he was shocked after Sisko knocked him to the ground. "You hit me… Picard never hit me!", to which Sisko shot back, "I'm not Picard!" 

Finally, when the crew of the station could not tie the odd happening on the station to one of the artifacts Vash had brought aboard, Q appeared before the senior staff and claimed how "Picard and his lackeys would have solved all this technobabble hours ago," before directing to Sisko, that it was "No wonder you're not commanding a starship." (DS9: "Q-Less")

In 2372, Worf and Miles O'Brien reminisced in Quark's about rescuing Picard from the Borg Collective. (DS9: "The Way of the Warrior")

Later that year, after a member of the Q Continuum arrived on her ship seeking asylum, Kathryn Janeway automatically assumed he was Picard's Q – which instead made him nervous and agitated. When that Q, tasked with capturing the renegade, appeared on the bridge, she realized that he was the being she'd heard so much about, he laughed and asked her, "Has Jean-Luc been whispering about me behind my back?" (VOY: "Death Wish")

In her effort to look through every log entry of Starfleet captains who had contact with the Borg, Captain Janeway cited Picard's words among others: "In their collective state, the Borg are utterly without mercy – driven by one will alone, the will to conquer. They are beyond redemption, beyond reason", with Chakotay claiming that she had unknowingly mimicked Picard's vocal mannerisms while quoting him. (VOY: "Scorpion")

According to Valerie Archer, while discussing Boothby to Chakotay, "Half the captains in Starfleet wouldn't be where they are today if it weren't for Boothby," including Picard. (VOY: "In the Flesh")

In 2375, Ensign Nog mentioned Al Lorenzo having a curious interest in taking holophotos of himself sitting behind the desks of famous Starfleet captains. Usually, he would sneak into their offices, but the Dominion War made it difficult for him to get away. Among the photos in his collection included Lorenzo sitting behind the desks of such famous commanders as Robert DeSoto and Jean-Luc Picard. (DS9: "Treachery, Faith and the Great River")

Q mentioned "Jean-Luc" as another option for helping to raise his son to the satisfaction of the Q Continuum. He wondered aloud if it was not too late to ask Picard instead of Janeway. (VOY: "Q2")

Quotes about Picard
"…the heart of an explorer, and the soul of a poet."

"You know, I never thought I would say this, but it's good to see you again. It brings a sense of order and stability to my universe to know that you're still a pompous ass. And a damn sexy man."

"I've never known anyone with more drive, determination or more courage than Jean-Luc Picard."

"I had such high hopes for you, Picard. I thought you were a bit more evolved than the rest of your species. But now I realize you're just as weak as all the others. Still, it pains me to see the great Jean-Luc Picard brought down by a woman."

"Jean-Luc, I never knew you were such a cad. I'm impressed."

"Really, Vash, I can't believe you're still pining for Jean-Luc, that self righteous do-gooder." 

"Actually, what I was hoping for was a little witty repartee, but I see I'm not going to get any of that either. At least your beloved Jean-Luc knows how to turn a phrase…"

"You know Picard. Every part of that guy that's not ego is rampaging id."

Background information
Patrick Stewart wears a hairpiece during a flashback sequence from "Violations"
Patrick Stewart during the filming of Star Trek Nemesis, with Director Stuart Baird
Picard was played by Patrick Stewart in all of the character's television and film appearances. David Tristan Birkin played Picard as a child in TNG: "Rascals", while Marcus Nash appeared as Picard as a young ensign in "Tapestry". Tom Hardy was seen as Cadet Picard in a photograph in Star Trek Nemesis; Hardy also played Picard's clone, Shinzon, in the same film.

According to the Star Trek Encyclopedia (4th ed., vol. 2, p. 145), Robert Justman said that Picard was named after oceanographer Jacques Piccard.

According to the Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (2nd ed., p. 13) the original casting call sent out to agents asked for the following:

"CAPT. Julien Picard – A Caucasian man in his 50s who is very youthful and in prime physical condition. Born in Paris, his Gallic accent appears when deep emotions are triggered. He is definitely a 'romantic' and believes strongly in concepts like honor and duty. Capt. Picard commands the Enterprise. He should have a mid-Atlantic accent, and a wonderfully rich speaking voice."
The character of Picard changed quite a bit from the March 1987 version of the Writers/Directors Guide. In that guide, he was born in Paris, carried a touch of French phrasing in his speech, and pretended that France is "the only true civilization" on Earth (reminiscent of Pavel Chekov).

In 1986, D.C. Fontana made an attempt to recruit actor Stephen Macht for the role. "She called me in 1986 and said she wanted me to come in and meet Gene Roddenberry," said Macht. "She told me he was the writer of Star Trek and she wanted him to meet me. So I went in, I sit down opposite him in his office, and D.C. was with me. He said, 'D.C. has brought me clips of everything you've done since you've been in Hollywood. You are my next Star Trek hero, Picard.' And I'm full of piss and vinegar at that time. I was forty-two and doing well. I said to him, 'I've seen these things, and I don't want to do them. I don't want to speak to guys with six heads for the rest of my life.' He said, 'It's not about that, Stephen. They're morality tales. I want you to do it. You just have to come read for the studio head.' 'I don't want to read. You want me to do it? Offer it to me. You know who my agent is.'" (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 92)

Also considered for the role of Picard were Louis Gossett, Jr., Yaphet Kotto, James Earl Jones, Billy Dee Williams, Avery Brooks, and Keir Dullea. By 9 April 1987, a meeting between the studio and Kotto was scheduled (with no audition to be held) on 14 April 1987. On or shortly before 9 April, Kotto's agent called TNG Casting Director Junie Lowry, suggesting Kotto would fly down only if Paramount paid to have him flown down, and that Kotto would prefer to take Gene Roddenberry for lunch rather than having a meeting. Lowry replied that a meeting would be preferable to everyone at the studio, owing to all the busy schedules involved, and notified the agent that Kotto would be meeting not only Roddenberry but also both producers and Jeff Hayes. She also said it was unlikely that the studio would pay to fly Kotto in for a meeting, to which the agent quickly began to concede on that point. He then enquired as to how serious the studio's interest was in casting Kotto, a question already asked. Lowry answered that, if the studio decided to go for a black captain as the series lead, Kotto was under extremely serious consideration. The meeting remained scheduled, and Lowry included a written account of the phone call in a casting availability update memo she sent to "all concerned" on 9 April 1987. In the memo, she listed Gossett, Kotto, and Williams as being available, whereas Jones and Brooks were noted as unavailable. As noted in the same document, Gossett's agent doubted, however, that Gossett would be interested, and a VHS tape of Dullea was meanwhile being shot in New York. The casting notes also mentioned Stephen Macht, without specifying the role he was being considered for, though the memo did state, "He is certainly very interested."

Robert Justman was instrumental in the casting of Picard. Patrick Stewart was discovered by Justman and his wife when pre-production work for the then-forthcoming Star Trek series had been taking place at Paramount for about a month or two. The event occurred one night while Stewart was giving a dramatic reading at the University of California at Los Angeles, as part of a UCLA extension course on humor which Justman and his wife were taking. That night, Stewart was one of two speakers reading from Shakespearean comedies and Noël Coward. While Justman sat with his wife and watched the readings, he thought Stewart looked familiar, but couldn't quite place him. "Patrick sat down, pushed up his jacket sleeves to display his massive forearms, and commenced to read," Justman reflected. "He spoke a few sentences and I was thunderstruck. I turned to my wife, Jackie, and I said, 'I think I found our new captain!'" Justman was so impressed by Stewart's performance that night that, the next day, he called the Screen Actor's Guild and determined who Stewart's agent was in Los Angeles, because the actor was living in London and was temporarily in America just to perform the reading at UCLA. Contacting the agent, Justman arranged for Stewart to meet with Gene Roddenberry and Justman himself at Roddenberry's house the following Monday. "Patrick came in his rental car, and we sat around for thirty-forty minutes," Justman continued, "and then he made his good-byes and left to fly back to England. After he drove away, Gene closed the door and turned to me, and I will quote him exactly. He said, 'I won't have him.'" Roddenberry himself noted, "My first reaction was, 'Jesus Christ, Bob, I don't want a bald man.'" (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, pp. 89-90 & 91)

As of 13 April 1987, the performers who were being considered to play Picard included Mitch Ryan, Roy Thinnes, Yaphet Kotto, and Patrick Bauchau. On that day Bauchau successfully auditioned for Gene Roddenberry; the "favorites" for the part were meanwhile regarded as Bauchau as well as Patrick Stewart, with the other three performers scheduled to start auditioning the following week. These developments were included in a general TNG casting memo from John Ferraro to John Pike (also forwarded to Jeff Hayes), sent the same day as Bachau's audition – 13 April 1987. 

Another memo sent on that date specifically pertained to the casting of Picard, and was from Junie Lowry to, again, "all concerned." It noted about Yaphet Kotto that, although he was available for the part, the studio was still waiting to find out if he would fly down or would only send a tape of himself. The same memo listed Keir Dullea, John Saxon, George Hearn, Lee Van Cleef, Andrew Duggan, John McMartin, Theodore Bikel, Thomas Hill, Edward Mulhare, Dick Shawn, James Olson, Don Ameche, James Gammon, Telly Savalas, and Billy Dee Williams as all being available for the part. Both Mulhare and Savalas were noted as actually being interested in it, too. However, both Dullea and McMartin were in New York, and the studio was yet to receive a tape from Dullea, who refused to audition for the role without a test option agreement first being arranged. Hearn and Williams weren't interested (in Williams' case, his disinterest was because the series would be syndicated), and Hill would only be available after 24 April. Anthony Quayle was listed as possibly being interested, though he was currently in London. Performers who, despite having been considered, were listed as not available included Paul Gleason, Noble Willingham, Moses Gunn, William Devane, John Hillerman, Robert Hogan, Fred Gwynne, Dana Elcar, Peter Donat, and Peter Michael Goetz. Listed as uninterested were George Grizzard, Rip Torn, and Scott Glenn (Torn wasn't interested in doing any TV at that point in his career). 

Shortly after Robert Justman discovered Patrick Stewart, Rick Berman met Stewart. Like Justman, Berman was impressed, so he advised Justman that they needed to persuade Roddenberry to cast Stewart as Picard. "Bob said to me, 'We can't. When Gene makes up his mind, it's a waste of time to try and change it,'" Berman recounted. "But in my case, ignorance was bliss. I didn't believe that." Justman himself stated about Roddenberry, "No matter what I said, he was adamant, and the reason was because the character he had created in his own mind was a very hairy Frenchman, so we embarked upon a campaign that lasted for some months, and when Rick Berman came on the show and became supervising producer with me, Rick jumped all over it, too, and said, 'He's perfect!'" Berman characterized himself as "the guy who basically bugged Gene into realizing that Patrick was the best Picard." Roddenberry recalled, "In his wisdom, Justman kept his mouth shut and let me grow accustomed to him." Said Justman, "Our casting director was for it, everyone was for it, except Gene. We went through everybody in town and in foreign countries trying to find the right person to play the captain, and couldn't. Finally, our last candidate came in, read for us and left, and we were sitting there – the casting director, Rick, Gene, and myself – and he finally turned around and looked at us and said, 'All right, I'll go with Patrick,' and that was it. It was so right, I've never been more sure of anything in my life, at least in the business, than casting Patrick in that role. He was everything that a captain ought to be." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, pp. 90 & 91)

At first, Gene Roddenberry's acceptance of Patrick Stewart as Picard was conditional. "He said, 'But when we bring him to the studio for the final audition, I want him to wear a wig, because I don't want this guy going in bald,'" Rick Berman remembered. Via phone call to London, Stewart had a wig made by one of the most well-renowned theatrical wig makers in England, then had the wig dispatched to America. When TNG Supervising Producer David Livingston first met Stewart, the actor visited Livingston's trailer (where Livingston was otherwise alone) with a box of wigs, and asked where he could find the make-up and hair staff, as the production crew wanted to see what he looked like with the wigs on. Stewart eventually found someone who helped him put on the wig. He then auditioned for John Pike, who was well aware that Stewart was really bald. "He had seen all the photographs of him, and we had played him a tape of Patrick's clips," Berman noted. (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, pp. 91-92)

By this time, the only remaining contender for the part, according to Rick Berman, was Stephen Macht. Like Stewart, he also auditioned for John Pike. Despite regarding Macht as "a very good actor," Berman believed he wasn't anywhere near as suitable for the role as Patrick Stewart was. Years later, Macht admitted that, at that point in his life, he hadn't been prepared to play such a major role, partly because he had been too young and egotistical, and partly because he had been uninterested in doing a series. "I just was not ready," he declared. "I would be now, but I wasn't then. In the intervening years, of course, after so much experience, I found that there are so many layers to who I am that I can reveal slowly and that would have made a TV series like The Next Generation more appealing. Looking back at it, I thank Dorothy and Gene for a marker in my life that I can really think about in terms of seeing what the trajectory has been over a whole period of years […] Had I known then what I know now, I would have knocked the shit out of that role." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 92)

Ultimately, John Pike opted for Patrick Stewart rather than Stephen Macht. Pike did so with one extra piece of advice: that Stewart "lose the wig." Remarked Berman, "That was the best three words we could have heard." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 92) In a one-line memo Helen Mossler sent Gene Roddenberry on 1 May 1987, Mossler announced, "Patrick Stewart's deal has been finalized and has been sent to his agent for his signature." 

Picard was originally intended to be in his early fifties, with a twenty-two-year stint captaining the Stargazer (citation needed • edit); Stewart himself was forty-seven in 1987. The show established a long gap between the Stargazer and the Enterprise-D; the Okuda timeline states he was 59 in TNG Season 1 (and thus is 74 in Star Trek Nemesis, compared to Stewart having been 62 when that film was made). (citation needed • edit) Similarly, although Stewart was 79 when he filmed the first season of Star Trek: Picard, set in 2399, Picard is 94.

When Patrick Stewart accepted the offer to play Picard, a friend of his asked him what he thought it would feel like to portray "an American icon." At the time, that prospect made Stewart feel uneasy. (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 93)

During an interview with Michael Parkinson, Patrick Stewart related how, in his first press conference for The Next Generation, a reporter asked Gene Roddenberry how Captain Picard could be bald, figuring that baldness would surely be cured by the 24th century. Roddenberry replied, "By the 24th century, no one will care." 

In a 2014 appearance on NPR's quiz show Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!, Patrick Stewart indicated that the real life reason for Picard lacking a French accent was that it sounded silly when he attempted it:

Patrick Stewart was, though, fascinated with attempting to assert strength in his portrayal of Picard. "It was always important to me to try and establish and affirm the quiet, but absolute authority he has on the ship," said Stewart, "and that seemed to be successful." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 94)

Picard was irrevocably altered by his ordeal as Locutus, in "The Best of Both Worlds" and "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II". "Picard became more Human than ever before," commented writer Michael Piller. "He was the indestructible captain, untouchable, above all risk and danger, and suddenly, in this two-parter, he is a man who's been raped by the Borg and has to deal emotionally with huge consequences […] And after that, Picard was more complex, never the same; he was a far more interesting character after that." (Mission Overview, TNG Season 4 DVD special feature) Ira Steven Behr agreed that temporarily having Picard, "who, compared to Kirk, was an administrator more than an adventurer," be transformed into a Borg "kind of gave his humanity back to him" and was a "genius" idea. Patrick Stewart concurred, "Making the man more human and vulnerable and prone to error and mistake was a great decision." (William Shatner Presents: Chaos on the Bridge)

David Livingston, who directed the TNG episodes "The Mind's Eye" and "Power Play", found it was relatively very easy to direct Patrick Stewart's characterization of Picard. "The only run-in I ever had with him, I was on the set as a producer and I thought I heard him say a line wrong, and the director said 'cut, print.' I told the director, I think Patrick got that line wrong. Patrick said, 'No, I didn't.' The director said, 'It sounded fine to me.' I had the sound man, Alan Bernard, play back the take, and I was right. They did the line over again, and Patrick said thanks. That was dangerous. I could have kept my mouth shut, but I had a responsibility. That seems like a minor thing, but when you tell Patrick Stewart he went up on a line and nobody else heard it, that's dangerous." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, pp. 94-95)

Trivia
Jean-Luc Picard was the first character to be seen on Star Trek: The Next Generation. Likewise, he was the last person to be seen in the final TNG outing, Star Trek Nemesis.

Other than in alternate timelines, Picard appeared as a captain throughout the entire run of TNG and the subsequent films. Data and Dr. Crusher are the only other characters from TNG to remain at the ranks they started with, though a costuming error in "All Good Things..." has Data wearing the wrong insignia for part of that episode.

Picard is the only character to have appeared in the pilot episodes of three Star Trek series (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint", DS9: "Emissary" and PIC: "Remembrance"). Patrick Stewart is also the first actor seen on screen in each episode, and speaks the first lines in each episode, although in "Emissary" he appears and speaks first as Locutus of Borg.

Apart from James T. Kirk, Picard is the only person to captain two Enterprises, commanding the USS Enterprise-D and the USS Enterprise-E. With the restoration of a cut scene from an extended version of the episode "The Measure Of A Man" (thus making the scene canon), Picard also shares with Pavel Chekov the distinction of having served aboard two starships named Enterprise and one named USS Reliant.

Picard has the distinction of having on-screen dialogue with three of the other main Star Trek captains, the most by any other captain. Picard meets with James T. Kirk in the film Star Trek Generations, Benjamin Sisko in the DS9 pilot "Emissary", and Kathryn Janeway in the film Star Trek Nemesis (although in this last instance, they communicated over a viewscreen without actually meeting face-to-face). He has not had any on-screen dialogue with Jonathan Archer, or with any character from Star Trek: Discovery.

Picard is the only lead character in any Star Trek production who is unambiguously not American. Jonathan Archer was born in upstate New York and raised in San Francisco, California; Christopher Pike was born in Mojave, California; James T. Kirk was from Iowa (his alternate reality counterpart was born in space, but raised in Iowa); Benjamin Sisko was born in New Orleans, Louisiana; and Kathryn Janeway was born in Bloomington, Indiana. Michael Burnham was also born on Earth, and while her nationality hasn't yet been confirmed outright, she speaks with an American accent. 

Picard's sense of French national pride only surfaced briefly in some early episodes, most notably "The Last Outpost". Over the run of TNG, the character adopted several characteristics commonly associated with the English: he enjoys the works of William Shakespeare, and is never seen reading any works of literature by a French author. He drinks Earl Grey tea, an English beverage named after an English nobleman, and is rarely seen drinking wine, a beverage which is commonplace in French life, only drinking it on five occasions, in "Family", again in "First Contact", at the end of Star Trek Nemesis, and in PIC: "Remembrance" and "Nepenthe". Additionally, his father, brother, and nephew all spoke with English accents.

Reception
At least initially, fans of Star Trek: The Original Series responded unfavorably to a new captain of the Enterprise being introduced in TNG. Rick Berman later remembered, "They felt, how can you put a new captain at the seat of the Enterprise? […] And when they heard it was going to be a forty-year-old bald Englishman, they kind of went nuts." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 89) Eventually, the viewers became more accepting towards Picard, much to Patrick Stewart's relief. He commented, "I'm happy that people accepted the captain as a non-American […] They refer to the vivid contrast between the previous captain and myself, not in a competitive way, but in that they are so different there isn't any sense of overlap." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 93) Berman has proclaimed that, ultimately, the fact that Captain Picard was bald was "the greatest sales point for The Next Generation." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 92)

The cast and crew of TNG approved of Patrick Stewart as Picard. Co-Producer Brannon Braga offered, "So much of the success of Next Generation was Patrick Stewart, quite frankly. We always used to say the guy could read a phone book and we'd watch him. He just was so good. I always said a Star Trek series is only as good as its captain, and Picard was pretty fucking great." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 93) David Livingston agreed, "If anyone would captain a starship, it would be [Stewart]. He would never blink. Only when he was off-camera. If you watch him on-camera, I defy you to find a time he was blinking, because of the intensity of his captain […] It was a delight to direct him." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, pp. 92 & 94)

Thomas Dougherty, professor of American Studies at Brandeis University, observed, "Captain Picard – he of the balding dome and clipped accents – blossomed as the unchallenged power, the series' pivotal character and controlling force. Ensemble sensibilities aside, the writing staff conceded the obvious – that a strong central protagonist is as necessary to drive the narrative as command the Enterprise. In Shakesperean actor Patrick Stewart, the new crew found a perfect tribal patriarch. Stewart exudes authority and presence, consistently keeping the proceedings away from Space Patrol kitsch. Even in a dumb costume, declaiming deep-space doubletalk, he brings a kind of Elizabethan stature to his role." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, pp. 93-94)

The infamous Picard facepalm
In recent years, several popular Internet memes have surfaced in connection with Picard, most notably the "Picard facepalm" (originally based on a scene from "Deja Q"), and its numerous derivatives. 

There are a number of musical tributes to Picard, most notably DarkMateria's "Picard Song Tribute"  and Bryan Erickson's "Futile". 

Apocrypha
In the alternate future of the DS9 book series Millennium, Picard was captain of the USS Enterprise-E. He took Ensign Nog under his wing after Nog was assigned to the Enterprise. On stardate 52145.7, Picard attempted to intercept a Dominion warship carrying Weyoun 5. However, Weyoun escaped into the Pah-wraith wormhole. In 2381, the Enterprise was destroyed at the Battle of Rigel VII. According to Thomas Riker, a Starfleet hearing was called, since Picard had lost his third ship (the Stargazer, the Enterprise-D, and the Enterprise-E), but the case was dismissed and Picard was given command of the Enterprise-F in 2383, described as the "first of its class." In 2385, Picard accepted a promotion to admiral, and William T. Riker was given command of the Enterprise. When Earth was destroyed by the Grigari, Picard survived. By 2399, Picard was stricken with Irumodic Syndrome, and would occasionally do such things as speak to nobody (although he claimed to be speaking to Q), or mistake other officers for his old crew (for example, he called Nog "Will" and Jake Sisko "Geordi"). It is implied that he married Beverly Crusher, as he comments to Julian Bashir that, between Bashir and Leonard McCoy, he was always worried that his wife would leave him for one of her heroes. Picard headed up a task force to build a timeship known as the USS Phoenix to try and undo the timeline. However, the Phoenix was destroyed before it could accomplish its mission, but Picard, Nog, and Vash traveled back in time twenty-five thousand years, where they became three Bajoran mystics who wrote prophecies of the events they had experienced; it is also implied that Vash and the elder Picard were married. The entire timeline was later reset thanks to the actions of Benjamin Sisko.

The novel Death in Winter by Michael Jan Friedman told of Picard beginning a romantic relationship with Dr. Beverly Crusher after rescuing her from a planet under Romulan control. A subsequent book, Greater than the Sum, by Christopher L. Bennett, portrayed them as married and expecting a child. The later Paths of Disharmony, by Dayton Ward, shows them with a son, René.

The graphic novel The Gorn Crisis showed Picard undertaking a mission during the Dominion War to make an alliance with the Gorn.

Picard in Star Trek: Countdown
The comic book series Star Trek: Countdown, a tie-in to the 2009 Star Trek film, depicted Picard as having left Starfleet by 2387 to become the Federation Ambassador to Vulcan; with Data, resurrected in B-4's body, succeeding him as captain of the Enterprise-E. When the Enterprise arrived at Vulcan, with the Romulan mining vessel Narada in tow, Picard arranged so that the Vulcan High Council would put aside their prejudices and allow Spock to make his case regarding the Hobus supernova. Despite their best efforts, the Council could not be convinced to give the red matter to the Romulans. After Nero had set off, Hobus erupted with the shock wave of the detonation threatening to destroy Earth and Vulcan in a matter of weeks. After La Forge had been called on and the Jellyfish procured as a vessel to launch the red matter, Picard received several Starfleet reports of ships from all the major galactic powers being destroyed when they neared Romulan space. Suspecting Nero, Picard contacted Worf and requested he intercept the madman with his fleet. When the Jellyfish was ready for launch, Picard boarded the Enterprise to join Worf's fleet. Upon arrival, they found the Narada to have been augmented with Borg technology, the Klingon fleet in pieces and Worf near death. Nero offered to return Worf to them, provided they lowered their shields. Though Picard convinced Data to do so, the Enterprise was crippled as a result, leaving her unable to pursue the Narada. Once repairs were complete, the Enterprise arrived to a collapsing singularity with no sign of Spock or Nero. Concluding that Spock had always known his journey would end like this, Picard led the crew in mourning their departed friend.

Picard's image appeared in the comic book adaptation of the 2009 film as part of a collage from Countdown used to depict Spock's mind-meld with the younger Kirk.

The comic miniseries Star Trek: Spock: Reflections established that after the events of Star Trek Generations, Picard sent a message to Spock explaining how Kirk did not die on the Enterprise-B, but was pulled into the Nexus and how he left it to help Picard defeat Soran from killing two hundred million people in order to re-enter the Nexus and in the process, Kirk was killed while saving Picard and millions of others. Since Kirk was already thought dead, and explaining the nature of the Nexus to Starfleet would be difficult, Picard buried Kirk on Veridian III where he gave his life to save millions. Nonetheless, he felt Spock should know of Kirk's fate. Picard met with Spock a year later at the Kirk family farm in Iowa where he realized Spock had traveled to Veridian III to retrieve Kirk's body and brought him back home to Earth. Spock explained how Kirk did the same for him, at a terrible cost and that he needed to be equal to Kirk's sacrifice. Picard then tells Spock that he would be welcomed to return to Starfleet duty, in any capacity, but Spock planned to return to Romulus to continue his work. Picard asks whether arrangements can be made to make Spock's presence there official, but Spock declined, saying he has always led "a life of solitude and duty". As Spock remembers how he once worked with remarkable friends and comrades, he tells Picard to treasure those times in his own life, since they will someday end. They exchange the Vulcan salute and Picard walks away, but turned back to see Spock still standing quietly by his friend's grave. 

Picard returned in the Star Trek: Ongoing story arc The Q Gambit. Beginning shortly after the events of Countdown, Picard is visited by Q, who informed him that Spock still lived, and that the black hole actually sent him into an alternate reality. When Q attempted to discuss this timeline, Picard cut him off, believing that the various timelines should remain separate from one another. Annoyed, Q reveals he had come for Picard's counsel as Spock had set off a chain of events that would doom that timeline. But since the former captain was uninterested, Q took his leave for the other timeline despite Picard's attempt to call him back. Picard reappeared at the end of the arc where Q returned, now enveloped by the energies of a Prophet. Flatly, Picard said he didn't want to know.

The 3-issue comic miniseries Star Trek: Picard - Countdown, a tie-in to the television series, detailed the efforts of Picard and his first officer, Lt. Cmdr. Raffi Musiker, to aid in the evacuation of Romulan citizens ahead of the impending supernova depicted in Star Trek. In 2381, now promoted to admiral, Picard left the Enterprise to take command of the USS Verity (β) on an envoy mission to offer aid to the empire after Starfleet intercepted communications and learned of the coming catastrophe. Through tense negotiations, Picard convinced the Romulans to allow Starfleet to help evacuate soon-to-be affected worlds, a logistical challenge that he would later compare to the evacuation at Dunkirk during World War II. Picard directed Commander Geordi La Forge to build a specialized fleet at the Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards above Mars to better assist in the relocation. By 2385, a number of worlds had slowly been evacuated. As the first of La Forge's new fleet was near ready to come off the line, the Verity was ordered to to evacuate Romulan colonists from Yuyat Beta, where Picard and Musiker learned of a massive native population the Romulans were prepared to let die. They thwarted a plot by the governor and the Tal Shiar to capture the Verity to use against Starfleet, who they believed was using evacuations as a ruse to sabotage the Romulan Empire. Evacuation of the Romulans and Yuyati proceeded. Picard was introduced to Laris Avem and Zhaban Noctis, two Tal Shiar agents in an illicit love affair who aided in de-escalating the situation. Picard offered them safe haven from retribution on his family's vineyard on Earth.

The alternate future of Star Trek Online established Picard's retirement to private life as occurring in 2402 when he settled in his ancestral home of France.
