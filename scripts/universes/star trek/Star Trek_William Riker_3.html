<html><p>By early 2365, Riker had permanently grown out his beard because he was tired of people always telling him how young he looked. (TNG: "The Neutral Zone", "The Child", "The Pegasus") He also felt the beard was a proud, ancient tradition and a symbol of strength. However, he did not see it as an affectation and was not opposed to shaving it; he had just gotten used to it. (TNG: "The Quality of Life") He briefly shaved it in 2375 after he resumed his relationship with Deanna Troi. (Star Trek: Insurrection)

In Reg Barclay's holofantasies of the Enterprise crew programmed in 2366, Riker was a short toady fellow who followed The Three Musketeers: Picard, Data, and La Forge. Riker was incensed to discover his holosimulation, which Troi believed Reg made short on purpose because Riker's height may have been intimidating. Riker then deleted the character. (TNG: "Hollow Pursuits")

Q "called" Riker to testify during the trial held to determine whether or not the Q later known as Quinn should be allowed to die. The trial was held in 2372 aboard the USS Voyager while it was still lost in the Delta Quadrant, and Q plucked Riker from a time period between 2366 and 2370. Riker explained the significance of a portrait of his ancestor, Thaddius "Iron Boots" Riker, colonel of the 102nd New York Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War, and later realized that Quinn was standing next to Thaddius, as he had saved Thaddius from death during the Battle of Pine Mountain. Q concluded by saying that had Quinn never existed, Q would have lost at least a dozen good opportunities to insult Riker over the years. Riker was then returned to his timeframe without any knowledge of being aboard Voyager. (VOY: "Death Wish")

Background information
Jonathan Frakes goes before the cameras as Riker
Riker was played by Jonathan Frakes in all of the character's film and television appearances. The young Riker seen in photographs, in the episode "The Icarus Factor", was portrayed by an unknown actor.

During the early production stages of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Riker's name was spelled "Ryker". According to Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (2nd ed., p. 13), his description in the original casting call was as follows:

"NUMBER ONE (AKA WILLIAM RYKER) – A 30-35 year old Caucasian born in Alaska. He is a pleasant looking man with sex appeal, of medium height, very agile and strong, a natural psychologist. Number One, as he is usually called, is second in command of the Enterprise and has a very strong, solid relationship with the Captain."
Other background details which were eventually added to Riker's preproduction character bio claimed Riker "doesn't fully appreciate the female need to be needed" and that he is "privately called William by Picard and Bill by 'female friends'" (Troi does refer to him as "Bill" in "The Naked Now" and "Haven", although this nickname was apparently dropped in favor of "Will". However, in the script for "Encounter at Farpoint", Picard refers to him as "Bill".)

The original concept of Will Riker had much in common with the Willard Decker character intended for Star Trek: Phase II; indeed, the background story of the love affair between Riker and Troi is somewhat similar to that of Decker and Ilia as seen in Star Trek: The Motion Picture. (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (2nd ed., p. 66))

Another source of inspiration when fleshing out the character was James T. Kirk. According to the writer's guide for the second season, "Like the legendary 23rd century Kirk (when in his early thirties), our Number One is very strong and agile and has a tendency toward 'derring-do'. Also like Captain Kirk, Riker has a healthy sex drive." (Star Trek: The Next Generation 365, p. 007) Riker was also given the same middle initial T. as Kirk, although his middle name was not actually decided until "Second Chances" in the sixth season. According to Jeri Taylor, a variety of names including "Tecumseh" was considered before the writing staff settled on "Thomas" as the "simplest" choice. (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (2nd ed., pp. 13 & 250))

Prior the the airing of "Second Chances," Peter David's novel Imzadi gave Riker's middle name as "Thelonious" (possibly an allusion to jazz musician Thelonious Monk.) On October 10, 2019, Jonathan Frakes' Twitter post endorsed "Thelonious" as canonical in his own mind.

The preferred spelling of "Will" is not clear; scripts and closed captioning often alternate between "Wil" and "Will".

Among the actors who originally auditioned for the role of William T. Riker were James Horan  , William O. Campbell, Jeffrey Combs, Christopher McDonald, Eric Pierpoint , Erich Anderson, and Vaughn Armstrong (each of whom later played at least one Star Trek role). Campbell was Gene Roddenberry's preference for the role. However, Jeffrey Combs, Ben Murphy, and Michael O'Gorman were also regarded as front runners for the part. In a memo from John E. Ferraro to John Pike, dated 13 April 1987, Frakes, Gregg Marx, Murphy and O'Gorman were named as being considered for the role, with O'Gorman described as a favorite and an atypical but good choice for the role.  Campbell was at one point even cast as Riker. "[John] Pike didn't like him," recalled Rick Berman. "He didn't feel he had a sense of command. He wouldn't follow this guy into battle. I think it was really more that he didn't audition that well for the part, and that's when we went to our second choice, who was Jonathan Frakes." Frakes himself reflected, "I auditioned seven times over six weeks for this part. Unlike anything I have ever had to fight for before. The last few auditions, I would be sent to Gene's office prior to going to whichever executive needed convincing on this particular audition. I kept going up the food chain. In Gene's office, Gene would give me a pep talk, and Corey Allen, the director of the pilot, was there [....] As a young actor, eager and willing, I really got caught up in [Roddenberry's] vision." Berman concluded that Frakes "turned out to be a terrific choice." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 95)

Riker is one of four characters to appear in two series finales (TNG: "All Good Things..." and ENT: "These Are the Voyages..."), the others being Deanna Troi, Worf, and Miles O'Brien.

One of Riker's costumes from the first season of TNG was added to the ScienceFictionArchives.com collection and was showcased at Paris science museum during a 2010-2011 exhibition, "Science (and) Fiction: Imagination Meets Reality". 

Riker was the inspiration for the custom Minecraft skin of Yogscast co-founder Lewis Brindley, better known as Xephos. Originally, the skin was Riker, but it evolved into its own character. 

Riker was the inspiration of the TV Tropes ideal of "Growing the Beard" – the concept of a series or franchise becoming markedly better than previous installments after a certain point – by the fact that, after actor Jonathan Frakes grew a beard for season two, TNG began to take a turn for the better in various ways. 

Riker narrated the commentary on the Star Trek: The Next Generation Interactive Technical Manual and also appeared in the original Star Trek: The Experience: Klingon Encounter ride at the Las Vegas Hilton.

According to StarTrek.com, William Riker was born on August 19 2335, in Valdez, Alaska, and his mother's middle initial was "C." The Star Trek Encyclopedia (3rd ed., p. 411), also, stated that Riker was born in Valdez.

The character of Riker was originally conceived as an "executive officer" who would handle the duties for which a proper captain should be too busy. Also, it was an attempt to address the often criticized tendency for Captain Kirk in TOS to get directly involved in away missions, something that should be left to others. Captain Picard was, from the outset, conceived as an older man who, like a proper captain, would have more managerial and administrative role (rarely leaving the ship) while a younger officer and his subordinates handles the away missions. The first season attempted this with limited success but this format was abandoned by the beginning of season two.

Apocrypha
In the alternate future of the Pocket DS9 book series Millennium, Riker was made captain of the Enterprise-F after Jean-Luc Picard was promoted to admiral. Among his crew were Deanna Troi, Geordi La Forge, Tom Paris, and B'Elanna Torres. However, the Enterprise-F was lost with all hands during a bloody battle with the Grigari. This timeline was eventually erased.

Before Riker's middle name was established as "Thomas", it was given as "Thelonius" – perhaps after famous jazz musician Thelonious Monk, as a way to reflect Riker's love of that music style – in Peter David's novel, Imzadi. That book also delved into the relationship between Riker and Troi.

The novel Q-Squared gives Riker's full name as "William Thomas Thelonius Riker".

In the Star Trek: Destiny trilogy, Riker and the crew of the USS Titan were one of three ships that were instrumental in the final conflict with the Borg, including connecting the Columbia NX-02 to the Borg and locating the Caeliar and Captain Hernandez. In the followups, Riker and Troi have a child together and name it Natasha, after their old friend from the Enterprise-D.

Riker is promoted to admiral in the Star Trek: The Fall miniseries, as Fleet Admiral Leonard James Akaar suspected a conspiracy in the upper echelons of Starfleet Command and needed someone in the admiralty that he knew he could trust. Despite his new position, Riker retains the Titan as his flagship, and attempts to go on missions on it whenever he can.
