James Tiberius "Jim" Kirk was a male Human Starfleet officer who lived during the 23rd century.

Kirk was arguably one of the most famous and highly decorated starship captains in the history of Starfleet. As the commanding officer of the Constitution-class starships USS Enterprise and USS Enterprise-A, Kirk served United Federation of Planets interests as an explorer, soldier, diplomat, and time traveler.

His missions were known to grade school students and required reading for Starfleet Academy cadets alike. (Star Trek Generations; VOY: "Q2") The Academy's own Early Starfleet History noted such exploits as saving of the Pelosians from extinction, despite it being a violation of the Prime Directive, much like he had with the Baezians and Chenari years earlier, as well as a record-setting number of first contacts. (VOY: "Q2") Kirk's record stood until the 2370s, when Captain Kathryn Janeway set a new record by being the first Federation captain in the previously unexplored Delta Quadrant. (VOY: "Friendship One")

Early history
Origins
Kirk was born on Earth in Iowa on March 22nd, 2233 as a citizen of the Federation. (TOS: "The Deadly Years"; Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home; Star Trek V: The Final Frontier; ENT: "In a Mirror, Darkly, Part II" production resource) He was the son of George and Winona Kirk. His parents named him after his maternal grandfather, James, and his paternal grandfather, Tiberius. (TAS: "Bem"; Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country; Star Trek)

Kirk also had one older brother, George Samuel. (TOS: "What Are Little Girls Made Of?", "Operation -- Annihilate!") He was a descendant of late 19th century American frontier pioneers. (TOS: "Spectre of the Gun")

Tarsus IV
Governor Kodos in 2246
In 2246, Kirk was living on Tarsus IV during a food crisis that was starving the colony, which consisted of eight thousand people. Governor Kodos, sympathetic to old eugenics philosophies and unaware that supply ships were imminent, tried to save a portion of the colony by killing four thousand colonists he deemed least desirable or able to survive. The thirteen-year-old Jim Kirk was one of only nine eyewitnesses to the massacre. (TOS: "The Conscience of the King")

Starfleet career
Academy years
In 2252, Kirk entered Starfleet Academy, with help of Mallory, whose son later served under Kirk. (TOS: "Shore Leave", "The Apple") He often spoke of his father as being his inspiration for joining Starfleet. (Star Trek)

Finnegan as he appeared in 2252
As a plebe, Kirk soon caught the attention of a boisterous and bullying Irishman named Finnegan. The upperclassman evidently hazed "Jimmy-boy" mercilessly throughout their shared time at the Academy. Fifteen years later, the Shore Leave Planet sensed Kirk's antipathy for Finnegan and produced a simulacrum that Kirk could pummel for satisfaction. (TOS: "Shore Leave")

As a cadet, Kirk participated in a successful peace mission to Axanar, for which Starfleet Command awarded him with the Palm Leaf of Axanar Peace Mission. (TOS: "Court Martial", "Whom Gods Destroy")

When he was a midshipman, Kirk began a friendship with his instructor, Lieutenant Benjamin Finney. Their relationship was so important to the two men that Finney named his daughter, Jame, after Kirk. (TOS: "Court Martial")

Kirk's physical training included tests he had to pass for working in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, as well as hand-to-hand combat. (TOS: "Tomorrow is Yesterday"; TAS: "The Pirates of Orion") He was also trained in hyper-power circuits. (TOS: "Dagger of the Mind")

His academic studies introduced him to several men that he encountered later in his career. Among them was John Gill, a noted history professor and cultural observer. (TOS: "Patterns of Force") Kirk studied the exploits of Garth of Izar, a famous captain who joined Kirk's pantheon of heroes. (TOS: "Whom Gods Destroy") The "Pasteur of archaeological medicine", Dr. Roger Korby, became a man Kirk wanted to meet. (TOS: "What Are Little Girls Made Of?") Kirk also studied the military strategies of Klingon General Korrd. (Star Trek V: The Final Frontier) He also attended lectures at the Academy on the Nomad space probe. (TOS: "The Changeling")

During his time in the Command Training Program, Kirk confronted the Kobayashi Maru scenario. He refused to accept his first two defeats. Before making a third attempt, he secretly reprogrammed the simulation computer, consequently becoming the only cadet in Academy history to beat the "no-win" scenario and earning a commendation for original thinking. (Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan)

Kirk's graduating class was represented with such future officers as Corrigan, Mike, Teller, and Timothy. (TOS: "Court Martial") One of his former classmates, R.M. Merik, was dropped in his fifth year for failing the psychosimulator test. (TOS: "Bread and Circuses")

Early postings and assignments
Kirk was commissioned as a Starfleet officer with the serial number SC937-0176CEC. (TOS: "Court Martial")

Among his early missions was the Vulcanian expedition, along with former classmate Timothy. (TOS: "Court Martial") He had also, at one point, visited Alpha Majoris I, where he had personally witnessed the native mellitus. (TOS: "Wolf in the Fold")

Also early in Kirk's career, he became quite familiar with the work of Doctor Tristan Adams. He even had the opportunity to visit penal colonies that had been revolutionized by Adams, later describing what he saw as "clean, decent hospitals for sick minds," even describing them as "resort colonies", as opposed to "cages". (TOS: "Dagger of the Mind")

USS Republic
During the mid-2250s, "some years" after being a midshipman, Ensign Kirk rejoined his friend and former instructor, Lieutenant Finney, when they served together aboard the USS Republic. When Finney made a mistake nearly catastrophic to the ship, Kirk logged the incident, which resulted in his friend being reprimanded and put to the bottom of the promotion list. (TOS: "Court Martial")

Academy instructor
During the same period, Lieutenant Kirk worked as an instructor at the Academy. It was around this time he first met Cadet Gary Mitchell, who was a student in his class where, according to the upperclassmen, "you either think or sink". Mitchell later remembered Kirk as "a stack of books with legs." In an attempt to divert his friend's attention and make the class easier to get through, Mitchell set Kirk up with a "little blonde lab technician" whom Kirk almost married. (TOS: "Where No Man Has Gone Before")

Kirk's early career included a year alongside Janice Lester, during which time the two became romantically involved. The perceived lack of opportunities for a woman to command a starship struck them both as unfair, but she became embittered by the supposed career barrier. Their relationship soured to a point where Kirk felt she punished and tortured him for her circumstances. Years later, Kirk said that he never stopped her from going on with her "space work", but ultimately felt that "we'd have killed each other" if they had stayed together. Lester recalled that Kirk walked out on her "when it became serious." (TOS: "Turnabout Intruder")

USS Farragut
In 2255, upon graduating from Starfleet Academy, Kirk began his service under Captain Garrovick. His first deep space assignment was as a lieutenant aboard Garrovick's USS Farragut. As a phaser gun crew member, he was assigned to a phaser station. (TOS: "The Corbomite Maneuver", "Obsession")

Later that year, the young lieutenant visited Neural on his first planetary survey mission. He befriended one of the planet's natives, the Hill man Tyree. Kirk's report described a primitive but promising culture, and Starfleet endorsed him recommending a policy of non-interference. (TOS: "A Private Little War")

In 2257, the Farragut engaged the dikironium cloud creature at Tycho IV. The creature killed Garrovick and two hundred of the ship's crew. Farragut's record tapes of the event included Kirk insisting upon blaming himself for the disaster, citing his delay in firing the ship's phaser banks at the creature as he lost consciousness. The ship's executive officer disagreed, stating, "Lieutenant Kirk is a fine young officer who performed with uncommon bravery." (TOS: "Obsession")

Commanding the USS Enterprise
The USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)
Kirk's Starfleet service through the late 2250s and early 2260s was rewarded with a rapid rise through the ranks. By 2265, at the age of thirty-two, Kirk assumed command of the Constitution-class USS Enterprise from Christopher Pike. (TOS: "The Menagerie, Part I") Kirk's father lived long enough to see his son earn his first captaincy. (Star Trek)

Along with the Enterprise, Kirk also acquired Pike's science officer, a Vulcan lieutenant commander named Spock, as his first officer. For his first command, he also requested to have Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell along with him. (TOS: "Where No Man Has Gone Before") Also under his command was his former instructor, Ben Finney. (TOS: "Court Martial")

Kirk was initially quartered on Deck 12 in 2266, before moving to Deck 5, room "3F 121". (TOS: "Mudd's Women", "Journey to Babel")

Kirk and Spock graffiti
At some point during the 2260s, Kirk and "his pointy-eared pal" attempted to "crash" the Command Conference afterparty on Starbase 25, but struck out and settled to end the night in a nearby dive bar. Over a century later, two other Starfleet officers– Beckett Mariner and Brad Boimler– also struck out, before ending up in the same bar. 

In recollecting the incident, the alien bartender, who coincidentally was the same who served Kirk and Spock years before, added to her story that "[t]he blonde one did most of the drinking." Before they left, "Kirk + Spock" was left behind, scrawled into the bar's countertop. Likewise, before Mariner and Boimler left, they too scrawled their names alongside those of their heroes. (LD: "An Embarrassment Of Dooplers")

Year One
USS Enterprise in 2265
For five years, Kirk commanded the Enterprise, which made him a legend in space exploration. (Star Trek: The Motion Picture; VOY: "Q2") In addition to his primary mission statement – "to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life, and new civilizations" – Kirk received standing orders to investigate all quasars and quasar-like phenomena. (TOS: "The Corbomite Maneuver", "The Galileo Seven", "Return to Tomorrow")

On more than one occasion, Kirk and Mitchell took part in missions together, including one on Dimorus, where they encountered rodent-like creatures that shot poisonous darts. Mitchell took one of the darts meant for Kirk, saving Kirk's life but nearly dying himself. The two later visited Deneb IV where, in at least three cases, Mitchell was capable of carrying long telepathic conversations with the natives, scoring 80% or higher on comprehension. One night, a telepathic conversation with a female native had a deleterious effect on Mitchell. Kirk later stated that he'd been worried about Mitchell ever since that night. As a pun, Mitchell referred to the girl as a nova. (TOS: "Where No Man Has Gone Before")

Kirk faces the unknown
Following a stopover at the Aldebaron colony, the Enterprise attempted to determine the whereabouts of the missing SS Valiant. After discovering the Valiant's disaster recorder which described a catastrophic disaster following that early vessel's visit to the galaxy's edge, Kirk pushed on and encountered the galactic barrier for his first time. The Enterprise failed to breach the barrier and barely escaped destruction. With its warp engines badly damaged, the Enterprise limped under impulse power towards the Delta Vega lithium cracking station.

The barrier triggered a transformation in Mitchell who began developing psychic powers that progressed rapidly, with a commensurate loss of his humanity. Ignoring Spock advising him to destroy Mitchell immediately, Kirk hesitated until after Mitchell killed navigator Lee Kelso. On the surface of Delta Vega, he hunted Mitchell and managed to kill him only with the help of another officer undergoing the same transformation as Mitchell, Dr. Elizabeth Dehner. (TOS: "Where No Man Has Gone Before")

Following the tragedy, Kirk shuffled the Enterprise's command crew. Lieutenant Commander Spock remained science officer and Kirk acknowledged him as first officer. A new chief medical officer, Dr. Leonard McCoy, replaced Dr. Mark Piper. Lieutenant Commander Montgomery Scott remained chief engineer. Lieutenant Nyota Uhura became communications officer and Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu was transferred from astrosciences to the helm. Kirk did not settle on a regular navigator for another two years. (TOS: "The Corbomite Maneuver", "Catspaw", "Amok Time", "Who Mourns for Adonais?")

Year Two
On stardate 1512.2, Kirk made first contact with the First Federation, when the Enterprise was detained by Captain Balok and a massive spaceship under Balok's command, the Fesarius. Both captains bluffed ferociously, but Kirk's poker face held. Balok proved to be quite friendly, eager to begin a cultural exchange. (TOS: "The Corbomite Maneuver")

McCoy curing Kirk of polywater intoxication
On stardate 1533.6, Kirk and his crew made a brief first contact with the Thasians, an uncanny group of aliens. While interacting with Charlie Evans, a temporary visitor to the Enterprise, Kirk demonstrated prowess with judo, and deep-rooted compassion when Charlie's "teachers" wanted to return him to an isolated existence. (TOS: "Charlie X")

The Romulan commander
Kirk repelled the first Romulan incursion into Federation space in over a century, on stardate 1709.2. A Romulan Bird-of-Prey equipped with a cloak and a powerful plasma torpedo system destroyed four Earth Outpost Stations along the Romulan Neutral Zone. Kirk engaged and pursued the Romulan ship, disabling it before the Romulan commander ordered his own ship's self-destruction. Kirk and his bridge crew became the first Starfleet officers to make visual contact with a Romulan, finally revealing their appearance to Starfleet. (TOS: "Balance of Terror")

The Enterprise reached Exo III on stardate 2712.4, where Dr. Roger Korby was found after years of silence, exploring and exploiting a sophisticated android manufacturing technology – the legacy of a long-dead civilization. Korby had replaced his own damaged body, transplanting his personality into an android replica, and built himself a beautiful companion, Andrea. Against Kirk's wishes, an android duplicate of Kirk was created too. However, the android Korby, after exhibiting madness, destroyed himself. (TOS: "What Are Little Girls Made Of?")

On stardate 2817.6, Kirk responded to a call from Dr. Thomas Leighton, a fellow survivor and witness to the horror of Tarsus IV. Leighton suspected the leader of a traveling theater troupe, actor Anton Karidian, of being Kodos "the Executioner", a man long thought dead. After Leighton was murdered and other witnesses' deaths were revealed, Kirk convinced Anton Karidian's daughter, Lenore, to bring the acting troupe aboard the Enterprise. Attempted murders of Kirk and Enterprise crewmember Kevin Riley (another survivor) led Kirk to confront Karidian (who was indeed Kodos), discovering the recent killings were the acts of his mad daughter, trying to protect her tormented aging father. (TOS: "The Conscience of the King")

Year Three
Kirk's court martial proceedings
Kirk became the first Federation starship captain to ever face a court martial, after he was accused of causing the death of Lt. Commander Benjamin Finney, the Enterprise records officer. Kirk employed Defense Attorney Samuel T. Cogley, and Kirk's former flame Areel Shaw acted as prosecutor at his trial, which was held on Starbase 11, convened by Commodore Stone. Kirk was exonerated after Finney was discovered alive, having faked his death and the evidence implicating Kirk. (TOS: "Court Martial")

James T. Kirk
When Spock kidnapped his former commander, Fleet Captain Christopher Pike, who had been horribly crippled, and commandeered the Enterprise in 2267, he inadvertently jeopardized Kirk's command. After Spock locked the ship on course to Talos IV, Kirk was a member of a tribunal that tried Spock, the other members being Pike himself, and an illusion of Commodore Mendez. Spock's crimes were in violation of General Order 7 and were punishable by death. Once it was revealed that Spock's ultimate goal was to allow Pike, a Starfleet hero, to live a semblance of normality under Talosian illusion, Starfleet declined to prosecute the matter. (TOS: "The Menagerie, Part I", "The Menagerie, Part II")

When the Enterprise passed through the Omicron Delta region, Kirk hoped to arrange for his crew (and himself) to take some badly needed shore leave. While Kirk and his landing party investigated a candidate planet to determine its suitability for that purpose, they were beset with manifestations of hidden desires they had. In fact, they had discovered the Shore Leave Planet, and advanced technologies which an ancient, enigmatic species had left behind. (TOS: "Shore Leave")

On stardate 2124.5, a being calling himself "General Trelane (retired), the Squire of Gothos" waylaid the Enterprise. Though immensely powerful and troublesome, Trelane was revealed to be nothing more than a child of his species, and a badly behaved one at that. Kirk was put on trial, albeit this time in an illusory court, by Trelane. (TOS: "The Squire of Gothos")

Kirk fighting the Gorn captain
Kirk made first contact with the Gorn Hegemony and the Metrons on stardate 3045.6. Finding a Federation base on Cestus III destroyed and Gorn forces lying in wait, Kirk ordered the Enterprise to give chase to a Gorn starship that had been responsible for the attack, intending to destroy it. The pursuit took the two belligerents through Metron space. The Metrons, pacifistic but powerful, interrupted the engagement and declared both sides were savages.

Kirk and the Gorn captain were removed from their respective ships by the Metrons and deposited on a desolate planetoid, where the Metrons forced the two captains to fight each other, threatening to destroy the loser's vessel. Kirk was victorious, but refused to kill the Gorn. Kirk's act of mercy impressed the Metrons, who allowed both ships to go free. (TOS: "Arena")

Khan in 2267
The Enterprise discovered the SS Botany Bay, an ancient sleeper ship, on stardate 3141.9. The vessel carried a group of genetically engineered Augments from Earth's Eugenics Wars, kept alive in cryogenic freeze. Their leader, Khan Noonien Singh, seduced Enterprise historian Lieutenant Marla McGivers, revived his comrades, and attempted to steal the starship – before Kirk stopped him. Somewhat respectful of Khan's integrity and abilities, Kirk exiled Khan and his people on planet Ceti Alpha V, where the former tyrant would have a chance to "tame a world" without threatening others. (TOS: "Space Seed")

Kirk, along with Spock, locate Landru on Beta III
On stardate 3192.1, the Enterprise was caught up in a "civilized" interplanetary war between Eminiar VII and Vendikar, whose engagements were fought only by computers, and marked "casualties" among the citizenry dutifully reported to death chambers. After the Enterprise was declared a target and the crew ordered to die, Kirk destroyed the Eminiar computers, forcing them to finally treat with their enemy – or face a war that would destroy their civilization. (TOS: "A Taste of Armageddon")

Accompanied by Spock and McCoy, Kirk discovered the first known silicon-based lifeform, a sentient Horta matriarch, on the mining colony Janus VI on stardate 3196.1. (TOS: "The Devil in the Dark")

At the start of another war between the Federation and the Klingon Empire, Kirk and Spock met with the Organian Council of Elders personally and attempted to convince the Organians, who were apparently primitive, to accept Federation protection. Shortly after the planet Organia was subsequently occupied by Klingons, Kirk and Spock began conducting a guerrilla war against the Klingon occupation, but Organians abandoned their false humanoid forms and intervened, forcing an end to the interstellar war and imposing the Treaty of Organia. Organians predicted that, in time, the antagonistic powers would eventually become friends. (TOS: "Errand of Mercy")

Responding to the Deneva colony having recently gone silent, Kirk found that a hive-mind of marauding flying parasites had killed his brother, George Samuel Kirk, and that the colony's remaining population was under their influence, causing mass insanity. McCoy and Spock were able to develop a method of killing the exotic creatures. (TOS: "Operation -- Annihilate!")

By this time in 2267, Kirk had finally settled on Ensign Pavel Chekov as the Enterprise's regular navigator. (TOS: "Catspaw")

Kirk diverted the Enterprise from an assigned ceremonial mission on Altair IV to Vulcan on stardate 3372.7, in order to save his first officer from the dangerous effects of his pon farr mating cycle. In the presence of the Vulcan matriarch, T'Pau, Kirk was forced to participate in Spock's marriage ceremony. (TOS: "Amok Time")

On the planet Halkan, a transporter malfunction swapped the Enterprise landing party with a corresponding landing party from a parallel "mirror universe" where a savage, oppressive, Terran Empire had replaced the United Federation of Planets. A sadistic alternate version of Captain Kirk captained the ISS Enterprise, whose first officer was a ruthless, bearded Spock. (TOS: "Mirror, Mirror")

A distress call led the Enterprise to the crippled USS Constellation after an ancient machine, deemed a "planet killer", had nearly destroyed that starship. After Matt Decker, a Starfleet commodore who was now mentally unbalanced, made a suicide run with a stolen shuttlecraft, Kirk piloted the Constellation inside the machine, detonating the engines and destroying the device. (TOS: "The Doomsday Machine")

Kirk, Spock, and McCoy discovered Zefram Cochrane, the inventor of the warp drive, missing for 150 years, on a planetoid. An energy being Cochrane called "the Companion" had kept him alive and young all those years. At Cochrane's request, Kirk did not log the encounter. (TOS: "Metamorphosis")

While visiting a Federation science colony on Gamma Hydra IV, strange radiation from a rogue comet affected Kirk and members of his party, causing rapid aging. Kirk's accelerated dotage forced Commodore Stocker, who was visiting the Enterprise, to relieve Kirk from command of the ship until Dr. McCoy discovered a cure. After Kirk was cured, he managed to maneuver the Enterprise out of the Neutral Zone and away from Romulan ships via a bluff. (TOS: "The Deadly Years")

Year Four
On stardate 4523.6, the Enterprise was dispatched to Deep Space Station K-7, Klingons, Federation bureaucrats, and myriads of cuddly but prodigious tribbles tested Kirk's patience. (TOS: "The Trouble with Tribbles"; DS9: "Trials and Tribble-ations") Unknown to Kirk, Benjamin Sisko and the crew of the USS Defiant observed and facilitated his actions after a Bajoran Orb: the Orb of Time brought them from the 24th century; Sisko even got Kirk's autograph (although Kirk thought he was signing a shipping order) and told Kirk that it had been an honor to serve with him. (DS9: "Trials and Tribble-ations")

Kirk found the contaminated society of Sigma Iotia II, based on 1920s Chicago gang culture, puzzling at first, but he quickly warmed to it. Uniting the world's "gangs" under one "boss", the Iotians became a Federation protectorate. (TOS: "A Piece of the Action")

On Neural in 2268
Kirk returned to Neural, the site of his first Starfleet assignment, on stardate 4211.4. Klingons had begun supplying the primitive native villagers with firearms, leading them to war on the neighboring Hill People. Kirk decided to supply the Hill People with similar weaponry, escalating the conflict, but putting both sides on equal footing. (TOS: "A Private Little War")

After John Gill failed to report in from a cultural observation mission to Ekos, the Enterprise was assigned to investigate. Kirk found his old professor had developed an idealization of Utopian fascism and had abandoned observation for intervention, creating a Nazi-like world government that overwhelmed Gill's best intentions. Kirk aroused the subverted Gill in time to avert Ekos' impending war with neighboring Zeon, and heard Gill recant his philosophies before he died. (TOS: "Patterns of Force")

Scouts from the Kelvan Empire in the Andromeda Galaxy hijacked the Enterprise for their return voyage on stardate 4657.5. The Enterprise, modified with Kelvan technology, became the first Federation starship known to cross the galactic barrier, briefly leaving the boundary of the Milky Way Galaxy before Kirk and his senior officers overwhelmed the Kelvans and returned to Federation space. (TOS: "By Any Other Name")

On stardate 4842.6, the Enterprise discovered the Amerind planet, where an ancient race, the "Preservers", had transplanted elements of Native American cultures that had been endangered in centuries past. When an accident separated Kirk from the landing party and caused him to suffer amnesia, Spock was forced to abandon the search, in order to command the Enterprise in the interception of an asteroid on course to hit the planet. For several months, the inhabitants worshiped Kirk as a god called "Kirok". During that time, Kirk took a wife. Upon the Enterprise's return and the restoration of his memories, Kirk was able to activate an ancient planetary defense mechanism, which the Preservers had left behind, and thereby destroy the approaching asteroid. (TOS: "The Paradise Syndrome")

In Romulan disguise in 2268
Inexplicably to his crew, Kirk began exhibiting bizarre behavior on stardate 5027.3, and ordered the Enterprise across the Romulan Neutral Zone. Three Romulan starships detained the Enterprise, and Kirk and Spock met the Romulan commander aboard her ship, where Kirk's death was faked. The ruse allowed Kirk, surgically altered to look Romulan, to infiltrate the Romulan vessel and steal its cloaking device. Using the device, the Enterprise cloaked and escaped to Federation space, taking along the captured Romulan commander. The entire operation had been designed to give the Federation deniability in case of failure, and place the culpability on Kirk. (TOS: "The Enterprise Incident")

Kirk telekinetically controlling Alexander on Platonius
Near Tholian space on stardate 5693.2, the Enterprise discovered the USS Defiant, adrift and its crew dead, trapped in a spatial interphase. Tholian commander Loskene responded to the trespass of "recently annexed" Tholian space. Kirk was lost in the interphase and presumed dead. The Enterprise exchanged fire with the Tholians, and the unstable region incited madness among the crew. A second Tholian vessel joined the engagement, producing a web to ensnare the Enterprise. After various crew members witnessed Kirk's spectral image, he was retrieved from interphase, and the Enterprise used the rift to escape Tholian entrapment. (TOS: "The Tholian Web")

The Enterprise visited a Federation asylum on Elba II on stardate 5718.3. Kirk's longtime hero, Fleet Captain Garth of Izar, was committed as a patient. Garth, capable of cellular metamorphosis, assumed Kirk's form in an attempt to escape and commandeer the Enterprise. Spock was able to determine which man was truly his captain, and Garth was returned to rehabilitation. (TOS: "Whom Gods Destroy")

Year Five
A deadly plague struck the crew of the Enterprise before stardate 5843.7. Seeking a cure on Holberg 917G, Kirk encountered Flint, a near-immortal Human. Born as Akharin, during Earth's 4th millennium BC in Mesopotamia, Flint had later been known as Solomon, Alexander the Great, and Leonardo da Vinci, among other famous identities. Kirk fell in love with Rayna Kapec, an android Flint had built to give him company in his final days of seclusion. (TOS: "Requiem for Methuselah") A century later, Captain Janeway of the USS Voyager expressed some doubt about this encounter. (VOY: "Concerning Flight")

Kirk, aged greatly, on the second planet in the Taurean system
An incredibly realistic simulacrum of Kirk's hero, the American President Abraham Lincoln, greeted the Enterprise on stardate 5906.4. On the surface of the planet Excalbia, a silicon-based Excalbian re-created the historical figures Surak, Genghis Khan, Phillip Green, Kahless, and Zora. Kirk, Spock, Lincoln, and Surak were pitted against the others as means for the Excalbians to understand the nature and strength of good versus evil. (TOS: "The Savage Curtain")

Reaching the end of its five-year deployment in 2270, Kirk ordered the Enterprise set on a course returning the ship to Earth. (Star Trek: The Motion Picture; VOY: "Q2")

Time travel
Several of Kirk's voyages involved travel through time, either personally through time portals or along with the entire starship Enterprise via acceleration through gravity wells. According to the Federation's Department of Temporal Investigations, Kirk, who sometimes ignored regulations when he felt it was for the greater good, amassed seventeen separate temporal violations during his career, more than any other person on file as of 2373.

His time-travel exploits were well-known enough that, when Sisko, after he and his crew returned to the 24th century, told Dulmur and Lucsly that the vessel they had encountered in the past was the first Enterprise, the two DTI investigators shrugged at the realization that it was "his" ship, which Sisko proudly confirmed. Kirk was regarded by DTI as a "menace". (DS9: "Trials and Tribble-ations")

Earth's 20th century
Kirk and crew visited 20th century Earth on multiple occasions during his captaincy.

The Guardian of Forever
In 2267, after experiencing violent time distortions, the Enterprise discovered the source, the Guardian of Forever. McCoy, delusional from an accidental cordrazine overdose, entered the time portal, altering history to the extent that the Federation and the Enterprise no longer existed. Kirk and Spock followed McCoy, appearing in 1930 New York City on Earth. Kirk found himself and Spock shelter in exchange for work, falling in love with a beautiful, idealistic benefactor, Edith Keeler. After Spock discovered that McCoy had prevented history's recorded death of Keeler, Kirk was forced to restrain the doctor from saving her life again, the price for restoring the timeline. (TOS: "The City on the Edge of Forever")

When the Enterprise traveled back in time from 2267 to Earth of 1969 but was accidentally observed by the United States Air Force, Kirk, with Sulu, beamed down to a military base in Omaha, Nebraska, to destroy photographic evidence of the Enterprise's appearance. By warping around the sun's gravity well in a slingshot maneuver, Kirk and his crew managed to rectify the situation and return to their own time aboard the Enterprise. (TOS: "Tomorrow is Yesterday")

Kirk, with Spock in 1968
In 2268, Kirk was ordered to repeat the recently proven slingshot maneuver, taking the Enterprise back to 1968 on a mission of historical observation. Intercepting enigmatic agent Gary Seven, Kirk attempted to stop his interference but eventually cooperated with Seven's effort to avert a nuclear exchange between the United States of America and the Soviet Union. (TOS: "Assignment: Earth")

Other temporal events
A visit to the planet Sarpeidon, doomed by its sun's impending nova, revealed that the Sarpeidans had escaped en masse into their own planet's past via their Atavachron time portal. The harried and ubiquitous Atoz mistook Kirk, Spock, and McCoy for tardy natives, and he thrust them into the planet's past. (TOS: "All Our Yesterdays")

In 2269, Kirk and Spock used the Guardian of Forever a second time, on a mission of historical observation to the dawn of Orion civilization. Upon their return, no-one but Kirk recognized Spock as the Enterprise first officer. Supposedly killed in his childhood, Spock returned to the Vulcan of his youth, playing the role of a nearly forgotten cousin who had saved his life during the kahs-wan, a Vulcan coming-of-age ordeal. (TAS: "Yesteryear")

Chief of Starfleet operations
As a rear admiral in the mid-2270s
The USS Enterprise returned to Earth in 2270. Kirk's successful mission resulted in his promotion to rear admiral and a posting as Chief of Starfleet Operations at Starfleet Headquarters in San Francisco for the following two and a half years. With Spock leaving Starfleet to return to Vulcan to purge all emotion, Kirk recommended Will Decker to replace him as Enterprise captain while the ship underwent an extensive refit at the San Francisco Fleet Yards, but he told Decker how envious he was and how much he hoped to find a way to get a starship command again. (Star Trek: The Motion Picture)

The V'ger crisis
In the mid-2270s, V'ger, an energy cloud assimilating information from (and destroying) objects in its path, threatened Earth. The only starship positioned to intercept it was the Enterprise, her refit nearly complete but still awaiting trial runs. After convincing Admiral Nogura that he was the best man to meet the threat, Kirk rushed the Enterprise into service, assuming the rank of captain for the duration of the mission. Decker regarded Kirk's command as an insult and a mistake and pointed to his recent desk service and unfamiliarity with the ship's new systems, but the younger man fulfilled his duty as first officer. 

The entity proved to be the late 20th century NASA space probe Voyager 6, having amassed great power and self-awareness in its travels. When Kirk and his party discovered the true nature of V'ger and negotiated a visit to the actual probe itself, located at the heart of the 'V'ger' vessel, Decker used the opportunity, with V'ger's protection, to fulfill his wish to merge with the V'ger entity through the simulacrum of his lover Ilia, thereby uniting V'ger's mechanical nature with its Human origins. The union resulted in the birth of a radically new, and benign, lifeform. (Star Trek: The Motion Picture)

Following the success of this mission, Kirk commanded the Enterprise in the mid-to-late 2270s. His quarters were on deck 5. Kirk retired from Starfleet (albeit briefly) sometime before 2284 to pursue a number of personal goals and affairs, namely his relationship with a woman named Antonia. (Star Trek Generations)

The Genesis incident
"KHAN!!!"
Kirk returned to Starfleet in 2284 and took a position in the admiralty, supervising command-track cadets at Starfleet Academy among his duties. The lack of a center seat gnawed at him until he began to express discontent in his latest posting. If only for the chance to be back in space on his beloved former ship, he eagerly boarded the Enterprise, now commanded by Captain Spock, as an observer to a cadet training cruise.

Khan Noonien Singh escaped from his exile on Ceti Alpha V by hijacking the USS Reliant, leading to his theft of the Genesis Device from the Regula I space station. A call from Dr. Carol Marcus alerted the Enterprise, which changed course to investigate. Despite Kirk's (somewhat half-hearted) protests, Spock insisted on deferring his command to Admiral Kirk, quipping that as a Vulcan "he had no ego to bruise".

The subsequent engagement with his old enemy was tumultuous for Kirk, including a near-disastrous blunder disregarding Starfleet regulations quoted by Saavik that nearly doomed his ship and crew, a meeting with his estranged son, David Marcus, a difficult subsequent battle with Khan, and the resulting death of his friend of twenty years, Spock. (Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan)

Kirk in 2285, stealing the Enterprise
Kirk's return to Earth in 2285 was solemn. The loss of Spock affected Kirk deeply, and McCoy began to show signs of mental illness. Planning to return to the Genesis Planet after his battle-damaged starship was fully repaired, Kirk's hopes were dashed when Commander, Starfleet Fleet Admiral Morrow announced that the Enterprise would soon be decommissioned. 

Ambassador Sarek approached Kirk, leading to the discovery of Spock's katra surviving in McCoy. Kirk's senior officers rallied to him, conspiring to rescue McCoy and steal the Enterprise from Earth Spacedock in order to recover Spock's body from the Genesis Planet and to bring it, and his katra, to Mount Seleya on Vulcan. 

At the Genesis planet, a Klingon Bird-of-Prey's attack left the Enterprise disabled. After setting an auto-destruct sequence, Kirk and his crew abandoned the ship for the surface. The Enterprise was destroyed, taking a Klingon boarding party along with it. Finding Spock's body reanimated by Genesis, Kirk took the Bird-of-Prey to Mount Seleya on Vulcan, where Spock's katra and body were reunited. (Star Trek III: The Search for Spock)

Saving Earth
Kirk and Spock walking the streets of San Francisco in 1986
After three months of exile on Vulcan, Kirk and his crew departed (aboard the Bird-of-Prey renamed HMS Bounty) for Earth, to face their charges of violating nine Starfleet General orders and regulations. During the voyage, a mysterious probe besieged Earth and communicated only in whale song. After answering the planetary distress signal and determining the probe's objective, Kirk used the slingshot effect to take the Bounty back in time to 1986 San Francisco, 300 years ago. 

With the help of cetacean biologist Dr. Gillian Taylor, Kirk successfully obtained the humpback whales George and Gracie and returned with them to 2286. By providing the whales that could answer the probe's query, Kirk redeemed Humanity's extermination of a sentient species and saved Earth from an environmental catastrophe. (Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home)

Commanding the USS Enterprise-A
Year One
Kirk and crew on the bridge of the Enterprise-A
Following the Whale Probe incident, the Federation president declared to Kirk, "we are forever in your debt." In light of their recent heroics, all charges facing his crew were dismissed, but one remained against Admiral Kirk: disobeying the orders of a superior officer. Kirk's punishment was a reduction in rank to captain and a return to the duty that had served the Federation so well, starship command. He was assigned to another Constitution-class starship, the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A), in 2286. He would command the Enterprise-A for the next seven years. (Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home; Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country)

After a brief shakedown cruise proved the Enterprise-A wasn't quite up to par, Kirk vacationed in Yosemite National Park with Spock and McCoy, while Montgomery Scott attended to the technical problems. The respite was interrupted after Spock's half-brother, Sybok, raised a small force called the Galactic Army of Light to take over the planet Nimbus III and captured the Federation, Klingon and Romulan representatives. 

Kirk and the Enterprise-A responded. Most of Kirk's crew fell under Sybok's influence and joined in his quest to meet "God" by taking the starship through the Great Barrier to the legendary Sha Ka Ree. The entity they encountered proved to be a malevolent force, imprisoned and looking for release. Sybok joined the entity in combat, sacrificing himself, permitting the Enterprise-A to escape. (Star Trek V: The Final Frontier)

Final mission
Kirk and McCoy on trial
Kirk's career culminated in 2293, when the Enterprise-A was assigned to escort Klingon Chancellor Gorkon to Earth for a peace conference. Kirk opposed the peace initiative Spock covertly negotiated. He especially resented that Starfleet had chosen him to be the Federation's olive branch. A cabal of Federation and Klingon officials instigated an attack on Kronos One that appeared to come from the Enterprise-A, and assassinated Gorkon. 

The Klingons arrested Kirk and McCoy, then tried and convicted them for the murder of Gorkon, sentencing them to the Rura Penthe penal asteroid. In violation of orders and treaties, Spock took the Enterprise-A into Klingon space, eluded detection and rescued Kirk and McCoy. Following his victory over General Chang at the Battle of Khitomer, Kirk saved the Federation president from assassination, and the historic Khitomer Conference continued.

Kirk, Spock, Scott, Uhura, Chekov, and McCoy seeing the rest of Kirk's crew onboard the Excelsior-class USS Excelsior. Kirk ordered Chekov to set the course "second star to the right, and straight on till morning," as the last flight of the Enterprise-A. After that, she was decommissioned, and Kirk retired permanently from Starfleet. (Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country)

Retirement
Maiden voyage of the Enterprise-B
Kirk briefly taking command of the Enterprise-B
Shortly after retirement, Kirk joined his friends Montgomery Scott and Pavel Chekov as the honored guests of Captain John Harriman on the maiden voyage of the Excelsior-class starship USS Enterprise-B. The event, featuring a media frenzy surrounding Kirk, was little more than a ceremonial cruise, as the Enterprise-B was not yet fully crewed or equipped for regular duty. Soon after departure, the ship received a distress signal from two Whorfin-class ships transporting El Aurian refugees, trapped in an energy distortion called the Nexus.

With the advice of Kirk, and the help of Scott and Chekov, the rescue mission was a partial success, but the Enterprise-B succumbed to the Nexus' gravimetric field. Declining Harriman's offer to take command, Kirk volunteered to modify the ship's deflector relays and successfully enabled the ship's escape, but not before a burst of energy from the Nexus breached the secondary hull. Kirk was lost and presumed dead.

The Nexus and death
Kirk, just before jumping over a chasm
Events of 2371 revealed Kirk had entered the Nexus, yet unaware of the passing of 78 years due to the non-linear nature of time in the Nexus. Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise-D discovered Kirk within the Nexus. Kirk agreed to leave his idyllic but unsatisfying existence to help Picard defeat the deranged scientist Tolian Soran, who was going to destroy the Veridian system.

As Kirk explained to Picard, the main reason he always returned to the command chair of the Enterprise was that it was only there that Kirk could truly make a difference. He advised Picard to refuse anything Starfleet offered him that would take him away from the current Enterprise, because he would thus lose the ability to make a difference in the universe.

"It was... fun. Oh my...."
Kirk sacrificed his life to save the inhabitants of Veridian IV, as well as the crew of the Enterprise-D, climbing along a precariously-balanced metal bridge in order to grab the control panel necessary to disable the missile that Soran would have used, the bridge subsequently falling down a steep cliff when its support beams broke. His last words, spoken to Picard after being assured that he had made a difference, were to comment that his help was the least he could do for the captain of the Enterprise, as well as to assure Picard that "It was... fun. Oh my...." (Star Trek Generations)

Kirk's body buried by Picard
Captain Picard buried Kirk in a simple stone cairn on a Veridian III mountain top, echoing the burial of his friend, Gary Mitchell, 106 years before. (Star Trek Generations; TOS: "Where No Man Has Gone Before")

Legacy
Sometime during or after 2285, Kirk made a brief appearance in a film called The Tardigrade in Space, which was about the adventures of a female tardigrade and a DOT-7 robot called Dot. His appearance in the film depicted his first encounter with Khan Noonien Singh in sickbay, when he was first awakened from cryosleep in the year 2267. (ST: "Ephraim and Dot")

As a child in grade school, future USS Enterprise-B captain John Harriman read about Kirk's missions. (Star Trek Generations)
