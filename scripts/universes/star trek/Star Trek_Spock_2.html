<html><p>Rumors
When an unknown person was beamed on board the USS Enterprise-D in 2370, Ben told a few junior officers that he heard that this was Ambassador Spock. (TNG: "Lower Decks")

In 2380, Ensign Beckett Mariner asked Ensign Brad Boimler if he knew who Spock was, to which Boimler answered, "I think I know who Spock is." (LD: "Second Contact")

The Red Matter incident
Spock arrives too late to prevent Romulus' destruction
In 2387, Romulus faced destruction when its sun threatened to go into a massive supernova. After a synth attack on Mars destroyed the Federation fleet being assembled to evacuate Romulus, Spock formed a plan which involved injecting red matter into the star, thus creating an artificial black hole which would consume the star instead. Piloting the Jellyfish, an advanced spacecraft equipped with red matter, Spock proceeded to the star to carry out his mission. Before he could, the star went supernova and destroyed Romulus. With other worlds threatened with destruction, Spock continued his mission and successfully created a black hole which consumed the supernova. Before he could escape, however, the Romulan mining vessel Narada, commanded by Nero, intercepted him. Nero blamed Spock for Romulus' destruction and was bent on revenge. The black hole eventually pulled in the Narada and the Jellyfish. (Star Trek, PIC: "Remembrance")

Legacy
Spock's self-sacrifice to save the Enterprise from Khan formed the basis of Starfleet's The Needs of the Many holographic training drill, while the rescue of his resurrected self from the Genesis Planet was the basis for the Escape from Spacedock drill. Both simulations were in use by 2381. (LD: "I, Excretus")

By 2399, Spock would become known as "The Great Spock". (PIC: "The End is the Beginning")

His work towards reunification eventually led Romulans to settling on Vulcan and beginning to merge their society with the Vulcans, eventually renaming the planet to Ni'Var. (DIS: "Unification III")

Involvement in the alternate reality
Spock witnesses the destruction of Vulcan
Spock emerged from the black hole in the year 2258 of the alternate reality. Since Nero had emerged twenty-five years earlier, Spock was immediately intercepted by the Narada upon his arrival. Both Spock and the Jellyfish were captured by Nero who had been waiting for him. Spock's life was spared by Nero, although Nero marooned him on Delta Vega where he could witness the destruction of Vulcan from the planet's surface. After Nero used some of the red matter from the Jellyfish to create a black hole in Vulcan's planetary core, Spock watched helplessly from Delta Vega as his homeworld was destroyed.

Spock realizes whose life he just saved
Shortly thereafter, Spock rescued a Starfleet officer from a hengrauggi, only to discover that the young officer was James T. Kirk himself, that reality's Spock having marooned him on the planet for mutiny. The elder Spock was surprised that Kirk was not captain of the Enterprise. When Spock heard from Kirk that Captain Christopher Pike had been captured, Spock knew that Nero was responsible, describing the Romulan as "particularly troubled." Through a mind meld, Spock explained to Kirk his presence in this time period and the reasons behind Nero's actions.

He then walked with Kirk to the Starfleet Delta Vega outpost, where they met Montgomery Scott. Using Scott's equation for transwarp beaming (which Scott had not actually figured out yet), Spock was able to transport Kirk back to the Enterprise along with Scott. When asked why he would not come with them, Spock stated that his other self must not know of his existence, implying that it could cause some kind of temporal paradox. Knowing his younger self would never take the course of action that could stop Nero but that Kirk would, Spock instructed Kirk to use Regulation 619 to force his younger self to give up command to him by proving he was emotionally compromised. He informed Kirk he knew his younger counterpart was emotionally compromised due to the destruction of his homeworld. Kirk followed his advice and, by emotionally manipulating the alternate Spock, managed to take command of the Enterprise.

Spock meets himself
After the Enterprise defeated the Narada and Nero, the elder Spock returned to Earth. There, he met his less-than-surprised younger self (while Kirk had kept his word, his word was no match for even the intellect of the younger Spock, as he had figured out who Kirk's mysterious benefactor must be) and convinced him to remain in Starfleet. He also explained the reason he had not returned to the Enterprise with Kirk to explain things was that he had not wished to deprive Kirk and Spock of the chance of working together and developing the friendship they were destined to have. He then wished his younger self good luck and walked away.

"Thrusters on full..."
Afterwards, Spock witnessed the official promotion of Kirk to captain of the USS Enterprise, repeating what he knew the crew would say before launch, apparently commiserating on his own experiences as a member of the crew of the Enterprise. He left with an intention to establish a Vulcan colony. His attempts to convince his younger self succeeded and the younger of the two Spocks returned to the Enterprise to act as Kirk's first officer. (Star Trek)

Spock warns his younger self just who the Enterprise is up against
A year later, Spock was living on New Vulcan, having made a solemn vow not to further interfere with history by keeping information about his experiences confidential. However, when the younger Spock contacted him for information regarding Khan Noonien Singh, the old Spock felt obligated to break his vow. He responded that Khan was the most dangerous adversary the Enterprise had faced, and that it had required a great sacrifice to stop him. 

Ironically, the younger Kirk later made the same sacrifice Spock himself had made when facing Khan in the prime reality to save the crew of the Enterprise, though he was revived. (Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan; Star Trek Into Darkness)

Final death
Ambassador Spock: 2230.06-2263.02
Spock passed away of natural causes on New Vulcan on January 2, 2263.

Spock and his comrades, 2287
After his death, a small cache of personal items Spock had managed to retrieve from the Jellyfish was turned over to the younger Spock, including a photograph of the prime reality's bridge crew of the Enterprise-A from around 2287, illustrating to the younger Spock that his destiny was to serve alongside Kirk, McCoy, and the others for decades to come. (Star Trek Beyond)

Physiology
Although half Human, Spock's physiology retained most of its Vulcan characteristics such as the green blood, the placement of his liver, (TOS: "The Apple", "A Private Little War") his strength, (TOS: "The Naked Time", "This Side of Paradise", "Operation -- Annihilate!") telepathic abilities, (TOS: "Dagger of the Mind", "A Taste of Armageddon", "By Any Other Name") and his greater lifespan (TOS: "The Deadly Years"; TAS: "The Lorelei Signal"; TNG: "Unification II"; Star Trek) when compared to the average Human. However, it should also be noted that the life he lived was still about forty years shorter than the average Vulcan, who generally lived to be around two hundred years old. His father Sarek, for example, was 203 at his death. (Star Trek Beyond; ENT: "Broken Bow"; TNG: "Sarek"; TNG: "Unification II")

His Human characteristics were obvious when Sarek was in need of a blood transfusion and concern over donating his hybridized blood would be a danger to Sarek's full Vulcan physiology. (TOS: "Journey to Babel") The other instance where his Human side was evident happened during the final stages of his Kolinahr ritual acceptance. While on Vulcan performing the ritual, the V'ger probe approached proximity and its own emotional instability affected Spock's Human emotional side which he worked so hard to repress. (Star Trek: The Motion Picture) Spock's Human side was also present when spores affected him on Omicron Ceti III. (TOS: "This Side of Paradise") 

Like most Vulcans, he experienced pon farr neurochemical imbalance at least every seven years until the symptoms were remedied through ritual mating or kal-if-fee (dueling). If not dealt with, a Vulcan could die within eight days of the first symptoms. Spock experienced pon farr at least twice, once performing the kal-if-fee with Kirk's assistance, once mating with Saavik while physiologically a youth as a result of his regeneration by the Genesis Device. Both successfully relieved his symptoms of pon farr's neurochemical issues. (TOS: "Amok Time"; Star Trek III: The Search for Spock)

As of Vulcan rituals concerning death, Spock was able to transfer his katra into someone that was close to him – such as a family member – who could then transfer the katra into a large repository on Vulcan. In his case, he picked Dr. McCoy as a host for his katra when he decided to expose himself to fatal warp core radiation in order to restore warp power to the Enterprise. His corpse regenerated when his torpedo casing casket was shot towards the Genesis planet and was subjected to the Genesis cycles that rapidly evolved all life on the planet. (Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan; Star Trek III: The Search for Spock)

After Spock received a mind meld from Captain Picard, he seemed to have accepted his Human side. He admitted to being emotionally compromised and showed some emotions when he dealt with Nero destroying Vulcan in the alternate timeline and dealing with his younger self. (TNG: "Unification II"; Star Trek)

On his Human side, Spock once implied he had an ancestral relationship to British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. (Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country)

Personal interests
Spock carried a lifelong interest in art, literature, poetry, music (especially the Vulcan lute and the piano), and three-dimensional chess. (TOS: "Requiem for Methuselah", "Where No Man Has Gone Before", "Charlie X", "The Cloud Minders", "Court Martial"; TAS: "The Jihad", "The Magicks of Megas-Tu") He disliked Italian food, possibly because like most Vulcans, he was a vegetarian. (TOS: "All Our Yesterdays"; TAS: "The Slaver Weapon"; Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home)

Relationships
Friendships
James T. Kirk
Spock with Kirk and McCoy
Spock presumably first met Kirk when the latter succeeded Christopher Pike as captain of the Enterprise in 2265. After the death of Gary Mitchell, Spock's detached and logical analysis was relied on by Kirk as a supplement to his own intuitive and impulsive nature. Their official relationship deepened into a friendship of mutual respect and love that was, without a doubt, the most important relationship of both Spock and Kirk's life. As Edith Keeler observed of Spock's place in the world, "You? At his side. As if you've always been there and always will." (TOS: "The City on the Edge of Forever") 

Kirk once described his Vulcan friend as "the noblest half of myself" and declared that Spock's immortal soul "is my responsibility, as surely as if it were my very own." Kirk even told Spock's father that he would never realize how important Spock was to him, and declared that, despite losing the Enterprise and his son, had he not tried to rescue his friend, "the cost would have been my soul." (Star Trek III: The Search for Spock)

The polywater intoxication that affected the Enterprise crew in 2266 led to a difficult encounter between Spock and Kirk. When Spock was urgently required by his commanding officer, an anguished and reflective Spock was found by Kirk, Spock regretting his inability to express love even for his mother. Trying to bring the first officer around to the moment, Kirk slapped him. Spock's reaction was flat and revelatory, "Jim, when I feel friendship for you, I'm ashamed." Struck again, Spock responded in kind, sending Kirk backwards over a table. (TOS: "The Naked Time")

Spock was sympathetic to Kirk's plight after the transporter divided the captain's personality into opposite aspects. He referred to his own halves, "submerged... constantly at war with each other." Spock believed that Kirk could survive such a contest intact, and urged him to embrace the part of himself that, seemingly ugly, was crucial to his personality and captaincy. (TOS: "The Enemy Within")

Spock comes into conflict with Kirk over destroying a Gorn starship
After Kirk discovered emotional rage was the key to nullifying the effect of the pod plants' spores, his first step in retrieving his crew was to taunt Spock into anger. Anticipating the result of a Vulcan's strength pitted against him, Kirk wielded a pipe for protection. After calling him an "elf with a hyperactive thyroid" and saying he belonged "in the circus, right next to the dog-faced boy," Spock indeed lost control, nearly killing Kirk before regaining control of himself. (TOS: "This Side of Paradise")

Kirk holding Spock after his encounter with a Denevan neural parasite
In 2267, Spock began his pon farr mating cycle, and behaved bizarrely aboard the Enterprise. Kirk called Spock "the best first officer in the Fleet" and "an enormous asset to me" as he pled with Spock to explain his actions. When told that taking Spock to Vulcan was against Starfleet orders, Kirk fired back, "I owe him my life a dozen times over! Isn't that worth a career?" Joining him on Vulcan for his marriage ceremony, Kirk was drawn into T'Pring's scheme to marry another, and forced to fight Spock to the death. McCoy, knowing Kirk was endangered, faked Kirk's death, and the marriage was not consummated. Spock, despondent that he had murdered his captain, was thrilled at the sight of Kirk alive, exclaiming, "JIM!" which McCoy delighted in needling Spock about, once he gained his composure. (TOS: "Amok Time")

Kirk's understanding of Spock had an enormous impact on the parallel mirror universe, visited after a transporter accident in 2267. As Kirk's party prepared to return to their proper universe, Kirk implored the mirror Spock to re-examine his role in the fascistic Terran Empire, insisting, "One man can make a difference." Mirror Spock's consideration of those words led to his rise to dominance and reform of the Empire, with drastic consequences. (TOS: "Mirror, Mirror"; DS9: "Crossover")

When Kirk was trapped in spatial interphase during a rescue operation in Tholian space, Spock ordered the Enterprise to maintain its position in an effort to retrieve him, in spite of the danger the Tholians presented and the disruptive nature of the local space. After Kirk's assumed death, Spock and McCoy viewed the "last orders" Kirk had prepared. He urged Spock to use all the Vulcan disciplines at his disposal, tempered with intuitive insight. Kirk believed Spock had the latter qualities, but should they elude him, he was urged to seek out McCoy. (TOS: "The Tholian Web")

Spock making Kirk "forget" about Rayna Kapec
Kirk once commented to Captain Garth that he and Spock were "brothers". Spock merely responded, "Captain Kirk speaks somewhat figuratively, and with undue emotion, but what he says is logical and I do, in fact, agree with it." (TOS: "Whom Gods Destroy")

When Dr. Janice Lester, a former lover of Kirk's, took over Kirk's body, Spock performed a mind meld on Kirk while he was trapped in Lester's body. Spock believed Kirk was Lester before anyone else, and when Lester as Kirk ordered his execution, he continued to stand by his friend. (TOS: "Turnabout Intruder")

Spock with Kirk aboard the Enterprise again in the 2270s
At the end of the Enterprise's five-year mission, a period marked by his frequent loss of emotional control, Spock chose to leave Starfleet and his friends, to pursue the kolinahr discipline of logic on Vulcan. His return to the Enterprise during the V'ger threat was a cold event, without acknowledgment of his past friendships. In V'ger's aftermath, Spock finally achieved equilibrium, able to express his friendship for Kirk without the influence of aliens or illness, and notably lacking any threat of physical violence. In 2285, Spock was calmly able to tell Kirk, "You're my superior officer. You are also my friend. I have been and always shall be yours." (Star Trek: The Motion Picture; Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan)

Kirk and Spock, together on Kirk's birthday
Spock's sacrifice of his own life, to save the Enterprise from Khan's detonation of the Genesis Device, deeply affected Kirk. At his funeral, Kirk could only bring himself to say of Spock, "Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most... Human." (Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan)

The revelation that Spock's katra, his living spirit, survived in the tormented mind of McCoy, led Kirk to risk his career, and in turn, his crew's. He first asked Fleet Admiral Morrow for permission to retrieve Spock's body from the Genesis Planet, to bring it, and McCoy, to Vulcan. Kirk insisted that any chance to save Spock's soul was his responsibility, "as surely as if it were my very own." His request declined, he told his crew, "the word is No. I am therefore going anyway." 

With the help of Uhura, Scott, Sulu, and Chekov, Kirk rescued McCoy from confinement and commandeered the Enterprise from Earth Spacedock. The renegade mission saw the death of Kirk's ship as well as his son. Finding Spock's body re-animated by Genesis, Kirk brought him and McCoy, to Vulcan for the fal-tor-pan (re-fusion) ritual. The first person Spock recognized was Kirk: "Jim. Your name, is Jim." (Star Trek III: The Search for Spock)

During their homecoming from Vulcan, and eventually their trip to 1986, Kirk tried to remind the resurrected Spock, suffering from memory loss, of their friendship and past adventures together. After Kirk and the crew's trial, Spock told his father, his "associates" were his friends. (Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home)

Spock in an attempt to save Kirk's life at Yosemite National Park
In 2287, Spock accompanied Kirk and McCoy on a camping trip together at Yosemite National Park, which abruptly ended when Spock's half-brother, Sybok, diverted the Enterprise to Nimbus III. After their adventure on Sha Ka Ree and Sybok's death, Kirk referred to Spock once again as his "brother", and told him and McCoy that they were his real family. (Star Trek V: The Final Frontier)

When Spock later entered the alternate reality, he told the James T. Kirk of that reality of their deep friendship, despite the fact that the alternate Spock had marooned Kirk on Delta Vega. Before returning Kirk, along with Scott's counterpart, to the USS Enterprise (revealing to this Scott an advancement in transporter technology over a century before his prime counterpart perfected it), Spock – who in this reality had designed the Kobayashi Maru simulation and openly begrudged Kirk outsmarting it – was reminded that this could be viewed as "cheating", to which he replied that an "old friend" – namely, Kirk – had taught him how to cheat.

Later, when Spock Prime spoke to his own alternate reality counterpart about that universe's Kirk, he explained that he had resorted to a level of subterfuge in order to inform both men of the necessity of their friendship, both to themselves and to others. Spock Prime explained, "I could not deprive you of the revelation of all that you could accomplish together, of a friendship that will define you both in ways you cannot yet realize." (Star Trek)

Leonard McCoy
The relationship between Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy seemed a little strained at times on McCoy's part because of his taunts about Spock's green blood and lack of emotion. However, there was an obvious respect and friendship among James T. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. McCoy, in fact, was one of the two friends Spock requested to join him in his marriage ceremony. (TOS: "Amok Time")

While he would rarely do so without provocation, Spock was also quite capable of turning the tables on the doctor. During Kirk's court-martial, after an astonished McCoy discovered him in the briefing room playing chess against the ship's computer, Spock casually allowed him to assume the worst (to the point of thanking him after the furious doctor had said he was "The most cold-blooded man I've ever known"), waiting until he reached the door to reveal that he had been victorious in four consecutive games – since the computer, whose account of the incident was the main evidence against Kirk, was programmed to be unbeatable, this proved that it had been tampered with (something only Kirk, Spock, and the "dead" Commander Finney were authorized to do), and cast doubt on the credibility of its account, keeping the trial going long enough to discover that Finney was, in fact, alive. 

Later that year, after the Enterprise crew had defeated the androids on planet Mudd (beings almost Vulcan-like in their lack of emotion and their "logical, pragmatic" thinking), McCoy told Spock that he must be quite unhappy to see that "poor, illogical" Humans were able to fairly defeat them, Spock responded that this was quite satisfactory, as nobody needed him and his logical ways as much as a ship full of Humans. (TOS: "Court Martial", "I, Mudd")

Christopher Pike
Spock grew very fond of Pike even so far of risking court martial in 2267 to kidnap his disabled former captain and bring him to Talos IV to live a life of illusion and happiness. (TOS: "The Menagerie, Part I", "The Menagerie, Part II")

Family
Sybok
Sybok, Spock's elder half-brother, encountered Spock on Nimbus III in 2287, shortly before Sybok hijacked the Enterprise-A for his quest to find Sha Ka Ree in the Great Barrier. Spock had remained silent on the subject of his brother for decades, not even telling Kirk until Sybok had already taken control of the Enterprise. At first, Spock was extremely distant from him, but following Sybok's death, he realized what he had lost. (Star Trek V: The Final Frontier)

Michael Burnham
Michael Burnham was Spock's adoptive sister after her parents' presumed deaths. When she first met him, a very young Spock shut his bedroom door on her after greeting her with a holographic drawing of a dragon screaming. Over time, Spock and Michael grew closer and Spock grew to idolize his older adoptive sister. However, feeling that she placed her adoptive family in danger from logical extremists who targeted her due to being Human, Michael decided to run away. Spock tried to persuade her otherwise, telling her that he "loved her" and would run away with her. To push Spock away, Michael insulted him by calling him a "half-breed" who was "incapable of love." While well meaning, her insults deeply hurt Spock who shunned his Human half in response and grew to no longer trust people. Over the years, Michael tried to make amends, but Spock showed no interest in reconnecting.

After they both grew up and entered Starfleet, they rarely talked to each other. Eventually Spock and Michael were forced to come to terms with each other after the Federation-Klingon War. Michael searched for a missing Spock after meeting his commanding officer, Captain Christopher Pike of the USS Enterprise. Eventually finding her brother, she was dismayed to find Spock suffering from a mental breakdown due to an encounter with a time traveler.  She was able to help restore Spock's mind with the help of the Talosians, but this did not resolve the animosity between the siblings as they clashed several times with Spock blaming her for causing the Federation-Klingon war and calling her out on her habit of assuming responsibility for all the wrongs in the universe. Eventually, the two came to terms with their respective short-comings and eventually grow closer as they worked together to solve the mystery of the Red Angel.

When Burnham needed take Discovery to the future in order to avoid Control having access to the Sphere information stored in the ship's memory, Spock volunteered to help her. Unfortunately, while helping Burnham prepare, Spock's shuttle was badly damaged.  Both distraught that they could not be together in the future, they shared a bittersweet farewell and Spock was transported away after one last "live long and prosper." (DIS: "Such Sweet Sorrow, Part 2")

In the months following Discovery's disappearance, Spock was unnerved that they had not received a signal to indicate that Discovery had arrived safely in the future. When the signal arrived, Spock found peace. (DIS: "Such Sweet Sorrow, Part 2")

Burnham and Book watch a holo-recording of Spock
In 3189, Michael Burnham watched a recording of Spock. She told her boyfriend Cleveland Booker that since she had arrived in the 32nd century, she hadn't bothered researching history to find out the type of man that Spock eventually became. But she was proud of who he had became, and she was happy he had found a way to reunify the Vulcans and Romulans. (DIS: "Unification III")

Romances
T'Pring
Spock with T'Pring in 2267
At age seven, Spock was bonded to T'Pring in a family-arranged Vulcan ceremony described in Human terms as "less than a marriage, but more than a betrothal."

When Spock experienced his pon farr of 2267, he succumbed to the madness of the plak tow mating instinct. The Enterprise diverted to Vulcan in time to consummate the marriage. Accompanied by Kirk and McCoy, Spock arrived at his family's ancient koon-ut-kal-if-fee site for the wedding ceremony officiated by the matriarch T'Pau. Unexpectedly – but within the bounds of Vulcan tradition – T'Pring demanded the challenge of kal-if-fee, forcing Spock to earn the right to marry his bride through victory in personal combat. Rather than her prospective consort Stonn, T'Pring chose Kirk as her champion.

Unwilling to appear weak or disrespectful in front of the legendary T'Pau, Kirk agreed to fight his first officer. Between rounds using the lirpa and ahn-woon weapons, T'Pau belatedly revealed the combat was "to the death," and it became clear that Kirk had little chance against Spock in the throes of his blood fever. McCoy intervened, deceptively dosing Kirk with a drug that simulated his death.

Spock's plak tow subsided after his apparent victory. Appalled at the turn of events, Spock calmly questioned T'Pring's decisions. T'Pring admitted her distaste for Spock's growing fame among Vulcans, and her mutual attraction to Stonn. By her logic, choosing Kirk meant neither victor would claim her in the end, and she would have her life with Stonn. Spock acknowledged her way of thinking, referring to it as "flawless". T'Pring, for her part, was honored, but Spock advised Stonn that he would find that "having... is not so pleasing a thing after all... as wanting."

After returning to the Enterprise, McCoy revealed Kirk's clandestine survival. A rare show of extreme emotion came from Spock when he exclaimed "JIM!" with a beaming smile. (TOS: "Amok Time")

Christine Chapel
Spock with Christine Chapel, being emotionally influenced by the Psi 2000 intoxication
When the Psi 2000 intoxication infected the crew of the Enterprise in 2266, Nurse Christine Chapel admitted her love for Spock, who was thereupon emotionally shocked. Her love for him was an ongoing issue, but never interfered with her professional duties. (TOS: "The Naked Time")

Chapel once housed Spock's consciousness to keep him from being destroyed by Henoch. They were later forced by powerful telepaths to kiss each other, but neither enjoyed the forced situation. (TOS: "Return to Tomorrow", "Plato's Stepchildren")

While under the spell of Harry Mudd's love potion, Spock became infatuated with Chapel, and was willing to fight for her love. However, the potion eventually wore off and then Chapel, as a side effect of the drug, seemed to hate Spock for a brief time. Spock commented to Mudd that a few brief moments of love being paid for with several hours of hatred is scarcely a bargain. (TAS: "Mudd's Passion")

Leila Kalomi
On stardate 3417, Spock was infected by Omicron spores while on Omicron Ceti III by Leila Kalomi, who was serving as the Omicron colony's botanist. The spores broke down Spock's emotional control, and he confessed his love for Kalomi. Their time together was short-lived, however, as Kirk deduced a method of destroying the spores with intense emotion and induced anger in Spock.

Once free from the spores, Spock freed Kalomi and the rest of the planet from their influence. He later reflected that his time with Kalomi was the first time in his life at which he had felt happy. (TOS: "This Side of Paradise")

Zarabeth
When visiting the planet Sarpeidon Spock got trapped in in the planet’ ice age in the past with Dr. McCoy. When there Spock began to act like the Vulcans of that time period and started to act emotional. There he fell madly in love with her. Eventually McCoy realized what was happening and they were eventually able to escape back to their time period without Zarabeth. (TOS: "All Our Yesterdays")

"You have a gift for understatement, Mister Spock. It's not a very pleasant prospect at all."


"You didn't really think I was going to beat his head in, did you?"
"I thought you might."
"You're right."


"Well, Mr. Spock, if we can't disguise you, we'll find some way of explaining you."
"That should prove interesting."


"My friend is obviously Chinese. I see you've noticed the ears. They're actually easy to explain."
[Long pause.]
"Perhaps the unfortunate accident I had as a child."
"The 'unfortunate' accident he had as a child. He caught his head in a mechanical... rice picker."


"Don't grieve, admiral. It's logical. The needs of the many... outweigh..."
"The needs of the few."
"Or the one. I never took the Kobayashi Maru test, until now. What do you think of my solution?"


"You know, coming back in time, changing history... that's cheating.""A trick I learned from an old friend."

Background information
Performers
Spock was played by Leonard Nimoy in the vast majority of the character's television and cinematic appearances. The Genesis-regenerated versions of Spock at nine, thirteen, seventeen, and twenty-five years of age in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock were portrayed by Carl Steven, Vadia Potenza, Stephen Manley, and Joe W. Davis, respectively. Spock's screams in that film were provided by Frank Welker. 

The young Spock from TAS: "Yesteryear" was voiced by Billy Simpson. Carey Scott recorded some dialogue for a younger Spock in Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, but his scenes were cut.  Spock is also portrayed by an unknown infant in that film. And while Nimoy portrayed the elder Spock in the film Star Trek, his younger alternate reality adult self was played by Zachary Quinto (who reprised the role in Star Trek Into Darkness and Star Trek Beyond), as well as briefly by Jacob Kogan, who portrayed Spock as a young boy. Nimoy reprised the role of Spock for a cameo in Star Trek Into Darkness. Liam Hughes portrayed a young Spock in the Discovery episode "Brother" while Ethan Peck voiced the adult version of the character in the same episode. Peck also played the character in subsequent episodes of Star Trek: Discovery and Star Trek: Short Treks.

A deleted scene from Star Trek featured a newborn Spock, portrayed by Jenna Vaughn. As Spock's birth would have occurred before the universe split, technically, she would have been the only performer to portray both Spock Prime and his alternate reality counterpart, as well as the only actress ever to play Spock.

Name
Jane Wyatt, who played Spock's mother Amanda Grayson, was once asked by fans at a convention what Spock's first name was. She replied, perhaps jokingly, "Harold" [12] However, the question itself was flawed, since the episode "Journey to Babel" makes it clear that "Spock" is Spock's personal name.

On the other hand, Spock's family name has never been established in canon. In the episode "This Side of Paradise", Leila Kalomi says to Spock, "You never told me if you had another name," to which he replies, "You couldn't pronounce it." D.C. Fontana – who was considered the "Vulcan expert" of the TOS behind-the-scenes staff and who created such details as the fact that Spock's father was an ambassador and his mother a school teacher – revealed, in an issue of the fanzine Spockanalia, that she had intended his family name to be "Xtmprsqzntwlfd", but since this is unpronounceable, there wasn't really any way to get this said in dialogue during an episode.

The Pocket TOS book Ishmael gives Spock's full name as "S'chn T'gai Spock".

Since the release of the film Star Trek, the original reality version of Spock is now often referred to on websites and other media as "Spock Prime", to differentiate from the alternate reality version of the character.

From concept to series
From the start of thinking Spock up, Gene Roddenberry knew he wanted the character to be partly alien, and that he wanted Leonard Nimoy to play the role. Roddenberry later explained, "I made [Spock] a half-caste, because I remember thinking a half-breed Indian would be a lot more interesting than a full-blooded Indian or white, because he's going to be tugged in many different directions." (Star Trek - Where No One Has Gone Before, p. 15)

Gene Roddenberry also wanted Spock's appearance to be very similar to typical portrayals of Satan the Devil. "I did purposely give him a slight look of the 'devil' because I thought that might be particularly provocative to women, particularly when his nature contrasted so greatly to this," Roddenberry stated. [13]

The following character biography appeared in Roddenberry's original, 1964 series pitch Star Trek is... (and was reprinted in The Making of Star Trek) [page number? • edit]:

In the revised first draft script of "The Cage" (dated 6 October 1964), Spock was described thus; "The only exception to the familiar types represented by the crew, Mister Spock is of partly alien extraction, his reddish skin, heavy-lidded eyes and slightly-pointed ears give him an almost satanic look. But in complete contrast is his unusual gentle manner and tone. He speaks with the almost British accent of one who has learned the language in textbooks." The episode's revised final draft script (dated 20 November 1964) excluded mention of the "reddish skin" but otherwise remained the same. Later in the script, one of Spock's statements was directed to be delivered in an "excited" manner.

Gene Roddenberry thought up the unemotional aspect of Spock. Roddenberry explained, "As I created him, I said to myself, 'If I could just get rid of the emotions that plague me and work things out logically... ah, the things I could do!" (Cinefantastique, Vol. 27, No. 11/12, p. 47) Casting Director Joseph D'Agosta added, "On the Spock character, the only guidelines I had were that he had to be thin, and a good actor with no emotion. He was a cold, calculating, logical person. Humor was not even considered at that time." (The Star Trek Interview Book, p. 213)

Actor Martin Landau (Commander John Koenig of Space: 1999) was an early casting consideration for the character of Spock in TOS. This was before the role went to Leonard Nimoy.

In spite of studio request to get rid of "the guy with the ears," Gene Roddenberry insisted on keeping the character through both pilot episodes of the series. (Leonard Nimoy: Star Trek Memories; Mind Meld: Secrets Behind the Voyage of a Lifetime)

According to Leonard Nimoy, he felt the need to play the character as more emotional when Jeffrey Hunter was playing the internalized Christopher Pike, as opposed to William Shatner's portrayal of Captain Kirk. (Mind Meld: Secrets Behind the Voyage of a Lifetime; et al.) Also, there was room for Spock's emotional detachment when the similarly emotionless character of Number One was discarded along with Pike, after "The Cage". (Star Trek - Where No One Has Gone Before, p. 15)

NBC's early-1966 publicity booklet gave this bio for Spock (reprinted in Inside Star Trek: The Real Story):

The unemotional quality of Spock's persona was extremely appealing to Leonard Nimoy. "What immediately intrigued me was that here was a character who had an internal conflict," Nimoy observed. "This half-Human, half-Vulcan being, struggling to maintain a Vulcan attitude, a Vulcan philosophical posture and Vulcan logic, opposing what was fighting him internally, which was Human emotion. There was a dynamic there to work with from an acting point of view." (Star Trek - Where No One Has Gone Before, p. 15)

Gene Roddenberry recognized Spock as a team effort. "I'll take credit for formulating Spock and guiding the character," he said, "then give as much credit to Leonard Nimoy for making it work, and also credit to the writers who kept it going in many story situations." [14] On the other hand, Roddenberry proclaimed, in a letter to Isaac Asimov, "It's easy to give good situations and good lines to Spock." Roddenberry also thought it was easier to write Spock than it was to write McCoy. [15] Nonetheless, the depiction of Spock was still to be further developed as the show began. Recalling the character's genesis, TNG Producer Robert Lewin noted, "Spock was not the hero that he became during the early part of the first series." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 71)

The series writers' guide (third revision, dated 17 April 1967) gave the following description of Spock (Star Trek: The Original Series 365):

Season 2 salary issue
In the spring of 1967, before production began on Star Trek's second season, Leonard Nimoy and his agent got into an argument with the producers regarding the actor's salary (Nimoy felt it unfair that series star William Shatner was paid US$5,000 per episode, while he was only paid US$1,250). The agent wanted US$3000 per episode for his client, and would settle with US$2,500. However, a misunderstanding resulted in the agent believing that Mission: Impossible stars had at least US$11,000 salaries, so he suddenly demanded US$9,000 for Nimoy. The studio, of course, refused. Nimoy threatened to leave the series if the dispute was not solved.

In response to Nimoy's threats, Desilu executive Herb Solow asked Casting Director Joseph D'Agosta to compile a list of possible "Vulcan replacements", in case negotiations went unresolved. Three lists were made of actors who were deemed suitable for the role of Spock:

"A" List: Mark Lenard, William Smithers, Liam Sullivan, Lloyd Bochner, Joe Maross, Donald Harron, Edward Mulhare, James Mitchell, Michael Rennie, Peter Mark Richman, Charles Robinson, Chris Robinson, Stewart Moss, David Canary, John Anderson, David Carradine

"B" List: Anthony James, Perry Lopez, George Bachman, Alan Bergmann, Lee Kinsolving, Blaisdel Makee, Bill Fletcher, Henry Darrow, Anthony George, Curt Lowens, Jacques Denbeaux, Maxwell Reed

"C" List: Lawrence Montaigne, Ron Hayes, Patrick Horgan, Paul Mantee, Bruce Watson, Robert Yuro, Richard Evans, Joseph Ruskin, Ted Markland, Lee Bergere, John Rayner

In reality, these lists were only a psychological ploy to put pressure on Leonard Nimoy and his agent. The only two actors considered as possible replacements were Mark Lenard and Lawrence Montaigne (ironically, both of them appeared as Vulcans in the second season, Lenard playing Spock's father, Sarek).

Eventually, Desilu (at the insistence of NBC) and Nimoy settled with US$2,500 per episode, plus US$100 for additional expenses, a better billing, a better merchandising deal, and more script input. However, when Montaigne was cast as Stonn in "Amok Time", his contract had an option of recalling him to be cast as Spock, "just in case." (Inside Star Trek: The Real Story, pp. 317-324)

Animated depictions
For approximately half an hour while Star Trek: The Animated Series was in early development, a boyhood version of Spock was considered for inclusion as a regular character in the upcoming series, along with other child equivalents of the series' main characters. (The Art of Star Trek, pp. 42 & 43)

While initially developing TAS: "Yesteryear", D.C. Fontana realized she wanted to feature Spock in the story, since he had always been her favorite main character and was the focus of her favorite episodes from the ones she had written for Star Trek: The Original Series, such as "This Side of Paradise" and "Journey to Babel". (Star Trek - Where No One Has Gone Before, p. 56) She was excited by the prospect of showing "part of what made Spock Spock," delving into his backstory in "Yesteryear". (Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages, p. 97)

Reappearances
The notion of Spock suffering racial prejudice, alluded to in TAS: "Yesteryear" and the film Star Trek, was shared by the unmade prequel Star Trek: The First Adventure, in which Spock first met Kirk when he was defended by him from bullies at Starfleet Academy.

Gene Roddenberry once distributed a memo to the TNG writing staff which declared that, due to financial considerations, it would probably be impossible for Leonard Nimoy to ever guest star on that series as Spock (though Roddenberry also suggested Sarek appearing in a guest star role as an alternative). (The Making of Yesterday's Enterprise, p. 22)
