<html><p>Q enlisted her aid in helping his son, "Junior", who had become a troublesome teenager. Janeway helped straighten the boy out and reconciled him with his father. (VOY: "Q2") She also convinced Neelix to stay with a colony of Talaxians they discovered on an asteroid and helped repel a group of miners who had been threatening them. (VOY: "Homestead")

Returning Home
In 2378, Janeway was able to return to Earth with the assistance of Vice Admiral Kathryn Janeway from the early 25th century of an alternate timeline.

Admiral Janeway, from an alternate timeline
Admiral Janeway had provided her present-day counterpart with sophisticated anti-Borg technology, including transphasic torpedoes and ablative generator armor technology, in order for her to enter a nebula that had readings suggesting dozens of wormholes and Borg cubes.

When Voyager reached the nebula guided by Admiral Janeway, she ordered the crew to enter the transwarp hub, but Captain Janeway was reluctant to forgo the opportunity to damage the Borg's infrastructure considerably. Admiral Janeway was initially reluctant, but after Captain Janeway got the support of the crew for her plan, the two Janeways teamed up together to try to do both.

While trying to outrun the cascading shock wave reaction caused by the destruction of one hub, a Borg sphere pursued Voyager and attempted to capture it. Upon exiting the transwarp conduit in the Alpha Quadrant less than a light-year from Earth, Admiral Paris ordered all available ships to intercept, in response to sensor readings indicating a Borg energy signature.

On arrival in the Alpha Quadrant, the Starfleet armada opened fire on the sphere, which had encompassed Voyager, to no avail. However, Voyager destroyed the sphere from inside with a single transphasic torpedo. As this happened, Voyager flew out from the wreckage, much to the surprise and amazement of not only the fleet, but also Admiral Owen Paris, Lieutenant Barclay, and the entire Voyager crew. Voyager was then escorted back home. (VOY: "Endgame")

Conflict with the Borg
Negotiating with the Borg
Janeway earned herself a reputation for dealing with the Borg. Her first encounter with the Borg was in 2371, while Voyager was in drydock at Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards. A former Borg and future crew member from the future traveled back in time with the help of the Federation timeship USS Relativity. (VOY: "Relativity")

Another encounter came about after Janeway aided the Sakari in camouflaging energy readings and ruins from their planet. A single dead Borg drone was found among the rubble. (VOY: "Blood Fever")

While traveling through the Nekrit Expanse, Voyager encountered a Borg cube floating dead in space. There were no power signatures on board and scans revealed 1,100 dead drones. Janeway sent an away team over to the cube to collect and gather information about Borg technology. The away team discovered that all systems on the ship had ceased abruptly due to an electro-mechanical discharge, approximately five years earlier. The team brought back a Borg corpse to analyze.

While leaving the region, Chakotay was forcibly linked to the new Borg Cooperative and made to activate a Borg cube, which was destroyed seconds later by the Cooperative. (VOY: "Unity")

Dealing with Seven of Nine
In late 2373, Janeway had a major dealing with the Borg. After nearly three years of travel, Voyager had reached the edge of Borg space. Janeway increased security and prepared herself and her crew for the eventual crossing of Borg space. Rather than turn around, Janeway and her crew managed to locate a small passage where there was no Borg activity, which they named the "Northwest Passage".

It was later discovered, however, that the absence of Borg activity was due to the presence of a large number of quantum singularities. While en route to the Alpha Quadrant, Voyager's engines stalled as Kim detected fifteen Borg ships closing fast from behind. Fourteen of the ships passed Voyager, but the last one scanned Voyager with a polaron beam. Later, Kim detected that the power signatures of the Borg ships had ceased. Janeway, curious about this, decided to head for their position. When they arrived, the Borg ships were destroyed.

The singularities, in turn, were how a race, supposedly more powerful than the Borg, were entering our domain from their realm of fluidic space. Later, she learned that the Borg's new enemy, designated Species 8472, occupied the passage. Rather than tempt fate with the unusual aliens, Janeway opted to make a treaty with the Borg. Voyager's EMH had discovered a way for Borg nanoprobes to assimilate the previously immune species. Janeway oversaw the development of a new nanoprobe-based bioweapon that was designed to attack Species 8472 at a cellular level. It was during this incident that Seven of Nine was stranded on Voyager.

Janeway caught by a Borg drone
Seven of Nine's newly found individuality caused concern within herself, giving her the need to return to the Borg to be with the others in the Collective. Kathryn Janeway attempted to stop this need by introducing Seven to her past and to what her normal life should have been. Despite much apprehension on Seven's part, Janeway eventually got through to her and she finally accepted her individuality. (VOY: "Scorpion", "Scorpion, Part II", "The Gift")


Between stardates 50953.4 and 50984.3, Voyager was attacked by a Borg probe. After destroying the attacking vessel, several data nodes were salvaged. Using information obtained from the nodes, Janeway devised a plan to raid a Borg sphere and steal one of its transwarp coils, 
Janeway, assimilated by the Borg
 which would speed Voyager's journey home. The mission went well until Seven was captured by the Borg Queen. Janeway led an away team to free her using the Delta Flyer, which had been adapted to withstand the firepower of the Borg. The Borg diamond was destroyed, and Seven was freed. (VOY: "Dark Frontier")

In 2376, Janeway found out that a group of Borg had a genetic mutation that allowed them to exist as they were when they were individuals during their regeneration. This state was named "Unimatrix Zero". Janeway assisted them in fighting Borg without the mutation so that they could remain individuals. She, B'Elanna Torres, and Tuvok introduced a nanovirus into Tactical Cube 138's central plexus, separating the members of Unimatrix Zero from the hive mind. This plunged the Collective into a civil war. (VOY: "Unimatrix Zero")

In 2378, with the help of a future version of herself from an alternate timeline, Janeway discovered a Borg transwarp hub and decided to destroy it rather than use it to return home. With the support of her crew and ultimately her future self, Janeway enacted a risky plan to do both. The plan succeeded and Voyager returned to the Alpha Quadrant, less than a light-year from Earth, having destroyed the hub and a Borg sphere. Although the Admiral Janeway from the future of an alternate timeline allowed herself to be assimilated while infected with a neurolytic pathogen, she thereby annihilated both the Borg Queen and the Unicomplex, dealing a crippling if not fatal blow to the Borg and allowing Voyager to return home. (VOY: "Endgame")

In the alternate future timeline from which Admiral Janeway originated, she was once introduced by Commander Reginald Barclay, when she was about to give a lecture to his cadets at Starfleet Academy, as the person who "wrote the book on the Borg." (VOY: "Endgame")

Later career
Upon the return of Voyager to the Alpha Quadrant, Janeway was promoted to the rank of vice admiral and given an assignment at Starfleet Command. In 2379, she ordered Captain Picard and the USS Enterprise-E on a diplomatic mission to Romulus, in response to a message relayed at a request of the new Romulan praetor, Shinzon. Janeway told Picard that Shinzon was a Reman and that, if the Romulan Empire became unstable, it would mean war for the entire quadrant. Janeway then ended the discussion, sarcastically remarking how Jean-Luc got all the easy assignments. (Star Trek Nemesis)

In the alternate timeline when Voyager returned to Earth in 2394, Janeway would become one of the most decorated officers in all of Starfleet history by 2404. As an admiral, she had done some work with Starfleet Intelligence, though it had concluded by the time she was guest lecturing at Starfleet Academy alongside then-Commander Reginald Barclay at the Communications Research Center. (VOY: "Endgame")

Personal interests
Coffee
Neelix pours Janeway a cup of his "better than coffee substitute"
Janeway was well known for her love of coffee. She refused to go a day without it and preferred it completely black, without milk or sugar. When energy reserves were low and the use of replicators was discouraged, she tried to give up coffee by drinking Neelix's "even better than coffee substitute", but to no avail; the beverage had a thick, molasses-like consistency that Janeway found more than distasteful. She was relieved when the bridge called her just before Neelix was finished pouring it. (VOY: "The Cloud")

In an alternate timeline, Janeway gave up coffee in favor of tea later in life. When she came back to help Voyager return home and regained her idealism, Admiral Janeway returned to drinking coffee and told her younger self she had no idea why she had ever given it up. (VOY: "Endgame")

The 23rd century
Janeway once expressed a desire to serve in the 23rd century, alongside Captain Kirk and his crew. While she believed their conduct would have been unacceptable in contemporary Starfleet, she said she would have enjoyed being with them in an era when space seemed "a whole lot bigger." (VOY: "Flashback")

Sciences
Janeway maintained her passion for science during her captaincy, and the Delta Quadrant provided ample wonders. She enjoyed exploring unfamiliar spatial phenomena and believed that some risk was acceptable for the sake of knowledge. She made a detailed exploration of an astral eddy and collected data on a binary pulsar, although the latter instance was hampered by Srivani experimentation. (VOY: "Real Life", "Scientific Method") Janeway's background in science and engineering allowed her to quickly grasp the implications or potential of spatial phenomena and discuss it on a level with her crew. Although she sometimes had to suspend her scientific mindset, she did use it to reason out seemingly supernatural phenomena. (VOY: "Parallax", "Sacred Ground", "Coda")

Holodeck
Janeway was an avid user of Voyager''s holodeck. She enjoyed a Gothic holonovel in the first year of the voyage home and later recreated Leonardo da Vinci's workshop, casting herself as the inventor's apprentice. (VOY: "Cathexis", "Scorpion") Her adventures with Leonardo da Vinci left the holodeck when a thief named Tau stole The Doctor's mobile emitter and inadvertently downloaded da Vinci's program into it. (VOY: "Concerning Flight") The setting was also used by The Doctor as a refuge from the Srivani. (VOY: "Scientific Method") Later, Janeway crafted a romantic interest for herself by modifying a character in Paris' Fair Haven holoprogram. (VOY: "Fair Haven")

Personality
As a captain, Janeway was very committed to Starfleet protocol, resisting the urge to bend or break the Prime Directive throughout Voyager's trip back to Earth through the Delta Quadrant, despite the fact that she was decades from Starfleet Command and could have simply broken the rules and lied about it in her records. While she recognized the potential dangers of this attitude, she refused to compromise on matters of principle. However, she often took action to help any species they encountered where Voyager could offer assistance without breaking the rules, such as investigating mysterious asteroid "assaults" or helping damaged ships conduct repairs without providing any of their "allies" with advanced technology (VOY: "Alliances", "Rise", "The Disease") The only exception Janeway made towards breaking the Prime Directive was when it got in the way of their journey home, particularly when it came towards entering other species territory in the Delta Quadrant in stead of going around it, which would extend their journey by months or even years.

Following the rules also extended to handling her responsibilities with her subordinates. When Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres disagreed on unnecessary genetic modifications for their unborn daughter, they went to her for a command ruling. Janeway came to the conclusion that the problem was not ethical, but marital. She also stressed that, while she was willing to give advice as a friend, she would not make any orders of any kind as to a decision, as it would be highly inappropriate for a captain to do so. (VOY: "Lineage")

While Janeway was a skilled commander, her habit of becoming fixated on her central goals could sometimes compromise her judgment. A key example of this included her vendetta against Captain Rudolph Ransom and the crew of the USS Equinox when she discovered the lengths that his crew had gone to while trying to get home, threatening Equinox crewmember Noah Lessing and ordering Chakotay confined to quarters when he questioned her decisions. (VOY: "Equinox") This personality trait was shown at its most extreme in the alternate timeline caused by the Krenim weapon ship, when Janeway kept the crew together until Voyager had lost nine decks, despite being presented with a reasonable argument that splitting up might be safer, and kept pushing herself to the point of physical and psychological damage. (VOY: "Year of Hell") As another example, her Silver Blood duplicate attempted to continue their journey to Earth even after learning their true natures until it became clear that this was impossible, too late to prevent the crew disintegrating while trying to return to a safe environment. (VOY: "Course: Oblivion")

Janeway could sometimes be brusque, moving crew out of the way with the wave of a hand or nod of her head. Her detractors - and even herself from an alternative future - characterized her as self-righteous and stubborn, perhaps impulsive. She was also very tender and caring, giving time to her crew, even when off duty, checking in on them when she knew they might need support. Many of the crew felt they could approach her directly with concerns or requests, even when she was off duty. She took a maternal role towards her crew, and especially so with certain individuals like Kes and Seven of Nine. (VOY: "The Raven", "Hope and Fear", "Latent Image", "Barge of the Dead", "The Void", and more)

Janeway could become depressive and carried guilt with her for some of her actions towards the people under her. This could cause her to want to atone for these actions, even at great risk to herself. (VOY: "Night") She was brave, a great tactician and had a scientific mind. (VOY: "Night", "Parallax", "Real Life", "Unimatrix Zero", "Endgame")

Personal relationships
Friends
Tuvok
Janeway and Tuvok in the mess hall
The first time Janeway met Tuvok, he dressed her down in front of three Starfleet admirals for failing to observe proper tactical procedure during her first command. Even though her ego took some bruising, Janeway knew that he was right. (VOY: "Revulsion")

Tuvok became one of Kathryn Janeway's closest as well as most trusted friends and advisers. She often sought out his advice and counted on him when she needed her moral compass checked. They had known each other for nearly twenty years (citation needed • edit), served on three starships together and she was present at his daughter's Kolinahr. Janeway was also one of the few people who knew Tuvok's birthday, and in 2376, she replicated a birthday cake for him. Tuvok regarded Janeway with the same esteem, and over the years, they forged a friendship based on trust and deep respect for the other. (VOY: "Prime Factors", "Fury")

Unlike with Chakotay, Janeway and Tuvok had a less tumultuous relationship. Almost without exception, Tuvok always respected Janeway's decisions, including her decision to make Chakotay first officer over him. (VOY: "Caretaker", "Prime Factors", "Twisted") When, in 2371, Tuvok – along with several other crew members – disobeyed her orders regarding acquiring classified technology from the Sikarians that could have gotten them home faster, Janeway felt betrayed, disappointed and saddened at Tuvok's behavior. Even though Tuvok reassured her that he acted out of logic, believing he had to acquire the technology on her behalf as she was not morally able to violate the Prime Directive like that, she reminded him of the strong relationship they had spent years forging and asked him to bring his logic to her the next time instead of just acting on it. She emphasized once again how much she needed to be able to rely on him. (VOY: "Prime Factors")

In 2372, Tuvok and Neelix were merged into a single being, Tuvix, after a transporter accident. The new hybrid quickly became popular among the crew, including Janeway. When The Doctor was finally able to devise a method to separate the two again, Tuvix refused – calling their plan an execution. Janeway was faced with a moral dilemma, as saving Tuvix would have meant sacrificing Neelix and Tuvok. Realizing that both men had loved ones waiting for them and how much she in fact missed Tuvok's friendship and guidance, she took it upon herself to make sure that the separation took place – despite opposition by The Doctor – and confirmed that both his protest and her actions would be in the official records. (VOY: "Tuvix")

When she commended him (in 2374) for his outstanding service as chief tactical and security officer and promoted him to the rank of lieutenant commander, Janeway expressed her appreciation for Tuvok, remarking how she had come to rely on his insightful and unfailingly logical advice over the years. (VOY: "Revulsion")

Admiral Janeway's gift to Tuvok shortly before her departure
One of the reasons Admiral Janeway from an alternate timeline wanted to change the outcome she had witnessed in her own timeline was to help her friend Tuvok. In that timeline, Voyager had returned home from the Delta Quadrant after a twenty-three-year journey, instead of a seven-year one. Tuvok's declining mental state could not be treated, due to his return home aboard Voyager having been too late for him to receive proper treatment, which would have required a blood-relative. In this alternate timeline, he suffered severe mental damage and lived in a mental hospital. However, due to the intervention of Admiral Janeway from this same alternate timeline, Tuvok arrived back in the Alpha Quadrant with the rest of the Voyager crew in time to receive his treatment. (VOY: "Endgame")

Chakotay
Janeway and Chakotay
Janeway's relationship with Chakotay was complicated. Chakotay started out as an enemy and a compulsory shipmate. As they got to know one another, he became a possible romantic interest, and finally her close friend and confidant. (VOY: "Renaissance Man")

Chakotay was the leader of a Maquis cell that Janeway was sent to apprehend. When both of their ships were transported to the Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker, Chakotay and Janeway became reluctant allies in the attempt to find missing crew members and return to the Alpha Quadrant. After the array and Chakotay's ship were destroyed in a battle with the Kazon, the crews integrated, and Chakotay became Janeway's first officer.

Janeway liked the idea that Chakotay not only had the technical qualifications with command experience but that he also was a graduate of the Academy, something which could not be said of most of his crew of outlaws and malcontents. Chakotay did not want to be her token Maquis, however, and while he embraced Starfleet ways once again and promised the captain his allegiance, he also stood up for his former crew and made sure they were treated fairly. (VOY: "Caretaker")

After some rough patches in the beginning, such as the time Chakotay pushed for her to give B'Elanna Torres the post of chief engineer – despite Torres' unprofessional and rebellious attitude – Janeway soon began to trust Chakotay and admired him for his integrity and fair handling of the crews of Voyager and the Maquis. He eventually became one of her most trusted officers and friends, and she remarked once how she could not imagine a day without him. (VOY: "Parallax", "Learning Curve", "Scorpion") She often relied on Chakotay's innovative tactics in the battle with the Kazon, and she integrated many Maquis tactical and procedural techniques in various battles.

Janeway and Chakotay on New Earth
Janeway once told Chakotay that, as the captain, she did not have the luxury of getting involved with anyone on board the ship – no matter how long the journey. She went on to say that she intended to return home before her fiancé gave her up for dead. (VOY: " Elogium") A budding romance seemed to emerge between the two when they were forced to remain behind on a deserted planet because of an incurable virus that was only contained by the environment of that planet. They had no choice but to remain there and make their home "New Earth", which is what they decided to call the planet. While Janeway was not ready to give up yet and immediately began to search for a cure, Chakotay came to terms with their situation and worked to make their new home a better place – even building her a bathtub and working on a boat. They also dropped the formalities, and Janeway suggested that he call her "Kathryn". Both felt a certain attraction to one another, and outside of a command structure, a romantic involvement suddenly seemed less inappropriate. Yet, both were hesitant to take their relationship a step further.

Chakotay gets personal with the captain
One night after a long day of work, Chakotay gave an exhausted and sore Janeway a neck massage, stating he had had a lot of practice in his younger years because of his mother's own neck problems. Janeway greatly enjoyed the opportunity to unwind until she realized that their actions might be inappropriate. They separated, but the issue gnawed on their minds, preventing sleep. Eventually, Janeway broached the subject and said they needed to "define parameters" for both their sakes. However, Chakotay responded that he wasn't certain if he could. So, instead, he told her about an ancient legend among his people – about an angry warrior who couldn't find peace even with the help of his spirit guide. For years, he struggled with his discontent until, one day, he and his war party were captured by a neighboring tribe led by a woman warrior. She called on him to join her because her tribe was too small and weak to defend itself from all its enemies. They fought many battles together and the angry warrior swore to himself that he would stay by her side, doing whatever he could to make her burden lighter. From that point on, her needs would come first. In that way, the warrior began to know the true meaning of peace. While listening to this story, Janeway realized that Chakotay was talking about himself – that it was their story – and both came, silently, to an understanding. When a cure for their condition was eventually found, they returned to Voyager and resumed their professional and cordial relationship, leaving everything they had said to each other behind on the planet. (VOY: "Resolutions") A romance between the two was never directly explored again. (citation needed • edit)

Janeway concerned about Chakotay's health
Over time, Chakotay, next to Tuvok, became one of Janeway's most trusted advisers and close friends, although they did not always see eye-to-eye. This was evident on several occasions where both passionately disagreed over command decisions. One of their most serious conflicts occurred when Voyager encountered the USS Equinox, which was captained by Starfleet officer Rudy Ransom. They found out that Ransom and his crew had been using sentient beings as fuel for their ship. Janeway was furious to see a Starfleet officer having behaved like that and set out for a relentless hunt of the Equinox. Her drive to bring Ransom and his crew to justice quickly turned to an obsession, and on more than one occasion, she compromised the safety of the ship for the pursuit. She even went so far as to lock one of Ransom's crew members in the cargo bay and threatened to unleash one of the alien beings, unless he told her where Ransom was. Chakotay was able to stop just in the nick of time, telling her that she was crossing the line. Blinded by her desire to catch Ransom, Janeway relieved Chakotay from duty. After they caught Ransom and she came back to her senses, she realized that she had gone too far and that Chakotay had had reason to stage a mutiny against her if he had wanted to. However, she was glad that he had never crossed the line like she had done. (VOY: "Equinox", "Equinox, Part II")

During another occasion involving the Borg, Chakotay strongly discouraged Janeway to strike an alliance with such an unscrupulous entity. He was also against her aiding genocide on one of their enemies, Species 8472, thus equipping them with a powerful weapon, just so Voyager could get home faster. Janeway was not to reason with, however, and she insisted on striking a deal with the Borg in exchange for safe passage through their space. After a lot of fighting over what constituted the right course, both finally realized that fighting each other wasn't going to help them get through this. They subsequently set their differences aside and worked together, even though Chakotay stood by his assertion that Janeway was making a grave mistake. Nevertheless, his objections ended up inspiring a backup plan between the two, in case the Borg turned on them; this ended up saving the crew. (VOY: "Scorpion", "Scorpion, Part II")

Over the course of their journey, Janeway and Chakotay grew as friends and colleagues, each coming to respect and admire the other. Janeway once stated that there was no crew member she trusted more than Chakotay. (VOY: "The Voyager Conspiracy") With the passage of time, both Starfleet and Maquis had bonded and grown as one Starfleet crew. Thus, Janeway was rather displeased when Starfleet referred to Chakotay and half of her crew as "Maquis", unaware of the unity and trust that now existed between the former adversaries. (VOY: "Life Line")

Seven of Nine
After rescuing Seven from the Borg, Janeway developed a very complex relationship with her. She was determined to help the ex-Borg to adjust to life on Voyager and regain her lost Human identity. Against the advice of her senior officers who wished to return her to the Borg Collective with her memory wiped, Janeway was unwilling to return Seven to the Borg and instead tried to rehabilitate her. Even when Seven demanded to return to the Collective as she wished for her connection to be restored, Janeway denied her request and instead tried to appeal to her humanity. Gradually, Seven rediscovered her Humanity with Janeway as her mentor and role model.

Janeway frequently worked with Seven to teach her the concepts of human interactions and to help her find a place with the crew. When Seven wished to be assigned duty position aboard Voyager, Janeway accepted her request to be assigned to engineering, though Seven's disagreeable and cold personality ended with her butting heads with B'Elanna Torres. She was eventually assigned to astrometric though still had trouble interacting with the crew despite Janeway's help and had a more difficult time of understanding the Prime Directive. Janeway initially overlooked this behavior at first as Seven was not familiar with Starfleet rules and protocols until Seven had disobeyed her orders by allowing a wounded member of Species 8472 to be captured by a Hirogen hunting party. Janeway then punished Seven by having her confined to her quarters and duty station and forbade her from accessing any of the ship's systems without her knowledge. They eventually moved past the incident and gradually became friends.

Janeway and Seven played a game of Velocity together. (VOY: "Hope and Fear", "Renaissance Man")

The Doctor
The Doctor examines Janeway
Janeway initially shared her crew's frustration with the Doctor's rude demeanor and considered having him reprogrammed. It wasn't until Kes brought her concerns of the crew's treatment of the Doctor to Janeway that the latter considered him to be treated any better than the rest of the crew. She went down to ask if he had any concerns or needs to be addressed, one of which was his frustration that the other crew members had either left him on or turned him off, later giving his program control of that function in his programming. As the crew's journey unfolded, Janeway soon found herself becoming friends with The Doctor. The two of them became closer, particularly when they were the only crewmembers standing between Voyager and the macrovirus that was attacking the ship. (VOY: "Macrocosm")

Over time, their friendship and mutual respect grew, with The Doctor often coming to Janeway when he needed personal advice or information about how his program was developing, as well as consolation about any wrong decisions he had made in recent times. It was Janeway who stopped The Doctor from deleting the additional subroutines that made him unique when he felt responsible for the death of an innocent man, (VOY: "Retrospect") Janeway who assured The Doctor that none of the crew thought any less of him when he was embarrassed about the fantasies created by his dream program, (VOY: "Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy") and Janeway who told The Doctor that none of the crew blamed him for betraying them to help a crew of holograms. (VOY: "Flesh and Blood") In addition, when Janeway faced death after being captured by an alien species, The Doctor risked everything to save her. (VOY: "Renaissance Man")

Tom Paris
Chakotay once remarked that Tom Paris was Janeway's personal reclamation project. At a time where no one wanted anything to do with Tom, she approached him and offered him a second chance at redeeming himself by joining her on the mission to the Badlands to retrieve the Maquis ship with her security officer on board. Janeway was aware of Tom's exceptional piloting skills and gave him a chance to join her on the mission as a Starfleet observer.

Tom was reluctant but he accepted the offer. After the Caretaker's array was destroyed and the crew permanently stranded in the Delta Quadrant, Janeway, recognizing Tom's hard work and bravery, granted him the field commission of lieutenant for his exceptional accomplishments during their battle with the Kazon. For the first time in his life, Tom didn't know what to say, determined to not disappoint the captain after the faith she had demonstrated in him. (VOY: "Caretaker")

When Tom was caught by Chakotay during his gambling operation in Sandrine's, he reminded him that the captain had put a lot of faith in him and that she would be disappointed to find out about his recent conduct. Even though Paris' insubordination and lack of discipline were part of a larger plot to expose a traitor among the crew, everyone understood the importance of the faith she had placed in him. (VOY: "Lifesigns", "Meld")

Janeway disciplines Tom
Only once, during their journey, did Janeway seriously punish Paris. This happened in 2375, when he disobeyed her direct orders not to interfere with the affairs of the Moneans. He was demoted to the rank of ensign and sentenced to thirty days in solitary confinement in the brig. Janeway was gravely disappointed in Tom's conduct, which she believed was something he had finally grown past. She reminded him of the fresh start she had given him, four years earlier. Tom admitted that, even though he had never been very good at playing by the rules, it did not mean that serving under her command hadn't changed him for the better. Even though he regretted having let down Janeway, he felt proud because, this time, he had broken the rules for something he believed in. (VOY: "Thirty Days") A year later, Janeway reinstated him to the rank of lieutenant junior grade as an award for his exemplary performance and expected more of the same from him. (VOY: "Unimatrix Zero")

Janeway was a central figure in Tom Paris' personal and professional journey on board Voyager by helping him change for the better and grow into a responsible officer who performed with integrity.

Harry Kim
Janeway and Kim talking in the mess hall in 2371
Janeway felt differently about Harry Kim than about the other officers and crewmen under her command. He came to her fresh from the Academy, and she was very protective of him. (VOY: "The Disease") Kim exceeded all of Janeway's expectations and she considered him "one of the bright spots of this whole mission." (VOY: "Twisted") He continued to exceed her expectations to the point where she let him have command experience of Voyager, such as managing the night shift twice a week. Although normally his performance on Voyager would have meant he would rise up the ranks fairly quickly, Janeway could never promote Kim. As he pointed out to his parents, "it's a small ship. There are only so many command positions available." (VOY: "Author, Author")

The only time when Janeway and Kim ever came into serious conflict was when Kim had an intimate relationship with a Varro scientist called "Derran Tal". This was a violation of Starfleet regulations, which brought Janeway and Kim into serious conflict. Kim, under the influence of alien hormones, actively defied her orders more than once and then engaged in a heated argument with her over his feelings for Tal. Although their relationship was temporarily strained, Kim (with help) managed to break free of the influence of the hormones. (VOY: "The Disease") After this, Janeway and Kim's relationship very quickly returned to normal. Kim continued to serve well aboard Voyager to the point where Janeway once humorously warned Chakotay, "You'd better watch out for your job, commander." (VOY: "Dragon's Teeth")

Janeway was a central influence on Kim's emotional well-being in the Delta Quadrant. Feeling insecure because he was "the baby of the crew," he looked up to Janeway as something of a mother figure, for comfort and guidance. (VOY: "The Thaw") Janeway, in turn, was there for him whenever he needed guidance and comfort after missions that had tested his abilities to the limit. (VOY: "Emanations", "Timeless") In turn, he remained immensely loyal to her and obeyed her orders to the best of his ability.

Kes
Janeway displayed a particular fondness for Kes. They were able to talk freely and deeply together. When Kes locked herself in The Doctor's office, frightened and confused by the early onset of the Ocampa elogium, she allowed only Janeway to enter. Kes explained to her what was happening, and Janeway comforted her. (VOY: "Elogium")

Towards the end of 2372, Janeway supported Kes when she was struggling to cope with the loss of Neelix and his replacement by Tuvix, a fusion of Neelix and Tuvok caused by a transporter accident. Janeway was available to comfort and give advice to Kes late at night, receiving her although she (Janeway) was in her nightgown. At that time, she found herself sharing a confidence with Kes: about how much she missed Mark Johnson. She told Kes, "My door is always open for you, Kes." Later, she received Kes in her ready room and comforted her as Kes wept. (VOY: "Tuvix")

Kes requested temporary leave to travel with Zahir, a Mikhal Traveler. Janeway advised Kes to think about it for another day, but she was supportive of Kes' desire to have variety and "complications" in her limited lifespan. (VOY: "Darkling") Ultimately, Kes decided to decline Zahir's invitation.

Kes told Janeway that she was evolving into a higher plane of existence and had to leave Voyager to prevent any further damage to the ship (her new-found mental powers were causing problems in the structural integrity field). In response, Janeway said, "Oh, I am going to miss you." (VOY: "The Gift")

Admiral Patterson
Admiral Patterson
Admiral Patterson was Janeway's favorite teacher at Starfleet Academy. He became her mentor and a parental figure to her, especially since her father had died when she was young. Patterson treated her like his own daughter.

He helped get her the assignment on Voyager, and gave her the first tour of the ship. (VOY: "Relativity")


Romance
Mark Johnson
Janeway and Mark Johnson with their dog
At the time Janeway was commissioned as captain of Voyager, she was engaged to Mark Johnson. Shortly before her departure to the Badlands, she discussed the fate of her pregnant dog with Mark. In 2374, when Voyager had begun communication with Starfleet in the Alpha Quadrant, Janeway received a letter from Johnson telling her that, having held out hope longer than most, he had eventually believed her dead after Voyager was lost in the Delta Quadrant and that he had met another woman whom he had just married recently. This news was rather unexpected for Janeway, but it was also the jolt she needed to finally move on with her life and stop hiding behind their relationship. (VOY: "Caretaker", "Hunters")

Kashyk
Janeway kisses Kashyk before he leaves Voyager
After the infamous "Dear John" letter she received from her fiancé Mark Johnson informing her of his marriage, Janeway shyly began pursuing romance again. During the incident with the Devore Imperium, Janeway became attracted to Kashyk, the Devore inspector who pretended to defect to Voyager. Even though she wasn't sure about him, she did give him the benefit of the doubt, and at one point, even offered him to join Voyager. It was rather atypical for her to begin a romance with a former alien enemy, but they passionately kissed before his departure. When Kashyk showed his true face, she was prepared, albeit disappointed. Before Kashyk left, she told him that her offer to take him with them was genuine and that it would still stand if he had kept his part of the bargain. He told her that, for what it was worth, she made a tempting offer, and even though his assistant wanted Voyager confiscated and its crew sent to a detention center, Kashyk ordered him to drop the matter and pretend that this incident never happened. (VOY: "Counterpoint")

Michael Sullivan
In the program Fair Haven that was created by Tom Paris, Janeway became attracted to one of the male characters, Michael Sullivan, and even went so far as to alter his appearance and personality subroutines so he conformed more to her standards. Sullivan originated as a simple, married man, but she modified his program parameters so that he was single, well versed in literature, in addition to enjoying long, intellectual debates. Although a romance ensued, Janeway ended it, because she wasn't sure how she felt about a relationship with a hologram. (VOY: "Fair Haven", "Spirit Folk")

Jaffen
Janeway with Jaffen
In 2377, the entire Voyager crew was captured and their memories modified so they could join the workforce at a power distribution center on Quarra. There, Janeway met a Norvalen engineer called "Jaffen" and fell in love with him. After two weeks, she even moved in with him. When she regained her memory, Janeway said that, even though she could always use a skilled engineer on Voyager, him joining them wouldn't be appropriate as they were romantically involved. Once again unable to pursue a relationship with someone because of her responsibilities, Janeway left Jaffen behind, stating that she would never forget the time they had spent together. (VOY: "Workforce", "Workforce, Part II")

Memorable quotes
"In a part of space where there are few rules, it's more important than ever that we hold fast to our own. In a region where shifting allegiances are commonplace, we have to have something stable to rely on. And we do... The principles and ideals of the Federation. As far as I'm concerned, those are the best allies we could have."


"We're Starfleet officers. Weird is part of the job."



"Space must have seemed a whole lot bigger back then. It's not surprising they had to bend the rules a little. They were a little slower to invoke the Prime Directive and a little quicker to pull their phasers. Of course, the whole bunch of them would be booted out of Starfleet today, but I have to admit, I would have loved to ride shotgun at least once with a group of officers like that."


"Dismissed. That's a Starfleet expression for 'get out'."


"You and I know that fear only exists for one purpose: to be conquered"


"Abandon ship? The answer's 'no.' I'm not breaking up the family, Chakotay. We're stronger as a team."


"This ship has been our home. It's kept us together. It's been part of our family. As illogical as this might sound, I feel as close to Voyager as I do to any other member of my crew. It's carried us, Tuvok, even nurtured us. And right now, it needs one of us. "


"There are three things to remember about being a starship captain: keep your shirt tucked in, go down with the ship, and never abandon a member of your crew."


"It's never easy, but if we turn our backs on our principles, we stop being Human."


"The Son'a, the Borg, the Romulans... You seem to get all the easy assignments."

Janeway's coffee quotes
A replicator replicates the mug after the coffee
"Coffee, black."


"Just... coffee."


"There's coffee in that nebula!"


"I'm just going to have to give up coffee, that's all there is to it."


"Coffee: the finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it."


"One more cup [of coffee] and I'll jump to warp."


"You ought to try it one day. Keeps you sharp."


"It's an acquired taste."


"Coffee, black."
"Make it yourself."


"I don't know why I ever gave this up."


"Listen carefully, because I'm only going to say this once. Coffee, black."

Alternate Kathryn Janeways
Biomimetic duplicate
In 2374, Voyager landed on a demon-class planet rich in deuterium sources. The planet was filled with silver fluid with mimetic properties. The "Silver Blood" sampled the crew's DNA and created duplicates with identical memories and personalities but with the ability to survive on the planet. The "Silver Blood" would not let Voyager leave unless it could duplicate the rest of the ship's crew, to populate the planet. Captain Janeway, understanding that this was their only way out, allowed the "Silver Blood" to duplicate the crew. (VOY: "Demon")

In 2375, this duplicate crew – unaware that it was a facsimile of the original Voyager crew – had managed to recreate Voyager and begun their own trip to the Alpha Quadrant, but began suddenly dying one-by-one due to warp drive radiation caused by an enhanced warp drive they had developed. Even after finding out their true identities, the Janeway duplicate attempted to continue their mission to get back to Earth, too caught up in the original quest for "home" to think about stopping, but the death of Chakotay's duplicate forced her to recognize that she was being irrational. They set a course back to the demon-class planet, but everyone, including the duplicate Janeway, died before the ship could reach home. (VOY: "Course: Oblivion")

Holograms
Kathryn Janeway was holographically duplicated on a number of occasions.

Recreations of crew members from Voyager and the Jupiter Station Holoprogramming Center were seen by The Doctor during a holographic malfunction in 2371. This simulation or daydream included Janeway, apparently part of a program created by "Lewis Zimmerman". (VOY: "Projections")
A holographic Janeway was used to fool The Clown in Viorsa's species' artificial hibernation program, created to interact with The Clown as Janeway would while preventing the real Janeway from having to actually enter the program herself. (VOY: "The Thaw")
The entire crew of Voyager was recreated by Tuvok for his Insurrection Alpha program, Janeway initially away on a mission with Tom Paris before returning to try and retake the ship. (VOY: "Worst Case Scenario")
The Kyrian Museum of Heritage in the 31st century used the program The Voyager Encounter to detail their encounter with the warship Voyager, as an aid to a history lesson. In this version, Janeway was a darker character, willing to use force and murder to make her point, although the Doctor later recreated the "true" Janeway to explain what had really happened. (VOY: "Living Witness")
In 2374, The Doctor recreated the crew of Voyager, including Janeway, to help Seven of Nine improve her social skills. (VOY: "One")
The Doctor took a holographic image, down to the subatomic level, of Captain Janeway deleting his memory in 2375. (VOY: "Latent Image")
Lieutenant Barclay recreated most of the crew of the USS Voyager at the Communications Research Center on Earth for the Pathfinder Project in 2376. (VOY: "Pathfinder")
Also that year, Ensign Harry Kim and Seven of Nine projected The Doctor's daydreams into the holodeck aboard Voyager in order to better understand what was malfunctioning. In one such daydream, The Doctor acted as the Emergency Command Hologram after Captain Janeway was incapacitated. (VOY: "Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy")
In 2378, Seven recreated the crew of Voyager to perfect her social skills, including Janeway. (VOY: "Human Error")
The Doctor's holonovel Photons Be Free was set aboard the USS Vortex and crewed by characters based on the crew of the USS Voyager, albeit the names were changed to protect the innocent. The character of Jenkins was based on Janeway but was far colder and more brutal, once killing one of her crew so that the novel's protagonist would focus on treating her less injured pilot over the more seriously injured man. (VOY: "Author, Author")
The Doctor was forced to impersonate members of Voyager's crew during a crisis in 2378. One of them he impersonated was Janeway. (VOY: "Renaissance Man")
Alternate realities and timelines
In an alternate timeline experienced by Kes, Captain Janeway was killed during the first encounter between the USS Voyager and the Krenim in 2374, requiring Chakotay to take command. (VOY: "Before and After")

In another alternate timeline, Janeway engaged the Krenim, during a year in which the USS Voyager was wrecked nearly beyond repair. This devastating year pushed Janeway to her psychological limits – to the point where she was only still in command because there was nowhere to contain her for treatment, as the ship fell apart around them. Afterward, Janeway rammed Voyager into the Krenim temporal ship, restoring the primary timeline. (VOY: "Year of Hell")

In a different alternate timeline, Voyager used a quantum slipstream drive in 2375 but crash-landed on an arctic planet. Janeway was killed when the vessel crash-landed, as was the rest of the crew except for Harry Kim and Chakotay, who had survived the trip in the Delta Flyer. Fifteen years later, they found Voyager and "fixed" history. (VOY: "Timeless")

In a timeline in 2377 in which Voyager was split into 37 different timeframes, the Chakotay of the original timeframe encountered a Janeway from shortly before Voyager ventured into the Delta Quadrant. He injected her with a chroniton infused serum so that she could travel freely aboard the vessel and enlisted her help in resolving the situation. She became troubled by what she learned of Voyager's future and suggested preventing Voyager from ever being sent into the Delta Quadrant in the first place, but Chakotay told her that it was presumptuous to think that she had the right to change everyone's future. (VOY: "Shattered")
