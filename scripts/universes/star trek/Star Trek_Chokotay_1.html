Early life and family
A young Chakotay with his father Kolopak
Chakotay was born in 2329 on a Federation colony near the Cardassian Demilitarized Zone that his native tribe had moved to several generations earlier. Here, he was raised by his father, Kolopak, who considered him a "contrary" from the beginning because he had come out of his mother "upside down", as his father once remarked. (VOY: "Tattoo", "Endgame") 

Chakotay also had a sister and a cousin who lived in Ohio. (VOY: "Author, Author", "Message in a Bottle") During an incident in 2373 that took Voyager to Earth in 1996, Chakotay considered "looking up" a few of his ancestors, noting that he knew of one ancestor at that time who worked as a school teacher in Arizona. (VOY: "Future's End") 

One of Chakotay's early ancestors was Ce Acatl, a man who was fathered by a white conqueror when they first took over Chakotay's tribe's native lands on Earth. (VOY: "Basics, Part I")

Being of Native American descent, Chakotay's tribe – mainly because of the intrusion of more technological societies – left Earth to find their own home on another planet near the Cardassian border. From an early age, his father tried to impart his values on Chakotay in many ways, such as taking him on hikes to nearby forested worlds of their ancestors. In 2344 he took Chakotay on a quest through the Central American rainforest, looking for their fellow descendants of the ancient Rubber Tree People that had never left the forest.

As a young man, Chakotay was rather resistant to his family's way of life and in a technologically advanced world often felt out of place among the members of his tribe who asserted a strong connection to their ancestral lands and spirits and lived a simple life. Chakotay dismissed his tribe that he believed lived in the past of fantasy and myth. He did not want to be part of that and instead wanted to be like all the other tribes that had embraced the 24th century. When his father would take him on expeditions to discover his roots and connection to the "sky spirits", Chakotay remained a reluctant participant, even ridiculing the sky spirits once by suggesting they had "taken a wrong turn" somewhere. (VOY: "Tattoo") 

Chakotay also refused to hunt deer with his father. (VOY: "Waking Moments")

Kolopak tried to teach Chakotay that without Spirits to guide him, he would lose his way. But Chakotay did not want to listen as he did not place much value in spirituality. He remained resistant, instead choosing to embrace technological advancement, believing that he was the master of his own life. One of Chakotay's childhood heroes was astronaut John Kelly. (VOY: "One Small Step") 

While initially somewhat disappointed in his son's lack of interest in the culture and traditions of their tribe, Kolopak remained patient with Chakotay and, due to his son's curiosity, allowed him to read about other societies as he was growing up. He did so because he strongly believed that ignorance is one's greatest enemy. (VOY: "Tattoo", "Waking Moments")

However, by the time Chakotay was fifteen years old, he had already set his sights on Starfleet and greatly surprised his father when he told him that he was going to leave the tribe to attend Starfleet Academy. His father disapproved of his son's decision but was unable to convince him otherwise. (VOY: "Tattoo")

Chakotay performs the Pakra
Chakotay and his father were not on good terms when Kolopak was killed while defending his colony against Cardassians. When the news reached Chakotay, he was unsure about how to reconcile their differences and heal their old wounds. To honor his father's memory and to continue the fight in his name, Chakotay resigned from Starfleet and joined the Maquis. It was then that he took the mark, the tattoo, on his forehead in order to honor the memory of his father and to signify his Native American heritage. (VOY: "Tattoo") 

In the years following his resignation from Starfleet, he not only joined the Maquis to fight the Cardassians but he also finally began placing great faith in his spiritual background by taking pride in the stories and accomplishments of his people. He often embarked on vision quests to help guide his life and to commune with his father's spirit. He also used a medicine wheel to heal himself both spiritually and physically. (VOY: "The Cloud", "Basics, Part I", "Cathexis")

The Pakra was the name of the solitary ritual by which Chakotay commemorated the anniversary of Kolopak's death. On stardate 49005.3, Captain Janeway granted him the use of a shuttlecraft so he could perform the ritual in private. (VOY: "Initiations")

When Chakotay was young, he looked after his grandfather, who suffered from hallucinations caused by an inherited defective gene. This gene was suppressed in Chakotay before birth, although it was activated for a brief period in 2375 by aliens who attempted to make contact with the crew of Voyager. (VOY: "The Fight")

Starfleet Academy
At the age of fifteen, Chakotay entered Starfleet Academy, sponsored by Captain Sulu. Chakotay misled the officer into believing that he had Kolopak's permission to join. (VOY: "Tattoo")

Chakotay possessed great piloting skills and during his first year he trained as a pilot in North America. He then went to Venus for a couple of months to learn how to handle atmospheric storms and later dodged asteroids for a semester in the Sol system asteroid belt. (VOY: "Future's End, Part II")

He also became a proficient boxer at the light heavyweight level, with a record of twenty-three wins and one loss. The loss was to a Nausicaan boxer with "a mean right hook." B'Elanna Torres once jested "legend has it that 'The Tattooed Terror' has put more men in sickbay than the Ankaran flu." (VOY: "Tsunkatse") His personal trainer was Academy groundsman Boothby. (VOY: "The Fight")*

Starfleet officer
Chakotay graduated from Starfleet Academy in 2348. (VOY: "Endgame", "Tattoo", "Parallax") 

On his first starship posting, he served during the planned first contact with the Tarkannans. After spending a lot of time pushing his captain to let him be on the diplomatic team, he began studying everything about them. When he finally came face to face with their delegation, he very proudly made the traditional gesture for "hello", not realizing that males and females have different styles of movement when making such symbolic gestures. He later found out that he had actually propositioned the ambassador. He remembered this encounter and mentioned it to Captain Janeway when in 2372 they made first contact with the Drayans, noting that it almost got his sent back to the Academy for remedial training. (VOY: "Innocence")

On another assignment, he visited a tomb excavation on Ktaria VII on one of his earliest away missions. There, unaware of local custom, he – wanting to take a memento – stole a small stone from the burial. He was later informed that each stone represented a prayer and that he had desecrated the burial site. (VOY: "Emanations")

On another occasion, he beamed down to a planet and the pattern buffer malfunctioned, misreading his Starfleet uniform. When he rematerialized, all he had was his combadge. (VOY: "In the Flesh")

Once, while serving in Starfleet, he learned to communicate with a "Terrelian seapod"; something normally thought very difficult to communicate with. (VOY: "Equinox, Part II")

The Maquis
Chakotay aboard his Maquis raider Val Jean in 2371
After his father was killed in 2368 while defending their colony, Chakotay resisted the Cardassian takeover of his planet – as per the terms of the border treaty between Cardassia and the Federation. He refused to stand by and watch his people be displaced once again, as had happened on Earth hundreds of years ago. (VOY: "Tattoo") As such, he was one of the Maquis who were in the fight for principle, not mercenary gain or violent outlet. (VOY: "Caretaker", "Repression")

On March 3, 2368 he resigned from his position as an instructor in Starfleet's Advanced Tactical Training by submitting his resignation to Admiral Nimembeh. He was recruited in the Maquis by his old friend Sveta. (VOY: "In the Flesh", "Hunters")

After joining the Maquis, he became one of its leaders and his cell one of the most successful in resisting the Cardassians and Federation. His vessel, the Val Jean, was his primary mode of space transportation. (VOY: "Caretaker") Like captains of other ships, he would have conversation with his. (VOY: "The Haunting of Deck Twelve") Aside from his Val Jean crew, including Seska, B'Elanna Torres, Ayala, and many others; Chakotay had other Maquis friends, including Li-Paz, Sahreen, Meyer and Nelson. (VOY: "Extreme Risk")

Among their various missions as Maquis, included an instance when Chakotay, Torres, and Seska successfully disabled the computer core on a Cardassian frigate, orbiting Bajor. This was accomplished when Seska modified an antiproton beam to penetrate the frigate's shields and hull from an extremely close range. (VOY: "Maneuvers")

Around 2370, Chakotay encountered two Starfleet runabouts near Teluridian IV. Although outnumbered, the Val Jean was able to escape using the Maquis trick whereby they blew out the dorsal phase emitters and cut main power, making it look as if the ship was in serious trouble. (VOY: "Ex Post Facto")

While trying to escape from a Cardassian warship commanded by Gul Evek in the Badlands, Chakotay and his crew, including Tuvok – Captain Janeway's security chief working undercover as a Maquis – were transported to the Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker's array. In an attempt to locate the disappeared Maquis ship, USS Voyager followed them into the Badlands, becoming trapped 70,000 light years away in the Delta Quadrant shortly after. (VOY: "Caretaker")

USS Voyager
After having made contact with Voyager, and accepting the realization of being alone in an uncharted part of the galaxy, Chakotay agreed to cooperate with Janeway when both of their crews were abducted and subjected to medical testing by the Caretaker. The crewmembers were eventually found and the Caretaker's Array destroyed so it would not fall into the hands of the ruthless Kazon. 

In order to protect Voyager while it destroyed the Array, Chakotay crashed his ship into a Kazon carrier vessel.

Following the destruction of his ship in the Delta Quadrant, Chakotay and his crew joined Voyager's crew as one Starfleet crew in order to find a way home. He was granted the provisional rank of Commander and became Voyager's second in command. As first officer, he was in charge of all ship personnel and of protecting the captain, both roles which he threw himself into. A man of great moral conviction and courage, Chakotay embraced Starfleet principles once again and served Captain Janeway as first officer, forging a meaningful friendship with her; despite moments of strong disagreement, he was loyal to Janeway and the ship and helped keep the peace and establish cooperation and a positive rapport between the Maquis and the Starfleet crew. As the one responsible for the personnel, and as a friendly and approachable person, he was familiar with the crew and understood how they were feeling, more so than the captain. (VOY: "Caretaker", "The Cloud", "The 37's", "Day of Honor", "Course: Oblivion", "Shattered")

The first year (2371)
Chakotay shows Crewman Dalby how it's done "the Maquis way"
On appointment to First Officer, Chakotay was unsure if Janeway was using him as a "token" Maquis officer and confronts her about it while also advocating for his fellow Maquis members. However, his devotion to Voyager was strong, even though he never lost his sense of being Maquis: he even threatened to throw his Maquis crewmates Seska and Jarvin into the brig when they said they would support him in a mutiny against Janeway. When Tuvok wished to train a group of Maquis in order to bring them up to Starfleet standards, Chakotay forcefully persuaded them, after they initially resisted and wanted to do things "the Maquis way". (VOY: "Parallax", "Learning Curve", "Life Line", "Repression")

Chakotay was thrown into command of Voyager early on in his time as part of the crew when Janeway and Tom Paris become stuck a day in the past on a planet's surface. Chakotay had to command the ship and lead an away mission to find Janeway and Paris. In this command position, over the first few years Chakotay has a number of clashes with Tuvok, who had been spying on him in the Maquis and who would naturally have been Janeway's first officer under more usual circumstances. The two came to respect each other over the course of the years they serve together, however. (VOY: "Time and Again", "Twisted", "Night")

Despite his attempts to stay as neutral and objective as possible when it came to the merged crew, he sometimes felt the need to stand up for some of his former Maquis members, knowing that if he didn't stand up for them, no one else would. He, for example, recommended a hot-tempered B'Elanna Torres as chief engineer and was willing, against all odds, to give Seska the benefit of the doubt when she was accused of secretly collaborating with the enemy. (VOY: "Learning Curve", "Parallax", "State of Flux") His recommendation of and advocacy for Torres was a vital moment for Voyager, not only helping to integrate the two crews, but also providing the ship with a truly brilliant engineer. While Janeway needed convincing, she quickly recognised the wisdom in Chakotay's work, telling him within their first two months in the Delta Quadrant, "A good choice for Chief Engineer, if I do say so myself". (VOY: "Parallax", "Fury")

Chakotay confronts Seska
He also had his share of personal disappointments after joining Voyager: he found out that Tuvok was a Federation spy and actually Captain Janeway's security chief sent to infiltrate his crew, Seska, his lover, was revealed to be a Cardassian spy who, now in the Delta Quadrant, had also begun to secretly collaborate with and transfer Federation technology to the Kazon, and he had to deal with Tom Paris, a person he not only disliked, but whom he actually considered to be nothing but a mercenary willing to sell out to the highest bidder. The betrayal of Seska was particularly hard on him, not only because he had an intimate relationship with her, but also because he had personally vouched for her. Her betrayal of his trust angered and humiliated Chakotay. When he confronted her, she told him that she did it for him and the crew because their captain was a fool and incapable of getting them home. Shortly after, Seska escaped from the ship and joined Maje Culluh of the Kazon Nistrim. (VOY: "Caretaker", "State of Flux")

Chakotay's interests in anthropology and paleontology, and his respect for other cultures, is evident on a number of occasions during the voyage. They are revealed early on in the first year after an away mission uncovered that mineral deposits on an asteroid were part of decomposing remains in a burial site. Chakotay gathers a lot of information simply by observing closely, not wanting to show disrespect by even using passive tricorders scans. (VOY: "Emanations")

Chakotay quickly and naturally fell into the role of informal spiritual guide and counsel to a number of the crew, including Janeway, who he guides on a vision quest to find her animal guide during their first months together. (VOY: "The Cloud") In keeping with his character, this is understated role, something he is approached about or offers at appropriate times. (VOY: "The Cloud", "Mortal Coil")

His tactical and piloting skills were also required from early on on Voyager. In one instance, with the usual helmsman unavailable, Chakotay used Maquis tactics to disable attacking ships. He stated, "out here in the Delta quadrant, every old trick is new again" and indicated he had many tricks to use. He also devised a way of detecting a hidden ship using Voyager's phasers. (VOY: "Ex Post Facto", "Phage")

During their first year in the Delta Quadrant, Voyager met a number of hostile species, including the Vidiians, who harvest organs from other species to perpetuate their own. The Vidiians were considered, along with the Borg and Species 8472, the prime examples of species hostile to Voyager in the Delta Quadrant. (VOY: "Good Shepherd") During an ambush of Voyager within its first two months in the quadrant, Chakotay's Starfleet advanced tactical training combined with his Maquis ingenuity and tenacity saved the ship from being overwhelmed by the Vidiians, who had managed to attach a number of grapplers to Voyager's hull. Janeway absent from the bridge, Chakotay took charge and instructed Kim to reverse the hull's polarity in an effort to shake the grapplers off. Rerouting the deflector to discharge antigraviton pulses along the hull and engaging the inertial dampers started a controlled pitch of the ship and snapped a grappler off. Chakotay then ordered helm to reverse thrusters at full power, to resist the Vidiians deploying a tractor beam, despite objections from the crew that doing so could tear the hull apart. A section of the hull came away with a grappler but the ship was free and angled for an attack. Chakotay ordered a full spread of photon torpedoes to be fired at the Vidiian ship, neutralising the threat. (VOY: "Fury")

Another enemy Voyager faced in the first year were the Komar. Chakotay's shuttlecraft was attacked by the them during an away mission. After the attack, Chakotay was apparently rendered brain dead, forcing The Doctor to use artificial means to keep his body alive. In reality, however, his neural energy had been extracted, turning him into a disembodied spirit, while Tuvok – who had been in the shuttlecraft with him – was possessed by the Komar in an attempt to lure the crew into a nebula and steal their neural energy. Although Chakotay soon learned how to control others in order to prevent the crew being led into the trap, his actions were initially taken as being the actions of a hostile entity trying to sabotage the ship. However, Chakotay's presence was confirmed when he ejected the warp core after having occupied B'Elanna Torres' body: she lacked the authority to eject the core by herself, but, as first officer, Chakotay possessed the required command codes. With his presence confirmed, he subsequently used a medicine wheel, which that Torres had placed in sickbay next to his body, to provide the crew with a map out of the nebula. The Doctor later developed a treatment that returned his mind to his body. (VOY: "State of Flux", "Cathexis")

Another time, Chakotay, Kim and Tuvok were held hostage by a photonic lifeform because one of the lifeform's fellows was contained on Voyager for scientific tests. The crew are released when the lifeform is. (VOY: "Heroes and Demons")

Chakotay, undercover as a Vidiian
The first officer's bravery is demonstrated when, disguied as a Vidiian, one of Voyager's most feared enemies, he infiltrates a Vidiian labor camp and medical facility to rescue Torres and Paris. (VOY: "Faces")

The second year (2372)
Early on in the second year, Voyager visited a planet where Humans lived. The inhabitants invited any of Voyager's crew to stay with them. Both Janeway and Chakotay were saddened by the prospect that members of the crew might stay behind, and concerned about how hard it might become to run a starship with a diminished crew. Chakotay reassured Janeway, however, saying, "No matter what happens, we'll make it. Remember that". It turned out that not one crew member decided to stay on the planet. (VOY: "The 37's")

While honoring one of his tribal rituals, remembering the anniversary of his father's death, Chakotay's shuttlecraft was attacked by a young Kazon of the Ogla sect seeking to earn his Ogla name through killing. Chakotay outmaneuvered the Kazon and destroyed his ship before beaming the child to his own. The young Kazon, called Kar, was angry at Chakotay because being taken captive and either not being victorious or dying in battle were a disgrace. Chakotay's shuttlecraft was captured by Kar's sect's main ship and the Kazon-Ogla First Maje said Chakotay could go free if he killed Kar. Throughout his time with Kar, Chakotay had insisted that he wasn't interested in a fight or in killing people and he refused to kill Kar, instead taking the First Maje hostage and escaping with Kar's help. Chakotay continued to refuse to kill, ignoring Kar's information about how to destroy the Kazon ship, and Kar eventually realised that Chakotay wasn't his enemy. When the pair were eventually caught, Chakotay had devised a plan to enable Kar to return to his sect with honor: he told Kar to kill him and he would then be beamed to sickbay on Voyager where he would be resuscitated. In the moment, however, Kar, unwilling to kill Chakotay, killed the First Maje and regained his place in his sect. (VOY: "Initiations")

When The Doctor's program was damaged while he was in a holo simulation in the holodeck and he was experiencing delusions that were telling him he was really a Human trapped in a simulation on Jupiter Station, he was in danger of destroying his program by terminating the simulation. Chakotay was projected via a hologram into the simulation and tried to explain to The Doctor what was happening. Trying to convince him to terminate the simulation, his delusions asked him what he would rather be: a Human with a real life and family or a hologram trapped in a sickbay on a ship lost in deep space. Chakotay informed him that what he was made of didn't change who he was to the rest of the crew: he was their friend and no less real than anyone else. He manged to delay The Doctor long enough for the crew to work out how to free him from the simulation without terminating his program. (VOY: "Projections")

Chakotay's interest in anthropology became useful again when, during the second year, Voyager was attacked by a spaceborne alien of similar dimension to the ship. The alien saw Voyager as a mating rival. While Janeway is preparing to attack the alien in return in an attempt to escape, Chakotay, having observed how smaller members of the species behave in deference to the larger, recommends Voyager mimics them to appear less threatening. Chakotay's plan is successful. (VOY: "Elogium")

Chakotay had a frustrating period in command when Voyager was being distorted by an unknown force that didn't respond to any of their attempts to reverse it. Janeway had been incapacitated by the force, leaving Chakotay in command. During these events, Chakotay vehemently opposed a challenge to his command from Tuvok but, when they thought they were possibly going to die, Chakotay tells Tuvok that, while he does find him to be arrogant at times, he can't deny that he's an excellent officer. Tuvok, in return, admits that he has had difficulty accepting Janeway's decision to promote Chakotay to first officer over him and apologizes for anything he did to make him uncomfortable. The force warping Voyager turned out to be a lifeform trying to communicate with them and the ship returned to normal once it had moved on. (VOY: "Twisted")

Chakotay meeting with a Sky Spirit
While stranded on a planet during an away mission, Chakotay came in contact with an alien race that spoke the language of his ancestors. The aliens explained that they had visited his ancestors over 45,000 years ago, gave them a genetic bonding and were known to the tribe as the Sky Spirits. When they eventually returned to Earth on their last trip, finding no trace of the tribe, they believed they had been wiped out by other Humans. 

When Chakotay met and spoke with the Sky Spirits, he was finally able to feel the kind of connection to his heritage that was always missing when he was younger. He wished that he could see his father's face now in this moment of epiphany. He explained to the aliens that Kolopak had died fighting for his colony, honoring the land just as he always said he would and just as his ancestors had done. During this encounter, Chakotay finally came to truly understand his father, telling him in spirit that he could finally hear the sky spirits. (VOY: "Tattoo") 

Chakotay and Janeway's relationship was tested when Chakotay left Voyager without permission to pursue Seska and the Kazon on his own in a shuttlecraft. With Seska's help, the Kazon had successfully raided Voyager and stolen transporter technology - technology that was unique to their part of the quadrant and with which they could dramatically change the balance of power in their favor. Janeway had decided Voyager would retrieve the techonology; however, while all the crew had been beaten by Seska, Chakotay took it personally, Seska having deceived him a number of times in the past, which ended up humiliated him because he had defended her. Chakotay's daring mission to destroy the stolen technology - using Maquis tactics he had learned from Seska - was successful, but left him stranded with the Kazon and put Voyager in danger when they rescued him (he had asked that they abandon him, a suggestion that was seriously considered by Janeway; she decided against it following an intervention from Torres, who said it would badly effect the crew if they left him). Chakotay was put on report, Janeway asking him, "How do you expect me to keep order when the first officer decides to run off like some cowboy because he believes it's a good idea?". Chakotay also received shocking news from Seska following his encounter with her: she said Chakotay was going to be a father because she had extracted some of his DNA and impregnated herself with it. (It turns out Chakotay wasn't the child's father, something he only learned months later - which, when discovered, was a surprise to Seska.) (VOY: "Maneuvers", "Basics, Part II")

Janeway and Chakotay working on building a boat on New Earth
The same year, Chakotay and Janeway were infected with an incurable virus which necessitated them being left behind on a planet whose environment somehow halted the progression of the disease. They named the planet New Earth and, while Janeway was not willing to give up on a cure, Chakotay came to terms with their predicament and worked on making the planet a better home. He even built Janeway a bath tub. During their time together, they drew closer and Janeway asked him to drop the formalities and call her Kathryn. The first signs of affection between the two also began to manifest as outside of a command structure a romantic relationship seemed less inappropriate, but both were still hesitant to act on their feelings. After an antidote was found for the disease and they returned to the ship, they decided to leave everything that had happened on the planet between them behind and maintain a professional relationship which eventually developed into a deep friendship between the two. The one thing that remained of this time was his continued use of her first name, an intimacy never granted to anyone else on board Voyager. (VOY: "Resolutions")

The third year (2373)
After Voyager traveled back in time to 20th century Los Angeles on Earth to stop Henry Starling from stealing the timeship Aeon, Chakotay had a conversation with Torres about what they would be doing with their lives if they were stuck in the 20th century. Chakotay said that he could see himself pursuing archaeology full-time, teaching at the university or working in Central America, making important discoveries and maybe even winning the Nobel Prize. The crew were successful in stopping Starling from taking the timeship into the future on a poorly-calculated journey that could have triggered a temporal explosion. They were then returned to the future they had come from, in their previous location in the Delta Quadrant, by a Federation officer piloting the Aeon from a now saved - and oblivious to the narrowly-missed disaster - 29th century. (VOY: "Future's End", "Future's End, Part II")

Later that year, he was injured during an away mission and trapped on a world where the inhabitants were engrossed in conflict. While recovering from his injuries, among one of the people who rescued him was a Human named Riley Frazier who, as it soon turned out, was a former Borg drone severed from the Collective, as had all the inhabitants on the planet. She explained that five years ago, their Borg cube was damaged by an electrokinetic storm and their link to the Collective severed. They moved to the planet but unfortunately, as soon as people began to assert their identities, conflicts erupted and people turned against each other. Some, like Riley and her companions, were not interested in fighting but wanted to work cooperatively. They asked Chakotay to help them by activating the neuro-electric field generator in the Borg cube so that they could reconnect the entire population. Riley explained that the link would provide them with the unique ability to cooperate and problem-solve so they would be rid of conflict and instead could finally create a safe and productive community. Chakotay passionately advocated for Riley but Janeway found it unconscionable to reactivate the cube. Pretending to have respected Janeway's decision, Riley and her friends – who had previously linked with Chakotay to heal his severe injuries – used the residual effects of the link to telepathically connect with him again and force him to reactivate their link. After Chakotay reactivated the cube, he was let go and the cube – as promised – was destroyed by the New Cooperative. Chakotay was somewhat disappointed with what they had done, stating that even though they held their part of the bargain, they did not hesitate to impose their collective will on him when it served their purposes. He wondered how long their ideals would last in the face of that kind of power. (VOY: "Unity")

The same year, Chakotay became involved in the Distant Origin Theory controversy among the Voth, a Saurian species that believed they were native to the Delta Quadrant. Forra Gegen, a leading Voth scientist and (like Chakotay) paleontologist, believed that the Voth were descended from a species in a different part of the galaxy: Earth. The official interpretation on the planet was that the Voth were the first beings to evolve into intelligent beings in the galaxy. After finding the bones of a Voyager crewmember, he believed that he had evidence of his theory. He discovered Voyager, and, using a cloaked device, boarded the ship, abducting Chakotay. The Doctor determined that the Voth had evolved from the dinosaurs on Earth. When the evidence was presented to the Voth council, Chakotay stood with Gegen to support his evidence and spoke persuasively. The council rejected the evidence and threatened to imprison Chakotay and the rest of the Voyager crew, unless Gegen publicly disavowed his theory, something Gegen felt he had no choice but to do. Before leaving, however, Chakotay gave Gegen a small hand-held globe of planet Earth in the hope that one day the Voth would see it as their place of origin. As they parted, Chakotay spoke Gegen's moto to him, "Eyes open", which Gegen returned. (VOY: "Distant Origin") 

Chakotay's holodeck image became a central figure in a Tuvok-written holoprogram about a Maquis-led mutiny. In that holonovel – which was originally written for training purposes in case of a mutiny – Chakotay was depicted as a traitor instigating a mutiny against Captain Janeway and the rest of the Starfleet crew in order to get them back home unhindered by Federation rules and principles. While amusing at first, the holonovel quickly turned dangerous when it was discovered that the program had been accessed by Seska before she left the ship and programmed to trap and kill whoever submitted changes to it. (VOY: "Worst Case Scenario")

That year also proved to be one of the most challenging chapters for Voyager and its crew as they finally entered the much dreaded Borg space. When they discovered that the Borg were at war with a powerful species known as Species 8472, Janeway decided to enter into an alliance with the Borg for safe passage through their space in exchange for helping them beat Species 8472. Chakotay was strongly against entering into such an unholy alliance, in part because of his experiences of being controlled by a collective using Borg techonolgy, but Janeway was convinced that it was the only option available to them. When the Borg betrayed Janeway, just as Chakotay had predicted, and she was injured, Chakotay took command and broke off the alliance. When Janeway recovered, she was disappointed that Chakotay did not trust her. This incident marked one of the many clashes between Chakotay and Janeway over command decisions. Chakotay was instrumental in defeating the Borg after they try to double-cross Voyager, linking with the drone Seven of Nine via a neural transceiver attached to his neck, communicating with the Human part of the drone before Torres send a power surge to overwhelm the drone. Chakotay was injured in the process. He was extremely sceptical of Janeway's decision to try to integrate Seven of Nine into the Voyager crew. (VOY: "Scorpion", " Scorpion, Part II")

The fourth year (2374)
In 2374, Chakotay had various encounters with a number of different races. After a shuttle accident, he was brainwashed by the Vori, who had him join their war against the Kradin. They used simulated scenarios of innocent Vori being killed and tortured. Despite the peace he had found and peaceful ways he had learned over the recent years while on Voyager, he became so embittered by the Vori proaganda that he turned into a killing machine. He was rescued by Tuvok and convinced of the brainwashing before he could complete his first real incursion against the Kradin. (VOY: "Nemesis")

Chakotay loses his hair and starts rapidly aging
He and the crew were used in medical experiments by the Srivani. When Neelix was almost killed in an accident and brought back to life, Neelix questioned his beliefs in the afterlife and the meaning of life itself. Chakotay, being a spiritual man himself, urged Neelix to not draw any negative conclusions from his experience but instead see them as a time for growth into a potentially stronger faith. (VOY: "Scientific Method", "Mortal Coil")

Chakotay saved Voyager from the Dream Aliens: they had caused the crew to remain in a dream state while they were attempting to destroy the ship. Chakotay used lucid dreaming in order to remain in control during his dream and thus interacted with the aliens. He managed to wake himself and, with The Doctor's help, stay awake while he worked out how to help the crew. He eventually found that the aliens were using a large transmitter on their home world to boost their dream control to the entire crew. He told The Doctor to aim a torpedo at the cavern and, upon reentering the dream controlled by the aliens, tells the alien leader to end the dream or face destruction, freeing the crew from alien control. (VOY: "Waking Moments")

Chakotay and his fellow Maquis received bad news this year when Starfleet managed to get messages to Voyager. In a letter from Sveta, the person who had recruited him into the Maquis, Chakotay heard that the Maquis have been defeated and many of his Maquis friends had been killed. Chakotay relayed this to the other Maquis on board. (VOY: "Hunters")

The Hirogen hijacked Voyager during this year and turned the holodecks into a hunting arena, forcing the crew to battle against them in different holo simulations. The crew, with neural interfaces implanted in their necks, believed themselves to be the characters they were playing in these deadly games. In one such simulation, in which the Hirogen took on the role of Nazis during World War II, Chakotay was Captain Miller of the United States Army. Thankfully, efforts to liberate the crew, initiated by The Doctor and Harry Kim, were successful. (VOY: "The Killing Game", "The Killing Game, Part II")

Chakotay and an alien from an isolationist species fell in love during the course of this year. The problem was, however, that due to their biology Kellin's race, the Ramuran, were forgotten within hours of absence from members of other species. Chakotay didn't remember Kellin upon her return to Voyager, where she sought aslyum from her people, who would try to capture her and return her to Ramura. She had returned to Voyager because she loved Chakotay, specifically because he was kind. Initially unsure of Kellin, having forgotten her after her previous departure, they quickly fell in love again. Unfortunately, a Ramuran tracer boarded Voyager and wiped Kellin's memory of life outside of Ramura, including Chakotay. Chakotay tried to convince her they were in love but failed and sadly said goodbye. Before he forgot, he wrote down his memories of his time with Kellin. (VOY: "Unforgettable")

Chakotay demonstrated his extensive piloting ability when he landed Voyager on a Demon class planetoid, successfully navigating the starship through its savage atmosphere. Later, on an away mission to look for missing crewmates Paris and Kim, when tricorders weren't able to help he used scouting skills he had learned from his tribe. While on the planet, Chakotay and the crew allowed themselves to be duplicated by a biomimetic lifeform known as Silver Blood. (VOY: "Demon")

The fifth year (2375)
Chakotay effectively captained Voyager for months as it journeyed through an area of space seemingly devoid of life and even planetary objects and stars. During this time, Janeway had confined herself to quarters and was suffering from depression brought on because she felt guilty for stranding her crew far from home. Chakotay tries to convince her to resume her duties fully but she refuses. Later, as Janeway tried to assuage her guilt by ordering the crew to abandon her at one end of a spatial vortex she will destroy once they have pass safely through, Chakotay leads the crew in refusing her orders, forcing Janeway to reconsider and stay with the crew. He informs the captain that he "wouldn't be a fine first officer if I hadn't". Moments prior to the crew's confrontation with the cpatain, Chakotay asked for Tuvok's support in refusing her, which may have been a turning point in their relationship. (VOY: "Night")

The news, received the previous year, about the defeat of the Maquis and the deaths of their Maquis friends effected the Maquis onboard Voyager in different ways. Months after hearing the news, B'Elanna Torres, who had initially reacted with anger, had become depressed and numb to all feelings in her life and began taking extreme risks in an effort to feel alive: turning the safety protocols off in the holo deck, she would fight Cardassians or go orbital skydiving. When it became apparent that she was unwell, Chakotay tried to help her. Using rather forceful methods - perhaps because he himself was disturbed by one of Torres' holo programs, which depicted the deaths of their Maquis friends - he made Torres confront her thoughts and actions, reminding her that, while she had lost much of her Maquis family, the crew on Voyager were her family, too, that they would be with her, and that she needed to find other ways to deal with her depression. (VOY: "Hunters", "Extreme Risk")

Chakotay and the infamous kiss with a member of Species 8472
Chakotay encountered Species 8472 again, when Voyager discovered an Earth-like recreation on a space station. It turned out to be a training facility for a possible invasion of Earth by Species 8472. They had assumed various identities of Starfleet officers. While on reconnaissance away missions to the station he became romantically involved with one of the aliens who had assumed the identity of a Starfleet commander named Valerie Archer. Their mutual respect and trust were important factors in persuading their superiors to come to a diplomatic agreement to avoid conflict. (VOY: "In the Flesh")

In 2375, Voyager was able to apparently perfect their own version of the Quantum slipstream drive to get them home. However, a potential glitch in the drive meant Chakotay and Harry Kim had to use the Delta Flyer to map the slipstream in advance of Voyager, monitoring potential instabilities in the slipstream matrix as it formed and relaying corrections back to the larger ship. The night before the voyage, Janeway invited Chakotay to dinner in her quarters, their last night in the Delta Quadrant. When asked, Chakotay expressed doubts about the plan to use the drive, stating that the risks were so high Starfleet engineers would not allow it. Janeway said she was willing to take the risk and asked if Chakotay was with her. "Always", he replied. Chakotay piloted the Flyer while Paris was at Voyager's helm. The drive destablised shortly into the voyage and did not return the ship to the Alpha Quadrantc, although it did knock ten years off the journey. (VOY: "Timeless")

It was this at point, more than a year since Seven of Nine had been severed from the Borg Collective and joined the crew of Voyager, who were now at risk of loosing her to an illness, that Chakotay expressed to Janeway that she had proved him wrong regarding her decision to integrate Seven into the crew. (VOY: "Infinite Regress")

Chakotay's hopes and fears were revealed when Voyager came into contact with a "Telepathic pitcher plant" during this year. The enormous space-dwelling organism inticed the ship into its digestive tract by making the crew believe it was a wormhole home where they would received their desires. Chakotay imagined he'd received a full pardon for his actions as Maquis and a professorship of Anthropology at Starfleet Academy. (VOY: "Bliss")

Chakotay devised the plan for stealing the Borg transwarp coil from a Borg sphere described by Janeway as "Fort Knox". The heist was successful, except that during the away mission Seven of Nine chose to return to the Collective. Despite his previous steps to acceptance of Seven of Nine, Chakotay was ready to wondered if she had betrayed Voyager. (VOY: "Dark Frontier")

When Voyager became trapped in chaotic space, alien inhabitants of that region communicated with Chakotay by reactivating a medically supressed, defective gene of his responsible for an inherited cognitive disorder called sensory tremens that could cause realistic auditory and visual hallucinations - which the aliens spoke through, appearing to Chakotay in the faces of his friends, family and a boxing opponent. Chakotay – whose grandfather, Chakotay believed, had become insane because of the gene – was frightened of becoming like his ancestor and resisted the aliens' efforts. Fighting against his fears, he learned from the aliens how to guide the ship out of chaotic space before the ship was destroyed by the anomaly. (VOY: "The Fight")

While bringing up the rear of an away team escaping a depreasurising deck on a Malon export vessel contaminated with theta radiation, Chakotay was knocked unconscious by flying debris and had to be beamed out of the vaccum to Voyager. (VOY: "Juggernaut")

One of the more serious conflicts between him and Captain Janeway occurred in late 2375 with the discovery of the USS Equinox that was commanded by Starfleet Captain Rudolph Ransom. Ransom and his crew had been using nucleogenic lifeforms as fuel for their special warp drive; an act that appalled Janeway unimaginably, especially because it was a dishonor to Starfleet, leading her to set upon a relentless hunt until the Equinox and its crew were brought to justice. In her fury, she not only compromised the safety of the ship on numerous occasions, despite Chakotay's advice, but also wanted to subject one of Ransom's captured crew members to torture to retrieve information out of him. Chakotay was successful at preventing the worst from happening and warned her that he would not tolerate her crossing that line again. Janeway, angered and determined, relieved Chakotay of duty, so she could pursue Ransom unhindered. When she finally came to her senses she realized how she had crossed the line herself and that Chakotay would certainly have had good reason to have stage a mutiny against her. Chakotay said he had thought of doing such, but that that would have been crossing the line. (VOY: "Equinox")

The sixth year (2376)
Towards the start of this year, Seven of Nine learned she was responsible for the condition of three members of her former Borg unimatrix whose minds were still linked despite having escaped the Collective. As they lie unconscious in sickbay, she battles with guilt and their fate: to seperate them into individuals who will die within a month, or return them to the Borg where they will live longer but as part of the Collective. Chakotay tried to comfort Seven, asks her to think about her experience and to consider the difference between existing and living. Seven's decision is that "Existence is insufficient". (VOY: "Survival Instinct")

Voyager was caught in a conflict begun by the Vaadwaur, a confrontational and treacherous species that was revived after over eight-hundred years in stasis. They had been revived by a crew member with good intentions and, as they were unknown to Voyager and seemed in need, Janeway made an alliance with them. Chakotay felt uncertain about the Vaadwaur's intentions and was wary of awakening them, recalling an old Greek myth about a dragon killed in battle whose teeth fell to the ground only to spring up as full-grown warriors to continue the fight. He used this allegory to demonstrate how Voyager might inadvertently be re-instigating a bloody war that had long stopped. (VOY: "Dragon's Teeth")
