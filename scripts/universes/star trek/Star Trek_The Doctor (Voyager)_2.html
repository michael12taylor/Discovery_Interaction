<html><p>Chosen by The Doctor in 2404 of an alternate timeline, in which Voyager returned home 16 years later than it ultimately did. Apparently a permanent selection.

In addition, over the years several Voyager crewmembers such as Paris, Harry Kim, Chakotay, and B'Elanna Torres took to simply calling him "Doc." (VOY: "Caretaker", et al.) Kim introduced The Doctor to a holographic representation of Crell Moset, explaining that "his friends call him Doc." (VOY: "Nothing Human")

He was identified to Jupiter Station's computer by Doctor Zimmerman, during The Doctor's visit in 2377, as "Voyager's EMH". (VOY: "Life Line") He was also identified by Tuvok with the same designation, during the arbitration of the release of The Doctor's holonovel, Photons Be Free, when he stated to Ardon Broht that "you claim The Doctor doesn't have the legal right to control his holoprogram, yet you're promoting the fact that Voyager's EMH wrote it." (VOY: "Author, Author")

Other times he was identified as "Voyager's doctor", once by Pete Harkins, and another time by Quarren, upon encountering The Doctor's backup. (VOY: "Pathfinder", "Living Witness")

Holo-family
The Doctor's family
The Doctor decided to create a holographic family, Doctor's Family Program Beta-Rho, in Voyager's holodeck in 2373, using the name Kenneth for himself. They consisted of a wife, Charlene, and two children, a son, Jeffrey, and a daughter, Belle.

At first, family life was blissfully perfect until B'Elanna Torres "visited" the family at home and found them to be unrealistic. She altered the program, adding randomness and "realism". As a result, his teenage son Jeffrey became rebellious and began to hang out with some unsavory Klingon youths. In addition, he argued with Charlene and lost the formerly close bond he had possessed with Belle. Upon Belle's Parrises squares accident, the family came together. 

Comforting Belle
Initially apprehensive about losing her, The Doctor was persuaded by Tom Paris not to delete the program after this incident, but to work through her death with his remaining family. (VOY: "Real Life")

Hobbies
Opera
The Doctor, singing
The Doctor took a keen interest in opera, frequently practicing his singing with a holographic soprano. (VOY: "The Swarm")

Seven of Nine helped with The Doctor's singing capabilities when, while being held against her will on the USS Equinox, she noticed his vocal modulations deviated by 0.30 decihertz. When they returned to Voyager, she informed him of this fact and he agreed to meet her on the holodeck: "Just you, me and a tuning fork." (VOY: "Equinox, Part II")

Writing
Singing was not the only creative outlet for The Doctor. He worked hard to create a holographic novel called Photons Be Free, based on an EMH on the starship Vortex and the treatment he faced from the organic members of the crew. The characters and the environment were strongly based on the crew of Voyager. After discovering his friends were concerned about his interpretation of them, he agreed to change it despite the weeks of work involved.

His publisher didn't appreciate the delay and so published the original version. In an argument with the publisher, The Doctor was told he had no rights: although he might be the author, as a hologram he wasn't a sentient being. During the subsequent debate, Janeway, Tuvok, Seven, Barclay and Kim spoke on The Doctor's behalf. Tuvok pointed out that The Doctor had created an original piece of work; Seven explained how The Doctor helped her develop as a person; Barclay compared The Doctor's aid to Zimmerman as a son seeking his father's approval; Kim explained how the Emergency Command Hologram subroutines represented a human desire to change; and Janeway cited The Doctor's defiance of her orders as a human action, something that a mere hologram – designed to obey orders – couldn't have done. At the conclusion of the 'trial', The Doctor, though not deemed a "person" at the time, was found to have the same rights as a non-holographic author and was allowed to recall the original version of the holonovel in favor of the new one when it was ready. The judge further urged The Doctor to continue his fight for sentience upon his return to Federation space. (VOY: "Author, Author")

Photography
The Doctor also was something of a shutterbug. He enjoyed using a holo-imager to record his experiences, times with his friends and away missions. In one instance this fascination caused him to reveal a conspiracy against him designed to suppress his memory of events that led to a loop in his programming. (VOY: "Drone", "Latent Image", "Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy", "Life Line", "Course: Oblivion")

Inventions
The Doctor was responsible for fashioning a fully functional prosthetic eye for Seven of Nine's left eye socket capable of rendering images nearly as clearly as her right eye. (VOY: "The Gift")

The mobile emitter
The Doctor's mobile emitter
In 2373, Voyager encountered the Aeon under command of Captain Braxton. Due to a temporal paradox, Voyager was transported to Earth in 1996. During this mission The Doctor obtained a piece of 29th century technology from Henry Starling, originating from the Aeon, called a mobile emitter. This device, though only a few centimeters long, was able to contain the entire EMH program and project The Doctor autonomously. After the timeline was restored and Voyager returned to the Delta Quadrant, The Doctor kept the emitter. It was quickly established that the transfer of The Doctor's program to and from the emitter would be quite easy; practically all he had to do was issue a voice command and attach the emitter to his left shoulder.

This device proved to be of vital importance and saved the crew of Voyager on numerous occasions. One of the most notable times when the emitter proved useful was shortly after The Doctor had acquired it. He helped Captain Janeway fight off a swarm of macroviruses that had infected the ship; since Janeway had been away at the time, and The Doctor (as a hologram) was naturally immune to the virus, they were forced to stand alone to save the crew. (VOY: "Macrocosm") The emitter also allowed The Doctor to help crew members all over the ship, which was especially useful after Kes left a short time later. (VOY: "The Gift")

The mobile emitter helped The Doctor to watch over the ship while the crew was in stasis during a trip through a radioactive Mutara class nebula. While proving to be helpful in allowing The Doctor to help Seven of Nine during this situation, the nebula affected the emitter, damaging its electro-optic transmitter. The Doctor, later, linked the emitter to the EPS relay network. For some time, this worked, until the EPS relays started to fail, after which the emitter went offline. (VOY: "One")

Due to a transporter accident, the mobile emitter was combined with some of Seven of Nine's nanoprobes. This, combined with Ensign Mulchaey's DNA, created a new Borg drone with 29th century technology and the mobile emitter intact as an integral part of its central nervous system. This drone called himself One and eventually sacrificed himself in order to save the crew of Voyager. Afterward, the mobile emitter was salvaged and returned to The Doctor. (VOY: "Drone")

On some occasions the emitter was stolen from The Doctor and/or used by rogue programs, such as Dejaren, Iden, and the reprogrammed EMH Mark I of the USS Equinox. (VOY: "Flesh and Blood", "Equinox, Part II") On all occasions however, The Doctor was able to recover the emitter with no apparent side effects to his program. The mobile emitter was also used by a version of The Doctor that had corrupted files after he had attempted to improve his personality. (VOY: "Darkling")

Other notable occasions in which the emitter was used by holograms other than The Doctor were when the Leonardo da Vinci hologram was transferred to it after both the emitter and main computer core were stolen in a transporter attack (VOY: "Concerning Flight") and when The Doctor loaned the emitter to the Barclay hologram that had been received in a data stream. (VOY: "Inside Man") Michael Sullivan also used it to be transferred out of the holodeck and onto Voyager's bridge, believing the emitter to be a charm to get into the spirit world. (VOY: "Spirit Folk")

Personal relationships
While starting out as nothing more than a piece of equipment intended to provide a short-term supplement for the existing medical team, The Doctor went on to form far greater bonds with the rest of the Voyager crew as time went on. Thanks to Kes's initial efforts to encourage him to assert himself as a person rather than a machine, the Doctor gained control over his own activation code and was accorded all the respect and authority of a biological chief medical officer, save for the obvious detail that he remained in sickbay rather than being granted his own quarters even after the acquisition of the mobile emitter gave him the opportunity to exist outside of sickbay. The respect he received among the rest of the crew for his role as medical officer was so great that the entire crew twice sacrificed opportunities to communicate with their families so that The Doctor could deal with personal business, once when he requested that he be transmitted back to the Alpha Quadrant to try and treat the dying Lewis Zimmerman (essentially the closest person he had to a father) despite this preventing any other messages being sent back for another month, and a second time when the senior staff used their daily eleven minutes of contact with Earth to hold a court case that would determine whether The Doctor was entitled to legal rights despite his holographic status. 

Friends
Kes
Kes in 2373
Kes was one of The Doctor's first friends on board Voyager and over the course of her stay aboard the ship, the two bonded considerably. Their friendship began early in the first year after Kes displayed great interest in medicine. This interest led The Doctor to commence training her, which brought them close as colleagues. (VOY: "Phage") Kes was able to quickly study the works given by The Doctor, which greatly intrigued him. Although The Doctor exhibited a terrible bedside manner and had a personality that wasn't pleasing to the rest of the crew, he reacted more kindly to Kes, treating her as a colleague and friend. (VOY: "Eye of the Needle") Kes in turn was always very encouraging of The Doctor, insisting that he was more than a projection and that there was no reason why he could not exceed his original programming. Kes' care for The Doctor evidently had a powerful effect on him; when his program suffered damage in 2372 and he began to hallucinate that he was his creator, Dr. Lewis Zimmerman, his hallucination included a human Kes as his wife. In that simulation, The Doctor confessed to Kes that he always found her to be beautiful during a time when "Lewis" appeared to be "dying". After The Doctor's program was recovered, he told Kes about his hallucination. Kes promised to keep what he had told her between them in case Neelix found out in another bout of jealousy. (VOY: "Projections")

The Doctor comforts Kes in Chez Sandrine
However, romance between the two never developed, and The Doctor and Kes settled into a father/daughter relationship, with The Doctor becoming Kes' teacher and mentor during her time as a medical student and assistant. Kes' trust in The Doctor was so great that she asked him to perform the rolissisin – a ritual usually performed by the daughter's father shortly before conception – on her. (VOY: "Elogium")

Kes persuaded Janeway that The Doctor should be given more respect and consideration by granting him some authority over his deactivation code, a significant step towards being regarded as a full member of the crew rather than a piece of equipment. Kes always encouraged The Doctor to embrace and develop his personality, and she helped him become part of the crew. At a time when The Doctor was believed to be nothing but a program based on another program without the capacity of independent decision making, she told him that there was no difference between how he accessed his programs and made decisions for medical treatments and how she, a flesh and blood being, made decisions based on information stored inside her brain. Kes also encouraged him to pick a name and advised him when he had desperately fallen for Danara Pel but did not know how to handle those emotions. All these encouragements helped The Doctor to realize his potential. (VOY: "Lifesigns", "The Swarm")

The next year Kes helped save The Doctor's matrix when, due to his program having been active far longer than it was designed for, he began to lose his memories and skills as a physician. After Torres activated a hologram of Dr. Lewis Zimmerman, he explained that The Doctor had been online too long and was deteriorating. Kes persuaded Zimmerman to graft his matrix onto The Doctor's, restoring his mental capabilities. (VOY: "The Swarm") 

Later that year, when The Doctor's program developed a secondary, evil personality as a result of his experimenting with his personality subroutines, the "Dark Doctor", despite his deep resentments, still appeared deep down to care for Kes, albeit in a more twisted fashion than the normal Doctor. Not only did he try to kill Zahir, the alien whom Kes had developed feelings for, but he also claimed, during his capture of her, that she needed his help and protection because she was naive. (VOY: "Darkling") 

In an alternate timeline, The Doctor told Kes that she was the finest friend he ever had. (VOY: "Before and After")

Seven of Nine
Seven gives The Doctor a friendly kiss
The Doctor was responsible for the removal of Seven's implants and also conducted her weekly maintenance sessions. He also took it upon himself to teach Seven social behavior, using the same interpersonal relationship exercises Kes once practiced with him. (VOY: "Prey") Later, he created a holodeck simulation of Voyager for her to become more comfortable with large social gatherings. (VOY: "One")

The Doctor encouraged Seven to explore romantic relationships in 2375. He coached her in the basics of dating and grooming, using a lesson plan entitled "Love Amid the Stars". He also discovered her singing voice and the two sang a duet of "You Are My Sunshine". He was partially motivated by a wager made with Ensign Paris, who believed that Seven would not be able to bring a date to a reception planned aboard Voyager without making a scene. Although Seven's date with Lieutenant Chapman ended in disaster, she attended the reception with The Doctor and charmed the guests with a toast to individuality. However, she was hurt to discover that The Doctor's help was due to the bet. At this point, The Doctor found himself falling in love with Seven but refused to admit it to her. He tried to apologize to her but she came to him first and said she no longer needed the lessons in romance, because there were no suitable mates aboard. The Doctor was very disappointed that Seven did not reciprocate his feelings. (VOY: "Someone to Watch Over Me")

In 2376, while The Doctor was stranded aboard the USS Equinox along with Seven, the crew disengaged his ethical subroutines to extract activation codes for their warp drive from Seven's cranial implants, which would leave her mentally disabled. The Doctor almost went through with the procedure, but Captain Rudolph Ransom stopped him. He apologized to Seven for the incident and she held no ill will towards him. (VOY: "Equinox, Part II")

The Doctor created a subroutine for daydreaming in early 2376. Seven featured prominently in several fantasies, either serving as a damsel in distress or competing with other female Voyager crew members for The Doctor's affections. He even fantasized about painting her in the nude. When the fantasies began to overrun his program, his mental activity was tied into the holodeck, allowing Seven to see what he had been daydreaming. She did not take offense but after she kissed him following Captain Janeway's announcement that the Emergency Command Hologram subroutines would be developed, she made it clear that it was simply a platonic gesture. (VOY: "Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy") 

The Doctor as Seven of Nine
While Ensign Kim, Seven, and The Doctor conducted a routine survey on board the second Delta Flyer in 2377, they were captured by a race known as the Lokirrim. The Lokirrim had waged war against holographic lifeforms who rebelled against Lokirrim rule, and as a result they banned all holographic activity within their borders. Seven transferred The Doctor's program to her cortical implant in order to hide him from the Lokirrim and prevent him from being decompiled. In the process The Doctor took control of Seven's motor abilities and was essentially trapped in her body. The Doctor tried to engineer an escape by cultivating a relationship with a Lokirrim official, Ranek, but the new sensations of taste and emotion were too tempting for The Doctor. He ended up overindulging in several foods and causing pain to Seven. Ranek later called Seven to the ship's bridge with the intention of setting up a romantic liaison. Although The Doctor was able to see his command codes, Ranek attempted to kiss him in Seven's body. Shortly afterward, he went to complain about the incident to Jaryn, a crewwoman with whom The Doctor had been working to treat injured Lokirrim crew. The Doctor became sexually aroused when Jaryn gave Seven a neck massage. Both incidents greatly irritated Seven, and once he had been returned to the mobile emitter, they got into an argument about the value of indulgence. The Doctor felt Seven showed excessive restraint and did not allow for superfluous pleasure, which he believed was an important part of life. Kim managed to return the subject to escape, and The Doctor and Seven worked together once again to transmit a distress signal to Voyager. The Doctor was downloaded back into Seven's implants and was able to convince Ranek to join her on a second date. They knocked him out at the first available opportunity and transmitted a message to Voyager including the ship's command codes. Their plan was discovered by Jaryn and Seven was taken captive. After Voyager arrived, Seven returned The Doctor's program to the mobile emitter and they escaped. Upon their return to the ship, Seven decided that The Doctor had a point about her restraint concerning pleasures such as food. She brought a meal to sickbay and described the sensations of eating it to him, allowing him to experience it vicariously. (VOY: "Body and Soul")

When The Doctor's rights as an individual came into question, Seven testified at the hearing conducted with Starfleet Command. She spoke highly of The Doctor, appreciative of his efforts to help her develop individuality. (VOY: "Author, Author")

In 2378 when The Doctor believed he was about to die, he finally admitted his feelings for her and was embarrassed when he survived. (VOY: "Renaissance Man") The Doctor was also crestfallen when he learned Seven had begun to date Chakotay. (VOY: "Endgame")

Tom Paris
Tom Paris and The Doctor
Although their relationship was often a difficult one, The Doctor also managed to become close friends with Paris, who affectionately referred to The Doctor as "Doc" on several occasions. One of the key points in their friendship was the fact that it was Paris who helped The Doctor explore one of the most difficult aspects of being a member of the crew: relationships. When The Doctor was initially rejected by Danara Pel, he went to Paris for relationship advice and Paris helped set The Doctor and Denara up on a date in a holoprogram, informing The Doctor that his current approach to women was all wrong. (VOY: "Lifesigns") When The Doctor created a holographic family and one of his 'children' faced death after an accident, it was Paris who convinced The Doctor to keep running the program rather than shut it down, realizing that The Doctor needed to experience the negative aspects of family life if he wanted to develop as a person. (VOY: "Real Life")

Paris turns the tables on The Doctor in his version of Photons Be Free
After Kes' departure from the ship, Paris was chosen as The Doctor's new medical assistant, serving as Voyager's CMO when The Doctor was unavailable. Over time it became clear that, although he complained about the role, he still wanted The Doctor's respect as a person. This was the main reason Paris resented The Doctor's holonovel about abused holograms, Photons Be Free; he worried that 'his' character, a womanizer called Lieutenant Marseilles who cheated on his wife, reflected how The Doctor saw him. Despite this, when the crew arranged a trial to determine The Doctor's legal rights after his publisher released the novel ahead of schedule, Paris objected to Tuvok's suggestion that they claim that The Doctor had no right to sell the holonovel in the first place, as they would basically have been admitting that The Doctor was not a real person. (VOY: "Author, Author")

Kathryn Janeway
Captain Janeway
As the crew's journey unfolded, Janeway soon found herself becoming friends with The Doctor, despite initially regarding him as just another hologram. The Doctor also initially disliked Janeway, making several notes on what he regarded as her more "questionable" command decisions before he fully came to regard himself as part of the crew. As the journey unfolded however, the two of them became closer, particularly when Janeway and The Doctor were the only two crew members standing between Voyager and the macrovirus that was attacking the ship. (VOY: "Macrocosm")

As the journey went on, the two of them also began to develop an almost mother/son relationship, with The Doctor often coming to Janeway when he needed personal advice or information about how his program was developing, as well as consolation about any wrong decisions he had made in recent times. Janeway stopped The Doctor from deleting the additional subroutines that made him unique when he felt responsible for a death. (VOY: "Retrospect") Janeway assured The Doctor that none of the crew thought any less of him when he was embarrassed about the fantasies created by his daydream program, (VOY: "Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy") and Janeway told The Doctor that none of the crew blamed him for betraying them to try and help a crew of holograms. (VOY: "Flesh and Blood") As well as that, when Janeway faced death after being captured by an alien species, The Doctor risked everything to save her. (VOY: "Renaissance Man") When The Doctor's legal rights were questioned after his holo-novel was released ahead of schedule before he had the chance to make edits, Janeway spoke in his defense at the subsequent hearing, citing his defiance of her orders as proof that he had grown beyond his original programming where he would do nothing but follow orders, affirming that she considered him a friend as well as a member of her crew. (VOY: "Author, Author")

B'Elanna Torres
Although their two-way doctor/patient relationship (The Doctor treating Torres' injuries while Torres "treated" any damage sustained by his program) could be difficult at times, The Doctor and B'Elanna Torres went on to develop a surprising friendship and working relationship, such as when the two brainstormed possible solutions to help reactivate Automated Unit 3947 when he was recovered and his power was running out. Torres also helped The Doctor gain a better understanding of his new mobile emitter after he acquired it, clearly expressing her fascination with the new technology. A particularly dark period for the two was when The Doctor attempted to remove a cytoplasmic lifeform from Torres using knowledge acquired from the hologram of Crell Moset, a Cardassian doctor who had committed various war crimes. Although Torres' feelings were hurt when The Doctor dismissed her musical opinions while preparing to give a concert for the Qomar, she later convinced him not to reprogram himself to reach the high notes achievable by the Qomar's new hologram because he would be sacrificing his identity for others if he tried to reprogram himself in that manner. Their relationship became so close that, when Torres learned that she was pregnant, she asked The Doctor to be the child's godfather, and even when faced with the possibility that she could give birth to the child on Earth in Starfleet Medical, she made it clear that she wanted The Doctor to be the supervising physician rather than some stranger. (VOY: "Prototype", "Future's End, Part II", "Nothing Human", "Virtuoso", "Lineage", "Endgame")

Romance
Danara Pel
In 2372, The Doctor encountered the Vidiian Doctor Danara Pel and developed romantic feelings for her. She gave him the name Shmullus, after her uncle who always made her smile. When they met again later that year, Denara again called The Doctor "Shmullus," although he never used the name despite his fondness for it. (VOY: "Lifesigns", "Resolutions")

Mareeza
Later that year, Voyager became trapped in orbit around a planet where time advanced at a much faster rate than normal. The Doctor determined that the transition into this accelerated timeframe could be fatal to a humanoid and so volunteered to transport to the surface himself. It was intended that he would only spend three seconds on the planet which equated to around two days on the surface but attempts to transport him back to Voyager failed. Chakotay guessed that The Doctor would spend his time in the city's cultural center and he was located a short time after being transported down. However, to The Doctor, he had spent three years on the surface. He met a woman named Mareeza, whom he later described as his "roommate", and had a son named Jason Tabreez. (VOY: "Blink of an Eye")

Alternate Doctors
Holographic recreations
The Doctor was holographically duplicated on a number of occasions. 

The entire crew of Voyager was recreated by Tuvok from his Insurrection Alpha program, including The Doctor. (VOY: "Worst Case Scenario")
Harry Kim attempted to recreate the Doctor when he was transmitted to the USS Prometheus in 2374, but the new program was unable to function properly and it collapsed. (VOY: "Message in a Bottle")
Reginald Barclay recreated The Doctor in 2376. (VOY: "Pathfinder")
Various miniature copies of The Doctor were created by the Qomar due to their admiration for The Doctor's singing. (VOY: "Virtuoso")
Harry Kim and Seven of Nine projected The Doctor's daydreams into the holodeck in order to better understand what was malfunctioning. In this daydream, The Doctor wore a painter's smock and beret while he painted a holographic representation of Seven in the nude. (VOY: "Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy")
After he stole The Doctor's program, Gar left a copy – created from one of The Doctor's old training files – aboard the starship to cover his tracks. (VOY: "Critical Care")
In 2378, Seven recreated the crew of Voyager to perfect her social skills, including The Doctor. (VOY: "Human Error")
The Doctor served as the narrator of his own holonovel, Photons Be Free, set aboard the USS Vortex, which was based on the crew of the USS Voyager, albeit the names were changed to protect the innocent. (VOY: "Author, Author")
A holodeck recreation of The Doctor by Tom Paris in his rendition of the holonovel Photons Be Free in 2378. (VOY: "Author, Author")
Alternate realities and timelines
Dr. van Gogh
Hair!
In the possible future that Kes experienced when she began to travel backwards in time, The Doctor was offline for months during the "Year of Hell" conflict. When his program was restored, The Doctor developed a full head of hair, chose the name "Doctor Van Gogh" (although he briefly thought about calling himself Mozart) and tried to develop a means of extending Kes' life via use of a bio-temporal chamber which triggered her jumps back through time. Subsequently – or previously, depending on perspective – The Doctor of the present cured her of her sudden jumps back in time and this timeline never came to pass. (VOY: "Before and After")


Voyager crashed
In an alternate timeline where Voyager crashed into an ice planet while attempting to reach Earth via the use of a quantum slipstream drive, The Doctor's program was recovered fifteen years later by Chakotay and Harry Kim, who had been in the Delta Flyer when the crash took place, the two managing to reactivate sickbay's holographic emitters long enough to transfer the Doctor into his mobile emitter. Though at first reluctant due to the Temporal Prime Directive, The Doctor agreed to help as he wanted his friends to survive as well. With The Doctor's help, they managed to devise a means of transmitting information back in time to Seven of Nine's cortical implant before Voyager was destroyed, hoping to save the crew by stabilizing the slipstream and allowing them to reach Earth. After the attempt failed, it was The Doctor who made a tearful, defeated Kim realize that Voyager's salvation lay outside the slipstream, and to use the link to end the flight rather than prolong it; if they couldn't get Voyager home, they could at least save the ship and her crew. With the Flyer's warp core about to breach and rapidly running out of power to send the data, The Doctor volunteered the use of his emitter as a power source. Kim wished The Doctor goodbye before removing the emitter. This timeline was erased when Kim, moments before the Flyer exploded, successfully transmitted the data to Seven of Nine that would shut down the slipstream drive, with a message from Harry to his past self the only trace left of that history. (VOY: "Timeless")

Shattered Voyager
When Voyager was fractured into multiple different time periods, sickbay reverted to stardate 49624, a year prior to the acquisition of the mobile emitter. Despite his relative "youth", The Doctor of this time period was able to devise a chroniton-infused serum that would stabilize the temporal instability experienced by Commander Chakotay after the initial accident, as well as allow him to travel between the fractured time periods of the ship. Once he learned what had happened from Chakotay, The Doctor provided him with more samples of the serum, allowing Chakotay to "recruit" Janeway from a time before Voyager was sent to the Delta Quadrant, with this Janeway being surprised when she met The Doctor and witnessed his level of development compared to the original EMH program. When Chakotay's plan was able to undo the original accident, the timeline was altered so that The Doctor never experienced these events. (VOY: "Shattered")

Original 25th century
In the aborted timeline where Voyager took twenty-three years to return to the Alpha Quadrant, two weeks prior to the ten-year anniversary of the ship's return, The Doctor married a Human woman named Lana and even took the name of her grandfather, Joe. He remained the personal physician of Admiral Janeway, who credited her fine health to his exceptional care over the years, and continued to visit Tuvok to monitor his neural degradation. (VOY: "Endgame")

Appendices
Background information
The Doctor was played by actor Robert Picardo. The part of The Doctor disguised as a Hierarchy overlooker, in the episode "Renaissance Man", was played by J.R. Quinonez (see also: Roles with multiple performers).

The Doctor was created with the intention of essentially being an "outsider" who could comment on humanity from that perspective, much like how Spock, Data and Odo had been established in TOS, TNG, and DS9 respectively. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 167-168)

An early reference to the character concept that eventually became The Doctor was included in a series of notes that Executive Producer and Star Trek: Voyager co-creator Jeri Taylor wrote on 30 July 1993. The reference was listed among other subjects which had been covered during one of many developmental discussions she had with fellow Executive Producers Michael Piller and Rick Berman about the series (which was yet to be named). Specifically, this list included a mention of "Holo-Moriarty", referencing the Moriarty hologram from the Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes "Elementary, Dear Data" and "Ship in a Bottle". (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 175 & 179)

In another compilation of notes Jeri Taylor wrote a week later (on 3 August 1993), she included an outline of the character in a section titled "The Crew". The outline stated, "Holo-Doctor–A human or alien male or female (possibly Vulcan?) The medical officer of the ship is killed during the mission; remaining is the holographic character of the doctor who, like Moriarty, has 'awareness' of himself as a holodeck fiction. He longs for the time when he can walk free of the Holodeck. (Some discussion about the fact that one of the crew must become a 'student' of this doctor. Maybe one of the misfits [i.e., a Maquis] had been kicked out of medical school.)" (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 175, 176 & 177)

At this point, the three executive producers liked the concept of the doctor character. They therefore considered how they could explain or justify, in a way that would be sufficiently credible to the viewers, the character's existence, if he was to be a holographic yet sentient being, so that it fit with what had previously been established. This was evident in another summary of Jeri Taylor's notes, this time dated 6 August 1993. Reporting more character development for The Doctor, the document stated, "The Holo-Doctor represents a new, state-of-the-art technology which has capitalized on the serendipitous incident which created Moriarty, and has programmed a holographic character which has self-awareness of his situation and limitations." As the notes continued, they clarified that the team of series co-creators had discussed the idea that The Doctor had been made "a bit bland" when his programmer had created him, leading one of the "misfits" (a conn officer, who ultimately developed into the character of Chief Engineer B'Elanna Torres) to decide to tweak his personality programming during the mission. The team had also considered that the hologram may have been created by Reginald Barclay, designed in his own image, and that, while taking a leave of absence in an upcoming TNG episode, he could put "the polishing touches" to the program. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 182 & 183)

In several early first-season Star Trek: Voyager scripts, call sheets, and shooting schedules and during the pre-production phase, the character of The Doctor was referred to by name as "Doc Zimmerman" after Herman Zimmerman, since the show's producers had not yet decided to leave him unnamed. (VOY Season 2 DVD trivia text version of "The 37's") His initial description in the script for VOY: "Caretaker" originated this routine, as The Doctor was therein initially referred to "as a holographic man in a Starfleet medical uniform [....] He has no name for now... but we will get to know him in time as Doc Zimmerman. His manner is colorless, dry." The character continued to be referred to as having the name "Zimmerman" in all the scripts which were written for the series' first season.

In the special features on the Voyager DVD collection, Robert Picardo mentions that he ad-libbed during his audition for the role of The Doctor, adding the line, "I'm a doctor, not a lightbulb" at the end of his script; he says that he "got a laugh" from the assembled studio executives, even though ad-libbing isn't something that's generally done on a Star Trek production.

It was only once the scripts started to be written for VOY Season 2 that this character became officially known as "The Doctor". He is one of two ongoing characters in science fiction who are referred to by this title, as opposed to a proper name; the other is the protagonist of the long-running British television series Doctor Who.

Many people, including Robert Picardo himself, were initially opposed to Brannon Braga's idea of the mobile emitter, believing The Doctor's limitations to be one of the appeals of the character. However, Picardo ultimately relished the opportunities for growth of his character due to The Doctor's newfound mobility, without noticing any negative impact to his appeal to the fans; Picardo subsequently apologized to Braga. (Star Trek: Voyager Companion (p. 452))

Many fans have wondered if Robert Picardo actually did all of his singing himself. To answer that question, Picardo said, "I did all of my singing except for the second half of 'Virtuoso'. The Don Carlo duet and Rondine al Nido are voiced by an opera singer, Augostino Castellnano (I hope I spelled that correctly). He's a terrific guy. I simply couldn't sing high enough or well enough to pull them off, but I did my own singing in 'The Swarm', 'Tinker, Tenor...', 'Renaissance Man', 'Someone to Watch Over Me' and all the others."

Robert Picardo also appeared as The Doctor in "Borg Invasion 4D" at Star Trek: The Experience and also portrayed other EMHs in Star Trek: First Contact, DS9: "Doctor Bashir, I Presume", and VOY: "Author, Author".

Apocrypha
Robert Picardo has written a book based on and as told by his character, named The Hologram's Handbook. Picardo goes into depth about how he felt about various experiences while aboard Voyager, such as feeling "betrayed" by Kes when she extended the length of his bout with the flu, as well as genuine and helpful advice for any holograms finding it hard to fit in with 'organics'.

In Star Trek: Voyager - String Theory: Evolution, The Doctor is sent into Ocampa's distant past by a Nacene, which transfers him into the body of a recently-deceased Ocampan soldier, allowing him to experience the sensations of an organic body for the first time, although the conditions are so harsh that he cannot fully enjoy the experience. He is eventually returned to his time after meeting with Kes to oversee the birth of an Ocampan/Nacene hybrid.

In the Voyager relaunch book series, The Doctor became a famous proponent of holographic rights and eventually joined a Federation "think tank" with Seven of Nine. Following the events of the Destiny trilogy, The Doctor became chief surgeon of the Project Full Circle fleet, returning to the Delta Quadrant on a specialized medical ship he assisted in designing. He is subsequently the first member of the original Voyager crew to greet the resurrected Admiral Kathryn Janeway when she is restored to life by Q and Kes in The Eternal Tide. Following the discovery that Seven had formed a relationship with the Full Circle fleet's new counselor, The Doctor was reprogrammed by Zimmerman to move on from his old feelings for her, Zimmerman arguing that he was just accelerating the process of recovery that The Doctor would have gone through on his own, (Protectors) but a later attempt to defeat an alien life form forces The Doctor to trap the entity in a part of his program and erase his memories of Seven, leaving him unable to even recall most of the time they have spent together. (Atonement)

In the "Borg Invasion 4D" attraction at Star Trek: The Experience, The Doctor is the lead physician on board Copernicus Station on the edge of the Alpha and Delta Quadrants. While testing a group of people (the audience members) whose DNA apparently resists Borg nanoprobes, the station comes under assault by the Borg themselves. After the group of hopefuls is captured and in the process of assimilation, The Doctor breaks through the hallucination that the Borg Queen is projecting and informs them that help is on the way. Minutes later, Admiral Kathryn Janeway and the USS Voyager rescue the group and bring them back to safety. The story is helped by interactive 3D projections and real live actors. In the video segments, Robert Picardo reprises his role as The Doctor, as do Kate Mulgrew and Alice Krige for Admiral Janeway and the Borg Queen, respectively.

The Doctor (voiced by Robert Picardo) is one of several Voyager cast members who reprise their roles in the Delta Rising expansion of Star Trek Online, along with Tim Russ (Tuvok), Ethan Phillips (Neelix), Garrett Wang (Harry Kim), Jeri Ryan (Seven of Nine), and later Robert Duncan McNeill (Tom Paris). Players meet The Doctor several times as they explore the Delta Quadrant thirty years after Voyager first explored the region.
