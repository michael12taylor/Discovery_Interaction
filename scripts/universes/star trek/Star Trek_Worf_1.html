Early life
Sunrise over Khitomer
Worf was born in 2340 on the Klingon homeworld, Qo'noS, as the son of Mogh, patriarch of one of the Klingon Empire's Great Houses. (TNG: "Sins of the Father")

When Worf was five years old, his father took him and his mother to live on the Khitomer colony, along with Worf's ghojmoK, Kahlest. (TNG: "Sins of the Father") There, Mogh took Worf on a ritual hunt along with a garrison warrior, L'Kor. Worf had not yet reached the Age of Inclusion and was barely able to hold a bat'leth. During the hunt, Worf was mauled by a beast, leaving behind a scar and memory he kept throughout his life. (TNG: "Birthright, Part I")

At some point when Worf was a child, he had a pet targ. (TNG: "Where No One Has Gone Before")

In 2346, the Klingon Empire and the Romulan Star Empire were officially allied but a conspiracy between the Romulans and the House of Duras left the Klingon Empire open to betrayal. Romulan forces attacked the Khitomer colony, killing nearly all of the four thousand Klingon colonists, including Worf's parents. (TNG: "Sins of the Father", "The Neutral Zone")

The Rozhenkos
Foster parents Sergey and Helena Rozhenko
The colony's distress call was answered by the Federation starship USS Intrepid. An Intrepid chief petty officer, Sergey Rozhenko, found Worf buried in the rubble, with Kahlest being the only other survivor found. After the Klingon Empire stated that the young boy apparently had no living relatives, Sergey took Worf to his homestead on the farming colony of Gault. He and his wife, Helena, raised the Klingon child alongside their own son, Nikolai. The two boys regarded each other as siblings. (TNG: "The Neutral Zone", "Heart of Glory", "Family", "Homeward"; DS9: "Change of Heart")

As the sole Klingon in a small farm culture, Worf had some difficulty adapting to his new circumstances, though; years later, Helena described her son as bright and highly spirited as a boy. Soon after his arrival on Gault, the seven year-old bloodied the noses of five teenage boys, whom Worf deemed "disrespectful". He refused to partake in Human food, preferring the Klingon cuisine he'd been raised on; Helena would learn how to make Rokeg blood pie for Worf, which he loved and greatly appreciated. In 2353, at thirteen years of age, Worf led his school's soccer team to the championships, where, in an attempt to score, he collided with another player, Mikel, when they both went to head the ball. The impact of Klingon ridges against a Human skull snapped Mikel's neck, and the boy died the next day. This lesson in Human frailties made a huge impact on Worf's nascent character. His self-control, interpreted by some as part of his Klingon heritage, was a large factor in his serious demeanor. (TNG: "Family", "New Ground"; DS9: "Let He Who Is Without Sin...")

The Rozhenko family eventually moved to Earth, where Sergey frequently took Nikolai and Worf camping in the Ural Mountains. At night, Worf often listened raptly to the sound of wolves howling in the distance. (DS9: "Change of Heart")

Coming of age
At fifteen years of age, in 2355, Worf voyaged to Qo'noS, where he stayed with cousins of the House of Mogh. There, he made the formal declaration of his intent to become a warrior and performed the Rite of Ascension. During the ceremony, Worf was presented with a well-forged knife, a gift from a Klingon who had known Mogh. Seeing the Great Domes of Qo'noS made him feel at home, but his kin rejected his marked Human taint. (TNG: "The Icarus Factor", "Rightful Heir"; DS9: "The Sword of Kahless")

Worf fasted for three days before undertaking the Rite of MajQa. After six days of meditation in the volcanic Caves of No'Mat, the legendary Klingon warrior Kahless the Unforgettable appeared to Worf in a vision and prophesied that Worf would do something that no other Klingon had ever done before. (TNG: "Birthright, Part I"; DS9: "The Sword of Kahless")

After Worf returned to Earth, he pondered the meaning of his words and wondered what lay ahead. When he grew old enough, he joined Starfleet, the first Klingon to ever do so. For a time, Worf believed he had fulfilled his destiny this way, though he later wondered if there was not something else yet after recovering the Sword of Kahless in 2372. (DS9: "The Sword of Kahless")

Service aboard the USS Enterprise-D
Lt. jg Worf at conn in 2364
In 2364, Lieutenant junior grade Worf was assigned as a command division bridge officer on the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D), under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (see Friendships: Jean-Luc Picard). Worf spent most of his first year on the Enterprise-D as a relief officer for the conn and other bridge stations. (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint", "The Naked Now", "Angel One", "Too Short a Season")

Worf assisting Admiral Mark Jameson in 2364
Worf was permitted a variation from the Starfleet uniform dress code, and wore a Klingon warrior's sash, sometimes called a baldric by Humans, over his regular duty uniform. (Star Trek: The Next Generation; Star Trek: Deep Space Nine; Star Trek: Insurrection) Worf's quarters were on Deck 7, in Section 25 Baker until 2370, when he moved to Deck 2, Room 2713. (TNG: "Rightful Heir", "Phantasms")

Lieutenant Worf in 2366
Following the death of Natasha Yar at the hands of the Armus entity, Worf became acting security chief. In 2365, Worf transferred to the operations division and officially became the Enterprise-D's chief tactical officer and security chief. He was promoted to the rank of full lieutenant in 2366. After seven years of service aboard the starship, Worf rose in rank to lieutenant commander in 2371. (TNG: "Skin of Evil", "The Child", "Evolution"; Star Trek Generations)

During these years of service, Worf's record was marred by a single reprimand, earned when he killed Duras in an honor duel after the latter killed Worf's mate, K'Ehleyr. Killing Duras directly affected the ascension of a new Klingon Chancellor after the death of K'mpec. (TNG: "Reunion")

Borg encounters
Worf and his security team were the first Starfleet officers in over two centuries to engage Borg drones in combat when two boarded his ship. Worf, along with Commander William T. Riker and Lieutenant Commander Data were the first officers to infiltrate a Borg cube, gathering the first real clues about the true nature of the new threat. (TNG: "Q Who")

Fighting a Borg invasion
Worf played a significant role in repelling the Borg invasion of the Federation in 2366. When the Enterprise-D engaged the Borg cube, he was unable to prevent the abduction of Picard when drones appeared on the bridge. On Riker's orders, Worf and Data boarded the cube, and were able to retrieve Picard, allowing Dr. Crusher to restore their captain's Humanity. It was one of the most dangerous missions of Worf's career, but six years later, he likened the exploits of his companions to the sagas of ancient warriors. (TNG: "The Best of Both Worlds", "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II"; DS9: "The Way of the Warrior")

Regardless of his optimism, in 2368, Worf was wary enough of a wounded and isolated Borg drone that he recommended killing it on sight, but his words went unheeded. The decision to rehabilitate the drone and return him to the collective nearly proved disastrous. (TNG: "I Borg", "Descent")

Q encounters
Like so many who encountered the trickster, Worf immediately developed a strong antipathy towards Q.

"I am not a merry man!"
In his visits, Q frequently took pleasure in teasing Worf, to whom Q referred as "micro brain." When Q forced the Enterprise-D crew to play out a detailed Robin Hood fantasy scenario, Worf found himself portraying the character Will Scarlet. 

When stripped of his powers from the Q Continuum, Q desperately asked how he could prove to the Enterprise-D crew that he was, indeed, mortal. Worf helpfully suggested, "Die," much to the amusement of others present on the bridge. (TNG: "Hide and Q", "Qpid", "Deja Q")

Klingon affairs
Worf and Gowron in 2372
Worf's exposure to Klingon society began in earnest, in his time aboard the Enterprise-D. In a few short years, the forgotten orphan from the House of Mogh was a player in the highest levels of the Empire's politics.

In 2364, the Enterprise-D rescued three Klingons from a disabled cargo ship, and for the first time in nearly ten years, Worf spent time in the company of (renegade) Klingon warriors. One of the rescued warriors was mortally wounded, and Worf joined in the Klingon death ritual for Kunivas, exposing non-Klingons to the event for the first time. The charismatic Korris tried to enlist Worf in taking the starship, but could not budge the officer's loyalty. In addition, Commander K'Nera also offered Worf a place in the Klingon Defense Forces, but was politely declined. (TNG: "Heart of Glory")

More than twenty years after the Khitomer Massacre, the honor of the House of Mogh was called into question in 2366. Worf's brother, Kurn, brought the news that Duras, of the rival House of Duras, had accused Mogh of betraying the Empire by facilitating the Romulan attack on the Khitomer colony. Worf appeared before the Klingon High Council to protest their judgment of guilt, and provided evidence that would have exonerated his father. Chancellor K'mpec dismissed Worf's defense, knowing the true traitor of Khitomer was Duras' father, Ja'rod. Considering the cost of his appeal and revelation of the truth – Duras' powerful clan inciting a civil war, and his intention to kill Kurn – Worf kept his silence and accepted a discommendation that ruined his name throughout the Empire. (TNG: "Sins of the Father")

A year later, Chancellor K'mpec was dying, and he asked Picard to serve as the Arbiter of Succession. The event coincided with Worf's reunion with K'Ehleyr, an iconoclastic ambassador and Worf's former lover. K'Ehleyr took this opportunity to introduce their child, Alexander, to Worf.

The Sonchi ceremony over the body of K'mpec was interrupted by an attempt to assassinate Gowron. The contenders were offended by the dishonored Worf presenting the result of the Enterprise-D's investigation, but Worf revealed evidence that implicated Duras. Concurrently, K'Ehleyr discovered the truth of Worf's discommendation as well as the scope of the House of Duras' treachery, but Duras confronted and murdered her. The question of succession was ultimately decided by Worf. Exercising his Right of Vengeance, he challenged Duras to a duel, defeating and killing him. The death of Duras allowed Gowron to become the new chancellor. (TNG: "Reunion")

Worf accepted a commission as a Klingon imperial officer
The civil war K'mpec had feared broke out in late 2367, when the House of Duras and allies rebelled against Chancellor Gowron's leadership by attacking Gowron's ship, the IKS Bortas. Worf felt it was his place to help his people, and resigned from Starfleet to side with Gowron. His influence proved instrumental in the war when he ordered Kurn to back Gowron. Worf served on Kurn's ship during the civil war, and fought at the Battle of Mempa, but soon found himself dissatisfied with the impulsive manner of Klingon society when off-duty, such as Kurn's association with officers who served the Duras family, despite the hostilities currently occurring between them. With help from Starfleet, the Romulan involvement was discovered, effectively ending it, enabling Gowron's forces to quickly end the war, and solidifying his position as chancellor. In appreciation for Worf's help, Chancellor Gowron restored honor to the House of Mogh, allocated Worf's brother, Kurn, a seat on the Klingon High Council, and gave Worf the life of Duras' illegitimate son, Toral. Worf, unwilling to kill an innocent boy, and recognizing that Toral was mainly a pawn of his aunts rather than a villain in himself, let Toral go and returned to Starfleet without incident. (TNG: "Redemption", "Redemption II")

In 2369, while the Enterprise was docked at Deep Space 9, Worf was met by a Yridian named Jaglom Shrek. Shrek told Worf that Mogh may not have died at Khitomer after all and that he might have still been alive, living with Romulans in a remote prison camp. Although initially uncomfortable about the possible dishonor that his family would face if Mogh had really been alive all this time, a conversation with Data about a recent "vision" he had had about his creator forced Worf to recognize that his own father was an important part of who he was, prompting him to meet Shrek and make the Yridian take him to the Carraya sector, where the prison camp was located.

On the surface of Carraya IV, Worf found L'Kor, now an old man. L'Kor informed Worf that his father had died at Khitomer, though a number of prisoners had been taken to this camp. Worf attempted to free the prisoners, but instead was taken captive. Inside the main prison camp, Worf found Klingons and Romulans living together in harmony – in their isolation, the Klingons had abandoned Klingon concepts of honor and had forgotten their warrior ways. The Klingon elders laughed in disbelief at Worf's assertion that Klingons were allies with the Federation, but the younger people were fascinated by his ways and his stories of Kahless. Despite attempts by Gi'ral to stop her daughter Ba'el's advances, the girl agreed to escape with Worf. However, when Worf found that Tokath, the Romulan leader of the camp, was Ba'el's father, he confronted Gi'ral about why she married a Romulan. Worf continued his influence on the camp's youth, and taught hunting to Toq. After catching an animal, they delivered it to the main hall as a feast. Tokath was horrified at the sight. Realizing that Worf would eventually sway the opinion of the other youths in the camp as he had Toq, Tokath sentenced Worf to death. However, Worf had exerted enough influence on the camp, and several members of the camp stood by Worf, willing to face execution rather than continue to live the way they had. Tokath was forced to let Worf return to the Enterprise. Worf though recognized the rare peace that had been established at the camp, and explained to the young people that wanted to leave that they must keep the camp and their parents a secret in order to honor them. (TNG: "Birthright, Part I", "Birthright, Part II")

Although a profound influence on the settlers of Carraya IV, Worf's visit also forced him to challenge his beliefs, feeling that his own faith in the legends he told the children was lacking compared to their own. To renew his faith, Worf decided to visit Boreth, and re-summon Kahless the Unforgettable. Kahless appeared before him for real – seemingly returned to lead the Empire once more. However, Worf was skeptical of the Klingon's authenticity, even as he admitted that he wanted to believe in Kahless' divinity. Gowron claimed that Kahless could not recall any of his legendary stories and challenged him in combat, which Kahless lost. The loss forced the clerics to reveal that this Kahless was a clone, leaving Worf strongly affected by the questions and doubts raised by the issue, before a conversation with Data prompted him to consider that it was possible to believe that something was more than its origins. Despite the discovery, Worf was instrumental in arranging for the clone to be installed as emperor to the Klingon people. The ceremonial position had not been held for centuries but Worf felt that the Klingon Empire had lost its way since Kahless' original teachings, and that the new emperor could bring further stability. Before the clone departed, Kahless consoled Worf's doubts by reflecting that the important thing was that all Klingons remember the teachings and message of the original Kahless, and as long as they remained true to those, it did not truly matter whether or not the original Kahless returned. (TNG: "Rightful Heir")

Other notable missions
Worf's first major task was to take command of the Enterprise-D saucer module and lead it to safety, when the ship separated prior to engaging Q for the first time. The order ran contrary to his nature (i.e. fleeing while his commanding officer was in danger) and Worf briefly objected until Picard reminded him of his duty. (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint", "All Good Things...")

Worf was present for the first Federation contact with the Romulans since the Tomed Incident. A mysterious third party's devastating attacks on Romulan Neutral Zone outposts alarmed the powers on either side of the border. Worf was enraged by the prospect of dealing with the race responsible for the Khitomer Massacre, and was rebuked by both Picard and the Romulan Commander Tebok, who urged, "Silence your dog, Captain." (TNG: "The Neutral Zone")

That same year, Worf was a member of the away team sent to investigate an Iconian gateway located in the Romulan Neutral Zone. The experience with Iconian technology served him well, many years later, in the Gamma Quadrant. On another away mission, to Theta VIII, he participated in a recreation of the pulp novel Hotel Royale. Worf also revealed his technical knowledge of energy vortices when the Enterprise was threatened with destruction by one. (TNG: "Contagion", "The Royale", "Time Squared"; DS9: "To the Death")

Both Picard and Riker independently had Worf in mind as their top choice for the ops position when Data was presumed dead. Worf noted to Deanna Troi that he had served in this capacity before. (TNG: "The Most Toys")

Worf helped expose Ardra as an impostor trying to take control of Ventax II, despite her attempts to take the form of Fek'lhr. (TNG: "Devil's Due")

At one point, the Enterprise was caught in an energy field which propelled the ship away from an M-class planet inhabited by the xenophobic Paxans. The energy field was designed to erase the memories of the crew. However, Worf's surgically-mended arm proved that something had happened at the Paxan homeworld, and that someone had deliberately erased their memories of the event. To appease the Paxans, the crew agreed to have their memories erased again, only this time, no clues were to be left. (TNG: "Clues")

A month later, the Enterprise became trapped in the Tyken's Rift, while trying to find the USS Brattain. The insanity and fear brought out by the Tyken's Rift caused Worf to nearly kill himself with a ceremonial knife. (TNG: "Night Terrors")

When Kieran MacDuff altered the memories of the crew and the computer (including Data's) with a plasma energy beam, Worf temporarily took command of the Enterprise, because his sash gave the crew the mistaken impression that he was the highest-ranking officer. After he learned his true rank, he apologized to Picard for his assumption of authority, but Picard assured him that no blame was necessary, as they were all making the best they could of a difficult situation. (TNG: "Conundrum")

In 2368, when the Enterprise was disabled by quantum filaments, Worf was entrusted with a makeshift infirmary in Ten Forward. During the incident, Keiko O'Brien went into labor, and Worf had to assist with her giving birth to Molly. He remembered the incident for years, and bristled when he found out she was pregnant again, while they both were on Deep Space 9, determining to make sure he was on leave when she gave birth so he wouldn't be in a position to have to assist again. (TNG: "Disaster"; DS9: "Accession")

In 2369, Worf was assigned by Admiral Alynna Nechayev to infiltrate Celtris III. Starfleet Intelligence had discovered bursts of theta-band subspace emissions from the planet, indicating an illegal metagenic weapon in operation. Worf, Dr. Crusher, and Captain Picard were part of the intelligence team sent to investigate. After Picard was captured by Gul Madred, Worf and Crusher escaped back to the rendezvous point, where they informed Captain Jellico of the situation. (TNG: "Chain of Command, Part I", "Chain of Command, Part II")

Later that year, Worf, along with the rest of the Enterprise crew, conducted a mission to aid a stranded Romulan Warbird. Creatures existing outside of the normal space-time continuum had assumed Romulan form and had used the Warbird's warp chamber as a gestation chamber for their offspring. Commander Riker ordered a power transfer beam engaged, to recharge the Romulan ship disturbing the creatures. This caused time on both ships to stop, locking each crew in temporal stasis. Worf had been in the transporter room, to lead the rescue effort bringing injured Romulans to the Enterprise. Captain Picard as well as Lieutenant Commanders Data, La Forge, and Counselor Troi were on their way back to the ship. When Picard went to the transporter room to examine the control panel, he found Worf at the controls and politely said, "Excuse me, Mr. Worf," even though the Klingon could not respond. (TNG: "Timescape")

"We were like warriors from the ancient sagas. There was nothing we could not do." - Worf
Worf, through the use of his Klingon calisthenics program, helped Byleth, an Iyaaran ambassador, understand the emotions of antagonism, something the Iyaaran culture had no natural understanding of. (TNG: "Liaisons")

Worf in 2371
On stardate 47391.2, Worf began moving between many different alternative realities after flying through a quantum fissure in the shuttlecraft Curie. He experienced several unexplained discontinuities in events against his memory (particularly regarding his attendance and victory at a bat'leth tournament on Forcas III), and it was eventually discovered that Worf was not native to the universe he was currently in – a universe where the Federation was at war with the Bajorans, where he was a commander and first officer of the Enterprise-D and married to Deanna Troi, with whom he had two children. He was eventually returned to his original reality, apparently the only person to retain any memory of his journey. (TNG: "Parallels")

Worf surviving the destruction of the Enterprise
Following Worf's promotion to lieutenant commander in 2371, he was instrumental in a battle that ensued after the Duras sisters attacked the Enterprise. He first remembered a critical flaw that had caused their class of Bird-of-Prey to be retired and, when Data then made use of this flaw to remotely cause the vessel to cloak, Worf destroyed the Bird-of-Prey with a single torpedo hit. Unfortunately, due to damage sustained in the battle, the Enterprise stardrive section was destroyed, with the separated saucer section crashing on Veridian III, damaged beyond repair. (Star Trek Generations)

Service on Deep Space 9
Worf in 2372
While awaiting reassignment following the destruction of the Enterprise, Worf took an extended leave of absence from Starfleet to evaluate his future. He returned his son to Earth to live with the Rozhenkos while he himself took refuge on Boreth. (DS9: "The Way of the Warrior")

Meanwhile, on the other side of the Federation, Captain Benjamin Sisko and the crew of Deep Space 9 were having trouble keeping order with the Klingons present at the station. When the treaty with the Klingon Empire was threatened during the Klingons' invasion of Cardassia in 2372, Sisko stated, "Curzon told me once that in the long run, the only people who can really handle Klingons are Klingons." It was at this time he requested Worf's help.

Worf again became a player in galactic politics as the Federation tried to avert war between the Klingon Empire and the Cardassian Union. Worf was the Federation's best link to Chancellor Gowron and a meeting between them was arranged. He was asked to resign from Starfleet and join Gowron on the Klingon campaign to invade Cardassia. Worf felt the war was wrong and that it was incompatible with his loyalties to the Federation. As a result, Gowron threatened to strip Worf and his family of their honor, confiscate their lands, and treat them as traitors to the Klingon Empire. When Worf again refused, Gowron made good on his threat.

Worf, with Jadzia Dax and Kira Nerys
The Klingons failed to bring down the Cardassian government with the Federation protecting them and an enraged Gowron withdrew from the Khitomer Accords, making the Klingons an enemy of the Federation. Following the mission, Worf considered resigning from Starfleet to take a berth on a Nyberrite Alliance cruiser. After learning this, Sisko, reflecting to Worf that he had also considered leaving Starfleet after his wife's death, suggested that Worf was just trying to escape the memory of the Enterprise's loss rather than Starfleet itself. Sisko then offered Worf a position as the strategic operations officer, which Worf humbly accepted, making his primary duty to co-ordinate all Starfleet activity within the Bajoran sector, not to handle security matters on Deep Space 9, which was Odo's responsibility. This new assignment had Worf once again wearing command division red. (DS9: "The Way of the Warrior", "Hippocratic Oath")

Worf clashes with Odo over the security on DS9
When the USS Orinoco was sabotaged by the True Way in 2372, Worf, along with Major Kira Nerys, Sisko, Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax, and Chief Miles O'Brien were lost in the shuttlecraft's transporter. However, Odo and Michael Eddington managed to save their transporter signatures on the station's computers. The character data was saved in the holosuite (where Julian Bashir and Elim Garak were running a holosuite simulation). Worf's character data was superimposed onto Duchamps, a holosuite character who played the henchman to Dr. Noah. (DS9: "Our Man Bashir")

Worf's quarters on DS9 were on Level 3, Section 27, Room 19. (DS9: "Inquisition") He also lived on the Defiant for a period of time after his quarters got robbed by a Dopterian. Worf took the Dopterian into custody and complained about the robbery, after which Odo read him some of the security breaches that occurred during his service aboard the Enterprise-D. (DS9: "Bar Association"; TNG: "A Matter of Time", "Rascals") When Worf married Jadzia Dax, he moved into her quarters, which were located in the habitat ring, Section 25 Alpha. (DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited", "Resurrection")

USS Defiant missions
In addition to his role aboard Deep Space 9, Worf, as the most senior Starfleet officer under Sisko, also served as Executive Officer of the USS Defiant. Therefore, whenever Sisko was not commanding the Defiant, Worf got a chance to demonstrate his command expertise. One of the first missions he commanded was a science mission headed by Lenara Kahn. A Trill science team was attempting to create Starfleet's first artificially-created stable wormhole. Worf found it hard to be excited about a science mission, claiming that his dreams were more exciting. (DS9: "Rejoined")

While beside a gas giant in the Gamma Quadrant, where the Defiant was escorting Quark to continue negotiations with the Karemma, the Jem'Hadar opened fire on the Karemma ship and the Defiant as punishment for their treason. Captain Sisko was severely injured in the incident, leaving Worf in command. Taking command in engineering (the bridge had been damaged by Jem'Hadar fire), Worf found many engineers (especially Muniz and Stevens) unaccustomed to his authoritarian style of command. After receiving advice from Chief O'Brien, Worf undertook a more interactive approach. Better able to work under this style of command, Muniz and Stevens were able to devise a way to destroy the Jem'Hadar attack ship. By modifying the main deflector, the Defiant successfully defeated the Jem'Hadar. (DS9: "Starship Down")

On a subsequent occasion, Worf commanded the Defiant on a mission to escort Cardassian freighters across a volatile sector of Klingon space. After being fired upon by Klingon warships using a tactic of continually decloaking to fire and then recloaking, a Klingon ship decloaked directly ahead of the Defiant and Worf ordered it destroyed. However, this ship was a Klingon civilian transport ship. The Klingon Advocate Ch'Pok demanded that Worf be extradited to the Klingon Empire for punishment.

The Federation decided to stage an extradition hearing with Admiral T'Lara as chair, Sisko as defense, and Ch'Pok as prosecution. Had it not been for Odo's discovery that there were no civilians on the destroyed ship, Worf would have been extradited to the Klingon Empire to face execution. After the court martial, which the defense won, Worf remarked about the difficulty of command. Sisko replied, "Wait until you get four pips on your collar. You'll wish you had gone into botany." (DS9: "Rules of Engagement")

Following a year of hostilities and border skirmishes between the Federation and Klingons (see Federation-Klingon War), Odo discovered that Gowron might have been replaced by a Changeling. In order to establish whether Gowron was a shapeshifter, Starfleet Command ordered Sisko to lead a team (which included Worf) to expose Gowron as a shapeshifter. The team posed as Klingon warriors being inducted into the Order of the Bat'leth. Each team member was to plant polaron emitters that, when activated, would force a shapeshifter to lose its shape. Worf initially found it difficult to turn the team into convincing Klingons. However, Sisko helped him refocus, and with practice, the team pulled through. The plan worked out relatively well at first, but just when Sisko was ready to activate the polaron emitters, Martok, chief military adviser and overseer of the Cardassian invasion, recognized Sisko through his Klingon disguise, and the entire team was thrown into prison. While incarcerated, the team managed to explain their mission to Martok. It turned out that Martok had always suspected that Gowron may have been a Changeling, but he was waiting for the right time to expose him. With the polaron emitters destroyed, Worf decided that the only way to expose Gowron as a shapeshifter was to get him to spill blood. Once released by Martok, Worf fought Gowron in a duel. Gowron's Klingon honor and behavior led Odo to find it was not Gowron, but Martok who was the Dominion Changeling agent. After he was destroyed by the Klingon warriors, it was discovered that his mission was to destabilize relations between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. Worf's assistance in uncovering the Dominion presence as the common enemy incidentally helped to restore peace between the Federation and Klingon Empire. (DS9: "Broken Link", "Apocalypse Rising")

Some months later, the Defiant was tasked with a mission of sending the Bajoran Orb of Time back to the station. However, Defiant passenger Arne Darvin had other ideas; he used the Orb to travel back to 2268, to the time of Captain Kirk and the first USS Enterprise, and to the year that the tribbles had invaded Klingon space. Darvin's plot was to kill Captain Kirk and eliminate the tribbles before they had a chance to invade Klingon space. While searching for Darvin, Worf (along with Odo, Bashir, and O'Brien) encountered Klingons scarred by the augment virus of the 22nd century. When Bashir and O'Brien asked how the augmented people could be Klingons, Worf merely responded, "We do not discuss it with outsiders." The crew apprehended Darvin on Deep Space Station K-7, and returned to the present. (TOS: "The Trouble with Tribbles"; DS9: "Trials and Tribble-ations")

The Dominion War
In 2373, Elim Garak received an encoded transmission from his mentor, Enabran Tain. It stated that he had survived the Battle of the Omarion Nebula and was being held by the Dominion in the Gamma Quadrant. Garak convinced Sisko that he could enter Dominion space but only under supervision from Worf. In order to avoid detection while in Dominion space, Worf decided to hide in a nearby nebula. The diversion proved to be a bad idea, as that nebula housed the first Dominion invasion fleet, on its way to invading the Alpha Quadrant. Worf knew that they were planning to enter the wormhole, and that the Dominion War was about to begin. Before they were captured by the fleet, Worf managed to transmit a message to the wormhole relay station about the impending invasion. (DS9: "In Purgatory's Shadow")

Worf and Martok in the Dominion internment camp
Worf and Garak were taken to Internment Camp 371, where they discovered Enabran Tain, the real General Martok, and surprisingly, the real Julian Bashir. Bashir had been captured for a month and had been replaced by a Changeling infiltrator. All the prisoners knew they had to escape, to warn DS9 about the Changeling. Although Tain died at the camp shortly thereafter, Garak devised a plan to modify Tain's transmitter to contact the runabout in orbit and escape from the internment camp. The transmitter was tucked away in a cramped compartment, and Garak had to overcome his acute claustrophobia to complete the modifications. Worf and Martok commended Garak's courage, stating, "There is no greater enemy than one's own fears." During this time, to distract the Jem'Hadar guards, Worf entered into combat with each of the Jem'Hadar guards in turn, earning the respect and admiration of General Martok in the process, even winning the respect of Jem'Hadar First Ikat'ika, who yielded their final fate when he recognized that Worf's refusal to surrender meant that killing Worf would not be a victory. Once the prisoners escaped, they managed to warn DS9 that Bashir had been replaced by a Changeling. Kira managed to destroy the Bashir Changeling before he could blow up the Bajoran sun. (DS9: "By Inferno's Light")

From then on to the end of the year, the Dominion sent weekly fleets through the wormhole to fortify the Cardassian sectors. Starfleet, needing to find a way to halt the buildup, decided to block the entrance to the wormhole with a minefield. Sisko assigned the Defiant under the command of Jadzia Dax to deploy a field of self-replicating mines, all of which needed to be deployed before any could be activated. Starfleet forces were unable to assist in the deployment, so the Defiant and the IKS Rotarran had to do it alone, and they only had one day to finish. Weyoun approached the station with three hundred Dominion and Cardassian ships, and when Sisko refused their ultimatum, Gul Dukat opened fire, starting the Second Battle of Deep Space 9 and the Dominion War. While the Dominion's firepower proved ineffective against the station's shields, Worf, in command of the station's weapons array, managed to destroy fifty ships, and the Rotarran helped protect the Defiant, so it could complete the minefield. With the minefield deployed and the station vastly outnumbered, Sisko ordered all Starfleet crew members to evacuate the station. Due to the conquest of DS9 by the Dominion, Worf had been assigned to the Rotarran as first officer. (DS9: "Call to Arms")

Unlike the rest of Starfleet, First Officer Worf, ever the warrior, relished the opportunity to engage in combat with the Dominion. A joint operation where the Defiant played a decoy to three Jem'Hadar attack ships allowed the Rotarran to decloak and help destroy those ships in the front line. However, both ships had been called back to Starbase 375 for retreat. By now, even Worf was beginning to lose morale due to the retreats from the Dominion. What the alliance needed was a victory, something that Sisko had been planning all along – Operation Return, the plan to retake Deep Space 9.

The original plan of taking three Federation fleets and a Klingon contingent were scuttled when Sisko received word that the minefield was about to come down. The Second and Fifth Fleets had to take Deep Space 9 themselves. Even so, Martok and Worf tried to convince Chancellor Gowron to send some ships to the battle. Although it took a long time, Gowron eventually realized that both an ally and enemy were telling him the same thing, so agreed to send the ships. Outside the Bajoran system, the Federation was on the verge of losing the battle (Sisko had fallen for a trap set by the Cardassians), but then Worf and Martok's Klingon forces entered at an opportune moment. They inflicted enough damage on the Dominion for the Defiant to break through the lines. The Defiant went on to retake the station and win the battle. When the Jem'Hadar took command of the Defiant, and the crew pretended to make repairs to the warp core for their captors, Worf made it appear he was repairing the plasma display console but was actually sending signals to the bridge to give command operations to Sisko from main engineering. (DS9: "Favor the Bold", "Sacrifice of Angels", "One Little Ship")

Some time thereafter, Worf earned a second serious blemish on his service record when he abandoned an important mission for Starfleet Intelligence to rescue Jadzia Dax, who he had married shortly after the retaking of the station. Though no formal charges were leveled, due to the secrecy of the mission, Sisko said, "This will go in your service record... and to be completely honest, you should know that they'll probably never give you a command of your own after this." (DS9: "Change of Heart")

Gowron fights Worf to the death in 2375
In 2375, Worf became disillusioned with Gowron's leadership. Gowron feared Martok's growing popularity and devised a plan to discredit Martok and end any potential threat to his authority. Gowron began ordering Martok on near-suicidal missions against Dominion forces, hoping that a string of defeats would weaken Martok's popularity and discredit him as a military leader. Recognizing that Gowron was jeopardizing the entire war effort, Worf tried to convince Martok that he should challenge Gowron for the leadership. After Martok refused, Worf decided to challenge Gowron himself, citing his faulty battle planning, his dishonorable conduct in trying to discredit Martok, and poor strategies at the later stages of the Dominion War. After a brief battle, Worf killed Gowron; by right, he was proclaimed the new chancellor of the Klingon High Council. However, Worf immediately gave his position to Martok. After the war, Martok asked that Worf be appointed Federation Ambassador to the Klingon Empire. Thereafter, Worf left Deep Space 9 to take his new post on Qo'noS. (DS9: "Tacking Into the Wind", "What You Leave Behind")

Service aboard the USS Enterprise-E
Worf aboard the Enterprise-E
In 2373, Worf was ordered to take the USS Defiant and join the fleet of ships set to intercept a Borg cube in the Typhon sector on a course for Earth. Along with the USS Bozeman and USS Lexington, the Defiant was heavily damaged by the cube and Worf was considering ramming the Borg, when the USS Enterprise-E came to Worf's rescue. The Enterprise-E took on board the survivors of the Defiant, including Worf. Reunited with his old crewmates, Worf assisted in destroying the cube with the tactical information divulged by Picard. After it was destroyed, Worf discovered that a sphere was traveling back in time to 2063, in an attempt to prevent First Contact between Humans and Vulcans. After destroying the Borg sphere, Worf successfully helped destroy the Enterprise's deflector dish, which the Borg were turning into an interplexing beacon, and prevent them from changing history. (Star Trek: First Contact)

Lieutenant Commander Worf protecting the Ba'ku people in 2375
In 2375, Worf visited the Federation colony on Manzar to establish a new defense perimeter against the Dominion. At this opportunity, however, he visited his old friends on the Enterprise-E, which was on a diplomatic mission nearby. For a brief period, Worf rejoined his old crew to reveal Admiral Dougherty's conspiracy concerning the Ba'ku relocation. (Star Trek: Insurrection)

In 2379, Worf rejoined his old crewmates from the Enterprise-E on Earth when he attended William Riker and Deanna Troi's wedding ceremony. Following the Earth wedding and while en route to a second ceremony on Betazed, the second wedding was postponed as the Enterprise-E detected positronic signals from the Kolarin system. Following the discovery that the source of the positronic signals was a Soong-type android, B-4, Vice Admiral Kathryn Janeway of Starfleet Command assigned the Enterprise-E to Romulus to begin new peace talks with the new Praetor of the Romulan Star Empire, Shinzon, who was a Human clone of Picard. The peace offer turned out to be a trap and, in the end, Worf, along with the Enterprise crew, had to face Shinzon and the Remans together with the Romulans, after which Worf finally admitted that the Romulans had fought with honor, possibly overcoming his lifelong grudge towards them. (Star Trek Nemesis)

Later life
In 2399, a photo of Worf was shown on an FNN media broadcast prior to a holo-interview with Admiral Picard. Soon after, this retired Admiral Picard still considered Worf a loyal colleague who would not hesitate to join him on a mission if asked. (PIC: "Remembrance", "Maps and Legends")

Personality
Worf's intense desire to become a part of his lost culture was matched by enduring loyalty to the world that adopted him in his darkest hour. Those impulses forged a character of indomitable courage and integrity, uncompromising idealism, and a more-Klingon-than-Klingon facade that was occasionally lifted to reveal romanticism, gentleness, and humor. With his limited contact with his own people, Worf subscribed to an idealized version of Klingon culture, which the real thing sometimes failed to live up to, particularly in the area of politics.

While coming from a species frequently regarded as aggressive and enthusiastically boisterous, Worf often gave the first impression of being a rather dour and reserved, though surly and even vaguely threatening, individual. Beverly Crusher described Worf as a tall Klingon who rarely smiled. Likewise, Jadzia Dax referred to Worf as a man difficult to get along with, but she did see him as a good person. Jadzia admitted that whenever it came to Klingon culture, Worf would always get misty-eyed with sentiment. (TNG: "Remember Me"; DS9: "Children of Time", "You Are Cordially Invited")

Worf's conservative nature and respect for tradition occasionally brought him down on the side of issues that conflicted with the views of his friends. Antipathy for his species' historical enemy made him refuse to donate tissue from his body that may have saved a dying Romulan officer in 2366. He helped Rear Admiral Norah Satie uncover treason among the crew of the Enterprise-D in 2367, leading to unfounded accusations against Captain Picard and crewman Simon Tarses. After the witch-hunt was stopped, Worf apologized for the trouble he helped cause, but Picard commended his vigilance, reminding him of the difficulty of spotting a villain who operates with such subtlety. During what should have been a romantic vacation on the pleasure world of Risa, Worf temporarily joined Pascal Fullerton's New Essentialists Movement, helping them to sabotage Risa's weather control system. (TNG: "The Enemy", "The Drumhead"; DS9: "Let He Who Is Without Sin...")

Worf's reputation for a lack of humor inspired regular teasing from those close enough to get away with it, like Riker, or too powerful to care, like Q. It pleased Martok and Jadzia Dax to no end whenever they could squeeze a joke from the tight-lipped Klingon. Worf denied his lack of humor to Jadzia once, claiming that he was quite amusing on the Enterprise-D, causing her to theorize that "it must have been one dull ship." (DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited", "Change of Heart") Lwaxana Troi occasionally called Worf "Mister Woof", initially by mistake. Worf did not appreciate the misnomer. (TNG: "Half a Life", "Cost of Living", "Dark Page")

Although shy about it, Worf enjoyed singing Klingon operas. While at a bar on Qualor II in 2368, Worf requested that Amarie play Aktuh and Maylota and briefly graced the patrons with his baritone voice. He was stranded for some time in an escape pod in 2375, and passed the time taking advantage of the favorable acoustics. Though he initially denied the private performance, Ezri Dax guessed that he had been singing Shevok'tah gish. Chagrined, he admitted to actually singing Gav'ot toH'va, a piece with rather ambitious solos. (TNG: "Unification II"; DS9: "Penumbra")

The combination of his Human upbringing and Klingon taste buds made for an unusual palate. Among traditional Klingon foods like live gagh for breakfast, he loved his adoptive mother's rokeg blood pie that she learned how to prepare just for him. (TNG: "Family") Guinan introduced Worf to prune juice, a treat that he relied on with regularity for satisfaction, which he refer to as a "warrior's drink". (TNG: "Yesterday's Enterprise") Riker once prepared scrambled 'Owon eggs for friends in his quarters, and while the Humans regarded the result as tasting terrible, Worf (after a careful sniff) ate his with gusto, simply remarking "delicious". (TNG: "Time Squared") He also held this opinion of a pasta al fiorella from DS9's replimat, which Geordi La Forge considered to taste like liquid polymer. (TNG: "Birthright, Part I") He did not react well to Romulan ale, and agreed with its prohibition. (DS9: "Inquisition"; TNG: "Parallels"; Star Trek Nemesis)

Physicality
Worf was an admirer of Natasha Yar and her martial arts skills, and joined her on the ship's parrises squares team. Three days before she died, Worf placed a wager that Yar would be victorious in an upcoming martial arts competition. (TNG: "11001001", "Skin of Evil")
