<html><p>Worf helped Sisko capture and apprehend the Maquis leader, Michael Eddington. He helped reorganize the Defiant after its computers were disabled by Eddington's cascade virus. Worf also modified and fired a quantum torpedo so it released a trilithium resin into the atmosphere of Solosos III, the act of which forced Eddington to surrender. Worf had assumed the quantum torpedo was going to be used on Eddington's Maquis fighter. (DS9: "For the Uniform")

When Garak persuaded Sisko that he could enter the Gamma Quadrant to search for Enabran Tain, he only allowed him to do so if Worf could accompany him. Later, Worf asked Sisko if he could join General Martok on the Rotarran; Sisko needed a good officer like Worf defending the station, but Worf described his moment of tova'dok with Martok and convinced Sisko to allow Worf to join the Rotarran. He did not oppose Martok's request that Worf remain on the Rotarran even after the Operation Return, knowing that he was the only officer he knew that could never get enough work. (DS9: "In Purgatory's Shadow", "Soldiers of the Empire")

When Sisko was reassigned to Starbase 375 in 2374, leaving Jadzia Dax to command the Defiant to the Argolis Cluster, both he and Worf were concerned for the safety of the ship and her crew. Sisko reassured Worf that Dax wanted to get back for the wedding, while Worf suggested that Sisko get some rest. (DS9: "Behind the Lines")

Sisko took part in Worf's Kal'Hyah ceremony, and tried his best to last the entire four days. He motivated O'Brien, Bashir, and Alexander throughout the entire four day ceremony. After Sirella called off the wedding, Sisko convinced both officers that they were in love and that they could not call off the wedding. (DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited")

Worf took command of the Defiant, searching for survivors of the USS Honshu, gunned down by Cardassian destroyers. Two of the survivors were Sisko and Dukat, trapped near the Badlands. When Kira relayed Starfleet's orders to call off the search for Sisko, the message came through garbled with interference. Despite Bashir's claims that the message was too unclear to understand, Worf knew what the message ordered, and said it would be dishonorable to disobey them. Fortunately, Dukat relayed a distress signal detailing the location of Sisko. (DS9: "Waltz")

Worf found the captain to be intimidating, but he kept it secret from Sisko. It was Ezri Dax who had to reveal this fact to Sisko, much to Sisko's amusement. (DS9: "Afterimage")

Worf participated in Sisko's grudge game against former Academy classmate, Captain Solok. Although he performed well in training, Worf received three strikes when he faced the Logicians. Both Sisko and Worf were enraged that he did not obtain a single run. (DS9: "Take Me Out to the Holosuite")

Miles O'Brien
Worf with Chief O'Brien aboard the Enterprise-D
Worf knew Chief O'Brien from his early days on the Enterprise-D, although their relationship was that of a noncom and his superior. However, they were both participants in the crew's poker games. O'Brien was also a participant in Wesley Crusher's Age of Ascension recreation for Worf, where he commented on the power of the Klingon painstiks. (TNG: "The Emissary", "The Icarus Factor")

Although Worf had to man the bridge at O'Brien's wedding to Keiko, following Data's observation that the gift should reflect the personality of the giver, he gave O'Brien a Klingon weapon as a wedding gift. In 2368, when the Enterprise was damaged by a quantum filament, Worf was forced to deliver Keiko's baby daughter, Molly. He humorously noted that Molly resembled Miles. (TNG: "Data's Day", "Disaster")

O'Brien greets Worf upon his arrival at Deep Space 9
The friendship really took off when Worf transferred to Deep Space 9. O'Brien was the first person to greet Worf when he arrived. Later he introduced Worf to the game of darts, describing it as "poker, but with pointed tips." Once Worf accepted the role of strategic operations officer (with a change of uniform from yellow to red), O'Brien commented how good Worf looked in red. (DS9: "The Way of the Warrior")

Worf gets into a fight with O'Brien
When the Defiant was damaged by the Jem'Hadar during their Karemma negotiations, and Worf found commanding the engineering team difficult, it was O'Brien who helped Worf take a different approach to command. (DS9: "Starship Down")

When Worf discovered that the O'Briens were having another child, he altered his holiday plans to coincide with the birth, just so he wouldn't have to deliver O'Briens' baby like he did with Molly. (DS9: "Accession")

During Worf's trial that demanded his extradition to the Klingon Empire, O'Brien described Worf as "an honorable man". In turn, Worf described O'Brien as an "outstanding officer" and a friend, relaying their mutual respect out loud. (DS9: "Rules of Engagement")

Worf incited a fight with the Jem'Hadar, Toman'torax, in retaliation for threatening O'Brien. (DS9: "To the Death")

In 2373, Worf participated in recovering a Jem'Hadar ship from Torga IV, the last mission of Enrique Muniz who was severely wounded with a Jem'Hadar weapon. Although Worf believed that Muniz would not survive his wounds, O'Brien did not agree and clashed with Worf's pessimism escalating into a near brawl between the two. However, Worf was later proved right and Muniz did succumb to his wounds. Once the mission was over, Worf found the chief at the casket of Muniz, holding somewhat of an improvised wake for him. Worf offered to performed the Klingon tradition of ak'voh with the chief as they would both "keep the predators away." The two men did not speak of their hostility, just held vigil over Muniz. (DS9: "The Ship")

O'Brien politely refused Worf's offer of help when Keiko, possessed by a Pah-wraith, fell down the Promenade crossway. (DS9: "The Assignment")

O'Brien had to undergo a ritual fasting with Julian Bashir and Sisko as part of Worf's Kal'Hyah ceremony, which was different than what he thought it would be. He couldn't last the four days (even joining Bashir in vowing to kill Worf at one point), and when he heard the wedding ceremony was called off, he and Bashir immediately ordered a large feast of Earth and Bajoran food. However, Sisko stopped them and helped put the wedding back on track. (DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited")

At one point, while watching Jadzia and Quark playing a game of tongo against each other and a group of Ferengi waiters, Worf made a bet with O'Brien that Jadzia had the game in hand. He wagered that if she won, O'Brien would owe Worf a bottle of bloodwine. If Jadzia lost, however, Worf would then owe the chief a bottle of Irish whiskey. In the end, however, Worf ended up saying that he would need time to come up with O'Brien's payment. (DS9: "Change of Heart")

Worf was more than happy to babysit Kirayoshi while the O'Briens were busy taking care of Molly, who traveled through an ancient time portal. Once Kirayoshi was returned to his parents, he chose to honor their dinner invitation rather than go in a holosuite. (DS9: "Time's Orphan")

After Jadzia Dax died at the hands of Gul Dukat, O'Brien was one of the first people who attempted to cheer up Worf. While drinking bloodwine and reminiscing about old crewmates (most notably Reginald Barclay), O'Brien found out what was bothering Worf – the fact that his wife did not die an honorable death, and thus could not enter Sto-vo-kor. O'Brien then directed Martok to help Worf, who assigned him the mission to destroy the Monac IV fleet yards. (DS9: "Tears of the Prophets", "Image in the Sand", "Shadows and Symbols")

It was O'Brien who helped Worf ease his hostility to Ezri. Over a bottle of bloodwine, O'Brien asked how Jadzia would feel if she knew how poorly Worf treated Ezri. When Worf claimed that there was no way to know, O'Brien refuted the claim, suggesting he talk to the one person Worf had been avoiding. After keeping her in Starfleet, Worf and O'Brien attended Ezri's promotion party. (DS9: "Afterimage")

When O'Brien's authorization code was used to access sixteen cases of bloodwine sent to Martok by Sirella, Martok and Worf had to quiz O'Brien on where the cases went. O'Brien had to explain to Worf and Martok that Nog must have taken the bloodwine to barter for a graviton stabilizer. Worf and Martok gave O'Brien one day to find the bloodwine. Fortunately, Nog returned with 16 cases of 2309 bloodwine bought from his cousin Gant, an even better vintage than the ones he took. Both Klingons gave O'Brien a bottle of the bloodwine as an "apology". (DS9: "Treachery, Faith and the Great River")

Ezri Dax
Ezri Dax's relationship with Worf did not go quite as smoothly as Jadzia's, despite many of Jadzia's friends and colleagues quickly accepting the presence of a new Dax in their lives. Initially, Worf wanted nothing to do with her, or even Dr. Bashir, considering Ezri's presence and her relationship with Bashir an affront to his wife's memory. However, he soon realized that his actions were more of an affront, and relations between them began to warm. (DS9: "Afterimage")

During the latter half of the year, Worf commanded the IKS Koraga when it was destroyed by the Dominion; his escape pod was rescued by Ezri, with whom Worf was captured by the Breen shortly after an implied sexual encounter. After undergoing an interrogation (which included killing one of the clones of Weyoun), Worf and Ezri were freed by Legate Damar as part of his resistance to the Dominion, the two subsequently putting aside the last of their issues regarding Worf's relationship with Jadzia as Ezri began to accept her own feelings for Bashir. (DS9: "Penumbra", "Strange Bedfellows")

It was Ezri who pointed out to Worf how deep corruption ran in the Klingon Empire, asking him who the last chancellor he respected was. She finished by asking what hope there was for the Empire if such an honorable man as him was willing to accept leadership like Gowron's, prompting his decision to challenge Gowron to a duel and kill him. (DS9: "Tacking Into the Wind")

Kor
Although Kurn's new life gave him a chance to regain honor, Worf had to continue living with his dishonor. Kor (considered a hero, according to Worf) offered him the perfect opportunity to regain his honor. Kor, who disliked the High Council enough to consider any enemy of it a friend, revealed to Worf that he and Jadzia knew the secret location of the legendary Sword of Kahless, stolen by Hur'q pillagers a millennium ago. If Worf could find the sword and present it to the present emperor it would almost certainly restore his honor among his people. Kor accepted Worf's request to join the expedition, knowing it would annoy Gowron.

Dax, Kor, and Worf find the Sword of Kahless
Although the antechamber that apparently held the sword had been ransacked, Worf discovered that a holographic projection hid the true chamber. With the help of some Hur'q DNA, Kor, Worf, and Dax gained access to the hidden chamber, where they found the legendary sword. Worf believed that the discovery of the sword was one of the events in his life that his vision of Kahless foretold him accomplishing. 

When the team exited the chamber, they came face-to-face with Toral, son of Duras, an individual whose life Worf had spared following the Klingon Civil War. After a brief battle with Toral and his bodyguards, the team made a dash back to the ship, being chased by Toral. However, while heading back to the ship, Kor and Worf had a difference of opinion about the sword. Worf was disgusted when Kor used the sword to eat a vole: "The sword is not something that you use to shovel food down your mouth." When it came time to sleep, Kor and Worf could not sleep, for fear that if they did sleep, the other would seize the opportunity to steal the sword and reap the glory. After a restless night, the team had to maneuver across a steep chasm. Kor lost his footing and nearly fell down the slope. Worf, barely able to hold onto Kor, told him to let go and drop onto a ledge beneath him. Kor, preferring to die rather than let go of the sword, refused and climbed back up with the help of Dax. Kor took a look at the ledge, and found that it was too small to support his weight. This proved too much for Kor, and he decided to fight Worf in battle. If it wasn't for Toral catching up to the team, they would have killed each other. After dealing with Toral, the team realized how much the sword was dividing the two Klingons. They decided that the Empire was not ready for the return of the sword, so they beamed it into space, to be lost until Klingons were ready for it. (DS9: "The Sword of Kahless")

In 2375, when Kor came to the station looking for command of a ship, Worf discovered that Martok held a personal grudge against Kor. Kor was responsible for striking Martok's name from the officers' list because his family was from the lowlands of Ketha Province, and due to his influence, Martok was barred from even enlisting as a common soldier. In order to mend ties between Martok and Kor, Worf managed to sneak him into the IKS Ch'Tang. The Ch'Tang was part of a small fleet assigned to raid the Dominion base on Trelka V. Kor was experiencing lapses in concentration, one of which nearly led to the destruction of the Ch'Tang. While trying to retreat from enemy space, the crew discovered they were being pursued by ten Jem'Hadar fighters. If the Ch'Tang could not find a way to delay the Jem'Hadar fighters, they would not be able to reach friendly space in time. Worf planned to use the IKS Ning'tao to divert the pursuers, a move that would be suicidal. However, before he could reach the transporter, Kor used a hypospray to take Worf's place. Although Kor did not return from the battle, he bought enough time for the Klingon fleet to escape. (DS9: "Once More Unto the Breach")

Alternate realities and timelines
Worf, governor of H'atoria
When the Ambassador-class starship USS Enterprise-C emerged from the temporal rift in 2366, it created an alternate timeline. In this new timeline the Federation had been at war with the Klingons. Natasha Yar wasn't killed by Armus on Vagra II and was still serving at tactical as the security chief of the ship. Worf's whereabouts, or if he was even alive, were unknown. (TNG: "Skin of Evil", "Yesterday's Enterprise")
In 2370, when he returned from a bat'leth tournament on Forcas III, Worf encountered a quantum fissure, and began switching places with other versions of himself in alternate quantum realities. In two realities he visited, he was married to Counselor Deanna Troi. In one of these realities, they had two children: Shannara and Eric-Christopher, whereas Alexander had never been born. It was in this same reality that Worf had been promoted to full commander and appointed first officer of the Enterprise-D under Captain Riker, Picard having been lost in the Borg encounter of 2367. An alternate Lieutenant Worf, who served on board the Enterprise-D from a reality where the Federation had been completely wiped out by the Borg, died when his ship exploded after being fired upon by the other Enterprise-D. All of the alternate versions were returned to their own realities when the fissure was sealed. (TNG: "Parallels")
In an alternate future, Worf had been reluctant to become involved with Troi, and her subsequent death led to a rift between William Riker and himself as a result. He later served as a member of the Klingon High Council, and was the governor of the Klingon colony of H'atoria. (TNG: "All Good Things...")
In an alternate timeline created by the Defiant's time travel back two hundred years, Jadzia Dax and Worf had married and fostered a large family whose descendants formed a significant part of a colony numbering eight thousand people, including Yedrin Dax and Brota. (DS9: "Children of Time")
In another alternate future, Worf had influence in the Klingon Empire during the early 25th century. (DS9: "The Visitor")
In yet another alternate future, Worf was killed on the floor of the High Council in 2410, while his son, Alexander, helplessly watched. (TNG: "Firstborn")
Holograms
A hologram of Worf created by Picard inside Moriarty's Enterprise-D program
Worf was holographically duplicated on a number of occasions. 

Lt. Reginald Barclay in 2366 recreated the entire crew of the Enterprise-D when he was suffering from holo-addiction. The recreation of Worf was present when Barclay said goodbye to his fantasies and deleted the programs. (TNG: "Hollow Pursuits")
Duchamps with Worf's appearance
In 2367, Barash created a holographic future version of the crew of the Enterprise-D on Alpha Onias III to keep Commander Riker there. This holoprogram took place in a fictional 2383 where Worf had been promoted to lieutenant commander and had become the operations officer. He had a scar from an unknown battle, a fact which Riker used to prove he was in a fantasy. (TNG: "Future Imperfect")
The James Moriarty hologram recreated the entire Enterprise-D in 2369 as part of a ploy to escape the holodeck. Captain Picard was forced to create the program Picard Delta One, another recreation of the Enterprise-D, within Moriarty's own program to foil him. Both of these recreations had a holographic Worf. (TNG: "Ship in a Bottle")
When Deanna Troi took Riker's version of the Bridge Officer's Test in 2370, it contained a recreation of Worf. (TNG: "Thine Own Self")
A transporter accident in 2372 aboard Deep Space 9 resulted in transporter patterns that would normally be stored in the pattern buffer to overwrite some of the characters in the Julian Bashir, Secret Agent 1960s holoprogram. The character of Duchamps was overwritten with the appearance of Worf. (DS9: "Our Man Bashir")
Luther Sloan recreated the entire station and staff of Deep Space 9 in 2374 as part of his investigation into Julian Bashir. This program had a recreation of Worf. (DS9: "Inquisition")

Background information
Significance
Dorn as Worf in Webster
Worf was played by Michael Dorn throughout his time on TNG and DS9, and in all four TNG movies.

Due to his appearances as a regular in eleven seasons (seven in TNG and four in DS9) and four movies, the character Worf holds the record of the most appearances in Star Trek.

Worf also holds the record for the most revivals in Star Trek. He was killed three times in the episodes "Hide and Q", "Transfigurations", and "Ethics", each time recovering. However, Kathryn Janeway has the record for the most "deaths", at nine.

Worf is one of four characters to appear in two series finales ("All Good Things..." and "What You Leave Behind"), the others being Miles O'Brien, William T. Riker and Deanna Troi.

In addition to his film and television appearances, Worf appeared prominently in the game Star Trek: Armada. Michael Dorn also portrayed Worf in the series finale of the television series Webster, titled "Webtrek", in 1989 during the second season of The Next Generation. He shared his scenes on the Enterprise-D bridge with Lorine Mendell, James G. Becker, and Dexter Clay.

Origins and early development
Part of the premise Gene Roddenberry wrote for Star Trek: The Next Generation was that it was set at a time when Klingons had set aside their differences with the Federation, and had become their allies. Robert Justman proposed a "Klingon Marine" serve on the Enterprise as a symbol of this. The character was later made a full Starfleet officer, and was one of the last additions to the permanent cast. (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (2nd ed., p. 16))

Michael Dorn recalled his audition as follows: "I did not wear makeup, but I took on the psychological guise of a Klingon. I walked into Paramount in character. No jokes. No laughing with the other actors. I sat by myself waiting for my interview. When my turn came, I walked in, didn't smile, did the reading, thanked them, and walked right out." (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (2nd ed., p. 20))

According to Robert Justman, Dorn's stage training, as well his lack of a "street accent", were some of the factors which led to Dorn securing the role. (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (2nd ed., p. 20))

Rick Berman recalled that Worf was intended to be merely a recurring character in seven of the first thirteen episodes. Worf's role was expanded after filming and editing of "Encounter at Farpoint" began as the producers felt that the character had presence. (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (2nd ed., p. 20))

Worf's originally planned backstory, in the "TNG Bible", was that he had been on a Klingon ship in one of the last Earth-Klingon battles; and had been rescued by Starfleet, at the age of 8. The episode "Heart of Glory" established the slightly different backstory involving the sneak Romulan attack on Khitomer.

In his online review of "Hide and Q", Wil Wheaton made a comment on Worf's early character and giving Dorn respect for playing Worf as he was back then. Wheaton said he couldn't imagine what it must have been like for Dorn in that first season, describing first season Worf as "one-dimensional and so incredibly stupid." Wheaton also noted that Dorn didn't do much more than Denise Crosby did in those early episodes, and in contrast to Crosby, who quit the show out of frustration, Dorn stayed with it, and over time was allowed to develop Worf into a much more complex and beloved character, eventually becoming a regular on DS9, and also being in all the TNG movies. [3]

Costume and makeup
A sketch of Worf including his new baldric by Durinda Rice Wood
Worf's first-season baldric was fabric. It was a re-use of the prop used in TOS by Kor in "Errand of Mercy" and Kang in "Day of the Dove". (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (2nd ed., p. 20)) During the second season, costume designer Durinda Rice Wood created a new metal one for Worf, made out of bicycle chains she bought in a hardware store. Michael Dorn liked the new design, and agreed to its use. (Departmental Briefing Year Two: Costumes, TNG Season 2 DVD special features)

Worf's ridge patterns evolved due to experimentation by Michael Westmore, mainly for aesthetics, but also to be more comfortable for the actor. While the prosthetics initially took two and a half hours to apply each time, by the end of TNG the process was shortened to about two hours. (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (2nd ed., pp. 21 & 66))

Gene Roddenberry had initially insisted that Worf have a short hairstyle so as to reflect the "no-nonsense" military look of Starfleet. While Westmore accepted this, it grew somewhat longer over the years. In the sixth season of TNG, due to lobbying from Dorn and hairstylist Joy Zapata, Worf debuted a ponytail (beginning from "Face of the Enemy"). Zapata explained, "[Worf's hair] used to remind me of a Klingon that had gone to the beauty salon; it looked like Donna Reed! Now we tie it back, [Dorn] carries himself differently – he's a whole different person". (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (2nd ed., pp. 21 & 234)-235)

The Undiscovered Country
Between the fourth and fifth seasons of The Next Generation, Michael Dorn played Colonel Worf in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. Although the relationship was not stated on screen, the filmmakers' intention was that the Star Trek VI character was the grandfather of the Next Generation character. (Star Trek Encyclopedia (2nd ed., p. 563); [4])

Deep Space Nine
As part of several sweeping changes for Deep Space Nine's fourth season, Worf was added to the regular cast list as the station's strategic operations officer, a position he held until the end. Worf's posting aboard DS9 was commented on in the first draft script of VOY: "Death Wish", in which Q referred to Worf as having been one candidate who Q believed might have been promoted to command the USS Voyager. Q then added, "Oh that's right, they sent him to try to fix that dreary space station, didn't they..."

When asked why he returned to Star Trek, actor Michael Dorn stated, "What interested me was the idea that my character, and I always loved my character, I really was close with him, the idea that my character would grow even more, and that I would become a larger part of the Star Trek universe than I already was, that's what interested me. And I told the producers, and we had many discussions about that that's what attracted me back." (Crew Dossier: Worf, DS9 Season 4 DVD special features)

Ira Behr, Deep Space Nine's executive producer, said that fitting Worf into the show was one of the biggest challenges he had to face during the show's run. However, he felt he had managed this task well. He remarked, "Obviously, one of the reasons Worf was brought on the show was to increase the ratings. After all, they call it show "business". But if we did not feel that Worf would've brought something to the party, we never would've done it. Sometimes business decisions and artistic decisions can ride the same wave." (AOL chat, 1997)

Similarly, as Behr's writing partner Robert Hewitt Wolfe states, "In the beginning it was difficult, I gotta be honest with you, to integrate this new character, but that was good because it challenged us, and made us sort of re-examine the show in a whole new light. How do we make this guy work? How do we bring him in? How does he change the relationships for all of our characters? He stirred up the whole thing again, gave the whole show sort of a second phase, or a second stage rocket. Suddenly, there's Worf and we've got to deal with him and his issues, and suddenly there's Klingons everywhere and that brought a new favor to play with." (Charting New Territory: Deep Space Nine Season Four, DS9 Season 4 DVD special features) 

The decision to have Worf transfer from security to command was Ronald D. Moore's, and was prompted by the fact that the writers didn't simply want to rehash the Next Generation Worf, they wanted to give to the audience a new Worf. As Moore explains, the writers asked themselves, "What is going to make our Worf a little different from the other Worf, and make it worth watching week after week?" Ira Steven Behr further explains, "We had to give the audience a Deep Space Nine Worf. We had to move the character away from where he was before. All the characters on DS9 grow, and we always try to take them farther than where they began." (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion (p. 260))

Ronald D. Moore has also commented, "I've been happy to see the changes in the character since he was brought onto DS9 – I think we ran the danger of "de-fanging" Worf by the end of TNG and there's been a concerted effort made to roughen him up and give him some sharper edges. He's more likely to err now, more likely to do the wrong thing for the wrong reason... I think that makes him more interesting as a character and more compelling to write for." (AOL chat, 1997)

Michael Dorn summates his portrayal of Worf by saying, "Only time will tell, in a way, you know what I mean, what my contribution is. If anything, I'd like to think that I took a character that was not a major character to start with and brought him into the light. It's sort of like one of those things where it's not so much that 'Oh yeah, the star, I have to be the star' and dadada, but the character was not a major character, he was there, but he wasn't a major character. And I was able to bring whatever it is I brought to the character to put him closer to the forefront. I think it kind of bears up because, you know, out of all the people they got to go on Deep Space, who knows? But the character played well on the show, and helped the show over the years. If I had to be remembered for something, that'd be it." (Crew Dossier: Worf, DS9 Season 4 DVD special features)

Apocrypha
Worf in Star Trek: Countdown
Worf's orphaning and subsequent adoption by the Rozhenkos was seen in the The Lost Era novel The Art of the Impossible.

In Peter David's Star Trek: New Frontier and Starfleet Academy novels, Worf's roommate at Starfleet Academy was Zak Kebron, a Brikar who later became a prominent character in the New Frontier novel series.

Worf's somewhat ill-defined role in the initial stages of the series is explained in The Buried Age as being the "chief bridge watch officer" whose duties were to essentially fill in where needed, which allowed him to gain command experience. According to the novel, Worf had put in for security but Picard refused, saying that he needed more experience which would give him more opportunities later on. When Worf says he will do his best to learn all he can, Picard tells him he will be expected to learn all he can.

The novel Triangle: Imzadi II established that shortly after the destruction of the Enterprise-D, Worf proposed to Deanna Troi, and she accepted. However, their engagement was short lived and after a harrowing experience involving the Romulan Sela, Troi realized that she still had feelings for her first love, Commander Riker, while Worf concluded that he was emotionally unsuitable as a long-term partner for Troi. The two broke off their relationship, but remained friends.

In the novel Diplomatic Implausibility, Worf's first assignment as Federation Ambassador brought him to the plant taD (the Klingon word for "frozen") to settle a dispute between the indigenous population, who had appealed for recognition from the Federation after overthrowing the local Klingon government, and the Empire, who wished to have taD back under their own control. With the assistance of his new attaché, Giancarlo Wu, and the crew of the IKS Gorkon, Worf adapted to the needs of his new post and came up with a solution that pleased all parties and avoided bloodshed and installed a Klingon engineer from the Gorkon crew as a ceremonial emperor while also granting practical autonomy to the populace.

The novel A Time for War, A Time for Peace established that Worf decided after various events had occurred, that he was not of the right temperament to be the Federation ambassador and although the new Federation president disagreed, she accepted his resignation. Worf then nominated his son Alexander, to be his replacement as ambassador. Worf decided that after serving the Klingon Empire and the Federation and always doing what was expected of him that the time had come for him to be selfish and he wanted to go back to Starfleet, where he felt the most fulfilled. Admiral Ross immediately reinstated his rank of lieutenant commander and assigned him to be first officer on the Titan under Captain Riker. Worf was filling in at the tactical station during the events of Star Trek Nemesis as the Enterprise's chief of security, Christine Vale, had taken shore leave on Earth and the second in command of security had recently resigned. After the events of Nemesis, in the wake of Data's death, Picard asked Worf to remain aboard the Enterprise and Worf agreed. Novels set after Nemesis, such as Resistance, Before Dishonor, Q&A, and Greater than the Sum, showed Worf serving as acting first officer and then initially refusing the position on a permanent basis. Worf felt that he did not deserve it after what happened back on Soukara and how he abandoned the mission to save Jadzia. After rescuing Picard from the Borg and receiving some sage advice from Dr. Crusher, Worf accepted the position on a permanent basis and was promoted to the rank of commander.

In the PlayStation game Star Trek: Invasion, Worf was put in command of the USS Typhon from early to mid-2376. After the Valkyrie Squadron was put on active duty, Worf left the Typhon.

A picture of Worf can be found in Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force on the USS Voyager inside the quarters of Alexandria Munro should you choose the female character in the game.

The comic book series Star Trek: Countdown, a tie-in to the 2009 Star Trek film, depicted Worf as a general in the Klingon Defense Force in 2387. Worf was critically wounded by Nero while on board the Narada and was last seen unconscious on the Enterprise-E and about to be transported to sickbay.

In Star Trek Online, set thirty years after the events of DS9 and Nemesis, Worf has remained ambassador to Qo'noS and remains one of the few pro-Federation voices in the Empire after the breakdown of the Khitomer Accords. He has become gin'tak to the House of Martok and weds Grilka and they have one son. In describing her to reporter Jake Sisko, he echoes his previous comments on her, saying "She is glorious." He later denounces the Federation when they refuse to help the Klingons fight an Alpha Quadrant infiltration of Species 8472. Players interact with him early on in the Klingon faction story line, and during the special event celebrating the 25th anniversary of Star Trek: The Next Generation from July 19 to 24, 2012 could meet a hologram of Worf as he appeared in 2364. The player also fights alongside him in the cross-faction missions "Sphere of Influence" and "Brushfire", and starting with "Brushfire" Michael Dorn provides voice-overs for all the character's lines. In the mission "Home", part of the "Victory is Life" expansion, Worf becomes Martok's Torchbearer, lighting the Beacon of Kahless in order to fully bring the Empire into the battle against the Hur'q.

In the Star Trek: Picard novel The Last Best Hope, Worf is revealed to have replaced Picard as the captain of the Enterprise-E following Picard's becoming an admiral to aid in the Romulan evacuation in advance of the Romulan sun going supernova. Though there is a token objection due to his reprimand for his actions in prioritizing the life of Jadzia Dax over his mission on Soukara, he is accepted for the role, in part because Starfleet believes it will foster good relations with the Klingon Empire.

Worf of the alternate reality
The alternate reality version of Worf appears in the third issue of the Star Trek: Ongoing story arc The Q Gambit where he is Chancellor of the Klingon colony of Earth after the Empire defeated the Federation and conquered Earth renaming it "Tera'." Worf is introduced to James T. Kirk, who instantly recognizes him and the Starfleet insignia and asks how he got here. Kirk explains that he and his crew were brought over a hundred years into the future by Q and Worf believes that both the crew of the USS Enterprise and the Klingons can be of mutual benefit to one another. Worf then prepares to meet with the advisory council over Sisko's intelligence reports and the events that brought Kirk and his crew to the future while also having rooms prepared for Kirk and his party when he is suddenly killed by his guards and Kurn, but it is revealed that they're actually Changelings who proclaim Earth is now under Dominion control.
