<html><p>By the next year, the romance seemed to have dissolved amicably. Worf transferred to Deep Space 9 and began a romantic relationship with Jadzia Dax, with the two later marrying. Troi and Riker resumed their relationship around the time Worf was grieving Jadzia's death. Worf's only visible unease at their wedding in 2379 was the result of imbibing too much Romulan ale and discomfort at the prospect of appearing naked at their Betazed marriage ceremony. (DS9: "The Way of the Warrior", "Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places", "You Are Cordially Invited"; Star Trek Generations; Star Trek: Insurrection; Star Trek Nemesis)

Alternate realities and timelines
In an alternate timeline briefly created in 2366, Deanna Troi was not serving as a senior officer aboard the Enterprise-D when the ship encountered its predecessor, the Ambassador-class starship USS Enterprise-C. There was no one shown to be serving as ship's counselor in her place, suggesting that the position did not exist due to the constant state of war in that timeline. (TNG: "Yesterday's Enterprise")

In 2369, Q sent Captain Picard into an alternate timeline in which he was a mere lieutenant jg assigned to the Enterprise-D as an assistant astrophysics officer. Although Troi and the other senior officers were less familiar with Picard than they were in his own universe, she and Riker provided advice he sought from them regarding his career prospects. Deanna was eager to leave the meeting, believing that Ten Forward was not the best place to have their discussion, but shortly before leaving the room with Riker, she suggested to Picard that they meet later to resume their conversation. (TNG: "Tapestry")

In 2370, Lieutenant Worf encountered a quantum fissure that caused him to begin shifting between quantum realities. In at least one universe, Troi participated in a surprise celebration for Worf's birthday. Later, Troi spoke with Worf about his son, Alexander, and graciously accepted his offer to serve as his son's soh-chim, formalizing her motherly relationship with Alexander. In two other universes that Worf visited, Troi was married to him in an extremely loving relationship. In the first of those universes, Deanna's romantic affiliation with Worf had begun approximately three years earlier, after he had sought Riker's formal permission to court Troi, in the belief that to do otherwise would be dishonorable. In the latter of the two universes, Troi was the mother to two children that Worf fathered, and he was the Enterprise's first officer. They had a son named Eric-Christopher, who was born in 2367, and a daughter named Shannara, who was born in 2368. However, Troi had no knowledge of Worf's son, Alexander. Although she believed that the Worf who was indigenous to her own universe might not return, Troi kissed Worf goodbye before the Klingon departed her ship in the Curie, a Type 6 shuttlecraft. (TNG: "Parallels")

In an unknown, alternate future timeframe, Troi died from unknown causes, and a funeral was held in her memory. Both Worf and Riker were extremely saddened by her demise, and each blamed the other for preventing a relationship with her, causing relations between the two men to become estranged for the next twenty years. (TNG: "All Good Things...")

Holograms
The holographic Goddess of Empathy
Deanna Troi has been holographically duplicated on a number of occasions.

In 2366, Reginald Barclay, while suffering from holo-addiction, created at least two holographic characters based on Troi in his holodeck fantasy worlds. One referred to itself as the Goddess of Empathy and wore a toga-like garment while displaying aggressively flirtatious and exhibitionist tendencies. (TNG: "Hollow Pursuits")
In 2367, a holographic version of Troi featured in a holographic illusion which Barash trapped Riker in and which was set in the year 2383. This illusory Troi had similarities and differences to the actual Troi, looking older but acting as if she could still sense the feelings of others. Having supposedly accepted a position at Starfleet Command offered to her by "Admiral" Picard, the fictional Troi held a commander's rank and served as Picard's aide, no longer assigned to the Enterprise-D. As the Federation was on the verge of signing a peace treaty with the Romulans, Troi accompanied Admiral Picard aboard the Decius, a Romulan Warbird that also carried Ambassador Tomalak, from Romulan space to the Enterprise. In a conversation with Riker, Troi spoke highly of "Min", a now-deceased woman who had married him and had replaced her as ship's counselor following her departure from the Enterprise. However, after Riker discovered that the woman Troi had referred to was apparently Minuet (a holographic fantasy character he had once created), Troi tried to prevent him from angrily demonstrating the errors of the illusion by encouraging him to become calm. The illusion ended shortly thereafter. (TNG: "Future Imperfect")
In 2369, a hologram of Troi was created by James Moriarty as part of a holographic illusion to trick Captain Picard into releasing his control over the Enterprise-D. (TNG: "Ship in a Bottle")
Miscellaneous information
Lieutenant Commander Troi in Starfleet uniform in 2369
Troi frequently wore casual attire while on duty, possibly due to her position as ship's counselor. (TNG: "The Naked Now", et al.) However, while serving under Edward Jellico in 2369, she was ordered to wear a standard duty uniform, which she began doing at that time. She continued to use the uniform after Captain Picard resumed command. (TNG: "Chain of Command, Part I")

Troi's quarters aboard the Enterprise-D were located at deck 9, room 0910. (TNG: "Clues")

Troi was able to beat Data in a game of three-dimensional chess, using "intuition." When faced with the Kriskov Gambit, instead of countering with the el-Mitra Exchange as is characteristic, Troi chose to leave her king vulnerable, devising a completely unanticipated response to a classic attack, and forcing checkmate in seven moves. (TNG: "Conundrum")

Troi with Riker on a holographic recreation of the Enterprise NX-01 bridge
Among the holographic environments that Troi visited are sickbay and engineering aboard the Intrepid-class starship Voyager, and the bridge, captain's ready room and engineering aboard the NX-class starship Enterprise. (VOY: "Life Line", "Inside Man"; ENT: "These Are the Voyages...")

Despite being half Human and half extraterrestrial by Human standards, Troi was able to participate, without disguise, in away missions that involved traveling to periods of Earth's past before official First Contact took place with the Vulcans. This was because, externally, Betazoids were physically indistinguishable from Humans in every aspect but one: the irises of their eyes were completely black. Humans are known to have irises a very dark brown so as to be nearly black, so this wasn't a telling feature in any case. (TNG: "The Price") (TNG: "Time's Arrow"; Star Trek: First Contact)

Troi did not like riding horses because of their "own mind", as Betazoids become too involved in the thoughts and shifting passions of animals. (TNG: "Pen Pals")

Lwaxana mentioned her daughter while talking to Constable Odo aboard Deep Space 9 in 2369 and remembered her experiences with DaiMon Tog. (DS9: "The Forsaken"; TNG: "Ménage à Troi")

In 2380, Beckett Mariner mentioned Troi to Brad Boimler as a prominent Starfleet officer. (LD: "Second Contact")

Background information
Performers
Deanna Troi was played by actress Marina Sirtis. The baby Deanna Troi in "Dark Page" was played by twins Candace and Nicole Villwock.

Concept origins
The original concept for the character of Deanna Troi was partly inspired by Ilia, a likewise empathic character created for the abandoned series Star Trek: Phase II before ultimately appearing in Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Similarly, Troi's relationship with Riker has its conceptual roots in Ilia's relationship with Willard Decker from Star Trek: The Motion Picture. (Star Trek: The Next Generation - The Continuing Mission, p. 23)

Originally, Deanna Troi was meant to be a very cerebral character. David Gerrold once recalled, "Bob Justman and I spoke about a person aboard ship who serves the function of an emotional healer. Not a chaplain, because we have moved beyond mere ritual, but someone who serves as a 'master.' His/her job is to support those aboard the ship in the job of being the best they can be. That would eventually become Deanna Troi." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 100) Stated Marina Sirtis, "Gene [Roddenberry] had the idea of this character because he felt that in the 24th century mental health should be as important as physical health." (SFX: The A-Z of Star Trek, p. 82) Sirtis also remarked, "Troi was not supposed to be the chick on the show. Gene [Roddenberry] said she was intended to be the brain on the show." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 101) Denise Crosby added, "The original description of Troi was this cool, Icelandic blonde." [2](X)

At one point, Marina Sirtis likened the original concept of Troi to Spock, commenting, "She was supposed to have equal the intelligence of Spock." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 101) Denise Crosby agreed that the original notion of Troi was "almost Spock-like." [3](X) However, the addition of Troi to the mix of TNG's main characters was actually an attempt to differentiate TNG from Star Trek: The Original Series. (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 99) Furthermore, Sirtis was initially eager to dismiss comparisons between Troi and Spock, saying, "Some of Troi's character traits may be similar to his but Troi is not a Spock clone. She is a completely new character." The actress instead speculated that the Troi character was based on Gem, from TOS: "The Empath". "I can only guess that the idea of that kind of character stuck in Gene Roddenberry's mind and that, when he was creating The Next Generation, he decided to use it," Sirtis theorized. (Starlog, issue 126, p. 46)

It was Gene Roddenberry who thought up the name "Deanna Troi". As a personal secret between himself and Susan Sackett, Roddenberry deliberately took the character's first name from Sackett's middle name, and Wesley Crusher's first name from his own middle name. ("Star Trek Redux: Log Entry 35", Inside Trek: My Secret Life with Star Trek Creator Gene Roddenberry)

In early brainstorming, the character of Troi was to have three breasts, but D.C. Fontana objected to this. She later recalled, "I felt women have enough trouble with two. And how are you going to line them up? Vertically, horizontally, or what? I was like, please, don't go there. And they didn't, fortunately." [4](X)

A character description of Deanna Troi was included in the first draft "bible" for Star Trek: The Next Generation (dated 26 November 1986). (Star Trek Creator: The Authorized Biography of Gene Roddenberry, paperback ed., p. 556) In that document, Troi was described as only a quarter Betazoid with some telepathic powers due to her "Starfleet officer grandfather having lived on Betazed with one of its humanoid females." Her past relationship with Riker was described as "intimate." (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (3rd ed., pp. 14-15))

Troi's description in the original TNG casting call (dated 10 December 1986 and reprinted in the Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (3rd ed., p. 13)) was as follows:

"LT. DEANNA TROI – An alien woman who is tall (5'8-6') and slender, about 30 years old and quite beautiful. She serves as the starship's Chief Psychologist, Deanna is probably foreign (anywhere from Italian, Greek, Hungarian, Russian, Icelandic, etc.) with looks and accent to match. She and Number One are romantically involved. Her alien 'look' is still to be determined."
Despite having been described as a quarter Betazoid in the first draft TNG writer's guide, Troi's alien roots were not fully detailed in the casting call. This omission was presumably for the sake of simplicity. (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (3rd ed., p. 15))

In a revision of the series bible (dated 4 February 1987), Troi was no longer referred to as a lieutenant, but as a lieutenant commander. However, she was still described as the Enterprise's chief psychologist. (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (3rd ed., p. 15))

Troi's position in one of the Enterprise-D's three center seats, the other two chairs occupied by Picard and Riker, was originally (i.e., on the eve of the 4 February revisions) to have been filled by Data. This was changed when the producers realized that Troi would be strengthened both in her shipboard role and as a character if she were to occupy the third central seat. Troi was also given the informal duty of notifying Picard of the concerns of his thousand-plus crew, a duty that was initially the official responsibility of Geordi La Forge. (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (3rd ed., pp. 15-16))

In the final draft of the first season writer's guide (dated 23 March 1987, most likely with the script for "Haven" under development), Troi's heritage was altered to how it is established in the series – half Betazoid, with her Starfleet father having lived on Betazed with her native mother. Also, the description of Troi's past romance with Riker was changed from "intimate" to "unconsummated." (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (3rd ed., pp. 14-15))

In her book BFI TV Classics - Star Trek (p. 63), Ina Rae Hark suggested that Troi was created to counteract Picard's dispassion, as Hark supposed his emotional detachment would otherwise be problematic regarding his command decisions. "TNG resolves this dilemma by having Troi serve as a link between Picard's intellectual and scientific advisers and the more passionate field operatives," Hark observed. "She even has a seat on the bridge so that she can read the emotional nuances of potential adversaries for her emotionally tone-deaf captain."

Personification
Deanna Troi was originally to have been played by Denise Crosby, while Marina Sirtis was auditioning for the role of Macha Hernandez, a character later to be named Natasha Yar. (Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages, p. 151) By 13 April 1987, in fact, the only actress who seemed suitable to be cast as Troi was Crosby. [5] However, Crosby herself felt she struggled with the role, later expressing, "What was a Betazoid? It just sounded so gobbledygook and weird." [6](X) On 28 April 1987, a casting tape that included Susan Gibney auditioning for the part was sent from Bonnie Finnegan to TNG Casting Director Junie Lowry.

Although Producers Robert Justman and Rick Berman were happy with the arrangement of Troi being played by Denise Crosby and the security chief being played by Marina Sirtis, Gene Roddenberry decided that each of those two actresses would be better as the other's character, and the roles were consequently reversed, Roddenberry deciding Sirtis' appearance was a better fit for the alien Troi than for the Human security chief. (Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages, p. 151; Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (3rd ed., p. 18)) Said Crosby, "From what I understand from the producers, they were sold on me, as that part [....] Gene felt that – now these are his words – that [...] Troi should be this exotic, otherworldly creature, and I was just this kind of American golden girl." ("Selected Crew Analysis: Casting", TNG Season 1 DVD special features) Furthermore, the producers decided that Sirtis brought a warmth and empathy to her audition that would work very well for the role of Troi. (Star Trek - Where No One Has Gone Before, paperback ed., p. 117) Upon learning she wouldn't be cast as the security chief, though, Sirtis at first suspected she had blown her chances of appearing in the series. (Starlog, issue 126, p. 48) "After my third audition for Tasha, I was literally walking out the door when they called me back to read for Deanna," Sirtis noted. (Trek: The Next Generation, 2nd ed., p. 27) The producers asked her to audition for the Troi role, thrust some script pages at Sirtis, and gave her an hour to learn three scenes. (Starlog, issue 126, p. 48) "While I was looking at the script," she continued, "Director Corey Allen came in and said, 'You have something personally that the character should have... an empathy, so use it.'" (Trek: The Next Generation, 2nd ed., p. 27) Looking back, Sirtis found that piece of advice "funny," as she didn't personally believe she herself was much like the character, having a more hot-headed temperament than Troi. At the time, though, she was encouraged by Allen's comments. Sirtis closed herself off in a room for the hour she had been given to prepare, during which the actress bore in mind that she typically never managed to audition while holding a piece of paper in her hands. "So, in that hour, I was determined to just memorize the scenes and tough it out," she remembered. "But my knees were knocking all the while and I was scared to death. I thought, 'OK, don't panic. Just learn it, put down the papers and see what develops.'" (Starlog, issue 126, pp. 46, 48 & 58)

Marina Sirtis was grateful that the part she was now trying out for had been changed to Troi. She clarified, "Basically, I just wanted the job! But I have to be honest; it suited me better when they swapped us over [...] because the scenes were so much more emotional and I could really let go. The way I was playing it was like Greek tragedy – I'm not saying that was the right way to go, but I like that kind of stuff, because I can get my teeth into it." (Star Trek: The Magazine Volume 2, Issue 12, p. 19)

Marina Sirtis was cast as Troi on 6 May 1987. ("Selected Crew Analysis: Casting", TNG Season 1 DVD special features) That day, she received the call informing her she had won the role, though she had been in the midst of packing to return to England that afternoon, as her visa had expired. The news consequently startled her. "I was ready to go when the phone rang and I was told I got the job. So I unpacked! I was so excited you would have had to scrape me off the ceiling!" Sirtis exclaimed. (Star Trek - Where No One Has Gone Before, paperback ed., pp. 117-118)

Troi's accent was devised by Marina Sirtis, who was actually born to Greek parents in North London. "I didn't want anyone to pin down my accent to any particular country," she revealed, "and being good at accents, the producers trusted me to come up with something appropriate." (Trek: The Next Generation, 2nd ed., p. 27) She explained further, "It was an Eastern European accent, which kind of started with the Tasha Yar auditions, 'cause she was supposed to be from Eastern Europe. Then, when they told me to make an accent up, from Betazed, I kind of just modified that Eastern Europe accent a bit. I based it on a friend of mine, who's actually Isreali." ("Selected Crew Analysis: Casting", TNG Season 1 DVD special features)

Designing Troi's look
An unused look considered for Troi included a "skant" version of the Starfleet uniform and a severe bun hairstyle, as well as another hairstyle that was curly and high. (TNG Season 1 Blu-ray, "Stardate Revisited" special feature)

Introduction
Marina Sirtis with Bandi-playing performers from "Encounter at Farpoint"
Owing to the complexity of Troi's character, the TNG producers were somewhat uncertain about how to handle the part right up to the filming of series pilot "Encounter at Farpoint". (Starlog, issue 126, p. 46) Though Troi's rank of lieutenant commander wasn't established in that episode, Picard refers to Troi as "commander" in the very first scene. During an away mission in "Encounter at Farpoint", however, Riker mistakenly refers to her as "lieutenant", carried over from an earlier version of the script. (citation needed • edit) Also, with the advent of "Encounter at Farpoint", Troi became the first counselor to appear in a Star Trek series.

Coming from a theater background with very little knowledge of how to act in television productions, Marina Sirtis felt unsure about how to play Troi in "Encounter at Farpoint". "I didn't understand what I was doing; I had the impression that Troi was an open sore of emotions, but I wasn't aware that you didn't have to show emotion to get the message across," she conceded. (Star Trek: The Magazine Volume 2, Issue 12, p. 19) Sirtis' performance in "Encounter at Farpoint" wasn't influenced, whatsoever, by watching the footage of herself as she played the part; she and her castmates weren't allowed to see any dailies of their work on the episode until three days before it was to have its first public airing. At lunchtime three days prior to the cast screening, Sirtis commented, "The prospect of seeing myself in this show for the very first time is terrifying." (Starlog, issue 126, p. 46) Although she attended the screening, the actress wasn't proud of her performance in the episode. On the contrary, she later admitted, "I hated myself in the pilot." (Star Trek: The Magazine Volume 2, Issue 12, p. 19)

The TNG producers' uncertainty about how to handle the depiction of Troi continued after the filming of "Encounter at Farpoint". (Starlog, issue 126, p. 46) Consequently, several differences exist between the pilot episode's depiction of Troi and her appearance in the subsequent series. "People watching the pilot and then the rest of the series will think they've cast two different people in the role," reckoned Marina Sirtis. "My character changed quite a bit between the pilot and the series. Particularly in looks." (Starlog, issue 126, p. 46)

The changes to Troi between the pilot and the series include the fact that she communicates telepathically with Riker in the pilot, but does not do so in the series, a lessening of her abilities that essentially avoided the emotional soliloquies that made actress Marina Sirtis cringe in "Encounter at Farpoint". (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (2nd ed., p. 27)) She explained, "The producers decided that it would be too limiting to the character to just go around feeling things all the time. So, they changed the level of Troi's powers." (Starlog, issue 126, p. 46)

Other differences were changes in Troi's hair and clothing. Her trademark hairstyles were usually achieved with a combination of Marina Sirtis' own hair and hairpieces. The only time her own hair was used without any hairpieces was in "Encounter at Farpoint". [7] Also, Troi wears a virtually unique "skant" Starfleet uniform in that episode, but is mostly adorned in more informal attire in the series. In the pilot, she wears her curly hair down and held back by a headband, but she appears with a severe bun hairstyle throughout the first season (echoing the earlier hairstyle tried out during preproduction). Accounting for the modifications, Marina Sirtis stated, "After the pilot was shot, the producers decided that the look didn't suit the character the way she was originally envisioned. They wanted something a bit more elegant and contained." (Starlog, issue 126, p. 46) The factors that inspired these stylistic changes were, in Sirtis' own words, that Troi was "cerebral and kind of elegant." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 101) Yet another reason her look needed to be changed was that the actress, on the other hand, was too overweight. (Cinefantastique, Vol. 23, No. 2/3, p. 76) "If you go back to 'Encounter at Farpoint', where I was dressed in the cosmic cheerleader outfit with the ugliest go-go boots ever designed, I was about twenty pounds heavier. Imagine a potato with matchsticks sticking out of it, and that was my shape." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 101) "Encounter at Farpoint" is the only time Troi wears a uniform with rank insignia for the first half of the TNG series.

Serialization
As the first season got underway, Marina Sirtis noticed that Troi, now clad in a variety of low-cut casual duty outfits, had become less of an intellect than the actress had first been led to believe the character would be. "Unfortunately, [...] when I [...] got cleavage, she lost her brain matter," Sirtis lamented. "That was a shame [....] I lost weight over the years, and [...] how much cleavage I showed depended on which [costume] I wore, since they were all cut differently and some were lower than others." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, pp. 101 & 102) Through the rest of the first season, Sirtis' own hair was taken up, and the high bun was a hairpiece, added to give extra height for a demure look. [8]

Although Picard refers to Troi as "commander", as is the customary verbal address for a lieutenant commander in informal situations, in the very first scene of "Encounter at Farpoint", she is not referred to as holding that rank in any other episode of the first season. Her rank as lieutenant commander was ultimately first established by a bridge monitor that appears in the third Season 1 installment, "Code of Honor".

Not only did Marina Sirtis feel that the change from the constantly emotional Troi in "Encounter at Farpoint" freed the character "to have more substance and scope", but the actress also liked how Troi continued to be developed as the first season went on. While the filming of "Justice" – the eighth Season 1 outing – neared completion, the actress related, "This show's writers have given me a great deal to do. I'm not just there when they need an empath. That would have gotten boring real fast. So far, I'm very pleased with the things they've given me to do." In particular, Sirtis was of the opinion that the fact Troi's advice was taken extremely seriously by Captain Picard contributed to an overall strong role of women in the then-new series. On the other hand, although there was discussion about Troi having to take command in a (never-produced) first season episode, Sirtis vetoed that idea, stipulating, "I'm the mental person. Deanna would be dangerous with that kind of power." Meanwhile, one difficulty Sirtis found in playing Troi was performing the scenes featuring the Enterprise shaking. "I've been pretty uncomfortable doing those scenes so far. I'm hoping it doesn't show," she laughed. (Starlog, issue 126, pp. 46, 48 & 58)

As the first season progressed, the writers struggled with Troi's character, believing her to be one of the hardest to write for. Marina Sirtis admitted, "I always felt that Deanna posed a big problem for the writers, that they never quite knew how to use her that effectively on the show." Star Trek Monthly issue 27, p. 18) In fact, according to Sirtis, Troi was almost dropped from the series, as a result. "Because they gave her these empathic powers and she wasn't just a normal psychologist," the actress explained, "they went, 'Oh blimey, well if she can sense feelings and figure out what's going on, maybe she shouldn't be in this scene.' 'Okay, write her out.' That happened a lot, because in the first season I didn't have an office, I was just around. I remember one of the directors came up to me and said, 'You only have a couple of lines in this episode, so I told them to give you the week off and write you out.' I was like, 'Thanks very much, but that's residuals I won't be getting!' At one point I really did feel that they were thinking about losing me. I've got this from Majel [Barrett, Roddenberry's wife]. He came home one day and said, 'I think we've got one too many girls on the show,' and it didn't need a rocket scientist to work out that you need a doctor and a security chief but you don't really need a psychologist. So I had a very stressful first season, because I didn't know if I was going to have a job at the end of it." (SFX: The A-Z of Star Trek, p. 82)

When Denise Crosby and Beverly Crusher actress Gates McFadden left the series at the end of its first season, the decision was made to retain Marina Sirtis as Troi for the second season. "It was very ironic, because I was the one whose job was in danger," she commented. "Come the second season, I'm the only one left of the girls. The weight lifted off my shoulders at Jonathan Frakes' wedding, in the hiatus. Gene took me aside and said, 'The first episode of the new season is going to be a Troi episode,' and I literally just burst into tears. It was all uphill from there." Even though Dr. Pulaski was introduced at the start of the second season, Sirtis felt that plenty room was still made for the role of Troi in that season, given that Pulaski actress Diana Muldaur was from a different generation. "So I got to do all the young woman stuff," Sirtis noted. (SFX: The A-Z of Star Trek, p. 82)

Troi's rank as lieutenant commander was reestablished in Season 2, appearing on the observation room viewscreen when Dr. Pulaski demonstrates an image of Troi's unborn fetus in second season opener "The Child".

From that point on, Troi wore her hair long, in loose ringlets, and it was taken off her face, held in place by a headband. Again, this look was achieved by a combination of Marina Sirtis' own long, curly hair and hairpieces, which added extra volume and length. The hairpieces could also be styled before they were added to Sirtis' own hair, which cut down on preparation time. As the series proceeded, there were subsequent slight changes to Troi's hair. [9]

Marina Sirtis was delighted with the televised narratives concocted for Troi. "When they saw that I had range, I got great storylines – three or four good ones every year," she enthused. "I think it was [La Forge actor] LeVar [Burton] who said, 'Troi is the soul and the conscience on the Enterprise.' Consequently I got all the emotional stuff to do, which is my dream – that's what I love to do." (SFX: The A-Z of Star Trek, p. 82) Sirtis felt that Troi particularly started to become more developed in TNG Season 3. "Things definitely got better starting in the third season," the actress declared. "She became less decorative and more interesting." (Star Trek Monthly issue 27, p. 18) Sirtis never felt secure in playing Troi until around the third or fourth season, by which time the character had become firmly established as a professional psychologist, so Troi's absences from the bridge could be accounted for by presuming she was meanwhile working in her office. (Star Trek: Communicator issue 115, p. 73)

Troi didn't appear in all the third season installments she potentially could have. In the first draft of Season 3 outing "The Enemy", Troi was stranded on an alien planet along with Geordi La Forge. When they encountered a Romulan officer on the planet's surface, Troi incapacitated him. "I felt very excited about this," Sirtis related. "I finally got to do something interesting and different and, of course, when the final script came not only was I not on the planet, but I had one line at the end of the show – and that was actually cut." (Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages, p. 202)

To portray a supposed nude scene in "Ménage à Troi", Marina Sirtis and Majel Barrett wore skimpy underwear, contrary to claims later made by Barrett, who alleged that both she herself and Sirtis had been fully naked. (Star Trek: Communicator issue 113, p. 19)

As each day's production on TNG often continued into the early hours of the next day, Marina Sirtis was cautious about the filming of Troi's scenes. "I often wanted another take – but I didn't necessarily ask for one because the crew was always itching to get home," she explained. (Star Trek: Communicator issue 102, p. 53)

By the end of the third season, Troi was the TNG main character that received the least attention from the series' writers. "The trouble with Troi is that because she's an empath you think she walks into a room and says, 'I feel pain.' That's a cliche," Michael Piller pointed out. As a result, the writers were continuing to find that writing for her was challenging. "It is difficult," admitted Ronald D. Moore, "because you run into a double trap of how much does she know and when. Especially when dealing with powerful aliens. It's unfortunate because the things she's had, she's been wonderful in." (Cinefantastique, Vol. 21, No. 2, p. 51)

At the start of the fourth season, developing Troi more was a goal that Jeri Taylor very much wanted to achieve. This was because Taylor thought Troi had been underused and therefore wanted to make her a more rounded and interesting character. At that point in the series, Marina Sirtis unhappily concurred with the opinion that Troi had been underutilized, citing her exclusion from "The Enemy" as an example. Michael Piller accepted that further developing Troi, together with the other main characters, was on the writing staffers' minds from the start of the season. However, he also argued, "I think the last two years have seen her develop a great deal and that does not mean it's sufficient or there shouldn't be more done, but I believe that she used to be a character who looked at the screen and said 'I sense anger out there' and we've given her a chance to actually do therapy, to do some very serious stories and make some critical contributions to the solutions or problems and really become a counselor in the best sense of the word. I don't really think that she's an underdeveloped character anymore. I feel very good about Troi. She's a really sexy lady who provides an enormous amount of emotional support to our other continuing characters." (Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages, pp. 201 & 202)

In a scene from the first draft script of fourth season outing "Suddenly Human", Troi stated, "I am half-Betazoid, half Human... Yes, and all woman." Immediately thereafter, Jono touched her breasts and Troi explained to him, "They're breasts. Infants nurse on them." ("Difficult Days: Log Entry 48", Inside Trek: My Secret Life with Star Trek Creator Gene Roddenberry)

It wasn't until fifth season installments "Disaster" and "Conundrum" that Troi's lieutenant commander rank was mentioned again, following the visual reference to it in "The Child". Also in "Conundrum", Deanna's birthday is shown on-screen as being March 29th, which happens to be Marina Sirtis' real birth date.

After Susan Sackett discovered she had been excommunicated by the TNG cast and crew at Gene Roddenberry's funeral (held on 1 November 1991), she felt as though the character of Troi was essentially being channeled through Marina Sirtis. "She seemed a lot like her character at that moment when I ran into her on my last day on the Paramount lot," Sackett reckoned. "Perhaps she was becoming an empath like Deanna Troi." ("All Good Things: Log Entry 59", Inside Trek: My Secret Life with Star Trek Creator Gene Roddenberry)

The make-up Sirtis wore as Troi's Romulan disguise is tweaked
The slight changes to Troi's hairstyle stopped at the start of Season 6, when it was altered more significantly. This time, much of Marina Sirtis' own hair was styled more loosely around her face, with the ringlet curls hairpiece secured in a low ponytail. This style was seen for the first time in "Relics". As the season progressed, this style was changed in favor of another style which saw Troi's hair taken back off her face, but still styled in lower ringlets and without any headband. [10]

Troi meeting Scotty in a deleted scene
In an ultimately deleted scene from "Relics", Troi met Montgomery Scott. Owing to the scene deletion, it is not explained why, at the end of the episode, Troi gives Scott a kiss goodbye, as they never actually meet during the final edit of the episode until that moment.

In "A Fistful of Datas", Marina Sirtis had fun playing Troi in a Wild West holographic program. She especially enjoyed dressing up, and it allowed her the first opportunity to portray the character with a hint of comedy. (Star Trek: Communicator issue 113, p. 19)

In sixth season outing "Chain of Command, Part I", Troi finally appeared in a Starfleet uniform. Not since "Encounter at Farpoint" had she been shown wearing a uniform with rank insignia (although a fictional depiction of a uniformed Troi appears in "Future Imperfect"). She also ceased wearing hair decorations.

Marina Sirtis was wowed by how, in penultimate Season 6 offering "Timescape", Troi manages to instruct Data and Geordi La Forge on Romulan engine functions. In response, the actress quipped, "Amazing how, when her cleavage disappears, Troi can do other things!" (Star Trek: Communicator issue 113, p. 19)

For Season 7, Troi's hair was given another new look, with long, but softer, copper-colored waves, first seen in "Interface". Again, this was achieved by a combination of Marina Sirtis' long, straightened, copper-highlighted hair and a hairpiece to add volume. Troi's hairstyle also varied in Season 7 depending on whether she was on duty or not. When off duty, her hair was looser, and she wore it with bangs. [11]

Marina Sirtis didn't enjoy performing Troi's transformation into an amphibian in seventh season outing "Genesis". Her dislike of the experience was because she hated prosthetics and water, yet the part required her to be exposed to both. (Star Trek: Communicator issue 113, p. 19)

Several former TNG writing staffers have expressed criticisms about Troi. "A therapist on a ship full of characters that supposedly had gone beyond Human foibles and no longer succumbed to petty jealousy and anger? Why is there a therapist on board?" stated Brannon Braga. Naren Shankar agreed, "I couldn't understand it, especially coming from an immigrant family where nobody talks about their problems, ever. The notion of having an onboard psychiatrist was so weird. I was, like, 'What does she do all day? I don't understand.' She could look at the guy on the viewscreen who's angry and go, 'I think he's angry. He seems angry to me, Captain.'" Tracy Tormé admitted, "I'm not really sure that the Deanna Troi character ever fully worked for me. I liked Marina very much as a person, but that character was a little [too] soft for me and touchy-feely." Unfortunately for Sirtis, she felt likewise. (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, pp. 100-101) Although she spoke approvingly about Troi being "so deep with that kind of insight into people," Sirtis also bemoaned the fact that it wasn't made clear on-screen that Troi was intended to be the most intellectual of the main characters. (Trek: The Next Generation, 2nd ed., p. 27; The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 101) "There wasn't enough range in Troi," the actress complained. "All she seemed to be feeling was a lot of anguish." Hence, the TNG writing staffers tried to improve their writing of Troi for Sirtis' benefit. "Poor Marina," said Shankar, "we really tried to help her in the last few years of that show." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 101) Sirtis appreciated their efforts, remarking shortly after the series ended, "Within the last one and a half seasons, I've become much happier with my character's development." (Star Trek: Communicator issue 102, p. 54)

Of all the TNG main characters, Deanna Troi had the most number of changes to the look of her character throughout the series, in both costume and hairstyles. Those incremental stylistic changes were important to how Marina Sirtis portrayed Troi. Moreover, the actress, in retrospect, pointed out that the advances in the portrayal of Troi coincided with how women, in general, were characterized in Star Trek. (Star Trek Monthly issue 27, p. 17) Sirtis noted that both Troi and Beverly Crusher were simultaneously in "positions of power" and "were in the caring profession, so we couldn't be too aggressive." (Star Trek Monthly issue 27, p. 18) Despite Troi often doing the same kinds of things, the actress felt she was fortunate to play a character whom she regarded as essentially the "soul" or "conscience" of the Next Generation crew. (Star Trek: Communicator issue 115, p. 73) "To me, Troi was the nicest person aboard the Enterprise," Sirtis proclaimed, "because, instead of being wacky and zany, she was always understanding and sympathetic towards people." (Star Trek: Communicator issue 102, p. 55) Sirtis also considered herself lucky that Troi was possessed and transformed by so many different entities in the course of the series. (Star Trek: Communicator issue 113, p. 19)

Marina Sirtis did have one regret about Troi, at the end of the series. "If I could really travel back through time and relive the TV series, I wouldn't give Deanna a foreign accent – even though her mother is a Betazoid," she conceded. Sirtis believed her foreign accent had been made a mockery of by the fact that Majel Barrett-Roddenberry had played Lwaxana Troi with a distinctly American accent. "But over the years, Deanna lost the [foreign] accent and sounded much more mid-Atlantic," Sirtis observed. (Star Trek: Communicator issue 102, p. 55)

Reappearances
For Star Trek Generations, Troi's hairstyle more resembled her off-duty look from Season 7, but this time the hairstyle was worn with her on-duty uniform. The hairpiece used was much longer, however, in much smoother waves than the style seen in Season 7. [12]

The depiction of Troi in Star Trek Generations extremely appealed to Marina Sirtis. "Steering the Enterprise was among the many things which I loved about Star Trek Generations," she reminisced. "It's something which Deanna had never done on the television show [....] [In the film,] I wanted to press the right buttons at the right time, so I sought advice from Brent Spiner (as Data, Spiner had often piloted the Enterprise on the TV series), who said, 'Marina, you're not playing the piano. You don't have to press a million buttons." (Star Trek: Communicator issue 102, p. 53)

For Star Trek Generations, Marina Sirtis played Troi for about three weeks of the film's shoot, whereas filming the movie took fifty days. "Because Generations was obviously shot over a longer time period [than the TV series], I asked for that extra take if necessary," she clarified. By the time of the film, Troi's accent had changed so much from sounding foreign that Sirtis noted, "She tried very hard to sound completely American during Generations." (Star Trek: Communicator issue 102, pp. 53 & 55)

From Star Trek: First Contact onwards, Marina Sirtis wore full wigs as Troi. The reason, again, was largely a production one. In Star Trek: First Contact, two wigs were used, one which resembled the Generations look but had caramel highlights, and a much flatter, long layered wig seen when Troi was on Earth. [13]

Acknowledging Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner as the stars of the TNG films, Marina Sirtis had no aspirations for Troi to appear in a central role in any future Star Trek film, despite the character having centrally featured in the occasional TNG episode. Shortly after her work on Star Trek: First Contact, Sirtis mused, "We could make 10 ST:TNG movies, and I really don't feel that any of them would be about my character. I'll always be a supporting actress in Star Trek. And, that's actually fine with me if they continue to do what they've done on the last two films, which is to find me something new and different to do. If they continue like that, I'd be perfectly happy. Also, I wouldn't have the responsibility of carrying a whole movie, like Patrick does. No one will blame me if a ST:TNG movie ever doesn't make any money!" However, neither did Sirtis expect, at the time of that interview, to appear in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine or Star Trek: Voyager any time soon, though she later ended up making three appearances in the latter series. (Star Trek Monthly issue 27, pp. 19 & 20)

In Star Trek: Insurrection, a new long wig was used to give Troi a smooth, caramel-highlighted hairstyle. This wig was also used for her appearances in Star Trek: Voyager. [14]

In Star Trek Nemesis, another long wig was used, with highlights and layers. Sirtis has commented that, at the time the movies were made, her own hair was very similar to the wigs she wore but that production reasons meant she wore full wigs. [15]

Marina Sirtis believed that, over time, she was becalmed by portraying Troi. "The job was almost 15 years: seven years on the series, then four films," she pointed out. "During that time I was being Deanna more hours in the day than I was being Marina, and it did kinda rub off on me." (SFX: The A-Z of Star Trek, p. 83)

Ultimately, Troi became the most prominent example of a counselor in the Star Trek franchise. She also set a precedent that wasn't followed until Ezri Dax became the second counselor to appear in a Star Trek series, in DS9 Season 7.

Troi is one of four characters to appear in two series finales (TNG: "All Good Things..." and ENT: "These Are the Voyages..."), the others being William T. Riker, Worf, and Miles O'Brien.

Reception and aftermath
Attending multiple conventions and discovering that Troi was very popular with fans who went to such events inspired Marina Sirtis into becoming more secure in her job of portraying the character, in about the third or fourth season of TNG. (Star Trek: Communicator issue 115, p. 73) Some of the fans, though, wanted Troi to be more akin to the actress who played her. "Because the people who attend conventions are fans of Troi, I receive some positive feedback, but sometimes fans say, 'Why can't Troi be more like Marina? Marina's so much fun, but Troi is a little dull sometimes,'" relayed Sirtis. (Star Trek: Communicator issue 102, p. 55)

Due to the low-cut costumes Marina Sirtis wore in the early days of the series, Troi became the sex symbol of Star Trek: The Next Generation. (Star Trek: Communicator issue 102, p. 54) An aspect of Troi's character that, in the first three seasons of the show, fascinated fans was the hint of a romance between her and Riker. (Cinefantastique, Vol. 21, No. 2, p. 51) According to Michael Dorn, the idea of Troi having a romance with Worf, when he lobbied for it at conventions, was popular too. As it turned out, though, Jeri Taylor stated about Troi's Season 7 relationship with Worf, "I've probably gotten more antagonistic mail on this than anything." (Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages, p. 284)

A wig believed to have been worn by Marina Sirtis or one of her doubles in the latter films was sold on the It's A Wrap! sale and auction on eBay. [16]

Apocrypha
In the novel Triangle: Imzadi II, set in mid-2371, Worf makes a marriage proposal to Troi and she accepts. However, after Riker and Commander Elizabeth Shelby rescue Troi and Worf's son, Alexander, from a hostage situation, Troi and Worf realize that they are too different to be married and that Troi still has feelings for Riker. The couple call off their engagement as a result.

In the novel The Battle of Betazed, Troi is involved in a successful attempt to liberate Betazed from the Dominion, following the events of "In the Pale Moonlight".
