<html><p>In the aborted timeline in which Voyager avoided the nebula that contained the transwarp hub controlled by the Borg, the ship returned to the Alpha Quadrant sixteen years later than they did in the prime timeline. Janeway became a vice admiral and traveled back in time to 2378, bringing along technology approximately thirty years from the future to help Voyager return to Earth using the previously avoided hub. The Janeway from this timeline had become more obsessed with bringing her crew home after having suffered heavy casualties during the remaining sixteen years since they had encountered the Borg-infested nebula. She had also encountered the Borg several more times, which had enabled her to develop new tactics and weapons, including ablative generator armor and a type of transphasic torpedo. She had apparently also studied the Borg extensively; she knew the shields protecting the hub were controlled by the Borg Queen herself. She also gave up coffee, in favor of tea, but only took up coffee again after she went back in time to help her younger self get home. This Janeway had become very bitter and lost her idealism, but upon seeing the crew's loyalty, she regained her idealism and agreed to work with the crew to deliver a crippling blow to the Borg and get home. Pretending to be seeking the Borg Queen's help in getting Voyager home because of the stubbornness of her present-day counterpart, this Janeway allowed herself to be captured and assimilated by the Borg Queen, infecting her with a neurolytic pathogen, killing her and destroying the Borg Unicomplex. She died in the explosion, but her sacrifice allowed Voyager to finally return home while destroying the Borg transwarp hub. (VOY: "Endgame")

Background information
Kathryn Janeway was played by actress Kate Mulgrew. In many long and reverse shots, Sue Henley played Janeway, functioning as Mulgrew's stand-in and body double. The young Janeway in "Flashback" was played by an unknown actress, while photo double Erin Price stood in for Mulgrew in the last episode, "Endgame". In the episode "Vis à Vis", Janeway was briefly portrayed by Robert Duncan McNeill after exchanging DNA with Tom Paris, whose DNA had been previously taken by the impostor Steth.

The decision to feature a female captain as the lead character of the (not-yet-named) series of Star Trek: Voyager helped set that then-forthcoming Star Trek show apart from its predecessors. (Braving the Unknown: Season One, VOY Season 1 DVD special feature) Executive Producer Rick Berman explained, "The feeling was that... the best direction for us to go – in terms of trying new things, being socially responsible, which Star Trek has always been – was to go for a female captain." (The First Captain: Bujold, VOY Season 1 DVD special feature) Berman elaborated, "We didn't want to just create a captain and cast it with a female. We wanted to create a female captain who was a captain that was somewhat more nurturing and a little bit less swashbuckling than someone like Captain Kirk, a little bit less sullen than someone like Captain Sisko, and a little bit more approachable than Captain Picard." (Star Trek: Voyager Companion (p. ?)) Wanting to develop the character of a female captain who would act as the lead role on Star Trek: Voyager was one motive Berman had for including Jeri Taylor as another executive producer involved in the conceptual genesis of the series, as it was believed Taylor could be a positive influence on the character's development. (Star Trek: Voyager - A Vision of the Future, p. 156) Taylor and her then-associates, Berman and Executive Producer Michael Piller, all agreed that they wanted a female captain for the series. (Star Trek: Voyager - A Vision of the Future, p. 158)

Although a female captain had been decided on, this concept was downplayed to Paramount Studios. Essentially, the three executive producers of the forthcoming series said to Paramount, "Let us interview both sexes, and if the best actor we find is a woman, can we hire her?" Eventually, Paramount accepted this proposal. The studio's hesitation was based on uncertainty over the viewing audience's possible response to having a female captain as the series lead. No one at the studio knew if the viewers – who were well known as predominantly male, aged twenty-five to forty-five – would accept the idea. However, the choice of a female captain had a significant advantage, as it would eliminate the problem of fans comparing the new captain to Captains Kirk and Picard. As a result, the executive producers proceeded unhindered, building the notion of a female captain into their premise for the series. (Star Trek: Voyager - A Vision of the Future, pp. 158-159)

In a series of early development notes written by Jeri Taylor (dated 3 August 1993), the character of the captain was briefly outlined, in a section titled "The Crew". The outline stated, "Captain – a human female, Lindsay Wagner type." (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 176)

The character was originally named "Elizabeth Janeway". ([2](X); VOY Season 2 DVD trivia text version of "The 37's") In the first draft script of "Caretaker" (dated 8 June 1994), the character had that name, though she had received the first name "Kathryn" by the time the final draft of the script was issued.

In the "Caretaker" script, Janeway was described as "a charismatic woman in her early forties." The script went on to say, "She has a warm thoughtful face and remarkably attentive eyes that suggest a deep awareness of all that is going on around her."

Looking for the right actress to play Janeway was an arduous process, due to the untried nature of the female character. Jeri Taylor commented, "The search for the captain was a long and difficult one. This is the person that gets the white-hot glare of publicity as the first female ever to head one of the Star Trek series and she had to be just right." (Captains' Logs Supplemental - The Unauthorized Guide to the New Trek Voyages)

Kate Mulgrew's original audition
Numerous actresses have claimed that they were or have been reported in the media as having been considered for the role of Janeway, most notably Susan Gibney (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion (p. 299); A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 267; Star Trek - Where No One Has Gone Before, paperback ed., p. 214), and veteran science fiction television actress Erin Gray. Others considered include Karen Austin (citation needed • edit), Joanna Cassidy (Star Trek - Where No One Has Gone Before, paperback ed., p. 214), Lindsay Crouse (citation needed • edit), Blythe Danner (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 267), Patty Duke (citation needed • edit), Chelsea Field (Star Trek - Where No One Has Gone Before, paperback ed., p. 214), Linda Hamilton (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 267; Star Trek - Where No One Has Gone Before, paperback ed., p. 214), Kate Jackson (Star Trek - Where No One Has Gone Before, paperback ed., p. 214), Patsy Kensit (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 267; Star Trek - Where No One Has Gone Before, paperback ed., p. 214), Carolyn McCormick (citation needed • edit), Tracy Scoggins (citation needed • edit), Helen Shaver (citation needed • edit), and Lindsay Wagner (Star Trek - Where No One Has Gone Before, paperback ed., p. 214). At an early time of pre-production when it was unclear that Janeway was to be a woman, actors Gary Graham and Rene Rivera also auditioned for the role. (citation needed • edit) Nigel Havers was another male actor who was considered for the part. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 267)

Geneviève Bujold as Nicole Janeway


Eventually, French-Canadian actress Geneviève Bujold was cast in the role of Elizabeth Janeway. Following this selection, the character was described in an early press release (dated 2 September 1994), which referred to Janeway as "a Human female [who] leads the combined teams of Starfleet and Maquis personnel. She is not the only female Captain in Starfleet, however, her intelligence, thoughtfulness, dedication and diplomacy have earned her respect and recognition as one of the best Starfleet Captains – male or female." [3] Due to legal aspects (specifically, that a prominent person, an actual American feminist writer, named "Elizabeth Janeway" existed), the name had to be changed. At Bujold's request, the character was renamed "Nicole Janeway".

Kate Mulgrew with an unused haircut she originally wore as Janeway
Genevieve Bujold left the cast of Star Trek: Voyager during filming of the pilot, "Caretaker". The first season DVD release includes the first public release of footage featuring Bujold as Janeway. The extant footage shows a subdued Bujold; accustomed to the big screen, her quiet, nuanced acting style did not blend well with the rest of the cast. A distinctly unimpressed Brannon Braga commented, "If you watch her dailies, you can see she's not very good." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 569) When Bujold left the set after two days of filming, Kate Mulgrew, who had been Braga's second choice, was asked to come back for another audition. Mulgrew ended up being cast in the part, replacing Bujold. At that time, the character's name was changed to its final form – "Kathryn Janeway".

Jeri Taylor was hopeful that, with Kate Mulgrew in the role, Captain Janeway could and would be highly sociable. Shortly after casting the part, Taylor remarked, "We are going to see that she interacts much more easily on a social level with the crew in a way that Picard never did." (Captains' Logs Supplemental - The Unauthorized Guide to the New Trek Voyages)

In an early press release issued shortly after the casting of Kate Mulgrew, much the same information about Janeway was presented as in the earlier press release, apart from a few changes. For example, the character (now renamed "Kathryn") was introduced as "a Human Starfleet Captain" rather than "a Human female". The updated press release additionally referred to Janeway by remarking, "She is a tough Captain, who is not afraid to take chances." The same document relayed that Mulgrew had commented, "Captain Kathryn Janeway is the quintessential woman of the future... both commanding and discerning in her warmth; she's authoritative while remaining accessible. Beneath her extraordinary control runs a very deep vein of vulnerability and sensitivity that I look forward to exploring in seasons to come." [4]

Due to the female gender of Voyager's captain, depicting the character was a balancing act; the captain's feminine qualities, her nurturing and emotional aspects, had to be maintained while also making the character tough enough that she was believable as a Starfleet captain. Concerning the plausibility of the character's toughness, Rick Berman stated, "It's not really all that true with a somewhat diminutive woman like Kate Mulgrew. Those are problems that we find enjoyable to work with and to overcome." (Star Trek: Voyager - A Vision of the Future, p. 159) Berman was ultimately pleased with how Mulgrew sought this balance. He recalled, "Kate, I think, remarkably deliver[ed] a feminine nurturing side and at the same time, a sense of strength and confidence. And that's just what we were looking for and I think that we've gotten it in spades." (Star Trek: Voyager Companion (p. ?))

The Star Trek: Voyager costuming department regarded the maintenance of Kate Mulgrew's body weight as vital for the portrayal of Captain Janeway. "We have to beg Kate Mulgrew not to lose weight," remarked Costume Designer Robert Blackman, during the making of the series, "because she is very energetic and burns up the calories like there's no tomorrow. So to keep her at a US size 3 or 4 is very difficult sometimes." (Star Trek Monthly issue 9, p. 55)

Brannon Braga found witnessing Kate Mulgrew portray the role of Captain Janeway was particularly informative for writing the character. Mulgrew's habit of frequently placing her hands on her hips, while personifying Janeway, inspired the creation of the Tak Tak body language in "Macrocosm", an episode Braga wrote. (Star Trek: Voyager - A Vision of the Future, pp. 171-172)

Nana Visitor considered auditioning for the role. She commented: "Can you believe I had the nerve? I accosted Rick Berman in the street right in front of Stage 4 at Paramount and said, “Why not? Why? Why can’t I?” Because you know, they had the mix-up, and they fired the person they hired, and all of that stuff. And I said, “I can do both!” … I don’t know what I was thinking. And he was like – he practically patted me on the head, and said, ‘No, we’re gonna get a whole other actress for that". [5]

Apocrypha
The Caretaker novelization gives her name as "Kathryn M. Janeway".

In the Voyager relaunch book series, Admiral Janeway taught at Starfleet Academy with Tuvok.

Janeway was mentioned in the Deep Space Nine book trilogy Millennium. In the book's alternate future, Janeway and Voyager returned to the Alpha Quadrant at an unspecified time. After the destruction of Earth, Janeway, along with The Doctor, Admiral Seven of Nine, and Hugh negotiated an unholy alliance with the Borg, as a desperate measure to stop Weyoun 5 and the Pah-wraiths from destroying the universe. The cornerstone of Janeway's plan was Project Guardian. The goal of Project Guardian was to use the Guardian of Forever to go back in time and destroy Bajor. Although such an act would violate the Temporal Prime Directive, at least it would save the universe. On December 22, 2399, the combined Borg/Federation fleet arrived at the Guardian's planet to find it was interdicted by hostile Grigari forces. What followed was six days of fighting. Finally, on December 28, Janeway and an army of Federation troops made it to the surface, the Guardian in sight. At that moment, Janeway knew that she had won, that victory was in hand. However, the Grigari were ready for her. They activated a singularity bomb, which created a black hole, killing all who were present. Janeway, the Borg and Federation fleets, the Guardian, and the Grigari were all killed. The timeline was later reset thanks to Captain Sisko.

In "Places of Exile", a story in Star Trek: Myriad Universes - Infinity's Prism, an alternate version of Janeway is presented, who becomes stranded in the Delta Quadrant along with the rest of the Voyager crew. She eventually is instrumental in helping to form a Delta Quadrant version of the Federation, as well as beginning a romantic relationship with Chakotay, and bearing his child, Shannon Sekaya Janeway.

In the Star Trek Online multiplayer game, Admiral Janeway is alive and well in the year 2409, and is one of the principal backers of scientific investigation into the supernova of 2387 that destroyed Romulus. When the player speaks to the Trill astronomer Damar Kahn aboard Starbase 114 during the episode titled "Heading Out", this information is revealed through Kahn's dialogue text.

In the Next Generation prequel The Buried Age, then-Lieutenant Janeway participated in an archaeological expedition led by Captain Picard a few years after the destruction of the Stargazer, where a plan of Janeway's to access a location isolated from the rest of the universe by a quantum field results in the accidental death of three of the four aliens trapped there; Janeway later notes that, if placed in a situation where her own interests and the well-being of another race are in conflict, she will choose the second option. When assembling his crew for the USS Enterprise-D, Picard attempted to recruit Janeway for his first officer, but she was on another long-distance assignment and could not be reached.

In the Next Generation relaunch novel Before Dishonor, Janeway was assimilated by the Borg in the year 2380 and is made into their new Queen. An attempt by Seven of Nine to rescue her resulted in the defeat of that Collective, but Janeway herself was apparently killed. Her final fate was left uncertain, as it was implied that she had become a companion of Lady Q. Her death was confirmed in the Full Circle novel.

In the Star Trek: Voyager novel The Eternal Tide, Janeway's consciousness was intercepted by Lady Q as a favor for her son. Lady Q extended the instantaneous moment between life and death experienced by all beings to a point where Janeway exists in this manner for over a year. With assistance by Lady Q, Q Junior, and Kes, Janeway is able to return to her Human body, sans Borg implants, and travel to the Full Circle fleet in the Delta Quadrant in September 2381, in order to aid in Voyager saving the universe from an early death via the Omega Continuum. With the absorption of Fleet Captain Afsarah Eden into the Continuum from whence she came, Starfleet Command places Janeway as the new admiral in command of the USS Voyager and the Full Circle fleet. Meanwhile, Janeway also renews her romantic relationship with Captain Chakotay. The novel A Pocket Full of Lies sees the fleet discover the existence of an alternate version of Janeway created during the events of "Shattered", also revealing that the temporal fracture Voyager experienced during those events was the result of an attack by the Krenim after they became aware of the events of the "erased" Year of Hell in "Year of Hell" and "Year of Hell, Part II". This alternate Janeway had a daughter named Mollah with a Krenim agent.

In the novel To Lose the Earth, the prime timeline Janeway finally married Chakotay with Seven of Nine and B'Elanna serving as bridesmaids.

The Autobiography of Kathryn Janeway reveals that Janeway had a daughter named Amelia who was created by Janeway's mother and sister from Janeway's frozen eggs during the time that Janeway was believed dead. Amelia eventually joined Starfleet.
