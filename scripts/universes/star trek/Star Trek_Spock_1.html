Spock – full name generally considered unpronounceable by Humans – was a male Human/Vulcan hybrid who lived during the 23rd and 24th century. He became one of the most distinguished and respected figures in the United Federation of Planets. (TOS: "This Side of Paradise", "Journey to Babel"; TNG: "Unification I", "Unification II"; VOY: "Alliances", "Endgame")

As a Starfleet officer in the 23rd century, Spock served aboard the starship USS Enterprise as science officer under Captain Christopher Pike, as first officer and science officer under Captain James T. Kirk, and as the commanding officer of the Enterprise during its tenure as a training ship. (TOS: "The Cage", "The Menagerie, Part I", "The Menagerie, Part II", "Where No Man Has Gone Before", "The Corbomite Maneuver"; DIS: "Brother", "If Memory Serves", "Such Sweet Sorrow, Part 2"; Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan)

In the 24th century, Spock became an adviser to the leadership of the Federation and a celebrated ambassador on their behalf. He disappeared in 2387 after saving the Federation from a supernova that destroyed Romulus and caused the creation of the alternate reality. (TNG: "Unification I", "Unification II"; Star Trek).

Childhood
The newborn Spock with his father, Sarek
Spock was born on January 6, 2230 in the city of Shi'Kahr on the planet Vulcan. His mother was Amanda Grayson, a Human school teacher, and his father, Sarek, was a Vulcan scientist and diplomat. (TOS: "The Corbomite Maneuver", "This Side of Paradise", "The Squire of Gothos", "Amok Time"; Star Trek V: The Final Frontier; Star Trek Beyond)

Spock's spartan childhood drawing room on Vulcan
After his half-brother Sybok's mother died, Spock and Sybok were raised as brothers. (Star Trek V: The Final Frontier)

Spock's mixed parentage caused difficulties throughout his early life. His own father, despite having married a Human woman, was ambivalent about his son's half-Human nature at his birth. For her part, Amanda watched Spock's stiff-lipped anguish caused by torment at the hands of other Vulcan children who repeatedly attacked and teased him to provoke emotional responses, knowing that his "Human half" was suffering. (Star Trek V: The Final Frontier; Star Trek; TOS: "Journey to Babel"; TAS: "Yesteryear") Spock himself indicated that emotions confused him. (DIS: "Light and Shadows") 

When Spock was a child, he seemed to have fewer filters, and everything reached him. He also suffered from L'tak Terai, the Vulcan equivalent of dyslexia which he had inherited from his mother. Amanda intervened early on to ensure that her son was able to work past his learning difficulties. As part of her efforts to assist him, Amanda read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass to him. (TAS: "Once Upon a Planet"; DIS: "Context Is for Kings", "Light and Shadows")

As a child, Spock was betrothed to T'Pring in accordance with traditional Vulcan marriage procedure. (TOS: "Amok Time")

Young Spock with "an older cousin"
In 2237, at the age of seven, Spock decided prematurely, and without parental knowledge or approval, to undertake the kahs-wan in the Vulcan wilderness in an attempt to prove himself. His pet sehlat, I-Chaya, tagged along against his master's wishes and defended Spock from a le-matya. The intervention of an older cousin saved Spock from the le-matya but I-Chaya was left badly wounded. Faced with the choice of a painfully extended life or a peaceful release for I-Chaya, Spock logically opted for the latter. That decision marked his choice of following Surak's philosophies of logic and emotional control. In 2269, the accidental creation of an alternate timeline created a universe in which Spock was killed in his childhood. Using the Guardian of Forever, Spock returned to the Vulcan of his youth and assumed the role of Selek, the nearly-forgotten cousin who saved his life during the kahs-wan ordeal. (TAS: "Yesteryear")

Spock often disappeared into the mountains for days as a boy, refusing to tell his father where he had gone or what he had been doing. He ignored Sarek's forbiddance of his trips, and silently endured punishment. (TNG: "Unification I")

Spock meets Michael Burnham for the first time (2230s)
After the apparent death of two Human scientists on Doctari Alpha, Sarek considered it his and Amanda's responsibility to take in the scientists' daughter, Michael Burnham. (DIS: "Battle at the Binary Stars", "The Red Angel", "Brother") Upon being introduced to his new foster sister and being told he was to teach her the ways of Vulcan, Spock was not very welcoming to her. Upon seeing Michael enter the house, he withdrew into his room and drew an image of a dragon-like monster with his computer tablet. He flung the image at her and it screamed at her, after which he shut his door to her. (DIS: "Brother")

Later, however, Spock became what Michael described as her "little shadow." After logic extremists bombed a Vulcan Learning Center targeting Michael, she resolved to run away from home, believing if the logic extremists could not get to her, they would target Spock. Spock confronted her as she tried to leave and tried to convince her to stay. Michael deliberately insulted Spock's parentage to drive him away from her, leaving Spock distraught as she fled. Michael was subsequently found after Spock told his parents where to find her, claiming this information was given to him in a vision from a being he called "the Red Angel." His parents assumed the Angel was a figment of his imagination and that Spock had used logic to pinpoint her direction, but he never wavered from the belief that the Angel was real. Michael's insult to Spock also caused a long-lasting change: He withdrew and lost trust in other people, and his openness vanished. Burnham later reached out many times to make amends but Spock did not appear to be interested. (DIS: "Point of Light", "If Memory Serves")

Spock as a teenager
After Michael's graduation from the Vulcan Science Academy, Sarek was forced to choose between Michael and Spock as to who should join the Vulcan Expeditionary Group. He chose Spock over Michael but he came to regret this decision as Spock chose to join Starfleet instead. Sarek had given Spock his first lessons in computers and set him on a path of science. Therefore, Spock's preference to pursue a scientific career in Starfleet caused a rift between him and his father that kept them from speaking to each other for eighteen years. (TOS: "Journey to Babel"; DIS: "Lethe")

Starfleet career
Starfleet Academy
During his time at Starfleet Academy, Spock had Onafuwa for Fundamentals of Quantum Stochastics and several other advanced courses. He was commissioned as a Starfleet officer in 2250 with the serial number S 179-276 SP and held an A7 computer expert classification. In 2254, he was assigned to the USS Enterprise under the command of Captain Christopher Pike. (ST: "Q&A"; TOS: "The Enterprise Incident", "Court Martial", "The Ultimate Computer", "The Cage")

Serving under Christopher Pike
Arrival on the Enterprise
When Ensign Spock was transported aboard the Enterprise in 2254, he bonded with the ship's first officer, Lieutenant Commander Una who preferred to be known simply as "Number One." When they became trapped in the turbolift while on their way to the bridge, Spock asked Una many questions and the two opened up to each other. Later that year, he was promoted to lieutenant. (ST: "Q&A"; TOS: "The Cage")

Rescuing Pike from the Talosians
Spock in 2254
As a science officer under the command of Captain Pike, Spock was wounded in the leg when Pike's landing party was attacked on Rigel VII in 2254. As the ship proceeded to the Vega colony for medical care, a radio wave distress call forced Pike to divert the ship to Talos IV. Still limping, Spock joined a landing party that transported to the barren surface of the planet where Talosians captured Pike. He was the first of the ship's crew to realize the Talosians had powerful illusory abilities. Spock's final report, along with Pike's, recommended a ban on visitation to the planet. Starfleet's General Order 7 supported that judgment. (TOS: "The Cage", "The Menagerie, Part I", "The Menagerie, Part II")

Searching for the Red Angel
Spock in 2257
Following the end of the Federation-Klingon War in 2257, Spock took an unspecified leave of absence from Starfleet. He had accumulated a number of months during the five-year mission which, according to Pike, took a toll on the whole crew as well as Spock. Upon reviewing Spock's personal log entries on the Enterprise, Michael Burnham learned that Spock had been having visions ever since he was a boy, and that he had had premonitions of the mysterious red bursts that the USS Discovery was likewise investigating, which Spock believed were related to his childhood visions of "the Red Angel." (DIS: "Brother")

Spock followed his visions to an unknown planet where he encountered the Red Angel. Through a mind meld, he discovered that it was a Human but one clad in a suit far beyond 23rd century technology. Through the meld, he received a vision of the destruction of Earth, Vulcan, Andor, and Tellar, and began experiencing time non-linearly. (DIS: "If Memory Serves") He decided to have himself committed to the psychiatric unit on Starbase 5. In doing so, he requested that Starfleet not inform his family about the matter, including his father and foster sister. While there, he was observed to display acutely emotional dissociation and extreme empathy deficits. When he was told the red bursts had occurred as he had predicted, Spock broke out of the facility, disabling three of his doctors with Vulcan nerve pinches and fleeing on a shuttlecraft. (DIS: "New Eden", "Point of Light", "If Memory Serves")

Starfleet subsequently claimed that Spock had murdered his doctors and made finding him a priority. The USS Discovery and Section 31 became involved in the search. Aware he was being pursued, Spock abandoned his shuttlecraft in the Mutara sector and secretly returned to Vulcan. There, his mother hid him in a sacred crypt where katra stones shielded him from telepathic searches. Spock had become delusional and incoherent, unable to bear the experience of viewing time non-linearly, and repeated the First Doctrines of Logic and a sequence of numbers over and over. Burnham convinced Amanda to take her to Spock, but Sarek followed Burnham and convinced her that the best way to help Spock was to hand him over to Section 31. Burnham took Spock to the Section 31 ship NCIA-93 where Captain Leland promised he would help repair Spock's mind. However, Philippa Georgiou warned Burnham that Leland intended to extract Spock's memories using a process that would destroy his mind. At Georgiou's suggestion, Burnham overpowered her and took Spock from the Section 31 ship in a shuttlecraft. (DIS: "Saints of Imperfection", "Light and Shadows")

Burnham realized that, since Spock's mind had regressed to childhood, the sequence of numbers he had been repeating was reversed due to his L'tak Terai. In the opposite order, the numbers represented the coordinates for Talos IV. Burnham thus set a course for that planet. There, the Talosians and Vina agreed to help heal Spock and subsequently projected illusions to the pursuing NCIA-93 to allow Burnham and Spock to escape to the USS Discovery. (DIS: "Light and Shadows", "If Memory Serves")

Return to Starfleet
Spock in 2258
After the battle against Control, Spock returned to his position as science officer aboard the Enterprise in 2258. He was sworn to secrecy, along with the rest of the crew of Pike's starship, to never again speak the name of his adoptive sister or the ship she served on aloud in public again. (DIS: "Such Sweet Sorrow, Part 2")

Meeting Leila Kalomi
On Earth briefly in 2261, Spock met Leila Kalomi. Although she declared a love for Spock, his Vulcan control prevented him from reciprocating until 2267 when he was infected by the spores on Omicron Ceti III. Under the spores' influence, he became peaceful and happy but Captain Kirk infuriated him, which killed the spores and returned him to normal. (TOS: "This Side of Paradise")

Spock's service under Pike (eleven years, four months, and five days) inspired considerable respect and loyalty from the young officer. In 2267, Spock risked his life and career for the sake of his former captain. (TOS: "The Cage", "The Menagerie, Part I", "The Menagerie, Part II")

Serving under James T. Kirk
Year One
Lieutenant Commander Spock in 2265
After Pike's promotion to fleet captain, James T. Kirk assumed command of the Enterprise in 2265, with Spock as his first officer. An early mission proved disastrous when Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell, a close friend of the new captain, developed enhanced psionic abilities when the Enterprise encountered an energy barrier at the edge of the Milky Way Galaxy.

Spock and Kirk in 2265
Spock examined the tapes of an earlier ship, the SS Valiant, that had encountered the same barrier and was destroyed. As Mitchell's powers increased, Spock believed he had become extremely dangerous and feared that he would destroy the Enterprise. He therefore advised Kirk to either strand Mitchell on the uninhabited and desolate Delta Vega to isolate him from galactic civilization or kill Mitchell before it was too late. Kirk hesitated but initially attempted the former, but the scope of Spock's concerns were eventually borne out and Kirk was forced to kill Mitchell. (TOS: "Where No Man Has Gone Before")

Year Two
The Enterprise repelled the first Romulan incursion of Federation space in over a century on stardate 1709.2. Spock and the bridge crew became the first Starfleet officers to make visual contact with Romulans who finally revealed their Vulcan-like appearance to Starfleet. Lieutenant Stiles briefly suspected Spock of being a Romulan agent until Spock saved his life in the course of battle. (TOS: "Balance of Terror")

Year Three
Spock kidnapped Fleet Captain Pike and hijacked the Enterprise. Pike had been crippled and was confined to a wheelchair, unable to speak, as a result of an accident. Spock wanted to return him to Talos IV; he wished to return Pike to the Talosians there so he could enjoy the rest of his life in an illusory reality and would not have to continue enduring his disability. After a lengthy inquiry into the matter, and in light of the Talosian-provided images, Kirk allowed Pike to beam down. Commodore Jose I. Mendez also dropped all charges against Spock. (TOS: "The Menagerie, Part I", "The Menagerie, Part II")

While commanding an away mission aboard the Galileo on stardate 2821.5, the shuttlecraft crashed on the surface of Taurus II. Giant hostile creatures killed two crewmembers while the shuttle was stranded there. Spock, aided by Lieutenant Commander Montgomery Scott, eventually launched the shuttle. Knowing that it could not break free of the planet's gravity, Spock ignited the shuttlecraft's remaining fuel to use it as a flare. His gamble paid off; it alerted the Enterprise which turned around and rescued the team. (TOS: "The Galileo Seven")

Spock in command of the Enterprise after the Metrons abduct Kirk
After being thrown back in time to Earth of 1969 and interacting with that planet's US Air Force, Spock was able to recreate a time warp with a slingshot maneuver around the sun. (TOS: "Tomorrow is Yesterday")

Spock being questioned at Kirk's trial in 2267
When Kirk was court-martialed for causing the death of Lieutenant Commander Benjamin Finney, Spock proved that Finney had altered the Enterprise's computer tapes to frame Kirk, by beating the computer at chess four times in a row, something which would ordinarily be impossible. (TOS: "Court Martial")

Spock confronts Landru with Kirk
Spock, along with Kirk, helped disable Landru, a computer that controlled the lives of a civilization on Beta III and allowed no free thought or creative thinking. (TOS: "The Return of the Archons")

Spock helped Kirk to retake the Enterprise after Khan Noonien Singh, a 20th century Augment dictator whom the Enterprise's crew had found in stasis, commandeered the starship. He flooded the ship with gas, disabling Khan and his followers. (TOS: "Space Seed")

On stardate 3192.1, Spock and Kirk were taken prisoners on Eminiar VII which had been at war for over five hundred years with Vendikar. Computers fought the war virtually so that the destruction of actual warfare did not devastate the two worlds, thus preserving both civilizations. Whenever the computer registered a hit, the affected citizens reported to a disintegration chamber where they were vaporized. When the Enterprise entered orbit around Eminiar VII, it became a legitimate target for Vendikar. The war computer soon declared that a tricobalt satellite explosion had destroyed the Enterprise; as a result, Eminiar officials expected the crew to report to the disintegration stations. They abducted Kirk and Spock to ensure compliance, but the two escaped captivity and destroyed the computers on Eminiar VII. With the threat of a real war looming over the inhabitants of both planets, Spock and Kirk negotiated a peace between Eminiar VII and Vendikar. (TOS: "A Taste of Armageddon")

On the mining planet Janus VI, an unknown creature was killing miners there. After locating the creature, Spock mind melded with it. He discovered that the creature was called a Horta and determined that its killing of the miners was an attempt to protect its young. The miners had been unintentionally killing the Horta's offspring by destroying silicon nodules which were really the creature's eggs. Spock negotiated a pact between the Horta and the miners: The miners would leave the eggs alone and the Horta, in turn, would help the miners locate valuable minerals. (TOS: "The Devil in the Dark")

Spock is forced to use a destructive measure in order to protect the Federation
Spock and Kirk later became trapped on Organia during a Klingon occupation of that planet. The Klingons wanted to use Organia as a base in their war against the Federation. The Organian council refused the Federation's help, and after the Klingons invaded and took control of Organia, Kirk and Spock had civilian identities imposed on them, with Spock being given the identity of a merchant. They then became involved in sabotage. After the Klingons captured them, the Organians set Spock and Kirk free. Just as war began to break out, the Organians revealed themselves to be powerful energy beings. They neutralized both sides weaponry and stopped the war. (TOS: "Errand of Mercy")

On stardate 3134.0, Spock and Kirk traveled back in time using the Guardian of Forever to retrieve Dr. Leonard McCoy who had entered the time portal and somehow changed history. Spock discovered McCoy saved the life of Edith Keeler who, in the altered timeline, led a pacifist movement that delayed the United States of America's entry into World War II, thus allowing Adolf Hitler to win the war. Spock persuaded Kirk that allowing Keeler to die in an auto accident was only way to restore the timeline. (TOS: "The City on the Edge of Forever")

A neural parasite attacking Spock
Near the end of the year, a Denevan neural parasite that destroyed the colony on Deneva also attacked Spock. He submitted to an experiment that destroyed the creature inside him but also left him blind. However, the blindness was only temporary due to an inner set of eyelids that all Vulcans possessed. (TOS: "Operation -- Annihilate!")

Commander Spock in 2267
In late 2267, the Enterprise encountered a probe called Nomad that had destroyed multiple star systems and their inhabitants. Spock mind-melded with the probe and discovered it was an old Earth probe originally tasked with seeking out new life. Somehow damaged in space, it had merged with an alien probe on a mission to sterilize "imperfect" biological organisms from soil. These two missions had merged into sterilizing or improving anything that was not "perfect." Using its own logic against it, Kirk destroyed the probe. (TOS: "The Changeling")

On stardate 3219.8, an alien cloud creature took control of a shuttlecraft carrying Spock, Kirk, and Federation diplomat Nancy Hedford, landing it on a deserted planet. There, they found Zefram Cochrane, the inventor of Earth's warp drive who was believed to have died decades ago. The cloud creature, which Cochrane called the "Companion", had discovered him and kept him alive and young. The creature had brought the three Starfleet officers to be companions for Cochrane. When Spock tried to repair the shuttlecraft, the Companion stopped him. The situation was resolved when the Companion joined with Hedford, who was terminally ill, and cured her. Hedford/The Companion remained on the planet with Cochrane. (TOS: "Metamorphosis")

Year Four
At some point around Spock's fourth year on the Enterprise, he was offered an assignment with Medusan Ambassador Kollos which he turned down, as he claimed that he "was unable to accept," as his "life is here," aboard the Enterprise. The assignment, instead, went to Miranda Jones. (TOS: "Is There in Truth No Beauty?")

In 2268, Spock and other crewmembers of the Enterprise encountered Harry Mudd stranded on a planet of androids. The androids wanted the Enterprise to escape the planet and serve Humans so that they would not have to explore space. Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the crew eventually managed to overload the androids' central control by acting in a illogical manner, causing the chief android, Norman, to have a breakdown. (TOS: "I, Mudd")

While traveling to a peace conference on Babel, Spock was reunited with his parents. There was still much friction between Spock and his father. When Sarek was accused of the murder of another delegate, it was revealed that he was ill with a cardiac defect which made it unlikely that he could have committed the crime. McCoy was then tasked with performing surgery on Sarek while in a space battle with an enemy ship. It was then discovered that Orions were responsible for the murder, and Spock made himself available for a blood transfusion for his father's surgery because they shared the same rare blood type, T-negative. Recovering in sickbay, Sarek and Spock made peace with each other, even playfully teasing Amanda. (TOS: "Journey to Babel")

On stardate 4523.3, Spock helped foil a Klingon plot to poison quadrotriticale earmarked for Sherman's Planet while at the same time trying to clear the Enterprise of a fast-breeding alien species called tribbles. (TOS: "The Trouble with Tribbles"; DS9: "Trials and Tribble-ations")

Spock later visited Sigma Iotia II whose inhabitants had modeled their society on the gangster era of Earth's 1930s. An earlier starship had left behind a book about gangsters from Earth's 20th century that the imitative Iotians had used as a blueprint for their society. Spock played the part of one of the bosses of the main syndicate, "The Federation," and helped Kirk unite the two warring bosses into a form of government. (TOS: "A Piece of the Action")

Spock sensing the terrible deaths of an entire Vulcan crew
Spock, along with the Enterprise, encountered a space amoeba that destroyed entire star systems. The USS Intrepid, which was sent to investigate the phenomenon, was destroyed, and Spock felt the Vulcans on the ship dying. In order to gain information on the creature, Spock piloted a shuttle into the amoeba and found that it was about to reproduce by fission. He subsequently destroyed the creature with an antimatter bomb. (TOS: "The Immunity Syndrome")

Spock's body was later taken over by Henoch, one of three survivors of an ancient civilization that had destroyed itself. The three had become energy beings to survive and wished to build androids to house their minds. Henoch, the rival of fellow survivor Sargon, refused to relinquish Spock's body and attempted to kill Sargon. He himself was killed with the help of Spock's consciousness and Sargon's wife Thalassa. (TOS: "Return to Tomorrow")

Ekosian Nazis capture Spock
Spock came in contact with various other worlds in the early part of 2268. He was captured by Ekosians who had based their society on that of Nazi Germany and tortured him for information about the Enterprise. John Gill, a Federation historian, had visited Ekos and attempted to use the efficiency of Nazi Germany to bring stability to the planet. Toward the end of the encounter, it was found out that Gill was drugged by his deputy Melakon. Through the use of the mind meld, Spock helped bring Gill to almost full wakefulness. (TOS: "Patterns of Force")

Spock battled Kelvans who tried to take over the Enterprise in order to return to their homeworld in the Andromeda Galaxy. He helped Kirk stop Ronald Tracey, a Federation captain interfering in Omega IV's societies by arming the Kohms against the Yangs. He battled the government of a planet where a Rome-like civilization had never fallen and gladiatorial games still took place in the planet's modern era. (TOS: "By Any Other Name", "The Omega Glory", "Bread and Circuses")

Spock's mindless body equipped with a neural stimulator after the Eymorgs stole his brain
Later the same year, Spock's brain was stolen by the Eymorgs to help power the Great Teacher that controlled their society and provided for all their needs. McCoy was able to reconnect Spock's brain to his body with the same technology used to remove it. (TOS: "Spock's Brain")

Spock, along with Kirk, stole a cloaking device from the Romulans. As part of the plan to retrieve the device, he pretended to kill Kirk in self-defense and romanced the craft's commander in order to gain her trust. He initially intended only to carry out his mission but experienced actual feelings for the beautiful and brilliant commander. After Kirk returned to the Romulans' craft disguised as a Romulan and stole the device, Spock stalled the Romulans long enough for the device to be installed in the Enterprise. The ship escaped with the cloaking device and the Romulan commander on board, who made a pact with Spock to keep their mutual feelings for the other a secret. (TOS: "The Enterprise Incident")

Spock later saved Kirk and a tribe of transplanted Native Americans when he helped save their planet Amerind from an asteroid by activating a deflector beam. (TOS: "The Paradise Syndrome") He allowed Kollos to take over his body so that he could guide the Enterprise back into the galaxy after a mad Larry Marvick had driven it into an uncharted region. The Medeusans were a highly intelligent species but their bodies were grotesque in form – so much so that gazing upon a Medeusan would cause instant insanity in humanoids. However, it was said that telepathically viewing a Medeusan's mind, as Spock did, was quite a beautiful experience. (TOS: "Is There in Truth No Beauty?")

Spock helped save an landing party from the Melkotians who had, as punishment for trespassing, forced them to relive the infamous gunfight at the OK Corral in a recreation of Tombstone, Arizona. (TOS: "Spectre of the Gun") He also helped redirect Yonada from colliding with Daran V. (TOS: "For the World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky")

Spock took command of the Enterprise when a spatial interphase trapped Kirk between universes. Despite a Tholian attack from Commander Loskene, Spock and the Enterprise crew managed to retrieve Kirk and escaped from the Tholians' energy web. (TOS: "The Tholian Web")

A race of psychokinetics later captured Spock, Kirk, and McCoy. The aliens forced them to take part in dangerous games and unwanted love affairs. (TOS: "Plato's Stepchildren")

After hyper-accelerated aliens took over the Enterprise and hyper-accelerated Kirk to take as a hostage, Spock managed to receive a warning from Kirk and became hyper-accelerated himself but carried an antidote with him. He and Kirk stopped the aliens and retook the ship. (TOS: "Wink of an Eye")

Spock was part of a landing party that aliens were using to test the worthiness of an empathic race. A supernova was going to destroy their planetary system, and the aliens wanted to see if their race should be saved. After the aliens tortured Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, the empath Gem healed them. Impressed by this, the aliens saved her planet. (TOS: "The Empath")

Year Five

In early 2269, Spock and Kirk took a new medicine that could cure mental illness to a Federation mental facility. However, under the leadership of former Starfleet captain Garth of Izar, inmates had taken over the facility. Garth captured Spock and Kirk, putting their lives in danger. Spock escaped and found Kirk but Garth, who had developed shapeshifting powers, had assumed Kirk's identity. Spock determined the real Kirk from the impostor and subdued Garth, thus giving him medication that helped his mental illness. (TOS: "Whom Gods Destroy")

In the same year, Spock was part of a landing party that found a Human named Flint. He found masterpiece paintings and original classical music. Flint admitted that he had been Johannes Brahms and Leonardo da Vinci on Earth, and that he was an immortal being. (TOS: "Requiem for Methuselah")

Spock with Droxine
Spock helped Kirk negotiate a peace treaty between two societies on Ardana. He also became attracted to Droxine, the daughter of Plasus, the ruler of Ardana; he referred to her as a work of art and even discussed pon farr with her. However, nothing ever came out of the relationship. (TOS: "The Cloud Minders")

The Excalbians forced Spock and Kirk into a battle between good and evil to study Human concepts. The aliens created images of people who possessed "good" qualities, such as Abraham Lincoln and Surak, against "bad" people such as Colonel Phillip Green and Kahless. (TOS: "The Savage Curtain")

Spock, Kirk, and McCoy entered a time portal, and were stuck in different past eras of Sarpeidon which was about to be destroyed by an exploding sun. Spock and McCoy traveled into the planet's ice age where they met Zarabeth, who had been sent there as punishment. Even though McCoy was dying from the cold, Spock wished to remain with the woman with whom he had fallen in love since, in this time period, he had emotions. Eventually, he discovered the portal door and saved McCoy. (TOS: "All Our Yesterdays") 

After Janice Lester transferred her consciousness into Kirk's body and his consciousness into her body, she attempted to kill Kirk and assume his captaincy. However, Spock managed to expose her and helped to re-transfer Kirk's consciousness into his body. (TOS: "Turnabout Intruder")

Spock joined a landing party that beamed down to inspect the second planet of the Taurean system. There, he became affected by the glandular secretion of the female members of Theela's species who inhabited there, who were known for controlling the male mind. This drained Spock of his "life force," causing him to age at a rate of ten years per day. Spock escaped the females of the planet and contacted the Enterprise. An all-female security detachment led by Lieutenant Nyota Uhura eventually recovered him and the landing party. By using their molecular pattern stored in the transporter system, Spock and the others were returned to their previous ages. (TAS: "The Lorelei Signal")

Spock Two performing a mind meld on Spock
On a mission to Phylos, Spock was captured by Stavos Keniclius who planned to clone him and make an army of Spock clones to enforce an era of peace throughout the galaxy. His first clone, Spock Two, possessed all of the original's memories, abilities, and sense of logic. However, the cloning process left the original Spock near death. Since Spock Two possessed his progenitor's sense of logic, he mind melded with him and restored his mind, most likely transferring his katra back into the original Spock. The original Spock proposed that Spock Two remain on Phylos to help Keniclius rebuild the Phylosian society. (TAS: "The Infinite Vulcan")

Purging emotions
After completing the Enterprise's five-year mission of exploration, Spock chose to return to his home planet. As a result of his occasional displays of emotion during his Enterprise missions, he decided to undergo the kolinahr ritual to purge himself of the last vestiges of emotion. (Star Trek: The Motion Picture)

V'ger crisis
Spock during his kolinahr
Two and half years after leaving Starfleet, Spock felt the arrival of a vast consciousness. He aborted his kolinahr training and resumed his Starfleet career both for personal reasons and to help Rear Admiral Kirk during the V'ger incident. Spock's return to Starfleet amazed former colleagues and others but his reputation remained excellent, with Commander Will Decker stating that he was "well-aware of Mr. Spock's qualifications" when Spock offered to again serve as science officer. Within three hours, he helped Scott repair the Enterprise's malfunctioning warp drive.(Star Trek: The Motion Picture)

Commander Spock in the 2270s
Spock's attitude towards his colleagues was far different from when he had served with them during the five-year mission. Wishing to rid himself of any personal attachments to Starfleet, he no longer considered any of the crew to be his friends and barely acknowledged them upon his return except where his duties demanded it. Feeling that the consciousness would answer for his quest, he broke into an airlock and stole a thruster suit. He exited the ship and proceeded to the next chamber of the mechanism, witnessing a planet populated by living machines. There, he attempted a mind meld and he realized V'ger's quest. Knocked unconscious by the enormous power of V'ger during the meld, Spock was recovered in open space by Kirk. Later, he was in sickbay being treated for neurological trauma. He informed Kirk that V'ger was a life-form of its own, seeking answers to its questions; specifically "Is this all that I am? Is there nothing more?" Grasping Kirk's hand while lying on a biobed, Spock told Kirk that the simple feeling of touching another was something beyond V'ger's comprehension. 

Spock later accompanied Kirk, Decker, and McCoy to the heart of V'ger, guided by the Ilia probe. The group discovered V'ger was actually the 20th century NASA probe Voyager 6. Spock deduced that the old probe was found by the living machine inhabitants of a planet located on the other side of the galaxy and they built the mammoth vessel so it could fulfill Voyager's simple programming, "learn all that is learnable." Spock told Kirk that V'ger had to evolve, as its knowledge had reached the limits of the known universe. 

Spock informed McCoy and the others that other dimensions and higher levels of being could not be proven logically and V'ger was therefore incapable of believing in them, needing the Human quality to leap beyond logic. Decker chose to merge with V'ger, and Kirk, McCoy, and Spock escaped shortly thereafter when it and Decker evolved into another dimension. Afterwards, Spock chose to remain on the Enterprise rather than return to his homeworld, his experience with V'ger showing him that purging his emotions and operating on pure logic would not answer his questions but would simply create new ones. (Star Trek: The Motion Picture)

Death and resurrection
Sometime after the V'ger incident, Spock was promoted to captain and assigned to Starfleet Academy where he trained cadets on the Enterprise which had been retired from active service.

The death of Spock in 2285
In early 2285, Spock, while on a training mission, ceded command of the Enterprise to Kirk during a mission that involved keeping the Genesis Device from Khan Noonien Singh. When Kirk and the Enterprise defeated Khan, he armed the device. Spock repaired the Enterprise's warp drive in a severely irradiated portion of engineering in order to save the crew. He saved the ship but sacrificed his own life in the process. Following his funeral service, Kirk gave Spock a "burial by sea" by firing Spock's body into space inside a torpedo casing. (Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan)

Spock, resurrected on Mount Seleya
Spock's coffin landed on the surface of the Genesis Planet. The radiation emanating from the planet regenerated his cells. Spock was thus reborn as a child but quickly aged to adulthood. However, his mind was a complete blank. Kirk and the rest of the Enterprise's senior staff disobeyed Starfleet orders so that they could retrieve Spock's body. On Vulcan, Spock's living body, now at the age of his death, was reunited with his katra which Spock himself had placed in McCoy prior to his death via mind meld. (Star Trek III: The Search for Spock)

After his katra and body were re-integrated, Spock trained for three months with the help of his mother to bring his knowledge and intellect back to where it had been before he died. Answering many complicated questions at rapid fire during his memory test, he had difficulty answering the question "How do you feel?", something he felt was irrelevant, though his mother disagreed. Returning back to Earth aboard the HMS Bounty with his Enterprise crewmates to offer testimony in their defense to the Federation Council, Spock and the crew discovered that the planet was under siege by a mysterious alien probe which was causing critical damage to Earth's oceans. Analyzing the transmission the probe was producing, Spock concluded that the probe was transmitting the songs sung by whales, specifically humpback whales. Spock informed Kirk that the humpback whales had been extinct since the 21st century and suggested the crew travel back through time to acquire humpback whales. Spock's calculations from memory for the slingshot effect around Sol proved instrumental in the Bounty's successful journey back to the year 1986.

Spock, with Kirk in San Francisco in 1986
Upon the landing of the cloaked Bird-of-Prey in Golden Gate Park, Spock teamed up with Kirk and together they set off in search of humpback whales. The pair discovered George and Gracie at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Spock jumped into the whales' tank and mind melded with Gracie, discovering she was very pregnant. After traveling back to 2286 with the whales and cetacean biologist Gillian Taylor, Spock and the rest of the crew saved Earth once again by releasing George and Gracie into the San Francisco Bay from the sunken Bounty. The whales successfully communicated with the probe and it left Earth's solar system. After the dismissal of all charges to the crew of the Enterprise, save for Kirk, Spock spoke to his father and asked him to relay a message to his mother: That he felt fine. Spock went on to serve as a Starfleet officer for several more years aboard the new USS Enterprise-A. (Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home)

The Enterprise-A
Prior to the launch of the new Enterprise, Spock was recruited to test the new brig as he was the most intelligent and resourceful person the designers could find. However, despite his ingenuity, he failed to escape. (Star Trek V: The Final Frontier)

Spock joined Kirk and McCoy for shore leave at Yosemite National Park and observed Kirk climbing El Capitan with his levitation boots. He saved Kirk's life when he slipped and fell off of the mountain, grabbing his ankle just seconds before he was killed by the impact. Later, Spock told Kirk and McCoy that before leaving the Enterprise-A, he had studied all the details involving "camping out" and roasted a marshmallow over a fire. Spock's shore leave was interrupted when Commander Uhura brought the shuttlecraft Galileo to the trio's campsite to bring them to the Enterprise as the transporters were malfunctioning.

Spock says goodbye to his half-brother Sybok
Upon the Enterprise's mission to Nimbus III to resolve a hostage situation, Kirk retained Spock as his first officer. During the Enterprise strike team's rescue mission to Paradise City on Nimbus III, Spock discovered his long-lost half-brother Sybok had been the leader of the Galactic Army of Light, the group responsible for capturing the three diplomats. Sybok hijacked the Enterprise and ordered that it be brought through the Great Barrier. During the subsequent voyage in the shuttle Copernicus to the mythical Sha Ka Ree, Spock tried to console his brother when they could not initially find "God" on the surface. 

Shortly thereafter, the landing party encountered the supernatural being when it presented itself to them. Learning of the malevolent nature of the being calling itself "God", Sybok sacrificed his life to save Spock and his friends. Spock and McCoy were beamed up to the Enterprise through the repaired transporter, leaving Kirk alone. The transporter was severely damaged when Klaa's Bird-of-Prey fired on the Enterprise. Spock saved Kirk's life from the entity by commandeering the Bird-of-Prey with the help of General Korrd and firing on it with the Klingon ship's weapons. Later, in the Enterprise-A's observation lounge, Spock reflected on the loss of his brother. Kirk told him that he had lost a brother once, but he was fortunate in that he got him back. Returning to Earth, Spock resumed his shore leave in Yosemite with Kirk and McCoy, this time playing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" on his Vulcan lute. (Star Trek V: The Final Frontier)

In 2293, Spock was chosen to be the Federation's special envoy to the "Gorkon Initiative" as it was he who opened secret talks with Chancellor Gorkon following the Praxis disaster. Spock later committed Kirk to the negotiations with the Klingon Empire. During Kirk and McCoy's subsequent trial and imprisonment for the assassination of Gorkon, Spock took command of the Enterprise and the murder investigation. He led the rescue mission of Kirk and McCoy from Rura Penthe and helped stop an assassination attempt on the Federation President. Though this mission was successful, Spock blamed himself for endangering Kirk and the consequences that followed, a guilt that lasted seventy-five years. (Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country; TNG: "Unification II")

Diplomatic career
Captain Spock (2293)
In 2293, on the suggestion of his father, Spock opened a dialog with Gorkon in the hopes of initiating peace talks. He recommended an alliance between the Klingon Empire and the Federation at the Khitomer Conference, and Gorkon agreed to negotiate. His recommendation produced a major dispute because the Federation viewed Klingons as outlaws who built their empire through violence and brutality. Despite seemingly insurmountable odds, an alliance was nevertheless forged, bringing peace and stability to the Alpha Quadrant that had not existed for two hundred years. Tuvok, who initially opposed the alliance, later noted that "Spock's suggestion, so controversial at first, proved to be the cornerstone of peace." (Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country; VOY: "Alliances")

Also during the Khitomer Conference, Spock opened up negotiations with Ambassador Pardek of Romulus in an attempt to unify Vulcan and the Romulan Star Empire. (TNG: "Unification I", "Unification II")

Ambassador Spock in 2368
Spock and Sarek publicly disagreed over issues involving the Cardassians, leading to a rift in their relationship. (TNG: "Unification I")

In his later years, Spock went into semi-retirement, choosing to act as a Federation ambassador, much as his father had done. (TNG: "Unification I")

Reunification attempts
In 2368, Spock undertook a secret personal mission to Romulus, unauthorized by the Federation Council or Starfleet. As he knew it would be risky, he preferred not to involve others and wrapped up his affairs. He acted to facilitate Romulan-Vulcan reunification, avoiding contact with the rest of the Federation as he was reluctant to risk anyone's life but his own on such a mission after the near-fatal consequences to Kirk and McCoy in their involvement in the Khitomer conference. Captain Jean-Luc Picard met Spock on Romulus and informed him of his father's death. Before Picard's departure, the two mind-melded, allowing Spock to realize the depth of his father's feelings for him. (TNG: "Unification I", "Unification II")

In 3189, a recording of Spock made on stardate 45825 while on Romulus was retrieved from the personal files of Admiral Picard and viewed by Michael Burnham and Cleveland Booker. (DIS: "Unification III")

"Cowboy diplomacy"
In 2369, Spock was involved in an incident of "cowboy diplomacy" in which Deanna Troi was temporarily kidnapped to help with the defection of three Romulans, including Vice-Proconsul M'ret, to the Federation. He also had a message sent back to the Federation indirectly through the defector DeSeve. (TNG: "Face of the Enemy")
