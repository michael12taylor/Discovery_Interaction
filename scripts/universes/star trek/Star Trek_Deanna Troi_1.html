Deanna Troi was a female Betazoid–Human hybrid Starfleet officer. Under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, she served as the counselor aboard the USS Enterprise-D and the USS Enterprise-E. In 2379, Troi transferred to the USS Titan (Star Trek: The Next Generation; Star Trek Nemesis). By 2399, she and her husband William T. Riker lived on the planet Nepenthe with their daughter, Kestra Troi-Riker. Their son, Thaddeus Troi-Riker, died of Mendaxic neurosclerosis soon after their arrival on Nepenthe.

As a half-Betazoid, Troi was capable of extra-sensory empathy, but was incapable of reading aliens with brain structures dissimilar to Humans and other Betazoids, such as the Breen and the Ferengi. Like most Betazoids, Troi had telepathic abilities. Due to her half-Human heritage, however, the range of her telepathic abilities was limited compared to full-blooded Betazoids, and she could usually only read the thoughts of other Betazoids, most notably her mother. Troi's empathic skills made her an important asset to the Enterprise-D and her abilities were often particularly useful when dealing with hostile races. Since she could usually determine, through use of her abilities, whether others were lying, she repeatedly proved herself invaluable in many suspenseful situations.

Early life and career
Deanna Troi as an infant
Deanna was born on March 29, 2336, near Lake El'nar on Betazed. She was born to Betazoid Ambassador Lwaxana Troi and Human Starfleet officer Ian Andrew Troi. Deanna was actually the second of their two children, the first being Kestra Troi, born in 2330. However, Kestra drowned when Deanna was an infant. Stricken with grief and regret, Lwaxana removed all evidence of Kestra's existence from her own life and even repressed all memories of Kestra. She also made her husband swear never to mention Kestra again. Because of this, Deanna did not learn of her sister until 2370, when Lwaxana's memories resurfaced. (TNG: "Conundrum", "Dark Page")

As required by Betazoid custom, Deanna was genetically bonded with a Human male named Wyatt Miller at a young age. Wyatt was the son of Steven and Victoria Miller, close friends of Deanna's parents. Due to their genetic bonding, Deanna was scheduled to marry Wyatt in adulthood. (TNG: "Haven")

According to her mother, Deanna had a talent for languages as a child. (TNG: "Dark Page") During her adult life, Deanna also recalled having visited Enterprise NX-01 as a little girl, although she was not absolutely sure, as she always got "those museum ships" mixed up. (ENT: "These Are the Voyages...")

As a child living on Betazed, Deanna learned aspects of Human culture from her Human father, Ian. One such aspect was a fondness for stories set during Earth's Ancient West, which he often read to her. (TNG: "A Fistful of Datas") To fall asleep, she would ask him to sing the American song "Down in the Valley"; while this was her favorite, it was his singing that made her feel safe. (TNG: "Dark Page") As she was half-Human and half-Betazoid, she never felt trapped between the two worlds to which she belonged, instead choosing to embrace the richness of her dual heritage. (TNG: "The Emissary") She also heard stories from her maternal grandfather, who told them telepathically; something of a traditionalist, he rarely spoke, saying speech was for "offworlders and people who didn't know any better." (TNG: "Eye of the Beholder")

Deanna's father died in 2343, when Deanna was only seven years old. Even so, she remembered him fondly, and when she became pregnant by an alien energy being in 2365, she named the child after her father. (TNG: "Half a Life", "Dark Page", "The Child")

In grammar school, Deanna had to memorize Jonathan Archer's speech at the Federation Founding Ceremony. (ENT: "These Are the Voyages...") Deanna began studying psychology at the University of Betazed sometime in the 2350s. During her time there, one of her patients was Tam Elbrun, a Betazoid male who had been suffering from mental instability due to his lack of the Betazoid's natural ability to "tune out" the thoughts of others. (TNG: "Tin Man")

Janaran Falls was where Deanna and William Riker spent their last night together
Deanna Troi entered Starfleet Academy in 2355. She graduated in 2359, majoring in psychology. (TNG: "Conundrum") On her homeworld of Betazed, she met William T. Riker, a Starfleet lieutenant who was stationed on the planet. The two began a relationship sometime between 2357 and 2361, and the relationship lasted several years. After Riker was assigned to the USS Potemkin, the two planned to spend their holidays together on Risa in 2361. However, Will had to cancel their plans after he was quickly promoted to lieutenant commander – deciding to make his career his top priority, Will stopped pursuing Deanna, and the couple eventually lost contact with each other. (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint", "Ménage à Troi", "Second Chances") By 2364, Troi held the rank of lieutenant commander. That year, she was assigned as ship's counselor aboard the USS Enterprise-D. (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint")

Aboard the USS Enterprise-D
2364-2365
Troi during the Farpoint Mission
Troi proved herself to be an important asset to the crew of the Enterprise-D during the ship's first mission to Farpoint Station in 2364. Her ability to sense feelings and emotions yielded vital clues which allowed the crew to determine that the station was actually a shapeshifting space vessel lifeform being forced into servitude by the Bandi. By rescuing the creature and reuniting it with its mate, Troi and her shipmates managed to pass a test of Humanity's intentions imposed on them by Q. (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint")

Soon after, Troi was affected by polywater intoxication that caused her and the majority of the Enterprise's crew to act out of character, but she was quickly taken to sickbay and provided with medical treatment. (TNG: "The Naked Now") Her empathic abilities were also useful a short time later, when she assisted in uncovering the intentions of Ligonian leader Lutan after he kidnapped security chief Natasha Yar. (TNG: "Code of Honor")

Later that year, the Enterprise traveled to Haven, a legendarily beautiful planet near Beta Cassius. The planet was also the location of Wyatt Miller, who was scheduled to marry Troi as a result of their genetic bonding. Having expected that the marriage would not take place due to the years-long distance from her homeworld that serving aboard the Enterprise would cause, Deanna initially did not inform her crewmates of her obligation. Nevertheless, she agreed to honor her vows taken years earlier, even though she had since become doubtful of them and would need to leave the ship with her new husband once they had been married. While Deanna's mother, Lwaxana, and both Wyatt Miller's parents were aboard the Enterprise, a social gathering known as a pre-joining announcement was held to celebrate the forthcoming wedding. The marriage itself was permanently canceled, however, when Wyatt, a doctor by profession, chose to join his fantasy lover (a real woman he had had frequent dreams about) aboard an infected Tarellian vessel. (TNG: "Haven")

When a planet in the Delphi Ardu system drained the Enterprise of its power, Troi and the majority of the ship's crew suffered from exposure to extreme cold and were forced to endure almost deadly oxygen deprivation. (TNG: "The Last Outpost")

Upon first contact with the Ferengi species in 2364, Troi reported that she could discern neither thoughts nor emotions from them, giving her the initial impression that they could shield those from others. She later mentioned, however, that she could sense one of the Ferengi was hiding something. (TNG: "The Last Outpost")

Troi in late 2364
Troi was unable to detect any feelings from the Traveler when he was encountered by the Enterprise's crew in the same year. (TNG: "Where No One Has Gone Before") However, she was later instrumental in discovering that an alien force had been invading the minds of crewmembers aboard the Enterprise and was influencing Captain Picard, who later temporarily blinded Troi while he was under the alien's influence. After Picard beamed himself and the alien into space, the crew believed that he could not be recovered, but Troi sensed that the captain had separated from the alien influence. Thanks to her advice, Picard was ultimately returned safely to the ship. (TNG: "Lonely Among Us")

While searching for survivors from the doomed Federation freighter Odin, the Enterprise journeyed to the planet Angel I, becoming the first Federation vessel to visit the planet in sixty-two years. As Angel I was home to a female-dominated society, Troi, who commented early in the visit that a description of the planet made her suspect the location would be very much like her own homeworld, gratefully accepted the offer to make initial contact with Angels I's inhabitants and managed to arrange a meeting with a reticent head of the planet's government. (TNG: "Angel One")

Later that year, Troi was returning from a conference when her shuttle suffered a sudden instrument malfunction and subsequently crash landed on Vagra II. There, a lonely but sadistic entity that referred to itself as Armus held Troi prisoner by surrounding her shuttle with a force field and prevented her crewmates from rescuing her, even going so far as to kill Lieutenant Yar. Troi and her shuttle pilot, Lieutenant Ben Prieto, were eventually rescued after Wesley Crusher and Worf discovered that the field weakened when Armus was provoked, due in part to Troi's intelligence regarding Armus' emotional state and psychology. (TNG: "Skin of Evil")

Troi in 2365
Near the end of her first year aboard the Enterprise, Troi was looking forward to a moonlight swim on the ship's oceanic destination of Pacifica, an experience she believed could not adequately be replicated by the ship's holodeck. She did not get the opportunity to enjoy her swim, however, as the Enterprise was diverted to Dytallix B and then to Earth. (TNG: "Conspiracy") Deanna later helped Clare Raymond, a recently revived Human from the late 20th century, learn about her descendants and locate distant relation Thomas Raymond. (TNG: "The Neutral Zone")

In early 2365, Troi became pregnant by an alien who wished to experience Human feelings and relationships. He grew at an accelerated rate and within hours was an eight-year-old boy. At the same time, a plasmic plague struck the ship and threatened to kill everyone within hours. The alien realized that he was the source of the plague and sacrificed his Human life to save the ship, reverting to his alien form and then leaving the craft. Troi experienced both the joy of childbirth and the heartbreak of losing a child. (TNG: "The Child")

Later that year, when Ira Graves downloaded his memories into Data, Troi discovered that the changes in Data's personality were actually Graves. (TNG: "The Schizoid Man")

2366-2367
Lieutenant Commander Troi in 2367
The next year, Troi fell for a delegate, Devinoni Ral, at a conference for the rights to a wormhole. Troi and Ral had an instant attraction to each other. She learned that he was part Betazoid and had been using his mental powers to influence the negotiations. When the Ferengi threatened to blow up the wormhole, stating that there was a secret deal between the Federation and the Barzan, Troi suspected that this was staged by Ral to acquire the rights to the wormhole. The Barzan gave the rights to Ral, but it was soon discovered that the wormhole was unstable and worthless. Ral quickly left and bade goodbye to Troi. (TNG: "The Price")

Troi thereafter met her former patient Tam Elbrun again, when he was being transported by the Enterprise on an ultimately successful mission in which Elbrun made first contact with and subsequently remained with an alien lifeform that looked like an organic spaceship and was called "Tin Man". (TNG: "Tin Man")

Troi losing her telepathic abilities
Troi became the object of affection for a new crewmember named Reginald Barclay. He was too shy to approach her, so he created a holoprogram to interact with her. Troi counseled him, and he eventually ended the program. (TNG: "Hollow Pursuits")

While attending a trade conference on Betazed, Deanna, along with Lwaxana and Riker, were captured by the Ferengi, who wanted to use Lwaxana's telepathic abilities to give them an advantage in negotiations. They used mind probes on Deanna and Lwaxana, but Riker was able to send a message to the Enterprise, communicating the location of the Ferengi ship, and they were then rescued. (TNG: "Ménage à Troi")

Troi temporarily lost her powers when she came in contact with two-dimensional lifeforms that had caught the Enterprise in their magnetic force. They were heading for a cosmic string which would destroy the Enterprise. Picard asked her to use her Human abilities to try to determine the aliens' intentions – as he pointed out, her degrees in psychology were not tied to her powers and she was still the most qualified person on the ship for the task. Troi determined that the cosmic string was their home; the Enterprise was able to break free, and after the aliens left, her powers returned. (TNG: "The Loss")

While investigating the USS Brattain, which had become stranded in space, the Enterprise found one crewmember alive, a Betazoid science adviser. The rest of the crew had killed each other. The Enterprise crew discovered that the ship was caught in Tyken's Rift, which sapped all the energy from the ship. Additionally, the crew of the Brattain had succumbed to madness through sleep deprivation from an unknown cause. The same thing was happening to the Enterprise. The crew was on the verge of madness, and only Data and Troi were unaffected, as Data did not require sleep and Troi's partially Betazoid physiology processed dreams at a different frequency. Data believed that an explosion would get them out of the rift, but the plan failed. Troi had experienced a single, recurring nightmare, but determined that it was an act of communication from other beings stuck on the other side of the rift. This communication had caused the dream states of the rest of the crew to become disrupted. In a dream state, she relayed a plan of cooperation that would release each ship. Her plan worked. (TNG: "Night Terrors")

2368-2369
Troi took command of the Enterprise after it was hit by a quantum filament that caused major damage and trapped the officers in various parts of the ship. She decided not to separate the bridge and engineering, and to divert power to engineering, a decision that ended up saving the ship. (TNG: "Disaster")

Troi counseled Worf and Alexander Rozhenko, who had boarded the ship to stay with his father. Her efforts helped stabilize their relationship. Whereas Worf was about to send his son to a Klingon school, Troi observed that the boy was difficult because of the death of his mother, leaving him with a feeling of abandonment, and that sending him away would only make the boy worse. (TNG: "New Ground")

During a visit by telepathic aliens, Troi was attacked and lapsed into a coma. On waking, she believed she had been attacked by Riker. She ultimately discovered, though, that one of the aliens, who had participated in the attack, had been using his telepathic powers to make her think her attacker had been someone else than he himself. (TNG: "Violations")

While helping to save a closed society of genetically-engineered Earth colonists, Troi became romantically involved with their leader, Aaron Conor. After the colony was saved, the romance ended as she returned to the ship and he declined to leave his colony. (TNG: "The Masterpiece Society")

Troi's body was taken over by an alien spirit after the Enterprise investigated the disappearance of the USS Essex, an event that had occurred almost two hundred years previously. Troi, along with O'Brien and Data, was possessed and hijacked the Enterprise, taking hostages in the process. The Troi alien stated that he was Bryce Shumar, captain of the Essex, and that he and his crew's spirits had been caught up in the magnetic field of the moon. He asked that their bones, which were on the planet, be returned to Earth, so that their spirits could rest. Picard did not believe "Troi", and found out that she wished to return to the planet to get the other alien spirits, so they could take over the crew's bodies. The moon was actually a penal colony, and the spirits were really criminals. After Picard threatened to destroy the Enterprise and their existences, the spirits decided to stay alive on their moon. (TNG: "Power Play")

After Lwaxana boarded the Enterprise and announced that she planned to marry (again), Troi's attempts to counsel Alexander, Worf's son, about meeting his responsibilities were disrupted by her mother. Deanna also became upset that her mother was not going to follow the traditional Betazed marriage rituals. In reality, Lwaxana was suffering a mid-life crisis, and in the end, she terminated her relationship with her suitor. (TNG: "Cost of Living")

Troi as a victim of rapid aging induced by Ves Alkar
In 2369, Troi met Ves Alkar, a Federation mediator who routinely transferred, telepathically, his dark thoughts and emotions to other hosts, so that his mind was clear and able to mediate conflicts more effectively. After Alkar's previous receptacle expired, Troi was tricked by him into performing a "funeral meditation", which established a link – deliberate on Alkar's part – between them. The effect of this transfer caused Troi to act aggressively and, due to the fact she was a non-Lumerian, to experience rapid aging faster than his previous victims. Before Alkar left for a conference, Troi attempted to use a knife but Picard stopped her. After that, Troi was taken to sickbay by Riker, who was the first to know something was wrong due to knowing her better then anyone, and two security guards so Dr. Crusher can help her. When Alkar refuses to release Troi, Dr. Crusher induced death-like symptoms, to trick Alkar into severing the link by trying to take another female Lumerian as his receptacle, at which point Troi was revived by Crusher and the Enterprise crew thwarted Alkar. (TNG: "Man of the People")

Troi later participated in an Old West holodeck program with Worf and Alexander. It became too real when a malfunction released the safety protocols as a result of Data interfacing with the Enterprise's computers, causing the characters to take on the android's appearance and abilities. Troi helped Worf rescue Alexander and put the outlaws in jail. (TNG: "A Fistful of Datas")

Troi as Major Rakal in 2369
Later in 2369, Troi was kidnapped and surgically altered by the Romulan underground movement. She was forced to assume the role of Major Rakal, an operative for the Tal Shiar, aboard the IRW Khazara. While there, Troi befriended Sub-Commander N'Vek, who helped her to adopt her role and also revealed the true nature of her mission – to help Vice-Proconsul M'ret and two of his aides defect to the Federation. Troi discovered that she wielded much power over the crew of the Khazara, as many people were frightened of the Tal Shiar. However, she had a conflicted relationship with the Khazara's commanding officer, Commander Toreth. When Troi's mission took a turn for the worse and a fight with the Enterprise seemed imminent, Deanna seized command of the Khazara. She managed to successfully complete her mission by concealing a transporter beam inside a low-level disruptor blast. N'Vek was killed by the Khazara's helmsman after Toreth retook command, and the Enterprise barely managed to beam Deanna back on board before the Khazara fled under cloak. (TNG: "Face of the Enemy")

Troi, along with Picard, Data, and Geordi La Forge, returned from a conference to find the Enterprise and a Romulan ship suspended in time, a condition caused by aliens who were using the warp core as an incubation for their young. While helping to investigate the situation, Troi demonstrated her knowledge of Romulan engineering principles, acquired during her time aboard the Khazara. She and her companions drove out the aliens, after which the timeline was restored. (TNG: "Timescape")

At the end of the year, Troi, together with Picard and La Forge, was captured and imprisoned by Lore, who planned to lead a group of individualized Borg drones to destroy the Federation and had brainwashed Data into helping him. Troi and her inmates stole a transceiver that they used to restore Data's ethics. The prisoners were finally rescued by Hugh, Data, and the Enterprise. (TNG: "Descent", "Descent, Part II")

2370-2371
Lieutenant Commander Troi in 2370
Troi promoted to full commander
When the Enterprise took part in a cultural exchange in early 2370, Troi served as the liaison for Loquel. She was frustrated by his behavior to the point she felt as though she was going crazy, as all he wanted to do was indulge himself and party. Eventually, she discovered his assignment was to experience pleasure. (TNG: "Liaisons")

Supervised by Riker without any favoritism towards her, Troi tried to pass the Bridge Officer's Test in 2370. She attempted the engineering qualification several times without much luck, after which Riker told her the tests were canceled. However, he also gave her a hint which let her know that the test was really about her ability to send a crew member to his death. Troi went on to successfully pass the test. She was then promoted to the rank of commander and began to include bridge command as part of her duty shifts. With this development, Troi acquired Starfleet status as a line officer, in addition to her previous status as a staff officer. (TNG: "Thine Own Self")

Troi helped save her mother's life when Lwaxana was suffering a severe mental breakdown due to a long-repressed memory. With the help of a telepathic alien, Deanna managed to enter into her mother's mind and find the source of the mental trauma. She found out she had once had an older sister who had died in a drowning accident that Lwaxana blamed herself for. Deanna was able to help Lwaxana accept the death and convince her that she was not to blame. (TNG: "Dark Page")

After a crewmember, Daniel Kwan, committed suicide on board the Enterprise, Troi was asked to investigate, since the crewman had had empathic abilities and Troi might be able to find out why he had killed himself. After examining Kwan's station, Troi became insanely jealous of Worf; when she found him in the arms of another female crewmate, Troi killed Worf and attempted suicide. She was preparing to jump to her death when Worf, who was actually still alive, saved her. It turned out that everything Troi had experienced had been in her mind. When the Enterprise-D had been under construction, one of the crew, an empath, had committed murder and suicide, leaving an empathic message that had been picked up by Kwan, leading to his death. Troi had picked up the same message, but had been more fortunate. (TNG: "Eye of the Beholder")

Deanna struggles to regain control of the Enterprise
In 2371, Troi piloted the Enterprise-D on the orders of Commander Riker during the Battle of Veridian III. The warp core breach that destroyed the ship's secondary hull knocked the primary hull out of orbit, and she was forced to pilot it to a crash-landing on the planet. Despite her inexperience as a pilot and having to land in rugged terrain, she succeeded in bringing the ship down, saving the crew with minimal casualties. She was the last person to pilot the Enterprise-D, as the saucer section could not be salvaged. (Star Trek Generations)

Aboard the USS Enterprise-E
In 2372, Troi transferred to the Sovereign-class USS Enterprise-E, with most of the senior staff of the Enterprise-D. (Star Trek: First Contact) She continued the occasional role of bridge command as part of her duty shifts, while posted to the Enterprise-E. (Star Trek: Insurrection)

In 2373, Troi and her crewmates disobeyed Starfleet orders by taking part in the Battle of Sector 001. The Enterprise was instrumental in the destruction of an invading Borg cube but pursued a remaining Borg sphere back in time to 2063, subsequently destroying the Borg craft before it could prevent the historic first flight of Zefram Cochrane's Phoenix warp ship.

Troi in 2063, drunkenly toasting a drink with Zefram Cochrane while watched by Commander Riker
After the Borg attack, two teams of officers beamed to the surface of Earth, with Troi serving as a member of the second team. She searched for Zefram Cochrane on the planet and accepted a civilian's offer of a drink in return for information. After three shots of tequila, Troi, having become extremely drunk, discovered that the civilian was actually Zefram Cochrane himself. After she and the inventor were found in a bar by Riker, Troi continued to share a drink of extremely strong tequila with Cochrane, who she officially reported was "nuts", before losing consciousness due to her large consumption of alcohol.

Troi supervising the launch of the Phoenix prototype warp ship
After she came to, Troi helped to convince Cochrane of the importance of his first warp flight, which he was considering canceling following the Borg attack. Troi later supervised the launch of the Phoenix from Earth, Cochrane blasting the song "Magic Carpet Ride" in her ear, a few seconds before launch. By overseeing the launch, she assisted in preserving what followed the historic flight: First Contact between Humans and Vulcans. (Star Trek: First Contact)

Two years later, in 2375, Troi helped Captain Picard prepare to host a reception for a visiting delegation of Evora representatives – after having read a Starfleet report on their species – and later attended the ceremony with Picard, Riker, and Dr. Crusher. Later, Troi alone downloaded all Starfleet records on the Son'a and studied them with Riker. She was also in command of the bridge just before the Enterprise-E arrived at the Briar Patch. Upon encountering members of the Ba'ku – whom the Son'a had been observing until recently – Troi used her empathic abilities to sense that several Ba'ku children present had incredible mental discipline and clarity of perception.

Troi, armed with a phaser rifle on Ba'ku
After it was learned that the Son'a were attempting to discreetly relocate the Ba'ku from their planet, Troi helped to evacuate the Ba'ku from their village to the safety of a mountain range. Around this time, she noticed that her breasts had started to firm up, a result of the age-decelarating properties of metaphasic radiation in the Ba'ku planet's rings. She also helped eliminate Son'a drones, but after Picard and a Ba'ku woman became trapped following a cave-in, her plan to cut away rock using her phaser was discarded, as it was thought to be too dangerous. Once the two imprisoned humanoids were released, Troi stayed with the refugees as most of the other senior officers left to successfully prevent the Son'a from relocating the Ba'ku, who were actually their own distant relations. (Star Trek: Insurrection)

Project Pathfinder
In 2376, Deanna Troi visited Lieutenant Reginald Barclay while she was enjoying shore leave on Earth. Barclay, an old friend of hers from the Enterprise-D and -E, told her about his role in the Pathfinder Project – a mission to determine a method of communicating with the USS Voyager, stranded in the distant Delta Quadrant. Barclay, using a holographic simulation of the starship and its crew, had devised a plan to contact Voyager, but had become obsessed with the starship. Troi feared that he was suffering from a relapse of holo-addiction, a condition he had previously recovered from with her assistance. Although Troi was scheduled to leave Earth aboard the Enterprise the next morning, she decided to ask Captain Picard for a temporary leave of absence, so that she could spend some time with Barclay. Later that night, Barclay left his apartment and headed to Starfleet Command, where he finally managed to establish communication with Voyager. Deanna later shared a drink with Barclay to celebrate his success. (VOY: "Pathfinder")

Troi was serving aboard the Enterprise when Barclay contacted her from Jupiter Station. His friend and the inventor of the Emergency Medical Hologram, Doctor Lewis Zimmerman, was terminally ill on Jupiter Station and was only expected to live a few more months. The officers aboard Voyager had managed to send a member of their crew, a Mark I EMH named simply The Doctor, to Jupiter Station, but Dr. Zimmerman was refusing to be treated by The Doctor, whom he saw as inferior to the later Mark III and Mark IV EMHs.

Attempting to strengthen relations between Voyager's Doctor and his creator, Lewis Zimmerman, in 2376
Barclay suspected that Troi might be able to persuade Zimmerman to allow The Doctor to cure him before he died. Although the Enterprise was in the middle of a mission almost seven light-years away, Troi agreed that the plan sounded like an interesting challenge and requested leave from Captain Picard. A week later, she arrived at Jupiter Station but was unable to mediate an agreement between the two doctors. She and Barclay eventually came up with an alternative strategy: create a malfunction in The Doctor which Zimmerman would have to repair, thereby bringing them closer. It worked according to plan. (VOY: "Life Line")

In 2377, Troi was sunbathing on a beach when Barclay crept up on her. He told her that he had created an advanced interactive hologram in his own image with the express purpose of sending it to Voyager, but the program had gone missing on its way to the starship. Troi helped Barclay and his supervisors at the Pathfinder Project determine that the crew of a Ferengi casino ship had stolen the hologram. Troi and Barclay discovered that the Ferengi had reprogrammed the hologram and sent it to Voyager in an attempt to acquire Borg nanoprobes from Seven of Nine. After the casino ship opened a geodesic fold – a gateway to the Delta Quadrant – Troi suggested sending a warning message to Voyager through the geodesic fold, but Barclay told her that subspace transmissions could not pass through the anomaly.

Instead, Barclay contacted the casino ship from the Voyager simulation at Starfleet Command while Troi stood next to him and watched from outside the Ferengi's view. Pretending to be his hologram, Barclay told the Ferengi that Captain Janeway had discovered their plan and was furiously preparing to attack with powerful weaponry. The Ferengi believed the trick and closed the geodesic fold. Shortly before Deanna left San Francisco, Barclay was working on programming another version of his hologram with security protocols so it couldn't be stolen again. She convinced him to get out of the office and start experiencing life again, namely by going out on a double-date with herself and Riker, and Riker's friend, a teacher named Maril they wanted to introduce to him. (VOY: "Inside Man")

Marriage and transfer
Wedding ceremony in Alaska
Will Riker and Deanna married in 2379, shortly before their transfer to the USS Titan. Their wedding party in Alaska included Captain Picard as best man, Dr. Crusher as bridesmaid, and Data, La Forge, Worf, and Wesley Crusher as groomsmen. Guinan was also present. Another ceremony, a traditional Betazoid wedding, was planned on Betazed shortly following. However, that ceremony was delayed when the Enterprise was diverted to Romulus. (Star Trek Nemesis)

Troi guides Worf in targeting the Scimitar
In 2379, Troi made her final voyage aboard the Enterprise as the ship journeyed to Romulan space on a diplomatic mission in which she and her crewmates met new Reman Praetor Shinzon. Aboard the Enterprise, Troi was telepathically violated by Shinzon, who seemed obsessed by her. She used their residual link to her advantage, however, during the Battle in the Bassen Rift; after the Enterprise was nearly disabled, Troi took the helm and, under Captain Picard's orders, crashed the ship into Shinzon's Reman warbird, the Scimitar, further disabling that craft. Troi was later saddened to learn that the fatalities of the battle had included not only Shinzon but also Data. She subsequently joined the USS Titan under Riker's command, and was due to return to Romulus on another diplomatic mission. (Star Trek Nemesis)

Aboard the USS Titan

In 2380, Troi was on the Titan, when that ship saved the USS Cerritos when it was attacked by the Pakleds. (LD: "No Small Parts")

About a year later, Troi would give birth to her and Riker's first child, Thaddeus Troi-Riker. (PIC: "Nepenthe")

Life after Starfleet
Troi and Riker, along with their two children, Thaddeus Troi-Riker and Kestra Troi-Riker, settled on the planet Nepenthe in an effort to mitigate Thaddeus' Mendaxic neurosclerosis. Unfortunately, the disease proved fatal, and Thaddeus died. He would have survived had the Federation not imposed a ban on synthetic lifeforms after the 2385 attack on Mars. (PIC: "Maps and Legends", "Nepenthe")

Retired Admiral Jean-Luc Picard arrived on Nepenthe in 2399 with Soji Asha, whom Troi could not sense any emotion from, and Riker immediately recognized as being an android descended from Data. As Picard had expected, Riker and Troi both offered to help him without hesitation, opening their home to him and Soji for as long as they needed. (PIC: "Nepenthe")

Personal interests
Exercise
Deanna enjoyed swimming, but didn't think swimming on the holodeck was an adequate substitute for swimming in a real ocean. (TNG: "Conspiracy") She often used exercise programs on the holodeck, though, when she needed to take her mind off frustrations. (TNG: "The Emissary")

Troi and Beverly Crusher often exercised together. (TNG: "The Price") With Crusher, Troi also took mok'bara classes. (TNG: "Second Chances", "Masks", "Sub Rosa")

Chocolate
Deanna once said that she had never met a form of chocolate that she did not like. (TNG: "The Game") Data mentioned to Q that, when Counselor Troi was in a bad mood, she often ordered a food containing chocolate. (TNG: "Deja Q") Dr. Crusher once described Counselor Troi as loving chocolate. (TNG: "Remember Me")

Poker
Aboard the Enterprise-D, Troi enjoyed playing poker with her crewmates. She was not known to bluff, according to Worf, but was quick to point out that perhaps she was good enough that he simply never caught her. (TNG: "Eye of the Beholder")

Music
Troi once idly played a melody on a piano on Moab IV. (TNG: "The Masterpiece Society")

Personal relationships
Friendships
Beverly Crusher
Deanna Troi and Beverly Crusher became very good friends. They often worked out together and took mok'bara classes, taught by Worf. (TNG: "The Price", "Second Chances", "Sub Rosa", "Masks")

Deanna and Beverly often advised each other on romantic relationships. At one point, Deanna worried that her romance with Devinoni Ral was proceeding too fast, but Beverly assured her that perhaps she did not need to be rational regarding a whirlwind romance. (TNG: "The Price")

While Crusher was using the salon aboard the Enterprise-D, Troi arrived there and was surprised to find Beverly using the salon at the same time, as Crusher rarely visited the salon. Recognizing romantic feelings Crusher had about Trill Ambassador Odan, Troi happily admitted to Beverly this detection of romance, even though Beverly and her paramour were trying to keep their relationship a secret. However, Troi also sensed the dual nature of the ambassador, and warned Beverly to be cautious. Later, when the Odan host was implanted in Will Riker's body, Deanna counseled Beverly, in a discussion they had in Ten Forward, on the mixed feelings Crusher then felt towards Odan and Riker. Although Beverly wished she had never met Odan, Deanna advised Beverly not to wish such a thing and mused that to love was impossible without risking pain. Troi encouraged Beverly to accept Odan's love if she still felt it while he was in Riker's body. (TNG: "The Host")

When time-traveler Berlinghoff Rasmussen came aboard the ship, Troi didn't trust him and told Crusher about her feelings of suspicion. (TNG: "A Matter of Time")

After the Enterprise rescued transporter duplicate Thomas Riker from a research station on Nervala IV in 2369, the possibility of Troi entering a romantic relationship with him came up, since Tom Riker – as a duplicate of Will Riker – had memories of having had a relationship with Deanna and was interested in pursuing a romance with her. Troi and Crusher chatted about a date with Tom during a workout, where Crusher mischievously pointed out that Troi should not be afraid to try a relationship with the duplicate Riker. When Tom Riker entered the gym and Beverly then decided to leave the two alone, Troi was initially shocked by Crusher's departure, but it led to Deanna becoming intimate with Tom. (TNG: "Second Chances")

Deanna accompanied Beverly to Felisa Howard's funeral in 2370 and back to Felisa's home following the services. She counseled Beverly about erotic dreams Crusher had experienced after reading her grandmother's journals, dreams which were due to the influence of Ronin. After Beverly met Ronin on Caldos, Deanna reminded her that her feelings of romance might simply be due to shared trauma, but Beverly brushed off her concern. (TNG: "Sub Rosa")

Reginald Barclay
"I feel your confidence"
Troi's relationship with Reginald Barclay did not start off very well. Because he was intimidated not only by Troi's beauty but by her status as ship's counselor, he even went as far as to meet with a holographic version of her rather than with the real Troi. In Barclay's holoprogram of The Three Musketeers with the senior staff serving the primary roles, Troi told Riker and La Forge that there was nothing wrong with a healthy fantasy life, until she found her likeness was the Goddess of Empathy. After this incident, she began a real-world counseling relationship with Barclay, including helping him through his bout of transporter phobia. (TNG: "Hollow Pursuits", "Realm of Fear") This counseling relationship eventually turned into friendship, and Barclay called upon her to help him when he was assigned to the Pathfinder Project. (VOY: "Pathfinder")

Natasha Yar
Troi was tearfully angry when Lieutenant Yar was frozen by Q during a trial ceremony at which he acted as judge, and she furiously shouted, "You barbarian!" at Q. (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint")

While Yar was infected with polywater intoxication later that year, Troi was startled to find Yar in her quarters, Yar having sought Troi for advice regarding her hair and clothes. Even though the lieutenant seemed playfully content, Troi sensed that she was actually very uncertain and was fighting something. Concerned for her crewmate and friend, Deanna asked Yar what was wrong and, after the lieutenant left without answering the question, immediately reported her strange behavior to Captain Picard. Unknown to Troi at the time, however, she herself had contracted the polywater intoxication from Yar during their brief encounter. (TNG: "The Naked Now")

After Yar was kidnapped by Ligonian leader Lutan, Troi helped uncover the intentions of her friend's captor, remarking at one point that she believed Yar was physically very attractive. After Lutan announced his decision to make Yar his First One, Deanna tricked the lieutenant into admitting, in the presence of Captain Picard, that she had felt good when Lutan had said he wanted her. Troi's deceit shocked Yar, as she regarded Deanna as a friend, but the counselor explained that she had used deception only so that Yar would answer honestly how she felt about Lutan. Troi later argued in favor of Yar's partaking in a fight to the death against a challenger to her entitlement, advising Picard that the lieutenant would easily be able to beat her opponent – Lutan's current First One, Yareena. (TNG: "Code of Honor")

Family
Lwaxana Troi
With Lwaxana in 2364
Deanna had a tense relationship with her mother and was often visibly irritated when Lwaxana showed up on the USS Enterprise-D unannounced. Also, Deanna was often not as concerned about her own love life as her mother was. (TNG: "Haven", "Ménage à Troi")


Ian Andrew Troi
Deanna was devasted by her father's death, Ian Troi, who suddenly died in 2343, when Deanna was around seven years old. She remembered him fondly, years later. When she became pregnant by an alien energy being, Deanna named the resulting child after her father. (TNG: "Half a Life", "The Child")

Kestra Troi
Deanna Troi was a baby at the time her older sister, Kestra Troi, died during a family picnic they went on with their parents. Since Lwaxana buried the memory instead of dealing with the loss, Deanna did not know anything of Kestra Troi until 2370. (TNG: "Dark Page")

Alexander Rozhenko
When Worf's son Alexander came to live with him on the Enterprise, Troi played a significant role in helping Alexander define and develop a relationship with his father, as well as assisting Worf's bond with his son. When Worf was severely injured in 2368, Deanna was requested, by Worf, to look after Alexander if Worf died; as Worf saw it, she was the best person to care for his son. (TNG: "Ethics") Deanna's affection for Alexander was reciprocated, as Alexander came to trust Troi and developed a great affection for her, and an even greater affection for her mother, Lwaxana. (TNG: "Cost of Living") In late 2370, Deanna gladly accepted a request from Worf that she formally become Alexander's soh-chim, an honorary role equivalent to that of a godmother. (TNG: "Parallels")

Romance
William T. Riker
Troi kissing Riker on Betazed
Deanna had an extremely close relationship with Will Riker, occasionally referring to him as imzadi, a Betazoid word for "beloved". Before they served together on the Enterprise-D, Troi taught Riker how to read her thoughts when she telepathically projected them. They learned each other's abilities but couldn't say "goodbye" when they parted.

After Troi was assigned to the Enterprise-D in 2364, she was reunited with Riker. Although they informed Captain Picard that they already knew each other, neither Riker nor Troi initially revealed the intimate nature of their former relationship. Troi seemed fairly eager to be alone with Riker, and while at Deneb IV's mysterious Farpoint Station, she suggested that they explore a network of passages below the station together, an idea that Riker refused. Before he later endangered his own life to investigate why a space vessel lifeform believed to be a ship was attacking Deneb IV, Troi expressed, in an outburst of emotion, her extreme fear that Riker could be hurt. She soon managed to resume her former sense of calm, however, and returned to the Enterprise, as Riker had ordered. (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint")

During the Enterprise's subsequent missions, Troi referred to Riker as "Bill" on at least two occasions. (TNG: "The Naked Now", "Haven")

While under the influence of polywater intoxication, Troi was drawn to Riker, and in an attempt to seduce her former lover, she sensuously embraced him in main engineering. When he picked her up in his arms and began carrying her to sickbay, she asked if he wouldn't rather be alone with her in his mind than ensuring she was hospitalized. Riker, however, did not surrender to her seduction and succeeded in taking her to sickbay. (TNG: "The Naked Now")

Troi and Riker were later asked by Captain Picard to exhibit use of the Enterprise's holodecks to a party of Ligonian representatives, while the group of Ligonians were negotiating with the ship's crew upon visiting the vessel. When Ligonian leader Lutan instead requested that Lieutenant Yar demonstrate defense training in one of the holodecks, Picard's request went unanswered and Troi lost the opportunity to work solely with Riker. (TNG: "Code of Honor")

Troi's life, as well as the lives of virtually the entire crew of the Enterprise, was later saved by Riker when he managed to persuade Portal 63 of the long-extinct Tkon Empire to release the starship from his control, as the Portal had trapped the Enterprise in an energy field that was draining the ship's power and forcing its crew, including Troi, to endure extreme cold and almost deadly oxygen deprivation. (TNG: "The Last Outpost")

Deanna and Will Riker get intimate with each other again in 2375
During the Enterprise-E's mission to Ba'ku in 2375, Deanna and Will were affected by the metaphasic radiation of the planet's rings, which eventually led to their reviving their relationship. (Star Trek: Insurrection) Deanna and Will Riker married four years later. (Star Trek Nemesis) 

They settled on the planet Nepenthe with their two children, Thaddeus Troi-Riker and Kestra Troi-Riker. Thaddeus died of Mendaxic neurosclerosis, which could have been cured with a positronic matrix had the Federation not imposed a ban on synthetic lifeforms after the 2385 Attack on Mars. (PIC: "Nepenthe")

Worf
Deanna shares a romantic moment with Worf in 2370
Although Worf was distrustful and uneasy around telepaths, Troi became a trusted exception. There was some early antagonism between them, especially when he insisted that her unexpected pregnancy (with Ian) had to be aborted for the safety of the ship. But she later helped him adjust to his new role as a father to his son, Alexander, at which time Worf grew to trust and respect Troi. (TNG: "New Ground", "Ethics", "Parallels")

After an encounter with alternate realities showed him a life with Troi as his wife, Worf's eyes were opened to a new possibility, and he began to pursue her. Though surprised, Troi welcomed the advances, and the two enjoyed a romantic relationship through 2370. Deanna wasn't thrilled by Worf's concern about Riker's interest in the matter, but the triangle's tension was eased by the advice of Captain Picard. (TNG: "Parallels", "Eye of the Beholder", "All Good Things...")
