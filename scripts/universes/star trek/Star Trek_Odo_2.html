<html><p>They were stuck in the turbolift so long that Odo could barely hold his shape and was literally "melting." Lwaxana offered to carry Odo in her dress, but he was embarrassed and worried, as no one had ever seen him in his liquid form. He was worried that if someone saw him like that, they would be repulsed because he was so different from them. To make him feel understood, Lwaxana removed her wig and admitted that no one had ever seen her in her natural state either. Odo felt more at ease after this revelation and allowed Lwaxana to carry him. Their interaction had a profound effect on Odo, giving him more confidence in who he was. (DS9: "The Forsaken", "The Muse")

During Ambassador Troi's next visit to DS9, her persistent feelings for Odo combined with a case of zanthi fever caused people in close proximity to her to desire others: Jake Sisko and Doctor Bashir both became infatuated with Kira, for example, Jadzia Dax with Sisko, and Vedek Bareil with Dax. (DS9: "Fascination")

Lwaxana's final visit with Odo was when she fled her Tavnian husband, Jeyal, who was intent on taking her unborn child when it was born. In Tavnian culture, boys and girls were raised under strict gender separation, something Lwaxana's husband had initially promised would not be the case for their child (he later declared his intention to take her male child as soon as it was born, disregarding his previous assurances to her). Lwaxana had married Jeyal in response to being rejected by Odo and having her heart broken. She had come to Odo for protection from her husband and Odo came up with the plan to marry Lwaxana in Tavnian tradition in order to end the biological father's legal claim to their offspring under Tavnian law (which specified the mother's husband as the legal guardian for male children). This required a public profession of his love for her, which needed to be believable. While Odo wasn't romantically attracted to Lwaxana, his profession of love for her was genuine, revealing the depth of appreciation he had for her and their friendship. Reflecting on their relationship since their time stuck in the turbolift a few years before, he said, "Before I met her ... I was ashamed of what I was, afraid that if people saw how truly different I was they would recoil from me. Lwaxana saw how different I was and she didn't recoil. She wanted to see more. For the first time in my life, someone wanted me as I was. And that changed me forever. The day I met her, is the day I stopped being alone. And I want her to be part of my life from this day on." The plan was successful and Lwaxana was free from Jeyal. Odo wanted her to stay on DS9 following their marriage but Lwaxana knew Odo's love for her wasn't romantic and she would come to resent him for not reciprocating her love. Their friendship was too precious, she said, to allow that to happen. (DS9: "The Muse")

Arissa
Odo talking to Arissa
An Idanian woman named Arissa once fell for Odo while he was protecting her from the group who were trying to kill her, the two even spending the night together (a first for Odo, outside of a single pseudo-sexual encounter during his brief time on the Founder homeworld). Later, he found out that she was an agent sent into deep cover to infiltrate the Orion Syndicate. She was married and, due to her mind having been altered to escape telepathic examination, she did not know this while she was undercover. As she departed to return to her former life, she assured Odo that she had genuinely loved him in their time together and in a way still did. (DS9: "A Simple Investigation")

Female Changeling
When Odo first visited the home of his people the Changeling representing them took the form of a female humanoid. The two linked together in a way that might be considered sexual. (DS9: "A Simple Investigation") Later, during the Dominion's occupation of Deep Space 9, Odo became involved with the Female Changeling. Initially, his only intent was to learn more about his own people and perhaps influence her towards a peaceful resolution of the current conflict. However, she was able to manipulate him and his desire for control over his own emotions regarding Kira. Eventually she was able to almost completely turn Odo away from his former friends and allies, but the revelation that she intended "to break" the Alpha Quadrant peoples of their desire for freedom shocked him into reconsidering his new "perspective". He effectively ended their personal relationship by siding once again with the Federation against the Dominion. (DS9: "Sacrifice of Angels") Later, at the end of the war, he was able to save her life from the morphogenic virus and convince her to give the stand-down order to the remaining Dominion forces by promising to return to the Great Link with the cure. (DS9: "What You Leave Behind")

Alternate realities and timelines
A version of Odo from an alternate timeline
In an alternate timeline in which Harry Kim was never assigned to the USS Voyager, Odo arrested Tom Paris in 2371, after Paris attacked Quark in Quark's bar. Odo's actions during this incident resulted in Paris still sitting in a holding cell on DS9 when Voyager was thrown into the Delta Quadrant. Odo was later mentioned by Paris, in conversation with Kim, at which point Paris described him as "a very unpleasant shapeshifter." (VOY: "Non Sequitur")

In an alternate timeline in which the Defiant was sent back in time to the 22nd century, Odo was the only member of the crew (besides Dax) who lived to see the Defiant arriving in the 24th century. In two hundred years, he had grown more proficient in shapeshifting and was able to assume a more humanoid face. Odo, during the Defiant's visit in the 24th century, admitted his romantic feelings to Kira, and subsequently linked with his younger self. He sabotaged the Defiant and caused it to avoid crashing on Gaia, wishing to give his younger self and Kira a second chance at love. By doing so, the inhabitants of Gaia ceased to exist. (DS9: "Children of Time")

Holograms

"Oh, another glorious chapter in Klingon history. Tell me, do they still sing songs of the Great Tribble Hunt?"


"Come on, Quark, move it along. You should be in the emergency shelter by now."

Appendices
Background information
Odo was played by Rene Auberjonois throughout the entire run of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Odo has also been played by Salome Jens (when he took the form of the Female Changeling in "Tacking Into the Wind" to infiltrate a Jem'Hadar ship), several unnamed animals (including rats, birds, and a German Shepherd), and various inanimate objects.

As Michael Piller explains, "we needed a character who represented the traditions of Spock and Data, the outsider who looks in at humanity." (New Frontiers: The Story of Deep Space Nine, DS9 Season 2 DVD, Special Features) He described Odo as "the curmudgeon of all curmudgeons. So instead of Data who worships humanity and wants to be that, and Spock who would deny it, Odo has been forced to pass as a humanoid all of his life, to look like us and act like us because it's a lot more socially acceptable and he resents it. So he has now found a way to use it as a defense mechanism and keep a distance from it and find ways to be critical of the human condition." (Trek: Deep Space Nine: The Unauthorized Story, p. 10)

Concept art for "a much more muscular, intimidating lawman" version of Odo" (Star Trek: The Magazine, Issue 5, p. 22)
The original 1992 Writers' Bible for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine[2] gave this biography for Odo:

Odo, an alien male, middle-aged curmudgeon, and a shape-shifter. In his natural state he is a gelatinous liquid. He was Bajoran law enforcement officer on the space station under the Cardassians. Starfleet decides to have him continue in that role, since he's extremely savvy about the Promenade and all who frequent it. His back story is: 50 years ago, with no memory of his past, he was found alone in a mysterious space craft that appeared in the Denarias asteroid belt. He was found by the Bajoran and lived amongst them. At first he was sort of an Elephant Man, a source of curiosity and humor as he turned himself into a chair or pencil. Finally he realized he would have to take the form of a humanoid to assimilate and function in their environment. He does it, but resents it. As a result, Odo performs a uniquely important role in the ensemble: he is a character who explores and comments on Human values. Because he is forced to pass as one of us, his point of view usually comes with a cynical and critical edge. But he can't quite get it right, this humanoid shape, though he continues to try. So he looks a little unfinished in a way. He's been working on it a long time. Someone might ask him: Why dont you take the form of a younger man. His answer: I would if I could. He has the adopted child syndrome, searching for his own personal identity. Although he doesn't know anything about his species, he is certain that justice is an integral part of their being, because the necessity for it runs through every fiber of his body â€“ a racial memory. Thats why he became a law man. He has a couple of Bajoran deputies; he doesnt allow weapons on the Promenade, and once every day he must return to his gelatinous form.

According to Rene Auberjonois, "Constable Odo was envisioned originally as a kind of young John Wayne sheriff-in-town." Similarly, Ira Steven Behr stated, "I was told six months before the series began that Odo was going to be a Clint Eastwood type, and when we started creating the first couple of episodes, we sent writers off to write Clint Eastwood. And then I was told Rene Auberjonois. And I said, 'Clint Eastwood, Rene Auberjonois? Clint Eastwood, Rene Auberjonois? Does not compute.' And then I saw what he brought to the role, and I had to call up a whole bunch of writers and say 'Guys, I apologize, but this is better than we even imagined.'" (Crew Dossier: Odo, DS9 Season 3 DVD special features)

Although Rene Auberjonois himself was initially unsure as to whether or not he could play the role, his daughter had no such doubts: "When the script was first sent to me and I read the description of the character, my daughter said to me, 'Oh dad, yeah, this is yours, you're gonna get this.' My kids were completely confident that this part was for me, which, considering the nature of the character, I don't know if I should take that as a compliment or not." (Hidden File 04, DS9 Season 1 DVD special features)

Auberjonois was not allowed to eat or chew gum while filming, for fear it would ruin the make-up, although Salome Jens managed to get away with chewing gum on the set. Subsequently, Auberjonois said that "now I chew gum as a tribute to Odo." [3]

The name "Odo" is shared with a central character in Ursula Le Guin's 1974 novel The Dispossessed. The character, ironically and in contrast to the Odo of Deep Space Nine, is an anarchist. Michael Piller originally called the character "Otto", but Rick Berman changed it to "Odo". (New Frontiers: The Story of Deep Space Nine, DS9 Season 2 DVD special features)

Odo's relationship with Quark is a clear homage to the classic 1942 Michael Curtiz film Casablanca, with Odo in Claude Rains' role of Captain Louis Renault and Quark as Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine, although the garrulous Renault and taciturn Blaine are somewhat the opposite in personality to their counterparts. At one point Quark notes, "Everybody comes to Quark's," a nod to the title of the play on which Casablanca is based (Everybody Comes to Rick's by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison), while, in "The Ascent", he asks, "Do you think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship?" a twist on the film's closing line.

Several scripts refer to Odo's superior strength, such as "Vortex", [4] and his lack of a sense of smell. (DS9: "If Wishes Were Horses")

Mary Chieffo once remarked, "Of course, I have a soft spot for Odo." [5]

Apocrypha
In the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - Millennium series of novels, it was revealed that Odo rarely shifted into smaller forms such as insects due to a psychological block from his original "training" under Doctor Mora; Mora once speculated that Odo's excess mass during small transformations was transferred to a pocket dimension, and Odo initially worried that something might happen to his mass if he maintained a small shape for long. The same novel series also speculates that the Founders placed a mental block on Odo's abilities to make it difficult for him to alter his face, thus explaining why he can never get faces quite right, even after linking with other Changelings on several occasions.

In the DS9 Relaunch novels, Odo sent a Jem'Hadar ambassador to the Alpha Quadrant to foster understanding in the Dominion of other cultures. He soon returned to DS9 and reunited with Kira.

Odo later learned that the Hundred were initially sent out to find the Progenitor â€“ the first Changeling and the key to solving their declining population, as Changelings could not reproduce (Odo and the other Hundred were not "infants", but merely Changelings that had never been part of the Great Link) â€“ but the discovery of the Progenitor's death caused the Changelings to disperse across the quadrant. As of 2382, Odo had only rediscovered approximately thirty Changelings, including himself and Laas, to form a new Link.

According to the Star Trek: Terok Nor novel Night of the Wolves, Odo was found in a spherical module in the Denorios Belt by the Cardassian vessel Kevalu, which was under the command of Dalin Malyn Ocett, in 2345.

In the Star Trek: Typhon Pact novel Raise the Dawn, Odo returned to the Alpha Quadrant to help Sisko investigate reports that the Typhon Pact, an alliance of the Federation's enemies, have stolen Jem'Hadar technology to perfect their own quantum slipstream drive, only to be trapped in the Alpha Quadrant when the wormhole was seemingly destroyed thanks to Kira's attempt to stop a Typhon Pact ship from using it again. Sisko offered Odo a place on his new ship, the USS Robinson, but the novel ends with Odo deciding to remain on Bajor for a time to think about what he will do next.

In Star Trek Online, Odo makes a sudden appearance at the very end of the mission "Scylla and Charybdis" when Dominion ships race in to aid the Alpha Quadrant Alliance in protecting Bajor and the heavily damaged Deep Space 9 from a fleet of Hur'q ships, only cryptically telling the player character "We have to talk." Odo plays a major role in the "Victory is Life" expansion, voiced again by Rene Auberjonois. In the introductory missions for new Jem'Hadar characters, set immediately before "Scylla and Charybdis", Odo instructs his Vorta advisors Weyoun and Loriss to lead his Vanguard Fleet through the wormhole to Bajor. He calls a conference on DS9 and informs the delegates that the Dominion fleet, save for his Vanguard, has all been destroyed by the Hur'q, and calls for the Alpha Quadrant powers to join him in combating the threat. In the course of events in the Gamma Quadrant, Odo admits that he has secretly used transponders to purposely lure the Hur'q to various worlds, including Bajor, to convince the other powers to fight them alongside the Dominion, and reveals that he has been kept in the dark by the Female Changeling and the rest of the Great Link in regards to their threat. In the mission "Home", Odo personally leads the defense of the Founders' homeworld of Empersa, and later brings the Dominion officially into the Alliance.

Odo of the alternate reality
The alternate reality version of Odo appears in the Star Trek: Ongoing story arc The Q Gambit where he is a member of the Free Federation Resistance after being found by Resistance scientists in 2348. Odo helps Sisko, James T. Kirk, Montgomery Scott, and Nyota Uhura escape from Terok Nor by posing as a Jem'Hadar and are then beamed aboard the USS Defiant where they head for Earth, which had been taken over by the Klingon Empire and renamed "Tera'." When Kurn escorts the group to meet with Chancellor Worf, Odo tells Sisko that something felt amiss to him, and he was right when Worf is suddenly killed by his guards and Kurn, but it is revealed that they're actually Changelings who proclaim Earth is now under Dominion control. One of the Changelings then points his disruptor at Odo saying he would have the honor of dying first for betraying his people, to which Odo said he would commit the betrayal a thousand times over as they have twisted their once peaceful civilization into a mockery of all that is honorable. They are saved when a shuttlecraft piloted by Miles O'Brien arrives and causes the ceiling to crumble killing the Changelings. Odo then explains that he arranged for the shuttle to come pick them up, but couldn't risk telling Sisko in case their enemies found out. When they meet up with Jake Sisko and Jadzia Dax on the Resistance outpost planet Paradise, Sisko becomes host to a Prophet and Odo explains to Uhura who the Prophets are.
