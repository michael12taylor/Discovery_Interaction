Kathryn Janeway was a 24th century Starfleet officer, most noted for her service as captain of the starship USS Voyager. She became the first Federation captain to successfully traverse the Delta Quadrant, encountering dozens of new planets and civilizations over the course of seven years. In fact, by one Admiral's estimation she made first contact with more species than any captain since James T. Kirk. By 2379, she was a vice admiral at Starfleet Command.

Early life
A representation of a young Kathryn Janeway
Kathryn Janeway was born on May 20 in Bloomington, Indiana, on Earth. (VOY: "Year of Hell", "Imperfection") 

Her father was Vice Admiral Janeway and she had one sibling, a sister, who she described as the artist of the family. (VOY: "Sacred Ground", "Coda", "The Killing Game") Her mother was still alive as of 2378. (VOY: "Author, Author")

One of Kathryn's favorite foods, Welsh rarebit, was something she always enjoyed while at her grandfather's. (VOY: "Death Wish") Another was her grandmother's vegetable biryani. (VOY: "Timeless") She grew up on the great plains surrounding her grandfather's farm in Indiana. (VOY: "Macrocosm", "Live Fast and Prosper") With their family having grown up around farmers, her parents insisted that she learn some basic gardening skills. (VOY: "Resolutions")

When she was six years old, she once watched a bolt of lightning split an oak tree in her grandfather's yard, one she had climbed just a few hours before. Many years later, she recalled that there was no anomaly more frightening than a thunderstorm on the plains, especially at such a young age. (VOY: "Fair Haven", "Shattered") Also at the age of six, Kathryn enjoyed an interactive holodeck fairy tale series called The Adventures of Flotter and took ballet lessons, where she learned the dance of "The Dying Swan". She described the dance as being the hit of her "Beginning Ballet" class and recreated the performance in 2373, during Talent Night aboard Voyager. (VOY: "Coda", "Once Upon a Time")

At the age of nine, she and her father hiked the northern rim of the Grand Canyon. She found that "the biggest ditch on Earth" – as her father used to call it – was too dusty for her liking, and Kathryn always preferred farm country. (VOY: "Imperfection") When she was twelve years old, she walked home in a thunderstorm over seven kilometers because she lost a tennis match. (VOY: "Deadlock") In 2354, during high school, she gave up playing tennis; she ultimately didn't pick it up again until 2373. (VOY: "Future's End") Janeway was also experienced in pool, even though the first time she played it with the crew in Tom Paris' holodeck simulation Chez Sandrine, she led everyone to believe that she was a novice. (VOY: "The Cloud") She also enjoyed skiing. (VOY: "Macrocosm")

Janeway had a special relationship with her father, who had raised her to be a doubter and a skeptic and to look at the world with the scientist's eye. When he died by drowning under a polar icecap on Tau Ceti Prime sometime before 2358, she was devastated. She was so grief-stricken she fell into a terrible depression and spent months in bed, sleeping away her days. Her sister eventually forced her into the real world again. (VOY: "Coda")

Janeway credited the family tale of her ancestor, Shannon O'Donnel, for inspiring her to join Starfleet. The family tale claimed that O'Donnell had been involved as the driving force in ensuring the construction of the Millennium Gate, despite strong local opposition. O'Donnell was also believed to be an early female astronaut, the first of a line of Janeway explorers. Much to Janeway's disappointment, research in 2376 revealed that her involvement in the Millennium Gate project had been far less prominent than everyone thought and that she had been a mere consulting engineer on the project. However, Seven of Nine told her that her inspiration to Janeway should not be diminished by this, as she was still the driving force behind her desire to join Starfleet and become an explorer. (VOY: "11:59")

During her lifetime, Janeway studied chromolinguistics, American Sign Language, and the gestural idioms of the Leyron. However, she struggled with basic Klingon. (VOY: "Macrocosm", "Hope and Fear")

Academy years
A grown Janeway meets a Boothby replica
When she was a cadet in Starfleet Academy, Janeway had a close relationship with Boothby, the chief custodian of the Starfleet gardens, who brought fresh roses to her quarters each morning. Janeway also enjoyed spending her time at a little coffee shop on Market Street known as "the Night Owl". (VOY: "In the Flesh") Her love of coffee and her late nights got her through many of her classes, as she often had to pull all-nighters. (VOY: "Good Shepherd") She studied under such memorable professors as Patterson, Hendricks, and H'ohk. Janeway was also considered an intelligent and adaptive cadet. (VOY: "Relativity", "Friendship One", "Darkling")

Starfleet career
Janeway's first Starfleet posting was aboard the USS Al-Batani, under the command of Captain Owen Paris. She served as the chief science officer during the ship's participation in the Arias Expedition. (VOY: "Caretaker", "Bride of Chaotica!", "Live Fast and Prosper", "Shattered") Janeway once revealed that, at one point during her posting aboard the Al-Batani, she knocked out power to six decks by misaligning the ship's positronic relays. (VOY: "Shattered")

While a junior science officer, Janeway envied the captain's privilege of making first contact with alien species. (VOY: "Innocence")

While she held the rank of lieutenant, she was the member of an away team which defended a Federation outpost from Cardassians during a border conflict. They ended up cut off in a three-day long firefight with the Cardassians. One night during a break in the fighting, her commanding officer ordered her and an ensign to crawl out into the brush and save a wounded Cardassian soldier. At the time, she thought her commander crazy, but in retrospect saving that man's life was one of her proudest moments. In the end, her away team secured the outpost and all members were decorated by Starfleet Command. (VOY: "Prey")

Janeway first met Tuvok, who later became one of her closest friends and confidants, in 2356. Janeway was dressed down by Tuvok in front of three Starfleet admirals for failing to observe proper tactical procedures during her first command. Although the incident bruised her "Human ego" at the time, she ultimately realized Tuvok was correct. (VOY: "Fury", "Revulsion") From 2365 onward, Janeway and Tuvok became close friends, and Janeway found she could always "rely on his insightful and unfailingly logical advice." During the mid-2360s, when Tuvok was temporarily assigned to Jupiter Station, he often wrote to Janeway. (VOY: "Tuvix") By 2371, Tuvok had made detailed psychological observations about Janeway over the course of four years. (VOY: "Revulsion", "Phage")

While in her first year as a commander aboard the USS Billings, Janeway sent an away team to survey a volcanic moon. Their shuttle was damaged by a magma eruption and three crewmembers were severely injured. The next day, she returned to the moon, alone, to complete the survey. She wanted the crew to know that their suffering had not been in vain, despite the possibility that she could have been killed. (VOY: "Night")

Taking command of Voyager
Janeway takes the center seat in 2371
In 2371, Janeway took command of the USS Voyager and received her first general order at Starfleet Headquarters. She was to locate a missing Maquis vessel, the Val Jean, which had disappeared in the Badlands with her security officer Tuvok, who was working as an undercover agent. Given the navigational challenge in this region of space, she proposed to Admiral Patterson to rehabilitate Tom Paris – an excellent pilot and disgraced son of her former captain, now Admiral Paris, as well as a former Maquis – for the mission. She visited Paris at the Federation Penal Colony in New Zealand, where he was serving time for his involvement with the Maquis. In exchange for his help in finding the Val Jean, Janeway offered to Paris that she would help him at his next review. Paris was less than enthused about returning to Starfleet after his disgraceful dismissal, but the moment he found out that he would be cut loose, he agreed to join.

While chasing the Val Jean in the Badlands, both ships were engulfed by a displacement wave that hurled them seventy thousand light years into the far side of the galaxy, deep into the Delta Quadrant. (VOY: "In the Flesh", "Relativity", "Caretaker")

Beginnings in the Delta Quadrant
After finding Voyager transferred 70,000 light years across the galaxy, Janeway soon discovered that they had been brought there by a sporocystian lifeform known as the Caretaker. The Caretaker was dying and therefore looking for a suitable mate so that his offspring could continue to care for a species known as the Ocampa. He held a debt to the Ocampa because, many years ago, he had been responsible for the destruction of their planet's atmosphere, forcing the Ocampa to move below ground, in turn prompting the Caretaker to continue providing for them.

The Caretaker had pulled both the Val Jean and Voyager into the Delta Quadrant in order to see if anyone in their crews might be a compatible mate. To that end, he abducted the crew of both ships and conducted experiments. These efforts proved unsuccessful, however, as he found himself to be incompatible with any of Voyager's or the Val Jean's crew members. Unfortunately, two of the crew members – B'Elanna Torres from the Maquis and Harry Kim from Starfleet – became ill after the experiments and were sent to the Ocampa homeworld for care and treatment. Given their perilous situation and the missing crew members, Janeway and the captain of the Val Jean, a former Starfleet commander named Chakotay, decided to put aside their differences in order to locate their missing people and find a way home.

While searching for answers to their dilemma, they encountered a small Talaxian freighter manned by a man named "Neelix" who, in exchange for water, agreed to help the crews retrieve their missing shipmates.

The Caretaker's condition kept deteriorating and he died before being able to send back Janeway's and Chakotaty's ships to the Alpha Quadrant. Even though Lieutenant Tuvok believed he could activate the system that could send Voyager back, it would have meant leaving the technology in the hands of a hostile native species, the Kazon – who were going to use it to get to the Ocampa. Realizing that this was a sacrifice she was not willing to make, Janeway destroyed the Caretaker's array by using two tricobalt devices at a yield of twenty thousand teracochranes. Evacuating his crew to the Starfleet vessel, Chakotay crashed his ship into a Kazon carrier vessel in order to protect Voyager while it destroyed the array.

This decision left Voyager stranded 70,000 light years in the Delta Quadrant, with their only means to get home destroyed. Recognizing their long, daunting journey ahead, both Starfleet and Maquis crews merged and decided to work together when embarking on their seventy-year-long journey home. Chakotay became Janeway's first officer and second in command of the ship. The decision to merge the Maquis and Starfleet forces was controversial for both sides at first, but the crews soon learned to work together under the new joint command structure. (VOY: "Caretaker", "Parallax", "The Voyager Conspiracy")

USS Voyager
2371
One of the problems facing Janeway when Voyager first became trapped in the Delta Quadrant was to combine the Maquis and Starfleet crews into one cohesive unit for their journey back home. Their violent hurdle into the Delta Quadrant had left them with empty key positions that urgently needed to be filled, such as the position of first officer previously held by Lieutenant Commander Cavit, the helm, chief engineer, a transporter chief, and the entire medical staff, including the chief medical officer.

Early on in the voyage, there was an incident between B'Elanna Torres, who was a Maquis, and Joe Carey of Starfleet. Having a fiery temperament, Torres had punched Carey in the nose over a disagreement in engineering. Chakotay, despite being furious about Torres' lack of discipline, still recommended her for the position of chief engineer; a proposal which Janeway initially dismissed, as she saw Torres as an undisciplined troublemaker unfit to hold a command position. Chakotay kept standing up for Torres, however, and after seeing first hand what she was capable of, Janeway agreed to give her the position. (VOY: "Parallax")

Janeway fixes the timeline
While visiting a planet which had been devastated by a polaric ion explosion, Janeway and Tom Paris were transported back in time, due to a fracture in subspace. They got caught up between a group of protesters and government officials disagreeing over an energy source and its potential dangers. When the protesters took over a power plant, Janeway came to believe that it would become the source of the explosion, but as an away team from Voyager tried to rescue them by cutting into subspace, she realized that this was the actual cause of the catastrophic events. She sealed the rift, and a new timeline was created, where the explosion never happened. (VOY: "Time and Again")

Janeway dreams of the possibility of finally having found a way home
Janeway's fallen hopes of returning home
During the first year of the voyage, Janeway made first contact with a number of species, one of which were the Vidiians, who were plagued by an incurable phage and as a result harvested the organs of other species for survival. During an away mission, Neelix's lungs were stolen by the Vidiians and The Doctor had to create a pair of holographic lungs to keep him alive. After searching for and finding the Vidiians responsible, it turned out that they had already bio-transformed Neelix's lungs. However, they possessed the medical knowledge to do an organ transplant and, having been unexpectedly spared, resolved to do all they could. Kes donated one of her lungs to Neelix. Janeway was furious with the Vidiians and promised them that, should they harm any members of her crew again, she would not be so generous. (VOY: "Phage")

Janeway also led the ship into a nebula that was really an organic lifeform. Upon discovering that they had injured the space-dwelling being, she and her crew immediately worked on a procedure to repair any damage they might have caused to it. (VOY: "The Cloud")

Their hopes of returning home were renewed when Voyager came upon a micro-wormhole that ended in the Alpha Quadrant. Janeway made contact with a Romulan ship captained by Telek R'Mor. They successfully transported R'Mor through the wormhole onto Voyager and to the Delta Quadrant, only to find out that that version of R'Mor was from twenty years in the past. Heartbroken, Janeway asked R'Mor to at least transmit the crews' messages, twenty years later, to their loved ones. When R'Mor was beamed back to 2351, Tuvok informed the captain that he had, in fact, died in 2367 and that it was unlikely that he could relay the messages. (VOY: "Eye of the Needle")

The same year, Janeway and her crew made first contact with the Sikarians, a friendly and hospitable species that possessed some rather groundbreaking technology; they were capable of folding space, thus allowing ships to travel great distances in short amounts of time. However, the Sikarians had their own set of prime rules, one of which prohibited them from sharing key technology with other species. Janeway tried to negotiate with their leader, but he simply refused to share the technology. Humiliated and helpless, Janeway decided to move on, but some crew members, including Seska and B'Elanna, but also Carey and even Tuvok, were not willing to take no for an answer and looked for alternate means to acquire the technology. However, when they tried to use it, they found that it was not compatible with Federation technology. When Janeway found out, she was more than upset to see this level of insubordination among her crew. She warned B'Elanna Torres to never cross the line again or else she would no longer be an officer on the ship. Her biggest disappointment was in Tuvok, however, who had led the operation; she felt let down, but he explained that, according to his logic, he had had no choice but to do what the captain had been morally unable to do. Even though she was touched by his loyalty and willingness to sacrifice for her, Janeway told him to never act on his logic again without consulting with her, telling him that she needed to be able to count on him as he was the one she turned to when she needed her moral compass checked. (VOY: "Prime Factors")

Later that year, she and the rest of the crew found out that Seska, a member of the Maquis crew, was really a Cardassian spy altered to look Bajoran, and that she had been giving Federation technology to the Kazon-Nistrim. Seska berated the captain for having destroyed their last chance to get home and thought her to be a fool for continuing to hold on to what Seska believed to be useless Starfleet principles at the expense of her crew. Janeway tried to explain to her that sharing even minor technology might have dire consequences for the balance of power in that part of space, but Seska, blinded by vindication, could not be convinced. She left Voyager and joined Maje Culluh of the Kazon-Nistrim. Throughout the year, she and Culluh plotted ever newer ways to get to Voyager and capture it. (VOY: "State of Flux")

Despite constant attacks by alien races in an unknown and potentially hostile part of space, Janeway also discovered some favorite pastime for the times Voyager was not on constant guard. In order to relax, she participated in a Gothic holodeck program in which she was the governess of a mysterious mansion. (VOY: "Cathexis")

The integration of the Maquis crew into the Starfleet crew was not smooth and, at the beginning of their journey, both crews faced some challenges. When a few members of the Maquis who were not well versed with Starfleet protocols and procedure exhibited disruptive and even insubordinate behavior, Janeway proposed that, instead of punishment, they take on the responsibility of getting those crew members up to speed and instruct them in how to run a Starfleet vessel. For that purpose, Tuvok, who had Academy teaching experience, was put in charge of training crew members who could benefit the most from such training. (VOY: "Learning Curve")

2372
Amelia Earhart and Janeway, with Voyager landed behind
In 2371, Voyager discovered Amelia Earhart and other Humans in stasis. They had been captured by the Briori to become slaves, but their descendants had revolted and overthrown their alien captors. The Humans on the planet believed that the eight ancestors were dead and honored them in a shrine. Upon revival, the group (nicknamed "the 37's") decided to stay on the planet with their "descendants." Earhart invited Voyager's crew to stay as well, but they decided to continue their journey home. (VOY: "The 37's")

During an attack by space-dwelling lifeforms, Kes began to prematurely enter puberty. This was the first time Janeway was faced with the possibility that, on their long voyage home, crew members would eventually start pairing off and maybe even having children. Although the aliens were driven off and Kes returned to her normal state, Ensign Samantha Wildman informed Janeway that she was, in fact, pregnant. (VOY: "Elogium")

Voyager came across an anomaly that distorted the structure of the ship, trapping the senior staff in the holodeck. Janeway was injured by the anomaly, but the crew soon realized that it was actually sentient, attempting to communicate. (VOY: "Twisted")

The same year, the ship was attacked by the Botha, who caused violent hallucinations in the crew; Janeway hallucinated about her fiance, Mark. However, The Doctor and Kes were able to drive the aliens away, and Voyager's crew recovered. (VOY: "Persistence of Vision")

Janeway also met up with the Caretaker's partner, Suspiria, who had been taking care of an Ocampa colony. She attacked Janeway and Voyager, whom she blamed for the Caretaker's death. Kes was able to distract Suspiria with her telekinetic powers, allowing Janeway to fire a toxin at Suspiria that disabled her. (VOY: "Cold Fire")

Janeway and Caylem
Janeway later helped rescue Tuvok and Torres from a Mokra Order prison, after being nursed back to health by Caylem, who believed she was his daughter, Ralkana. His wife and daughter had been killed resisting the Mokra Order. As Caylem was dying, Janeway posed as his daughter to assure him that she and his wife were fine. (VOY: "Resistance")

When Tom Paris broke the warp ten barrier that same year, he began exhibiting strange behavior until his DNA completely mutated and transformed him into an amphibian species. In his delirious state, he abducted Janeway and embarked on a warp ten journey with her, which resulted in her DNA mutating as well. When they were discovered by Voyager a short while later, they had mated and produced offspring. After The Doctor was able to restore them back to their Human form, they decided to leave the offspring on a planet where they had left them. Janeway joked to Paris that, while she had thought about having children, she'd never believed it was going to be with him. (VOY: "Threshold")

"Captain Janeway... USS Voyager"
Janeway also had her first contact with Q. While exploring a comet, the Voyager crew accidentally released what turned out to be a Q from the core of the comet. After some time, the well-known Q arrived, telling Janeway that the other Q, eventually known as "Quinn", had tried to kill himself many times, and that this was the reason for his captivity. Quinn asked for asylum and a chance to become Human. He argued that, although the existence of a Q is exhilarating and incredible at first, the initial wonder very soon turns to boredom, as there is nothing more to explore, nothing more to reveal about the universe or anything. Because of this unbearable lack of purpose in the Q Continuum, he wished to end his life. Janeway granted his request after a hearing on the matter, where numerous witnesses, including Maury Ginsberg and the USS Enterprise's William T. Riker, took part. She urged Quinn to lead a full mortal life. Regardless, he killed himself, receiving a poison from Q, who revealed himself as a sympathizer with the late Q in the end. (VOY: "Death Wish")

Janeway meets her double
While attempting to avoid a number of Vidiian ships, Voyager entered a divergence field and was duplicated in nearly every aspect, including the crew. The two ships were connected by a rift in the lower decks that allowed passage between both ships, but they faced danger as they drew on the same antimatter supply. When the Vidiians attempted to board one of the Voyagers, both crews were in danger, and one of the Janeways destroyed her ship, killing the Vidiians and saving the other Voyager. (VOY: "Deadlock")

Janeway later faced a crisis of conscience when a transporter accident fused Neelix and Tuvok into one being, Tuvix. The only way to bring them back to their original form was to eliminate Tuvix, who protested the murder. Janeway had to execute a new, sentient, and innocent lifeform so that she could have Tuvok and Neelix brought back to life. The event that followed was considered one of the most controversial and immoral decisions ever committed by a Starfleet captain. However, according to current records, despite Federation law, no charges or court martial was ever placed for the action. (VOY: "Tuvix")

Janeway also confronted fear incarnate, in the form of The Clown. This occurred when she tried to save a group of aliens who, while in stasis, had been trapped by their malfunctioning neural link. When the consciousness of some of her crew became trapped in the program, The Doctor served as an "ambassador" to negotiate with The Clown (the "ruler" of that network, serving as the personification of the aliens' fear that something would go wrong). Voyager's crew eventually tricked The Clown into letting his prisoners out by having Janeway connect to the network without actually entering it, a holographic Janeway, sent in to trick The Clown, informing him that fear existed to be conquered and that he would now vanish. (VOY: "The Thaw")

Along with Chakotay, Janeway was subsequently left behind on a planet, due to an incurable disease that the atmosphere of the planet inhibited. They began to show affection for each other, but a possible relationship was put on hold when the crew disobeyed direct orders and contacted Vidiians who knew of a cure. (VOY: "Resolutions")

Janeway and crew left behind
The rest of the year was spent in confrontation with the Kazon. Chakotay was captured by the Kazon and tortured when he refused to give up secrets of Voyager's defenses. Paris left the ship under a ruse to uncover the traitor in Voyager's crew. Janeway tried to form alliances with the Trabe, enemies of the Kazon, to force both sides to participate in a peace conference; the conference ended in disaster when the Trabe tried to kill the Kazon. (VOY: "Maneuvers", "Investigations", "Alliances") Sometime later, Voyager was captured, and the crew was stranded on a prehistoric planet. (VOY: "Basics, Part I", "Basics, Part II") After Paris – along with Lon Suder and The Doctor – regained the ship, the crew was rescued. Seska was killed and Culluh's power base was smashed, allowing Voyager to depart Kazon space with no further contact with them. (VOY: "Basics, Part II")

2373
Janeway blending in aboard the Excelsior
After Tuvok began suffering a mental breakdown in 2373, Janeway engaged in a mind meld with him, which took them back to his tour of duty on the USS Excelsior, captained by Hikaru Sulu. The breakdown was caused by an alien virus that had lain dormant in Tuvok's mind. (VOY: "Flashback")

Voyager was later assaulted by alien ships that attacked in great number. (VOY: "The Swarm") The Starfleet vessel also came across a planet ruled by two Ferengi who had become trapped by an unstable wormhole. Janeway devised a plan to oust the Ferengi who were exploiting the people. (VOY: "False Profits")

During a visit to a Nechani shrine, Kes was struck down by an energy surge and lapsed into a coma. Janeway underwent a series of rituals to help cure Kes, but, in the end, it was Janeway's faith that helped revive Kes. She took Kes through the energy field even though The Doctor told her it was deadly. It did no harm, and Kes was revived intact. (VOY: "Sacred Ground")

After an encounter with a timeship from the future, Voyager was transported back to the 20th century. They stopped Henry Starling, who had used the timeship for monetary gain, from launching the ship and altering history. The Doctor received his mobile emitter, which allowed him complete freedom to go anywhere. (VOY: "Future's End")

During that year, Q appeared on the ship and wanted to have a baby with Janeway, in order to stop a civil war in the Continuum. He transported her to the Continuum to escape a seemingly female Q who had boarded Voyager. The Human perception of the Q Civil War was set in the American Civil War, and Janeway and Q were captured, but the female Q along with the crew of Voyager managed to enter the Continuum and rescue them. When the Qs engaged in a truce, Voyager was returned to normal space, but not before Q presented his newborn son, whom he instead had with the female Q, to Janeway. (VOY: "The Q and the Grey")

Chakotay desperately trying to revive Janeway after their shuttle crashes
After an accident that left Janeway in a coma, an alien energy being tried to convince Janeway that she was dying. It fed off the souls of the dying, trying every trick to get her to cooperate, even appearing to her as her father, but she saw through the ruse and refused. Once the being left, The Doctor was able to revive her. (VOY: "Coda")

Near of the end of the year, Voyager was captured by the Nyrians, who replaced the crew with one of their number using a transporter and imprisoned them on a biosphere ship. Janeway led an escape by securing the transporter and beaming the Nyrian leader to one of their own biospheres simulating a frozen wasteland, forcing them to return Voyager. (VOY: "Displaced")

2374
Janeway as a nightclub owner
The following year brought Janeway and Voyager in contact with two dangerous races: the Krenim and the Hirogen.

Janeway faces a year of hell
The encounter with the Krenim began late in 2373 when a Krenim timeship tried to change history to restore the Krenim Imperium. This plunged Janeway and Voyager into a year-long battle. The presence of Voyager had upset the calculations used to restore the Imperium, and therefore Voyager had to be eliminated. Voyager came under a series of attacks by the technologically advanced Krenim, resulting in the loss of many of the crew and severe damage to the ship. It ended when Janeway suicide-crashed a mortally wounded Voyager alone into the timeship, destroying it and wiping it from existence. This restored the timeline and allowed Voyager to plot a course around Krenim space in the preferred timeline, avoiding Krenim territory entirely. (VOY: "Year of Hell", "Year of Hell, Part II")

Also during that year, the crew was subjected to various experiments carried out by cloaked aliens called the Srivani. After being close to death, the Voyager crew figured out a way to break the Srivani cloak, only to discover that the aliens had no intention of leaving, finding their studies much too interesting to abandon. The conflict ended when Janeway threatened to destroy the ship and the aliens along with it, partially because of the raised dopamine levels in her blood, by flying through a binary pulsar. This threat worked, however, and the Srivani, at the cost of one of their two vessels being destroyed by the pulsar, left the ship. (VOY: "Scientific Method")

The holoprogram Leonardo da Vinci, along with other Voyager technology, was stolen by pirates led by Tau. Janeway found his hideout and recovered the technology, including the Leonardo hologram. (VOY: "Concerning Flight")

Voyager discovered a communications network that allowed the crew to contact Starfleet. The network was owned by the Hirogen, a hunter race. When Tuvok and Seven of Nine beamed over to examine the network, they were captured by the Hirogen, who planned on killing them and using their bones as trophies. Janeway discovered that the network was being powered by a black hole, and, by increasing the power relays, she managed to disable the Hirogen ship and rescue the two. (VOY: "Hunters") Later, another Hirogen was encountered during his hunt for Species 8472, which continued on Voyager when the wounded Hirogen was beamed over for medical attention. (VOY: "Prey") The final contact with the Hirogen that year took place on Voyager. The Hirogen captured the starship and, using brainwashing techniques, used the crew as prey in various hunting programs in the holodeck. Janeway played the part of a Klingon warrior killed by the Hirogen as well as the leader of a French resistance unit during a World War II holosimulation. After becoming aware of what was happening, the crew managed to retake the ship when Janeway killed the Alpha Hirogen. As the Hirogen left the ship, she gave them holo-technology in hope that they would give up hunting live prey and use the holoprograms instead. (VOY: "The Killing Game", "The Killing Game, Part II")

Janeway set out to destroy a molecule known as the Omega molecule, the most dangerous and unstable substance known. She succeeded in destroying the molecule, but not without opposition from Seven of Nine. Seven, being a former Borg drone, still possessed incredible appreciation and awe of the Omega molecule, which the Borg believed to be perfect. (VOY: "The Omega Directive")

Janeway and Arturis
Near the end of the year, Janeway met Arturis, who helped them decode a Starfleet message. Decoding the message, they found a Federation ship that they believed had been sent to take them back to the Alpha Quadrant using slipstream technology, which Arturis offered to help them install. However, it was a ruse, as the ship had been manufactured by Arturis so that he could take Voyager and its crew to be assimilated. When his plan didn't work, he settled on Janeway and Seven of Nine being assimilated by the Borg. His people had been fighting the Borg, and their only hope had been that Species 8472 might defeat the Borg. When Janeway had helped the Borg, his people had subsequently been assimilated, and he now wanted revenge. Janeway managed to shut down the force field on his ship, and she and Seven were beamed back to Voyager as Arturis' ship arrived in Borg space. (VOY: "Hope and Fear")

On stardate 50979, unknown aliens attacked Ensign Harry Kim, The Doctor, and Ensign Ahni Jetal on an away mission. The Doctor had to decide between saving the life of either Jetal or Kim. The ensuing decision began an ethical battle between his original programming and his evolved personality. In order to combat this, Janeway ordered his program rewritten. Eighteen months later – when he recovered these memories – she again ordered his program rewritten. As a result of Seven disagreeing with her, she allowed The Doctor to remain as he was, working out the problems on his own with the support of the crew. (VOY: "Latent Image")

2375
In 2375, Janeway and Voyager made contact with a race known as the Malon. While entering a vast void in space with no stars, Janeway rescued a night being who was dying from radiation poisoning. The Malon, who were the garbage men of the quadrant, were dumping radioactive material in the aliens' space. The dying night being asked Janeway to close a vortex that the Malon were using to dump the material. Janeway decided to close the vortex, which had to be done inside the void, which would cause her to sacrifice herself. The crew refused to follow her orders and instead persuaded her to close the vortex as Voyager entered it. It caused a shock wave, but Voyager survived and closed the vortex, protecting the space of the night aliens. (VOY: "Night") Later that year, they encountered a Malon ship that was in danger of exploding and contaminating space due to ruptured fuel tanks. An away team found that a Malon who was disfigured from years of work on the ship had deliberately caused the damage, for revenge. (VOY: "Juggernaut")

Janeway discovered that Species 8472 had simulated Starfleet Academy as a training exercise to prepare for an invasion of Earth. This was based on Janeway's previous actions in their war with the Borg. When Janeway explained that she did not know that the Borg had started the war and that she hoped they could get home faster, the two groups found common ground. The leader of the simulation, having taken the form of Boothby, invited the crew to stay for a bit and treat it as shore leave, but Janeway politely declined, preferring to get underway for the real thing. (VOY: "In the Flesh")

Janeway demoted Paris for interfering with a water society. (VOY: "Thirty Days") She later had a romantic interlude with a Devore commander who, while looking for telepaths to arrest, asked for asylum aboard Voyager. The romance ended when the commander revealed himself as only pretending to defect in order to discover the whereabouts of the telepaths. (VOY: "Counterpoint")

Janeway as Queen Arachnia
Janeway played the part of Queen Arachnia, Queen of the Spider People, in one of Paris' holoprograms, The Adventures of Captain Proton. Aliens had taken the program as a serious threat and she had to "kill" Doctor Chaotica to satisfy the aliens that they were no longer in danger. (VOY: "Bride of Chaotica!")

Janeway saved Voyager and Seven from the Think Tank, a group of aliens who solved problems for a fee. They hired the Hazari to attack the ship, and, in return for solving Voyager's problem with the Hazari, they wanted Seven of Nine. (VOY: "Think Tank")

Janeway discovered another Federation ship lost in the Delta Quadrant, the USS Equinox, captained by Rudolph Ransom. He explained that his ship was attacked by creatures that killed much of his crew. The crew was beamed to Voyager for medical attention, and the Voyager crew attempted to repair the Equinox. Janeway discovered that the reason the creatures were attacking the Equinox was that Ransom had been capturing them and using them for fuel for the ship. Janeway confronted Ransom and arrested him and his crew. The EMH for the Equinox, which was beamed aboard Voyager, helped the crew escape back to the Equinox. They disabled Voyager, kidnapped Seven, and sped away. In the meantime, the creatures attacked Voyager. (VOY: "Equinox")

2376
Janeway pushed to the limit
Janeway became obsessed with finding Ransom, and resorted to means that would not have been acceptable to Starfleet. She was willing to kill a captured member of the Equinox, if he did not tell them the location of the ship, and confined Chakotay to his quarters when he interfered. When Voyager found Equinox, a battle ensued. When the Equinox was damaged by Voyager and attacked by the creatures, Ransom had a change of heart, dropped his shields, and surrendered Seven in exchange for his crew beaming aboard Voyager. He himself stayed with his ship as it exploded. Her final words to Ransom was agreeing with a promise to get her crew home. (VOY: "Equinox, Part II")

The same year, Tuvok was attacked by cloaked aliens during an away mission, and the weapons fire caused brain damage. Since The Doctor needed to examine the weapon in order to cure Tuvok, Janeway sought the Ba'Neth, the race of aliens responsible for the attack. With the help of Kesat Deputy Investigator Naroq, Janeway succeeded in tracking the Ba'Neth down. She used a photolitic converter to uncloak them. Janeway threatened to expose their location to other races, to which the Ba'Neth responded by handing over the weapon, and Tuvok was thereafter cured. (VOY: "Riddles")

Janeway encountered the Vaadwaur, a race that had been in stasis for nearly nine hundred years in order to survive the bombardment of their world, which had been destroyed by the Turei. After Seven of Nine opened one of the stasis pods without permission and a Vaadwaur named "Gedrin" was consequently awakened, Janeway offered to help him wake up the rest of his race, in return for allowing Voyager to use its subspace corridors, which would considerably cut the time to return home. She was unaware, though, that the Vaadwaur were a warrior race which had subjugated many of the races in their sector, including the Turei. They tried to take over Voyager but were unsuccessful. Gedrin refused to betray Janeway and helped Voyager escape. (VOY: "Dragon's Teeth")

Janeway and Voyager enlisted the help of Tash, who was working on a catapult vessel that could project a ship light years away and could thereby cut the time of Voyager's trip. However, Seven of Nine tried to sabotage the experiment. Attempting to bite off more than she could chew, she downloaded too much information into her cortical node, resulting in paranoid delusions. She believed that Voyager was part of a Federation invasion force into the Delta Quadrant and that the catapult would bring more ships into the quadrant. She told Chakotay this. At the same time, she told Janeway that the catapult would be used by Chakotay to launch a Maquis attack on the Federation. When Seven used the Delta Flyer to get away from Voyager, Janeway beamed over and was able to convince Seven that she was ill and needed medical attention. (VOY: "The Voyager Conspiracy")

Although Voyager was able to send messages to Starfleet through the Hirogen communications network, the network had been destroyed two years earlier and there had been no further contact. Lieutenant Reginald Barclay of Starfleet was able to make contact in that year by opening an artificial wormhole through which communication could occur. The next year, the link was further stabilized to allow daily visual communication for eleven minutes a day. (VOY: "Pathfinder", "Author, Author")

Enjoying the company of Michael Sullivan
Janeway found time to relax in a new holoprogram of Paris', called "Fair Haven". There, she became attracted to the main character, Michael Sullivan. Although Sullivan was happily married, Janeway solved that little issue by changing the program to make him single. Later in the year, she rescued Paris and Kim from the townsfolk, who believed they were evil spirits. (VOY: "Fair Haven", "Spirit Folk")

Voyager was drawn by a gravimetric wave into the orbit of a planet with a high rate of revolution. Because of a tachyon core breach, a second on Voyager was a day on the planet. While trapped in orbit, they observed the evolution of the planet. However, Voyager was unable to break orbit without significant harm inflicted on the planet, and, when the civilization began space travel, Voyager was threatened and attacked. When one of the astronauts landed on Voyager, Janeway explained the situation, and the pilot returned to his planet. Ships from the planet used a tractor beam to pull Voyager out of its orbit. (VOY: "Blink of an Eye")

Janeway also suffered an illusion that she and members of her crew took part in a massacre on the planet Tarakis. The massacre had taken place three hundred years prior, but a synaptic transmitter sent images to anyone who entered the system. This was done as a way of commemorating the people who had died. (VOY: "Memorial")

Voyager also encountered a Borg ship that was piloted by children who were separated from the hive due to an accident in space. After Seven of Nine convinced them to release captured crewmembers, Janeway allowed them to be beamed aboard Voyager and join her crew. Later, when she returned Icheb – the oldest of the former Borg children – to his parents on the Brunali planet, she found out that his parents only had him so he could be bait to defeat the Borg. Without the knowledge of the rest of their people, they had secretly genetically engineered him to produce a pathogen, and, when he was assimilated, the pathogen was spread among the Borg, effectively leading to their termination and causing the situation in which Voyager found their cube. The crew saved Icheb, who remained on Voyager. (VOY: "Collective", "Child's Play")

Later that year, after an efficiency report, Janeway became aware that three members of her crew were performing below standard. She decided to take the three on an away mission with her, in order to help them improve their efficiency. When the Delta Flyer was attacked by an unknown force, the trio rose to the occasion and saved the ship and Janeway. (VOY: "Good Shepherd")

Janeway also foiled a scam run by Dala, a con artist who was impersonating her. Dala was stealing goods and conning various races by pretending to be Janeway. (VOY: "Live Fast and Prosper")

Dealing with the "haunted" nebula
Janeway also had her last meeting with an elder Kes who, with her telekinetic powers, was attacking Voyager and, by traveling back in time, was trying to change the timeline by betraying Voyager to the Vidiians. She blamed Janeway for taking her away from her people, for developing her mental powers before she was ready to use them, and for destroying her youth. As the Vidiians boarded the ship in the past, Janeway was forced to kill the older Kes with a phaser, and Voyager broke free and escaped. Janeway explained to the young Kes in the past what had happened and she made a recording, explaining how happy she was and that her stay on Voyager was voluntary. When the older Kes again appeared in the normal timeline, she was convinced by the recording and left Voyager peacefully. (VOY: "Fury")

At the end of the year, Janeway returned an electric being, which had invaded Voyager, back to its home in a nebula. (VOY: "The Haunting of Deck Twelve")

2377-78
Janeway in 2377
In 2377 and 2378, the last years of Voyager's trip home, Janeway faced many dangers and old enemies.

The first threat came from an unlikely source: the Ferengi. Nunk, a Ferengi, tried to steal some of Seven's nanoprobes. He programmed a fake hologram of Barclay, which arrived on Voyager through the artificial wormhole Barclay had created to communicate with the ship. Nunk was able to steal the codes by using a dabo girl pretending to be a teacher – she was Barclay's girlfriend. The counterfeit Barclay would steer Voyager into a space accident, which would destroy the ship, and at the last minute take Seven and turn her over to the Ferengi. The plot was foiled by Barclay and Starfleet. (VOY: "Inside Man")

Janeway dealt with a mutiny by the Maquis, caused by a repressed brainwashing technique implanted into Tuvok by a Bajoran named "Teero Anaydis". (VOY: "Repression") The ship also became trapped in a void in space in which only those ships willing to plunder other ships for technology could survive. Voyager, by forming an alliance with other ships in the void, was able to escape. (VOY: "The Void") Chakotay recruited the aid of a past version of Janeway to restore the timeline on Voyager after the ship was hit with a distortion wave. (VOY: "Shattered")

Janeway dealt with Paris and Torres' marriage and pregnancy. She encountered Klingons who lived on a generation ship, were looking for the savior of their race and believed Torres was carrying that savior. (VOY: "Lineage", "Prophecy")

Janeway kidnapped by the Quarren
Janeway again encountered the Hirogen. They had used the holoprogram she had given them, after their attempt to take over Voyager, and had enhanced it so that the holograms had become sentient, but they, under Iden, rebelled, killing the Hirogen and other species they came in contact with. Janeway joined with the Hirogen and defeated Iden as well as his murderous desires. However, she protected the other holograms who wished to live in peace. (VOY: "Flesh and Blood")

The crew was later captured and brainwashed into believing that they were part of a Quarren workforce. Janeway became romantically involved with another employee before being rescued. (VOY: "Workforce", "Workforce, Part II")
