<html><p>The Doctor was responsible for the removal of Seven's implants, and also conducted her weekly maintenance sessions. He also took it upon himself to teach Seven social behavior, using the same interpersonal relationship exercises Kes once practiced with him. (VOY: "Prey") Later, he created a holodeck simulation of Voyager for her to become more comfortable with large social gatherings. (VOY: "One")

The Doctor encouraged Seven to explore romantic relationships in 2375, coaching her in the basics of dating and grooming. He also discovered her singing voice, and the two sang a duet of "You Are My Sunshine". He was partially motivated by a wager made with Ensign Paris, who believed that Seven would not be able to bring a date to a reception planned aboard Voyager without making a scene. Although Seven's date with Lieutenant Chapman ended up in disaster, she attended the reception with The Doctor, and charmed the guests with a toast to individuality. However, she was hurt to discover that The Doctor's help was due to the bet. At this point, The Doctor found that he himself was falling in love with Seven, but refused to admit it to her. He tried to apologize to her, but she came to him first and said she no longer needed the lessons in romance because there were no suitable mates aboard. The Doctor was very disappointed that Seven did not reciprocate his feelings. (VOY: "Someone to Watch Over Me")

In 2376, The Doctor was stranded aboard the USS Equinox along with Seven, and the crew disengaged his morality subroutines to extract activation codes for their warp drive from Seven's cranial implants, which would leave her mentally disabled. The Doctor almost went through with the procedure, but Captain Rudolph Ransom stopped him. He apologized to Seven for the incident, and she held no ill will towards him. (VOY: "Equinox, Part II")

The Doctor created a subroutine for daydreaming in early 2376. Seven featured prominently in several fantasies, either serving as a damsel in distress or competing with other female Voyager crew members for The Doctor's affections. He even fantasized about painting her in the nude. When the fantasies began to overrun his program, his mental activity was tied into the holodeck, allowing Seven to see what he had been daydreaming. She did not take offense, but after she kissed him following Captain Janeway's announcement that the Emergency Command Hologram subroutines would be developed, she made it clear that it was simply a platonic gesture. (VOY: "Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy")

The Doctor as Seven of Nine
While Ensign Kim, Seven, and The Doctor conducted a routine survey on board the second Delta Flyer in 2377, they were captured by a race known as the Lokirrim. The Lokirrim had waged war against holographic lifeforms who rebelled against Lokirrim rule, and as a result, banned all holographic activity within their borders. Seven transferred The Doctor's program to her cortical implant in order to hide him from the Lokirrim and prevent him from being decompiled. In the process, The Doctor took control of Seven's motor abilities, and was essentially trapped in her body. The Doctor tried to engineer an escape by cultivating a relationship with a Lokirrim official, Ranek, but the new sensations of taste and emotion were too tempting for The Doctor. He ended up overindulging in several foods and causing pain to Seven. Ranek later called Seven to the ship's bridge with the intention of setting up a romantic liaison. Although The Doctor was able to see his command codes, Ranek attempted to kiss him in Seven's body, which was not reciprocated. Shortly afterward, he went to complain about the incident to Jaryn, a crewmember The Doctor had been working with to treat injured Lokirrim crew. The Doctor became sexually aroused when Jaryn gave Seven a neck massage. Both incidents greatly irritated Seven, and once The Doctor had been returned to the mobile emitter they got into an argument about the values of indulgence. The Doctor felt Seven showed excessive restraint and did not allow for superfluous pleasure, which The Doctor believed was an important part of life. Kim managed to return the subject to escape, and The Doctor and Seven worked together once again to transmit a distress signal to Voyager. The Doctor was downloaded back into Seven's implants, and was able to convince Ranek to join her on a "second date." They knocked him out at the first available opportunity, and transmitted a message to Voyager including the ship's command codes. Their plan was discovered by Jaryn, and Seven was taken captive. After Voyager arrived, Seven returned The Doctor's program to the mobile emitter and they escaped. Upon their return to the ship, Seven decided that The Doctor had a point about her restraint concerning pleasures such as food. She brought a meal to sickbay and described the sensations of eating it to The Doctor, allowing him to experience it vicariously. (VOY: "Body and Soul")

When The Doctor's rights as an individual came into question, Seven testified at the hearing conducted with Starfleet Command. She spoke highly of The Doctor, appreciative of his efforts to develop her individuality. (VOY: "Author, Author")

In 2378 when The Doctor believed he was about to die, he finally admitted his feelings for her, and was embarrassed when he survived. (VOY: "Renaissance Man")  The Doctor was also crestfallen when he learned Seven had begun to date Chakotay. (VOY: "Endgame")

Chakotay
Seven of Nine and Chakotay share a private moment in 2378
Like many of the crew, Chakotay was distrustful of Seven during her first year on board. He questioned Captain Janeway when she chose to leave Seven in control while the ship traversed a Mutara-class nebula. (VOY: "One")

Chakotay was interested in the early history of space exploration, and jumped at the chance to retrieve the Ares IV command module from a graviton ellipse encountered by Voyager in 2376. Seven saw this fascination as dangerous, and she was proven right when the Delta Flyer, sent to retrieve the module, was trapped in the ellipse. She was upset with Chakotay, but her attitude changed when she beamed over to the command module to retrieve a component to repair the damaged Flyer. Chakotay told her to savor the moment and recover as much history as possible. She replayed Lieutenant John Kelly's logs, and was touched by his devotion to duty. She had his body beamed back to the Flyer and spoke in admiration of Kelly at his funeral aboard Voyager. (VOY: "One Small Step")

Seven considered a romantic relationship with Chakotay in 2378. In her holodeck simulation of Voyager, Chakotay became her love interest, and she went on several dates with him. To her embarrassment, The Doctor learned of the simulation when she collapsed on the holodeck due to her Borg programming, designed to shut down the implants of a drone should he/she experience strong emotion. These implants would require dangerous, repeated surgeries to remove, and Seven chose not to proceed. (VOY: "Human Error")  The Doctor strove to develop a safer method of removing this obstacle to her development and several months later he was able to remove the implants with a single surgical procedure. After the affected implants were removed, Seven was free to become involved with the real Chakotay, and the two began dating in 2378. Neelix gave Seven ideas for dates. In an alternate timeline, when Admiral Janeway was forced to convince Captain Janeway to return to the nebula, she revealed that Seven of Nine and Chakotay later married. (VOY: "Endgame")

Physiology
The Doctor was able to remove most of Seven's implants and restore most of her Human appearance, but she still had some Borg technology left; these were tied into her vital functions, and removing them would have killed her. Initially, she also still needed to regenerate, like a Borg drone, using a Borg alcove, because her natural metabolism wasn't yet functional enough to support her on its own; with time, the frequency with which she had to do so diminished. (VOY: "Human Error", "Natural Law"). She was given a special suit and also issued a combadge. (VOY: "The Gift")

As a former drone, Seven had considerable superior physical characteristics over most Humans. Her visual acuity was vastly superior, due to her ocular implant, along with an eidetic memory and superior physical strength for a healthy Human woman her age. (VOY: "The Gift", "Vis à Vis", "Tsunkatse", "Scientific Method", "Relativity") As for her regular Human senses, they were more acute than the average Human as well. (VOY: "Body and Soul") Her heart and respiratory system were completely reinforced. (VOY: "The Haunting of Deck Twelve") She was also much more resistant to injury and many forms of radiation, including chroniton and subnucleonic radiation that would quickly kill an ordinary Human. (VOY: "Year of Hell", "One") In addition, she became an extremely proficient martial artist, mastering the Norcadian martial art of Tsunkatse. (VOY: "Tsunkatse") With her Borg implants, she was also able to serve as a physical host to any holographic character, who then had full access to her biological senses. (VOY: "Body and Soul")

Her enhanced Borg physiology also had its downside, such as being prone to malfunctions or failures or receiving unwanted transmissions from the Borg Queen or other Borg devices. (VOY: "The Raven", "Dark Frontier", "Imperfection") Her powerful nanoprobes were highly sought after and in the Ferengi market each sold for six bars of latinum. In fact, in 2377 Ferengi marauders attempted to obtain Seven of Nine's nanoprobes by perpetrating an elaborate scheme. Seven's nanoprobes had multiple applications which made them so valuable, including slowing the aging process and even reanimating dead tissue. (VOY: "Inside Man") As the result of an infected Borg vinculum that had identified her as an errant drone and was trying to reintegrate her into the collective, Seven once developed multiple personality disorder exhibiting the behavior and personalities of the individuals assimilated by the Borg during her eighteen years as a drone. (VOY: "Infinite Regress") When she was once experimenting with the nature of individuality and intimate relationships, experiencing a host of strong emotions unfamiliar to her, her cortical node shut down as a fail-safe mechanism to deactivate drones who started to regain their emotions. (VOY: "Human Error")

Alternate Seven of Nine
Holograms
Seven of Nine, projected from The Doctor's daydreams
Seven of Nine was holographically duplicated on a number of occasions:

Seven of Nine was created by The Doctor so he could practice expressing his romantic feelings to the real Seven. (VOY: "Someone to Watch Over Me")
A holographic representation of Seven in the nude was being painted by The Doctor when his daydreams were projected into the holodeck. (VOY: "Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy")
A hologram of Seven was used in order to evaluate the chances of a successful replacement of Seven's cortical node. (VOY: "Imperfection")
A hologram of Seven as a Borg Drone was used by the Kyrian Museum of Heritage set in 2374, to detail their encounter with the warship Voyager, as an aid to a history lesson. (VOY: "Living Witness")
Alternate realities and timelines
In 2374, most of Voyager's crew was duplicated by a biomimetic lifeform known as the "Silver Blood." (VOY: "Demon")  The crew eventually agreed to allow the silver blood to replicate every individual on board, and the real crew left the class Y world. They began to forget their origins and ultimately started to believe that they were the real Voyager crew and set a course for the Alpha Quadrant. By mid 2375, they had developed an enhanced warp drive and were closer to the Alpha Quadrant than the real Voyager. At the wedding of that ship's Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres, Seven caught the bouquet.

Shortly following this event, the enhanced warp drive began to degrade the structure of the ship and the crew, as it was harmful to the "Silver Blood." Captain Janeway decided to continue to the Alpha Quadrant in spite of this discovery, and did not attempt to locate a Class Y planet until many of the crew had succumbed to the degradation and the ship was severely damaged. Seven was one of the last crew members to degrade, and she attempted to build a message beacon out of non-affected materials to launch and hopefully be recovered. The beacon was later destroyed after the launch mechanism failed, and the Voyager disintegrated just as the real Voyager caught up to it. (VOY: "Course: Oblivion")

Sometime in the 29th century, Captain Braxton, of the Federation timeship USS Relativity, went back to 2371 and planted a temporal disruptor on Voyager in order to destroy it. The crew of the Relativity recruited Seven of Nine from late 2375 to help find the device because her ocular implant was capable of detecting it. Seven was altered in order to look Human, given a blue Starfleet uniform, and sent to several time periods to pursue Braxton. Unfortunately, the side effects of the time travel were detrimental, and Seven died twice before discovering that Braxton was responsible. Further complicating matters, the timeline was contaminated by Seven's presence twice in the year 2371 and once in 2375, shortly before Seven was taken. Eventually, Braxton was apprehended and Captain Janeway helped repair the timeline by stopping Braxton before he ever had the chance to plant the disruptor. Slightly confused, Seven and Janeway were returned and reintegrated to the year 2375 and instructed not to tell of their experiences under order of the Temporal Prime Directive. (VOY: "Relativity")

When Voyager was fractured into several different time periods upon encountering a spatial rift in 2377, the cargo bay was reverted to 2374 when the Borg first transported onto Voyager. Chakotay was the only crew member not affected, and contacted the Seven of Nine of this time period. She designed a plan to use a chroniton field to bring the ship back into temporal sync. She later helped the Voyager crew retake engineering from Seska in 2373. (VOY: "Shattered")

In an alternate timeline occurring shortly after Voyager's first encounter with the Krenim in 2374, Seven developed a temporal shielding technology which protected the ship from the Krenim chroniton torpedoes as well as alterations in the timeline caused by Annorax's weapon ship. The shield was perfected when she determined the exact phase variance of an intact torpedo lodged in Voyager's hull, found while making repairs to Voyager's badly-damaged systems. The torpedo detonated while Seven and Tuvok were nearby. Although Seven was unharmed, Tuvok was blinded. She assisted him in daily tasks aboard Voyager, as surgery to correct the blindness was impossible in Voyager's state. When Voyager's crew was forced to share quarters due to power failures, she shared quarters with Ensign Brooks. Seven found living with her difficult, as her personal habits were "chaotic."  Seven remained aboard Voyager when most of the crew abandoned ship. (VOY: "Year of Hell") Seven later helped fit temporal shielding to the Mawasi fleet. The timeline was eradicated when Voyager collided with the temporal weapon ship, erasing it from history, along with any events caused due to the existence of the weapon ship. Thanks to Seven's temporal shielding, Voyager was able to erase the weapon ship from existence, thereby saving the entire galaxy from Annorax' catastrophic changes. (VOY: "Year of Hell, Part II")

In another alternate timeline created when Voyager used a quantum slipstream drive in 2375 but rode it all the way to the Alpha Quadrant, the ship crash-landed on an arctic planet, killing its entire crew. Harry Kim and Chakotay, who had survived the trip in the Delta Flyer, spent fifteen years trying to locate Voyager. They developed a plan to use a Borg temporal transmitter that they stole from the Federation to transmit the correct variance to Seven of Nine's cranial interplexing beacon in the past and therefore alter history. They stole the Delta Flyer and took it to Voyager, needing Seven's cranial implant and The Doctor's expertise to find her translink frequency allowing them to send the course corrections to USS Voyager and prevent the crash. Seven was located on the bridge and the reactivated Doctor removed her cranial implant. Once he was able to find her translink frequency – 108.44236000 – he attached it to the beacon. The first attempt to send the correction directly to her cranial implant failed, and Voyager was still lost. Kim then sent another correction, designed to collapse the slipstream, just before the Flyer, the alternate Harry Kim, Doctor, Chakotay and his girlfriend (Chakotay's) Tessa Omond were destroyed by the USS Challenger. The new plan worked, thus negating their deaths, and Voyager was saved. (VOY: "Timeless")

In yet another alternate timeline erased due to the actions of Admiral Kathryn Janeway, Chakotay and Seven were married aboard Voyager in the 2380s. However, Seven was killed on an away mission before Voyager returned home, and Janeway blamed herself for her death. This was a major motivation for her to travel back to 2378 and alter the past to bring Voyager home in that year. (VOY: "Endgame")

In the 31st century simulation of Voyager at the Kyrian Museum of Heritage, the incomplete records from Voyager's visit in 2374 painted the crew as murderers and savages. Seven, still with full Borg implants, was the leader of a group of Borg aboard Voyager who were sent to assault several Kyrians. This simulation was corrected after the reactivation of a backup copy of Voyager's EMH from the EMH backup module stolen during the ship's visit. (VOY: "Living Witness")

Miscellaneous
Seven's first real food after being severed from the Borg collective was chadre'kab. (VOY: "The Raven") She also developed a fondness for strawberries, left over from her childhood. (VOY: "Author, Author")

In The Doctor's USS Vortex holonovel entitled Photons Be Free, Seven's alter ego was a former drone named "Three of Eight". She was the only person aboard the Vortex who spoke in defense of The Doctor, and helped him escape after he was arrested for expanding his program. She pleaded with Captain "Jenkins" to prevent The Doctor's program from being decompiled, calling it a crime that individuals like The Doctor were not appreciated. When Tom Paris temporarily rewrote the program, the character became "Two of Three". Paris made light of The Doctor's obvious crush on Seven by making the holographic doctor in his program chauvinistic. The EMH character used a Klingon aphrodisiac on "Two of Three," causing her to react positively to his affections. (VOY: "Author, Author")

Seven and Chakotay made first contact with the Ventu on Ledos before the start of a conference on that planet. Initially hesitant to reach out to the primitive race, Seven was so moved by her experiences with the Ventu that she convinced Janeway to restore the energy barrier protecting the Ventu's lands and customs from the Ledosians. (VOY: "Natural Law")

Background information
Seven of Nine was played by actress Jeri Ryan. She first appeared in the fourth season opener, "Scorpion, Part II". Young Annika Hansen was played by Erica Lynne Bryan in "Scorpion, Part II" and "The Raven", and Katelin Petersen in "Dark Frontier".

The concept of Seven of Nine began while Brannon Braga was sitting at home, late one night, and saw a televised promotion for the Borg-centric third season installment "Unity". (Braving the Unknown: Season Four, VOY Season 4 DVD; Cinefantastique, Vol. 30, No. 9/10, p. 75) The idea of having a Borg crewman aboard the starship Voyager – a notion that instantly appealed to Braga – occurred to him as he was watching the advertisement. (Cinefantastique, Vol. 30, No. 9/10, p. 75) He then brought the character concept to the attention of fellow writer Joe Menosky. Braga later remembered, "I called Joe Menosky, and pitched this idea, and he thought it was a great idea. And then we talked about it and all the things.... 'What would that mean, to have a Borg character?' It would be really cool." (Braving the Unknown: Season Four, VOY Season 4 DVD) Braga also related, "I called Joe Menosky and we brainstormed. I wanted to make sure it wasn't a stupid idea." (Cinefantastique, Vol. 30, No. 9/10, p. 75) After Menosky approved of the concept, Braga called Executive Producer Rick Berman. "It was late, but I was so excited [....] He really liked the idea but he had the stroke of genius, 'Make it a Borg babe,'" said Braga. "And we just talked about it, for a couple hours, and we just thought, 'This is a really cool idea. This could be really... just the thing we need.'" (Braving the Unknown: Season Four, VOY Season 4 DVD) This marathon conversation between Berman and Braga took place in the spring of 1997. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 348) Berman was not the only executive producer to whom Braga suggested the idea of a Borg crew member, however. "I [...] took it in to Rick Berman and Jeri Taylor," Braga said, "and they liked the idea." (Cinefantastique, Vol. 30, No. 9/10, p. 75) Taylor herself commented, "The idea of having a female Borg was one of those that came largely through spontaneous combustion. It started with Brannon, and quickly gained a great deal of support." (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 348)

Seven of Nine was originally called "Perra" and had witnessed friends of hers being brutally killed around her at an outpost on Kelta Prime, a long time before she encountered Voyager and its crew. During that early incident, her Humanity, according to Perra herself, had "died." There was a time thereafter when she wished she had died along with her friends but, when she joined the Borg Collective, that emotional pain disappeared and she found the voices of the Collective to be comforting. This backstory was even written into casting sides that, in 1997, were used to audition the part. [2] The call sheets for the episodes "Scorpion, Part II" and "The Gift" also featured Ryan in the role of "Perra".

The character's final name was inspired by "Rhoda", codename EF709 ("seven-oh-nine"), a volumptous female android portrayed by Julie Newmar in the short-lived 1960s sitcom My Living Doll. [3]

Brannon Braga opined that Seven of Nine was the Spock or Data the show needed. "The Doctor came close," he said. "I liked The Doctor character. But Seven of Nine to me was like The Wild Child – I was inspired by that Truffaut movie about trying to tame someone who was raised by wolves or in this case someone raised by Borg." [4]

Brannon Braga envisioned, upon devising the Seven of Nine character, that she would ultimately be portrayed as meeting an unfortunate end. "Seven of Nine was, for me, designed to be a character that was gonna die tragically," Braga admitted. "I planned that." [5] He elaborated, "I thought she should have somehow sacrificed herself to get the closest thing she had to a family home. I think it would have been amazing but I was shot down. I was not running the show at the time; it was Ken Biller and Rick." [6]

An actress who auditioned for the role of Seven was Hudson Leick (Callisto from Xena: Warrior Princess). (Beyond the Final Frontier, p. 308; [7]) Another actress who read for the part was Claudia Christian (Ivanova from Babylon 5). (Beyond the Final Frontier, p. 308) Brannon Braga was involved in the casting process from the start. He commented, "We read a lot of different kinds of actresses of different ages. We narrowed it down to three, and Jeri Ryan was the best." (Cinefantastique, Vol. 30, No. 9/10, p. 75) Ryan tried out for the role in mid-May 1997. She recalled, "I, of course, auditioned like everyone else. As a matter of fact, I read a couple of times and then I got the job." (Star Trek Monthly issue 33, p. 17)

Jeri Ryan's first day on Star Trek: Voyager was Tuesday 27 May 1997 on which she had a medical appointment like all the other main cast members. On this day, there were also the interviews with Ryan's possible stand-ins for which recurring Star Trek: The Next Generation background actress Cameron was cast. Cameron later left the production during the episode "Hunters" and the stand-in position was re-cast with Brita Nowak. On Wednesday 28 May 1997, Ryan had her makeup and wardrobe tests followed by fittings on Thursday 29 May 1997. Her first day filming "Scorpion, Part II" was on Friday 30 May 1997 with a makeup call at 6:30 am and a set call at 10:00 am. On this day, Ryan filmed some bridge and ready room scenes on Paramount Stage 8.

The silver outfit
Seven's infamous costume began as a silver version in "The Gift", which was also used in "Day of Honor" and "Revulsion". It was retired because the material was too restrictive for actress Jeri Ryan's movement and it was difficult for her to breathe in, especially when she sat down. A new brown uniform, featuring a lower neckline, debuted in "The Raven", and a variant with a small collar is visible in "Scientific Method". A cobalt blue costume with grey shoulders and arms first appeared in "In the Flesh" but was replaced by an all-cobalt version in "The Disease". A plum-colored outfit first appeared in "Dark Frontier". Seven can be seen wearing a Starfleet uniform on only two occasions, the first being "Relativity", when she is undercover in Voyager's past, and the second being in "Human Error", in a holographic simulation. Her Borg costume was also revived in several episodes, mostly in flashback scenes.

Some fans jokingly call Seven "Barbie of Borg" and 36D of 9, due to a common belief that she was brought on board Voyager mainly to boost ratings among male viewers. Jeri Ryan freely admitted this to be true, saying, "I knew exactly what I was in for when I had my first costume fitting. Clearly my character was added to the show for sex appeal, which remains the one way to get attention very quickly. I don't think it's the only way to get viewers to watch strong women, but it worked. ". (TV Week magazine (Canada) of May 8-14, 1999 pages 6-7, 9 from "Super Moms", an interview by Michael Logan)

Kate Mulgrew admitted that she and Jeri Ryan did not see eye-to-eye while filming Voyager because "I had thought 'damn, we were going to forgo all of this with a female captain.' But the demographics proved the audience wanted more sex." However, she reflected that Ryan "did a marvelous job in a very difficult role. It was very clear to anyone with eyes in their head that Jeri Ryan’s beauty and sexual appeal were an important part of the numbers." [8]

The character Seven of Nine appeared in ninety-seven episodes of Star Trek: Voyager. Counting the Kyrian recreation of the character in "Living Witness", the biomimetic copy in "Course: Oblivion", and an illusory Seven of Nine in "Barge of the Dead", she appeared in exactly one hundred episodes.

Apocrypha
In the PC videogames Star Trek: Elite Force and Star Trek: Elite Force II, Seven was responsible for creating a device called "I-Mod" (Infinity Modulator). The I-Mod was specifically made to be used against the Borg. The I-Mod device was made into a weapon of its own (a rifle), capable of firing unique infinitely modulated shots that made adapting impossible.

According to the video game Star Trek: Starship Creator, Seven of Nine was born on Gemaura III to parents Seka and Han.

In an alternate future seen in the Deep Space Nine book trilogy Millennium, Seven, along with Voyager and her crew, returned to the Alpha Quadrant at an unspecified time. By 2399, Seven had been promoted to admiral. Seven, along with Hugh, helped to negotiate a treaty between the Federation and the Borg Collective, in the name of fighting the Bajorans, with whom the Federation was at war. In this future, she was apparently romantically involved with The Doctor. The entire timeline was reset thanks to Benjamin Sisko and the crew of Deep Space 9.

In the Voyager relaunch book series, Seven broke up with Chakotay, moved in with her aunt, and attained much undesired celebrity. She eventually joined a Federation "think tank" with The Doctor.

In the Next Generation relaunch novel Before Dishonor, Seven of Nine had become a civilian instructor at Starfleet Academy specializing in cybernetic technology. When Janeway was assimilated to become a new Borg Queen, Seven joined the crew of the USS Enterprise-E to reactivate the planet killer weapon with the assistance of Geordi La Forge and Spock in an effort to attack and destroy the Borg ship attacking Earth.

Following the events of Star Trek: Destiny, Seven of Nine's remaining Borg implants were seemingly destroyed. She underwent a severe emotional shift, yet to be explained, and began asserting her true name as Annika Hansen once again.

In the timeline for Star Trek Online, Seven of Nine joined Starfleet after Voyager's return to the Alpha Quadrant, and was assigned to a special Borg Task Force. When the task force was dissolved in 2385 – Starfleet believing the Borg were no longer a threat – Seven angrily disagreed with the decision and resigned from Starfleet, accepting a position at the Daystrom Institute instead. [9]

Seven appears in Delta Rising, the second expansion to STO, voiced once again by Jeri Ryan. In the wake of "Operation Delta Rising", a campaign to return to the Delta Quadrant to fight the Undine, Tuvok – now an admiral and commanding Voyager – asked Seven to leave the Daystrom Institute to work for the new Delta Alliance. Seven and her research team are rescued from a small outpost after the ship carrying them, the USS Callisto, is destroyed. Following a Voth fleet that mysteriously disengaged from combat, Seven and her rescuers arrive at the homeworld of the Turei, where they learn that the Vaadwaur have managed to gain advanced technology and have begun a campaign to reconquer the Delta Quadrant. Seven again expresses her guilt at awakening the Vaadwaur, but accepts Tuvok's offer to serve with him again on Voyager to combat the new threat. She also works alongside the Cooperative, a group of free Borg drones, in their efforts to avoid being reassimilated by the Collective or destroyed by their opponents.

For STO's tenth anniversary, Seven returns in the two-part episode "The Measure of Morality", now looking and sounding like her more "relaxed" appearance in Star Trek: Picard. While investigating possible Borg activity, the player character's ship is abducted by the Excalbians and forced to undergo further "trials" to determine the differences between good and evil. The player character and one of their officers are teamed with Seven and an Excalbian simulacrum of Michael Burnham to represent "good", as they battle "evil" forces in the Excalbians' simulations. During the Excalbian simulation on Essof IV, Seven inadvertently creates a Borg Queen in her image, using her genetic material fused with Control's nanites. The Borg Queen Seven then takes control of the Excalbians' "simulation", even manifesting a massive fleet in orbit of Excalbia, which is ultimately defeated by another Excalbian-manifested fleet, consisting of several starships Enterprise, as well as Voyager, the USS Discovery, and the USS Defiant.  In the patrol mission "One Night in Bozeman", part of the game's First Contact Day event, Seven is recruited by temporal agent Daniels to travel with the player character to April 4, 2063, just as the Borg Queen's sphere is bombarding Zefram Cochrane's missile complex near Bozeman, Montana (as depicted in Star Trek: First Contact). The Borg are attempting another change in the timeline, this time by focusing their attention on the civilians on the surface, as well as building a transporter from scraps to summon reinforcements from the partly-assimilated Enterprise-E. Seven and the player must rescue the civilians and destroy the transporter to ensure that the established events (including the involvement of the Enterprise crew) is not disrupted.
