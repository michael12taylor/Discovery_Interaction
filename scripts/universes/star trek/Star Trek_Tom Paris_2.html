<html><p>He also introduced Harry to one of his favorite holoprograms, the Chez Sandrine simulation. Not having lived by the rules for the longest time himself, he tried to get Harry to lighten up a little bit and enjoy himself. When Harry, for example, complained that he didn't want to drink that late at night as it gave him a heartburn, Tom told him to relax as it was holographic wine. (VOY: "The Cloud")

Captain Proton and his two sidekicks, Buster Kincaid and Constance Goodheart
Tom and Harry spent a lot of time together on the holodeck and in the Captain Proton adventures, Harry was Tom's sidekick, Buster Kincaid. Tom also gave Harry, who was often unsure and shy about the opposite sex, relationship advice and had his back when he got himself in trouble over a girl once. (VOY: " The Disease") Harry had a tendency to fall for the wrong girls, therefore Tom was always more than happy to remind him of his unlucky choices, such as the time when he fell in love with a hologram, or wanted the wrong Delaney sister (even though they were identical twins), or when he was infatuated with an ex Borg. (VOY: "Time and Again", "Alter Ego", "The Disease", "Ashes to Ashes") 

They shared some rather amazing adventures and were very supportive of each other when it came down to it. When in 2377 Tom found out that he was going to be a father, Harry teased him that it was all over now: no more late nights on the holodeck, no more racing the Delta Flyer, tied down with family and friends dropping out of the picture. Even though Tom did feel a little nervous about the prospects of becoming a father, he told Harry that it was fatherhood and not exile. (VOY: "Lineage") 

Tom with Harry Kim in 2377
However, while the two had many interests in common and got along, they also occasionally had their disagreements. Harry, unlike Tom, was very close to his family and missed them a great deal during their journey through the Delta Quadrant. When Voyager had managed to contact Starfleet and some crew members received personal messages from loved ones at home, Tom felt uncomfortable about the prospect of reconnecting with his life back on Earth. He told B'Elanna that what he had on Voyager was better than anything he had ever known. When he told a very enthused Harry – who was hoping to receive letters from his parents soon – to not get his hopes up, as no hopes meant no disappointments, Harry bluntly responded "I am not you" and walked out. (VOY: "Hunters") 

Their friendship truly strengthened when they had to rely on each other for survival in 2373: both were found guilty and detained in a prison for crimes they had not committed. There, they were controlled by a neural implant called a clamp, which induced paranoia and violence in the prisoners. When Paris was stabbed, Harry fiercely protected him from the violent inmates, but the two men suffered horribly in that prison and the stress of the neural implants did take its toll on both of them: when Paris, suffering from delirium, dismantled a tool Kim was going to use for an escape attempt, Kim almost killed him. Eventually Voyager was able to rescue them. This incident marked an important step in Tom's and Harry's friendship, as Tom realized the kind of friend he had found in Harry who not only saved his life, but also stood by him at his worst. Harry's devotion and loyalty were something Tom would remember for a long time. (VOY: "The Chute")

Kathryn Janeway
Captain Kathryn Janeway was a central figure in Tom Paris' personal and professional journey on board Voyager – helping him change for the better and grow into a responsible officer with integrity. 

At a time where everyone had given up on Tom, Janeway was willing to give him a chance to redeem himself. She had served under Tom's father on the USS Al-Batani and was aware of Tom's situation. In 2371 she approached him on the Federation Penal Colony in New Zealand where he was serving time for his association with the Maquis. She asked him to join Voyager in an attempt to retrieve a Maquis ship, the Val Jean, which had disappeared in the Badlands with her undercover security officer Tuvok on board. She was aware of Tom's exceptional piloting skills and gave him a chance to join her on the mission as a Starfleet observer. After the Caretaker's array was destroyed and the crew permanently stranded in the Delta Quadrant, she granted Tom the field commission of lieutenant junior grade for his exceptional accomplishments during their battle with the Kazon. For the first time in his life, Tom didn't know what to say. (VOY: "Caretaker")

Janeway disciplines Tom
In a way Tom was considered Captain Janeway's personal reclamation project and when he was caught by Chakotay during his gambling operation in Sandrine's, he reminded him that the captain had put a lot of faith in him and that she would be disappointed to find out about his recent conduct. Even though Paris' insubordination and lack of discipline were part of a larger plot to expose a traitor among the crew, everyone understood the importance of the faith she had placed in him. (VOY: "Lifesigns", "Meld") 

In 2375 when Paris disobeyed Janeway's warnings and then direct orders to not intervene in the affairs of the Moneans, he was demoted to the rank of ensign and sentenced to thirty days in solitary confinement in the brig. The charges were insubordination, unauthorized use of a space craft, reckless endangerment, and conduct unbecoming an officer. She told him that even though she understood his passion, passion alone didn't give him the right to take matters in his own hands. Janeway was gravely disappointed in Tom's conduct, which she believed was something he had finally grown past. She reminded him of the fresh start she had given him four years earlier. Tom admitted that even though he had never been very good at playing by the rules, it did not mean that serving under her command hadn't changed him for the better. Even though he regretted having let down Janeway, he felt proud because this time he had broken the rules for something he believed in. She promoted him back to lieutenant over a year later, commenting that his performance in the past year had been exemplary and she expected more of the same in future. (VOY: "Thirty Days", "Unimatrix Zero")

The Doctor
Tom Paris and The Doctor
Paris was chosen as The Doctor's medical assistant soon after Voyager was thrown into the Delta Quadrant. Citing his limited academic background in biochemistry, Janeway ordered him to begin training as a field medic. (VOY: "Parallax")  He remained the sole known flesh-and-blood medical assistant until The Doctor recruited Kes. (VOY: "Phage") While he presumably continued some level of medical training with The Doctor, Kes thereafter became The Doctor's primary assistant. Upon her departure, Paris increased his duty shifts in sickbay once again. Although he was initially reluctant, he proved to be highly capable at the job. 

Although their relationship was often a difficult one, as The Doctor saw Paris as flaky, self-indulgent and immature, they managed to become close friends nonetheless and The Doctor's respect was always important to Tom, even though he often showed a serious lack of interest in his duties in sickbay. Tom not only shared with him many personal stories, but also helped him explore one of the most difficult aspects of being a member of the crew: relationships. When The Doctor was rejected by Danara Pel, a Vidiian who he had developed feelings for, he went to Tom who told him that women want romance and a man to make an effort. He advised The Doctor to take her some place special and create the kind of atmosphere that would make her fall for him. (VOY: "Lifesigns") When The Doctor once created a holographic family and one of his "children" faced death, it was Paris who convinced him to keep running the program regardless of how painful, because that was real life. Realizing that The Doctor needed to experience the negative aspects of family life if he wanted to develop as a person, he encouraged him to embrace life from all aspects – including the uncomfortable and even painful ones. (VOY: "Real Life") Tom also once mocked The Doctor for giving Seven dating advice, stating that it was a typical case of "the blind leading the blind". He challenged him to get Seven a date and keep it from turning into a disaster. In return, he offered to work double shifts in sickbay for a month. If she failed, he would get a month off. The Doctor agreed to the wager, but when Seven found out, she was very upset and the whole thing blew off. (VOY: "Someone to Watch Over Me")

A holographic Tom shows his version of Photons Be Free to The Doctor
Over time, it became clear that although he complained about the role and tried everything to avoid having to show up in sickbay, preferring to pilot the ship instead, The Doctor's opinion of him was important to Tom. This was the main reason he resented The Doctor's holonovel about abused holograms, Photons Be Free; he worried that "his" character, a womanizer called Lieutenant Marseilles, reflected how The Doctor truly saw him, even though The Doctor denied that Marseilles' character was based on Tom. In order to make The Doctor understand the extent to which his portrayal of the characters on Voyager was painting them in a bad light, Tom went ahead and wrote an alternate version of The Doctor's holonovel. In that version, which took place on the USS Voyeur, the Emergency Medical Hologram was an incompetent, sleazy character who told bad jokes, had a lousy bedside manner and drugged his female patients so he could seduce them right there in sickbay. When The Doctor found out, he was rather outraged about this false portrayal of him, but eventually got the point Tom was trying to make and asked his publisher, Ardon Broht, to not publish the novel until he revised it. Broht, however, still went ahead and published it and when The Doctor demanded that all copies be recalled, Broht refused, based on grounds that The Doctor was a mere hologram and not a person with rights who could make demands. This resulted in a near legal battle over The Doctor's standing in which Captain Janeway and the rest of the crew came to his defense. Although Tuvok briefly contemplated arguing that, since The Doctor was not a real person, according to both Broht and Federation law, he would therefore have never had the right to sell the novel in the first place, Tom immediately objected, stating that making that argument was the equivalent of admitting that The Doctor was not a real person. This prompted Janeway to approach the defense of The Doctor from a different angle and the novel was recalled. (VOY: "Author, Author")

Neelix
Tom and Neelix during an altercation in the mess hall
At first, Tom and Neelix did not get along. Tom's reputation as a womanizer and his sordid past had preceded him and Neelix was weary of Tom's attraction to and subtle flirtations with Kes. Neelix did not trust him. Even though Paris never acted on it directly, his feelings towards Kes were quite obvious, such as the time when he used two weeks worth of replicator rations to get Kes a locket for her birthday. (VOY: " Twisted") Neelix was incredibly jealous, bordering at paranoia, when it came to Tom and Kes, until everything finally blew up one day when Tom was giving Kes flight lessons on the holodeck and then both were seen coming out laughing. This angered Neelix who believed that they were having a good time sneaking around behind his back. Later in the mess hall he confronted Paris, calling him a "subclass genus" for pretending he did not have any feelings for Kes. Tom reassured him that there was nothing going on but Neelix got riled up and dumped a plate full of hair pasta on Tom. Tom returned the favor and before they knew it, both were wrestling on the table, exchanging insults. 

When later both were assigned to an away mission and had to work things out on their own, Neelix apologized to Tom for having dumped the pasta on him, realizing that he was wrong. Tom admitted to being attracted to Kes, but at the same time also revealed that he respected Neelix too much to ever act on his feelings. He also told Neelix that even though everything he had heard from the other crew members about his past was true, it wasn't who he was anymore because this upside-down mission to the wrong side of the galaxy had given him a second chance which he did not intend to blow. This marked the end of Tom's and Neelix' contentions for one another and the beginning of their friendship. (VOY: "Parturition")

In fact, Neelix became so fond of Tom that when Tom revealed his intentions to leave the ship, Neelix, oblivious to Tom putting on an act to catch a traitor, became quite upset and began an investigation into the motives behind Paris' departure. He told Tom that he wished he didn't leave and later in an editorial for his show "A Briefing with Neelix", he praised Tom as an honest and courageous yet misunderstood man who was misjudged by his peers, stating that he would miss his dear new friend very much if he left the ship. When the traitor was finally revealed and Tom came back to the ship, Neelix was more than happy to see his friend return. (VOY: "Investigations") 

Neelix, The Doctor and Tom Paris playing a game in the mess hall
Tom's and Neelix' bond as friends grew stronger; they often played pool and other games, sat up into the late hours swapping stories, and even enjoyed kidding The Doctor every now and then. However, Tom could still not develop a palette for Neelix' cooking and complained often. (VOY: "Investigations", "Live Fast and Prosper") Neelix trusted Tom and, when in 2373 he got himself in some trouble by dealing with narcotics and then spiraled down by lying to cover up his lies, he turned to Tom, asking about his past. Paris told him that the reason he got in trouble in the first place was because instead of telling the truth, he kept lying – nearly ruining his life. Neelix did not tell Paris what he had done but the discussion helped him put things in perspective. (VOY: "Fair Trade")

When in 2377 Tom found out he was going to be a father, he said he could not imagine anyone more suited as his child's godfather than Neelix. Neelix was thrilled, even though that role eventually went to The Doctor because Neelix already had Naomi Wildman as a god-daughter. (VOY: "Lineage")

Chakotay
Tom and Chakotay knew each other when Tom had joined the Maquis after his disgraceful discharge from Starfleet. When Captain Janeway asked Tom to join her on Voyager's mission to retrieve Chakotay's Maquis ship, Tom confirmed Chakotay's assertion of him as an opportunist who'd be willing to sell out to anyone as long as the price was right. When Chakotay discovered him on Voyager's bridge after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant, he was angered, wondering what he had accepted this time when he betrayed them. This sentiment changed greatly when Tom saved Chakotay's life on Ocampa and when Captain Janeway asked him to respect Tom as a member of her crew. (VOY: "Caretaker")

Chakotay confronts Tom
The tension between Tom and Chakotay was later, rather clandestinely, exploited by Janeway and Tuvok who tried to expose a traitor on Voyager. Chakotay was in charge of ship personnel so Tom, unbeknownst to Chakotay, was ordered to show insubordination, tardiness and be regularly late for his duty shifts. When Chakotay confronted Tom, asking him why he was not taking his duties seriously and exhibited such bad behavior, Tom became physically confrontational with Chakotay, telling him that he was not the only person who had a problem with the way Chakotay was doing things. Even though their plan eventually helped them catch the traitor, Chakotay was led on for the longest time to believe that he and Tom had not resolved their differences; when later the truth came out, he couldn't help but feel fooled once again – especially after Seska's and Tuvok's previous deceptions; luckily after this brief episode he and Tom finally patched things up. (VOY: "Meld", "Lifesigns", "Investigations") Chakotay frequently addressed Tom by first name, implying a measure of affection.

Over the years, Chakotay's opinion of Tom changed greatly to one of respect and when in 2374 Tom began to once again act restless and erratic, Chakotay advised him to not ruin everything he had worked for in all these years. He reminded him that he was a different man than the one who came on board four years ago and that he was glad to have seen him take charge of his life and turn himself around. Tom reassured him that he was merely needing a change of pace and promised to not compromise everything he had worked for. (VOY: "Vis à Vis")

Tuvok
Paris and Tuvok had very different approaches and philosophies to life. While Tuvok viewed life through the lens of typical Vulcan logic, Paris had a more carefree attitude towards things; an attribute which irritated Tuvok a great deal and which often resulted in clashes between the two – sometimes serious, often humorous. One such clash became apparent when Tom was put in charge of writing an ending to Tuvok's Insurrection Alpha holoprogram depicting a Maquis mutiny on board Voyager. Tuvok was not happy that Tom was assigned to finish the novel, especially because Tom was disregarding all of his original organization and logical application by adhering to a more casual "make it up as I go along" format. Tom was suggesting that in the novel, Paris and Janeway retake the ship while Janeway decides to execute all the conspirators; an ending Tuvok believed to be a completely implausible plot development. (VOY: "Worst Case Scenario") On another occasion, Tuvok and Paris got into a disagreement over the built and look of the Delta Flyer: Tom had added fancy decoration, such as dynametric tailfins, to the nacelles which Tuvok promptly removed, stating that they were not designing a "hot rod" and that such embellishments were unnecessary. (VOY: "Extreme Risk")

Tom also often kidded Tuvok, trying to get him to loosen up a bit and "take it easy", such as the time he tried to get him to view the generational ship the Varro had built from more than just a logical and practical angle; or when he tried to find out Tuvok's age, which at that point had remained somewhat of a mystery to many. These attempts to elicit emotional responses out of Tuvok often proved fruitless, however, as Tuvok countered every point made with a logical response, leaving Paris frustrated even having tried. (VOY: "The Disease") Tom did not always appreciate Tuvok's by-the-book and rigid methods and once believed that Tuvok, who had earlier caught him and B'Elanna kissing in engineering, had reported the matter to Captain Janeway; a suspicion that proved to be wrong as Janeway assured Paris that Tuvok had done no such thing. (VOY: "Scientific Method") 

Despite occasional irritations, however, Tom and Tuvok maintained a cordial and respectful relationship with one another throughout their journey through the Delta Quadrant. Even early in their journey, Tuvok showed a surprising amount of faith in Tom, selecting Tom as the mole to identify a potential traitor who was leaking information to the Kazon when the plan would put Tom in a position where he could legitimately defect (VOY: "Investigations"), and making Tom the only other major crewmember – aside from Tuvok himself – who was unquestionably on Janeway's side during the Maquis mutiny in his Insurrection Alpha program (VOY: "Worst Case Scenario").

When Tom was charged with the murder of engineering physicist Tolen Ren in 2371, it was Tuvok's thorough investigation that lead to proving Tom's innocence in the matter. As a result, Tom felt a great sense of gratitude towards Tuvok for having saved his life. Even though Tuvok explained to him that he was merely performing his duty and would have put the same level of diligence into the investigation regardless of which crew member was charged, Tom did not care and told Tuvok that regardless of his motives, he had just made a friend that day (VOY: "Ex Post Facto"). 

When Tuvok was going through the pon farr while The Doctor was away and Tom the only medic available, Tom claimed to the rest of the crew that Tuvok was just suffering from Tarkalean flu, later programming a holographic replica of T'Pel to help Tuvok deal with his urges without betraying his wife (VOY: "Body and Soul").

When Tuvok, The Doctor and Paris were stranded on an inhospitable planet for a number of months, they met a young woman named Noss who began developing feelings for Tuvok. Unable to return her feelings and citing his marriage, Paris interjected – berating Tuvok for breaking Noss' heart, suggesting that he may reconsider his allegiance to his wife given that they are so far removed and may never make it back. Paris was genuinely interested in seeing Tuvok take a chance with someone new. After they were rescued, however, Paris apologized to Tuvok for what he had said, acknowledging that it was not up to him to make that call. (VOY: "Gravity")

Tom's respect for Tuvok never changed and when Tom learned of B'Elanna's pregnancy, he went to Tuvok for advice on fatherhood. Tuvok noted that Tom should expect the illogical combination of frustration and satisfaction that children could bring to a father's life (VOY: "Lineage").

Romance
Tom Paris was known as somewhat of a ladies' man and he was very cavalier when it came to women and dating. Lieutenant Stadi once asked him whether he always flew at women "at warp speed." (VOY: "Caretaker") During his time on Voyager, he programmed the women in his Chez Sandrine holoprogram to be equally permissive and the pool hustler he had created for that program lived by the motto of "treat a tramp like a lady and a lady like a tramp." (VOY: "The Cloud") When Paris first came on board the ship, he couldn't wait to get together with the Delaney sisters; he even tried to convince Harry Kim to go on a double date with him and the twins and he went so far as to lie about Harry's accomplishments so they would agree to go out with them. (VOY: "Time and Again") During their second year on board Voyager, he told Harry that he had been "chasing" Susan Nicoletti for at least six months but with no luck. (VOY: "The Thaw")

Before he became confident with women, Tom Paris had his share of heartbreaks and turn-downs. He recalled Alice Battisti from his time at the Academy, and how she wouldn't give him the time of day. (VOY: "Alice") He also once told The Doctor about his first heartbreak, Susie Crabtree, who broke up with him during his first year at the Academy. He recalled breaking out in hives, unable to get out of bed for a week while almost failing stellar cartography because of her; he eventually got over her, but "walked around in a daze" for the rest of that year and even today would think about her from time to time. He knew that the first one was always the hardest to get over. (VOY: "Lifesigns")

Trapped in the Delta Quadrant, Tom Paris' options were somewhat limited. He was attracted to Kes when she first joined the vessel's crew, but because she had a relationship with Neelix, Paris never really pursued her. As a Starfleet conn officer, he eventually became attracted to a former Maquis engineer with a fiery disposition that was tempered by a vulnerable side which he found very endearing. (VOY: "Elogium", "Parturition", "Alter Ego", "Blood Fever", "Day of Honor")

B'Elanna Torres
Tom and B'Elanna
In the beginning, Tom's and B'Elanna's interactions were cordial in nature and they didn't pay much attention to each other; in fact, B'Elanna once thought Tom to be a "pig" when she discovered the kind of chauvinistic holodeck character he had programmed. (VOY: " The Cloud") Despite shaky beginnings, however – and even though aboard Voyager Tom officially represented Starfleet while B'Elanna was an ex-Maquis – in a way, they were kindred spirits: they were outlaws and misfits in their respective lives in the Alpha Quadrant and they both had rather difficult and wounding relationships with their parents. As a result, they had a hard time playing by the rules and often felt that they did not fit in. (VOY: "Caretaker", "Parallax", "Thirty Days", "Day of Honor", "Hunters", "Extreme Risk") As time went by, they began warming up to each other and Tom gradually approached her and began seeing her in a romantic light. Their first real flirtation occurred in 2373 during an away mission on a shuttlecraft when Tom asked B'Elanna if she had a "hot date" back on Voyager. When she denied any interest in the attentions of Crewman Freddy Bristow, Tom suggested that she might join him on the holodeck sometime, wondering how a Klingon could "live the life of a nun" anyway. B'Elanna, aware of Tom's reputation as a ladies' man, turned him down flat. (VOY: "The Swarm")

Tom and B'Elanna's first kiss
Tom showed a hint of jealousy when B'Elanna had once agreed to have dinner with Ensign Vorik during a Luau celebration on the holodeck. (VOY: "Alter Ego") 

Their relationship began seriously heating up later that year when Vorik, struck with the pon farr, asked B'Elanna to become his mate. Even though she turned him down, in his passion, Vorik took her face in his hands and unintentionally initiated a telepathic mating bond. Later, on an away mission, when B'Elanna was trapped with Paris in a cave on a planet and heavily under the influence of the blood fever, her instincts finally took over and she began initiating a mating ritual with Tom. They finally kissed, but Paris regained his wits, realizing that her judgment was impaired and that he would hate himself if he took advantage of her while she was in such a compromised state of mind. B'Elanna confessed that she had noticed Tom's interest in her a long time ago with all those invitations to dinner, the way he would look at her when he thought she wasn't looking and get jealous when she was with someone else. Tom admitted to being attracted to her but he also knew this wasn't really her, and remained adamant that he would not misuse the situation. When Tuvok finally rescued them, he told Tom that unless he mated with B'Elanna, she would die from the pon farr-like symptoms. He was ready to accede to B'Elanna's wishes when Vorik interrupted them to claim her for himself. Ultimately, Torres and Vorik fought to end the pon farr. Later, in the turbolift, B'Elanna told Paris that they should forget the whole thing, but he insisted that even though he had seen her "big scary Klingon side", he was still interested. Her last words as she departed the turbolift were to be careful what he wishes for. (VOY: "Blood Fever")

In an alternate future, Paris and B'Elanna again appeared as a couple when Kes began to live her life backwards, although B'Elanna died in an attack shortly after Kes' appearance in that timeline. When she finally stabilized in 2373, it was obvious that Tom and B'Elanna were still just friends. (VOY: "Before and After")

When the entire crew lost Voyager to a race known as the Nyrians, they became stranded on a spacecraft with prison cells simulated to be environments suitable for the prisoners. In an attempt to escape, Paris and Torres became trapped in an "ice age" scenario and were forced to embrace each other to stimulate warmth. (VOY: "Displaced")

It became obvious that they were growing closer when they shared an illicit holoprogram that B'Elanna found depicting a Maquis mutiny on Voyager. When Tom was given the OK to write an ending for it, B'Elanna suggested adding some passion to the plot. Tom replied that he could certainly add "a steamy love scene" between the Starfleet conn officer and Maquis engineer; a suggestion which B'Elanna casually dismissed as unrealistic. (VOY: "Worst Case Scenario")

B'Elanna's insecurities and her troubled past finally got a hold of her, however, and lead her to withdraw quite a great deal when she and Tom first became close. Tom, who had begun to develop feelings for B'Elanna, often found new ways to spend time with her; he even began to work Klingon martial arts programs with her on the holodeck, even though she was not impressed by the scenarios. Despite her anger issues and strong temper, he remained supportive, patient and engaged. He often encouraged her to embrace her Klingon side such as the time when he asked her whether she had considered to go through with the rituals associated with the Klingon Day of Honor. B'Elanna remained reserved and angry, however, and even though he helped her create the holographic simulation of the ritual, she continued pushing him away, asking to be left alone. A frustrated Tom finally told her that not only was she running away from herself, but that if she kept pushing away those who cared about her, she would indeed be alone all her life. This struck a chord with B'Elanna who, for the first time, recognized the extent to which her constant anger was causing people to want to run for the nearest airlock. (VOY: "Day of Honor")

While later during an away mission they were both stranded in space, floating in their EV suits, running out of oxygen, their true feelings for each other finally surfaced and B'Elanna admitted to being in love with Tom. (VOY: "Day of Honor") A few days after the incident, they began a romantic relationship. (VOY: "Revulsion")

Tom and B'Elanna about to get caught by Tuvok
At the beginning of their relationship, they often sneaked around the ship to meet up. Although at that time their liaison was passionate, they were not sure if it would have a future. Paris often made up excuses to end his duty shift sooner to be with B'Elanna. He even used the transporter to get to her without being seen by other crew members. Eventually, they were caught by Tuvok when they met on the upper deck of main engineering. After that, Tom and B'Elanna were worried that their relationship would be known among the entire Voyager crew. Trying not to raise any suspicion, they once even went so far as to not enter the briefing room at the same time. Tuvok never had mentioned that he caught both of them to Captain Kathryn Janeway, but she eventually found out and reprimanded them for their childish and unprofessional behavior and warned that they were under orders to use better judgment about it as senior officers. (VOY: "Scientific Method")

Just married
Their relationship also had a somewhat volatile nature and their disagreements were often passionate. B'Elanna was certainly not the only one withholding: at one point into their relationship, Tom's restlessness caused him to cancel their dates, forget about planned get-aways, and spend lots of time on the holodeck fixing cars. When she confronted him, a short-tempered Tom replied that nothing was going on, snapping back that he didn't need to report every moment that he wasn't spending with her to her, causing B'Elanna to storm out in anger. (VOY: "Vis à Vis", "Drive") 

Despite his patience and willingness to see past her shortcomings, Tom was not always immune to B'Elanna's emotional outbursts and anger and on occasion did express his frustration with her temper, such as the time when he sardonically accused her of apparently only having fun when Klingon pain sticks were involved and that she was being angry twenty-four hours a day. He was also weary of her rather direct and confrontational approach to people and had to hold her back sometime from going too far, such as the time when B'Elanna threatened to break Seven of Nine's nose when she discovered that she was spying on them for educational purposes. (VOY: "Night", "Someone to Watch Over Me") Complications in their relationship lead B'Elanna to consider ending it because she wondered if they really belonged together and realized that merely having a good time occasionally was not enough for her. Tom, however, reaffirmed his love and desire of wanting to be with her and in 2377 they were married. (VOY: "Drive") In 2378, en route a turbulent trip back to Earth, their daughter Miral was born. (VOY: "Endgame")

Kes
Tom and Kes flirting in 2372
Kes was one of Tom's first romantic interests on board Voyager and as her role in the crew developed, so did Paris' feelings for her; in an alternate future, he admitted that he'd had a crush on her from the moment she joined the crew. (VOY: "Before and After") Neelix once said that it was typical of Kes to befriend an outsider like Tom; someone who could really use a friend. (VOY: "Parturition")

Tom's attraction to Kes was no secret and he did go out of his way to spend time with her and make her feel special. He often helped her in the airponics bay and mess hall and he even began giving her flying lessons on the holodeck. He also once sacrificed two weeks worth of replicator rations to give her a beautiful locket as a present for her birthday. He confessed to Harry that he was in love with her, wondering why with a crew full of women, he had to fall for the one he couldn't have. Kim responded that the reason he was acting this way was probably because all his life, he had been used to setting himself up for rejection. Tom's intent to stay away from Kes proved hopeless, however, and his actions left Neelix bursting with jealousy, culminating in a physical altercation between the two in the mess hall. The two were able to resolve their differences after saving an alien infant together and bonding over the experience. Tom also admitted to Neelix that while he did have feelings for Kes, he never actually intended to act on them as he respected Neelix too much. (VOY: "Twisted", "Parturition") When Paris left the ship as part of a ploy to expose a Kazon spy, Kes was one of the three people who came to say goodbye to him directly, the other two being Neelix and Harry Kim. (VOY: "Investigations")

Tom and Kes in an alternate timeline
During their third year serving together, Tom's feelings began to shift from Kes to B'Elanna. (VOY: "Blood Fever", "Alter Ego", "Displaced") Although Tom and Kes married in an alternate future during the "Year of Hell" conflict, this only occurred following B'Elanna's death in the first stage of the conflict; Kes and Paris went on to have a daughter, Linnis Paris, who married Harry Kim and had a son called Andrew Kim. This timeline was erased when exposure to temporal radiation sent Kes traveling back in time from the moment of her death until she stabilized at a point prior to B'Elanna's death (VOY: "Before and After"), and any feelings she may have developed for Paris in the course of her jumps were never fully explored before she finally departed the ship on her journey of self-discovery. (VOY: "The Gift", "Fury")

Recreations of crew members from Voyager and the Jupiter Station Holoprogramming Center were seen by The Doctor during a holographic malfunction in 2371. This simulation included Tom. In the illusion, Reginald Barclay told The Doctor that he had programmed the holograms and had modeled Tom after his cousin Frank. (VOY: "Projections")
The entire crew of Voyager was recreated by Tuvok from his Insurrection Alpha program, with Tom's character departing Voyager with Janeway on a diplomatic mission shortly before the mutiny began. (VOY: "Worst Case Scenario")
The Kyrian Museum of Heritage in the 31st century used the program The Voyager Encounter to detail their encounter with the warship Voyager, as an aid to a history lesson. A backup of The Doctor remarked that Tom was the only crewmate of his whose portrayal in the biased and wildly inaccurate holoprogram was even slightly accurate. (VOY: "Living Witness")
Lt. Barclay's recreated most of the crew of USS Voyager at the Communications Research Center on Earth for the Pathfinder Project in 2376. (VOY: "Pathfinder")
In 2378, Seven recreated the crew of Voyager to perfect her social skills, including Tom. (VOY: "Human Error")
The Doctor's holonovel, Photons Be Free, was set aboard the USS Vortex and crewed by characters based on the crew of USS Voyager, although the names were changed to protect the innocent. The character of Marseilles was based on Paris. When Tom found out about this he "revised" the story, making himself the new narrator and changing the ship to the USS Voyeur. (VOY: "Author, Author")
Alternate realities and timelines
In an alternate timeline, for his first official away mission, Tom Paris joined Kathryn Janeway, B'Elanna Torres, and Tuvok on a planet devastated by the detonation of a polaric ion device. Due to a subspace fracture, he and Janeway were pulled back in time prior to the detonation. They were taken hostage by protesters demonstrating against the use of polaric energy. When being escorted to a polaric power plant, along with a boy named Latika, Janeway told a guard that she and Paris were hostages. One of the protesters went to shoot at Latika, but Paris took the bullet. (VOY: "Time and Again")
When Kim mistakenly entered an alternate reality in which he was never assigned to Voyager, Paris helped him return to his own reality. In that timeline, when he arrived at Deep Space 9, Paris got into a bar fight with Quark and was sent to the brig by Constable Odo, forcing Voyager to leave without him. Having served his sentence at a penal colony, Paris moved to Marseilles where he spent his time at Sandrine's drinking and hustling pool. He did not know Kim, but nevertheless helped him return to his own timeline at the cost of his life, as the runabout they were on was destroyed while they attempted to duplicate the accident that sent Kim to this reality. (VOY: "Non Sequitur")
Paris in an alternate timeline, retired from Starfleet
In another alternate timeline experienced by Kes traveling back through time, Paris married and had a child with Kes, named Linnis Paris, following Torres' death during the "Year of Hell" conflict in 2374. Linnis went on to marry Harry Kim, and the two of them had a son called Andrew. Paris had also seemed to attain the rank of Lt. Commander, evidenced by three pips on his collar. He was also seen wearing a command division uniform, indicating that he might have been chosen by Chakotay to be his First Officer over Second Officer Tuvok, who still wore an operations division uniform. In this timeline, Kes was experiencing time jumps that were taking her back in time, caused by her contamination from the Krenim's temporal weapons, and was subsequently erased when The Doctor cured Kes of the contamination. Any feelings Kes had for Paris as a result of the experience were never explored before her departure. (VOY: "Before and After")
Paris, dead on a Class L planet
In the alternate timeline in which Voyager crashed on an L-Class world in the Alpha Quadrant after an accident with an experimental quantum slipstream drive, Paris died upon impact, along with the rest of the crew, save Harry Kim and Chakotay, who were aboard the Delta Flyer, and The Doctor, who was merely deactivated. (VOY: "Timeless")
In an alternate timeline in which it took Voyager sixteen more years to return to Earth, Paris retired from Starfleet and became a holonovelist. He and The Doctor retained their typical bantering relationship, with Paris teasing The Doctor about the fact that it took him thirty-three years to choose the name 'Joe'. (VOY: "Endgame")

Background information
Tom Paris was played by Robert Duncan McNeill throughout the entire run of Star Trek: Voyager. In the episode "Vis à Vis", he was also played by Dan Butler, after exchanging bodies with the "Steth" impostor. The young Paris in "Thirty Days" was played by Randy Riener.

Tom Paris' character was largely based on the character of Nicholas Locarno from The Next Generation episode "The First Duty", who was also played by Robert Duncan McNeill.  In interviews the producers of Voyager have said they felt Locarno's actions in that episode made him "irredeemable". (TNG Season 5 DVD-special features, Memorable Missions Year Five:"The First Duty") Later, a photo of McNeill as Locarno was used as a photo of young Tom Paris on Admiral Paris's desk in the episode "Pathfinder".

In the script of "Caretaker", Tom Paris was initially described as "an athletic Human in his late twenties." The first draft of the "Caretaker" script also referred to him as wearing an operations division uniform, rather than a command division one.

Tom Paris was written into the first half-dozen or so Star Trek: Voyager scripts with little or no knowledge as to who would play the part. These episodes included "Ex Post Facto", which centrally features the character. (Star Trek: Voyager - A Vision of the Future, p. 174)

Robert Duncan McNeill as Nicholas Locarno in The Next Generation
When the producers were trying to cast the role of Tom Paris, they couldn't find anyone that seemed to match Robert Duncan McNeill's persona, so they eventually just asked him to read for the role, and he got the part. The producers at the time wanted him to bring some of the same edginess and qualities he had brought to Nick Locarno, to the character of Tom Paris, with the difference that Paris' character would be redeemable. McNeill explained, "Locarno seemed like a nice guy, but deep down he was a bad guy. Tom Paris is an opposite premise in a way. Deep down he's a good guy. He's just made some mistakes." He went on to say, "Star Trek, in a way, is like Shakespeare. We say what we mean. One of the things that makes Tom Paris unique is that he uses plain English when everyone else is talking technobabble. He cuts to the chase. He's a red-blooded, all-American kind of guy. I like that."  Some early notes for Voyager actually referred to the character as "Locarno," before the producers decided that the character had too much baggage and was too compromised. They then issued a casting call, assuming they would need a new actor, and issued a casting call for a "Robert Duncan McNeill type." McNeill himself heard of the role and was confused, that surely nobody was more of a Robert Duncan McNeill type than himself. He sent an audition to Los Angeles and was asked by the producers to come to Hollywood for a full audition, and was cast the same day. (Star Trek Voyager: A Celebration, p. 55)

Paris' middle name, "Eugene", is a tribute to Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry. (Star Trek Encyclopedia (4th ed., vol. 2, p. 125))

When Paris was promoted to lieutenant at the end of "Caretaker", he was described in the episode's first draft script as receiving the rank pips of a full lieutenant. He was not only shown that way in the final version of that episode but also wore the lieutenant pips for several subsequent episodes. However, as of the episode "Faces", this costume gaffe was corrected to reflect Paris' actual rank of lieutenant junior grade.

In the It's A Wrap! sale and auction, two uniforms used by McNeill in his portrayal of Tom Paris that were up for auction contained pectorals to show increased musculature. The usage of this is unknown, although a racquetball uniform used by Alexander Siddig as Julian Bashir had muscle padding as well.    

The cast of the film Star Trek Beyond includes a character named Commodore Paris, in command of Starbase Yorktown; Simon Pegg confirmed that her name is a reference to Tom Paris, suggesting that she is the alternate reality counterpart to Tom's grandmother. 

Apocrypha
In the Pocket VOY novel Pathways, Paris has two older sisters, named Kathleen and Moira. Moira is described as having dark hair and blue eyes. She was studying to be a doctor while Tom was at the Academy.

An unproduced Voyager script was to included a flashback to his time at Starfleet Academy, which would've revealed that one of his classmates was Ro Laren.

In the Voyager relaunch book series, Paris moved to Boreth with his wife and daughter to help B'Elanna find her mother. He later rejoined the crew of the USS Voyager under the command of Captain Chakotay and was promoted to Lieutenant commander. He served as Voyager's first officer after the original first officer was revealed to be a renegade Changeling. He continued to serve in that capacity after the Borg Invasion of 2381 – the same year he also got word of his father's death at Starbase 234, joining Voyager in its return to the Delta Quadrant via the new quantum slipstream drive as part of 'Project Full Circle'. In A Pocket Full of Lies, B'Elanna gives birth to her and Tom's second child, their son Michael Owen Paris. 

In the alternate future of the Deep Space Nine Millennium book trilogy, Paris and the rest of the Voyager crew returned to the Alpha Quadrant at an unspecified time. He was married to B'Elanna Torres and both were later assigned to the USS Enterprise-F under Captain William T. Riker. Paris, along with the Enterprise and her crew (including Deanna Troi and Geordi La Forge), was killed during the destruction of Earth in 2388. 

In the Star Trek: Stargazer series of novels written by Michael Jan Friedman, there is an officer on the USS Stargazer under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard named Cole Paris. He eventually began a "relationship" with a fellow crewmember, a non-corporeal entity, after an encounter in her quarters in her gaseous state left him with an incredible feeling; he acknowledged from the beginning that it wouldn't be easy, but he wanted to try and make it work. Cole was Owen's brother, and, hence, Tom's uncle.

An earlier Paris ancestor, Iron Mike Paris, appeared in the Star Trek: The Lost Era novel Serpents Among the Ruins by David R. George III. According to this book, Mike was the father of Owen and Cole and therefore Tom's paternal grandfather.

His mirror universe counterpart (β) was depicted as a sex slave of B'Elanna, the half-Klingon, half-Terran Supervisor of Ardana, in the novel The Mirror-Scaled Serpent.

Tom Paris appears in Season 10 of Star Trek Online, voiced by Robert Duncan McNeill. In the game, set about 30 years after Voyager's return to Earth, Paris is still in Starfleet, serving as the captain of the USS Mercury, a fast escort ship as befitting a former helmsman. Dialogue by Fleet Admiral Jorel Quinn in a short story published on the Star Trek Online website suggests that Paris may have once been an admiral himself, but voluntarily took a demotion to captain to serve in the field (similarly to James T. Kirk accepting the same to command the Enterprise again in Star Trek: The Motion Picture). He leads a task force called "Delta Flight", made up of the best pilots from Starfleet, the Klingon Defense Force, and the Romulan Republican Forces, and aids the player in defending the Milky Way galaxy from invasion by the Iconians and their Herald servants.

According to The Autobiography of Kathryn Janeway, Tom and B'Elanna had a second child named Eugene Owen Paris.
