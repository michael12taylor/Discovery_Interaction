Childhood
Sisko's, owned by Benjamin's father
Sisko was born in 2332 in New Orleans, North America, Earth, to Joseph and Sarah Sisko. Sarah, however, had been possessed by a Prophet – a non-linear alien species which lived in the then-undiscovered Bajoran wormhole – in order to ensure the birth of Benjamin, who would later become the Emissary of the Prophets. 

A year later, the Prophet returned control of Sarah's body, and she soon left her son and husband. Joseph soon remarried, and his new wife raised Benjamin as her own. (DS9: "Image in the Sand") She later gave birth to his younger half-sister Judith and two half-brothers. (DS9: "Past Tense, Part I", "Homefront", "Paradise")

During his childhood, Sisko and his siblings were taught to cook by their father, who believed that replicated food was lacking. Joseph owned his own restaurant, Sisko's Creole Kitchen, where his children worked in the summers. (DS9: "Homefront") Joseph called his children his "taste-testers", and insisted that they all eat dinner together. (DS9: "A Man Alone") He also grew his own vegetables and would send his sons out to the garden to pick them. (DS9: "Paradise")

As a teenager, Sisko had a crush on Neffie Beumont and later dated Zoey Phillips for three years. (DS9: "Paradise Lost")

Starfleet Academy
Sisko joined Starfleet Academy in 2350, where he studied to be an engineer. During his first week there, he became homesick to where he would beam back home to New Orleans every night for dinner with his family, but he eventually got over his homesickness. (DS9: "Explorers", "Homefront", "Paradise Lost") 

During his sophomore year, he performed his field study at Starbase 137. He later considered it to be one of the best experiences of his life. (DS9: "The Ascent")

During his years at the Academy, Ben became friends with Calvin Hudson and Laporin. (DS9: "The Maquis, Part I", "The Maquis, Part II", "Apocalypse Rising") 

Sisko also became the captain of his Academy wrestling team in 2351. (DS9: "Q-Less", "Apocalypse Rising") He once challenged a Vulcan, Solok, to a match after a few drinks in The Launching Pad. Already impaired with alcohol against an opponent three times stronger than himself, he lost, was humiliated, and resented Solok for decades. (DS9: "Take Me Out to the Holosuite")

On their graduation day from the Academy – the first day they donned their officers' uniforms – Sisko and Hudson both swore that they would be starship captains by the time they were thirty, and admirals by forty. (DS9: "The Maquis, Part II") Sisko did not, in fact, attain rank of captain until he was thirty-nine, the same year he also became a starship commander. (DS9: "The Search, Part I", "The Adversary")

Early career
Early postings
Sisko meets Jennifer at Gilgo Beach in 2354
After graduation in 2354, while waiting for his first assignment, Benjamin met a woman named Jennifer at Gilgo Beach. As the year pressed on, the two fell in love, were married and moved to Benjamin's new posting at New Berlin. Together with Cal and Gretchen Hudson, they attended the local Mazurka Festival where Benjamin was remembered for dancing in lederhosen. (DS9: "Emissary", "The Maquis, Part I")

While he was still "a raw young ensign", Sisko first met Curzon Dax at Pelios Station, and thereafter, Curzon took Sisko "under his wing" and became the young officer's mentor. Years later, Sisko recalled that Curzon "taught me to appreciate life in ways I'd never thought about before. He taught me about art and science and diplomacy," adding that "whatever sense of honor I might have today, he nurtured." (DS9: "Dax") 

Curzon's next host, Jadzia Dax would recall in 2371 during the construction of Sisko's lightship that the last time she had seen Sisko so excited and caught up in something was when the Siskos decided to have a baby, and he busied himself with creating a nursery for their future child which turned out well, including a starscape on the ceiling. The child, Jake, would be born in 2355. (DS9: "Explorers")

Sisko affectionately dubbed Curzon Dax "Old Man", and continued to use the name for both Jadzia and later Ezri. 

Later in their careers together, Jadzia once reminsced in 2374, "whatever happened to that young, callow ensign I used to know? The one who used to turn to me for advice all the time? You know, the one with hair?" His response was "I grew up." (DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited") 

The following year, Ezri Dax told Kira Nerys to remind her to tell the story about a drunken ensign she once escorted home, specifically, following a visit to "a bar on Bolarus and a certain young Mister Sisko." (DS9: "Field of Fire")

Curzon had to deal with Sisko's temper at times, including when Sisko was in an argument with an Argosian lieutenant, during which a drink was thrown in his face. Sisko intended to finish the fight, but Curzon held him back, eventually punching him in the jaw just to restrain him. He wore a ring which left a scar he held for many years later. (DS9: "Dax")

As Sisko continued to serve with Curzon, he later recalled how his mentor "used to take perverse pleasure in assigning me to take care of VIP guests." According to Sisko, he "graduated" from those assignments after he hit one of the guests, during "a simple misunderstanding over [the VIP's] attempt to coax a young female ensign to his quarters against her will." (DS9: "The Forsaken")

Further among their adventures was the time they were cornered by a party of hostile Kaleans on Rochani III. (DS9: "Dramatis Personae")

Following his promotion to Lieutenant, Sisko later recalled, "it took me a while to get used to being called "sir" by my friends who were still ensigns." (DS9: "Accession")

During the late 2350s, Sisko and Dax served together for many months aboard the USS Livingston, along with another well-remembered officer named Kustanovich. (DS9: "Invasive Procedures")

Sisko later served on the USS Okinawa during the Tzenkethi War. (DS9: "The Adversary") At the time, he was more interested in engineering and ship design than command. However, Captain Leyton noticed potential in young Sisko, and promoted him to lieutenant commander, making him the ship's executive officer. Leyton later recalled Sisko's being "a damn fine [executive officer]." (DS9: "Homefront", "Paradise Lost")

During one encounter with three Tzenkethi raiders, while aboard the Okinawa, the enemy vessels fled into a nearby asteroid belt. Commander Sisko told Captain Leyton it was risky to pursue them, but was overruled by his commanding officer. Years later, Sisko admitted that going after the Tzenkethi was the right thing to do. (DS9: "Paradise Lost")

Wolf 359
Massacre by the Borg
Sisko later transferred to the USS Saratoga, where he also served as the first officer. Both Jennifer and Jake lived with him aboard the vessel.

In early 2367, the ship was operating close to Earth, and was called to join a fleet at Wolf 359 to defend the Sol system from a Borg attack. The Battle of Wolf 359 became a disaster for Starfleet, with thirty-nine of the forty starships assembled there destroyed. The Borg damaged the Saratoga, forcing the crew to abandon ship. Sisko found his son and wife, but his wife had been killed in the attack. He was forced to leave her as the ship suffered a warp core breach. 

As late as 2369, Sisko blamed Jennifer's death on Jean-Luc Picard, who had been assimilated by the Borg as Locutus of Borg and had carried out the massacre at Wolf 359. (DS9: "Emissary")

Recovery
Sisko watches as the Borg destroy the Saratoga
Sisko was faced with the loss of his wife and raising his son alone. This left Sisko on the verge of resigning his commission. He intended to work on Earth, constructing orbital habitats, but struggled with the decision to leave. (DS9: "The Way of the Warrior") 

He eventually found an outlet for his pain in a new posting at Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards on Mars. (DS9: "Emissary") There, Sisko worked on the prototype USS Defiant – the first in what was to be a fleet of warships to defend the Federation from the Borg. After work on the project slowed, and design flaws became apparent, the project was mothballed. (DS9: "The Search, Part I", "Defiant") It was also around this time, in 2367, that Sisko attended a Starfleet briefing on Q. (DS9: "Q-Less")

As he was contemplating his next move, his former captain, Leyton, nominated Sisko for a command position. Promoted to commander, he was assigned to Bajor, original home to the Prophets who had caused his birth. There, Sisko was to command the old ore processing station Terok Nor, built by the Cardassians during their Occupation of Bajor, then abandoned as part of their recent withdrawal from the system. Under Federation control, the station was newly christened Deep Space 9. It was to be Sisko's responsibility to help prepare the Bajorans for entry into the Federation.

Sisko is briefed by Captain Picard
Arriving on DS9 in early 2369, Sisko was briefed by Jean-Luc Picard, whom he still blamed for his wife's death. At this point, Sisko told Picard he intended to resign and that Starfleet should probably look for a replacement. However, for the time being, he continued his work, and assumed command of the station. Sisko's crew slowly arrived, and it was then that he met his future friends, Bajoran liaison and second-in-command Kira Nerys, security chief Odo, Doctor Julian Bashir, and Chief of Operations Miles O'Brien. He was also reunited with his old friend Dax, living in a new host, Jadzia.

The situation on Bajor was hostile, as factions vied for control in the new Bajoran Provisional Government. Sisko learned that the only way to unite them all was to call on the Bajoran spiritual leader, Kai Opaka. Sisko met with her in a secluded area of Bajor, and she told him that he was to be the Emissary of the Prophets and was destined to discover the Celestial Temple, home of the Prophets. 

Sisko returned to the station and with the help of Dax, began studying everything known about the Celestial Temple. Eventually, they discovered an unusual area in the Denorios belt. Traveling there, they were surprised to discover a stable wormhole. Dax was sent home by the Prophets, but they met Sisko, who explained linear existence to them. 

While talking with the Prophets, Sisko realised he was resigning from Starfleet in a futile attempt to escape the pain he felt after his wife's death and he was forced to come to terms with her death rather than running from it. He returned to Deep Space 9, forgave Picard for his actions as Locutus, and informed him that he would stay in Starfleet. Sisko now had the difficult task of commanding a station with a large Bajoran staff, many of whom revered him as a religious figure – their prophesied Emissary. (DS9: "Emissary", "The Way of the Warrior")

Over time, Sisko and his son Jake came to view the "Cardassian monstrosity" that was Deep Space 9 as home. (DS9: "The Search, Part I")

Deep Space 9
As commander of Deep Space 9, Sisko could be somewhat unorthodox in his methods. He employed blackmail and extortion - and, early on, even physical violence - on some of the inhabitants of the station when he thought they needed persuading to do something for the benefit of the station or other inhabitants. He turned a blind eye to some of the questionable things people did on the station, too, including those by his staff, whether or not he agreed with what they were doing. When he didn't agree with an order from Starfleet, sometimes he kept to the letter of the order but worked around it if he thought there was a better approach. All of this was done because he took his job seriously, however, recognising the importance of a vibrant space station for the protection of Bajor, and valued his staff. While sometimes at odds with his superiors, he believed in Starfleet and his uniform. (DS9: "Emissary", "Captive Pursuit", "The Siege", "Paradise", "Blood Oath", and more)

Life on the frontier
Deep Space 9's position at the mouth of the Bajoran wormhole made it a key location. Exploration and business opportunities were opened to the distant Gamma Quadrant, and DS9 became a wayport for ships and people from all over the quadrant. Sisko began encouraging Bajorans and merchants on the Promenade to stay on the station, in order to shape DS9 into a thriving community. (DS9: "Emissary") He even approved the formation of a school on the station. (DS9: "A Man Alone")

Station Deep Space 9
Sisko had to put all his training and skills to use, as he was forced to balance command, diplomacy, his home life, and his new position as a Bajoran religious icon. Sisko made first contact with the first species to come through the wormhole from the Gamma Quadrant, the Tosk, in 2369. (DS9: "Captive Pursuit") He acted as defense in the extradition trial of Dax to the Klaestron government, and proved her innocent. (DS9: "Dax") He fought in the war between the Ennis and the Nol-Ennis on the planet where Kai Opaka was stranded. (DS9: "Battle Lines") Constantly dealing with Jake's friendship with a Ferengi boy, Nog, proved to be a challenge. (DS9: "A Man Alone", "The Nagus") But his most difficult tasks were preparing Bajor for life in the Federation, and dealing with his title as the Emissary.

During late 2369, tensions on the station rose between Bajoran and Starfleet personnel. Scientific teachings about the nature of the Bajoran wormhole conflicted with the religious beliefs of much of the Bajoran population. Sisko struggled to keep the peace, and in the process had his first meeting with Vedek Winn Adami. (DS9: "In the Hands of the Prophets")

Months later, internal pressures on Bajor exploded. A terrorist group called the Alliance for Global Unity – also known as the "Circle" – tried to seize power, under disguised support from the Cardassian Union, and sought to break off relations with the Federation. Starfleet was forced to abandon the station, but Sisko stayed behind, eventually proving the Cardassians' involvement with the Circle, which allowed power to quickly return to the Bajoran Provisional Government. (DS9: "The Homecoming", "The Circle", "The Siege")

The Maquis
Sisko was also forced to deal with internal pressures within the Federation as well. When the Federation-Cardassian Treaty of 2370 caused several colonies in Federation space to come under Cardassian rule, many colonists felt the Federation had abandoned them. They formed the Maquis, a terrorist group operating out of the Badlands. Sisko's old friend Calvin Hudson was assigned as the Starfleet attaché to the colonists in the Demilitarized Zone but became a Maquis leader. Several other Starfleet officers resigned to take up the Maquis cause. Sisko felt angered by the actions of these officers, and felt the pain of personal betrayal by Cal Hudson. (DS9: "The Maquis, Part I", "The Maquis, Part II")

Michael Eddington
The Maquis continued their private war for the next three years, and gained more support among Federation citizens. Deep Space 9's chief of Starfleet security, Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, and a woman with whom Sisko had become involved, Kasidy Yates, began to aid the Maquis in their activities. When Sisko discovered this, he felt betrayed by both people. He was forced to arrest Yates, but Eddington escaped. Sisko felt that Eddington had betrayed his oath to Starfleet the same way Cal Hudson had and vowed to capture him. (DS9: "For the Cause")

After eight months of tracking Eddington unsuccessfully, Starfleet took Sisko off the mission. However, he had become obsessed with finding his former officer, and continued his work to bring Eddington to justice. Sisko managed to force Eddington to surrender after he poisoned Solosos III, threatening to wage a campaign to poison every Maquis colony in the Demilitarized Zone. (DS9: "For the Uniform")

Several months later, Sisko and Eddington were involved in attempting to prevent a force of cloaked missiles from reaching Cardassia, launched by the Maquis as retaliation for their losses to the Dominion. The missiles were a ruse, however, propagated by Rebecca Sullivan in order to let Eddington know that the Maquis survivors had reached Athos IV for evacuation. Sisko was able to get the Maquis off the planet in a runabout despite coming under fire from the Jem'Hadar. (DS9: "Blaze of Glory")

Contact with the Dominion
In late 2370, Sisko made first contact with the Dominion in an encounter with the Jem'Hadar. This launched Sisko on a path that would define his career. The Dominion declared the Gamma Quadrant off-limits to Alpha Quadrant species, and destroyed several Starfleet ships, along with the colony on New Bajor. Sisko returned to DS9 with the realization that he had discovered a powerful and dangerous new enemy. (DS9: "The Jem'Hadar")

Sisko returned to Earth to brief Starfleet on the Dominion situation. Realizing that Deep Space 9 was to be the first line of defense from a Dominion attack, Sisko convinced Starfleet Command to finish work on the mothballed USS Defiant. Sisko returned to DS9 with the new warship, and entered the Gamma Quadrant on a mission to find the Founders. (DS9: "The Search, Part I") During the mission, the Defiant and crew were captured by the Jem'Hadar and placed in a simulation, testing their reaction to a Dominion incursion in the Alpha Quadrant. It was discovered that the Founders were in fact Changelings, the same species as Sisko's security chief, Odo. Odo forced the Founders to release the Defiant crew, and they returned to the station. (DS9: "The Search, Part II") Based on his experiences with the Dominion, Sisko's psychological evaluation became required knowledge for Vorta operatives in the Dominion. (DS9: "To the Death")

Sisko's promotion was celebrated in late 2371
Following three years of commanding Deep Space 9, Sisko was given a promotion, finally attaining the rank of captain in late 2371. Soon afterward, Sisko discovered that the Founders had begun infiltrating the Federation, posing as high-ranking officials. One Founder, disguised as an ambassador, ordered Sisko on a mission to the Tzenkethi border, and then tried to provoke a new Tzenkethi war. Sisko and crew were successful in stopping the Founder's attempt, but it became apparent that there were now Changeling infiltrators throughout the Alpha Quadrant. (DS9: "The Adversary")

Rising pressures
Fears of Dominion infiltration swept the quadrant, and when the Cardassian government was overthrown by the civilian Detapa Council in 2372, the Klingon Empire feared Changeling involvement. A large Klingon task force docked at Deep Space 9, bound for Cardassian space. Klingon Chancellor Gowron asked Sisko for Starfleet's help in invading Cardassia Prime. Sisko rejected their call for help, and the Klingons withdrew from the Khitomer Accords, ending decades of peace. Sisko now had to help the new Cardassian government survive the Klingon attack. He contacted his long-time adversary, Gul Dukat, and arranged to rescue him and the new Council. He made sure, however, to test the members for possible Changeling impostors. Sisko then faced a Klingon fleet in the First Battle of Deep Space 9 until Starfleet reinforcements were imminent. Faced with a war on two sides, the Klingons backed down. However, the balance of power in the Alpha Quadrant was changing, which played right into the Dominion's hands. (DS9: "The Way of the Warrior")

Leyton and Sisko
On Earth, video footage linked the bombing of the Antwerp Conference to Changeling infiltration. Sisko's knowledge of the Founders led to his brief promotion to Chief of Starfleet Security on Earth. Using Odo as a test subject, Sisko implemented many new security measures on Earth such as automated low-level phaser sweeps throughout Starfleet Headquarters. Unfortunately, his promotion was part of Sisko's former captain, now Admiral Leyton's plan to overthrow the Federation government. Leyton misjudged Sisko's loyalties, and the coup d'état failed when Sisko and Odo exposed the plan. (DS9: "Homefront", "Paradise Lost") 

Sisko surgically altered to appear Klingon
Changelings also infiltrated a high position within the Klingon Empire. In 2373, Sisko and crew were ordered to expose the impostor. Undergoing cosmetic alterations to appear Klingon and taking the Klingon name Jodmos, son of Kobor, Sisko took Worf, Odo and O'Brien to the Klingon outpost Ty'Gokor to expose Chancellor Gowron (whom the Founders had led Odo to believe was a Founder). It was later discovered that General Martok was the Changeling. The mission was a success, and it brought the two powers closer to reconciliation. (DS9: "Apocalypse Rising")

During a trip to the Gamma Quadrant that same year, Sisko took possession of a Jem'Hadar attack ship and returned the ship to Starfleet Intelligence. (DS9: "The Ship") Soon afterward, the Dominion formed an alliance with the Cardassian Union, gaining a foothold in the Alpha Quadrant. They attempted to destroy Deep Space 9 and Bajor and cripple the Klingon and Federation fleets in one action, but Sisko discovered their plan and thwarted it. This new turn of events convinced the Klingon government to reinstate the Khitomer Accords, and Sisko allowed a permanent Klingon presence on the station. However, with the new Dominion presence in the Alpha Quadrant, war was inevitable. (DS9: "By Inferno's Light")

The Dominion War
As Dominion fleets began coming through the wormhole on a weekly basis, Starfleet made the decision to mine the entrance to the wormhole. Sisko commanded the station during the resulting Battle of Deep Space 9, the opening strike of the Dominion War. During the final moments of the battle, Sisko gave a speech to the station residents, telling them of his fondness for commanding the station, and promising to return. The Dominion took control of the station, but Sisko implemented a computer program which completely destroyed DS9's main computer core. Sisko retreated aboard the Defiant, leaving his prized antique baseball behind; the station's new commander, Gul Dukat, knew this was a sign from Sisko that he would eventually return. (DS9: "Call to Arms")

The Dominion attacks
Sisko commanded the Defiant for the next three months, engaging in numerous battles with Jem'Hadar and Cardassian forces. Ordered to fall back to Starbase 375, Sisko was placed in command of a mission behind enemy lines to destroy a ketracel-white storage facility. Sisko and crew traveled aboard the stolen Jem'Hadar attack ship he had acquired the year before, and completed the mission. (DS9: "A Time to Stand") However, their ship was destroyed and they were stranded on a planet in Dominion space along with Jem'Hadar forces. Knowing he was beaten, the commanding Vorta, Keevan, gave Sisko his force's attack plans. Sisko was forced to massacre the Jem'Hadar troops, despite his personal objections. (DS9: "Rocks and Shoals") Sisko's crew was soon rescued by General Martok and Worf aboard the IKS Rotarran. (DS9: "Sons and Daughters")

Having completed his mission, Sisko was promoted to adjutant for Vice Admiral William Ross at Starbase 375, while command of the Defiant passed to Lieutenant Commander Dax. (DS9: "Behind the Lines") Using his new influence in Starfleet, Sisko created a plan to retake Deep Space 9, Operation Return, and convinced Starfleet to commit its forces. After learning that the minefield around the wormhole was about to be neutralized, Sisko ordered the operation to commence immediately. (DS9: "Favor the Bold") He commanded the Starfleet forces during the battle from the Defiant, and made his way to DS9. Faced with an armada of Dominion ships as the minefield fell, Sisko ordered the Defiant to go down with guns blazing. In a vision from the Prophets, Sisko convinced them to stop the invading fleet, and he returned to retake the station. (DS9: "Sacrifice of Angels")

Following his defeat during Operation Return and the death of his daughter, Ziyal, Gul Dukat descended into madness and was captured. He was forced to stand trial for his crimes. Captain Sisko was to testify at his trial, but their transport, the USS Honshu, was destroyed by Cardassian forces. They escaped in a shuttlecraft and crashed on a nearby planet. There, Dukat's madness intensified, and he attempted to kill Sisko. Vowing to kill every Bajoran, Dukat escaped as the Defiant rescued Sisko. Following the ordeal, Sisko vowed that from then on, "it's him or me." (DS9: "Waltz")

Sisko with Romulan Senator Vreenak
Soon afterward, Sisko hired Elim Garak to fabricate a recording designed to bring the Romulan Star Empire into the war. This plan was approved by Starfleet. Sisko struggled with the ethical implications of his actions, but in the end decided it was worth it. With the help of a few of Garak's sources, he was able to fabricate a holo-recording of the Dominion and Cardassians planning to invade Romulan space violating their nonaggression pact. He secretly invited Senator Vreenak over to DS9 to "show" him the evidence. However, Vreenak later found it was a fake and was prepared to expose this "vile deception" to the entire quadrant. A few days later, it was reported that the senator's shuttle was destroyed. Sisko confronted Garak on what he had done, but the former Obsidian Order agent pointed out that it was the only way to make the Empire think that the Dominion was responsible, with the acceptable losses of one convict, one senator and the self-respect of one Starfleet captain. As a result, the Romulans entered the war, attacking several Cardassian outposts along the Cardassian-Romulan border, and turned the odds in the Federation's favor. Sisko later recorded what happened into his personal log before deleting it. (DS9: "In the Pale Moonlight")

Sisko was chosen to command the first offensive into Dominion space in late-2374. The First Battle of Chin'toka was a success, but while Sisko was away, Gul Dukat managed to close the Bajoran wormhole, cutting off Bajor from the Prophets, after having killed Jadzia Dax. Sisko felt responsible, and decided to take a leave of absence to find a way to restore the wormhole. Sisko and Jake returned to New Orleans, not knowing if they would ever return to DS9. (DS9: "Tears of the Prophets")

After three months on Earth, Sisko was given a vision of a woman's face in the sands of Tyree. He reconstructed her face on a PADD, and Jake recognized her from a photo in which she appeared with his grandfather, Joseph, who reluctantly identified her as Sarah Sisko, Sisko's biological mother. Joseph finally told his son about his true mother, prompting Benjamin to travel to Tyree to find the meaning of his vision. He departed along with his father, Jake, and Ezri Dax, the new Dax host. (DS9: "Image in the Sand") While on Tyree, Sisko discovered the Orb of the Emissary, which restored the Bajoran wormhole. He also communicated with the Prophet who had possessed his mother, and learned of her true identity. Following the reopening of the wormhole, the tide of the war turned back to the Federation's favor, and Sisko returned to the station. (DS9: "Shadows and Symbols")

The Defiant is destroyed
Later that year, Sisko commanded the Defiant in the Second Battle of Chin'toka. The ship was destroyed by the Dominion's new allies, the Breen Confederacy. (DS9: "The Changing Face of Evil") Sisko was then given command of the USS Sao Paulo, in late 2375, which was renamed to USS Defiant. (DS9: "The Dogs of War")

Sisko then helped command the final assault into Dominion territory. The Battle of Cardassia was a success, with the help of the Cardassian Rebellion. Afterward, Sisko, Admiral Ross, and Chancellor Martok gathered in the ruins of Cardassia to celebrate. Faced with the destruction the Dominion had wrought in retaliation for the Cardassian uprising, Sisko did not feel like celebrating. He returned to the station to bid farewell to his crew before their reassignment. (DS9: "What You Leave Behind")

The Emissary
Initial doubts
When Sisko first met with Kai Opaka in 2369, she surprised him by proclaiming that he would be the long prophesied Emissary to the Prophets. He was at first skeptical of her assessment, and immediately tried to dismiss her, stating that he was simply a Starfleet officer. Any religious role in another culture would directly clash with his oath to uphold the principles of Starfleet. However, when he discovered the Bajoran wormhole and made first contact with the non-linear lifeforms the Bajorans knew as the Prophets, he became slightly less skeptical. He still rejected the role, but realized that the Prophets' ability to see outside of time must have allowed them to communicate certain information to the Bajorans. Sisko taught the Prophets about linear existence, and became very important to them. They began referring to him as "The Sisko." (DS9: "Emissary") The Bajorans began celebrating the arrival of the Emissary each year during their Ha'mara festival. (DS9: "Starship Down")

Later that year, Sisko met Vedek Winn Adami for the first time during a Bajoran-Federation ideological conflict on the station. The Vedek, an ultra-conservative, was not sure that she believed Sisko was the Emissary. (DS9: "In the Hands of the Prophets")

In 2371, Sisko was confronted by Vedek Yarka, who told him that he had discovered a prophecy in which the Emissary was involved in the destruction of the Celestial Temple. After reviewing Trakor's Third Prophecy, Sisko ignored the Vedek's warnings. He continued work on a subspace communications relay through the wormhole into the Gamma Quadrant. However, Major Kira Nerys was slowly convinced that Yarka was correct. She interpreted the prophecy as referring to three Cardassian scientists aboard the station, and a comet which was discovered near the wormhole. The comet was on a course leading it into the wormhole, causing it to collapse. Sisko stopped the comet, but inadvertently released trace amounts of silithium, which caused the wormhole to constantly remain slightly open. In the end, this chain of events actually fulfilled Trakor's prophecy, without the destruction of the wormhole as the final outcome. Sisko began to take an interest in other Bajoran prophecies, but continued his skepticism about his role as the Emissary. (DS9: "Destiny")

Following destiny's path
Akorem Laan's lightship
Sisko continued walking the fine line between acknowledging the Bajoran beliefs and rejecting their admiration for him. In 2372, an ancient Bajoran lightship emerged from the wormhole carrying famed poet Akorem Laan. Akorem had apparently discovered the wormhole centuries before, and had been inside it ever since. Finally able to relinquish his title, Sisko jumped at the chance to allow the poet to become the Emissary. However, when Akorem began guiding Bajor down a road incompatible with joining the Federation, Sisko decided to challenge his title. He began studying the ancient texts, and realized that many of the prophecies applied to him, and not to Akorem. The two men traveled back into the wormhole and met with the Prophets, who confirmed that Sisko was in fact intended to be the Emissary. They returned Akorem to his own time, altering the timeline, but preserving everyone's memory of the previous events. Following this, Sisko slowly began to embrace his role as the Emissary. (DS9: "Accession")

Sisko experiencing a threatening vision of Bajor's destruction
In mid-2373, Sisko experienced a series of pagh'tem'fars in which the location of the lost city of B'hala was revealed to him. He was also shown the destruction of Bajor after its entrance into the Federation. Following his visions, he recommended that Bajor not join the Federation at that time, which angered Starfleet Command. Sisko was forced to undergo surgery to stop the visions when they became life-threatening. (DS9: "Rapture")

When Sisko entered the wormhole facing a Dominion fleet following Operation Return, the Prophets communicated with him once again. They refused to allow Sisko to die, and granted the destruction of the Dominion fleet. Referring to his life as "the game", they enacted a penance and told him that though he was "of Bajor" he would find no rest there. (DS9: "Sacrifice of Angels")

Sisko's morale slowly fell, and a few months later, after losing his friend Quentin Swofford, he was thinking of resigning his post. Knowing he had much work left on Bajor, the Prophets sent him another series of pagh'tem'far, in which he was shown the life of Benny Russell, a black writer on Earth in the 20th century. The trials endured by Russell allowed Sisko to reevaluate his problems, and he decided to stay on the station. (DS9: "Far Beyond the Stars")

Later that year, Sisko inadvertently instigated the prophesied Reckoning, the battle between the Prophets and the Pah-wraiths. His son was possessed by a Kosst Amojan and Major Kira was taken over by a Prophet. The outcome of the battle was indefinite due to interference by Kai Winn. (DS9: "The Reckoning")

Sisko fulfils his destiny in the Bajoran Fire Caves
Following the release of a Pah-wraith by Dukat into the Orb of Contemplation in 2374, Sisko was confronted with visions of his biological mother. He traveled to Tyree and discovered the Orb of the Emissary, which reopened the wormhole and the Orbs. (DS9: "Image in the Sand", "Shadows and Symbols")

Sisko embraces his destiny
Sisko was led to the Bajoran Fire Caves following the victory at the Battle of Cardassia, where he engaged in a final showdown with the Pah-wraiths, in the form of Dukat. Sisko destroyed the evil Book of the Kosst Amojan and trapped Dukat, along with the Pah-wraiths, in the Fire Caves forever. He was taken to the Celestial Temple, where according to the Prophets, his work had only begun. 

Sisko's last act in Starfleet was promoting Nog to the rank of Lieutenant; in recognition for all the young Ferengi's contributions in the Dominion War.(DS9: "What You Leave Behind")


Personal life
Hobbies
Sisko enjoyed cooking instead of just using the food replicator, thanks to his father, a renowned chef whose specialty was Creole food. Sisko would cook Hungarian food, like Chicken paprikash, when in a really good mood. (DS9: "A Man Alone", "Family Business") He also played the piano and had an excellent singing voice. (DS9: "Image in the Sand", "His Way", "Badda-Bing, Badda-Bang") He played Jokarian chess and poker, but wasn't a good bluffer. (DS9: "The Nagus", "Paradise")

According to Nog and Hector Ilario, Saurian brandy was Sisko's favorite drink. (DS9: "Treachery, Faith and the Great River", "Field of Fire")

Sisko with his antique baseball
Sisko was a fan of baseball. He owned several holosuite recreations of the game, and a baseball card of Giants and Mets legend Willie Mays, gifted to him by his son Jake after a lengthy series of negotiations aided by Nog. He had a baseball, which he kept on his office desk, given to him by an alien impersonating baseball player Buck Bokai. It appears Bokai's team, the London Kings, was Sisko's favorite. (DS9: "Emissary", "If Wishes Were Horses", "Past Tense, Part II", "In the Cards") He was also on the Academy wrestling team. (DS9: "Q-Less", "Apocalypse Rising")

Sisko's most ambitious pastime was the construction of an ancient Bajoran lightship replica. Sisko built the ship from scratch, using only materials available to the ancient Bajorans, with the exception of artificial gravity. The ship proved spaceworthy, and even helped prove that Bajorans had achieved spaceflight centuries before the Cardassians. (DS9: "Explorers") He also enjoyed maintaining a complex clock he first constructed while controlled by a Saltah'na energy sphere. (DS9: "Dramatis Personae", "Hippocratic Oath")

Two legends meet
Another of Sisko's interests was history. He collected models of old Starfleet starships, and ancient African art. (DS9: "The Search, Part I") He was very knowledgeable about 21st century history, which came in handy when he became accidentally stranded in 2024 San Francisco. (DS9: "Past Tense, Part I") One of his heroes was Captain James T. Kirk, whom Sisko got to meet during another accidental time trip to 2268; he even managed to acquire Kirk's autograph, Kirk thought he was signing a crew complement list, and told Kirk it had been an honor to serve with him. He also commented he would love to shake Kirk's hand, asking him about the Gorn he had fought previously on Cestus III. (DS9: "Trials and Tribble-ations")

Relationships
Soon after graduating the Academy in 2354, Ben met his future wife Jennifer on Gilgo Beach on Earth. Sisko was carrying lemonades through the hot sand and stopped on Jennifer's towel to cool his feet. When Jennifer learned that Sisko was a young ensign, she was reluctant to go out with him, because her mother had warned her about dating young ensigns. However, she relented, and her mother turned out to love Sisko. The two were married, and their son Jake was born a year later. Jennifer and Jake accompanied Sisko on his assignment to the USS Saratoga. When the ship was destroyed in a battle with the Borg, Jennifer was killed. (DS9: "Emissary")

A woman named Fenna was Sisko's first attraction after his wife's death. In 2370, Sisko met her on the Promenade and was instantly taken with her. Unfortunately, he later discovered that Fenna was only a mental projection of Nidell, a telepathic woman married to Professor Gideon Seyetik. (DS9: "Second Sight")

In two trips to the mirror universe, Sisko met the alternate version of his wife, Jennifer. He also had a brief romantic encounter with the alternate version of Jadzia. (DS9: "Through the Looking Glass", "Shattered Mirror")

While telepathically influenced by Lwaxana Troi, Jadzia Dax displayed romantic interest in Sisko, which according to Doctor Bashir, she only harbored on a subconscious level. Sisko did not appreciate her advances. (DS9: "Fascination")

Sisko wishing Kasidy Yates farewell shortly before her imprisonment
Sisko was introduced to Kasidy Yates in 2371 by his son. The two began dating after they discovered a shared interest in baseball. (DS9: "Family Business") Yates later began smuggling supplies to the Maquis, and Sisko was forced to arrest her in 2372. (DS9: "For the Cause") After Yates served her sentence, she returned to Deep Space 9 a year later, and the two resumed their relationship. (DS9: "Rapture")

Sisko marries Kasidy Yates in 2375
The two were engaged in 2375. (DS9: "Penumbra") The Prophets warned Sisko that the two were not destined to walk the same path, causing Ben to call off the wedding; however he soon relented and the couple was married in a small ceremony conducted by Admiral William Ross. (DS9: "'Til Death Do Us Part") Shortly thereafter, Kasidy became pregnant. (DS9: "The Dogs of War") After being taken by the Prophets to the Celestial Temple, Sisko appeared to Kasidy in a vision, telling her that he would someday return, and that he loved her. (DS9: "What You Leave Behind")

Jake
Jake Sisko
Sisko's son Jake was born in 2355 to his first wife Jennifer. Sisko remembered taking care of Jake as a baby, and looked back on the time fondly. (DS9: "The Abandoned") By the time Jake became a teenager, Benjamin had already imparted his love of baseball to his son. The two watched holo-recreations of famous games, and played the game themselves. (DS9: "Emissary", "If Wishes Were Horses", "Starship Down")

Prior to 2367, the Sisko family made a camping trip to Itamish III, where Jake learned water skiing. While on a camping trip on a planet in the Gamma Quadrant in 2370, Jake recalled this vacation as the happiest time he and his parents had had together. (DS9: "The Jem'Hadar")

On Deep Space 9, Jake's friendship with Nog bothered Sisko at first, since Nog seemed to always get Jake into trouble. However, when Jake began to teach Nog to read, Sisko began to see their friendship was beneficial, and allowed them to remain friends. (DS9: "The Nagus") In 2370, Jake told his father that he did not wish to follow in his father's footsteps in Starfleet; Sisko took the news well and gave Jake his blessing, provided that Jake pursue his chosen vocation with all his ambition. (DS9: "Shadowplay")

Sisko became very concerned in 2370 when Jake's first girlfriend turned out to be a dabo girl named Mardah. (DS9: "Playing God") When Sisko finally met the girl, however, his fears were assuaged, as Mardah turned out to be very nice and began to reveal sides of Jake that Sisko had never known. (DS9: "The Abandoned")

As Jake began to concentrate on his future career in writing, Sisko felt his son slipping away. He occasionally forced Jake to come with him on various outings: on a trip to the Gamma Quadrant, the test flight of Sisko's Bajoran lightship, and to see the Bajoran wormhole undergo a subspace inversion. (DS9: "The Jem'Hadar", "Explorers", "The Visitor") But Sisko finally had to allow his son to become an adult, and in 2373, Jake moved out and became roommates with Nog, who had by then become a Starfleet cadet. (DS9: "The Ascent")

Ben and his son in 2375
In 2372 of an alternate timeline, during an accident on the Defiant, Sisko was caught in subspace for more than thirty years. During this time, Jake became obsessed with finding a way to bring his father back, and eventually sacrificed his own life to return Sisko back to the moment of the accident. (DS9: "The Visitor") Later that year, when Jake was slowly being killed by Onaya, Sisko discovered her true nature, and saved his son. (DS9: "The Muse")

When the Dominion temporarily took control of DS9 in 2374, Jake decided to remain behind; Sisko was reluctant to leave him behind, but knew that Jake was a grown man capable of making his own decisions, however dangerous. (DS9: "Call to Arms") Sisko did, however, have to explain leaving Jake behind to his very angered father. (DS9: "A Time to Stand")

After Sisko's disappearance, Jake felt troubled by the loss of his father. He was comforted by Kasidy Yates and Colonel Kira Nerys, who believed that Sisko would return. (DS9: "What You Leave Behind")

Friendships
Academy friends
Sisko went to the Academy with a Benzenite named Laporin, and Quentin Swofford, both of whom became starship captains. (DS9: "Apocalypse Rising", "Far Beyond the Stars")

Sisko's old Academy friend Calvin "Cal" Hudson in 2370
Sisko's closest friend during his early career was Calvin Hudson. Sisko and Hudson attended the Academy together, and stayed friends afterward. The Siskos and Hudsons often took family vacations together. They once attended the Mazurka Festival at New Berlin. (DS9: "The Maquis, Part I") When Hudson abandoned Starfleet and joined the Maquis, Sisko felt Hudson was personally betraying him. In 2370, he allowed Hudson to escape Starfleet custody, but ended their twenty-year friendship. (DS9: "The Maquis, Part II") Hudson was later killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians, news of which hit Sisko pretty bad.(DS9: "Blaze of Glory")

Dax
Curzon Dax
Benjamin's mentor during his younger days was Trill Ambassador Curzon Dax. After meeting Dax on Pelios Station in the 2350s, Dax and Sisko were close for almost twenty years. While defending Dax against charges of murder in 2369, Sisko described the Trill's influence on him: "[He] taught me to appreciate life in ways I'd never thought about before. He taught me about art, and science and diplomacy. Whatever sense of honor I have today, he nurtured." (DS9: "Dax")

Dax attended Sisko's bachelor party in 2354, and the two often visited Risa together. (DS9: "Invasive Procedures") When Curzon died in 2367, his symbiont was passed on to a woman named Jadzia. Despite the new appearance of Dax, Sisko insisted on calling her "old man." (DS9: "Emissary") Though it was initially difficult for him to adjust to Dax's new appearance, Jadzia and Sisko became friends again quickly. (DS9: "A Man Alone")

Sisko soon considered Jadzia one of his closest friends. On at least two separate occasions, when faced with the possibility of her death, Sisko did whatever it took to save her. Jadzia once told Sisko in turn that, after living seven lifetimes, Dax had never had a friend like Sisko. (DS9: "Invasive Procedures", "Equilibrium", "Rejoined") 

Upon Sisko's promotion to captain, Jadzia remarked that Curzon would have been proud of him, but not as proud as she was, a sentiment Sisko greatly appreciated. (DS9: "The Adversary")

When Jadzia called off her wedding to Worf in 2374, it was Sisko who told her that she was being unreasonable, finally convincing her to proceed with the nuptials. (DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited")

Sisko and Jadzia Dax in 2374
Jadzia was killed by Gul Dukat later that year, and Sisko was forced to say goodbye to her. Taking a moment before her funeral, Sisko told her that while Curzon was his mentor, she had been his friend and he needed her most now, and painfully regretted that she was gone. (DS9: "Tears of the Prophets")

However, the Dax symbiont lived on, having been joined with Ezri Tigan. The new Ezri Dax tracked down Sisko on Earth and helped him discover the Orb of the Emissary. (DS9: "Shadows and Symbols") Dax eventually decided to return to Deep Space 9, and continued her friendship with Sisko for a third lifetime. Unfortunately Ezri was unprepared for the Dax symbiont and struggled to adjust to the new memories; in the process of helping her, Sisko became both her commanding officer and mentor. (DS9: "Afterimage")
