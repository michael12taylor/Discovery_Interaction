<html><p>The relationship between Sisko and his Bajoran first officer, Kira Nerys, began with a rocky start, since Kira openly stated that she was opposed to the Federation's presence for fear that that it would become an occupying power. (DS9: "Emissary")  Kira's views on the Federation shifted once the wormhole was discovered, and she begrudgingly accepted the need for the Federation's presence to keep the Cardassians away. However, the early relationship between Sisko and Kira was still often defined by arguments regarding different approaches to station policy. At times, Kira was not only argumentative but also insubordinate contacting an admiral over Sisko's head. (DS9: "Past Prologue") However, Sisko stated that despite these arguments he and Kira always came away with new appreciation for the other's views. Kira joked at the end of their first year that she didn't believe Sisko was the devil, despite Winn Adami's attempt to portray the Federation as evil. (DS9: "In the Hands of the Prophets")

Kira looking after Sisko when he was injured in a Jem'Hadar attack
Kira's religious beliefs further complicated the relationship with Sisko. Like other religious Bajorans, Kira viewed Sisko as the Emissary of the Prophets, which left Sisko feeling uncomfortable and conflicted at times. Kira attempted to keep her religious beliefs to herself; however, when Sisko was injured by a Jem'Hadar attack, she prayed for his recovery. After the incident, Sisko invited her to attend a baseball game with him. As Sisko grew to accept his position as the Emissary, the tension between the two softened. (DS9: "Destiny", "Starship Down")  

When the Federation was forced to abandon Deep Space 9, Sisko, speaking as both the Emissary and the commanding officer, ordered Kira and the other Bajorans to avoid interfering in the conflict with the Dominion. (DS9: "Call to Arms") However, as it became clear that the Federation was losing the war, Kira disregarded Sisko's orders and formed a new resistance against the Dominion. (DS9: "Rocks and Shoals")

Kira also shared her reservations with Sisko regarding his intentions to marry Kasidy Yates, due to the warnings from the Prophets that Sisko's marriage would cause him pain. (DS9: "'Til Death Do Us Part")

Miles O'Brien
Sisko and Miles O'Brien's relationship could be described as a classic example of a crewman's loyalty and devotion to a commander. This relationship developed quickly, with O'Brien respecting Sisko from the start, and Sisko coming to rely on O'Brien to keep Deep Space Nine running since the earliest days of his command.

Sisko and O'Brien talking about Jake.
Sisko was quick to reprimand O'Brien, after the Tosk incident, even though he approved of O'Brien's actions on a personal level. (DS9: "Captive Pursuit")

Aside from this incident, Sisko developed a very casual friendship with O'Brien, despite the difference in rank and the fact that Miles was an enlisted crewman and Sisko an officer. They both would occasionally talk about their respective roles as fathers. (DS9: "Call to Arms")

Sisko verbally threatened the Cardassians should any harm come to O'Brien, when he was held under false charges in 2370. Upon stopping the Cardassians' plot regarding the Maquis, he pulled a few strings and extended O'Brien's vacation time.(DS9: "Tribunal")

O'Brien volunteered to remain behind on Deep Space Nine to help Sisko, Li Nalas, and a handful of others retain control of the station after Starfleet was ordered off by the Provisional Government, under the influence of The Circle. He did this even though it could have meant the end of his Starfleet career and over the strenuous objections of his wife. (DS9: "The Siege")

In Sisko's words, he was confident that O'Brien could "take care of himself as well as anyone [Sisko] knew". (DS9: "Honor Among Thieves")

Sisko was sympathetic to O'Brien after his daughter Molly was thrown into a time portal. Once the incident ended, he volunteered to represent and defend the actions of his engineer at any ensuing Starfleet hearing. (DS9: "Time's Orphan")

Odo
Sisko speaking with Odo in 2371
Although Odo noted that he didn't think he would like Benjamin Sisko when he first met him, the two formed a keen respect for each other over the years. When Sisko was promoted to Captain, Odo noted that, while he didn't personally see the relevance of such titles, he could think of nobody who deserved this ritual more than Sisko. Sisko reciprocated this admiration more than once. When Odo's life was at stake following his capture by the Obsidian Order and his illness, Sisko took the Defiant into Dominion territory to save Odo, despite the risks of conflict with the Dominion. Odo also accompanied Sisko back to Earth when they received news that the Changelings had reached Earth. He helped him develop means of detecting Changelings on the planet. Odo later helped Sisko, who was falsely accused of being a Changeling by Admiral Leyton, escape. (DS9: "Emissary", "The Adversary", "The Die is Cast", "Homefront", "Paradise Lost", "Broken Link")

The crew and residents of Deep Space 9
Sisko grew very close to his command crew on Deep Space 9. Besides Dax, Miles O'Brien, and Kira Nerys, he formed close relationships with Worf, Odo and Julian Bashir. He occasionally invited his staff to a home-cooked dinner. (DS9: "Equilibrium") However, he often had to draw the line between friend and commanding officer. On more than one occasion when a member of his senior staff bent (or broke) the rules, Sisko was forced to come down on them without regard for their off-duty relationship. 

Sisko was not quite fond of Quark, but over time, he began to tolerate the Ferengi. He blackmailed Quark on a number of occasions when he thought it necessary, such as convincing him to stay on DS9, and helping the Federation make First Contact with the Founders of the Dominion. He was grateful when Quark helped uncover the first Dominion spy, and when he saved his life from a Jem'Hadar. (DS9: "Emissary", "The Jem'Hadar")

Nog with Sisko, attempting to convince him to support his interest in joining Starfleet
Though initially unsupportive of Jake's friendship with Nog, Sisko eventually grew to like the young Ferengi. Nog asked Sisko to help him apply to Starfleet Academy; initially wary of the idea, Sisko soon recognized Nog's genuine desire to become a cadet, and he approved. (DS9: "Heart of Stone") When Nog returned to DS9 for field study, Sisko actually encouraged his friendship with Jake, hoping that Nog's new Starfleet discipline would rub off on his son. (DS9: "The Ascent") Nog later served under Sisko on the Defiant, and Sisko began to rely on Nog's presence among his crew. (DS9: "Call to Arms")

The only other Ferengi Sisko got along with on DS9 was Rom, Nog's father and Quark's brother. At one point, both Sisko and Rom conspired to get Jake and Nog talking in the same room. Sisko also performed the wedding of Rom and Leeta. (DS9: "The Ascent", "Call to Arms") 

When Sisko assembled his senior staff in 2375 for a baseball game on the holosuite against a team of Vulcans, the Logicians led by Captain Solok, the game brought the crew together, and they enjoyed the experience. During this time, he intimidated Rom by kicking him off his baseball team (the Niners) due to his poor batting skills. He later apologized [sincerely] to Rom for his attitude. (DS9: "Take Me Out to the Holosuite") 

Later that year, Sisko also took part in a jack-in-the-box program involving Vic Fontaine with his crew. Though intially skeptical, Sisko helped regain Vic's lounge after it had been taken over by the mob. (DS9: "Badda-Bing, Badda-Bang") Sisko assembled his crew together one last time, at Vic's, following the end of the Dominion War. (DS9: "What You Leave Behind")

William Ross
After the Dominion War started, Sisko and Vice Admiral William Ross developed a good working relationship. In early-2374, Ross made Sisko his adjutant. Later that year, when the Federation Alliance was ready to go on the offensive against the Dominion, Ross gave Sisko the news that Starfleet had chosen him to plan the invasion of Cardassia. (DS9: "Behind the Lines", "Tears of the Prophets")

Despite their fairly solid working relationship, Ross expressed some frustration with Sisko's status as the Emissary of the Prophets. This frustration came to a head in late-2374 on the eve of the First Battle of Chin'toka, when Sisko told Ross that the Prophets told him not to go to Cardassia. Ross told Sisko that he could no longer be both a Starfleet captain and the Emissary of the Prophets, and that he would have to choose one or the other. Sisko opted to go to Cardassia. (DS9: "Tears of the Prophets")

Ross performed Sisko's wedding ceremony to Kasidy Yates in 2375. (DS9: "'Til Death Do Us Part")

Memorable quotes
"You value your ignorance of what is to come?"
"That may be the most important thing to understand about Humans. It is the unknown that defines our existence. We are constantly searching, not just for answers to our questions, but for new questions. We are explorers. We explore our lives, day by day. And we explore the galaxy, trying to expand the boundaries of our knowledge. And that is why I am here. Not to conquer you with weapons or ideas, but to co-exist and learn."

"You exist here."
"I exist here. I don't know if you can understand; I see her like this every time I close my eyes, in the darkness, in the blink of an eye, I see her like this."
"None of your past experiences helped prepare you for this consequence."
"And I have never figured out how to live without her." 
"So you choose to exist here. It is not linear."
"No, it's not linear."

"There's an old saying: Fortune favors the bold. Well, I guess we're about to find out."

"You hit me! Picard never hit me!"
"I'm not Picard!"

"Phew. I wonder when that happened. [...] When did I start thinking of this Cardassian monstrosity as home?"

"...if the station falls, then Bajor falls, and I will not let that happen."

"Better luck next time."
"You better hope there isn't a next time, mister! I have cut you a lot of slack in the past; I even decided to look away once or twice when I could have come down hard on you, but those days are over! Now we may not be able to get you for selling weapons but you so much as LITTER on the Promenade, and I will nail you to the wall!!" 

"The Bajorans who have lived with us on the station, who have worked with us for months, who helped us move this station to protect the wormhole, who joined us to explore the Gamma Quadrant, who have begun to build the future of Bajor with us, these people know that we are neither the enemy nor the devil. We don't always agree. We have some damned good fights in fact, but we always come away from them with a little better understanding and appreciation of each other."

"On Earth, there is no poverty, no crime, no war. You look out the window of Starfleet Headquarters and you see paradise. Well, it's easy to be a saint in paradise, but the Maquis do not live in paradise. Out there in the Demilitarized Zone, all the problems haven't been solved yet. Out there, there are no saints — just people. Angry, scared, determined people who are going to do whatever it takes to survive, whether it meets with Federation approval or not!"

"When I first took command of this post, all I wanted was to be somewhere else. Anywhere but here. But now, five years later, this station has become my home. And you all of you have become my family and leaving this station, leaving you, is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. But this war isn't over yet. I want you to know that, while we were keeping the Dominion occupied, a Starfleet/Klingon task force crossed the border into Cardassia and destroyed the Dominion shipyards on Torros III. Your sacrifices, our sacrifices, made this victory possible. But no victory can make this moment any easier for me and I promise, I will not rest until I stand with you again. Here. In this place. Where I belong."

"My father used to say that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I laid the first stone right there. I'd committed myself. I'd pay any price; go to any lengths because my cause was righteous. My...intentions were good. In the beginning, that seemed like enough."

"So... I lied. I cheated. I bribed men to cover the crimes of other men. I am an accessory to murder. But the most damning thing of all... I think I can live with it. And if I had to do it all over again, I would. Garak was right about one thing, a guilty conscience is a small price to pay for the safety of the Alpha Quadrant. So I will learn to live with it. Because I can live with it. I can live with it... Computer, erase that entire personal log."

Ben Sisko has been holographically duplicated on a number of occasions.

A recreation was created by the personnel of Deep Space 9 in 2370 in order to lure Bajoran soldiers into a holosuite during the coup d'état attempt by "The Circle". (DS9: "The Siege")
A transporter accident in 2372 aboard Deep Space 9 resulted in transporter patterns that would normally be stored in the pattern buffer to overwrite some of the characters in the Julian Bashir, Secret Agent holoprogram set in the 1960s.

Appendices
Background information
Benjamin Sisko was played by Avery Brooks.

Character creation
Ronald D. Moore mentioned the story of Moses as an inspiration for the developments in Sisko's life. (AOL chat, 1997)

In the script for "Emissary", Benjamin Sisko was described as "a rugged, charismatic man in his late thirties," as of 2366. 

The original Writer's Bible for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, created in 1992,  gave this biography for the character:

Casting
When Avery Brooks' agent first rang him to tell him that there was a role available in a new Star Trek show, Brooks laughed, because he instinctively felt he was going to be offered a role requiring heavy prosthetics, which he wasn't interested in doing (though he ended up doing so anyway, in "Apocalypse Rising"). After finding out the role was that of a Human, Brooks was still unconvinced, and of his pursuit of the role he said, "This will never work." Indeed, on his way to his audition for the part, the transmission in his car began to slip, so he called the producers and nonchalantly told them he couldn't make it; he was surprised when they rearranged his audition. It was ultimately the quality of the script for "Emissary" which convinced Brooks of the value of the show. ("Crew Dossier: Benjamin Sisko", DS9 Season 7 DVD special features)

Speaking in 1992, shortly after filming had begun on "Emissary", Avery Brooks said of Sisko, "He is very, very human. He shows what he feels, wears what he feels. He is a quick thinker, but yet a deep thinker. He is a single parent, and thus is worried about raising his son. In this case, of course, he is a widower, so that part of his history is there, especially every time he looks at his son, he is seeing that part of his life, indeed, seeing his wife, and we have to assume that he loved her very deeply. So there are indeed conflicts, Human conflicts, which make it a wonderful experience because you can play everything." (Hidden File 01, DS9 Season 1 DVD special features)

In 2012, Brooks recalled his role as Sisko: "When I read the pilot script, it was the presentation of a man dealing with loss and raising a son, and how he handled those situations, that really got my attention. Certainly the fact you have a black man in a command position is very important. That is something that goes far beyond just having black people working on a show, which itself is also very important. It goes to children being able to see themselves on screen and visualize that in the future they will be doing something of importance to the world at large. It addresses the situation of having all kinds of people interacting and cooperating for the mutual survival of the planet. The writing was exceptional, and the funny thing is I initially said no to Star Trek. My wife convinced me to go to the audition. She was the one who said, 'You can't say no to this'." 

Characterization
According to Michael Piller, "It was harder to define Sisko as a character than perhaps any of the others, and ultimately it took us probably a season and a half to reach the conclusion that Sisko was a builder, a man who built things, stayed with projects, as opposed to the driver, the captain of a starship who went off and moved from place to place." (New Frontiers: The Story of Deep Space Nine, DS9 Season 2 DVD special features) Robert Hewitt Wolfe also contrasted Sisko the builder against Picard the explorer in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion (p. 30): "[Sisko] wears his heart a little more on his sleeve, and acts on emotion, on instinct, more than Picard."

Hans Beimler also saw Sisko as a builder. Beimler commented, "Captain Sisko is a complicated man. He's a family man. He's a builder, a man who has come to this place and is trying to do something – he's not some kind of transient. Picard and Kirk were both captains who were 'passing through, ma'am', but Sisko is here to stay, to build something more lasting. I certainly can relate to that situation and that kind of man; he's a different kind of hero, more complex in a way." (The Official Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Magazine issue 15)

Speaking in 1999, just after filming on "What You Leave Behind" had finished, Ira Steven Behr said, "Sisko's arc is pretty clear. He came to the station, it was an assignment he did not want, he was not happy to be there, and he became a man who talks about living on Bajor for the rest of his life. So, I think it was a healing process for Sisko. I think he's a wonderful leader, and he's a great family man. And he came to the show a wounded man, who had just lost his wife, was somewhat bitter, and he became a religious icon." ("Crew Dossier: Benjamin Sisko", DS9 Season 7 DVD special features)

Avery Brooks has stated of Sisko, "The relationship with his son was critically important, aside from the fact that I have children, but knowing how tenuous, how fragile, how fleeting, ultimately, the moment, or moments that you have with your children, how important and critical the time that you spend early on in sowing these seeds that you hope will help your child survive and then pray that you've done the right thing." ("Crew Dossier: Benjamin Sisko", DS9 Season 7 DVD special features) Cirroc Lofton also says, "With Jake's character, he brought out the human-ness in the captain because otherwise you would just see the captain as an authoritative figure, you'd see him as just being someone who just gives orders, and someone who's really firm and aggressive, with Jake he can be playful, and you see the father side and the Human side of this icon, this character, this person who you respect, but there's another side to him, the loving, caring side, the playful side." ("Crew Dossier: Jake Sisko", DS9 Season 7 DVD special features)

Brooks has also commented, "The investigation of self, or the discovery of self, is an internal journey. The investigation of the unknown is not outer, ultimately, but inner. So, the idea of this man reluctantly wrestling with this idea of being the chosen one, to make this journey, this internal journey, towards the discovery of self, something that human-kind does, until they leave the planet I'm sure, certainly that's what I'm doing." ("Crew Dossier: Benjamin Sisko", DS9 Season 7 DVD special features)

Brooks commented: "When people come up to me and ask what being Benjamin Sisko meant, I understand why they are asking me that," Brooks said. "I don't get mad or upset. I just let them know he was one aspect of my life, one role that was good to me, but not one that defines who or what I am. But I'm happy so many people remember it and remember me, and I hope the full message of Star Trek, that humanity must interact and evolve and survive in all its different experiences and embodiments, is what they really remember". 

One of the plans for a six-episode arc which started season six was to promote Sisko to admiral, even if only temporarily. This was vetoed after extensive discussion involving Ira Steven Behr, who "felt it took the lead character out of the Star Trek pantheon." He did, however, briefly serve as adjutant to Admiral Ross, temporarily turning over his command to Dax. (Star Trek Monthly issue 38) Around the same time, Ron D. Moore in an unrelated matter described Sisko as having evolved since the start of the series in that he had "grown accustomed to the idea that he may never get admiral's stars" and preferring to remain a captain on the frontier. (AOL chat, 1997) (AOL chat, 1997)

In Black and Brown Planets: The Politics of Race in Science Fiction, the authors write: "Perhaps after watching black actor Avery Brooks play Captain Sisko on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993–99), Americans no longer were alienated by the idea of electing a black man as the U.S. President".

Sisko underwent a major change of appearance between Seasons 3 and 4, shaving his head and growing a beard. This coincided with Avery Brooks reprising the role of Hawk in a Spenser: For Hire TV movie in which Hawk sported the same look. 

Other actors who auditioned for the role of Sisko were Robert Gwilym, Keith Allen, Pip Torrens, Ralph Brown, Anthony Head, Jolyon Baker, Peter Firth, Nick Brimble, Stefan Kalipha and Peter Capaldi (who later became the Twelfth Doctor in Doctor Who). 

Documentary
In the documentary What We Left Behind, the writers of DS9 pitch a new episode, where Sisko returns from the Prophets twenty years after the series.

Apocrypha
In the DS9 relaunch novels, Sisko returns from the Celestial Temple in the novel Unity, on the day that his daughter (β) Rebecca Jae Sisko is born, and subsequently lives on Bajor with Kasidy. As of the Star Trek: Typhon Pact novel Rough Beasts of Empire, Sisko has returned to Starfleet and is in command of the Galaxy-class starship USS Robinson (β). Whereas in Rough Beasts of Empire, Sisko requested a divorce from Kasidy on the basis of the Prophets warning him, several years earlier, that he would face great sorrow, but in Plagues of Night, he withdrew the request. In the novel Ascendance, Sisko starts a mission commanding the Robinson on a exploration mission into the Gamma Quadrant that he expects to last two years.

In the short story "The Dreamer and the Dream" from the anthology book Strange New Worlds 2016, Sisko's child with Kasidy was a boy named Jonathan.

In Star Trek Online, Sisko's antique baseball still sits at his former desk, in a protective case, and a Prophet encountered in the mission "Crack in the Mirror" says that "the Sisko" has convinced them to leave to the player character the task of retrieving the stolen Orb of Possibilities from the mirror universe. This seems to indicate that, in this continuity, Sisko has not returned from the Celestial Temple.

Benjamin Sisko of the alternate reality
The alternate reality version of Benjamin Sisko appears in the Star Trek: Ongoing story arc The Q Gambit where he is the founder and co-leader of the Free Federation Resistance. When Q transports the USS Enterprise over a hundred years into the future, Sisko meets James T. Kirk, Montgomery Scott and Nyota Uhura in the holding cells of Terok Nor. Having found a way out with help from Odo, Sisko intended for Kirk, Scott and Uhura to come with him. However, Kirk refused, stating that he will not leave his crew. Apologizing in advance, Sisko rendered Kirk unconscious with a punch to the face and all are beamed aboard the USS Defiant. When Kirk wakes up, Sisko informs him that they are on a course to meet with allies on Earth, which Sisko implied is very different. He then explains to Kirk the history of the past century, in which the Dominion used the Bajoran wormhole to arrive in the Alpha Quadrant and sway the Cardassian Union to join them. In response to the threat, the Klingons and Romulans joined forces to crush their mutual foes while the Federation attempted a failed diplomatic resolution. The Dominion eventually managed to infiltrate Romulus where they stole the red matter and used it to destroy the planet. The Klingons then turned on the Federation and, after destroying their fleet at Wolf 359, conquered Federation space. Now both the Klingon Empire and the Dominion exist in a state of cold war. Though the humans attempted a resistance against the Klingons, it was short lived and Sisko grew up under a Klingon flag on the renamed planet "Tera'." Having grown up on Earth ruled over by the Klingons, Sisko longed to leave the planet and explore other worlds and when he got older, he joined the Human Auxiliary Corps as a cargo pilot and eventually started the Free Federation Resistance movement, which embodies the ideals of the Federation; ideals of freedom that can never be eradicated. Finishing his story, Sisko and the others arrive on Earth where they are taken by Kurn to meet with the Klingon Chancellor Worf. However, Kurn and Worf's guards are soon revealed to be Changelings and kill Worf. They were able to escape with help from a shuttlecraft piloted by Miles O'Brien. Sisko then rendezvous on the Resistance outpost planet Paradise with his son Jake and Jadzia Dax. Dax then asks Sisko about the status of Kira, saying she thought he would rendezvous with Kira after she found the Reckoning Tablet and Sisko says it's imperative they find her and the tablet as it's the only hope left to defeat the Dominion. Later, Sisko becomes host to the freed Prophet and after examining the Prophet's memories, Sisko insists that they must head back to Terok Nor immediately. The Defiant arrives just in time to see the Enterprise enter the wormhole. Dukat hails them and taunts them into following him beyond the event horizon. Though Kirk insists they follow, Sisko overrules him as the Pah-wraiths rule the dimension in the wormhole and are too powerful to be fought, but Kirk reiterates his opinion to rally and follow Dukat when Q appears saying he supports Sisko and explains the truth of why he brought the Enterprise to the future. At the nexus of the wormhole, Q explains to Kirk and Sisko that he is both powerless and at a loss. He had hoped the Prophet might be able to defeat the Wraiths, but Sisko reveals he lacks the power to do so. Dukat then transports Q, Kirk, Spock and Sisko aboard the Enterprise as his prisoners. As even the Wraiths are powerless inside the nexus, Dukat grabs a phaser and kills Sisko, who uses his dying breath to transfer the Prophet into Spock who then transfers the Prophet into Q through a mind meld causing the two beings to merge into an even more powerful entity. Q then uses his newfound powers to snuff out both the Wraiths and Dukat with little more than a thought.
