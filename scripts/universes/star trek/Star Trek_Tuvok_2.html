<html><p>His youngest child, Asil, was born in the city of T'Paal. Tuvok's friend Kathryn Janeway attended Asil's kolinahr. (VOY: "Fury", "Unimatrix Zero, Part II")

Due to his status as the only parent on Voyager, Tuvok was often approached by others for advice on being a parent. Talking with Neelix, Tuvok noted that fatherhood brought so many responsibilities that only the most committed should enter into it given the overwhelming nature of the experience, even as he admitted that it could offer infinite rewards and he often thought about his children despite their distance. When Samantha Wildman was concerned about how her daughter would cope if she died on an away mission, Tuvok noted that he had faith that the rest of his family would care for his own children despite his prolonged absence, assuring Samantha that her own daughter would be cared for by the rest of the crew if she died here. When Tom Paris learned that he was going to be a father, Tuvok noted that Paris should expect paradox due to the complexity of having children. (VOY: "Elogium", "Once Upon a Time", "Lineage")

Romance
Despite being a married man, Tuvok once did become close to a young woman, Noss, while he and Tom Paris were stranded on an inhospitable planet for a number of months. However, after he was rescued, he explained to her that they could only be friends, although he did form a mind meld with her to share his feelings for her. (VOY: "Gravity")

In 2373 Harry Kim fell in love with a computer subroutine on the holodeck named Marayna. Knowing that his attraction to a hologram was nonsensical and would lead to nowhere, Harry sought the guidance of Tuvok in order to suppress his feelings for her. Tuvok began giving Harry advice on how to detach from those uncomfortable feelings when he himself, upon meeting Marayna, became strangely attracted to her. Marayna's fresh thoughts, pure logic, and intelligence were appealing to Tuvok who began to understand Kim's attraction to her. Much to Kim's dismay, Tuvok spent hours on the holodeck talking to Marayna about anything from hydro sailing to logic. It was soon discovered that Marayna was actually a projection of a lonely alien in a nearby nebula. She became obsessed with Tuvok and wanted him to join her or else she would destroy the ship. After talking to her, Tuvok convinced her that his life on Vulcan and duty to Voyager meant that he would never be able to stay with her for the reasons she wanted him to remain, forcing her to abandon her assault on Voyager. Before departing, Tuvok suggested that she should return home and surround herself with the people in her life as obviously her need to project herself like that into others' lives was evidence of a greater need for companionship. (VOY: "Alter Ego")

Mental health
On many occasions Tuvok, and the crew of Voyager, were subjected to brain trauma and tampering. (VOY: "Waking Moments", "Persistence of Vision", "The Killing Game", "Scientific Method", "Workforce", "Workforce, Part II", "Bliss", "Unforgettable", "Repression", et al.).

Towards the end of Voyager's journey it was established that Tuvok's neural peptides were deteriorating due to an unspecified degenerative neural condition that could only be cured by Fal-tor-voh, a particularly intense mind-meld with a member of his family.

In an alternate timeline, his declining mental state could not be treated due to his returning home with Voyager too late for him to receive proper treatment which would require a blood-relative. In this alternate timeline he suffered severe mental damage and lived in a mental hospital, writing an unspecified novel and sometimes experiencing moments where he thought he was still on Voyager. However, due to the intervention of Admiral Janeway from this same alternate timeline, Tuvok arrived back in the Alpha Quadrant with the rest of the Voyager crew in time to receive his treatment. (VOY: "Endgame")

Holograms
Tuvok has been holographically duplicated on a number of occasions.

Recreations of crew members from Voyager and the Jupiter Station Holoprogramming Center were seen by The Doctor during a holographic malfunction in 2371. This simulation, or daydream, included Tuvok. (VOY: "Projections")
The entire crew of Voyager was recreated by Tuvok for his Insurrection Alpha program, including himself. In addition to acting as Tuvok would, this version was also a training guide in the program. (VOY: "Worst Case Scenario")
The Kyrian Museum of Heritage in the 31st century used the program The Voyager Encounter to detail their encounter with the warship Voyager, as an aid to a history lesson. In the heavily-flawed version of events, Tuvok was still Voyager's tactical officer but was shown taking a sadistic glee while attacking the Kyrians. (VOY: "Living Witness")
Lt. Barclay recreated most of the crew of USS Voyager at the Communications Research Center on Earth for the Pathfinder Project in 2376. (VOY: "Pathfinder")
In 2378, Seven recreated the crew of Voyager, including Tuvok, to improve her social skills. (VOY: "Human Error")
The Doctor's holonovel Photons Be Free was set aboard the USS Vortex and crewed by characters based on the crew of USS Voyager, albeit the names were change to protect the innocent. The character of Tulak was based on Tuvok. (VOY: "Author, Author")
Alternate timelines
During the Year of Hell, when the Krenim attacked Voyager with temporal weapons, Tuvok found an active warhead lodged in the hull. Tuvok was sure it would explode in minutes, but Seven wanted to learn its temporal variance so they could perfect shielding against it. She made a determination just before the torpedo blew up, but the explosion blinded Tuvok for the rest of the year. This timeline was undone when the Krenim weapon ship was destroyed and the timeline restored. (VOY: "Year of Hell")

In the original test of the quantum slipstream drive, Tuvok and the rest of the crew – with the exceptions of Chakotay, Harry Kim, and (technically) The Doctor – were killed when Voyager crash-landed into an ice planet. (VOY: "Timeless")

In Admiral Janeway's timeline, Tuvok's degenerative neurological condition became incurable before they could reach the Alpha Quadrant, with the result that he was confined to a psychiatric facility, his memory erratic as he constantly scribbled down various writings. (VOY: "Endgame")

In the mirror universe, Tuvok was a Vulcan member of the Terran Rebellion against the Klingon-Cardassian Alliance. (DS9: "Through the Looking Glass")

Memorable quotes
"I will never cease to be amazed by the Human capacity for hyperbole."


"Without the darkness, how would we recognize the light? Do not fear your negative thoughts. They are part of you. They are a part of every living being, even Vulcans."
"You?"
"The Vulcan heart was forged out of barbarism and violence. We learned to control it, but it is still part of us. To pretend it does not exist, is to create an opportunity for it to escape."


"On the contrary, the demands on a Vulcan's character are extraordinarily difficult. Do not mistake composure for ease. How may I be honest with you today?"


"It appears that we've lost our sex appeal, captain."


"I prefer to read, rather than engage in... what do Humans call it? Short talk?"


"Sitting here, attempting to meditate, I have counted the number of ways I know of killing someone using just a finger, a hand, a foot. I had reached 94 when you entered."


"That is a most illogical line of reasoning."
"You better believe it."


"One day your intuition will fail and you will finally understand that logic is primary above all else. 'Instinct' is merely another term for 'serendipity'."


"Had I known this commendation entailed ritual humiliation, I might have declined."


"I don't suppose I should ask why you were undressed."
"I would prefer that you didn't."


"Where are you going? You don't even know what you're looking for."
"I am looking for Mr. Neelix' instinct. Perhaps it is marked."


"I do not experience feelings of nostalgia. But there are times when I think back to those days of meeting Kirk, Spock and the others, and I am pleased that I was part of it."

Appendices
Background information
Tuvok was played by actor Tim Russ. Russ also played the mirror universe Tuvok in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode "Through the Looking Glass", as well as several other roles in Star Trek. The young Tuvok seen in "Flashback" was played by actor Demetris Lawson and the young one seen in "Gravity" by actor Leroy D. Brazile.

Tuvok was the first Vulcan main cast member to appear on a Star Trek series since Spock in Star Trek: The Original Series and the first fully Vulcan main cast member, given that Spock was half-Human.

An initial notion which led to the invention of the Tuvok character was mentioned in a brief list of handwritten notes Jeri Taylor wrote, one of several compilations of notes about developmental meetings she was having with Rick Berman and Michael Piller about the then-forthcoming-but-not-yet-named Star Trek: Voyager. The notes mentioned, "Old person on show." This was expanded in another set of notes Taylor wrote a week later, on 3 August 1993. This document included, in a section called "The Crew", an outline of the character, which stated, "Engineer – An older human male. Vital and energetic, he has the strength and endurance of the younger officers; but is also a reservoir of wisdom and experience. He takes the rebellious young misfit under his wing and tries to help the angry loner to re-adjust." (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 175 & 177)

From that point on, the character became more like the version of Tuvok which was ultimately established. For instance, in another series of notes written by Jeri Taylor and this time dated 6 August 1993, Taylor wrote, "The older Engineer might be something we've never seen before: a black Vulcan. He's about a hundred and seventy, really old, but embraces that. He is a fount of wisdom and strength for the young, angry assistant engineer." (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 182)

According to the VOY Season 2 DVD trivia text version of "The 37's", an early production name for Tuvok was "Vicon". In the first draft script of VOY: "Caretaker", Tuvok was described as "a 150-year-old Vulcan (in Human appearance terms that's about sixty)." In the final draft of the "Caretaker" script, though, this description was simplified to instead refer to him merely as "a Vulcan man."

Assuming the role of Tuvok was relatively easy for Tim Russ. He recalled, "Most of my friends told me I didn't have to stretch very much because I'm like that character in real life." Garrett Wang remembered that when he first met Russ, he joked that Tuvok was one letter away from resembling the name "Tupac", to which he responded, "Rap music is the reason for the fall of Western civilization." 

In "Caretaker" and the first half of season one, Tuvok wore the rank insignia of lieutenant commander, but he was referred to as lieutenant. This costume gaffe was corrected as of "Cathexis".

A Tuvok action figure by Playmates Toys was the favorite toy of Little Donny in the Upright Citizen's Brigade episode "Little Donny Foundation". Little Donny also drew pictures of Tuvok, exclaiming, "Tuvok is never getting home!"

Tuvok is left-handed, and uses a phaser pouch mounted on his right side as opposed to the standard model which mounts the phaser on the left, as can be seen in episodes such as "Unity", "The Raven", and "Renaissance Man".

His Ilari undercover uniform from the third season episode "Warlord" was later sold off on the It's A Wrap! sale and auction on eBay. 

Apocrypha
Lieutenant Commander Tuvok in Star Trek: Elite Force II
Tuvok as Second Officer of the USS Titan
According to the Michael Jan Friedman novel The First Virtue (from Pocket TNG's Double Helix series), Tuvok worked with Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the USS Stargazer around the time of his rejoining Starfleet in the 2350s.

In the Voyager relaunch series of novels, Tuvok was cured of his illness by his son, and was promoted to Commander. He then began teaching at Starfleet Academy with Admiral Janeway.

The character also appears in the Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force video game and its sequel Elite Force II as the commander of newly formed Hazard Teams on the USS Voyager and USS Enterprise-E, respectively.

In the Star Trek: Titan book series, Tuvok was tapped as a Starfleet Intelligence officer while teaching at the academy. He was sent undercover to Romulus to make contact with Ambassador Spock. Coincidentally, Shinzon assassinates the Romulan Senate simultaneously and in the ensuing chaos, Tuvok is jailed before being rescued by the crew of the USS Titan. He provisionally joins the crew as tactical officer after the ship's regular tactical officer, Lt. Commander Ranul Keru, becomes comatose as a result of battle damage; he reasoned that his experiences in the Delta Quadrant would be an asset to Titan and its mission. In the end of the second book of the series, entitled The Red King, Tuvok decides to stay aboard the Titan as second officer & primary tactical officer. He is also given permission to bring T'Pel aboard to live with him on the ship.

In the novel series Star Trek: Destiny, Tuvok's son Elieth is one of billions killed during a Borg invasion of the Alpha Quadrant.

In the Star Trek: The Fall novel The Poisoned Chalice, Tuvok assists Nog and Thomas Riker as part of a Starfleet Intelligence black ops team known as Active Four in investigating the recent assassination of the Federation President, although they soon learn that their team was actually set up to be killed as part of a plan to frame the Typhon Pact – a new organization composed of various Federation adversaries such as the Romulans and the Breen – for the assassination while eliminating the true perpetrators of the Cardassian organization the True Way.

In A Pocket Full of Lies, Tuvok temporarily transfers back to Voyager to help the crew talk with an alternate version of Janeway created during the events of "Shattered" through the manipulation of the Krenim, the encounter helping Tuvok deal with his own grief and rage over his son's death during the Borg invasion.

Tuvok was shown aboard the Titan in a short film for Star Trek The Exhibition.

In the background story for Star Trek Online, Tuvok has resigned his commission from Starfleet by the year 2401 when he joins Admirals Janeway and Chakotay in objecting to Starfleet's inaction in the face of proven Alpha Quadrant infiltration by Species 8472. At a later, unspecified date, Tuvok rejoined Starfleet. He appears as a Rear Admiral and joins the player in the Star Trek Online fourth anniversary episode released as part of the games "Season 8.5" update. He also plays a role in two missions added in the "Season 9: A New Accord" update as the Commanding Officer of the USS Voyager. With the Star Trek Online second expansion, "Delta Rising", Tuvok takes the USS Voyager back to the Delta Quadrant, making contact with a Talaxian colony led by Neelix, and helping to coordinate an alliance of Alpha, Beta, and Delta Quadrant species against a resurgent Vaadwaur threat. As of the release of "Agents of Yesterday," Tuvok and Harry Kim are tied for having appeared in more Star Trek Online missions than any other canon characters.
