<html><p>In the same year, Voyager encountered an ancient spaceship from one of Humanity's first manned missions to Mars floating in a gravimetric distortion. Chakotay instantly recognized the phenomenon, recalling how the Ares IV was lost to it in the early 21st century. He was intrigued by their discovery and more than enthused to be leading the mission to enter the distortion to retrieve the command module. Tom Paris was impressed that Chakotay knew more about the Ares IV than he did. Chakotay remarked that the Mars missions paved the way for the exploration of space and that Lieutenant John Kelly, who piloted the Ares, was one of his favorite childhood heroes. During the away mission, Chakotay also got to engage in another of his interests, paleontology, discovering things contained within the anomaly. Chakotay's obsession with recovering the command module, however, put the lives of the away team at risk. Despite being ordered to immediately leave the distortion because it was becoming too dangerous to stay inside, Chakotay insisted the team haul the module with them, inhibiting their escape and causing them to become trapped. Chakotay was injured when they were trying to leave the anomaly and had to remain on the Delta Flyer while the task of retrieving a component from the command module to fix the Flyer fell on Seven of Nine, who did not share Chakotay's or anyone else's enthusiasm for such sentimental attachments to history. Chakotay expressed his envy when he realized that he could not beam on board the Ares and insisted Seven download the data Kelly had recorded. While Seven was angry with Chakotay for endangering their lives, his and the rest of the crew's enthusiasm for discovery and remembering history effected her and she began to appreciate learning about, remembering and being inspired by history. (VOY: "One Small Step")

In the same year, when Seven overloaded her Human brain trying to download too much information at once from the ship's logs and became delusional about possible conspiracies aboard the ship, Chakotay and Janeway almost came into conflict when she told them two competing conspiracy theories and they became suspicious of each other. When they discovered what had happened, they realised they had come too far together not to trust each other. (VOY: "The Voyager Conspiracy")

When Voyager weathered a neutronic storm the crew filled their time in one of Paris' holo programs. Janeway begins to fall in love with one of the characters but is uncomfortable and embarrased by that. Chakotay, whilst teasing her a little, also encourages Janeway to enjoy the relationship, saying that it's nice to see her having a little fun, sharing that it's something he did with holo programs himself. Janeway took his advise (and that of The Doctor, who advised similarly) and countinued to cultivate a relationship with the holo character. A number of weeks later, when there was a dangerous problem with Paris' program, Janeway wanted to avoid turning off the energy supply to the program, if possible, so the program wouldn't be lost. She said that, while the characters weren't real, the crew's (including her own) feelings for them were. (VOY: "Fair Haven")

Chakotay's love of anthropology brought vital information to Voyager when it was caught in the gravimetric gradient of a planet on which time passes more quickly than in the rest of space. Chakotay launches a probe that records images every ten milliseconds, enabling the crew to see civilisations develop on the planet and track seismic activity caused by the presence of Voyager. He says the information provided by the probe could be the greatest anthropological find of his career. With Seven of Nine, he was also the first the find and translate a message from the planet's inhabitants. When a difficulty transporting The Doctor back to the ship from the planet's surface meant The Doctor was trapped on the planet for years (by the time frame of the planet) and hard to locate, Chakotay, knowing The Doctor's love of opera and concert music, suggests narrowing sensor scans to the arts district. The Doctor is immediately found. (VOY: "Blink of an Eye")

The ship's crew suffered traumatic memories of participating in the massacre of innocent civilians on a nearby planet, believing they had been responsible the atrocity. Chakotay and an away team who first surveyed the planet suffered the most from the memories. At one point Neelix, suffering from these memories and believing himself to be in a firefight, holed himself up in the mess hall and Chakotay had to talk him out of it. The crew discovered the memories were being transmitted by a synaptic transmitter in a structure on the planet that sent neurogenic pulses that caused memories of the massacre to be implanted in anyone who came near. It was a memorial to the victims of the massacre and a reminder to never let such a massacre happen again. Most traumatised, Chakotay and other members of the original away team wanted to dismantle the monument so that others wouldn't have to experience the trauma they had. The memories could not be removed and would always stay with them. Janeway overrulled them, saying that the monument must stand as a testimony to the lives lost. The crew repaiered the structure so that it functioned properly and left a warning buoy orbiting the planet to inform other ships of what to expect. (VOY: "Memorial")

During shore leave on Norcadia Prime, Chakotay and other members of the crew were able to enjoy watching martial combat competitions. Jokingly, he said he was observing it for anthropological research but, being a boxer, he was quite a fan of the local martial art tsunkatse, discussing fighters' statistics with his crewmates. While watching a match, Seven of Nine entered the combat arena, having been kidnapped, along with Tuvok, and forced to fight. Janeway being away from the ship herself, visiting a planet in the neighboring system, Chakotay lead Voyager in finding the ship on which Seven and Tuvok were held and attacked it, despite the ship being stronger than Voyager - in Torres' words, it was "way out of our weight class". As they attacked the ship, Penk, the leader of the kidnappers, commended Chakotay on his fighting spirit. With the help of Janeway returning in the Delta Flyer, they mamaged to extract Seven and Tuvok from Penk's ship. (VOY: "Tsunkatse")

Returning from an away mission in the Delta Flyer, Chakotay is captured by a Borg cube along with Paris, Kim and Neelix. Held in an assimilation chamber, Chakotay manages to keep his team calm, despite their fears of impending assimilation, and organises them to try to find a way to escape. Their efforts are foiled but thankfully they are later rescued by Voyager. (VOY: "Collective")

Like others of his former Maquis fellows, Chakotay's sense of being Maquis was never lost, even after six years on Voyager. When Starfleet managed to get a message to Voyager and Admiral Hayes inquires specifically about the status of the Maquis onboard the ship, Janeway is unsettled by it, saying she has forgotten the former antagonism between Starfleet and Maquis. Chakotay confesses that he hasn't. (VOY: "Life Line")

Towards the end of this year, in response to a request for help against the Borg, Janeway made a plan to inflitrate a Borg vessel and introduce a nanovirus into the Collective. She told Chakotay that, despite having forged ahead in the past without Chakotay's support, she wouldn't follow this through unless Chakotay supported it. Chakotay was unconvinced that Janeway would listen to him even if he didn't support the plan. This time, however, he did supported her, seeing it as a potential way to finally defeat the Borg. However, when Janeway planned on inflitrating a Borg vessel alone, Chakotay, believing it too risky, insisted Janeway agree to take Tuvok and Torres with her. Janeway resisted and Chakotay pushed back. Janeway said she thought she had his unconditional support this time; he replied, "This is the best I can do" and indicated he would take measures to stop her from going alone, if he had to. Janeway agreed to take Tuvok and Torres with her, who were invaluable. As they approached the Borg vessel and Janeway went to join the away team, perhaps realising the seriousness of this mission she reached out a hand to Chakotay, who held it as they both stood and Janeway gave command of the bridge to him. When the away team, in the Delta Flyer, was approaching the Borg vessel to board it, Chakotay attacked the Borg, drawing fire to Voyager and weakening the Borg's shields so the away team could teleport inside.

While Voyager waited at a distance for the away team to complete their mission, Chakotay experienced a little of what it must have been like for Janeway with him as her first officer. With Janeway and Tuvok away, Lieutenant Paris was technically Chakotay's first officer and he approached Chakotay to offer his opinion, as was first officer's duty. Chakotay wasn't immediately interested in listening to Paris who, worried about the away team - especially because his partner, Torres, was part of it - said Voyager should return to the Borg cube immediately to rescue them. Chakotay said they would wait until the away team's mission was complete. Paris, like Chakotay to Janeway, was insistant but overruled by Chakotay, who told him that, for the mission to work, he needed the support of his "first officer", Paris. Paris agreed.

At the right moment, initiating the next stage of the plan, Chakotay commanded Voyager back to the Borg vessel and rescued the away team with the help of an allied ship - and the support of his "first officer". (VOY: "Unimatrix Zero", "Unimatrix Zero, Part II")

The final year (2377-78)
Chakotay's body in a state of temporal flux in 2377
Chakotay's identity as Maquis was still present in his seventh year after being taken from the stuggle in the Demilitarized Zone. When members of Voyager's crew who were Maquis were being attacked one by one, Chakotay became defensive of them and suspicious of the Starfleet part of the crew. In words that caught both Janeway and himself off guard, he referred to the Starfleed part of the crew as "your [i.e., Janeway's] crew", correcting himself when called up on it. He organised the Maquis to work in pairs and to carry sidearms. It transpired that the attacks were being carried out by Tuvok, who, during his time undercover in the Maquis, had had supressed memory commands implanted into him, and now activated, by Bajoran fanatic Teero Anaydis. During the attacks Tuvok mind melded with the Maquis and implanted in them the command to mutiny. Under this mind control, Chakotay and the other Maquis whom Tuvok had attacked successfully hijacked Voyager until Tuvok, awakened by Janeway, performed another meld with Chakotay to free him from Anaydis' influence. (VOY: "Repression")

When The Doctor betrayed Voyager and joined a group of holograms intent on liberating other holograms from organic species and setting up their own homeworld, Janeway believed his program must have been tampered with by the holograms. Chakotay, perhaps because of his experiences joining the Maquis, suggested another possibility: that The Doctor "may have done what he did because he genuinely believes in their cause" and that maybe he had started thinking of the other holograms as his family. As it turned out, Chakotay's perception was correct, but Janeway was unwilling to believe it or that the holograms should be regarded as people. Later, Chakotay piloted the Delta Flyer through the atmosphere of a Demon planet, with Paris and Tuvok in tactical support, and attacked the holograms' ship, saving Torres, The Doctor and five Hirogen from the them. When back on Voyager, Janeway is lenient with The Doctor, feeling partly responsible for his development into someone who could make mistakes, and counts his time with the holograms as an "away mission". (VOY: "Flesh and Blood")

Twice around this time in the journey, Chakotay approached Janeway with Tuvok to express the same concerns they had about possible actions the captain might take. Once, they approached her when she wanted to make an alliance with the Hirogen to find the holograms The Doctor has joined - Tuvok was concerned about the security risk; Chakotay questioned the level of responsibility they had towards this potentially dangerous mission. A few months later, they approached Janeway when she wanted to make an alliance with other ships who were trapped with them in an area of space devoid of stars, planets, or any other source of energy. They both wondered whether Voyager's tactics should rather be like that of the ships that have survived in the void for years: to take supplies from other ships. Janeway overruled them both both times: the first time because she felt partly responsbile for the holograms because she had been the one to give the technology to the Hirogen; the second time because of her committment to Startfleet principles. (VOY: "Flesh and Blood", "The Void")

Chakotay's trustworthiness and respectability - and the vital nature as a unifying presence on the ship - was shown later that year when he restored Voyager to its proper timeline after it was hit by a chronokinetic surge from a spatial rift that shattered the ship into 37 different timeframes seperated by temporal barriers. Some of the timeframes were from before Voyager was in the Delta Quadrant, some up to 17 years into Voyager's future. In order to fix the timeline, Chakotay had to convince members of the crew - most importantly, Janeway, who was from the time they were still enemies - of their predicament and to work together. The task was made harder by the presense of Seska in one of the timeframes, who was working against him yet again. When Janeway realised she might be able to stop Voyager from ever getting trapped in the Delta Quadrant, Chakotay convinced her not to change the timeline, for the sake of all the positive things that had happened to Voyager's crew over the past six years - for example, the liberation of Seven of Nine. When he had finished convincing her, Janeway asked him if, in their shared future, he always lectured her like that, to which Chakotay replied that she needn't worry, she would always have the last word. Chakotay made such an impact on Janeway that, as the parted, she asked if their closeness had ever become romantic. Chakotay said that there were some barriers that they never crossed. When the timeline was restored, Chakotay diverted all of Voyager's power to its deflector system and setting it to a specific frequency, thus using the deflector array as a lightning rod for the energy surge from the spatial rift, burning it out, but avoiding the timeframe shattering. Due to the Temporal Prime Directive, Chakotay, the only one who knows what's happened, couldn't tell anyone about it and Janeway and the crew have to trust him, which they readily do. (VOY: "Shattered")

B'Elanna Torres became pregnant this year, which made Chakotay happy. When Torres was annoyed that people were offering parental advice all the time, Chakotay was there for her, offering some normality, which she appreciated. Chakotay suggested himself as the child's godfather, an offer Torres declined, choosing The Doctor instead, in part because she believed Chakotay didn't really know about raising children. (VOY: "Lineage")

Chakotay disguised as Amal Kotay so he can infiltrate the workforce
While on an away mission with Kim and Neelix, the rest of the crew were kipnapped and made to work on a planet with a labor shortage. The crew were brainwashed so that they could not remeber their past and believed they had lives on the planet. Chakotay and Neelix carried out reconnaissance on the planet, Chakotay assuming the false identity of Amal Kotay and working in the factory where many of the crew were. Together, they managed to liberate Torres, but Chakotay, injured by guards, became trapped on the planet, a fugitive. He then tried to convince Janeway of who she really was, but she turned him over to the authorities. Chakotay appeared saddened when he learned that Janeway was falling in love with someone who lived on the planet. Once caught by the authorities he was brainwashed and order Voyager to return to the planet, where it was ambused. Thankfully, the skeleton crew were able to escape and Chakotay had done just enough to help his brainwashed crew mates begin to question their situation on the planet, find each other and expose those who are performing the brainwashing. (VOY: "Workforce", "Workforce, Part II")

Chakotay, with Kim, look for Friendship 1 at its final destination
After Starfleet worked out a way to communicate with Voyager on a regular basis, they gave the crew their first official mission in seven years: to find Friendship 1, a deep space probe launched by the United Earth Space Probe Agency in 2067 with the purpose of finding other species. The last known location of the prode was close to Voyager's route and, after tracing it to a seemingly uninhabited planet, Chakotay lead an away team to retrive the probe. It turned out the planet was inhabited - by people who had suffered a devastating disaster after using the technology they learned from Friendship 1, and they blamed Humans for it. The inhabitants attacked the away team and Paris, Neelix and Joe Carey were take hostage and Carey was murdered. Chakotay and Kim had to retreat from the planet. Later, Chakotay returned with an away team to rescue the remaining hostages. Dispite now not being compelled to help the planet's inhabitants (because the hostages had been rescued), Voyager reversed the worsed effects of the disaster before resuming its course. (VOY: "Friendship One")

On the way to a scientific conference on  Ledos, Chakotay and Seven of Nine became stranded under an energy barrier on the planet's surface after their shuttle crashed into it. The barrier protected a primative people, the Ventu, from the other inhabitants of the planet but needed lowering in order for Chakotay and Seven escape. Chakotay was fascinated by the Ventu from an anthropological perspective but he and Seven kept their distance because of the Prime Directive. However, Vendu found Chakotay as he rested under a tree, his leg injured during the crash. While with them, he received their hospitality and medicine and learned some of their language. He became concerned about the influence his presence was having on them, however, after members of the tribe started immitating him and incorporating scavaged parts of the shuttle into their dress. Finding themselves with no other choice, Seven and Chakotay asked the Ventu to help them move a large part of the crashed shuttle so it could be positioned correctly and adapted to lower the barrier. They managed to get in contact with Voyager and returned to the ship where they talked about what they thought would now be best for the Ventu: Chakotay advocated for restoring the barrier to allow the people to carry on living undistured by those outside; Seven, while concerned that a culture might be lost, suggested that maybe the outside influence could help a resourceful and intelligent people develop positively. Chakotay questioned how she might know what it best for the people. Janeway agreed with Chakotay and the barrier was raised. (VOY: "Natural Law")

Chakotay was the first to realise things weren't right after Janeway returned from a trip with The Doctor. She was acting unusually and being secerative and Chakotay suspected someone might be impersonating her. He invented a story about her past, mentioning it to her, and when Janeway acted as if it was something that had happened, he knew it wasn't really her. He tried to contact security but was overpowered, sedated and hidden in the morgue. It transpired that The Doctor was the one impersonating Janeway, who had been kidnapped by two Overlookers when she was travelling back to Voyager in the Delta Flyer with The Doctor. The Doctor kept this secret from the crew for fear for the captain's life and was attempting to outwit the crew and take Voyager's warp core to the Overlookers in exchange for Janeway. Thankfully, Tuvok and Paris were able to attack the ship Janeway was hostage on and bring her back to Voyager. (VOY: "Renaissance Man")

During the visit to Ledos a few months previously, Chakotay and Seven became closer. Seven had been attracted to Chakotay for some time but had never told him. Prior to the trip to Ledos, Chakotay had expressed interest in Seven, but very gently, inviting her to a social event hosted in the mess hall. Their closeness increased over the last few months they were in the Delta Quadrant and they became romantically involved with each other. Seven of Nine tried to end the relationship, however, when she learned that Chakotay's growing love for her could cause him pain should she be injured or killed - a pain she didn't want to inflict on him. Chakotay argued with her, reassuring her that the only thing that was certain in the relationship was the love they felt in the present, not a potential future event. (VOY: "Human Error", "Natural Law", "Endgame")

The return home
It was during this time that Admiral Janeway arrived on the ship and helped Voyager return to the Alpha Quadrant. Unsurprisingly, Chakotay got on well with the Admiral, joking together as they worked. Admiral Janeway had come from what was to become an alternative future. For her, Voyager had taken a further 16 years to get home, experiencing tragedy along the way, and she had traveled back in time to help Voyager get home quicker. Admiral Janeway wanted to avoid the tragedies, but her plan was risky, involving traveling through a nebula with high Borg activity. Chakotay trusted the Janeways could be successful, though, telling Seven, "Our chances would be good with one Kathryn Janeway on the bridge, but with two, I'd bet on this ship any day". At one point, the crew felt deceived by Admiral Janeway, who hadn't told them they would be using a Borg transwarp hub to get home (they believed they'd be using a wormhole). Captain Janeway said they should destroy the hub because it would stop the Borg traveling and assimilating people so easily, saving lives, and Voyager would continue on its route through the Delta Quadrant. The whole crew, including Chakotay, were behind her, recognising the family they had on the ship and the value of the journey. Thankfully for them, the two Janeways devised another plan, involving Admiral Janeway sacrificing herself to blow up the Borg in the hub, allowing Voyager to use traverse the transwarp conduits home, destroying the conduits along the way. (VOY: "Endgame")

The Kazon
Chakotay is interrogated by Seska
Chakotay became one of the central figures in the conflict with the Kazon. One of the first encounters took place during the time he was performing the Pakra, a ritual to honor his father's death. A young Kazon, Kar, who was being initiated as a warrior, attacked him while he was alone in the shuttlecraft performing the ceremony. Chakotay destroyed his ship, and both were captured by the Kazon and condemned to die. After escaping their death sentence, Kar killed the maje and was proclaimed a warrior, thanks in part to Chakotay's help. However, Chakotay was warned that next time he met the Kazon, they would not be as lenient and kill him. His next meeting with the Kazon also was a reunion with Seska, who had defected to the Kazon-Nistrim, led by Maje Culluh. They had stolen a module that enabled them to penetrate Voyager's shields. Chakotay was able to board the Kazon ship and destroy the module; however, he was captured and tortured by the Kazon. He was rescued by Voyager, but shortly thereafter, Seska told him that she had extracted his DNA and impregnated herself with it. (VOY: "Initiations", "Maneuvers")

During a constant series of attacks on Voyager by the Kazon, Chakotay suggested to Captain Janeway that Voyager form alliances with some of the Kazon factions and others in the quadrant. This failed when the Trabe, the Kazon's enemies, under the guise of cooperation with Voyager and the Kazon, attempted to assassinate the Kazon leaders at a conference and otherwise didn't show much interest for diplomacy and building coalitions. (VOY: "Alliances")

Shortly after that, Chakotay received a message from Seska that she had given birth to his child, and that Culluh planned to kill her and take the child. Conflicted as to whether he should accept this child into his heart and life given that it was conceived against his will and through deception, he sought the wisdom of his father through a vision quest. In his vision, his father appeared to him saying that the child knows nothing of deception, that it is innocent and that Chakotay must accept him just as centuries ago his ancestors accepted the children of the white conquerors who had forced themselves upon their women; one of whom was a direct ancestor of theirs. Chakotay recognized the wisdom in his father's words and decided to go find his son. Although Seska was not trustworthy, Janeway agreed to try and help him. It turned out to be a trap, however, and Voyager ended up being captured, and the crew stranded on a barren planet with nothing to survive on while the Kazon took the ship and left. Chakotay's knowledge of nature and his Maquis training helped the crew survive. He rescued Kes from the primitive tribe that inhabited the planet. He also helped the crew to elude an enormous eel-like creature that lived inside a cave that they sought shelter in by sealing off the opening as they exited. He also won the friendship of the tribe when he saved one of them from a lava flow. The crew was eventually rescued by Tom Paris, The Doctor and Lon Suder and returned to Voyager to resume their course home. (VOY: "Alliances", "Basics, Part I", "Basics, Part II")

Conflict with the Borg
In 2373, he encountered a group of former Borg drones, who, due to an accident in space, were released from the Collective, and attempted to regain their original identities. Chakotay was seriously injured on this away mission. The group, headed by a Human called Riley Frazier, still maintained the ability to link. They used their link to help heal Chakotay. Frazier told him that there was another group of former drones with whom they were in conflict. She wanted Voyager to help her activate a neural transmitter on the disabled Borg ship so they could link with the dissenting group to establish cooperation and peace in their colony. Janeway refused, so the group used its former link with Chakotay to activate the transmitter. (VOY: "Unity")

This neural link proved beneficial when later that year, Voyager formed an alliance with the Borg. In exchange for right of passage through Borg space, the crew of Voyager agreed to help them fight Species 8472, who were destroying the Borg. Chakotay was against the alliance and he and Janeway had a fundamental disagreement over how to approach the Borg. Chakotay believed her decision to be foolish at best. He did not trust the Borg and believed Janeway made a fatal mistake of entering into any kinds of agreements with them and expecting to come out alive. On numerous occasions he opposed her, believing she was not only underestimating the enemy but that she was also selfish for wanting to arm the Borg with such a powerful weapon. Janeway was disappointed at Chakotay's perceived lack of trust in her, but he remained adamant, stating that safe passage through Borg space was not worth the devastation that would be unleashed on them after the Borg were equipped with such a powerful weapon. After Species 8472 was defeated, the Borg, as predicted by Chakotay, broke the agreement and attempted to assimilate the crew. Chakotay used his neural link ability to sever Seven of Nine, the Borg drone in charge, from the Collective, thus allowing Voyager to escape assimilation by the Borg. (VOY: "Unity", "Scorpion, Part II")

In 2375, Chakotay and Janeway devised a plan to steal a transwarp core from a Borg ship. When Seven was captured, Janeway lead an away team to rescue her. Chakotay, in command of Voyager, attacked the Borg conduit, destroying it. (VOY: "Dark Frontier")

He was also once captured by a Borg ship piloted by child Borg drones that were separated from the collective when the elder Borgs died due to a mysterious illness. With the aid of Seven, he was rescued. (VOY: "Collective")

Alternate timelines
During the "Year of Hell" conflict with the Krenim, Chakotay advised Janeway of the option of the crew abandoning Voyager and traveling through Krenim space in smaller groups. Janeway dismissed the idea and Chakotay was somewhat relieved. Later, Chakotay was captured by Annorax, the commander of the Krenim ship, along with Tom Paris. At first, he helped Annorax, who promised to return Voyager intact to its original timeline if Chakotay gave him enough detail about Voyager's time in Krenim space, so that Annorax could have the right calculations to use in his time weapon. But after Annorax destroyed a species to try to restore the timeline, Chakotay was convinced to help Paris sabotage the ship by transmitting its location to Voyager and taking its weapons off line. This allowed Janeway to crash Voyager into the Krenim time ship and through its destruction restore the timeline. (VOY: "Year of Hell", "Year of Hell, Part II")

In 2375, Voyager was able to apparently perfect their own version of the Quantum slipstream drive to return home, but a potential glitch in the drive prompted Chakotay and Harry Kim to use the Delta Flyer to map the slipstream in advance of Voyager to monitor potential instabilities in the slipstream matrix as it formed. Due to Kim's miscalculation, Chakotay and Kim were the only two people to make it back to Earth while Voyager crash-landed on a Class L ice planet in the Beta Quadrant, killing all aboard. Fifteen years later, Chakotay had formed a relationship with Tessa Omond, who accompanied him and Harry when they stole the Flyer and certain Borg components from Starfleet before setting out to find Voyager, salvaging The Doctor's program and Seven's corpse with the goal of sending modified slipsteam calculations back to before Voyager was destroyed so that the ship could make it home. According to Kim, because of their actions, stealing from Starfleet, and their plans to break the Temporal Prime Directive, Omond, Kim and Chakotay were the most wanted criminals in the galaxy. Despite being pursued by Captain Geordi La Forge and his ship, who damaged the Flyer causing it to suffer a warp core breach, Chakotay was able to buy enough time for Harry to send modified calculations back to Voyager that would disperse the slipstream entirely, stopping the flight before it could reach Earth but cutting ten years off their journey home. As they prepared for the completion of their plan, which would erase the previous 15 years of history - including Omond and his relationship - Chakotay had momentary second thoughts because he loved Omond. Omond reminded him, however, that his heart had always be on Voyager and hoped that perhaps they might still meet in the unwritten future should their plan succeed. (VOY: "Timeless")

Personal interests
Chakotay's quarters
Chakotay didn't use the holodeck often, but enjoyed reading instead. When he did use the holodeck, he enjoyed developing relationships with characters in programs. He also enjoyed boxing in the holodeck, which he said helped him relax. (VOY: "One Small Step", "Fair Haven", "The Fight")

He occasionally took the time to embrace his artistic side, such as creations using colored sand while trapped on "New Earth" and carvings of Native American symbols. (VOY: "Resolutions", "State of Flux")

Spirituality
When younger, Chakotay had little interest in the traditions of his tribe or in spirituality. However, he connected with the spirituality and traditions of his culture as an adult out of respect to his father, who was killed by the Cardassians while defending the planet his tribe lived on, a connection that grew because of his experiences on Voyager far from home. (On one away mission, he actually met the sky spirits his ancestors prayer to.) (VOY: "Tattoo") He carried out rituals, like pakra (to commemorate the anniversary of his father's death) and vision quests, praying and using his medicine bundle. (VOY: "Initiations") He would seek guidance from his animal guide and used a medicine wheel for physical and spiritual healing. (VOY: "The Cloud", "Cathexis") He would pray for others and also acted as a spiritual guide and counsel to others. (VOY: "Initiations", "The Cloud", "Mortal Coil", "Barge of the Dead") He was noncommittal on the existance of an afterlife, stating that he accepted there were "things that can't be scanned with a tricorder". (VOY: "Barge of the Dead") He recognised that vision quests, while spiritual practices, were underlain by science. (VOY: "Sacred Ground") He said that to understand what one experienced in a quest or similar ritual was a process that involved careful consideration of what the elements of the quest were symbolising. (VOY: "Mortal Coil", "Barge of the Dead")

Foods
Chakotay was a vegetarian; one of his favorite meals was mushroom soup. (VOY: "State of Flux") Some foods he hated were carrots and fried food (because it upset his stomach), and he refused to eat pudding because he thought it was slimy. (VOY: "Unforgettable") Neelix was aware of his dietary choices. During a trade mission to the Nar Shaddan in 2377, he did not press the delicacy of falah nectar on Chakotay because the beverage was made from a meat byproduct, even though it would have been a diplomatic gesture; Neelix convinced Harry Kim to try it instead. (VOY: "Workforce")

Chakotay preferred to avoid alcoholic beverages when possible, saying he preferred to "stay in control". (VOY: "In the Flesh"). One of his favored beverages was Antarian cider that he kept a secret stash of hidden in the cargo bay 2. (VOY: "Shattered")

If Seven of Nine's holographic recreation of him was true to life in this regard, Chakotay was an inexperienced cook with poor cooking skills, calling himself more of a "replicator man". (VOY: "Human Error")

Anthropology and paleontology
One of the many reasons he joined Starfleet was to pursue his interests in anthropology and paleontology. He was fascinated by 20th century Earth during Voyager's visit to its 1996 from 2373, and said that if they were trapped there, maybe he'd become an anthropologist. Once, he considered becoming a paleontologist as well. (VOY: "Future's End, Part II", "One Small Step")

While serving in Starfleet, he visited a tomb excavation on Ktaria VII. (VOY: "Emanations")

In 2373, while examining the Distant Origin Theory, Chakotay suggested that the Voth might have evolved on an isolated continent on Earth and that natural disasters could have buried the evidence under water or rocks. (VOY: "Distant Origin")

The depths of Chakotay's thrill for anthropology was perhaps revealed in 2375 when the telepathic pitcher plant tricked the Voyager's crew into its digestive tract by making them believe they were entering a wormhole home. As part of the deception, it made them believe they were going to get what they most wanted when they returned. Chakotay imagined he'd received a full pardon for his actions as Maquis – and a professorship of Anthropology at Starfleet Academy. (VOY: "Bliss")

Chakotay was interested in the early history of space exploration, John Kelly being one of his childhood heroes. So when Voyager got the chance to actually find his ship in 2376, he was more than eager to salvage the craft when he'd found it intact. Too eager in fact – he injured himself, damaged the Flyer and endangered his crew in his attempts to claim the craft before leaving the graviton ellipse it was caught in. Seven of Nine had to beam aboard the Ares IV, to retrieve a component to fix the Flyer, and Chakotay tried desperately to get her to realize how special it was. As a result, Seven played several of Kelly's logs that were left active when she beamed aboard. He was able to use his skills and knowledge of paleontology to explore various other items caught in the anomaly, saying he could happily stay inside it for a long time discovering things about the universe's history. (VOY: "One Small Step")

Later that year, he was very interested in a planet they discovered that moved at an accelerated rate compared to normal space-time. Despite Voyager being trapped in the planet's orbit and in danger, he still had a deployed probe take images as the civilizations developing below, saying it could be the greatest anthropological find of his career. At one point he commented that every second they missed they could be missing "whole civilizations", to which Torres replied "So? We'll catch the next one." (VOY: "Blink of an Eye")

In 2378, Seven and Chakotay were trapped together again, this time on a world inhabited by the primitive "Ventu", who Chakotay was fascinated with. His interest in anthropology helped him to understand their culture, and he even learned many of the phrases in their sign language. (VOY: "Natural Law")

He told renowned Voth molecular paleontologist Forra Gegen he was a scientist too, and spoke of years studying science alongside navigation and starships to Kar. (VOY: "Distant Origin", "Initiations")

Boxing
Chakotay's boxing gloves
Since his time at Starfleet Academy, Chakotay was a fan of boxing. While there, the legendary Boothby helped him train. On Voyager he occasionally ran a program on the holodeck where he would box a Terrellian with Boothby's assistance. He also said that boxing helped him relax.

In fact, in 2375 while running this program an alien species that lived in chaotic space tried contacting him, and used images of the boxing simulation in their communication. (VOY: "The Fight")

He was also a fan of professional sumo wrestling, once getting into an argument about the 77th Emperor's Cup. (VOY: "Latent Image")

In 2376, while on shore leave on Norcadia Prime he came across a martial art called Tsunkatse on. He was quite a fan, discussing various fighters statistics with other members of the crew, and made sure he was able to watch several of the matches live. Although The Doctor didn't approve of Tsunkatse (or boxing, for that matter), Chakotay insisted it was an excellent way to test a warrior's skills and instinct. (VOY: "The Fight", "Tsunkatse")

Personal relationships
Chakotay got along with most of the people he worked with and had many personal relationships among the crews of both the Val Jean and Voyager. On his Maquis ship, people were very informal, so he got to know his crew on a very personal level. He got the respect of the Voyager crew when Janeway put her trust in him by making him first officer and when he decided to re-embrace Starfleet principles. He forged a deep and meaningful friendship with his Captain, but never hesitated to speak up when he believed that she might be making an unwise move. He was also often the liaison between the crew and the Captain, as people trusted him. In the beginning, Chakotay felt that some of his former Maquis crew members might be unfairly judged, so he always had a soft spot for them and did his best to stand up for their interests, especially when he felt that no one else was. 

While he was not the kind of person to hold a grudge, he also knew when to be tough and enforce the rules. On one occasion, when two of his former Maquis friends, Jarvin and Seska, suggested that they would support him if he wanted to mutiny against Captain Janeway, Chakotay told them point blank that if he ever heard them talk like that again, he would personally throw them in the brig. He also occasionally turned to rather unconventional non-Starfleet methods to discipline his former Maquis crew members who had a little more difficulty or were unwilling to adjust to Starfleet standards: on one occasion, when Kenneth Dalby disrespected Tuvok's orders and just walked out on him after he was specifically ordered to participate in special training, Chakotay decided to teach him a lesson "the Maquis way": he walked into the mess hall and knocking Dalby out of his chair, saying that this was the way the Maquis handled situations like this and that he could continue to do it "the Maquis way" until everyone got it. Dalby and other troublemakers got the point and became more cooperative. Situations like this were rare, however, and through his journey aboard Voyager Chakotay was able to remain on good terms with almost everybody. (VOY: "Parallax", "Learning Curve")

Friends
Kathryn Janeway
Chakotay and Janeway share an intimate moment they fear might be inappropriate
From early on in their time on Voyager Chakotay and Kathryn Janeway forged and maintained a relationship based on deep respect and admiration for the other. In fact Janeway once remarked that while just a few years ago she did not even know his name, now she could not imagine a day without him. Chakotay would reassure Janeway when needed and he recognised Janeway as an excellent captain who could face the biggest of challenges. The mutual respect they had for each other was never lost even when they disagreed quite vehemently over command decisions, although their trust for each other was shaken a few times and had to be rebuilt. (VOY: "The 37's", "Scorpion", "Scorpion, Part II", "The Omega Directive", "Equinox", "Endgame")

They got off on a shaky start when they were first trapped in the Delta Quadrant and Chakotay had reservations about destroying the Caretaker's array that was going to leave Voyager and his own Maquis stranded in an unknown part of the galaxy. For the sake of cooperation and survival of both of their crews he submitted to Janeway's authority. (VOY: "Caretaker")

They also shared a certain chemistry that eventually became evident to both of them while they were trapped on a planet in Vidiian space they called "New Earth." The two were infected with a virus that trapped them on the planet, and while Janeway tried to find a cure – as Voyager had continued on its mission – Chakotay preferred to make the planet their home. The two formed a familiarity during their isolation and Janeway invited Chakotay to call her by her first name, Kathryn. After a long day repairing damages caused by a plasma storm, Janeway complained about an ache in her shoulders. Chakotay offered to give her a massage, which she enjoyed until she realized it probably wasn't appropriate for them to become this intimate. She couldn't sleep that night, and when she attempted to "define parameters" about their relationship, Chakotay reassured his allegiance to her whatever their form their relationship would take. In this intimate moment, Chakotay said that he had been a discontented and angry person before he met Janeway. Through a story, he called her "brave and beautiful and very wise" and said he would do "whatever he could to make her burden lighter", putting her needs first. By doing this, he said, he had found peace. After their conversation they held hands across the table. After a cure for their illness was found and they were finally rescued, they silently agreed that certain things were better left behind on the planet, and resumed their respectful and cordial relationship, although their chemistry was still present in the background from time to time. As Chakotay put it at one point, there were "some barriers [they] never cross[ed]". Chakotay continued to called her by her first name, a unique intimacy that no one else on the crew was ever invited to do. (VOY: "Resolutions", "Shattered") 

While accepting and respecting Janeway as his captain, Chakotay never hesitated to speak up and assert himself when he felt that the situation required it or when Janeway was making questionable command decisions. Months into Voyager's journey and after constant attacks by the Kazon, Chakotay urged Janeway to reconsider her position with regard to the Kazon and think more like the Maquis. He felt that Starfleet regulations were too rigid for them to survive their journey through that part of space. He suggested they seek alliances with other sects of the Kazon. Hesitant at first Janeway agreed to reconsider her position. (VOY: "Caretaker", "Alliances") He also did not agree with her decision to bring a Borg drone she had disconnected from the Collective along on their journey through the Delta Quadrant, believing it nearly impossible that Seven of Nine could ever be anything but an automaton. (VOY: "Infinite Regress") 

On another occasion he refused to let her go off alone on a dangerous mission to destroy the Omega molecule after it had been detected by long range sensors. He said to her, "You're asking me to abandon my captain and closest friend without even telling me why". Janeway asked that he trust her, but Chakotay remained adamant, telling her that the mission would succeed if they worked together, not if she just went off on a suicide mission by herself. He emphasized that they were a team and as such she could count on them for support, even if Starfleet orders said otherwise. (VOY: "The Omega Directive") In 2375, he staged yet another intervention when Janeway once again insisted on taking matters into her own hand and going off on a one-way mission to save her crew: they had entered a vast region of space with no stars or systems, and their only way out of the void was through a spatial vortex. The Malon used the vortex to dump their poisonous antimatter waste into the void, which in turn poisoned the species indigenous to that void. Reasoning with the Malon failed and Janeway soon realized that the vortex had to be destroyed so the Malon could not return to it; however, this time she was not willing to sacrifice her crew once again to save another species, like she had done with the Ocampa and the Caretaker's array. Therefore, she decided to stay behind after Voyager passed through the vortex, so she could destroy it. Chakotay did not want to allow her to make such a sacrifice and, working with the crew, he made sure they all refused to carry out her orders. She was outwardly upset at this rank insubordination, but it was evident that she was actually touched by their action. (VOY: "Night")

A similar incident happened towards the end of Voyager's sixth year in the Delta Quadrant, when Janeway, in response to a request for help against the Borg, planned a solo mission to a Borg vessel to introduce a nanovirus into the Collective. Prior to Janeway revealing she'd be going on her own, Chakotay had given his support to her. However, believing this element of the plan to be too risky, Chakotay insisted Janeway take Tuvok and Torres with her. When Janeway said she thought she had his unconditional support this time, Chakotay replied, "This is the best I can do" and indicated he would take measures to stop her from going alone, if he had to. Janeway agreed to to take Tuvok and Torres on the mission.

As they approached the Borg vessel and Janeway went to join the away team, perhaps realising the seriousness of this mission, she reached out a hand to Chakotay, who held it as they both stood and Janeway gave command of the bridge over to him. (VOY: "Unimatrix Zero")

Janeway and Chakotay
One of the most serious conflicts between them occurred during the encounter with the USS Equinox in 2376: the Equinox, which was commanded by Starfleet Captain Rudolph Ransom, had been using sentient nucleogenic lifeforms as fuel for his ship. When Janeway found out about Ransom's actions which violated every Starfleet directive and code of moral conduct, she was disgusted and furious. When the Equinox tried to escape, Janeway, who felt betrayed and enraged about Ransom's atrocious actions, began a relentless hunt, even going so far as to compromise the safety of the ship and its crew to get to Ransom. Chakotay confronted her about the issue, accusing her of having tried to satisfy a personal vendetta at the cost of the ship. Janeway remained relentless, however, and told him that she wasn't going to stand by and let Ransom torture and murder innocent lifeforms just so he could get home a little sooner. Chakotay tried to get through to her but to no avail. When she resorted to torture of one of Ransom's crewmembers in exchange for information, he warned her that he wouldn't let her cross that line again. Upon hearing this, Janeway, blinded by her desire to bring Ransom to justice, relieved him of duty.
