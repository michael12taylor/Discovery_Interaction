Jean-Luc Picard was a celebrated Starfleet officer, archaeologist, writer, historian, and diplomat who served throughout much of the 24th century. The highlights of his career were centered around assignments as commanding officer of the Federation starships USS Stargazer, USS Enterprise-D, and the USS Enterprise-E. In these roles, Picard not only witnessed major turning points of recent galactic history, but played a key role in them also, from making first contact as captain of the Federation's flagship with no fewer than 27 alien species, including the Ferengi and the Borg. 

He also became the chief contact point with the Q Continuum, and served as Arbiter of Succession of the Klingon Empire, where he presided over the investiture of Chancellor Gowron. Picard would expose the Romulan Star Empire as backers of Gowron's chief rivals, later aiding a Romulan underground movement of dissidents to gain a toehold on the Romulan homeworld. He continued to serve as captain of the Enterprise-E, the sixth Federation starship to bear the name, until at least the early 2380s. (TNG: "The Battle", "The Last Outpost", "Q Who", "Encounter at Farpoint", "All Good Things...", "Redemption", "Redemption II", "Unification II"; Star Trek: First Contact; Star Trek Nemesis; PIC: "Remembrance")

Following his command of the Enterprise-E, he rose to the rank of admiral, but later chose to resign from Starfleet, feeling that the organization had strayed from its ideals. (PIC: "Remembrance", "The End is the Beginning")

Early history
Origins
Jean-Luc Picard was born in La Barre, France on Earth to Yvette and Maurice Picard on July 13, 2305. (TNG: "Family", "Conundrum") 

Childhood
He and his elder brother, Robert, spent their childhood tending to their family vineyards with their father. Concerned about the preservation of their familial values, Maurice and his wife educated their sons in the ancient traditions, avoiding, in particular, any superfluous technologies. (TNG: "Family") As a young boy, Jean-Luc watched his grandfather "deteriorate from a powerful, intelligent figure to a frail wisp of a man, who could barely make his way home." (TNG: "Night Terrors") He took piano lessons, but eventually gave it up because he dreaded performing in front of an audience. In his later life, he would regret doing so, because his playing used to please his mother. (TNG: "Lessons", "The Perfect Mate")

One of Picard's childhood heroes was Dixon Hill, a fictional private detective living in the early 20th century. (TNG: "The Big Goodbye") 

A fascination of his that intrigued him well into adulthood was the ship in a bottle. As a boy, he built model airships, and even a model of a Promellian battle cruiser. (TNG: "Booby Trap") Moreover, he was captivated by the Phoenix, the first Human warp-capable vessel, which he admired several times at the Smithsonian Institution, but was never able to touch. (Star Trek: First Contact) 

Picard, reverted to the age of 12
In grade school, Picard remembered singing such children's songs as "Frère Jacques". (TNG: "Disaster") Like his nephew René, Jean-Luc wrote a ribbon-winning report on starships in school. (TNG: "Family") Later in life, he recalled reading about the ancient Bajoran civilizations in his fifth grade reader. (TNG: "Ensign Ro")

Although Maurice intended his sons to work at the vineyards, it became obvious very early that Jean-Luc knew he wanted to join Starfleet, something that his father would never condone, up until his death. (TNG: "Bloodlines") Jean-Luc would later remember that he devoted his childhood to that end, which was like skipping that age altogether. (TNG: "Suddenly Human") His brother would later note that Jean-Luc always sought higher standards, such as becoming president of his school and later a valedictorian and even an athletic champion. Robert was also jealous of seeing Picard being the favored son and getting away after his mischiefs. Sometimes Robert had to bully his younger brother. (TNG: "Family")

Starfleet career
Academy years
Cadet Picard during his Academy years
Jean-Luc caused "quite a stir" by leaving his family's generational vineyard and applying to Starfleet Academy. (TNG: "Family"; Star Trek Nemesis) Although he failed to gain entry on his first attempt, Picard succeeded in his second attempt in 2323. He subsequently became one of the most outstanding cadets in his class. (TNG: "Coming of Age", "The First Duty")

Picard's career at the Academy was difficult, at best – years later, Picard credited Academy groundskeeper Boothby with helping him develop a mature attitude. (TNG: "The First Duty"; VOY: "In the Flesh") Among Picard's friends at the Academy were Donald Varley, Cortan Zweller, Marta Batanides, and an acquaintance called "A.F.", whom he blamed for his failed semester of Organic Chemistry and whose initials Picard carved into Boothby's prized elm. (TNG: "Contagion", "The Game", "Tapestry")

At the Academy, Picard developed an interest in archaeology. His professor, Galen, encouraged him to continue in this field, but Picard ultimately refused his offer of becoming an archaeologist. He would nevertheless keep his interest in the subject, and became to be considered quite knowledgeable in the field. (TNG: "The Chase", "Qpid") It was also during this time he took great interest in studying the Iconians. (TNG: "Contagion")

Picard also excelled in sports. He won the Starfleet Academy marathon in April 2323 on Danula II, becoming the first freshman to win the race. (TNG: "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II"; Picard family album) During a wrestling match, Picard caught a Ligonian with a reverse body lift and pinned him down in the first fourteen seconds. (TNG: "The First Duty")

During his sophomore year, Picard was assigned to training on Morikin VII where he had his first encounter with Nausicaans, who had an outpost on a nearby asteroid. (TNG: "Tapestry")

An Academy photo Picard kept in his study
Picard graduated at the top of his class. He recalled to Wesley Crusher in 2365 that, as he entered the ranks of being an officer, he was "green as hell. And oh, so cocky." (TNG: "Samaritan Snare") Several years after this, in 2379, Picard showed Beverly Crusher a photograph from his Academy days, asking, "remember him?" She replied that "he was a bit cocky, as I recall." By that point in his life, Picard considered his younger self as "a damn fool. Selfish, ambitious, very much in need of seasoning." (Star Trek Nemesis) 

Picard, later told Boothby that if it wasn't for the groundskeeper, Picard would have never graduated. Boothby assured Picard that "you made a mistake. There isn't a man among us who hasn't been young enough to make one. […] You did what you had to do. You did what you thought was best. I just made sure that you listened to yourself." (TNG: "The First Duty")

Early Starfleet career
Ensign Picard stabbed
Shortly after graduation in 2327, Ensign Picard's promising career nearly ended abruptly while he was on shore leave at Farspace Starbase Earhart. During a bar brawl over a rigged game of dom-jot, he was stabbed through the heart by a Nausicaan, and had to undergo emergency surgery to replace his heart. He later related to Wesley Crusher that he laughed after looking down to see the knife protruding from his chest. This event helped him realize how fragile life could be, and thus made him more willing to take risks and make his mark in the universe, which he only realized when Q proposed him to change this event in 2369. (TNG: "Samaritan Snare", "Tapestry")

As an ensign, Picard was posted to the USS Reliant, where he served with Lieutenant Nakamura. (TNG-R: "The Measure Of A Man") Picard served on the night watch on board the Reliant. (PIC: "Broken Pieces") Also while an ensign, Picard was capable of detecting by ear variations in a ship's torque sensors, as such, he was capable of hearing a three micron misalignment. (Star Trek: Insurrection)

As a junior officer, Picard met Walker Keel at an exotic bar on Tau Ceti III, where the two became the closest of friends; they later became friends with Jack Crusher and his fiancée, Beverly Howard. (TNG: "Conspiracy", "Journey's End", "Attached")

Picard demonstrated command abilities early in his career, in particular, when he led an away team on Milika III to save an ambassador. This incident would later be mentioned by Q as one of the crucial events forming Picard's personality. (TNG: "Tapestry")

As a young lieutenant, Picard attended the wedding of Sarek's son, where he briefly met Sarek and Spock for the first and only time before the 2360s. (TNG: "Sarek", "Unification I")

In his career, prior to 2365, Picard had been transferred "dozens of times", each of which was preceded by what he called "the practice of the feast before the transfer." (TNG: "A Matter Of Honor")

Aboard the Stargazer
Picard on the bridge of the Stargazer some years after its loss
Picard was assigned as a helmsman aboard the USS Stargazer. In 2333, Picard assumed command of the vessel when the captain was killed on the bridge. (TNG: "The Battle", "Relics", "Bloodlines") Starfleet awarded Picard a promotion to the post of captain, making him one of the youngest Starfleet officers ever to attain the position. (TNG: "Tapestry") Picard remained in command of the Stargazer for twenty-two years. (TNG: "The Battle")

In 2339, Picard last visited with his archaeology professor, Doctor Galen. At this time in his life, Picard was seriously considering a career in this field of science. (TNG: "The Chase")

In 2342, Picard dated a young woman named Jenice at the Café des Artistes in Paris. However, he became afraid of a possible future relationship and stood up Jenice, who later married Paul Manheim. (TNG: "We'll Always Have Paris")

In 2346, Picard met Miranda Vigo on Earth while he was on shore leave; they were introduced by a mutual friend. Picard described it the as being involved for a short time, detailing that the affair was "all very romantic, very intense, probably because we both knew I would be leaving in two weeks." The two kept in touch for awhile, but never crossed paths again. (TNG: "Bloodlines")

During the Cardassian wars, the Stargazer was involved in a truce offering by the Federation. After making contact with a Cardassian warship, Picard lowered the ship's shields as a gesture of good will, but the Cardassian commander ignored the gesture and disabled the Stargazer's weapons and impulse engines. The Stargazer managed to regroup and flee. (TNG: "The Wounded")

Picard in the early 2350s at Starbase 32
In 2353, Picard was on an away mission when he saved the life of one team member at the expense of another; Jack Crusher was lost in the line of duty. Picard met with Crusher's widow, Beverly, on Starbase 32 to present the body; it was one of Wesley Crusher's earliest memories. (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint", "Coming of Age", "The Bonding", "Violations")

In 2355, the Stargazer was seriously damaged in a battle with an unknown enemy vessel, later discovered to be a Ferengi ship. Picard managed to destroy the enemy vessel using the Stargazer's warp engines in a unique tactical maneuver (later named the "Picard Maneuver"), but was forced to abandon the Stargazer. His actions during the battle were called into question by Starfleet prosecutor Phillipa Louvois, but he was exonerated by the inquiry board and was later awarded the Grankite Order of Tactics (Class of Excellence) for the development of the Picard Maneuver. The encounter with the Ferengi vessel, later known as the Battle of Maxia, eventually came back to haunt Picard. DaiMon Bok, whose son was killed in the battle, twice tried to exact revenge on Picard. (TNG: "The Battle", "The Measure Of A Man", "Bloodlines"; Picard family album from Star Trek Generations)

During his time in command of the Stargazer Moritz Benayoun was his Chief medical officer and undertook a mission to the Fireforest of Calyx. (PIC: "Maps and Legends")

Picard's next command found him responding to a distress call from colonists in the Carnelian minefield around 2363. During this mission he first met Natasha Yar. (TNG: "Legacy")

Commanding the USS Enterprise-D
Picard, shortly after taking command of the Enterprise
In 2364, Picard was assigned command of the newly commissioned Galaxy-class starship USS Enterprise-D, the most prestigious captaincy in Starfleet. He commanded the flagship for seven years, participating in many important missions. Among these were the defeat of the Borg invasions of 2366 and 2373, and his command of the fleet which blockaded the Klingon-Romulan border during the Klingon Civil War.

"Let's see what's out there…"
Picard hand-picked most of his senior staff, such as two young officers who impressed him enough upon first meeting. Geordi La Forge once piloted Picard's inspection tour shuttle and stayed up all night to refit an engine part Picard had made a passing comment on, and Picard witnessed Natasha Yar risk her life to save colonists amid a Carnelian minefield. He had also picked William T. Riker as his first officer and promoted him to commander sight unseen, impressed by the young officer's record of independence. (TNG: "The Next Phase", "Legacy", "The Pegasus")

Mere months after taking command, Picard was offered a promotion to commandant of Starfleet Academy with the rank of admiral by Admiral Gregory Quinn, but turned it down to retain command of the Enterprise. (TNG: "Coming of Age")

Picard on the bridge of the Enterprise in 2370
Although Picard often heatedly defended a strict interpretation of the Prime Directive, he broke it numerous times when he felt it was warranted. Thus, in 2364, he allowed an Edo woman to confront her "god" from space, and in 2366, Picard brought a Mintakan leader aboard the Enterprise to undo the damage done by cultural contamination. (TNG: "Justice", "Who Watches The Watchers", "The Drumhead") Furthermore, in 2370, the Enterprise, by hand of Dr. Nikolai Rozhenko, transported a primitive group of Boraalans into a holodeck from Boraal II before an atmospheric dissipation rendered it uninhabitable. Although in violation of the Prime Directive, Picard ordered that the Boraalans be stealthily resettled, having no other humanitarian options. (TNG: "Homeward")

In 2369, when the Enterprise was undergoing a baryon sweep at the Remmler Array, Picard uncovered a plan, by mercenaries, to steal toxic waste from the ship's warp core. He managed to take out all of the intruders by setting traps throughout the various sections of the ship. He even used the Vulcan nerve pinch technique on one of them. (TNG: "Starship Mine")

Encounters with the Q entity
Commanding the Enterprise on her first mission, Picard made first contact with a member of the Q Continuum – Q. Picard and his senior officers had to stand trial for Humanity's immaturity. To prove their worthiness as a species, Picard had to solve the "mystery of Farpoint Station." The crew of the Enterprise discovered that the inhabitants of Deneb IV, the Bandi, had captured a space-dwelling being to serve their own purpose. The Enterprise helped to free the creature, and Q, somewhat disappointed by the crew's success, retreated, though he hinted that it would not be their final encounter. (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint")

Q explains to Picard that how Humans respond to a game tells him more about them than a direct confrontation would
Thus, later that year, Q created a bizarre and deadly "game" for the crew of the Enterprise in order to demonstrate that he had given Riker Q-like abilities. Ultimately, Riker rejected these new powers, and Q again disappeared. (TNG: "Hide and Q") One year later, in 2365, Q first expressed an interest in joining Picard's crew. When Picard declined, Q tried to show how much he could be of assistance by hurling the Enterprise into the path of a Borg cube. Q was hoping to show that the Federation was entirely unprepared to meet some of the more powerful races that existed in the universe. Ultimately, Picard had to beg for Q's help in escaping from the pursuit of the Borg vessel. (TNG: "Q Who")

A fourth encounter with Q occurred in 2366, when the other members of the Continuum had stripped him of his omnipotence and immortality as punishment for his irresponsibility. He sought refuge on the Enterprise and, although Picard and the rest of the crew were initially unconvinced of the sincerity of Q's pleas, the captain agreed to provide Q temporary asylum. As the Enterprise began to suffer from Calamarain attack, however, Q resolved to end his life to prevent further risk to the Enterprise crew, but another member of the Q Continuum prevented Q from sacrificing himself, and restored his powers as a reward for his selfless act. (TNG: "Deja Q")

Late in 2367, Q returned to the Enterprise to "properly" thank Picard for his role in helping him regain his standing in the Continuum. At the time, Picard was meeting Vash, whom he had met on Risa the year before. Q resolved to teach Picard a lesson about love and cast the captain, Vash, and the Enterprise command crew into an elaborate scenario styled by the ancient legend of Robin Hood. Q himself assumed the role of the High Sheriff of Nottingham. Ultimately, Picard learned his lesson, and everyone was returned to the Enterprise. Intrigued by Vash, though, Q offered to take her on a journey of exploration to explore various archaeological ruins of the galaxy, and she accepted. (TNG: "Qpid")

In 2369, Q once again appeared aboard the Enterprise, this time to instruct Amanda Rogers, a Human who was the child of two Q and possessed Q powers herself. Although Q's petulant and acerbic attitude did little to ingratiate himself to Amanda, he eventually convinced her to go with him to the Continuum to learn to use her new-found abilities. (TNG: "True Q")

Later that same year, Q appeared to Picard when the latter was critically injured during an ambush from a group of Lenarians. Appearing as "God", Q told Picard that he had died because of his artificial heart, and offered him the chance to return to the incident in his youth, allowing him to relive the events leading up to his near-fatal injury and change history. Although Picard was successful in changing history, he eventually realized that the event – and his previous nature as an arrogant, brash young man – was a part of his identity, and had helped mold him into the successful Starfleet officer he had become. Although he was uncertain as to whether the experience had been real or simply a vision, Picard was grateful for Q's revelation. (TNG: "Tapestry")

"You don't get it, do you, Jean-Luc? The trial never ends."
In 2370, Q returned to the Enterprise to continue the trial against Humanity. Claiming that the seven-year-old trial had never actually ended, Q proclaimed Humanity guilty of "being inferior" and informed Picard that his race was to be destroyed. He sent Picard traveling through time to his past, present, and future, where he was presented with a temporal paradox in the form of an eruption of anti-time in the Devron system. In this paradox, Picard himself was responsible for the creation of the anomaly that propagated backwards in normal time (anti-time having the opposite properties of normal time), thus destroying Humanity in the past.

However, in addition to sending Picard jumping through time, Q also provided Picard with hints to understanding the nature of the paradox. Ultimately, Picard determined the solution and devised a way to close the anti-time anomaly in all three time periods. Following the captain's success, Q revealed that the entire experience had been a test, aimed at determining whether Humanity was capable of expanding its horizons to understand some of the advanced concepts of the universe. Departing, Q promised to continue watching Humanity, proclaiming that "The trial never ends." (TNG: "All Good Things...")

Encounters with the Borg
Abducted by the Borg in 2366
In 2365, Q sent the Enterprise 7,000 light years into uncharted space, into the path of a Borg cube. Although the Enterprise suffered losses, it became the first ship known by the Federation to survive an encounter with the Borg, and managed to inform Starfleet of the Borg's existence. (TNG: "Q Who")

One year later, in 2366, the Borg launched their first invasion of the Federation. A single cube destroyed the New Providence colony and the USS Lalo, and kidnapped Picard when the Enterprise attempted to intervene. Picard was partially assimilated and became a Borg drone known as Locutus of Borg. The cube proceeded towards Earth and engaged Starfleet in the Battle of Wolf 359, resulting in the destruction of 39 Federation vessels. On arrival at Earth, an away team from the Enterprise successfully rescued Picard and used his connection to the Borg to implant false data in the cube, destroying it. (TNG: "The Best of Both Worlds", "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II") It was revealed years later that his assimilation and time spent in the Collective had a profoundly disturbing effect on Picard's life. (Star Trek: First Contact)

Picard as Locutus of Borg, and the Borg Queen
The Enterprise again encountered the Borg in 2368 when they rescued a Borg drone from a crashed Borg shuttle. This drone was cut off from the Collective and slowly regained an individual identity, eventually being named Hugh. Initially, the plan was drafted to use Hugh to destroy the collective in its entirety, although Dr. Beverly Crusher resisted the extermination of an entire race – even if it was the Borg. Picard eventually confronted Hugh, who immediately recognized Picard as Locutus. Picard took the role of Locutus while talking to Hugh, to simulate the authority that Hugh was used to. However, Geordi La Forge, Data, Dr. Crusher, and other members of the Enterprise crew had a profound effect on the former drone. Even Guinan, who initially wanted nothing to do with Hugh, taught him that resistance is not futile. Guinan's homeworld had been destroyed long ago by the Borg, but the fact that Guinan was still alive was proof of this assertion.

When Picard reminded Hugh that "resistance is futile," Hugh informed him that it was not so. When Picard told Hugh that La Forge would be assimilated, Hugh stated that La Forge did not want to be assimilated. When Picard said that this was irrelevant, Hugh specifically said that he (and Hugh used the word "I") would not assist in the assimilation of La Forge. Picard was stunned that a Borg drone would say such things. He decided that he could not send Hugh back with the file that would destroy the Borg. Picard offered Hugh asylum on board the Enterprise, but Hugh said that the Collective would not stop looking for him until they found him. Hugh agreed to go back to the crash site and to be taken back into the Collective, to protect the Enterprise from harm. (TNG: "I Borg")

The individuality present in Hugh spread through the ship he returned to, causing a catastrophic separation of the ship from the rest of the Collective. This rogue mini-collective was unsure how to cope with its freedom, and so fell under the influence of the android Lore. Lore persuaded them to aid his plan to conquer Earth. Using the rogue ship, they attacked several outposts before being tracked down by the crew of the Enterprise-D. They destroyed the Borg ship and were able to persuade the remaining members of the mini-collective of Lore's unreliability. The mini-collective then disappeared into space and has not been encountered since. (TNG: "Descent", "Descent, Part II")

There were some within Starfleet who blamed Picard for the destruction of the task force at Wolf 359. Benjamin Sisko, who was serving as first officer of the USS Saratoga at the time, lost his wife Jennifer in the attack. Picard and Sisko finally met in 2369, after the Enterprise was the first Starfleet vessel to arrive at Deep Space 9. Sisko was, at first, hostile toward Picard, but later came to forgive him. Sisko also gave Picard his letter of resignation, which Picard did not send, feeling Sisko was the right person for command of Deep Space 9. (DS9: "Emissary")

Meeting the Borg Queen again
In 2373, the Borg launched their second invasion of the Federation, and again the crew of the Enterprise played a major role in their defeat. Initially, the Enterprise was not to have participated in the Battle of Sector 001, because according to Starfleet Command, Picard would bring an "unstable element into a critical situation." Seeing that the Borg were getting the best of the fleet, Picard ordered the Enterprise to Earth to assist. He was instrumental in defeating both the main invasion and an attempt by the Borg to prevent the formation of the Federation by altering history. (Star Trek: First Contact)

Kamin and the Ressikan probe
Picard plays his Ressikan flute in private
In 2368, the Enterprise encountered a space probe of unknown origin, which emitted a nucleonic beam directly at Picard. This led to his fainting and awakening on an unknown world where he was known as an ironworker named Kamin and was married to Eline. Picard later found out that Kamin was a member of the Ressik community on a planet called Kataan. For five years, Picard clung to his life aboard the Enterprise and searched for ways to return, but eventually settled into his life as Kamin, having two children with Eline and eventually a grandchild. In the approximately thirty-five years Picard spent as Kamin, he learned to play the Ressikan flute, dabbled in astronomy, and analyzed soil samples from the planet, eventually confirming that Kataan was a dying world.

Near the end of his life on Kataan, it was revealed to Picard that Kataan had been destroyed more than a thousand years previously, and the residents of the Ressik community had engineered the probe to share the memory and experiences of their people with someone who could then teach others about their civilization. He awoke on the Enterprise as Jean-Luc Picard once more and discovered that he had lived a lifetime in only twenty-five minutes. The probe was collected by the Enterprise and disassembled. A Ressikan flute was found inside the probe, which Riker then presented to Picard. (TNG: "The Inner Light")

Picard considered the flute to be one of his most prized possessions. As of 2379, he kept the flute on his desk in his ready room aboard the USS Enterprise-E. (TNG: "Lessons"; Star Trek Nemesis)

Loss of the Enterprise-D
Picard in command of the Enterprise-E
In 2371, the USS Enterprise-D was lost over Veridian III, with the vessel's primary hull crash-landing on the planet's surface. Picard also met the legendary James T. Kirk while in the Nexus with him, and recruited him in defeating and killing Dr. Tolian Soran before he could have the chance to destroy the Veridian system. The casualties were light aboard the Enterprise, and most of the ship's senior crew was reassigned to the USS Enterprise-E, the sixth Federation starship to bear the name. (Star Trek Generations; Star Trek: First Contact)

Commanding the USS Enterprise-E
Stopping the Borg
Picard was installed as commanding officer and given a new authorization code: "Picard-4-7-alpha-tango." After a one-year shakedown cruise, the new Enterprise was nearly lost when the senior staff decided to sacrifice the ship in order to save Earth's future by preventing the Borg on board from changing history. Fortunately, the crew was able to repel the Borg attempt without having to destroy the Enterprise. (Star Trek: First Contact)

The Ba'ku and the Son'a
Two years later, in 2375, Picard ordered the Enterprise-E to the Ba'ku planet in the Briar Patch when it appeared that his operations officer, Lieutenant Commander Data, had malfunctioned and assaulted members of the research team there. Picard was able to capture Data and uncovered a plot by Admiral Dougherty, the Son'a and some in the Federation Council to relocate the Ba'ku against their will. Picard rebelled against Dougherty, bringing word of his actions to the public. Picard was able to protect the Ba'ku and stop Son'a leader Ru'afo from destroying the Ba'ku's homeworld. (Star Trek: Insurrection)

Dealing with the Romulans
Picard and a dying Shinzon
Picard continued in command of the Enterprise through 2379, when the ship was sent to Romulus after the coup by Praetor Shinzon. Shinzon was a clone of Picard created by a former Romulan government – they intended to replace the captain with a spy of their own. Following a change of government and concern that it would lead to war, the plan was abandoned and Shinzon was sent to Remus to die. Instead, he prospered, becoming a highly successful leader during the Dominion War. Shinzon used a thalaron radiation weapon to eradicate the Romulan Senate and had planned to do the same to Earth. He needed Picard in order to repair faults in his own genetic makeup.

In a pitched battle between the Enterprise and Shinzon's flagship, the Scimitar, Picard was eventually able to board the enemy ship and eliminate Shinzon. Data saved Picard's life by transporting the captain back to the Enterprise before sacrificing his own life; he destroyed the Scimitar by firing on the thalaron weapon with a hand phaser, thereby saving the crew of the Enterprise. (Star Trek Nemesis)

Later career
In 2380, Q remarked that Picard was "no fun, he's always quoting Shakespeare, he's always making wine." (LD: "Veritas")

By 2385, Picard had been promoted to admiral and left the Enterprise to develop a fleet of ships to help rescue the populations of Romulus and other worlds of the Romulan Star Empire that were within the blast radius of an impending supernova. The Romulan government had requested the Federation's aid in this. (PIC: "Remembrance") 

Sometime later, Picard had managed to help get some of the Romulan refugees to Vashti, in the Beta Quadrant. He visited the planet several times and on one occasion, brought Elnor, a young Romulan boy he had befriended and placed under the care of the Qowat Milat, a copy of the book The Three Musketeers, and on April 5, 2385, began to teach him to fence. During the lesson, Raffi Musiker informed him that the rescue fleet under construction on Mars was under attack by rogue Synths. Picard, shocked at the news, bid farewell to the Qowat Milat and told them that he would try everything within his power to make sure the rest of their people could be saved. (PIC: "Absolute Candor") 

Admiral Picard speaks with Commander Musiker about his meeting with the Federation Council
The attack destroyed not only all the ships of the rescue fleet but also Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards and ignited the stratosphere for years to come, rendering the terraformed planet uninhabitable. Picard called the attack, which cost over 92,000 lives, "devastating" in a Federation News Network broadcast at the time. Following this, the Federation chose both to enact a ban on the creation of synthetic life forms and to cancel the Romulan evacuation, dooming the majority of the population to death by the eventual supernova in 2387. Picard met with the Federation Council with a plan for a new fleet, with "mothball ships" and significantly fewer officers but believed the evacuation could still work, he gave the council a choice: his new fleet or his resignation.

In truth, his threat to resign from Starfleet was the last, desperate card Picard had to play to continue the evacuation plan, and he was stunned when the council simply accepted it. Picard called the ban on synths "a mistake." His resignation angered Raffi Musiker, who had believed in his idea and suspected possible Tal Shiar involvement in the attack on Mars. (PIC: "Remembrance"; ST: "Children of Mars"; PIC: "The End is the Beginning"; Star Trek)

Retirement
Following his resignation, Picard returned to his childhood home in France where he lived a pleasant but unfulfilling life. Living with him were two Romulan refugees Laris and Zhaban who joined his household about four years later, and also his dog Number One. He spent the next twelve years writing history books and tending to the vineyard. As the years wore on, Picard started to be plagued with dreams of Data and the destruction of Mars. (PIC: "Remembrance")

Zhat Vash mystery
Picard meets Dahj
In 2399, now ninety-four years old, Picard was sought out by Dahj Asha, an android created from the remaining neural code from Lieutenant Commander Data. After having a dream about Data painting, he went to his vault inside the Starfleet Archive Museum to inspect a painting that Data had given him in 2369. After seeing that the woman in the painting resembles Dahj, Picard sought out cyberneticist Dr. Agnes Jurati at the Daystrom Institute to seek more information about the mysterious young woman. Jurati told him that Bruce Maddox might have managed to create androids based on Data's code, including Dahj and a "twin" sister. Dahj reunited with Picard at the institute where he explained to her what he had learned. They were chased by Romulan operatives and Dahj was killed. (PIC: "Remembrance")

Back at Château Picard, Laris, Picard and Zhaban reviewed the security footage from Starfleet Headquarters where Dahj was killed. The computer told them that there was no trace of Dahj. This lead Laris to believe that the Tal Shiar or even the Zhat Vash are behind this, covering up their tracks. Soon after, Picard and Laris investigated Dahj's apartment in the greater Boston area. They discovered that their fears were true and the Zhat Vash were behind the events that were unfolding. Later that night,  Dr. Moritz Benayoun visited Picard to inform him that he could not clear him for interstellar travel despite passing all the tests that Starfleet require, save for abnormality in the parietal lobe in his brain. Picard went to Starfleet headquarters to speak with Fleet admiral Kirsten Clancy to be reinstated. Explaining the situation he was denied his request. Later, Picard was visited by Dr. Jurati and she informed him that Dahj's background had been created within the last few years and there was no record of her before then. Picard later sought the help of his former first officer Raffi Musiker to help assemble a crew to go find Bruce Maddox and solve the Zhat Vash mystery. (PIC: "Maps and Legends")

Picard orders Rios to head to warp
Picard was able to get Raffi to agree to help after having a heart-to-heart with her. He apologized for letting her down and not being there when she needed him most. She put him in contact with Cristóbal Rios, the experienced pilot and CO of La Sirena. He beamed aboard his ship, Noticing how neat he kept his ship, he deduced that he was a former Starfleet officer. After the introductions were finished, Picard headed back to Chateau Picard. While speaking with Laris, he revealed that he never really felt at home at the Vineyard and always felt he was best served out among the stars. After Zhaban entered with groceries, the three were attacked by Zhat Vash agents. They defeated them but one entered the room to shoot Picard but was killed by Agnes Jurati. She told Picard that Commodore Oh visited her and asked her about what she told Picard. Picard then interrogated one of the Romulans and learned that they believed that Soji is "the destroyer" before the group could learn more, he committed suicide via acid. Picard then beamed aboard Rios's ship, surprised that Raffi was there. She told him that she had found out where Bruce Maddox was –Freecloud, based on the information that he gave her. Picard ordered Rios to jump to warp to begin their mission. (PIC: "The End is the Beginning")

Picard speaks with Elnor on Vashti
Picard decided to change course to Vashti, he wished to visit the Qowat Milat there and see how they were doing. Feeling he owed it to them. Raffi had informed Picard that it was not like he had left it. Becoming grimmer since he had left and the destruction of the Romulan homeworld left many bitter at the Federation. Once there, he reunited with Elnor, who was at odds with Picard, feeling he had abandoned him and his people. Picard, in an attempt to help solve the tension, spoke with some of the Romulans there, which lead to a conflict. When challenged to a duel, Picard declined. Elnor, came from behind and decapitated the opposing Romulan, pledging himself to Picard's mission. Once arriving back on La Sirena, Picard scolded Elnor for killing the man. Soon, they were shot at by an old Romulan Bird-of-Prey. During the fight, a mysterious ship appeared to help them. Once the bird of prey was disabled and the other pilot's ship almost destroyed the pilot was beamed aboard, revealing herself to be Seven of Nine. Picard acknowledged her to which she quipped, "You owe me a ship, Picard.", before passing out. (PIC: "Absolute Candor")

Picard in his bounty hunter disguise
Later on, Seven and Picard spoke in his office about what he was doing out this far. He told her that he was trying to help someone before danger came to her. Upon arriving at Freecloud, Picard and the others came up with a plan to extract Bruce Maddox. Picard played the part of a bounty hunter who brought Seven of Nine to meet Bjayzl. During the meeting, Seven reveals that she is there for revenge only and attempts. to kill Bjayzl. Upon arriving back on La Sirena, he spoke with Seven about their time in the Borg Collective and if they both truly gain their humanity back, he told her he is one day at a time to which she agreed. Later he met with Maddox in sickbay. Maddox revealed that Soji was on the Artifact. (PIC: "Stardust City Rag")

Picard and Hugh share a hug upon meeting again after many years
After discussing the death of Bruce Maddox with Agnes Jurati, Picard become enraged at the thought of the Borg perhaps being different now, he went to his office and had the computer search for some keywords, "treaty, neutral zone, artifact and Borg. He discovered that Hugh was now the director of the Romulan Reclamation Site. Picard needed to get on the Artifact so he had Raffi Muskier convince Captain Emily Bosch to clear Picard for a 24-hour Ambassador clearance. Once on board the cube, he began to have horrific flashbacks about his time as Locutus of Borg. Two xBs stopped Picard from falling to which he mistook for an attack. Hugh then made his presence known and told Picard they were saving him from falling. Hugh then showed Picard around the Artifact. After learning what Hugh and the Romulans were doing, he enlisted Hugh in helping him to find Soji. They went to her quarters to find a mess and when they tried to track her again, her signal could not be found. While searching the cube for her, Soji dropped out of the celling and Picard told her about how he was too late to save her sister but still had time to save her. Picard, Hugh and Soji fled from Romulans to the queencell. With Romulans at the door, Elnor came to the rescue, after Picard had told him to stay on the ship. When the spatial trajectory device was ready, Soji and Picard walked through, transporting them to Nepenthe, after telling Rios to meet at their coordinates. (PIC: "The Impossible Box")

Picard shares a moment with Riker
Upon arriving on Nepenthe, Picard and Soji were greeted by Kestra Troi-Riker, the daughter of William T. Riker and Deanna Troi. They walked the residence. Once they got to the Riker residence, Picard was gleefully greeted by Deanna and later Will. Picard explained the situation to them and they welcomed him and Soji to stay as long as they needed. During the visit, Picard spent time with Will and sought advice from him and Deanna. Picard reminisced about the Riker's late son Thaddeus Troi-Riker with Deanna. He remembered the time he held him when he was an infant and how he liked to create languages. At dinner, while discussing what Narek had Soji do to bring up the information he needed from her, Kestra discovered the planet they were looking for and they agreed Picard and Soji needed to find it. (PIC: "Nepenthe")

Picard speaks with Soji about her past and Commander Data on board La Sirena.
After getting back to La Sirena and making introductions, Picard asked Rios to plot a course for Deep Space 12 and to get him a secure channel to Starfleet Command. In his office, Picard spoke with Admiral Clancy about Soji and the other possible synths and asked for a squadron to travel to the Vayt sector. He proceeded to add arguments to his cause before Clancy bluntly shooshed him, telling him that a squadron would meet him at DS12. After this, Picard spoke with Dr. Jurati in sickbay, where she confessed to the murder of Bruce Maddox and agreed to surrender herself to the authorities. Later, Raffi revealed to everyone what she had pieced together about the Romulans, the attack on Mars and the synths, prompting Soji to leave and change the course of the ship by hacking the system. Picard accompanied Rios to the bridge where he bypassed a force field Soji put up to confront her. The crew discussed their next move and they eventually all agreed that following Soji's plan was the best course of action. (PIC: "Broken Pieces")

"Death" and resurrection
Upon arriving on the synth homeworld of Coppelius, in which La Sirena crashed on the surface, Jurati was able to discover the abnormality in Picard's brain, which he revealed to the rest of the crew as being diagnosed as terminal just before La Sirena left Earth. However, he made a point of saying he would not be treated like a dying man, and they would continue with the mission. As he had promised, he delivered Soji to her people at Coppelius Station, a community of synths led by Dr. Altan Inigo Soong, the son of Data's creator Noonian Soong. Picard and Soji told the assembled synths that the Romulans were en route to their world to destroy them. Picard sent a secure message to Starfleet informing them that he had made first contact and requested diplomatic negotiations and Starfleet protection for Coppelius and its inhabitants. However, the synth community, led by Sutra, had come to another conclusion: They had discovered that the "Admonition" that the Zhat Vash believed to be a warning against synthetics was in fact a message meant for synthetics, to call for help from a hidden race of advanced artificial lifeforms to preserve their existence… even if it meant exterminating organic life in the process. In order to stop him from trying to instill doubt in the others, Soong and Sutra ordered that Picard be held under house arrest. (PIC: "Et in Arcadia Ego, Part 1")

Picard was eventually rescued by Jurati, and the two of them traveled to La Sirena; unbeknownst to them, the others had returned to Coppelius Station to stop the construction of the transmitter. Having learned the ship's controls from his observations of Rios, Picard was able to take the ship back into orbit and face down the Romulan fleet, led by Commodore Oh, now revealed as a Romulan general. A fleet of Starfleet ships, led by Riker aboard the USS Zheng He, arrived in response to Picard's transmission, informing the Romulans that Coppelius was under Federation protection. Picard pleaded on an open channel with Soji, who was working to build the transmitter, to not become the "Destroyer" that the Romulans believed her to be. Finally giving in, Soji destroyed the transmitter, leaving the Romulans no choice but to withdraw in the face of the overwhelming Starfleet force. With Coppelius saved, Picard collapsed, his body beginning to fail as the result of his illness. He was beamed to the planet's surface, where he died in the company of the crew he had led on this mission. However, Soong had been working to create a golem to transfer his consciousness into, and had just completed the work before the Romulans arrived; working with Jurati and Soji, Soong was able to transfer Picard's consciousness and memories into the golem before his brain functions ceased completely. (PIC: "Et in Arcadia Ego, Part 2")

With a second chance at life, he continued on with the crew of La Sirena, noting along with Soji Asha that with the Federation's synthetic ban lifted, they were both free to travel as they pleased. Notably, the golem's neural net did not contain the defect in Picard's parietal lobe that caused the death of his Human body. The android body was built to be identical to his Human body in all other ways, lacking any enhanced physical or mental abilities and having the same remaining lifespan Picard's Human body would have had if not for his brain defect. (PIC: "Et in Arcadia Ego, Part 2")

Legacy
By the 32nd century, Picard's personal files were still part of the Federation and Starfleet databases that survived the Burn. In 3189, the USS Discovery's Chief Science officer, Commander Michael Burnham, examined his files and saw his encounter with her brother Spock on Romulus.
