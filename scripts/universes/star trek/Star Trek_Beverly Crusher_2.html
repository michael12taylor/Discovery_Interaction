<html><p>In 2370, Picard and Crusher were taken captive on planet Kesprytt, and were linked together by psi-wave devices to prepare them for interrogation, but the devices transmitted their thoughts to each other and they learned each other's most intimate secrets. Beverly stayed up one night to listen to Jean-Luc's dreams, and Jean-Luc discovered that Beverly usually always had some smart-aleck comment at the ready, although she had learned to repress the urge to say them out loud. One night, Beverly brought up Jack and feelings of guilt washed over Picard. She finally learned that he too, felt an attraction, but did not act on it out of respect for his dead friend. Once they returned to the Enterprise, Picard expressed desire to further their relationship. However, Beverly ultimately decided that she did not want to ruin their friendship or be placed in a conflict of interest, and they decided to remain mutual friends. (TNG: "Attached")

Alternate realities and timelines
An alternate version of Beverly Crusher was chief medical officer on the Enterprise-D created after the USS Enterprise-C briefly entered the year 2366 through a temporal rift. She strongly objected to the plan to send the Enterprise-C back to its proper time, and wondered if she would even be alive in the restored timeline. (TNG: "Yesterday's Enterprise")

Beverly was also the chief medical officer on several Enterprises in alternate quantum realities visited by Lieutenant Worf in 2370 following his encounter with a quantum fissure. In one such reality, however, Doctor Alyssa Ogawa was the chief medical officer of the Enterprise instead of her, with the rank of commander. (TNG: "Parallels")

Captain Beverly Picard
In an alternate 2370, Crusher was able to figure out that the temporal anomaly's effects were causing the crew's cellular structure to revert to earlier stages of development. At the same time, she became concerned about Picard's well-being after he learned he would be diagnosed with Irumodic Syndrome some time in the future. This caused her to reconsider her relationship with Jean-Luc, and she reversed her earlier decision to remain just friends. These events were eradicated from the timeline following the collapse of the anomaly.

In an alternate future, Beverly had been promoted to captain and was commanding the medical ship USS Pasteur. She had also married Picard and then divorced him quite some years prior, but had kept the surname of Picard following the divorce. She was initially skeptical of her former captain's claims about a temporal anomaly, but devoted the Pasteur to searching for it as a favor to the man she still considered a good friend. The Pasteur was destroyed in a Klingon attack, but Picard later convinced Beverly and his other friends that the anomaly was a real danger, and they returned aboard the future USS Enterprise-D to collapse it. (TNG: "All Good Things...")

Holograms
Dr. Crusher in Barash's holoprogram
Beverly Crusher has been holographically duplicated on a number of occasions.

In 2366, on stardate 43807.4, Lieutenant jg Reginald Barclay created at least two holographic Dr. Crushers shortly after he joined the Enterprise-D crew. Beverly took on the role of a friendly noble woman in one of Barclay's holo-fantasies. Riker, La Forge and Troi found Barclay asleep with his head on Crusher's lap after they intruded on his program. (TNG: "Hollow Pursuits")
In 2367, Barash recreated the entire command crew of the Enterprise-D on Alpha Onias III to keep Commander Riker there. Dr. Crusher was one of the personnel that was created. In this fictional timeline she was still serving as CMO aboard the Enterprise-D and holding the rank of a commander. (TNG: "Future Imperfect")
In 2369, on stardate 46424.1, James Moriarty created a holographic Crusher as part of his plan to trick Captain Picard into releasing control of the Enterprise-D. (TNG: "Ship in a Bottle")
Miscellaneous information
Crusher's quarters on the Enterprise-D were on Deck 8, Room 2133. (TNG: "Sub Rosa") Her office was on Deck 12, Room 1629, adjacent to sickbay. (TNG: "Genesis") 

Beverly had a fear of heights. (TNG: "Chain of Command, Part I", "Attached")

Crusher's command authorization code in 2373 was "Crusher-2-2-Beta-Charlie". (Star Trek: First Contact)

When Tom Riker masqueraded as Will Riker aboard Deep Space 9 as part of a Maquis plot to steal the USS Defiant, he claimed Dr. Crusher had forced him on shore leave. (DS9: "Defiant")

Beverly also said that she loved cats when Commander Riker complained about feeding Data's cat Spot. (TNG: "Timescape")

Chronology
Appendices
Background information
Beverly Crusher was played by actress and choreographer Gates McFadden. The character first appeared in "Encounter at Farpoint". Her last episode until the third season was "The Neutral Zone". She was absent from "The Child" through "Shades of Gray", although she was seen in stock footage from "Symbiosis" and "Skin of Evil" during Riker's flashbacks in the latter episode. She returned for "Evolution" and remained as part of the cast through the rest of the series and the four Next Generation-based motion pictures. Her character was not seen in "The Wounded" and did not have any lines in "Redemption" or "Cost of Living". Only her holodeck doppelganger was seen in "Hollow Pursuits".

Initially, Beverly Crusher was to be the Enterprise's schoolteacher. However, that was soon to change, due to David Gerrold. "One day during lunch," he remembered, "I kept talking about Beverly Crusher [....] and in the middle of this I said, 'We don't have a ship's doctor yet, why don't we have Beverly Crusher be the ship's doctor?' I wish I'd recorded the conversation, because everybody said, 'Nah, that doesn’t work,' and then they started discussing it. Eddie Milkis said, 'You know, that saves us a character. If Beverly Crusher is the ship's doctor, then we don't have to create a ship's doctor.' Then Bob Justman said, 'No, that makes it harder for the captain to have this relationship with Beverly Crusher that we want to have. On the other hand, the fact that it's harder to have this relationship puts more tension… You know, Gene, that's not a bad idea.' And then Gene started discussing it. By lunch, Beverly Crusher was the ship's doctor." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, pp. 102-103)

Beverly Crusher was one of the least-defined characters when TNG was conceived in 1986. According to the Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (2nd ed., p. 15), she was merely referred to in relation to Wesley (at one point a female, called Leslie) and did not even receive her own page of background notes until the final edition of the writer's guide. The original casting call for her character was as follows:

"BEVERLY CRUSHER – Leslie's 35-year-old mother. She serves as the chief medical officer on the Enterprise. If it were not for her intelligence, personality, beauty, and the fact that she has a natural walk of a striptease queen, Capt. Picard might not have agreed to her request that Leslie observe bridge activities; therefore letting her daughter's intelligence carry events further."
Though Gates McFadden mostly liked playing comedic roles, portraying Crusher was enjoyable for her. "I felt the producers really wanted me to be a part of it," she remarked, "and it was nice to be wanted [....] I auditioned for the part thinking it was a very funny part because they gave me 'The Naked Now', and I thought she was going to be a hilarious character, and I ended up with the straightest and most serious character of all." (The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, p. 103)

Crusher is the only character of the core seven TNG ensemble not to have appeared on one of the subsequent Star Trek spin-offs. 

Furthermore, Crusher is one of the few TNG main characters to not be seen in the DS9 style of uniforms, along with Deanna Troi.

An invitation to Beverly's wedding that did not appear on-screen
Beverly G. Crusher, as seen on a viewscreen
Beverly was given the full name Beverly Cheryl Howard Crusher on StarTrek.com, in homage to Gates McFadden's real first name, Cheryl. [1] On an invitation to her wedding, not seen on-screen in a Picard family album from Star Trek Generations, her middle initial is mistakenly given as "S." In "Sins of the Father", her middle initial briefly appears as "G" in an LCARS display. A medical case in "The Loss" has her middle initial as "G", as well. Also, in her bio from "Conundrum", her rank was mistakenly listed as lieutenant commander when she was already a full commander.

When in costume as Crusher, Gates McFadden hid her own hair under a wig, which required over an hour of preparation time before each day of shooting. [2] McFadden's own hair was much finer and longer, but the producers felt that Crusher needed a more professional look, hence the decision to use wigs. (citation needed • edit)

Officially, the difficulties in developing Crusher's character led to her character's departure by the second season. Unlike Natasha Yar, however, the TNG writing staff reassigned Crusher to Starfleet Medical, leaving open the possibility for her return. The writing staff's dissatisfaction with the Pulaski character and fan pressure via a letter-writing campaign allowed this to happen during the third season. (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion (2nd ed., pp. 64 & 98-99)) Patrick Stewart also supported McFadden's return. (citation needed • edit)

Despite this, Gates McFadden often felt she had to lobby the writers and producers for extra screen time and dialogue, not only for her character but for Deanna Troi and other female characters. Writer and Producer Jeri Taylor had much to do with increasing the focus on Crusher's character towards the end of TNG's run, giving her the opportunity to command the Enterprise in "Descent, Part II", eventually leading to her own command in the anti-time future of "All Good Things...". (citation needed • edit) This development went largely ignored in the TNG films, except for during Star Trek: First Contact. With Riker absent and Data captured, Crusher acted as the Enterprise's de facto first officer during the Borg crisis.

Apocrypha
Novels set after Star Trek Nemesis establish that Beverly and Picard eventually did admit their love for one another, beginning a relationship, leading to marriage and ultimately Beverly becoming pregnant with the couple's first child, Rene. (Death in Winter, Greater than the Sum, Paths of Disharmony)

In the novels, the explanation for Beverly's parents' deaths is that when she was three (and-a-half) years old, they were killed when their research vessel was destroyed by an Ubarrak warship. From that time, she was raised by her grandmother, Felisa Howard. (Death in Winter)
