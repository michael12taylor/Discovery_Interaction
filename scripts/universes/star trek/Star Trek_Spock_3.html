<html><p>In an interview with TrekMovie.com's Anthony Pascale in July 2007, Leonard Nimoy explained that he felt Spock had been superfluous in the script of Star Trek Generations and that that was why he had chosen not to appear in the film. Nimoy initially proclaimed, "There was no Spock role in that script," then elaborated, "There were five or six lines attributed to Spock [...] but it had nothing to do with Spock. They were not Spock-like in any way. I said to Rick Berman, 'You could distribute these lines to any one of the other characters and it wouldn't make any difference.' And that is exactly what he did. There was no Spock function in the script." 

In a memo he wrote Manny Coto (on 20 August 2004), Mike Sussman suggested that both an elderly Spock and a young version of the character be featured in a story covering an episode or two from the fourth season of Star Trek: Enterprise, if Leonard Nimoy was interested in appearing. As Sussman proposed, the older depiction of Spock would have been portrayed, in a framing story, by Nimoy, while the young Spock would have been played by another actor (a technique inspired by the portrayal of Indiana Jones in a two-parter from The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles called "Mystery of the Blues", which features not only a young version of Jones, but also a middle-aged Jones, played by Harrison Ford). In the same memo, Sussman envisioned Spock in the 24th century, as a "distinguished and retired Ambassador," being visited by a young Vulcan/Human hybrid who sought advice for balancing the two halves of his own personality. The elderly Spock then began recounting an adventure that took place in the early 23rd century, in which he, as a Starfleet cadet, assisted a middle-aged T'Pol, learning, in the process, "some lesson which helped him choose his own path in life." Sussman went on to suggest that a lot of new details about Spock could be divulged in the story, possibly including that, in his young adulthood, he had been torn between life as a diplomat (like his father) and a Starfleet career. The memo continued by proposing that Spock's mission include the now-aged other senior officers from Enterprise NX-01, and be "a secret and possibly illegal TBD mission." However, this Spock story ultimately wasn't developed. 

Roberto Orci, a co-writer of the film Star Trek, wrote the Spock character as being essential to that film's narrative without considering a back-up story, had Leonard Nimoy turned down appearing in the film. He recalled Nimoy raised an eyebrow at the idea of the destruction of Vulcan.  Commented J.J. Abrams, "Leonard was a dream to work with. He was always incredibly encouraging and excited about what he was seeing. He had a couple of thoughts, but he loved everything related to his role [....] He was happy to see Spock look so damn good!" (Star Trek: Costumes: Five Decades of Fashion from the Final Frontier, p. 240) Abrams also stated, "It's a big deal for him to come back and play this part again. I don't think it's something he expected to do. Directing him as Spock for the first time was as surreal a moment as I've had. It was preposterous, but wonderful." (Empire, issue 234, p. 126)

After the making of the film Star Trek, Leonard Nimoy retired (again) from acting and publicly stated that he did not intend to return to the role of Spock again, as he felt that to do so would be unfair to Zachary Quinto. Nimoy even went as far as to say, "I definitely will not be in Star Trek 2," and, "I think I can be definitive about the fact that I will not be in it." (SFX, issue #200, p. 68) However, it was eventually confirmed that he would indeed be returning to the role of Spock for the sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness.   Regarding how J.J. Abrams invited him to make a cameo appearance in the film, Nimoy recalled, "He just said, 'Would you come in for a couple of days and do me a favor.'" Whereas Nimoy had declined to cameo in Star Trek Generations because he felt Spock's part in that movie had been too general, Nimoy was persuaded that Spock had such a specific role in Star Trek Into Darkness that he was willing to accept the part. Addressing why he had claimed not to be in the film, Nimoy, who was very pleased that the truth of his involvement was kept secret, initially said, "I was asked time and time again if I was in the movie, and I managed to avoid answering without lying." He laughed, but was then reminded that he had flat-out denied being in the film and replied, "Maybe I was confused. Of course, speaking, if you'll pardon me, logically, I wouldn't know if I was in the movie until I saw the movie."  His cameo marked Nimoy's final appearance as Spock and his final role overall prior to his death in February 2015.

In 2017, Star Trek: Discovery producer Akiva Goldsman said that Spock would not be seen on Discovery.  However, two years later, Spock did appear in Discovery's second season, played by Ethan Peck.

Other language voice actors
An excerpt from the German version of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country; Weicker, voicing Spock, saying, "Wenn ich ein Mensch wäre, wäre meine Antwort mit großer Wahrscheinlichkeit: Fahr zur Hölle!... Wenn ich ein Mensch wäre." English: If I were Human, I believe my response would be 'Go to Hell!'... If I were Human.
Herbert Weicker was a German stage and voice actor who is widely associated with Spock, since he voiced this character in all German translations of episodes and films with the exception of the first run of Star Trek: The Animated Series.

Reception
Spock became one of the most enduring symbols of Star Trek. Accounting for the character's popularity, Gene Roddenberry stated, "I think that everyone was so smitten with Mr. Spock because he stood for loyalty and reliability." (Cinefantastique, Vol. 27, No. 11/12, p. 47)

The popularity of Spock was one factor that motivated Leonard Nimoy into demanding a salary increase for the second season of TOS. "By this time, Leonard's popularity had convinced him of what he already knew: He had the most important role," Herb Solow observed. In a memo Gene Roddenberry sent Gene L. Coon (on 1 April 1967), Roddenberry mentioned Spock having generated "considerable mail volume and public adulation" during the first season. (Inside Star Trek: The Real Story, pp. 317 & 319) NBC likewise regarded Spock and Nimoy as the most popular part of the original Star Trek series, and believed that losing them would be very unflattering. The popularity of the character was thus influential in Leonard Nimoy's continuation in the part. (Inside Star Trek: The Real Story, p. 324)

Roberto Orci has cited Spock as his favorite character. 

Casting Leonard Nimoy as an elderly version of Spock in the film Star Trek gave irate fans pause, caused them to stand down, and even won them over. (Empire, issue 234, p. 126) However, William Shatner has been disapproving of how Spock is portrayed in that movie and its sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness, commenting, "I thought the two Spock appearances were gratuitous. J.J. [Abrams] wanted to pay homage to Spock I guess, but he didn't offer anything to the plot [....] I told Leonard, 'You know that you're old when you go back in time and you're still old.'" ("Empire Presents 50 Years of Star Trek" supplement, p. 15)

Observations
Spock is referred to as a lieutenant commander in "Court Martial", though the final draft and revised final draft of that episode's script instead referred to him as a full commander (in the equivalent line of dialogue). The Star Trek Chronology listed Spock as having been promoted from lieutenant commander to full commander following "Court Martial". This was apparently the result of mishearing a captain's log entry that Kirk makes in "The Menagerie, Part I", where Spock is still identified as a lieutenant commander. He is also referred to as a lieutenant commander in "Tomorrow is Yesterday" and was first referred to as a commander in "Amok Time", indicating the promotion occurred between those two episodes. Somewhat oddly, even when he was a lieutenant commander during the first season, he still wore a full commander's stripes.

The events of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country show Spock having full command of the Enterprise, the latter having Spock outrank Kirk as he was in command of the entire mission. However, the events of "The Cage" and Star Trek: The Motion Picture show Spock having a lower rank than First Officer.

Spock's heritage was explored in a book about Star Trek science; it was determined that a Vulcan/Human hybrid is biologically impossible, as Vulcan blood was copper-based, while Human blood is iron-based – copper and iron are chemically incompatible. (citation needed • edit)

Trivia
Spock was the inspiration for the Decepticon scientist, Shockwave, from the "Transformers" franchise. Comic book writer Bob Budiansky, who gave Shockwave his name and personality, described the character as "my attempt to take Spock from Star Trek and make him into a Decepticon." 

Apocrypha
Barbara Hambly's novel Ishmael gives Spock's unpronounceable full name as "S'chn T'gai Spock," with "S'chn T'gai" apparently being the family name as opposed to the personal name. The ebook Seasons of Light and Darkness also uses this name.

According to Diane Duane's novel Spock's World, Spock was a descendant of Surak.

Spock briefly reactivated his Starfleet commission, with the rank of admiral, during the Dominion War, according to Spectre, a novel on whose writing William Shatner collaborated with Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens.

In the novel Crossover, Spock and several unificationists were captured by the Romulan Empire. He was ultimately rescued by Montgomery Scott, Commander Riker, Data, and Geordi La Forge aboard the USS Yorktown that Scott stole from a Starfleet museum using the shuttle he was given by Picard to control the Yorktown's computer. After believing Scott dead for 75 years, Spock was momentarily startled to see him behind the transporter controls, but quickly regained his control. Scott promised to explain how he reached the 24th century later to Spock.

In the novel The Fire and the Rose, Spock began to lose his emotional control after hearing of the death of Captain Kirk, and eventually returns to Gol to take Kolinahr training again. Spock ultimately succeeded and became truly emotionless, a situation that neither Sarek nor Amanda agreed he should have tried to do. Amanda in particular, felt Spock had rejected his Humanity and therefore in some measure, her by extension. Spock's lack of emotion also ultimately alienated McCoy when he came to ask Spock to stand with him at his wedding to Tonia Barrows and Spock refused. Ultimately, after Amanda's death in a shuttle accident and Spock seeing Sarek grieve for Amanda (which surprised Spock as he mistakenly believed Sarek to have also been a student of Kolinahr), and when Spock realized that he can't grieve for Amanda and that he didn't even miss her, he sought McCoy out on Earth to help him engage in an ancient Vulcan ritual to reverse the Kolinahr, allowing Spock to feel emotions again. This accomplished, Spock rebuilt his relationship with McCoy, was able to grieve for his mother and Captain Kirk, and once again found the balance and peace between his Vulcan and Human halves, allowing him to have emotional control again without rejecting his emotions.

In the novel Provenance of Shadows, Spock, having been contacted by McCoy's wife Tonia Barrows, and told that McCoy was taking a turn for the worse, went to see McCoy because he had regretted that he didn't get to see either Kirk or his mother once more before their deaths, and he was not going to make that mistake this time. Spock did spend the day with McCoy and planned to return the next day, but as he left McCoy's house, Spock was left with the impression he would never see McCoy alive again. Spock's feelings are proved correct as McCoy does die peacefully in his chair on the porch that same evening before Spock can return, with Tonia by his side, reflecting on his life and the good work he's done and his family and friends.

In the novel Vulcan's Forge, Spock commanded the science ship Intrepid II in 2294, a year after Kirk was lost in the Nexus. Within the story, Uhura was Spock's first officer and McCoy his chief medical officer.

Other novels set after Star Trek VI established that Picard was at the wedding of Spock and Saavik met Sarek.

In the novel Yesterday's Son, Spock found out that he had a son with Zarabeth, whom she had named Zar.

In the game Star Trek: Armada, Ambassador Spock was sent aboard a Galaxy-class starship to mediate a treaty between the Klingon and Romulan empires on Romulus. The Borg intercepted this ship and assimilated him. The USS Enterprise-E traveled two days back to make sure he reached the peace conference. The plan succeeded, resulting in Romulan and Klingon ships being dispatched to assist the Federation in defending Earth.

Spock in Star Trek: Countdown
In the comic series Star Trek: Countdown, leading up to Star Trek, Spock was aided in his attempts to help convince the Vulcans to provide the Romulans with the red matter necessary to stop the impending supernova explosion by Jean-Luc Picard, who was now Federation Ambassador to Vulcan, as well as by a restored Data, who was now captain of the Enterprise-E. Also, the comic established that Geordi La Forge had designed the Jellyfish, which Spock used to drop the red matter into the supernova. Just after the Jellyfish and the Narada were pulled through the black hole and into the alternate reality, the black hole finished collapsing and the Enterprise arrived in the area finding no indication anywhere that Spock managed to escape. Presuming Spock to be dead, Picard said that he hoped his friend's soul did indeed live long and prosper.

In the novelization of Star Trek, after Kirk told Spock that Dr. McCoy, Sulu, Chekov, and Uhura – all but one of the group of officers who had once been willing to throw away their careers to save him – were all serving on the USS Enterprise (taking McCoy's presence for granted when following the confirmation of the other three), Spock suggested to Kirk that their meeting, and the way the crew was already coming together, was the work of the timeline attempting to "fix" itself. As for the one person not yet aboard the ship, he had been well aware that Scotty was stationed at the outpost, which he had visited on occasion for supplies – though it wasn't clear whether they had actually met – but he had a made a point of keeping his distance. This self-imposed isolation was the only reason that he happened to be at the right place with a torch as the hengrauggi wrapped its tongue around Kirk's leg, which struck him as yet more evidence to support his theory – Kirk's arrival made it clear that the three had converged there for a reason, since he could give Scott the basics of his own invention, and therefore return Kirk to the Enterprise, with a way to take his rightful place in command (seeing that the young officer was obviously unaware of Regulation 619, he admitted to having forgotten how insignificant such things had been to the Kirk he knew so well), and hopefully be able to minimize the damage to the timeline.

In the comic series Star Trek: Spock: Reflections, the events leading up to Countdown were detailed.

Leonard Nimoy and Zachary Quinto also lent their voices to Star Trek Online; Nimoy reprised his role as Spock and narrated key events to players, while Quinto voices a Mark VI Emergency Medical Holographic program who helps the player though the tutorial level.

The 2013 virtual collectible card battle game Star Trek: Rivals was using Nimoy's picture for card #103 "Ambassador Spock".

The Star Trek: Ongoing story arc Legacy of Spock focuses on his place in the alternate reality's new Vulcan settlement. Though initially blamed in part for the ultimate destruction of Vulcan, he is ultimately revered for his dedication to his people and receives a monument that is still standing 3,000 years later. Unlike the other monuments, which are massive, his is life-size, reportedly because he felt to make it any larger would not be "logical".

The Doctor offering Spock a jelly baby
In the third issue of the Doctor Who crossover comic Assimilation², Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and Scott investigate a Federation archaeological team on the planet Aprilia III on stardate 3368.5, which had lost contact with Starfleet. Upon landing in the shuttlecraft Galileo, they are greeted by project manager Jefferson Whitmore, who assures them that all is well and gives them a tour of the facility, but Kirk finds the staff suspiciously calm, which Spock agrees with as by Human standards, the research team seemed remarkably placid and unemotional. The team later return to the facility after dark where they meet the Fourth Doctor, assuming he's a member of the research team and he helps them break the electronic lock with his sonic screwdriver and then offers Spock a jelly baby. Together, they infiltrated the facility. There, they find the researchers standing catatonically, with small cybernetic devices in their ears. It is discovered they were under the control of the Doctor's enemies, the Cybermen. A battle ensues and Spock and Scotty use their phasers on two Cybermen, while Kirk and the Doctor handle the Cyber-Controller. The Doctor then uses gold dust to clog up the Controller's respiration, allowing Spock to fire his phaser and destroying it. After the Cybermen are defeated and the Doctor slips quietly away, Spock assures Kirk there are no signs of anymore Cybermen on the planet, but Kirk arranges for a permanent garrison of Starfleet Security personnel to protect the researchers just in case.

In Star Trek Cats, Spock is depicted as an Oriental Shorthair cat.

In the Star Trek: Picard novel The Last Best Hope, Spock left Romulus in the early 2380s, believing there was nothing more he could achieve in the face of the predicted Supernova, but not without taking as many survivors as his small ship can carry with him. He was later contacted by now-Admiral Jean-Luc Picard when his journey brought him to an unplanned rendezvous with the USS Verity.
