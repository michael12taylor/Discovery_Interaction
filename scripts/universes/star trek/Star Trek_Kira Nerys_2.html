There were edges to me that might hurt some people. So I understand when she doesn't come up in those cultural conversations, but what has always satisfied me and kept me feeling okay about it all, are the people that I've met in the 20 odd years since they show. The women who say, “This meant a lot.” From people in NASA to just every industry I can imagine, women saying, “You know what? I was different growing up, and your character, I would say, ‘What would Kira do?’ And it gave me the strong answer.” So just to feel that, there was just this thread of influence and strength that Kira gave other women was really enough for me".

Heather Jarman commented: "I love Kira. If I had to drill it down to one reason, I would have to say its Kira's faith. Though she is truly a child of her era who understands the concept of 'wormhole aliens' and whatnot, she has this powerful belief in forces that she can't readily quantify or explain. She's willing to admit that she's not the 'highest' force in the universe and that there are other forces greater than she is. Her humility inspires me. Her bravery, her ability to move past prejudice, was one of the highlights of the series for me. She embodies traits that I not only admire, but want to cultivate in myself". [5]

Una McCormack commented: "Kira is one of the most complex and best performed female characters in Trek". [6]

Ronald D. Moore has revealed that the first name of "Kara Thrace" from Battlestar Galactica was inspired by Kira. [7]

Trivia
Kira Nerys was the first and as of this writing, one of only three characters in Star Trek to meet their mirror universe counterpart face-to-face on screen, the others being Voq, though the latter was "Ash Tyler" at the time and Paul Stamets who met his mirror doppelgänger while they were both trapped in the mycelial network. Captain Jonathan Archer does appear in ENT: "In a Mirror, Darkly, Part II" with his mirror counterpart, but only as a figment of the mirror Archer's imagination. 

Apocrypha
In the Deep Space Nine relaunch series of novels, Kira was shunned from Bajoran religion after helping spread a secular interpretation of the Prophets. After many months the decision was reversed. Kira became a Starfleet captain after Bajor was admitted to the Federation. The same year, in the Worlds of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine storyline about the Dominion, she was brutally attacked by the Jem'Hadar elder Taran'atar, and at the end of the story, barely surviving.

In Warpath, the novel following Worlds of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Volume Three, Kira fell into a coma and had visions of the Ascendants, in which she was a general trying to gain access to the fortress of Idran. She also had a conversation with the Prophets and Benjamin Sisko in the temple. To save her life, Dr. Bashir gave her an artificial heart. When told of this development by Sisko, Kira was horrified until she realizes it worked perfectly. To comfort her, Sisko wryly asked if she expected a drum solo.

As of the novels Rough Beasts of Empire and Zero Sum Game, Captain Kira no longer commands Deep Space 9 and has been succeeded by Elias Vaughn and subsequently Ro Laren. She went on to become a Vedek – completing the training in three years, a year less than any previous candidate – and subsequently sacrificed herself to destroy an invading ship coming through the wormhole in the novel Raise the Dawn. Her last appearance was in a vision to Sisko – although it may have been a Prophet posing as Kira – to inform him that his destiny was complete and that he could remain with his family. The novel Sacraments of Fire establishes that Kira was in fact thrown back in time to 2377, where she plays an additional role in resolving the Ascendants crisis.

In Star Trek Online, set in 2409-2410, Kira is the incumbent Kai, having relinquished command of DS9 to Captain James Kurland of Starfleet. She appears in the "Victory is Life" expansion released in June 2018, voiced once more by Nana Visitor. Guided by a vision from the Prophets, Kira and Dr. Bashir accompany the player character to the Gamma Quadrant moon where Kai Opaka had been marooned more than forty years earlier (see "Battle Lines") with a cure provided by Odo and the Dominion that allows Opaka to leave the moon and return to Bajor. Kira steps down as Kai and returns to Starfleet as captain of the Defiant to combat the Hur'q threat.

Kira Nerys of the alternate reality
The alternate reality version of Kira Nerys appears in the Star Trek: Ongoing story arc The Q Gambit where she is co-leader of the Free Federation Resistance and meets Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy after Quark helped smuggled them off Bajor. She then shows them the Reckoning Tablet and explains the artifact's significance in Bajoran mythology. According to legend, it contains two spirits: A benevolent Prophet and a malicious Pah-wraith and if the former can be freed, its power might be enough to restore order to the galaxy before she briefly explains the history of the Dominion and their alliance with the Wraiths. When asked by Spock how she intends to free the Prophet, Kira reveals they are on-course to a hidden planet to complete the ritual and offers both McCoy and Spock a spot in the Resistance. While Kira makes plans take a shuttle to the hidden base of the Resistance and supply them, she asks Quark wrap up the tablet and bring it aboard, but Quark reveals he will not be helping them. Opening the cargo bay doors, he reveals the Dominion made him a better offer than the Resistance and have won his loyalty. Though Kira attempts to fight, Spock restrains her seeing the fight is already lost. The tablet is then seized and the three of them are taken prisoner and brought to Terok Nor to meet Dukat. After engaging in some false pleasantries, Dukat smashes the tablet freeing both the Prophet and the Pah-wraith trapped inside and merges with the Pah-wraith and claims that there is now only one power in the galaxy: Dukat. Considering her a worthy host, the Prophet leaps at Kira only for Dukat to strike her with his newfound power and killing her.
