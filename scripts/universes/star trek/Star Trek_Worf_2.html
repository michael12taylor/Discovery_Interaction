<html><p>Worf ran regular Mok'bara classes during his time on the Enterprise-D, of which Deanna Troi and Dr. Crusher became regular students. Worf ran several classes of varying difficulties, such as the beginning and advanced levels. (TNG: "Clues", "Birthright, Part I", "Birthright, Part II")

Worf's scent was described as earthy and peaty, with a touch of lilac (although the tone of this comment implied that it was more of a joke). (DS9: "Trials and Tribble-ations")

As a warrior
Worf was a proven expert with both the bat'leth and his favored weapon, the mek'leth. He won a bat'leth tournament on Forcas III just before his birthday in 2370. Worf also defeated and killed both Duras and later Gowron in honorable combat. Both men were at one time considered to be the most prominent warriors in the Empire; Worf's skills as a warrior ushered in two successive Klingon rulers – Gowron, in 2367, and Martok, in 2375. (Star Trek: First Contact; TNG: "Reunion"; DS9: "To the Death", "Tacking Into the Wind") While teaching his moves to his young son, Alexander, he described the bat'leth as an extension of one's body. (TNG: "Reunion", "Parallels")

Worf's weapon skills were not simply restricted to regimented form, and he was able to adapt to unexpected conditions. When one side of the bat'leth he was using was shattered in his last duel with Gowron, he quickly chose the tip sections of the sundered side and used them like knives. Although Gowron was able to slowly force his opponent back, Worf still successfully blocked all the strikes of Gowron's bat'leth with his knives and killed him shortly after. (DS9: "Tacking Into the Wind")

In 2366, the fugitive Roga Danar escaped the brig of the Enterprise-D to return to Lunar V. Worf led the security staff in an attempt to recapture Roga, who managed to evade phaser explosions, transporter locks, decompressions and force fields to reach the shuttlebay. Worf fought hand-to-hand with the fugitive but the Angosian's genetic enhancements proved too powerful for him. (TNG: "The Hunted")

Worf's unarmed combat skills progressed to the point that, while being held in a Dominion prison camp, he defeated twelve consecutive Jem'Hadar soldiers in honorable combat, and forced the thirteenth, an Honored Elder, to yield in deference to his courage, the Jem'Hadar recognizing that he could only kill Worf rather than defeat him as Worf refused to give in to his opponent. Martok promised that, when they returned to the Empire, he would seek out Keedera himself, so a song would be written about Worf's accomplishment. (DS9: "By Inferno's Light")

Worf was considered to be a warrior of great renown. Advocate Ch'Pok referred to Worf as "a famed Klingon warrior." (DS9: "Rules of Engagement") Tumek recognized Worf by his Starfleet uniform, alone. (DS9: "Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places") General Martok knew of him by name, when Worf introduced himself in Internment Camp 371. (DS9: "In Purgatory's Shadow") His prowess as a warrior was respected enough that Klingon Chancellor Gowron diverted his entire fleet to Deep Space 9 to offer Worf a post at his right hand during the invasion of Cardassia. (DS9: "The Way of the Warrior")

Ailments and injuries
Beverly Crusher operates on Worf in 2364
Worf tended to get sick to his stomach when he was in zero gravity. (Star Trek: First Contact)

During a diplomatic mission to convey delegates from the Beta Renner system to Parliament, Worf was temporarily possessed by an energy being, displaced from its natural environment by the passing of the Enterprise-D. The being passed on to Beverly Crusher and, eventually, to Captain Picard, before the incident was resolved. (TNG: "Lonely Among Us")

Worf getting killed in 2364
Later in 2364, after Q transported the Enterprise crew down to the surface of an unknown planetoid (which was possibly created by Q), Worf and his shipmates were attacked by a group of musket-wielding aliens wearing 18th century French army uniforms. Unarmed, Worf charged the aliens and defeated some of them but was eventually stabbed in the abdomen with a bayonet by one of the aliens and died moments later, only to be revived by Riker, who was temporarily in possession of Q powers. (TNG: "Hide and Q")

Two years later, the Enterprise picked up a Zalkonian in the final stages of an evolutionary change. Since he had suffered memory loss, the crew simply referred to him as John Doe. When Worf tried to stop him from stealing a shuttlecraft, John Doe emanated an energy bolt in self-defense. Unfortunately, that bolt proved to be fatal to Worf, who was then declared dead by the medical crew. However, John Doe's strange transformations allowed him to heal Worf's injury and restore his life. (TNG: "Transfigurations")

Worf never really liked doctors ("any doctors"); however, there was one doctor that earned Worf's respect more than any other. In 2365, Dr. Katherine Pulaski discovered Worf suffered from rop'ngor, normally a childhood disease, and protected his dignity by keeping his illness secret. In gratitude, Worf invited Pulaski to participate in a Klingon tea ceremony, where he beguiled her with Klingon love poetry. (TNG: "Up The Long Ladder"; DS9: "Doctor Bashir, I Presume")

Once, while checking cargo containers, a large one fell on Worf, injuring his back and leaving him paralyzed. Unwilling to continue living as a paralyzed Klingon, Worf asked Riker to perform the hegh'bat. However, Riker refused to aid such a ritual, quoting, "That right falls to the eldest son." Opposition from Riker, Troi, and Dr. Crusher, in addition to Alexander's lack of knowledge of Klingon culture, led Worf to change his mind. He permitted Dr. Toby Russell to perform a dangerous and experimental procedure to replace his spinal column. The surgery was a failure, and Worf was declared dead. Due to the redundancies of Klingon physiology, where every organ in the Klingon body had a backup organ that activated whenever damage occurred to the first, his internal backups were initiated and Worf woke up. It took time, but with the help of his son and Troi, Worf made a full recovery. (TNG: "Ethics")

Worf was apparently allergic to cats, as was evidenced in 2370, when – following Lieutenant Commander Data asking him to temporarily care for his cat, Spot – Worf sneezed loudly while carrying her out of Data's quarters. The incident startled Spot. (TNG: "Phantasms")

While the Enterprise was upgrading its sensor array, Worf, along with Riker, Kaminer, Edward Hagler, Sariel Rager, and La Forge, was abducted by mysterious solanogen-based lifeforms for strange experiments. Since they were abducted in their sleep, many began to experience afterimages of the aliens' tests. Worf experienced one such flashback when he went to get his hair cut by Mot. When he saw the scissors Mot would be using, it reminded him of the blade used to probe him. In order to discover the location of the aliens, Worf suggested planting a homing device on Riker, so that when his next abduction came, they could locate him and the aliens. (TNG: "Schisms")

Worf suffering from Barclay's Protomorphosis Syndrome
Later that year, when the Enterprise became affected by Barclay's Protomorphosis Syndrome, Worf was one of the first crew members to devolve. He de-evolved into a Klingon prehistoric venomous predator, and after he sprayed Beverly Crusher with venom, he went on a rampage and terrorized the entire ship, killed Ensign Dern, and tried to mate with Deanna Troi, who had devolved into an amphibian creature. (TNG: "Genesis")

While the rest of the Enterprise-E crew enjoyed the age-reversing qualities of exposure to metaphasic radiation on the planet of the Ba'ku, Worf suffered the indignity of an affliction normally suffered by Klingons half his age, a gorch. (Star Trek: Insurrection)

Family
K'Ehleyr
Worf and K'Ehleyr embrace
Worf dated K'Ehleyr, a Human-Klingon woman, while he attended Starfleet Academy, but the relationship at the time ended acrimoniously. In 2365, while K'Ehleyr served as a Klingon emissary, she had to board the Enterprise-D to deal with a Klingon sleeper ship from the 23rd century. The two briefly rekindled their relationship when a joint holodeck training exercise led to a Klingon mating ritual. Worf, at the time, insisted that they take the oath of marriage afterward, but K'Ehleyr refused, stating, "Don't give me any of that Klingon nonsense." K'Ehleyr paid no heed to Klingon tradition, as she felt that she had inherited the worst traits of her respective parents' races (her Human mother's sense of humor, and her Klingon father's temper). They parted afterward, resolving their feelings before her departure from the Enterprise-D. (TNG: "The Emissary")

Unbeknownst to Worf, however, the mating ritual led to K'Ehleyr becoming pregnant with their child. K'Ehleyr returned to the Enterprise-D in 2367 to participate in the succession of Chancellor K'mpec, and took the opportunity to introduce their son, Alexander, to Worf for the first time. In the intervening years, she found she needed Worf after all, and wanted to finish the mating ritual. This time, Worf backed off, unwilling to permit his intervening discommendation to discredit either K'Ehleyr or Alexander. Worf's refusal to detail the nature of his discommendation prompted K'Ehleyr to start her own investigation, an action that triggered the attention of Duras and her subsequent murder. Worf and Alexander found K'Ehleyr dying from multiple stab wounds. Her whisper confirmed the identity of her killer, and she brought Alexander's small hand to his father's as she died.

Worf performed the Klingon death ritual and consoled his son in Klingon fashion before he abandoned the symbols of Starfleet and Empire. With only his bat'leth, he boarded Duras' ship, the IKS Vorn, claiming the Right of Vengeance under Klingon law. After the first blows were exchanged, Duras reminded Worf the cost of victory – Duras' death meant Worf's family name may never be cleared. Worf's family name suddenly meant little against the memory of K'Ehleyr, and he answered, "Then that is how it shall be!" and left Duras' corpse on the deck (see also: Alexander). (TNG: "Reunion")

Alexander
Father and son in 2372
Worf was unaware of Alexander's existence for the first years of the boy's life, until K'Ehleyr introduced their child in 2367. Under the Empire's discommendation at the time, Worf hesitated to acknowledge his son and thus perpetuate dishonor into the next generation of the House of Mogh. As K'Ehleyr lay dying from the stabs of Duras, her last act was to bring the pair together. Worf raged the Klingon death ritual, terrifying his son, but he brought Alexander to his mother for the last time, telling him, "You have never seen death... then look – and always remember." After avenging K'Ehleyr's death, Worf confirmed to Alexander that indeed he was his father (see also: K'Ehleyr). (TNG: "Reunion")

K'Ehleyr held little regard for Klingon traditions, let alone indoctrination, conflicting with Worf's theories of Klingon child-raising. Despite trying to teach Alexander about the Klingon artifacts located in his quarters (including a bat'leth), Alexander seemed to show no interest. After K'Ehleyr's death, Alexander was sent to live with his grandparents, but the Rozhenkos found that raising a Klingon child was now more than they could handle, in advancing years. Helena returned the boy within a year to be with Worf. Lwaxana Troi's influence added to Worf's headaches, but father and son settled into a home life aboard the Enterprise-D. (TNG: "New Ground", "Cost of Living")

Worf and Alexander played sheriff and deputy pursuing a dangerous criminal in an Ancient West themed holodeck program. One of Data's experiments accidentally turned all the holodeck characters into manifestations of Data (which also had all his physical capabilities), and disabled the holodeck safety protocols. With Alexander kidnapped, Worf arranged for his return by agreeing to a duel with the villain in the town square. Worf managed to survive by manufacturing a makeshift force field. (TNG: "A Fistful of Datas")

When Alexander was approaching his first Age of Ascension, Worf was appalled to discover that Alexander did not want to become a warrior. An encounter with K'mtar (a future Alexander from an alternate timeline) forced Worf to let Alexander follow his destiny. (TNG: "Firstborn")

Once the Enterprise-D was destroyed, Alexander was sent back to his grandparents. While he was growing up, Alexander decided he wanted to join the Klingon Defense Forces after all, eventually ending up on the Rotarran, Martok's ship. When reporting for duty, he referred to himself as Alexander Rozhenko instead of the son of Worf. A confused Martok asked what this house of Rozhenko was, to which Worf replied that Alexander was his son. Martok and Worf became concerned when Alexander was not fraternizing well with his Klingon comrades. Worf interrupted a fight between Alexander and Ch'Targh, when Alexander was on the verge of losing. Alexander revealed that he hated feeling like the unwanted son that Worf would rather get rid of. Worf tried to explain that the Jem'Hadar would not go easy on him, and that if he didn't learn how to fight quickly, they would kill him. After Alexander mistook a battle simulation as the real thing, the crew accepted him as the ship's fool. However, in the real battle, he successfully sealed a leaking plasma impulse injector. After this victory, Martok and Worf deemed him worthy of joining the House of Martok. (DS9: "The Way of the Warrior", "Sons and Daughters")

When Alexander revealed that he was transferring to the IKS Ya'Vang, Jadzia Dax decided to push forward her wedding ceremony to before he left, so that he could serve as Worf's Tawi'Yan. With the date moved up, Alexander was allowed to participate in Worf's Kal'Hyah ceremony (a Klingon bachelor party), along with Sisko, Martok, Bashir, and O'Brien. Despite being a Klingon, Alexander struggled through the ceremony almost as much as Bashir and O'Brien. (DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited")

Jeremy Aster
In 2366, Worf performed the R'uustai ceremony with Jeremy Aster, admitting him into the House of Mogh, after Jeremy's mother was killed on an away mission which he led. (TNG: "The Bonding")

Jadzia Dax
Jadzia Dax was Worf's second mate, and the first woman he ceremonially took as his wife. The two became good friends because of Curzon's understanding and interest in Klingon culture. When they first met at Quark's Bar, he instantly recognized the station's science officer as the new host of Curzon, a name honored amongst Klingons, to which Jadzia responded (in Klingon) that she was more attractive than Curzon had been. Worf, however, was distracted by Drex attempting to stir up trouble in the bar. When Worf managed to stop Drex and take his dagger, Dax said in amazement, "He's good."

Jadzia gave Worf a copy of her calisthenics program, which Worf mistook for Curzon's program. At this, Jadzia challenged Worf to a bat'leth match, which Jadzia lost. (DS9: "The Way of the Warrior")

When Worf moved his quarters to the Defiant, Jadzia gave him her collection of Klingon operas, and suggested that he play them through the Defiant's communications systems. Worf accepted them as a thoughtful gift, especially after Nog re-tuned and remastered them. (DS9: "Bar Association", "In the Cards")

Worf became romantically involved with Jadzia Dax in early 2373. It started when Quark's former wife, Grilka, came aboard the station. When Worf developed an instant crush on Grilka, he couldn't fathom how she could have married a Ferengi. Jadzia's explanation of the full story merely exacerbated Worf's confusion. (DS9: "The House of Quark") In order to win her heart, Worf decided to perform deeds that were overtly Klingon, such as throwing Morn off his stool, demanding bloodwine, and insulting Grilka's bodyguard, Thopok. However, since Mogh's family honor had been disgraced, Grilka could not possibly mate with Worf.

Dejected, Worf chose to help Quark win Grilka's heart, with advice from Jadzia. By controlling Quark's movements using a remote control device, he helped Quark defeat Thopok and win the heart of Grilka. Then Jadzia jumped on Worf and the pair had their own mating ritual. As required by tradition, Worf demanded that Jadzia marry him, but Jadzia understood that Worf was not a traditional man, and they agreed to a more gradual exploration of their relationship. (DS9: "Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places")

The romance had a rocky start. In their first holiday together (on Risa), Worf grew immediately jealous of Arandis, the chief facilitator at the resort planet and Curzon's former lover. Even though Jadzia explained that she had moved on, long ago, Worf remained suspicious. However, after a heart-to-heart talk with him, Jadzia helped Worf get over his jealousy. (DS9: "Let He Who Is Without Sin...")

When Dax found out from Sisko that Worf was to accompany Elim Garak on a suicide mission to find Enabran Tain, she took back her Klingon operas, which motivated Worf to survive his mission to the Gamma Quadrant with an embrace. (DS9: "In Purgatory's Shadow")

Worf and Jadzia Dax's wedding
When war broke out between the Federation and Dominion in late 2373, Worf and Jadzia were separated when they were reassigned. Dax was given command of the Defiant, while Worf was assigned to a Klingon ship. Jadzia vowed that, when DS9 was retaken and they had returned to their former positions, she would decide to wed Worf. This spurred Worf on, through the early days of the Dominion war. While all of Starfleet was grim from the news that the Seventh Fleet had been defeated at the Tyra system, Worf could only think of one thing: the fact that the ritual targ sacrifice was to take place after the wedding ceremony, whereas tradition dictated that it take place before. He had been bugging Martok about it, ever since they left Deep Space 9. He was, however, concerned for Dax's safety after her symbiont was injured, when she bore the brunt of an explosion near an M-class planet in a dark matter nebula. When she was rescued by the Rotarran, Worf was relieved to see that she recovered from the injuries. (DS9: "Call to Arms", "A Time to Stand", "Rocks and Shoals", "Sons and Daughters")

Following the successful Operation Return in early 2374, Dax decided to marry Worf within the week. All she had to do was appease Lady Sirella, mistress of the House of Martok, for the two to wed. This proved more difficult than expected, since Sirella, not wanting aliens to pollute her house, opposed the marriage. When Dax refused to stop a party, an enraged Sirella screamed that there would be no Klingon wedding. When Dax asked for a Bajoran-style wedding led by Sisko, a quivering Worf decided to call the whole thing off. After some fence-mending by Sisko, Dax, and Worf eventually resumed the wedding, and the pair married in Quark's Bar. (DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited") Later on, after Jadzia lost a game of tongo to Quark, Worf – who had also lost a bet on that game to Miles O'Brien – told Jadzia that he would rather lose a bet on her than win one on someone else. Jadzia felt that was one of the most romantic things Worf had ever said to her. (DS9: "Change of Heart")

The marriage proved strong. When Lasaran, a Cardassian defector, contacted Starfleet Intelligence in 2374, Worf and Jadzia were ordered to rendezvous with him and return him safely to Federation space. During the mission, Jadzia was seriously wounded by a Jem'Hadar energy weapon. The anticoagulant properties of the weapon put Jadzia's life in danger and Worf abandoned Lasaran in order to save her. The action caused Worf to receive a reprimand, and Captain Sisko believed it would prevent him from ever receiving his own command, but Worf stated he had no regrets. (DS9: "Change of Heart")

Worf mourns Jadzia
By late 2374, Jadzia and Worf had decided to attempt parenthood, despite the extreme difficulties posed by the disparate biologies of Trill and Klingons. Worf had already proven his ability in fatherhood by babysitting the O'Briens' son, Kirayoshi, and with the help of Bashir, Jadzia and Worf could attempt to conceive. In thanks, she visited the Bajoran temple on the Promenade, where she was attacked and killed by Gul Dukat, who was possessed by a Pah-wraith and was attempting to destroy the Orb kept in the temple. (DS9: "Time's Orphan", "Tears of the Prophets")

In 2375, Worf led a mission to destroy a Dominion shipyard. He dedicated this mission to his late wife, in order to ease her entrance into Sto-vo-kor. (DS9: "Shadows and Symbols")

Kurn
The sons of Mogh: Kurn and Worf
In the Enterprise's second Officer Exchange Program, Worf was reunited with his brother Kurn, whom he had not seen since he first left his homeworld as a child. Kurn used the exchange program as pretense to reunite with Worf, and to inform Worf that his honor was put into question because the Klingon Empire announced that their father had betrayed the Klingons at the Khitomer colony by giving the Romulans strategic information. When Worf challenged this ruling, Kurn was also present. When Worf decided to accept the dishonor (to prevent civil war), it was also decided to keep Kurn's bloodline secret to protect his honor. (TNG: "Sins of the Father")

When Gowron ascended to Chancellor after the Klingon Civil War and restored the honor of the House of Mogh, Kurn gained a seat in the High Council. For a time, it seemed that the House of Mogh would thrive and could even one day inherit the Chancellorship, but then Worf condemned the Klingon invasion of Cardassia.

An enraged Gowron had the House of Mogh stripped of its honor and had Kurn thrown off the High Council and continued on the course for war without Worf's help. (DS9: "The Way of the Warrior")

Four months after Kurn lost his seat on the Klingon High Council, he arrived at DS9 seeking help from his brother to perform the Mauk-to'Vor ritual. He felt that the ritual, which involved Worf killing him, was the only way to restore his honor. After receiving orders from Sisko not to carry out the honor killing, Worf arranged for his brother to have cosmetic surgery and his memory wiped so he could start a new life with no ties to the House of Mogh. (DS9: "Sons of Mogh")

Nikolai Rozhenko
Nikolai Rozhenko
Worf had a contentious relationship with his elder foster-brother, Nikolai. Cavalier, inspired, and rebellious, Nikolai's antics – and the pains he caused in their mother – invoked the ire of his dutiful, honor-conscious brother. Nikolai thought of Worf as a perfectionist, and resented him never being wild or disobedient. But the sibling tensions between the two seemed to be of a commonplace, Human variety. Later in life, reflecting on their childhood together, neither man made note of their genetic differences as a source of their friction. When asked if he and Nikolai were close, Worf considered, and merely said, "We are... brothers," Nikolai later automatically introducing Worf as his brother to a group of Boraalans when he could have just as easily introduced Worf to them as a friend. Reflecting on his brother, Worf also noted that Nikolai had many fine qualities despite their disagreements, acknowledging that his brother was "brilliant, persuasive... a natural leader," despite his inability to follow the rules. (TNG: "Homeward")

When making contact with Nikolai at the Boraalan homeworld, Worf (disguised as a Boraalan) was shocked to discover his foster brother had violated the Prime Directive. Worf, who was a firm believer in the Prime Directive, (TNG: "Pen Pals") discovered that Nikolai had become much more involved with the Boraalans than necessary. Nikolai conceived a child with a Boraalan female, Dobara, and became very protective of the Boraalans in her village. Although his actions saved the Boraalan race (whose homeworld had been rendered uninhabitable by atmospheric dissipation), it took the holodecks of the Enterprise and vast amounts of power to keep them from finding out. While the Enterprise shipped the villagers to their new home on Vacca VI, Worf and Nikolai navigated them through an ever-changing holographic landscape (subtly altered, so it ended up resembling their new home). As the power started running out, the holodeck was beginning to have trouble maintaining cohesion, and parts of the holodeck started manifesting itself. Worf calmed the villagers, claiming the images to be the sign of La Forge. They reached the new home just as the holographic simulations ran out of power and ended. On parting, Worf informed Nikolai that he would tell their mother that Nikolai was happy. (TNG: "Homeward")

Martok
Worf and the real Martok meet for the first time
Worf always had high respect for Martok, even when he was replaced by a Changeling. In 2373, Worf found the real General Martok in Dominion Internment Camp 371. Martok was forced to face the Jem'Hadar in daily fighting contests (one of which led to the loss of one of his eyes), until Worf replaced him. The way Worf won each battle so impressed Martok that he felt his actions were worthy of song. Having been healed by Bashir, and trained by Martok, who was at ringside for each of his contests, Worf defeated all the Jem'Hadar guards, so the Jem'Hadar First, Ikat'ika, presented himself as Worf's next challenge. Worf, already badly injured by previous fights, was losing and was about to let Ikat'ika kill him, when he experienced a moment of tova'dok with Martok. Worf stood back up one more time, refusing to yield to Ikat'ika. It was then that Ikat'ika realized that he could not defeat his opponent, only kill him, something which "no longer held his interest." Ikat'ika himself yielded the match. Deyos, the leading Vorta officer of the facility, had Ikat'ika executed for refusing to kill Worf. It was at that moment that Garak had finished the transmitter and all the prisoners escaped back to Deep Space 9.

With approval from Worf, Sisko, and Gowron, Martok was honored by being made commander of the detachment of Klingon soldiers assigned to the station. (DS9: "In Purgatory's Shadow", "By Inferno's Light")

Later, Worf convinced Sisko to release Martok after he threw K'retok off the Promenade, claiming it was a disciplinary measure, and that K'retok was not injured. (DS9: "Ferengi Love Songs")

Worf and Martok: Brothers of a Great House
Martok was given command of the IKS Rotarran and requested Worf to be first officer, with Jadzia Dax as the science officer. His first mission was to locate the missing cruiser IKS B'Moth. A string of defeats against the Jem'Hadar had sapped the morale of the Rotarran's crew, to the point where dishonorable conduct and dereliction of duty were commonplace. When Martok refused to engage the Jem'Hadar, the crew of the Rotarran decided to mutiny, and Worf challenged Martok himself, accusing him of being a coward. Although it was obvious, from the start, that Martok was no match for Worf, Martok's confidence and tenacity intensified during the fight. Realizing this, Worf subtly let his guard down and allowed Martok to win the fight, severely injuring Worf and retaining command of the Rotarran while restoring the crew's loyalty. This lead to the Rotarran's first victory over the Jem'Hadar, and the rescue of the B'Moth. Rather than punish Worf for mutiny, Martok thanked him for reminding him of his duty as a soldier of the Empire, and offered Worf a place in his House as a "brother". Together, the "brothers" turned a low-morale vessel that was on the brink of mutiny into the Klingon Empire's most distinguished ship. (DS9: "Soldiers of the Empire")

Worf, Alexander Rozhenko, Jadzia (and after her death, Ezri Dax) were all adopted into the House of Martok. Driven to the brink of madness by Worf's single-mindedness and longing for Dax, Martok could not be more pleased that the wedding to Jadzia was going ahead. He participated in Worf's Kal'Hyah ceremony (one of the few participants who had an easy time), and when Worf got cold feet, he convinced Worf to put the wedding back on track. After Jadzia died, Worf became concerned that her death had not been sufficiently honorable for her to enter Sto-vo-kor, needing to win a glorious battle in her name for her to do so. After Chief O'Brien got the truth out of Worf over bloodwine, he passed this on to General Martok, who gave Worf such a mission – destroy the Dominion shipyards of Monac IV. (DS9: "You Are Cordially Invited", "Image in the Sand", "Shadows and Symbols")

In late 2375, Worf was instrumental in bringing Martok to power as chancellor when he challenged the authority of then-chancellor Gowron. Upon killing Gowron in battle, Worf ceded his new position as chancellor to Martok. (DS9: "Soldiers of the Empire", "Sons and Daughters", "Tacking Into the Wind")

Worf was still a member of Martok's house in 2379. (Star Trek Nemesis)

Friendships
The crew of the Enterprise
In the holographic message Natasha Yar composed before her death, she noted her commonality with Worf, as orphaned warriors, and called him a kindred spirit. When Worf assumed Yar's duties after her death, he promised to uphold her example. Worf also seems protective of Tasha. As seen when he defended her from a female Klingon that Q summoned. (TNG: "Skin of Evil")

What friends are for
Though Worf was beginning to feel the Enterprise-D was becoming a true home, there came a point in 2365 when the isolation from his native society could not be ignored. Wesley Crusher's brush with a cranky Klingon inspired him to investigate, and discovered the cause of Worf's discontent. In a holodeck re-creation of a Klingon Rite of Ascension chamber, his loyal friends gathered to celebrate the tenth anniversary of his Age of Ascension and witnessed Worf endure the traditional gauntlet of painstiks. They had never seen him happier. (TNG: "The Icarus Factor")

Worf became a fixture at the senior officer's weekly poker games, where he liked to give the impression he took the game as seriously as combat. The "Iceman", as Riker sometimes called him, relished exorbitant bets and insisted that Klingons never bluffed (an assertion later proven false). In one game, he was prepared to wager his goatee against Beverly Crusher's hair color. (TNG: "The Emissary", "The Quality of Life")

Guinan once asked Worf why he always sat alone. Worf looked at her with vague irritation and replied that he required a Klingon woman for companionship, since "Earth females are too fragile." Despite Guinan's claim she knew one or two women on board who might find him a bit tame, an amused Worf refuted this as "impossible". (TNG: "Yesterday's Enterprise")

Arctus Baran's capture of Picard and Riker left Data in temporary command of the Enterprise-D for a period in 2370. Worf's evident dissatisfaction with Data's command decisions quickly grew into open criticism – improper conduct from an acting first officer. Data was forced to privately chastise Worf for his behavior, and quickly added his regrets if the confrontation ended their friendship. Chagrined, Worf acknowledged his errors and admitted that, if their friendship had been threatened, it was his blame alone. (TNG: "Gambit, Part II")

He took the disgraced Ensign Sito under his wing, helped her regain an exemplary service record (after her involvement with the Nova Squadron crash, two years previous), and got her recruited for a dangerous mission to Cardassia Prime, a mission she never returned from. Upon hearing this, Worf joined her friends for a drink at Ten Forward. (TNG: "The First Duty", "Lower Decks")

Jean-Luc Picard
Worf and Picard aboard the Enterprise-E in 2373
In the 2366 incident of Galorndon Core, the Enterprise rescued a fatally injured Romulan soldier named Patahk. Dr. Crusher discovered that he had cell damage to several vital areas that required a transfusion of compatible ribosomes and only Worf could provide the cells. Due to memories of the Khitomer incident and his distrust in Romulans, Worf refused to donate his blood. Patahk mutually agreed with Worf's decision, saying he would rather die than have his "cells polluted with Klingon filth". Picard tried to make Worf reconsider, asking (and soon begging) him for a favor as a friend, not as his commanding officer. Since it was not an order, Worf stuck with his decision not to donate blood and Picard respected his choice. Patahk died soon afterward. (TNG: "The Enemy")

When Picard was taken prisoner and replaced by a duplicate, the crew discovered the impostor from his differing behavior. Worf was one of the officers who mutinied against the impostor to side with Riker. When the real Picard returned to the Enterprise, he only needed one glance to Worf for him to initiate a series of events that culminated in Worf trapping the aliens. (TNG: "Allegiance")

When the honor of Mogh was called into question over the Khitomer incident, and Kurn could not serve as cha'DIch, Worf chose Picard to act as his cha'DIch. Picard accepted, and successfully uncovered the truth about the Khitomer massacre. The truth led to Worf and Picard's contempt for the House of Duras, who were the real traitors. (TNG: "Sins of the Father")

Picard's successful tenure as Arbiter of Succession to the Klingon Empire gave Worf added respect for Picard. Despite Worf having killed Duras, going against the Federation charter and Prime Directive, Picard forgave Worf for the incident, although he issued his security chief a reprimand. (TNG: "Reunion")

When the Enterprise-E was taken over by the Borg and Picard opposed the recommendation to abandon ship, Worf was labeled a coward by Picard, saying "You want to blow up the ship – and run away – you COWARD!" To this, Worf responded, "If you were any other man, I would kill you where you stand!" implying great admiration. Picard later admitted that Worf was the "bravest man" he had ever known and they both shook hands in camaraderie. (Star Trek: First Contact)

Guinan
Guinan and Worf compete on the phaser range
Worf met Guinan when she first came aboard the Enterprise. Guinan introduced Worf to what became his favorite drink, prune juice. As Guinan sat down at his table, she asked why Worf always sat alone. Worf looked at her with vague irritation as the conversation was venturing into areas he'd rather avoid. Worf replied he required a Klingon woman for companionship, as Human females were too fragile. Despite Guinan's claim she knew one or two women on board who may have found him a bit tame, a very amused Worf refuted this as "impossible." (TNG: "Yesterday's Enterprise")

When Worf's parents visited the Enterprise, Guinan consoled their fears about making Worf uncomfortable with their presence by telling them that, when people came to Ten Forward to look for their home star, Worf always looked for Earth rather than Qo'noS, reflecting their powerful role in his life. (TNG: "Family")

Guinan and Worf competed with each other in the phaser range. During the 2367 Klingon civil war, Guinan asked Worf about how his son, Alexander, was doing. Worf replied he was having difficulties adjusting to life on Earth, to which Guinan responded the time would come when Alexander found out what it really meant to be Klingon, just as the time had now come for Worf. (TNG: "Redemption")

William Riker
William Riker, a jovial and amiable man in general, got along well with Worf. In some instances, he managed to bring out eruptions of emotion that his stoic lieutenant strove to keep in reserve. When Riker was heady with the powers of the Q, he eagerly tried to share the experience with otherwise impossible gifts for his friends. He noted Worf's isolation from his native culture, and with the best of intentions, he gave Worf an aggressively lustful Klingon female. Enraged and embarrassed, Worf refused the woman, admitting that the world she represented was alien to him and he had no place for such a "gift" in his life at the time. (TNG: "Hide and Q")

As a vital, athletic man who participated in dangerous sports like parrises squares and anbo-jytsu, Riker might have liked to think he could keep up with a younger Klingon, and joined Worf in his brutally violent Klingon calisthenics holodeck program. The exercise ended with all opponents defeated, and Worf was looking for more, rather intently, and in the specific direction of his increasingly alarmed partner. Riker hastily called an end to the session. (TNG: "Where Silence Has Lease") 

Worf considered Riker a fellow warrior, and on at least a few occasions Riker asked Worf to accompany him on particularly dangerous assignments or potential transfers. (TNG: "The Outcast", "The Icarus Factor")

Sometime after those events – where Worf had risked offending (or worse) his superior officer with a sense of impunity – a minor gesture by Worf innocently reached out to reciprocate the proffered friendship. When Riker proudly prepared 'Owon egg omelettes for a meal with his gathered friends, only Worf could stomach the dish, eating with obvious pleasure and declaring the eggs "delicious". (TNG: "Time Squared")

Riker's practical experience with other Klingons, begun in the Officer Exchange Program, engendered an understanding of the Klingon culture that the other Enterprise-D officers, save perhaps Picard, lacked. Worf helped bring this about, by briefing Riker with his own knowledge of the rules of the chain-of-command in the Klingon Defense Force. When the time came for them to participate in battle exercises in preparation for the Borg threat, Riker was given command of the USS Hathaway to serve as the Enterprise-D's opponent. As Riker's first officer, Worf brought "Klingon guile" to bear (as the barely spaceworthy Hathaway had little else to offer), giving the Enterprise-D a worthy challenge and even coming to her aid against the Ferengi marauder Kreechta. (TNG: "A Matter Of Honor", "Peak Performance")

When Riker developed a complicated relationship with Soren, a member of the genderless J'naii, Worf overcame his discomfort with the J'naii to offer his aid to Riker in rescuing Soren when she was sentenced to receive "treatment" for her decision to regard herself as female, his loyalty and respect for his commanding officer overriding his issues with Soren and her people. (TNG: "The Outcast")

Their friendship was jeopardized for a time, after Worf began a romantic relationship with Deanna Troi in 2370. Riker's long history with Troi remained evidently unresolved, a fact that Worf was keenly aware of, and Troi refused to discuss. Picard's experience in an alternate future revealed how the existing tension could grow into naked animosity between the rivals for Troi. By that timeline, they had long been estranged and had no desire to mend fences with each other. During a skirmish with the Klingons, they openly blamed each other for putting the rest of their still-mutual friends in danger. By sharing that foresight with his officers, Picard gave Worf and Riker the chance to halt their schism before it could fully form, and they continued to be close friends. (TNG: "All Good Things...")

In 2371, the senior officers gathered in the Enterprise-D holodeck for an age-of-sail themed celebration, marking Worf's promotion to lieutenant commander. As was customary for Enterprise officers on such occasions, Worf was made to "walk the plank" over open water, and forced to leap upward to grab the dangling symbol of his new rank. Worf was the only officer in the ship's history to succeed in maintaining his balance, and dignity, by keeping his footing on the precipice. Unsatisfied with the precedent, Commander Riker ordered the holodeck computer to instantly remove the plank, using the holodeck's ability to disintegrate holographic matter. His order was mildly chastised (though not without amusement) by Picard, who indicated that the correct expression was to retract the plank. Riker shouted an apology to Worf, who was splashing and cursing angrily in the water. (Star Trek Generations)

Data
Worf and Data's excellent professional relationship and solid, if subtle, friendship was aided by the fact that they had two important things in common. First, both were rescued by the Federation after their homes were destroyed by enemy attacks, instilling in each of them a high regard for the Federation's ideals. Second, both were Starfleet pioneers; Data and Worf were, respectively, the first android and Klingon Starfleet officers. Although most of their time together was in the line of duty (such as bridge duty and away missions), both were frequent participants in the senior staff's poker games, and they often spent time together off-duty in Ten Forward. Also, Worf was one of the only people that Spot, Data's cat, warmed up to, despite Worf's disdain for the animal.

When Data's shuttlecraft exploded while returning to the Enterprise-D in 2366, all Worf could do was stare in shock at the viewscreen and mutter his friend's name. As it turned out, the explosion was staged in order to kidnap Data, and he was subsequently rescued. (TNG: "The Most Toys")

In 2367, Data sought Worf's help in finding a wedding present for Miles and Keiko O'Brien. (TNG: "Data's Day")

When Geordi La Forge and Ensign Ro Laren were presumed dead in a transporter accident in 2368, Data volunteered to arrange the memorial service, but he was unsure about what kind of ceremony to have and asked Worf for advice. Worf told him that, for Klingons, an honorable death in the line of duty was a cause for celebration, not mourning. Data took his advice and arranged a very upbeat party, giving people the chance to share their pleasant memories of the "deceased". (TNG: "The Next Phase")

A year later, Data again sought Worf's guidance, this time in researching the "dreams" he was having. Worf, preoccupied with rumors that his father had survived the attack on Khitomer, gave Data some cryptic answers about the importance of fathers to a person, but Data seemed to understand what he was saying and went on his way. Data later returned this favor when Worf learned that the apparently-returned Kahless the Unforgettable was actually a clone of the legendary Klingon; Data's reflections about how, after learning of his android nature, he chose to consider himself a person who could progress and grow over time rather than a machine who would never be more than he was, convinced Worf to accept Kahless as the symbol that he could be for their people rather than define the clone by the circumstances of his origins. (TNG: "Birthright, Part I", "Rightful Heir")

Their friendship was severely tested in 2370 when Data, acting as commanding officer, admonished Worf for challenging his orders in front of the bridge crew. Afterward, Data apologized to Worf if the dressing-down had ended their friendship, but Worf took the high road, saying that if the friendship was in jeopardy, it was his fault alone. After that exchange, their working and personal relationship quickly returned to normal. (TNG: "Gambit, Part II")

Deanna Troi
Worf was distrustful and uneasy around telepaths, but ship's counselor Deanna Troi became a trusted exception. When he was severely injured in 2368, he asked her to care for Alexander if he died, reasoning that his own parents were too elderly to cope with the difficulties of raising Alexander and assuring Troi that he could think of no better parent for his son than her. By late 2370, Worf asked her to become a soh-chim to Alexander, a role she gladly accepted. (TNG: "Dark Page", "Ethics", "Parallels") 

Worf and Troi during their romance
After an encounter with alternate realities showed him a life with Troi as his wife, Worf's eyes were opened to a new possibility, and he began to pursue her. Though surprised, Troi welcomed the advances, and the two enjoyed a romantic relationship through 2370. Deanna wasn't thrilled by Worf's concern for Will Riker's interest in the matter, but the triangle's tension was eased on the advice of Captain Picard. (TNG: "Parallels", "Eye of the Beholder", "All Good Things...")

By the next year, the romance seemed to have dissolved amicably, and eventually, she and Riker resumed their relationship. Worf's only visible unease at their wedding in 2379 was the result of imbibing too much Romulan ale, and the prospect of appearing naked at their Betazed marriage ceremony. (Star Trek Generations; Star Trek: Insurrection; Star Trek Nemesis)

Deep Space 9 companions
By contrast, Worf found it quite difficult to adjust to life aboard Deep Space 9, right from the day he arrived. When Worf entered Quark's, Quark asked if he wanted bloodwine (since he was Klingon, and every Klingon Quark met ordered only bloodwine). When Worf asked for prune juice, Quark laughed in disbelief. Worf did not share his humor, so Quark was forced to bring him the prune juice. It was the first of many confrontations with Quark, and the Ferengi in general (whom Worf thought unworthy to serve in Starfleet). (DS9: "The Way of the Warrior", "Little Green Men") During his time on DS9, Worf maintained an immense distrust of Quark, always referring to him as "the Ferengi bartender".

When Worf discovered Quark was dealing with a smuggling operation, he was confounded as to why security officer Odo never arrested Quark. After a disappointing response, Worf decided to take matters into his own hands. When the next smuggled crystal arrived, Worf stepped forward and arrested Quark. It was then that Odo shapeshifted himself and revealed the entire operation as a setup. Odo was going to follow the smuggler and uncover the entire Tarkalean smuggling operation. However, thanks to Worf's interference, Odo had to settle for the middle man. (DS9: "Hippocratic Oath")

Events came to a head one day when Worf's quarters were robbed by a burglar. The response by Odo proved to be disappointing to Worf. This event happened to coincide with a union strike taking place in Quark's Bar. Dr. Julian Bashir and O'Brien were betting who would enter Quark's Bar despite the strike. Both unanimously agreed that Worf would not enter the bar, recalling he rarely entered the bar even before the strike. When they saw that Worf actually entered the bar, O'Brien approached Worf to talk some sense into him. This proved a serious mistake, and led to the three of them being thrown into the brig. At this final incident, Worf decided that the only way to adjust to life aboard the station was to live outside it, on the Defiant. Eventually though, Worf managed to adjust to the activities of the station, even enjoying a Ferengi tooth sharpener in the process. (DS9: "Bar Association", "Little Green Men")

Benjamin Sisko
Worf with Captain Sisko in 2372
When Worf was posted to DS9 and transferred to the command division, Benjamin Sisko took him under his wing and began grooming him to one day be a captain. Their relationship was that of mentor and student.

Worf and Sisko became personal friends thanks to Sisko's experiences with Curzon and Jadzia, as well as being Worf's defense in his extradition proceedings against Ch'Pok and the Klingon Empire. Sisko also risked his own life to keep Worf alive. The Defiant crew had joined the Dominion in an attempt to destroy the Iconian gateway at Vandros IV. Worf was one of the officers who found tolerating the Jem'Hadar difficult. After a brawl erupted between Worf and Toman'torax (who was threatening O'Brien at the time), Omet'iklan decided to have both officers punished. For his disobedience, Toman'torax's punishment was execution by his commanding officer, Omet'iklan. Upon seeing that Sisko's punishment merely was to confine Worf to his quarters, Omet'iklan described the Federation as weak, and vowed to kill Sisko once the Iconian gateway was destroyed. Worf vowed that while the Jem'Hadar commander may succeed in carrying out his threat, he would not live to boast about it, which Sisko wryly found very comforting. (DS9: "Rules of Engagement", "To the Death")

When it was discovered that there was a Changeling in a high position in the Klingon Empire, Worf took part with Sisko in a daring mission to uncover the identity of the changeling and helped to train the Human officers to better appear as Klingon warriors. (DS9: "Apocalypse Rising") 

When Kira was praying for the Emissary during his visions of 2373, Worf surprisingly understood her faith in the Prophets (as opposed to the rest of the crew). He felt that the strength of Sisko's faith would be what pulled him through. (DS9: "Rapture")
