<html><p>In 2370, Dr. Beverly Crusher treated Reginald Barclay for a case of Urodelan flu and accidentally activated a dormant gene, mutating his T cells. The gene became airborne and began to affect the rest of the crew, causing them to "de-evolve" into more primitive forms of life. Riker devolved into an australopithecine and was found by Picard and Data attempting to break open Livingston's fish tank in the captain's ready room. He then tried to attack Picard and Data, but was stunned by a phaser and taken to sickbay. Data eventually discovered a way to reverse the effects, and the crew was returned to normal. (TNG: "Genesis")

The Enterprise-E
First contact
Riker aboard the Phoenix
Riker transferred to the new USS Enterprise-E in 2372, along with most of the senior staff of the Enterprise-D. In 2373 the Enterprise took part in the Battle of Sector 001 against Starfleet orders. Thanks to the ship's intervention, the Borg cube was destroyed, but not before it launched a sphere which generated a temporal vortex and traveled to the year 2063. The Enterprise pursued and destroyed the sphere before it could prevent the first flight of Zefram Cochrane aboard the Phoenix warp ship. The Phoenix was damaged during the attack, and several Enterprise-E crewmembers assisted Cochrane in repairs. Riker also needed to convince Cochrane of the importance of his first warp flight, as Cochrane considered canceling it following the Borg attack. Riker, along with Geordi La Forge, was present on board the Phoenix for Cochrane's historic flight. (Star Trek: First Contact)

Fighting the Son'a
Riker in 2375
In 2375 Riker, along with the Enterprise crew, defied Federation orders and rebelled against the plan to relocate the Ba'ku people from their homeworld in order to harvest the metaphasic radiation from their planet's ring system. While Picard and the rest of the senior staff protected the Ba'ku on the planet, Riker took the Enterprise out of the Briar Patch and alerted the Federation Council to the real issues surrounding the forced relocation. During the journey out of the Briar Patch, the Enterprise was engaged by two Son'a vessels. The ship was seriously damaged in the process and forced to eject its warp core to seal a subspace tear. Riker needed to invent a new tactic on the fly. Dubbed the "Riker maneuver" by chief engineer Geordi La Forge, it involved collecting metreon gas with the Bussard collectors and then venting the gas while the ship continued to move. The cloud left behind the ship reacted with the isolytic weapons of the Son'a ships, destroying one and crippling the other. Riker then returned with the Enterprise in time to disable Ru'afo's flagship and beam Picard off of the Son'a collector before it exploded. (Star Trek: Insurrection)

Battle with Shinzon
Commander Riker leads a team to combat a Reman boarding party
Will Riker's last mission aboard the Enterprise-E was during its encounter with Praetor Shinzon in 2379. Although Riker was eager to begin his life aboard the USS Titan with Counselor Troi, he realized how important it was to stop Shinzon and was willing to sacrifice anything in order to prevent him from using his thalaron radiation weapon on Earth.

The Scimitar fought and weakened the Enterprise in the Battle of the Bassen Rift, sending several boarding parties to the ship. Riker and Worf took a security detail to fight off the invading Remans. The Reman Viceroy entered the Jefferies tubes in an attempt to reach the bridge and kidnap Captain Picard. Riker followed and they fought hand-to-hand, with Riker eventually killing the Viceroy by knocking him down an Enterprise maintenance shaft. (Star Trek Nemesis)

Command offers
Riker was offered several commands during his tenure aboard the Enterprise. In addition to the aforementioned USS Drake, he was offered the USS Aries in 2365 and the USS Melbourne in 2366. (TNG: "The Icarus Factor", "The Best of Both Worlds") The Aries command was offered to Riker because of his exceptional abilities as an explorer and diplomat. He turned down the Aries posting because he felt he was not yet ready to leave the Enterprise and the distinction that the first officer post held. (TNG: "The Icarus Factor") Starfleet put a great amount of pressure on Riker to accept command of the Melbourne. Many admirals and even Captain Picard felt that he had remained too long on board the Enterprise and should have accepted a command by that point in his career, lest it seem like he was standing still in a sea of upstart officers like Shelby. Even Riker questioned why he remained as Enterprise first officer, and was unable to understand what kept him from leaving. (TNG: "The Best of Both Worlds")

Ultimately Riker did not need to make a choice, as he was field-promoted to captain during the encounter with the Borg and the Melbourne was subsequently destroyed at Wolf 359. Although it was believed Riker would have a pick of any command because his decisive leadership was a major factor in the defeat of the Borg, he still elected to remain Enterprise first officer. (TNG: "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II")

Captain William T. Riker prior to taking command of the USS Titan.
By 2379, Riker decided to accept promotion to captain of the USS Titan, assuming command of the ship that year. Troi also transferred to the Titan. (Star Trek Nemesis)

Commanding the USS Titan
First assignment
Following Riker's assuming command of the Titan, they were dispatched to the Romulan Neutral Zone to serve as the command ship for a diplomatic task force. (Star Trek Nemesis)

Saving the Cerritos
Captain Riker in command of the Titan
In 2380, Riker, along with the Titan's crew, saved the USS Cerritos when it was being attacked by three Pakled Clumpships. He later offered Ensign Bradward Boimler a promotion to Lieutenant junior grade and a position aboard the Titan based on the Cerritos' first officer Jack Ransom's recommendation, which Boimler accepted. (LD: "No Small Parts")

Investigating the Pakleds
Riker debriefing his bridge crew on his suspicions of the Pakled attacks

In 2381, the Titan was ordered to investigate the take over of a mining colony located on Karzill IV. (LD: "Kayshon, His Eyes Open") 
Reserved retirement
Life on Nepenthe
As of 2399, the retired Admiral Picard still considered Riker a loyal colleague who would not hesitate to join him on a mission if asked. By that time, Riker had left active service in Starfleet, though he remained in reserve as needed, and settled on the planet Nepenthe. His house there was protected by shields due to trouble with the Kzinti. He remained married to Deanna Troi and had two children, Thaddeus and Kestra. "Thad", as his family called him, died in childhood from mendaxic neurosclerosis, caused by a silicon-based virus that could have been cured with the aid of an active positronic matrix; by the time Thad was diagnosed, however, there were no active matrices to be found, and none could be made due to the ban on the technology following the attack on Mars in 2385. (PIC: "Maps and Legends", "Nepenthe")

Riker shares a moment with Picard
Picard soon arrived on Nepenthe later that year with Soji Asha, whom Riker immediately recognized as being an android descended from Data. As Picard had expected, Riker and Troi both offered to help him without hesitation, opening their home to him and Soji for as long as they needed. (PIC: "Nepenthe")

Return to duty
Shortly afterwards, Riker temporarily left retirement to command the USS Zheng He at the head of a fleet dedicated to helping the residents of Coppelius resist a Zhat Vash attack. There, he confronted General Oh, claiming Coppelius to be under Federation protection, but the Zhat Vash fleet withdrew before a fight could begin, due to Soji's deactivation of the beacon. Riker contacted a relieved Picard, explaining that he had returned to help after learning of Picard's SOS in order to help his old friend since he couldn't talk Picard out of his plan. The Zheng He then withdrew from Coppelius with the rest of the fleet to escort the Romulans from Federation space. (PIC: "Et in Arcadia Ego, Part 2")

Personal interests
Music
Riker plays the trombone
Riker was a jazz aficionado, and his favorite musical instrument was the trombone. Although he was an accomplished player, his skills were not quite up to that of a professional musician (TNG: "11001001") and he had trouble with certain pieces, including "Night Bird". (TNG: "Second Chances")

Riker could also play the piano and taught Amarie, a musician in a bar on Qualor II, some jazz routines when the Enterprise visited the planet in 2368. (TNG: "Unification II")

Data performed Irving Berlin's "Blue Skies" at Riker's wedding to Deanna Troi because of his knowledge of Riker's fondness for "archaic musical forms." (Star Trek Nemesis)

Poker
Riker first began playing poker as a junior officer aboard the Potemkin. (TNG: "Lower Decks") He became a notoriously good player aboard the Enterprise, participating in most of the ship's weekly poker games and even teaching master classes on the game. (TNG: "The Measure Of A Man", "The Price") He also knew several card tricks, one of which was used in a failed attempt to fool Data in 2367. (TNG: "Legacy") His poker skills were noted by Captain Picard, and their connection to diplomatic skills was one of the reasons he was selected to replace Mendoza as the Federation representative in the Barzan wormhole negotiations. (TNG: "The Price")

In an alternate timeline, Dr. Crusher noted that Riker raised his left eyebrow slightly while bluffing, although she later claimed to be kidding. (TNG: "Cause and Effect") In 2369, Riker, La Forge, and Worf made an unconventional wager with Dr. Crusher: if any of the men won the hand, she would become a brunette, and if Crusher won, the men would shave their beards. However, the senior staff were called to the bridge before the hand was over. (TNG: "The Quality of Life")

Riker was skilled in other forms of gambling and won large sums of latinum at the dabo tables in Quark's during an Enterprise visit to Deep Space 9. Quark claimed he was unable to pay Riker at the time, and later voided the winnings in exchange for information about the whereabouts of the Duras sisters Lursa and B'Etor. (TNG: "Firstborn") Riker met DS9 officer Jadzia Dax at Quark's about this time. (DS9: "Defiant")

Sports
Riker had several sports-related hobbies. Anbo-jyutsu was one such interest, (TNG: "The Icarus Factor") as were Parrises squares (TNG: "Future Imperfect", "Timescape") and handball. (ENT: "These Are the Voyages...") He had skills in the martial arts, tai chi chuan in particular (TNG: "Second Chances"), and took Worf's mok'bara classes. (TNG: "Clues") He also enjoyed fishing. One of his favorite fishing spots was Curtis Creek, which he recreated in a holoprogram. (TNG: "The Icarus Factor", "Second Chances", "Future Imperfect")

Other interests
Riker was quite skilled at three-dimensional chess, as he used the Queen's gambit coupled with the Aldabren Exchange to defeat the Ferengi Nibor during the closing reception of the biennial Trade Agreements Conference aboard the USS Enterprise-D. (TNG: "Ménage à Troi") Riker had an interest in cooking from when he had had to fend for himself as a child. (TNG: "Time Squared", "Remember Me") He was a member of Beverly Crusher's theater troupe aboard the Enterprise-D and played the lead in two plays, Something for Breakfast (TNG: "A Fistful of Datas") and Frame of Mind. (TNG: "Frame of Mind") His favorite vacation spot was Risa. (TNG: "Captain's Holiday", "The Game") Riker also enjoyed dabo, although the beckoning profits did not appear to be the motivating factor. At Quark's on Deep Space 9, Lt. Jadzia Dax staked Riker three strips of gold-pressed latinum when his winning-streak ran dry. He later contacted Quark and traded his unclaimed winnings for information on the Duras sisters. (TNG: "Firstborn"; DS9: "Defiant")

Personal relationships
Marriage
Wedding ceremony in Alaska
Will and Deanna were finally married in 2379, shortly before their transfer to the USS Titan. Their wedding party in Alaska included Captain Picard as best man, Dr. Crusher as bridesmaid, and Data, La Forge, Worf, and Wesley Crusher as groomsmen. Guinan was also present. Another ceremony, a traditional Betazoid wedding, was planned on Betazed shortly following. However, that ceremony was delayed when the Enterprise was diverted to Romulus. (Star Trek Nemesis)

Friendships
Because of his fair and decisive command style and his easy-going, affable personality, Riker was popular among the Enterprise-D crew and had friendships with senior staff members as well as junior officers. (TNG: "Data's Day") Some junior officers, such as Sam Lavelle, found him less easy to get along with. Riker was slightly annoyed with Lavelle, claiming he was too eager to please. Later, Counselor Troi suggested that his adversity actually stemmed from the fact that Lavelle was very much like Riker when he himself had been a junior officer. (TNG: "Lower Decks")

Riker flirts with Guinan
Riker had known Geordi La Forge longer than any of the crew, but they didn't become friends until they served on the Enterprise together. (TNG: "The Next Phase") He counseled La Forge following the loss of his mother in 2370, although La Forge did not heed his advice at the time. (TNG: "Interface")

While Dr. Beverly Crusher was head of Starfleet Medical in 2365, Riker was one of the Enterprise officers who made sure Wesley Crusher kept up with his studies and responsibilities aboard the ship. (TNG: "The Child") Riker and Guinan tried to advise Wesley on his relationship with Salia, but their assistance rapidly went off track from its original intention. (TNG: "The Dauphin")

Jean-Luc Picard
Riker and Captain Picard on the bridge of the late Enterprise-D
When choosing a first officer prior to the launch of the Enterprise in 2363, Captain Picard nearly passed over Riker's record. He stopped when he saw the incident with Captain DeSoto and Riker's refusal to allow the captain to beam down. This was a major factor in Picard's selection of Riker as his first officer. He was impressed that a first officer would challenge a captain's authority out of regard for the safety of the captain and the crew. (TNG: "The Pegasus") The trust Picard held in his first officer almost certainly saved the Federation. When the Enterprise encountered the Borg cube after the massacre at Wolf 359, Locutus of Borg, being reminded of that trust by Riker, would, though he knew perfectly well it was a lie, at least listen and respond to Riker's attempt to negotiate the circumstances of assimilation, distracting the Borg long enough to locate Locutus on the cube and effect a rescue, eventually using Picard's link to the Collective to destroy the ship in Earth orbit. (TNG: "The Best of Both Worlds", "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II")

Captain Picard was very cold towards Riker during their first meeting and ordered the manual docking as a test of Riker's abilities. When he performed the docking with great expertise and skill, Picard formally greeted Riker, requesting that his new first officer make sure that he not allow Picard to "make an ass of himself" in front of the many children aboard the ship. One year later, Picard felt as if he had not done a good job of congratulating Riker, so he did it once more, this time making his feelings clear. (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint", "The Icarus Factor")

Eventually, Riker and Picard became very good friends. With the best of intentions, Riker suggested that Picard vacation at Risa in 2366, asking him to return a horga'hn. Picard did not realize the history behind the statue and kept it with him after purchasing it for Riker, making it appear as if the captain was seeking jamaharon. (TNG: "Captain's Holiday")

The only time Riker and Picard ever verbally fought in front of the Enterprise crew was in 2366 while under the influence of emotions projected by Ambassador Sarek (whom Picard greatly respected), suffering from Bendii Syndrome. (TNG: "Sarek")

Picard tried to counsel Riker when he was offered command of the USS Melbourne in 2366, reminding him that the Enterprise would continue without his presence and that officers like Shelby were very much as he himself had been before he learned the lessons necessary for command of a starship. (TNG: "The Best of Both Worlds") Riker also came to Captain Picard for advice when Worf wanted his help with the hegh'bat and when he struggled with a decision involving Soren. (TNG: "Ethics", "The Outcast")

In early 2369, members of the Enterprise crew, including Picard, were turned into twelve-year-olds by the effects of a molecular reversion field. Unfortunately, a group of Ferengi commandeered the Enterprise about that time. Believing Picard to be a child, they confined him to a classroom aboard the ship while Riker was held in the observation lounge. Picard threw a tantrum and demanded to see his "father," Riker. They pretended to be father and son in order for Picard to plant a suggestive message to Riker, requesting access to the Enterprise main computer from the classroom. Picard, along with the other affected Enterprise crew members, was able to design a plan to retake the Enterprise from the Ferengi. (TNG: "Rascals")

During the Pegasus incident of 2370, Picard tried to investigate the circumstances surrounding the ship's disappearance. He ran into many dead-ends, as most records had been sealed, and had to use many favors in Starfleet Command to even get a look at the findings of the board convened to investigate the loss of the Pegasus. Riker would not divulge further information under the orders of Admiral Erik Pressman, and Picard reluctantly continued the search. He made it clear to Riker that he hoped he still considered the safety of the Enterprise his top priority, and said that if he found this to be untrue, he would re-evaluate his trust in Riker. After the crisis was resolved, Picard visited Riker in the brig and returned him to duty aboard the Enterprise, understanding Riker's mistake in the past and satisfied that he had made the correct decisions in the present. (TNG: "The Pegasus")

Picard served as Riker's best man during his wedding to Deanna Troi in 2379. He gave a toast to Riker, calling him his "trusted right arm" for the previous fifteen years and lamenting his loss of a fine first officer. (Star Trek Nemesis)

While aboard the Enterprise, Picard generally referred to Riker as "Number One", a nickname he used for his first officer. (TNG: "Disaster") Chillingly, Locutus of Borg also called Riker "Number One" while dealing with the Enterprise crew. (TNG: "The Best of Both Worlds", "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II")

Worf
Worf considered Riker one of his closest friends, despite their vastly different personalities. Riker was one of the only Humans who participated in Worf's brutally violent holodeck calisthenics program. (TNG: "Where Silence Has Lease") In 2365, Worf wanted to transfer to the USS Aries with Riker, concerned for his safety. (TNG: "The Icarus Factor") Riker also tried to convince Worf to donate his blood in order to save the Romulan Patahk, rescued from Galorndon Core in 2366. He tried to make Worf realize that this gesture of goodwill might be the first step toward healing the differences between their peoples. (TNG: "The Enemy")

Worf asked Riker to assist him in the hegh'bat, a Klingon ritual suicide, following his spinal cord injury in 2368. Riker was appalled by the request, feeling that Worf's life was still worth living and that suicide would be an insult to all of their comrades who had struggled for life up until their death. He researched the tradition before coming to Worf with his decision. He found that the hegh'bat was generally practiced with the oldest son, and then left it up to Worf to ask his young son Alexander Rozhenko to help. Worf was unable to ask Alexander to participate in the ritual, and later decided to attempt a risky surgery involving the genetronic replicator. (TNG: "Ethics")

Despite his discomfort with the androgynous nature of the J'naii, Worf helped Riker during his mission to rescue Soren, realizing how important Soren was to Riker. (TNG: "The Outcast")

Riker also liked to good-naturedly rib Worf, who was notorious for his lack of a sense of humor. This would be proven correct as Worf would only glare or growl in response to Riker's antics. During the Iyaaran visit in 2370, Riker jokingly chastised Worf for thinking the dress uniform was too feminine and weak-looking, later telling Worf he thought he looked good in a dress. (TNG: "Liaisons")

Riker encouraged Alexander's love of jazz music by giving him several recordings. Worf, however, was not a fan. (TNG: "Phantasms")

Riker wanted to give Worf a surprise party for his birthday in 2370, but Deanna Troi talked him out of it. (TNG: "Parallels")

Riker with Worf in 2371
In late 2370, Worf began dating Deanna Troi, which placed some strain on his relationship with Riker despite Worf's best efforts to prevent it. (TNG: "Eye of the Beholder", "All Good Things...") Worf tried to ask Riker for his permission to date Troi, but the attempt came off as comic rather than serious. (TNG: "Eye of the Beholder")

Data
Riker first met Data on the Enterprise holodeck in 2364. Data was trying to whistle "Pop Goes the Weasel," but could not finish the last few notes. Riker helped him finish, later giving Data the nickname "Pinocchio" in reference to Data's wish to become Human. Riker later recalled this incident fondly during Data's wake, although he was unable to remember the song Data was whistling. (Star Trek Nemesis) At first Riker was skeptical about Data's abilities as a machine, assuming that his rank of lieutenant commander was merely honorary, although Data had earned the rank as much as any other Starfleet officer of the same rank and above. (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint")

In 2365, Data's status as a sentient individual came into question. A trial was set on Starbase 173, but the base lacked a complete legal staff. As Enterprise first officer, Riker was forced to act as attorney for Bruce Maddox and was given the difficult task of convincing Judge Phillipa Louvois that as an android, Data was not sentient. He very nearly proved that Data was a simple machine by deactivating him, but Picard's defense later made Louvois grant Data complete rights as a sentient being. Riker was distressed over the incident and felt terrible that he nearly cost Data his rights. Data did not hold any ill will towards Riker, though, and was actually grateful that Riker participated, for if he had not, the ruling would have been a default in Maddox's favor. He assured Riker that he would not forget that the actions the commander found so upsetting had saved his life. (TNG: "The Measure Of A Man")

Riker with Data aboard the Cleponji in 2366
Riker was also well aware of the fondness the rest of the crew felt for Data. In 2366, after Data's apparent death in a shuttlecraft explosion (while ferrying hytritium, a compound too unstable for transporter use), upon seeing La Forge's furious refusal to accept that Data himself might have been responsible for the accident, Riker told Picard that, for someone incapable of feeling emotions, he was quite capable of bringing them out in others. Soon afterward he accidentally brought about Data's recovery, as it was Riker's suspicions – that since the hytritium, needed to purge tricyanate from the water on Beta Agni II, did so in seconds rather than hours, the water must have been poisoned – which launched an investigation of Kivas Fajo, who had provided the hytritium (in exactly the amount needed). Upon learning of Fajo's status as a collector, the crew, deducing that their friend's death had been faked, quickly tracked down Fajo's ship and returned Data to the Enterprise. (TNG: "The Most Toys")

Data sought Riker's help and advice on several occasions. One instance was when he asked for Riker's advice on friendship and betrayal following a mission involving Ishara Yar in 2367. (TNG: "Legacy") Data also asked for Riker's help when Keiko Ishikawa temporarily called off her wedding to Miles O'Brien in 2367. (TNG: "Data's Day") He also came to Riker for advice when he started to date Jenna D'Sora. (TNG: "In Theory")

Carol Freeman
William T. Riker and Carol Freeman.
Riker was one of Captain Carol Freeman's old friends, close enough for Riker to consider Freeman his cha'DIch and reminisce about the times they got into trouble together, although Freeman contended that Riker alone was responsible for starting incidents. Riker was also a mentor to Beckett Mariner, Freeman's daughter. He was also the source of many contrabands that Mariner collected. Seeing Riker was a source of Mariner's frequent insubordinate behavior, Freeman was slightly annoyed when they met again in 2380. (LD: "No Small Parts")

Beckett Mariner
William T. Riker and Beckett Mariner.
Riker was a mentor to Ensign Beckett Mariner and a source of Mariner's contrabands, such as Romulan ale. Riker owed Mariner a favor sometime prior to 2380, which he considered paid when his ship, the USS Titan, saved Mariner's ship, the USS Cerritos from being captured and destroyed by the Pakleds. (LD: "No Small Parts")

Family
Kyle Riker
Will saw his father Kyle Riker for the first time in fifteen years when he came aboard the Enterprise to brief him on the USS Aries command. The two remained adversarial, despite Kyle's wish to heal any wounds before Riker departed on his mission. Dr. Pulaski, an old flame of Kyle's, told Will about Kyle's bravery following the Tholian attack and suggested that the time had come to resolve their conflict. Will and Kyle decided to settle their differences with a match of anbo-jytsu, at which time Will discovered that Kyle had been cheating since Will was twelve. The activity allowed them to vent the tension and have an actual conversation about their true feelings, which they had never done. Kyle finally told Will that he loved him before returning to Starbase Montgomery. (TNG: "The Icarus Factor") After this incident, Will was finally able to put their past difficulties behind him. (TNG: "Second Chances")

Thomas Riker
Thomas and William
The Enterprise was sent to Nervala IV in late 2369, when the atmospheric disturbances began to subside. Riker led an away team to the surface, and discovered his duplicate, later known as Thomas Riker. The two quickly clashed over various issues, including Tom's resistance to direct orders and his attempts to rekindle a relationship with Deanna Troi. Tom felt that Will was the one who had benefited from his misery of being stuck on the planet for eight years. After working together to retrieve log files from the station computers and saving one another's lives, they began to accept one another. Thomas transferred to the USS Gandhi, and Will gave him their trombone as a parting gift. (TNG: "Second Chances")

By 2371, Tom had resigned his post to join the Maquis. He pretended to be Will Riker in order to gain access to the USS Defiant, which he then stole for use by the Maquis. (DS9: "Defiant")

Romance
Beata
Riker spent the night with Mistress Beata during his mission to Angel I in 2364, presenting her with an Albeni meditation crystal. She was fascinated by his strength and power, traits which were not abundant in the males of her world. Riker donned the traditional clothing of the planet, drawing snickers from Counselor Troi and Lieutenant Natasha Yar. (TNG: "Angel One")

Minuet
The Bynars created a holographic woman named Minuet to distract Riker while they hijacked the Enterprise-D in 2364. Riker found her convincingly real and was disappointed when her program was lost after the Bynars left the ship. (TNG: "11001001") Her image was used by Barash's holosimulators to create a wife for Riker in the illusory future he experienced in 2367, making Riker realize the deception. (TNG: "Future Imperfect")

Lwaxana Troi
Ambassador Lwaxana Troi entered the Betazoid phase in 2365. When she visited the Enterprise, she set her sights on several male crewmembers as potential mates, including Riker. She announced their "wedding" on the bridge of the Enterprise shortly before moving on to Captain Picard. (TNG: "Manhunt")

Brenna Odell
Riker was romantically linked to the Bringloidi colonist Brenna Odell, but the relationship was limited to her brief stay aboard the ship in 2365. (TNG: "Up The Long Ladder")

Yuta
The Enterprise worked to reunite the Gatherers with their Acamarian home in 2366. Riker became involved with one of Sovereign Marouk's aides, Yuta. Yuta was actually a Tralesta who had been genetically altered to deliver a microvirus to members of another clan, the Lornak, which the Tralestas had fought centuries earlier. The last Lornak, Chorgan, was now leader of the Gatherers, and Yuta attempted to assassinate him. Data and Dr. Crusher later discovered Yuta's true nature, and Riker was forced to kill her in order to prevent Chorgan's death. (TNG: "The Vengeance Factor")

Lal
Riker returned from shore leave in late 2366 and saw Data's "daughter" Lal in Ten Forward. He did not realize that she was an android, and flirted with her. Lal immediately picked Riker up and planted a kiss on his lips, copying behavior she had observed earlier. When Data asked Riker what his intentions were with his daughter, Riker hastily left, embarrassed and confused. (TNG: "The Offspring")

Lanel
While Riker was held captive in the Malcorian hospital in 2367, a nurse named Lanel approached him and offered to help him escape if he made love to her, as it had long been her dream to do so with an alien. Riker tried to maneuver his way out of the situation by claiming there were differences between their cultures, but Lanel was persistent. It is unclear just how far the two went with their relationship, but Lanel eventually helped Riker try to escape. When asked if she would ever see him again, Riker somewhat sarcastically responded he would look her up next time he passed through her star system. (TNG: "First Contact")

Carmen Davila
Riker romanced Carmen Davila in early 2368 while some of the Enterprise crew helped establish a colony on Melona IV. However, Davila was killed when the Crystalline Entity ravaged that world. Riker wrote a brief letter to Davila's family when Starfleet informed them of her death. Riker believed that her death and the loss of countless other lives at the hands of the Entity were reason enough to destroy it rather than attempt communication. (TNG: "Silicon Avatar")

Etana Jol
Riker visited Risa later that year and met a Ktarian female named Etana. Jol was actually working for a Ktarian dissident movement which attempted to take over the Federation in 2368. She was able to get Riker addicted to the game they used in the mind control plot, which he then returned to the Enterprise. Fortunately, Data, Wesley Crusher and Robin Lefler were able to reverse the effects of the game and foil the Ktarian plot. (TNG: "The Game")

Ro Laren
When the Enterprise was affected by a Satarran memory weapon in 2368, Riker and Ensign Ro Laren felt an attraction to one another. They spent several nights together before Dr. Crusher discovered a way to restore the memories of the entire crew. (TNG: "Conundrum") Later that year, Riker later wanted to say a few words about Ro at the funeral planned when it was believed she and La Forge were dead. Ro was frustrated because she and La Forge were rephased before Riker made his speech. (TNG: "The Next Phase")

Soren
In 2368 Riker helped the J'naii rescue the crew of one of their shuttlecraft trapped in a pocket of null space. During the planning stages of the mission he became close to one of their pilots, Soren. The two were attracted to one another, a relationship forbidden by the oppressive government of the J'naii. Their relationship was discovered and Soren was arrested. She was given psychological treatment to remove her inclinations to be female. With help from Worf, Riker mounted an illicit rescue mission, but it was too late. She refused to go along with him and did not wish to be returned to the way she was before treatment. (TNG: "The Outcast")

Kamala
Kamala, a Kriosian empathic metamorph, tried to work her charms on Riker in 2368. He was able to resist her but needed to visit the holodeck after the encounter. (TNG: "The Perfect Mate")

Amanda Rogers
Amanda Rogers came aboard the Enterprise in 2369. She had a somewhat obvious crush on Commander Riker, which he found flattering but did not reciprocate. Q used her interest in him to discern whether or not she had the abilities of the Q, causing several cargo barrels to fall from a ledge onto Riker. Amanda deflected the barrels to Riker's side. Later, after Q had begun to tempt Amanda with her new-found abilities, she abducted Riker and brought him to a romantic fantasy environment. Will still turned down her advances, but Amanda then used her powers to cause him to fall in love with her. Ultimately, Amanda realized that the encounter was devoid of meaning and sent him back to the Enterprise. (TNG: "True Q")

Rebecca Smith
Will dated a new tactical officer, Rebecca Smith, in 2370. They went for a walk in the arboretum and became intimate, but the mood was ruined when Riker rolled into Cypirion cactus and was stuck by several thorns. (TNG: "Genesis")

Deanna Troi
Will Riker with Deanna Troi in 2375
Deanna Troi and Will Riker began an intense and close relationship shortly following his posting to Betazed. They referred to each other as imzadi, a Betazoid word for "beloved". Troi apparently taught Riker how to communicate telepathically, but he seemed to have lost the ability by 2364. (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint") Will later remarked that he knew Deanna better than anyone. (TNG: "Man of the People") One of their favorite and most special locations was Janaran Falls. After Riker was transferred to the Potemkin, the two stayed in touch and planned to meet at Risa in 2361, but Will was promoted shortly after the Nervala IV mission and forced to cancel their date. He made his career a priority over their relationship, and they gradually lost touch and did not see one another until they were both posted to the new USS Enterprise in 2364. (TNG: "Second Chances") It was difficult to see each other again, and Troi tried to speak to Riker alone during their mission to Farpoint Station. He maintained a distance, and she did not make another attempt. (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint") They eventually decided to keep a professional yet friendly relationship. They stayed close friends and confidants, often approaching each other either to talk or for support in times of crisis. (TNG: "Violations", "Second Chances") As first officer and counselor, they were required to manage crew evaluations every three months. (TNG: "Man of the People", "Lower Decks")

While under the influence of the polywater intoxication in 2364, Troi attempted to seduce Riker, but Riker maintained control and brought her to sickbay. (TNG: "The Naked Now")

Riker was dismayed to learn of Troi's betrothal to Wyatt Miller in 2364. Troi reassured him that he would always be a special part of her life and that she still cared for him greatly. Riker was delighted when Troi remained aboard the Enterprise after Miller left to help the Tarellians recover from a plague. (TNG: "Haven")

Riker and Troi attended the funeral service for Natasha Yar together after she was killed by Armus in 2364. Riker comforted Troi during and following the event. (TNG: "Skin of Evil")

Troi was impregnated by an alien life form in early 2365. Riker had mixed feelings about the pregnancy and resultant child, but was with Troi for the birth and supported her during the ordeal, especially after the child sacrificed himself to save the Enterprise. (TNG: "The Child")

Troi was visibly upset when Riker almost accepted assignment to the Aries in 2365. (TNG: "The Icarus Factor")

When Riker was affected by the predatory plant microbe picked up on Surata IV, Troi stayed with him through his convalescence. She was present during his treatment and relayed the emotions Will was experiencing to Dr. Pulaski, giving her indication of which memories to activate and which to suppress. (TNG: "Shades of Gray")

During the negotiations for the Barzan wormhole in 2366, Riker was challenged by the Chrysalian representative, Devinoni Ral, in more ways than one. Ral and Troi began a romantic relationship, and Ral used this to intimidate Riker. However, the Barzan wormhole was later determined to be worthless and Riker gleefully withdrew the Federation bid in front of Ral, who had just secured rights for the Chrysalians through underhanded means. (TNG: "The Price")

Later that year, Troi backed off when Riker made his interest in Yuta known. (TNG: "The Vengeance Factor") She stood by him after he was accused of Dr. Nel Apgar's murder, even when it seemed he must be guilty. After he was exonerated, she squeezed his hand in affection. (TNG: "A Matter of Perspective")

The couple tried to take a romantic holiday on Betazed in 2366, but were interrupted by Lwaxana Troi. A Ferengi DaiMon, Tog, later arrived to kidnap Lwaxana, taking Deanna and Riker with her. They later engineered an escape and were rescued by the Enterprise. (TNG: "Ménage à Troi")

The Enterprise became trapped by two-dimensional lifeforms in early 2367. They also suppressed Deanna's telepathic abilities and she found it difficult to deal with her loss. Will tried to help her cope with the trauma, but she resisted. He then called her "aristocratic" and thought she was upset because her empathic powers helped her feel superior to her shipmates. When the Enterprise was freed, her abilities were restored. She apologized to Will, but also made it clear that he was not to call her aristocratic again. (TNG: "The Loss")

Will and Deanna attended the wedding of Keiko and Miles O'Brien together. (TNG: "Data's Day")

Sometime prior to 2368, Riker and Troi had a romantic encounter following a poker night. Troi was reluctant to continue a relationship at the time and the incident remained isolated. (TNG: "Violations")

Both Riker and Troi were affected by the Satarran energy weapon, but Troi still felt a connection to Will. Her suspicions were confirmed when Riker found a copy of Ode to Psyche given to him by Troi, with the inscription "To Will, all my love, Deanna". (TNG: "Conundrum")

When Riker expressed interest in Soren, he went to see Troi in order to gain her approval of the relationship. Once again, Troi assured him that they would always be special to one another, even if they saw other people. (TNG: "The Outcast")

Ambassador Ves Alkar telepathically linked with Troi in 2369, using her as a receptacle for his "psychic waste". Troi's behavior was drastically altered and she began to rapidly age due to the stress. She appeared for a crew evaluation meeting with Riker in a seductive outfit, then revealing that she had just slept with a male junior officer. Riker claimed that he felt her love life was none of his business, but Troi continued to press the issue, causing Riker to leave. Troi later tried to kiss Riker, then scratched him for no apparent reason. Riker reported this behavior to Dr. Crusher, who uncovered Alkar's plan and broke his link with Troi. Troi thanked Riker for his support, and he promised to love her even when she became old and gray. (TNG: "Man of the People")

The discovery of Riker's double on Nervala IV complicated his relationship with Troi. That Riker had spent eight years pining for Troi and was eager to resume their relationship. He tried to have her transferred to the Gandhi, but she refused, not wanting to give up the life she had spent so long building on the Enterprise. (TNG: "Second Chances")

Lwaxana Troi felt that Riker was partly the reason Deanna was still unmarried by 2370. While suffering from strain due to repeated telepathic contact with the Cairn, Lwaxana approached WRiker in Ten Forward and yelled at him, telling him to leave Deanna alone. She later had Deanna apologize for her behavior. (TNG: "Dark Page")

Troi attempted the Bridge Officer's test in 2370. Riker supervised the tests and did not show any favoritism towards her. After she attempted the engineering qualification several times without much luck, he came to tell her the tests were canceled. However, by insisting to her that, despite their relationship, his loyalty was to the Enterprise, he gave her a hint which told her what the test was really about – her ability to send a crewmember to their death. Knowing that she would never simply give up, he entered the holodeck just in time to congratulate her on passing the test. (TNG: "Thine Own Self")

Worf began courting Troi in 2370, thankful for all of the help she had provided in Alexander's care over the prior two years. (TNG: "Parallels") Worf was concerned that Riker might feel betrayed by their relationship, and wanted to discuss the issue with Riker late that year. (TNG: "All Good Things...")

Riker and Troi stayed friends into their early years aboard the Enterprise-E. He helped her through the outcome of an alcohol binge instigated by Zefram Cochrane while they were trying to convince him to conduct his warp flight in 2063 (though he made no attempt to hide his enjoyment of witnessing her drunken behavior). (Star Trek: First Contact) However, things changed when they encountered the radiation of the Ba'ku planet in 2375. They began to playfully flirt with one another and ended up taking a bubble bath together. Their rekindled romance continued after the Enterprise left the Briar Patch. (Star Trek: Insurrection)

The two were planning to vacation in 2377. Troi arrived at the beach first; Riker was going to meet her a few days later. They later decided to spend the rest of their vacation in Tiburon instead. They invited Reg Barclay to accompany them, wanting to introduce him to a mutual friend, Maril. (VOY: "Inside Man")

Alternate realities and timelines
Riker from six hours in the future
In 2365, the USS Enterprise-D encountered the shuttlecraft El-Baz from six hours in the future, including a future version of Captain Jean-Luc Picard.  Using a variable phase inverter, a future log entry was retrieved showing Riker having escorted Captain Picard to the shuttlebay and standing in the bay while Picard departed the ship.

Riker is killed in an alternate timeline
In 2366, the USS Enterprise-C emerged from a temporal rift. Its disappearance from the year 2344 caused an altered timeline, wherein the Federation was losing a war against the Klingons. Riker was still the ship's first officer, but he was much more toughened due to the horrors of war. He questioned the plan to send the Enterprise-C back to the past, especially after Captain Rachel Garrett was killed, but Captain Picard allowed Richard Castillo to assume command and return the Enterprise-C to 2344. Riker later worked the tactical station following Tasha Yar's transfer to the Enterprise-C but was killed in a subsequent Klingon attack. (TNG: "Yesterday's Enterprise")

In 2367, Beverly Crusher became trapped in a warp bubble. Her thoughts created a universe where people and objects rapidly began disappearing. Riker was one of the last Enterprise crewmembers to vanish. (TNG: "Remember Me")

Captain Riker of a quantum reality where the Borg had decimated the Federation
Lieutenant Worf encountered a quantum fissure which caused him to begin shifting between quantum realities in 2370. In several universes, Riker was still Enterprise first officer, and planned a surprise birthday party for Worf even though Worf had made it expressly clear he did not want one. In others, he had been promoted to captain. In the final universe in which Worf arrived, Riker was the captain, as Captain Picard had been lost in the Borg encounter of 2367. In another reality, the Borg had conquered the Federation and the Enterprise was one of the few ships left. Riker was in command of that ship as well, and was desperate not to return to his universe once all of the Enterprises began spilling into a single universe. After attempting to get the attention of the present-reality Enterprise by firing lightly upon them, the Borg-damaged ship was destroyed by Capt. Riker with the alternate Riker on board to prevent further damage to his ship. The events following Worf's encounter were erased from the timeline once the fissure was sealed. (TNG: "Parallels")

In an alternate 2364, Riker was left on Farpoint Station when the Enterprise was diverted to investigate a temporal anomaly in the Devron system. (TNG: "All Good Things...")

In an alternate 2370, Riker became uncomfortable with the growing relationship between Worf and Deanna, but he refused to voice his concern. (TNG: "All Good Things...")

Admiral Riker in the anti-time future timeframe
In an unknown, alternate future timeframe, Riker had been promoted to admiral and was assigned to Starbase 247. The USS Enterprise-D, substantially refitted and upgraded, was his flagship. In this timeline, Deanna Troi had died twenty years previously, causing Worf and Riker to become estranged, as each blamed the other for preventing a relationship with her. Riker attempted to make amends at Deanna's funeral, but was rejected, possibly due to the bad timing.

Picard contacted him for help in investigating the anomaly, but Riker refused to allow him passage to the Neutral Zone, thinking Picard had been affected by Irumodic syndrome and was delusional. Later Picard convinced his ex-wife, Beverly Picard, to take her medical ship, the USS Pasteur, to investigate the anomaly. The Pasteur was attacked and destroyed by Klingon battleships, but the Enterprise arrived to rescue the crew and fight off the Klingons. Immediately Worf and Riker began to bicker. Picard once again pleaded with Riker to return to the Devron system, but he was then sedated and returned to quarters. Armed with new information gathered from the other two timeframes, Picard woke and went to talk to Riker and the other former Enterprise officers. He convinced them that the anomaly existed, and the Enterprise returned just in time to watch it form. Riker ordered the Enterprise into the anomaly, where it used a static warp shell in concert with the other Enterprises to collapse it. During this time, Riker made an overture to Worf that was accepted, asking for his old friend's help on the bridge.

After the anomaly was sealed, the timelines were erased and only Captain Picard retained memory of those events. Picard told his staff of his experiences in the future, in hopes that things such as the conflict between Worf and Riker would never happen. (TNG: "All Good Things...")

Holograms
Riker seeing himself in Krag's holoprogram
William Riker was holographically duplicated on a number of occasions.

In 2366, on Stardate 43610.4, a series of holographic simulations, Deposition Program Riker One, Hypothetical Krag One, Manua Simulation One, Tayna Simulation Three, and La Forge One, were used by Krag in his investigation into the murder of Nel Apgar, of which Riker was suspected. (TNG: "A Matter of Perspective")
Later that year, on Stardate 43807.4, at least two holographic recreations of Riker were created by Lieutenant Reginald Barclay when he suffered from holoaddiction. One was on a recreation of the Enterprise-D; the other was part of The Three Musketeers and was considerably shorter than the real Riker. Troi believed that the latter's short stature was due to the fact that Barclay found Riker's height intimidating. (TNG: "Hollow Pursuits")
In 2368, on Stardate 45254.8, a hologram of Riker was used to fool Sela so Spock, Captain Picard, and Data could escape from Romulus. Picard told Data that he did not get the hair quite right. (TNG: "Unification II")
In 2369, on stardate 46424.1, a hologram of Riker was used by James Moriarty to trick Picard into releasing his command codes. Another was used in turn by Picard to trick Moriarty into releasing his control over the Enterprise-D. (TNG: "Ship in a Bottle")
Miscellaneous information
The personnel files of Thomas and William T. Riker in 2371
Riker's quarters on the Enterprise-D were on Deck 8, room 0912. (TNG: "The Best of Both Worlds", "Night Terrors", "Chain of Command, Part II")

By 2369, Riker had been decorated by Starfleet five times. (TNG: "Chain of Command, Part I")

Riker replaced the trombone that he had given Thomas Riker with a King 3B 2103 "Legend" tenor trombone. (TNG: "Thine Own Self")

Riker spoke "a little" of the Klingon language (TNG: "The Emissary") and had a rudimentary knowledge of the Romulan language, specifically Romulan curses. (TNG: "The Enemy", "The Defector")
