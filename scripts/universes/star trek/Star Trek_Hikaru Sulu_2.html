<html><p>Chekov became Sulu's closest friend among the Enterprise officers after joining the bridge crew in 2267, and they often shared jokes, observations, and opinions with each other while on duty. Both of them were at a loss to figure out what was going on when the Enterprise kept changing course back and forth between Vulcan and Altair VI, but by the time Captain Kirk finally settled on Vulcan they were a step ahead of him and already had the course change ready to lay in. (TOS: "Amok Time")

Chekov looked over at Sulu with a smile when Kirk used the corbomite bluff against the Romulans, which suggested that Sulu had filled him in on what "corbomite" was, since Chekov was not on the bridge the first time Kirk used that trick against the First Federation and Balok. (TOS: "The Deadly Years")

They both expressed surprise at Scott's attraction to the bookish Lieutenant Mira Romaine, although Sulu wondered aloud if Scott had even noticed her brain yet. (TOS: "The Lights of Zetar")

Sulu and Chekov also confided in each other. When Chekov was the only member of an Enterprise landing party not afflicted with rapid aging, he complained bitterly to Sulu about the large volume of tests to which he had been subjected to by Dr. McCoy and the medical department. Sulu tried to make him feel better by reminding him that at least he was going to live. (TOS: "The Deadly Years")

Prior to the appearance of the Beta XII-A entity, Sulu was apparently the only member of the senior staff who knew that Chekov had no siblings dead or alive. (TOS: "Day of the Dove")

Sulu and Chekov mutiny against the captain when Dr. Janice Lester was in control of Kirk's body
When Dr. Janice Lester used a life-entity transfer to switch bodies with Captain Kirk, Sulu and Chekov formed a united front against the captain after the captain ordered the executions of Spock, Lester (with Kirk in her body), Scott, and Dr. McCoy, both reminding the Captain that the death penalty was forbidden and later refusing the captain's orders to place the ship in standard orbit at Benecia to strand the prisoners there. Sulu and Chekov simultaneously took their hands off their station's controls. This act of joint defiance threw Lester into a rage that almost broke the transference between her and Kirk and was the start of getting Kirk back into his own body. (TOS: "Turnabout Intruder")

Sulu and Chekov get lost while hiking together in 2287
During shore leave rotations while the Enterprise-A was brought up to working condition, Sulu and Chekov decided to take their leave together and go on a hiking trip. Ironically they wound up getting lost, though Sulu with characteristic good humor told Chekov that they were still making good time. When Sulu lied to Uhura about being caught in a blizzard as an excuse for not being able to find their way back to the pickup zone, Chekov rolled his eyes but gamely (though unsuccessfully) tried to support his friend's claim by blowing into the communicator. (Star Trek V: The Final Frontier)

There is only one known instance of open conflict between Sulu and Chekov, and it was neither one's fault. When the interphase region near Tholian space drove Chekov temporarily insane he snapped and attacked Sulu, who happened to be the closest person to him. Several members of the bridge crew quickly restrained him and kept Sulu from being seriously injured. And when Chekov finally collapsed due to Spock trying to calm him, Sulu allowed Chekov to collapse in his helm chair and cradled Chekov's head in his hands so it wouldn't fall onto the helm console until the medical department and security teams could take him to sickbay. Sulu later told Spock that Chekov had exhibited several spasms of pain beforehand. (TOS: "The Tholian Web")

Uhura
Early in the five-year mission, there were hints of Sulu's future relationship with Uhura. When she temporarily took over the navigation station during combat with a Romulan vessel in 2266. He paused a moment to assess her as she sat down. (TOS: "Balance of Terror")

While Sulu was under the effects of the Psi 2000 polywater intoxication, he made his way to the bridge armed with a sword and grinned when he saw Uhura, declaring her a "fair maiden" (despite her protest that she was neither) and promising to "protect" her. (TOS: "The Naked Time")

In 2267, Sulu and Scott were the first two bridge crew to come to Uhura's aide when she had her memories probed and then wiped clean by the probe Nomad, leaving her in a foggy daze. Sulu also assisted a command division ensign in helping Uhura to sickbay. (TOS: "The Changeling")

Eventually becoming close friends, Uhura was willing to keep his secret when he didn't want to admit to being lost while on a hiking trip in 2287. (Star Trek V: The Final Frontier)

Love interests
In 2268, Sulu was briefly interested in one of Doctor Sevrin's followers, who encouraged him to join their movement. When Kirk asked him to explain what he was doing, a flustered Sulu couldn't provide an answer. (TOS: "The Way to Eden")

A female companion
The following year, during the Enterprise's encounter with a being who called himself Lucien, it was found that members of the crew could perform magic as part of their being in the alternate universe that Lucien lived. Utilizing this magic, Sulu conjured for himself a beautiful female companion. As the two prepared to leave the bridge, Uhura wished him "good luck," only for the female companion to suddenly change form into Lucien, who scolded the crew for misusing the magic. (TAS: "The Magicks of Megas-Tu")

A few years later, Sulu again fell under the infatuation one would have being in the presence of the Deltan Ilia. He was ultimately rebuffed when told that she was celibate. Ilia also looked back at him when his back was turned, but nothing came of it. (Star Trek: The Motion Picture).

Background information
Toyota as stunt-Sulu
Sulu was played by George Takei. 

Takei's stunt double in the episode "Catspaw" was Vic Toyota. 

Name origins
According to George Takei, Roddenberry named him for the Sulu Sea, which he thought of as touching all the shores of Asia.  It has been conjectured by Michael and Denise Okuda that "Sulu" was an anglicized version of the Japanese word tsuru, the word for the red-crested crane, a national treasure of Japan and a symbol of leadership, courage, and long life. (Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home text commentary) However, in the book Inside Star Trek: The Real Story, production executive Herb Solow stated that Gene Roddenberry named Sulu after him, as a joking tribute to his surname, which can be (incorrectly) pronounced "Sulu".

Sulu's surname cannot be truly Japanese, as the Japanese language, while syllabic, does not contain the "L" phoneme in any form. In the Japanese version of Star Trek, his family name was consequently changed to "Kato", a common surname. (citation needed • edit)

After almost thirty years of being called "Mister", Sulu finally earned a given name, Hikaru, in the film Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, though it had been used in fan circles since it was introduced in Vonda N. McIntyre's 1981 novel The Entropy Effect. McIntyre created the name, taking it from The Tale of Genji, because she needed to write a love scene featuring Sulu, and she "couldn't figure out how to write a love scene where the protagonists called each other by their surnames."  "Hikaru" was also given in the script of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home as the name of a young boy whom Sulu later realized was his great-great grandfather.

Heritage
In a deleted scene from TOS: "The Corbomite Maneuver", Sulu revealed that he often enjoyed watching, during his boyhood, Fu Manchu movies about the Sino-Western trouble, in which the villains were Orientals. He never understood what the films were about but admittedly "loved" the antagonists in them. Wanting to be like those Orientals, the boy Sulu spent hours sitting in front of a mirror practicing their "drooping eyelids" and "mysterious expressions." ("Inside the Roddenberry Vault, Part I", Star Trek: The Original Series - The Roddenberry Vault special features) In the second revised final draft script, Sulu, regarding his not having become like them in his adulthood, then remarked, "I can't figure out why I'm like this. I don't have a drop of Western blood."

Regarding Sulu's heritage, George Takei himself said, "Sulu is a genuine 23rd-century human being as opposed to some of the other characters who tend to be ethnocentric. Like, for example, very Scottish to the point of having a brogue, or very Russian to the point of everything being 'invented in Russia.' Sulu is a person who considers the heritage of human culture, human history, his heritage and so his reference is a very broad one." Takei felt the "pan-cultural heritage that Sulu feels" was made evident in such scenes as the one where the character, with his inhibitions loosened by polywater intoxication in TOS: "The Naked Time", imagines himself as French swashbuckler D'Artagnan. "He's obviously a very capable, bright member of the Starfleet Officer Corps," Takei continued. "He has great ambitions. His career pattern is essentially one that was molded on the example set by Kirk. He wants to follow in Kirk's footsteps. Sulu also has a lot of private life that we really have not had a chance to examine." (Cinefantastique, Vol. 27, No. 11/12, pp. 34-35)

Cuts
Sulu was scripted to appear in "The Conscience of the King" (featured in the final revised draft of that episode's teleplay), but his part in the installment was evidently given to Lieutenant Leslie instead. 

Sulu was likewise scripted, only initially, to appear in "Court Martial" (at least referred to if not also making an appearance in the episode's first draft script, and appearing in the final draft and revised final draft of the teleplay). In the first draft of "Court Martial", he was mistakenly referred to as "Sumo". However, Gene Roddenberry addressed this issue (among others) in a six-page memo of script notes he sent Gene L. Coon (on 15 August 1966). Most of Sulu's involvement in "Court Martial" was ultimately substituted by Lieutenant Hansen. In the climax of the story, Sulu was also scripted to say the lines, "Variance fading," and, "All secure, sir," though those lines are spoken by Uhura in the final edit of the episode. 

Sulu was additionally scripted to appear in "The Menagerie, Part I" and "The Menagerie, Part II", although he was again substituted by Hansen instead.

Takei and Director David Livingston, taking cues for the depiction of Sulu in VOY: "Flashback" from the episode's script
After Sulu's appearance in Star Trek VI, there was a fan-based campaign to start a TV series based on the adventures of his crew during his stint as captain of the Excelsior. However, it never drew enough support for Paramount to start production on it.   Nonetheless, Takei was featured as Captain Sulu once again for the 30th anniversary of The Original Series in the Voyager episode "Flashback".

Apocrypha
The novel Spock, Messiah! states that Sulu was born on Alpha Mensa V.

The comic "Who's Who in Star Trek 2" states that Sulu was born in Los Angeles and gives his full name as "Hikaru Kato Sulu". His parents were named Hosato Sulu (a poet) and Momiko Sulu (a xenobiologist).

The "Kato" middle name also appears in Portuguese translations of Pocket Books TOS novels published by Editora Aleph.

According to The Best of Trek, Sulu's middle name was given as Walter. The FASA role-playing game seems to agree, giving Sulu's name as "Hikaru W. Sulu". Before "Hikaru" was canonically established as Sulu's first name, "Walter" was a popular choice in fandom as an alternate. 

Sulu's first name was given as "Itaka" in the Star Trek newspaper comic strip. Its use was based on information from the fan fiction publication USS Enterprise Officer's Manual, by Geoffrey Mandel and Doug Drexler and published by Interstellar Associates in 1980.

According to Star Trek II: Biographies, Sulu was born in 3 July 2141 in Wailuku, Maui, Hawaii to parents Liholiho Sulu and Kalea Graef Hatoyama. He has two siblings named Kamehameha Fujiwara Sulu and Liliuokalani Dani Sulu.

According to the Eighth UK Story Arc, Sulu was raised with a deep-rooted fear of the supernatural. His mother's name was Shimizu Hana Sulu according to Excelsior: Forged in Fire and "Iron and Sacrifice" in Tales from the Captain's Table.

In Dwellers in the Crucible, Sulu was sent undercover as a Romulan into the Romulan Star Empire after the Romulans kidnap six Federation hostages. While preparing for his mission, it was revealed that Sulu had a tendency to talk in his sleep. He eventually made his way to Remus and managed to send a short coded message to the Enterprise.

Three of Sulu's later adventures (during and post-Excelsior) are chronicled in the audio-only Simon and Schuster Audioworks Captain Sulu Adventures series: Transformations, Cacophony, and Envoy.

According to William Shatner's novel The Return Sulu retired and entered politics, eventually being elected President of the United Federation of Planets.

Sulu featured prominently in the novels The Kobayashi Maru depicting his academy days, Prime Directive wherein he works outside Starfleet, The Entropy Effect wherein he considers another career, and Home Is the Hunter wherein he was sent back to ancient Japan. In the DS9 novel Day of Honor: Armageddon Sky, an aged Starfleet officer identifying himself only as "George" is strongly hinted to be Hikaru Sulu.

According to the video game Star Trek: Starship Creator, Sulu married a woman named Yoshika.

In Star Trek Online, Hikaru Sulu's great-grandson Akira Sulu is stationed on the Earth Spacedock.

In Star Trek Cats, Sulu is depicted as a Japanese Bobtail cat.
