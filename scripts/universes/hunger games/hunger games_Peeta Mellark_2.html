<html><p>In the epilogue, Katniss and Peeta have children after 15 years of being together, and they find a meadow to settle down in. Katniss and Peeta are still haunted by the memories of the Games but find ways to carry on living and cope with their trauma, living in peace with their children.

Gale Hawthorne
Peeta admits to having been jealous of Gale for a long time, having watched him and Katniss from afar for many years and realizing the depth and strength of their relationship.

In Catching Fire, Peeta knew Katniss had feelings for Gale and accepted that he would allow Katniss to be with him if it brought her happiness. When Gale was whipped, Peeta stepped in on his behalf and afterward helped carry him to Victor's Village. Later, while training for the Quarter Quell, Gale teaches Peeta and Haymitch about snares and trapping. Gale stated that he tried to hate Peeta, but it was just too hard because Peeta is too good of a person.

In the arena, Peeta gave Katniss a locket with a picture of Gale inside. He plans to sacrifice himself so that Katniss makes it out of the Quell alive and tells her that he wants her to have a life and children with Gale after he is gone.

In Mockingjay, Gale volunteered first to be on the squad to break into the Capitol and retrieve Peeta from prison. It is unknown whether he did this for Katniss or out of genuine concern for Peeta. Confused and suspicious of Katniss due to his hijacking, Peeta on more than one occasion expresses jealousy of Gale. When Peeta joins Squad 451, Gale does not hesitate to offer to kill him for Katniss but does help him play "Real or Not Real?" later.

Also in Mockingjay, Katniss wakes to a hushed conversation between an injured Gale and semi-hijacked Peeta. Gale helps Peeta drink some water, as his hands are cuffed. They speak like friends and talk about Katniss. Katniss' internal monologue mentions that Gale and Peeta "aren't friends" and "never have been. Though they're not exactly enemies." During this conversation, Gale expresses regret for not having volunteered in Peeta's place during the 74th Games, preventing her and Peeta's relationship altogether. Peeta reminds him that Katniss would probably resent him greatly for abandoning their families in such a situation. Peeta also claims that Katniss is in love with Gale, while Gale denies it and asserts that she loves Peeta. Peeta wonders how Katniss will choose between them, and Gale says that she will choose whoever "she thinks she can't survive without."

Haymitch Abernathy
Peeta and Haymitch did not get off on the right foot, fighting with each other over Haymitch's drinking habits on the train ride to the Capitol before the 74th Hunger Games. The two later work together often and become good friends with each other. Haymitch favored Peeta since he was very useful and good. He admits that he likes Peeta better. Peeta and him form plans together like Peeta's act of love to Katniss. Peeta is able to be told secrets and plans by Haymitch and keep them to himself. Haymitch does not help Peeta during the 74th Hunger Games.

Haymitch is hurt when he is taken away by the Capitol and feels guilty for allowing this to happen. Although he does not admit it, Haymitch truly loves Peeta. Peeta is attacked by Haymitch to see if he will put up a fight in the arena which he is pleased when he and Katniss both show strength against him by ganging up. Haymitch forms plans and informs him of all his plans during the preparation for the games. Haymitch helps him and the two both become close to each other. Haymitch and Peeta work together to form the plan of the 'star-crossed lovers of District 12' act to gain sympathy from the audience. Haymitch is overjoyed when both he and Katniss come back alive. He does everything he can to prevent them from being harmed by the Capitol since they are enraged by the suicide act with the berries in the arena.

Haymitch is somewhat hurt when Peeta is angry at him for keeping secrets from him and is deeply hurt when President Snow announces the third Quarter Quell will be reaping victors since Peeta may die. Haymitch is deeply concerned when Peeta is captured by the Capitol. He and Katniss both work together to rescue Peeta. Haymitch and Katniss try their best to help Peeta through the stress and effects of the tracker-jacker venom they used to hijack his memories. The two reconnect at the end of Mockingjay.

Effie Trinket
Peeta seemed to get along well with Effie, never giving her many problems. Peeta did anger her when he and Katniss joked around about Haymitch being drunk during the reaping and making a fool of himself on national television. Effie yells at them telling them he is their only lifeline and the only thing keeping them
 alive. Peeta is kind to her and always follows her plans. Effie did try to do her best for him and Katniss during the games. Effie was sad the night before the 74th Hunger Games and couldn't bear say her goodbyes because she truly does love him. Peeta tolerated her nagging during the Victory Tour. There was no known interaction between Effie and Peeta during Mockingjay.


Finnick Odair
Finnick helping Peeta while in the Capitol.
In Catching Fire, Finnick and Peeta ally, along with Mags, Katniss, and later, Beetee, Johanna, and Wiress. Finnick saves Peeta's life after Peeta runs into a forcefield—initially, Katniss believes Finnick is actually kissing Peeta, while he is really performing CPR.

During the events of Mockingjay, Finnick shows concern for Katniss and Peeta, and goes out of his way to save Peeta's life again. Before Finnick's death, they are shown to be friendly enough with each other, with Peeta having baked and iced Finnick and Annie's wedding cake. Peeta seems rather regretful or Finnick's death toward the end of Mockingjay and in the epilogue.

Johanna Mason
Peeta and Johanna are known to have been tortured together in the Capitol along with Annie Cresta and possibly Enobaria. Johanna later reveals that the two are "familiar with each other's screams." They were also allies in the 75th Hunger Games.

Portia
Portia was Peeta's stylist in the 74th and 75th Hunger Games and details of their relationship are unknown. They were most likely friends and got along very well considering the fact in Catching Fire he briefly makes a comment about her.

Primrose Everdeen
Not much is shown about Prim’s and Peeta’s relationship in the books. However, in the films, Prim was chosen as the person to tell Peeta about the fires in District 12. After Prim’s death, Peeta plants primroses in her memory.
