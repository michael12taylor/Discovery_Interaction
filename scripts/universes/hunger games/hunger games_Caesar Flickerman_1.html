The 75th Hunger Games


Caesar with Katniss for her 74th Hunger Games interview.
In the 73rd Hunger Games, his color was crimson and he looked like he was bleeding. Katniss says that his look in the 74th Hunger Games looked much better. He is shown to help tributes in each district with their interviews. In that year, his hair, lips and eyelids were dyed powder blue. While Caesar interviews Rue, they discuss her chances of winning, because the odds are against her. Rue says that she is fast and if they can't catch her they can't kill her and to not count her out, to which Caesar replies "I wouldn't in a million years."

While interviewing Katniss, he helps her because she doesn't do well in front of cameras. For example, when he asks Katniss what she liked the most since she came to the Capitol, she answers, "The lamb stew." He remarks that he can eat it by buckets and makes a horrified face when he asks the crowd if it shows. The crowd reassures him that it doesn't.

Caesar with Peeta the night of the 74th Hunger Games interviews.
When he interviewed Peeta, the two of them were described as a good team, feeding off of each other and bantering easily. It was to Caesar in this interview that Peeta first revealed his love for Katniss, shocking everyone. The interview was said to have gone down amazingly with the audience.

Capture of Peeta Mellark
Caesar interviews Peeta
In Mockingjay, Caesar interviews a tortured Peeta. Caesar asks him questions like how he feels about the rebels and Katniss. While Peeta is explaining, he tells him and the audience how it feels to be in the Hunger Games, which fascinates them because no victor has ever spoken of this. Caesar tries to make Peeta as comfortable as possible during the interview. It is cut short when Peeta asks to go back to his cell, due to Caesar's comments on Katniss and her place in the rebellion.

Caesar interviews Peeta for the second time. This interview is short, during this interview the two exchange empty comments to each other. Caesar asks Peeta about the rumors of Katniss shooting a propo. Peeta tells him that she probably doesn't know what they are doing to her and to not trust them. The last thing Peeta says before the interview ends is for Katniss to find out what they are doing. Caesar interviews Peeta a third time. During the interview, Peeta states he thinks they should end the war with a ceasefire because if they have a war it could mean the end of all living things. Caesar questions Peeta's statement and asks him more on his thoughts of the rebellion. Peeta warns the rebels of the impending bomb attack from the Capitol on District 13. The interview is cut short when the Peacekeepers go on stage and beat Peeta and take him away to receive a punishment.

Against the Rebellion
In The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2, Caesar is featured in a Capitol announcement about the alleged death of Katniss and Squad 451 in a Peacekeeper attack, when actually only Leeg 1 and Leeg 2 were killed. His ultimate fate is not revealed in the books, but Collins later revealed in an interview that he survived. Presumably he was spared due to being seen as a forced mouthpiece and his trying to bring out the best in every tribute, though it is unlikely that he kept is job as a presenter, except possibly for the final few broadcasts announcing the surrender and the new laws before retiring.

Personality
Caesar makes Peeta feel at ease.

Caesar is known for being helpful and brings out the best in the tributes. Katniss also notes that she thinks Caesar acts like this so that the tributes don't get worried or nervous. He is also known to like the Capitol's lamb stew. He thinks of himself as a little on the "tubby" side and loves Katniss' interview dress in the first book and asks her to twirl. It says in the book that Caesar can make a weak response into a memorable one. Like most Capitol citizens and TV personale, Flickerman has had noticeable surgery done on his face as noted by Katniss, and is rather interested in the arts of fashion as displayed with his vibrant and colorful costumes and suits. He is well liked by the Capitol citizens audiences, yet seems to have some sympathy for the tributes of the Games and honestly tries to bring the best out of them and increase their chances of survival.  

Caesar's Capitol Portrait
Stanley Tucci remarked that he thought Caesar to be "creepy, with the sort of false generosity and duplicity." Others view Flickerman's deameanor more as that of an amiable talk show host looking only to make the interviews memorable to the audience.

Relationships
In the novel, Claudius Templesmith and Caesar have no known relationship. But in the film adaptation, while watching the chariot rides and actual Hunger Games, Claudius and Caesar are shown to be agreeing on many things and laughing.

Trivia
It is unknown whether any particular real-world talk show hosts were inspirational to the character of Caesar Flickerman, though Stanley Tucci did suggest that some existed in a special feature on the Blu-Ray of Catching Fire. It appears that Caesar is a sort of conglomerate of them in general.
Another underrated analysis of the character would be Flickerman's real life alternate, Ri Chun-hee, a North Korean broadcaster known as the "woman in pink". Chun-hee was both the face and voice of propaganda for Kim Jong-un's totalitarian government the same way Flickerman was for President Snow's totalitarian regime. Both are known for being flashy in terms of fashion and seemingly sympathetic and welcoming in terms of personality but menacing considering the figures and ideals they support. In November 2017, Chun-hee was the first to report North Korea's nuclear missile testing, which sent the international society--particularly that of the United States--into a panic. A few years before, she was the first to deliver the news that North Korea's former leader, Kim Jong-il, had died. In the second part of the adaptation of Mockingjay, Flickerman was the first to formally announce the supposed death of Katniss Everdeen. Another interesting parallel between the two would be the fact that Chun-hee was forced to constrain her grief when delivering the news of Jong-il's death while Flickerman had to constrain his sympathy for the tributes during the Quarter Quell special he hosted when the audience stood up to oppose the Hunger Games given Katniss' false pregnancy that Peeta announced.  In the first novel, Katniss notes that she remembers Flickerman hosting the games for a while, and that he had not aged. Chun-hee was also notable for her longtime standing as a broadcaster for the North Korean news network. 
Author Suzanne Collins stated in 2011, while the first film was in production, that Caesar survived the rebellion and fall of the Capitol as he was not directly affiliated with Snow.
The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes features a character named Lucretius "Lucky" Flickerman, a popular weatherman for Capitol TV who is tapped to be the first Hunger Games host for the 10th Hunger Games. It is possible he may be an ancestor or other relative of Caesar Flickerman.</p></html>
