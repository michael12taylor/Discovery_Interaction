<html><p>A few days later, Katniss watches another interview with Peeta and becomes overwhelmed. When Peeta warns them of the attack, he is beaten, and his blood splatters across the screen. Katniss sees this and goes into shock. She backs up Haymitch's theory that it is a warning of a bombing, and the inhabitants of District 13 retreat to a safe bunker. When Mrs. Everdeen arrives and is not with Prim, Katniss deduces that she went back for Buttercup. She stops the doors from being closed and locked in time for Prim and Gale to enter. Katniss stays with her family in one area, and after the first bombing, Mrs. Everdeen leaves to the first aid station to help. Katniss is worried about Peeta, but Prim comforts her and tells her President Snow wouldn't kill him because he needs him. Katniss asks what she thinks will happen to Peeta, to which Prim replies, whatever it takes to break her. Katniss plays with Buttercup during the night with a flashlight and imagines how she can get Peeta back. She goes to Finnick and shares her ideas on Snow's plan. Finnick tells Katniss he is doing the same but with Annie. The two continue to talk about President Snow's plan.

Rescue of Peeta
Katniss in the remains of District 12.
Katniss, while shooting a propaganda, announces she can't take it anymore, then breaks down along with Finnick. President Coin assembles a rescue team to retrieve all victors in the Capitol, and Gale is the first person to volunteer. In a daring rescue, Peeta and other victors, apart from Enobaria, are rescued from the Capitol. Katniss feels helpless when she is left out of the rescue mission. When she goes to visit Finnick, the two talk about the mission and how if they die, it won't be bad because they won't have to feel any more pain. Haymitch informs them that they can help by shooting a propaganda. Katniss does an interview and tells them how she met Peeta and informs them of the time when President Snow told her the Capitol is fragile. She tells them it is because the Capitol depends on the districts, and without them, they would fall. Katniss is informed the rescue party had arrived home safe. She sees Johanna and Annie are alive and that Peeta has been saved. However, Peeta has been hijacked into hating Katniss, and tries to strangle her to death upon their reunion.

Hijacked Peeta
Katniss receives medical attention after the attempted strangulation. Prim comforts Katniss and they are informed by Plutarch that Peeta was brainwashed by the Capitol and is receiving all the treatment they can give him. Katniss is deeply depressed by this and goes to visit Gale and Beetee. She is sad that Gale and Beetee are building weapons to help their efforts but aren't thinking about the innocent people who may be injured in the process. Katniss meets Delly Cartwright and informs her of Peeta's condition. Katniss watches Delly talk to Peeta and his outburst to her, shouting that Katniss is a muttation and District 12's destruction is her fault. Katniss tells Plutarch if she is going to be the mockingjay, he must send her away from Peeta. She asks to be taken to the Capitol so she can end the war by killing Snow, but Plutarch tells her she can't until all the districts are on the rebels' side.

Going to District 2
Plutarch tells Katniss District 2 is the only district still with the Capitol because District 2 and the Capitol have a close relationship with each other. District 2 supplies the Capitol with Peacekeepers and Stone and the Capitol pays a lot in return, therefore being a wealthier district, and so she asks to be sent to District 2.

Katniss goes to District 2 with Haymitch, Boggs, Gale, and Beetee and meets Lyme at The Nut. While there, the group tries to think of a way to attack in, which would give them control over District 2. Gale suggests that they blow up the inside of The Nut, which upsets Katniss because Gale is willing to kill innocent people for the rebellion.

Battle of the Capitol
Katniss and Gale dressed as Capitol citizens.
The rebels take control of the districts and finally begin an assault on the Capitol itself, which Katniss is a part of. However, an assault on a "safe" Capitol neighborhood goes wrong, and Katniss and her team flee further into the Capitol with the intent of finding and killing President Snow. While he is hijacked, he is driven to kill Katniss, but fought it off by remembering memories of Katniss and his deep love for her. Peeta wanted to die because he had impulses to kill her; on several occasions, he asks her to shoot him, give him nightlock, or just leave him to die. Peeta feared he would eventually overpower Katniss. Nonetheless, she stayed by him and comforted him. Eventually, they both became closer and their love became deeper. The squad goes further into the Capitol, dressed as Capitol citizens. Eventually, Katniss finds herself pressing on alone towards Snow's mansion which has supposedly been opened to shelter Capitol children (but is actually intended to provide human shields for Snow). Afterward, bombs placed in supply packages kill many of these children and a rebel medical team, including Katniss' sister, Prim.

Katniss is burned by the explosion but receives medical attention at the Capitol hospital. President Coin visits her and tells her the rebels have won and she has saved Snow for Katniss to kill. Though Snow is tried and found guilty, he tells Katniss the final assault that killed Prim was ordered by President Coin, not the Capitol. Katniss realizes that if that was true, the bombing may have been the result of a plan originally developed by Gale. Katniss doubts this, but still realizes that she will never be able to look at Gale the same way, regardless of whether he was directly involved in Prim's death.

Death of Alma Coin
Coin gathers the seven remaining victors who survived and proposes a final Hunger Games but with the children of the most powerful people in the Capitol. Peeta, Annie, and Beetee vote no, but Johanna, Enobaria, Haymitch, and Katniss all vote yes. 

Katniss about to kill Snow.
Katniss remembers a conversation with Snow in which they promised not to lie to each other. When she is supposed to execute Snow, she realizes that he was telling the truth and kills Coin instead. A riot ensues and Snow is found mysteriously dead, having possibly choked on his own blood or trampled by the crowd. Katniss is admitted to a secure holding room but acquitted due to her apparent insanity and returns to her home in District 12, while Gale goes to District 2 to work in the military and Mrs. Everdeen begins practicing at a District 4 hospital, unable to go back to District 12 due to the pain. Still destroyed over the death of Prim, Katniss becomes depressed and suicidal.

Peeta returns soon after as well, having recovered immensely from his brainwashing. He plants primroses around Katniss' house as a memorial for her sister. Katniss begins to heal, and her relationships with Peeta and Haymitch recover as well. After a while, Katniss and Peeta put together a book of all of the characters that died at the end of the series. Katniss writes all of the facts about the victims, including Rue, Prim, Boggs, Finnick, and more. Peeta draws all of the pictures in the book, if they had not found a picture of them.

Peeta plays one final round of Real or Not and says, "You love me, real or not real?" Katniss answers back, "Real."

Adult life
In the epilogue, Katniss speaks as an adult, around twenty years later. She and Peeta have two children together-a girl and a boy. By this point, the Hunger Games are over, the arenas have been destroyed, and memorials have been built for the tributes and others who died in the wars. She and Peeta have settled in a meadow, where their children can play in peace and harmony. She dreads the day her children's innocent world is shattered by learning the details of their parents' involvement in both the Games and the war, though Peeta assures her that they will be okay, that they have each other and the book. Katniss is still affected by post-traumatic stress disorder in the years following the Games and the war. When she feels upset, she has taken to reminding herself of every good thing that she has ever seen someone do. She ruefully acknowledges that this routine is a bit of a tedious game for her, but that "there are much worse Games to play".

Relationships
Peeta Mellark
Peeta and Katniss final after the 74th Hunger Games.
Katniss mentions she can never stop owing things to Peeta. When she was starving after her father's death, he burnt some bread intentionally, and endured his mother's wrath so he could give some to her. This moment of him showing compassion gave her hope to not give up in this dark time, and to carry on living. Though she wanted to thank him, she never did. However, their eyes met in school the next day, where Katniss held a dandelion in her hands as she and Peeta looked at one another.

They both became tributes of District 12 in the 74th Hunger Games after Katniss volunteered in place of her sister, Prim. During their training, Katniss refused to trust Peeta when he did nice things for her, believing it to be part of his strategy. It isn't until Peeta reveals in an interview that he is in love with Katniss. At first furious, she apologizes for lashing out at him, feeling guilty when she realizes that Peeta's confession would be of great help to her in securing sponsors.

In the arena, he joins forces with the Careers and encounters Katniss who is hiding in a tree. Peeta suggests that they wait her out, but then helps her escape after she drops a nest of Tracker Jackers onto the Careers. Peeta risks his life to save her, holding Cato off to secure her escape. After discovering two tributes from the same team district can win as a pair, Katniss searches for Peeta, and after she finds him on the brink of death, nurses him back to health. They spend several days in a cave until he's better, with Katniss risking her life to get the medicine needed to heal his leg. During that time she kisses him, flirts with him, and even sleeps next to him in his sleeping bag, playing the part of a girl falling in love. Katniss and Peeta share a passionate kiss in the cave, which Katniss later admits to being confused about, as she experienced a 'hunger' that she had never known during this kiss, and feels it was the only kiss that they shared that was real.

After they win the Games, Peeta is heartbroken when he discovers that Katniss was mostly acting. There is a rift in their relationship after this, though Katniss admits to being confused about how she feels for Peeta, and fears letting him go and having to face the future on her own.

Katniss holding the pearl after Peeta hands it to her.
In Catching Fire they reconcile and resolve to be friends, spending time getting to know one another. Peeta comforts Katniss in the night when she has nightmares, sleeping next to her during the Victory Tour and when they are reaped for the Quarter Quell. When Katniss is injured after falling whilst climbing the electric fence around District 12, Peeta helps nurse her back to health, carrying her around her home and sketching and painting alongside her. When they are reaped, Katniss and Peeta spend several days on the rooftops of the training center, enjoying the little time they have left together in peace and contentment, watching sunrises and having picnics.

During the Quarter Quell, Peeta is electrocuted after colliding with a forcefield, and his heart stops. Though Finnick is able to restart his heart, Katniss cries and screams over him, relieved that he is alive and terrified and broken when she believed he was dead. Later, on the beach, Peeta tells Katniss that he wants her to live, as she has a family that she loves and needs, and can have a future with Gale, giving her his locket which contains a picture of Prim, her mother, and Gale. Peeta sadly reflects that no one really needs him, and it is here that Katniss realizes that she needs him. That she would never be able to recover if he were to die, and she at least realizes the depth of his love, his willingness to sacrifice everything for her. It is then on the beach she realizes how deeply she actually cares about him and kisses him naturally and passionately, not for the cameras, but out of her affection for Peeta. Like their kiss in the cave in their first Games she wishes that she could shut out anyone who's watching and for once have a moment when it is only the two of them. He later gives her a pearl, jokingly referencing a comment that Effie once made to both of their amusement. Both the locket and the pearl become precious items to Katniss which she keeps by her side at all times. Peeta is eventually separated from Katniss, and is captured by the Capitol while Katniss is taken by the rebels.

Katniss kisses Peeta.
In Mockingjay, Peeta is gone for a portion of the beginning until about halfway through the book, in which he is only shown being interviewed. Shortly after the last interview, he advises Katniss to not trust the rebels. Peeta is tortured and beaten by the Capitol as a means of breaking and affecting Katniss. He returns after Gale rescues him, but has had his memories tampered with—or hijacked. While he is hijacked, he is driven to kill Katniss, but through the help of Delly Cartwright, Haymitch, and the doctors in District 13, Peeta is able to maintain his sanity. Later, while in the Star Squad, Katniss plays a game with Peeta called "Real or not real," and Katniss helps Peeta recover and remember his deep love for her. Peeta eventually grew self-aware enough to want to die because of the impulses he had to harm Katniss; on several occasions, he asks her to shoot him, give him nightlock, or just leave him to die. Peeta feared he would eventually overpower Katniss. When Peeta was in danger of losing control, Katniss, despite the danger to her life, kissed Peeta, snapping him back into reality, and begged him to "Stay with me", to which he replied "Always".

After Prim died, he went to her house and planted primroses around her house as a memorial to her sister, who died because of the exploding parachutes. Over time, Katniss and Peeta grow back together again, and one night, echoing a "game" that they had played while he was having trouble recovering his memory, Peeta asks Katniss: "You love me. Real or not real?" She answers "Real." Katniss expresses how she feels about both Peeta and Gale—that Gale was full of fire, and altogether, not the relationship she needed. Peeta, to her, was like, "a dandelion in the spring...signaling rebirth," emphasizing that Peeta is able to help Katniss heal and move forward, and that with him there was the promise that life could once again be good. She gives in to the 'hunger' that she feels when she is with him, and after reflects that she believes that "This would have happened anyways" indicating that Katniss finally realized how deep her feelings for Peeta ran.

In the epilogue, Katniss and Peeta have children after 15 years of being together, and they find a meadow to settle down in. Katniss and Peeta are still haunted by the memories of the Games, but find ways to carry on living and cope with their trauma, living in peace with their children.

Gale Hawthorne
Gale kisses Katniss unexpectedly.
When Katniss was twelve, she met Gale Hawthorne in the woods. Their fathers had been killed in the same accident and they both provided for their families. Gale nicknamed her Catnip, after mishearing her name. They quickly became hunting partners and they taught each other about their expertise. Gale comes to bid Katniss goodbye before she leaves to compete in the Hunger Games and promises to protect Prim.

Gale shares some bread with Katniss.
Gale unexpectedly kisses Katniss in the woods, revealing his feelings for her. President Snow threatens Katniss that he will kill Gale and his family. Katniss is unable to say "I love you" back, only admitting she knows he loves her. When Gale exclaims he doesn't want anything made in the Capitol, she believes he's referring to her. Katniss prevents Gale from being whipped after found guilty of poaching, but she gets lashed across the face while doing so. Whilst Gale is stabilized, Katniss stays with him and kisses him, bringing him back to consciousness. After the Quarter Quell is announced, Katniss distances herself from him, however, feeling uncertain about what she truly feels and not wanting to waste time on 'what-ifs'. Before leaving, Katniss admits to herself that she loves Gale on some level, albeit in the limited way she can offer. After the Quell, he tells her that District 12 is destroyed but her mother and sister are okay.

Gale tries to make Katniss happy as they get closer in District 13, and they fall into the companionable relationship they had in District 12. However, as Katniss fixates on Peeta's captivity and then later torture, Gale comes to realize that he can only ever gain Katniss's attention when he is in pain. A rift develops between them in District 2, where Katniss is shocked by Gale's methods in securing the District. Later, as they storm the Capital with the Star Squad, Katniss and Gale fight alongside one another before Gale is captured and Katniss is injured in the firebombing before the Presidential Palace.

While Katniss recovers in the hospital, Gale does not visit. Later, Katniss believes the firebomb that killed Prim and the Capitol children was made by Gale. Though part of her wants to deny it, she feels she will be unable to ever disassociate that from Gale, and thus lets him go without a word. Katniss reflects in her head if she and Gale would have ever been truly happy together, or if "The dark, twisted sadness between them have grown up even without the Capitol's help," thus indicating that she feels something would have driven them apart eventually regardless of what they did.

Katniss settles back in District 12 with Peeta and is informed that Gale had gone to District 2 to take up an important job. Instead of feeling longing or anger, Katniss is only relieved, believing that Gale would move on like she would and forget about her. Katniss reflects that Gale was full of fire, much like herself, which made him unsuitable as a partner, whereas Peeta was like 'a dandelion in the spring' and that he alone could help her heal and move forward despite the sorrows of her life.

Primrose Everdeen
Katniss comforts Prim after she has a nightmare about being reaped.
Primrose Everdeen was someone who Katniss loved unconditionally as she was also Katniss's younger sister. When she was younger, Katniss hunted and traded to make life easier for her sister. Katniss got Prim a goat for her birthday. Katniss took out tessera but refused to let Prim do the same. When Prim was reaped, Katniss volunteered in her place but Prim did not want her to. Prim came to say goodbye to Katniss and made her promise to win so she could come home.

Prim and her sister Katniss.
When Katniss is in the arena, she sees that Prim and Rue are very alike. As Rue dies, she makes Katniss promise to win the Hunger Games. Katniss remembers her and Prim's promise and tries to win for both of them.

Katniss tries to protect Prim from President Snow and reminds herself she's the reason she must go on.

Prim begins giving Katniss advice during Mockingjay. After Prim is killed in a bombing, Katniss falls into a depressive state and allows herself to waste away, losing the will to live. However, when Prim's cat Buttercup (whom Katniss always disliked) arrived back in Victor's Village searching for her, Katniss snapped in anger and was able to release her grief over Prim's death, allowing her to heal and move on with her life. Peeta brings Katniss evening primroses and plants them around her house in memory of Prim.

Mrs. Everdeen
Katniss' relationship with her mother is very complicated. After her husband died in a mining accident, her mother became mentally comatose for months, not even stirring herself to feed or support her daughters. As a result, Katniss essentially took over as head of the family, who would have starved without her hunting and signing up for tesserae rations. While there wasn't outright hatred between them, Katniss never completely forgave her mother for her weakness. After she volunteered as tribute in Prim's place, Katniss harshly reminded her mother that whatever happened in the arena, she could not check out again and leave Prim on her own.

Following her victory in the 74th Hunger Games, the relationship between them improved; Katniss began to be less harsh with her mother, as well as see things from her mother's point of view. After Ms. Everdeen was able to save Gale following his flogging, Katniss grew to appreciate her mother's healing skills in a new way. When the Third Quarter Quell was announced, and it was obvious that Katniss would be reaped again, Ms. Everdeen helped her and Peeta prepare for the games, putting them on a special diet to gain strength and weight.

Madge Undersee
Katniss and Madge were often paired together in school due to having no one else. Before Katniss leaves for the Games, Madge gives her a pin with a mockingjay on it, belonging to her and originally her aunt, Maysilee Donner who was killed in the 50th Hunger Games, to remind her of home. By Catching Fire, they become close friends. Katniss teaches Madge how to shoot arrows while Madge plays piano in return. Madge dies when District 12 is bombed and Katniss shows deep sadness over her death.

Haymitch Abernathy
Katniss and Haymitch.
Haymitch Abernathy is Katniss' mentor in the 74th and 75th Hunger Games, and the victor of the 50th Hunger Games. The only reason at first that Haymitch decided to help Peeta and Katniss was because he finally got a pair of fighters that year since both assault him after he doesn't attempt to help them. Both didn't like each other at first, especially during Training when Haymitch says that Katniss has the personality of a dead slug, but in the arena, Peeta says that Haymitch and Katniss only hate each other because they're so alike. To add, Haymitch decides to help Katniss out over Peeta because of the fact that Peeta was already determined to help Katniss out. Throughout the 74th Games, Haymitch sends (or doesn't) supplies to Katniss to inform her about something happening or send her a message.

In Catching Fire, Haymitch helps Katniss aid Gale when he was whipped to her house with her mother and Prim. Haymitch and Katniss both get drunk after the reading of the card, which results in Peeta dumping all the alcohol down the drain. Katniss defends Haymitch, saying that she'll get some back. During the Training, Haymitch is disgusted with Peeta and Katniss after they directly threaten the Capitol (Katniss hanged Crane and Peeta drew Rue). At the end of the Games, Haymitch explains what he was trying to do in the arena and tells her that Peeta was captured, and Katniss scratches his face with anger.

Haymitch continues to mentor Katniss despite the end of the Games. After Peeta's captured, Katniss rejects Haymitch because she blames him for his capture. When Katniss rips her earpiece out, Haymitch scolds her and threatens her to have an implant instead, but in a large contrast, Katniss also goes to Haymitch for comfort. Katniss could not say that Thirteen was well and her too, so she starts to cry, knowing that she'll be hurting Peeta even more, so she turns to Haymitch because she knows he loves Peeta too. She sobs into his shirt, crying about Peeta and the rebellion while he holds her, saying that he understands just before she is knocked out. Haymitch also tries to protect Katniss from knowing Gale left to rescue Peeta the next day. Katniss tries to talk to him about Prim's death too, but accidentally rejects her because of his drunken state.

Later, Katniss, Peeta, and Haymitch begin to mend back together and Haymitch contributes the kids he had to mentor for the Games for Katniss's plant book.

Effie Trinket
Effie and Katniss at the 74th Hunger Games reaping.
Effie Trinket was Katniss's escort for the 74th and 75th Hunger Games. Upon first meeting them, Effie annoyed Katniss in the first Games by saying the previous year's tributes were 'savages.' This caused Katniss to purposely use bad manners, such as wiping fingers on the tablecloth, to annoy her. Effie was all about dresses and looks, but she cried once or twice. Effie was thrilled when she survived the first Games.

At the reaping of the 75th Hunger Games, Effie is seen crying for Katniss and Peeta when they are reaped, showing how much she cares for them. During the preparation for the Quarter Quell, Effie let Katniss make more of her own choices. Katniss felt bad she could not say goodbye and told Haymitch to tell her that she said goodbye. Katniss is shocked when Effie arrived before Snow's trial because she had been on the rebellion side. Katniss then realizes she does care for Effie.

Cinna
Cinna consoling Katniss before she enters the arena.
Cinna was Katniss' stylist for the Games and is said to be the only person she "really trusts". She is shocked by how normal he seemed.

Cinna consoles her before she enters the arena and says that he is not supposed to, but if he could, he'd bet on her. Katniss finds confidence in his words and thinks that maybe she should really try to win.

In her victor's house, there is a phone which had no use before she started to chat with Cinna about her talent. Since the only thing she was good at was hunting, Cinna suggested fashion designing. He took care of everything for her, including creating a book of sketches that she could show to the cameras.

Cinna designed many things for her, including her opening ceremony garment which sparked his theme.

Katniss feared for his safety before the Quarter Quell and as Katniss is in her glass cylinder, about to launch, the Peacekeepers enter and beat Cinna unconscious. This act causes Katniss to unhinge for a point, fretting that they will kill him for his design of her wedding dress. They drag him away and he is killed during interrogation. Katniss suspects this was just to throw her off guard.

Cinna had already designed her mockingjay uniform, knowing there would be a war. His last message to Katniss is written under a sketch of her pin: "I'm still betting on you."

Rue
Rue and Katniss share a laugh while bonding in the arena.
Rue and Katniss have a loving relationship. Katniss meets Rue in the training center. Rue reminds her of Prim, because of her age and size. When Katniss is in a tree, held captive by the Careers, Rue helps her escape. Katniss and Peeta saw Rue in the Training Center and Peeta described her as their "shadow". Katniss also saw Rue when she stole Cato's knife, which caused Cato to attack another tribute.

Rue asks Katniss to sing to her before she dies.
Rue trusted Katniss when she saw that Katniss was wearing a mockingjay pin. After Katniss left Rue alone to blow up the Career tributes' supplies, Rue fell into Marvel's trap and was stabbed (speared in the movies) before Katniss could save her and then Katniss killed Marvel. Rue begged Katniss to win for her, and then asked her to sing as she died. Katniss then covered Rue's body with flowers and gives the farewell symbol to District 11. This was believed to be a sign of rebellion.

She feels her promise to win for Rue more important than her promise to win for Prim.
Katniss continues to feel Rue with her. Katniss remembers Rue's death, which gives her motivation to go on.

Katniss continues to think of Rue and involves her in the book of people she cared about who were killed because of the Capitol. It is believed that Marvel dies before Rue because Katniss shot an arrow in his throat (book) heart (film) causing him to die instantly.

In Catching Fire, while in Peeta's private session, Peeta painted a picture of Rue covered in flowers.

Finnick Odair
Katniss and Finnick.
Katniss first met Finnick at the opening ceremonies for the Quarter Quell while waiting for the chariots to leave Finnick approaches Katniss and offers her sugar. Katniss remains calm and composed although she feels a little uncomfortable by how close he gets to her and even more so when Finnick implies people pay him with secrets and asks Katniss if she has any secrets worth his time. However, Katniss doesn't break his gaze and simply says she is an open book. During the three days of training, Finnick continues to be friendly to Katniss when talking to her and even offers to give her an hour of trident lessons in exchange for Katniss giving him an hour of archery instruction.

At the beginning of the 3rd Quarter Quell, Finnick Odair startled Katniss with his proposal for an alliance. She was unsure of how to react, but accepted his offer after she noticed his golden bracelet that she knew came from Haymitch. Still not fully trusting him, Katniss remained extremely wary of his every move. However, he proved his usefulness and reliability by reviving Peeta when he accidentally ran into a force field, and saved Peeta in the midst of a fight even though it meant he got wounded himself.

At the beginning of Mockingjay, Finnick was deeply distressed and unable to focus on anything but saving Annie Cresta, who had been kidnapped and was being tortured in the Capitol. One of the ways he kept himself sane was by making knots with a rope, over and over again. He later gave that same rope to Katniss to aid her during the bombing of District 13. Soon, after talking to Katniss before Boggs came, Katniss mentions the trident Beetee made for him and to put on pants, in wear he jokingly whips his hospital gown off revealing only his underwear and jokes to Katniss if she found it distracting, to which she smiles, hinting that she was glad that Finnick could at least joke around. Katniss starts to realize Finnick's problems through the last few years and how he describes what President Snow did to him.

While on the mission to President Snow's mansion, the group was attacked by lizard mutations, and Finnick was decapitated before Katniss could rescue him. As Finnick died, Katniss witnesses brief moments of his life, including a silver parachute bearing the trident that won him his Games, Mags' laugh, his life on the seas of District 4, and Annie's face.

Johanna Mason
When they first met, both Johanna and Katniss had a strong dislike for each other due to Johanna stripping in the elevator in front of her, Peeta, and Haymitch. However, once inside the arena the two were thrown together into an alliance set up by Haymitch and the rebels of District 13. Even though the two were now allies, they still didn't trust each other. Katniss believes one of them will kill the other. During the escape from the arena at the end of the Games, Johanna attacked Katniss to remove a tracking device from her arm. Katniss eventually realized what Johanna had done and warmed up to her.

After being rescued from the Capitol, Johanna and Katniss start to become friends. Johanna, knowing that Katniss is indebted to her, begins to siphon off Katniss's morphling supply. As a result of the time spent together in the hospital, the two grow closer and eventually become friends. Once they are released from the hospital, Johanna and Katniss willingly move into a compartment in District 13 together, proving their friendship. They train together to become part of a squad which would enable them to fight for the rebellion against the Capitol. Johanna, however, doesn't make it through the final test and has to stay behind while Katniss leaves for the Capitol. Before Katniss's departure, she visits Johanna in the hospital. There, Johanna makes her swear to kill Snow to make him pay for everything he has done.

Thresh
During the feast, Thresh saved Katniss from being killed by Clove. Katniss was shocked at his sudden appearance. After Thresh avenged Rue's death by crushing Clove's skull, he asked Katniss in a gentle way about Rue. Thresh was touched that Katniss took care of Rue and tried to protect her from the other tributes and felt that he owed her. He spared Katniss's life and told her to run as Cato would be there soon, as he had heard Clove's screams before she died. He said that he would only save her that time, for Rue, which means that she loved her like his little sister. Thresh also took Cato's backpack, as it would force Cato to chase him instead of Katniss, allowing her to escape. This act may have resulted in Thresh's death, which shocked and saddened Katniss, as she liked him and wanted him to win if she or Peeta did not.

During the Victory Tour, Katniss honored Thresh by including him in her speech. She stated that she didn't know him, but deeply respected him for his strength and his refusal to play the Game on anyone's grounds but his own. Katniss also thanks Thresh for sparing her life.

Mags Flanagan
 Katniss became friends with Mags and admired her bravery and selflessness. Katniss watched as Mags displayed her skill of being able to make fishhooks out of nearly anything. This skill, plus the fact that she volunteered to take Annie Cresta's place, made Katniss want Mags to be one of her allies in the arena.

Mags meeting Katniss during training.
Alliances & Packs
Although Haymitch and Cinna had expectations for Peeta and Katniss to join forces in the Hunger Games, the two did not comply. Peeta ended up in a brief alliance with the Career Tributes, while Katniss teamed up with Rue, the small tribute from District 11. Katniss had not made an attempt to form an alliance with Peeta until finding out that if both tributes from the same district are the last two alive, they can both win. After hearing the news, she finally attempts to find and form an alliance with Peeta, even though she knows he is severely injured.

Rue
Rue, being the smallest tribute, was also the most vulnerable. She reminded Katniss of Prim, who was also small and fragile. Against her better judgment, Katniss allied with Rue. Rue completely trusted Katniss, handing over her life and loyalties to her, because she had the mockingjay pin Madge gave her which reminded Rue of home.

Katniss with Rue in Arena
The two formed a bond during the 74th Hunger Games, both driven by their determination to live. Katniss came up with a plan to destroy the Career tributes food, which ended up successful. However, Rue was captured in a net as she was heading to the designated third clearing to start the fire. Katniss arrived just in time to see Marvel spear Rue in the abdomen. She fires an arrow into his neck and he dies.

Katniss stayed with Rue until she died, singing her a lullaby. Of course, Katniss sang a song that her father taught her and sang it to Rue. Out of vengeance over the unjustified death of an innocent girl, Katniss surrounds Rue's corpse with bright flowers and departs with one last gesture; the District 12 signal that shows respect and farewell. The Capitol edits this part from the games, as a result. Every call of a mockingjay reminds Katniss of Rue. In the feast, she told Thresh what was the outcome of Rue and how she was Rue's ally to get it off her conscience as she thought Thresh was about to slaughter Katniss after Clove.

In Catching Fire, as a result of Katniss's grief, Peeta paints a picture of Rue buried in flowers during his private session with the Game-makers, staging his own small rebellion and proving his refusal to play by the Capitol's rules.

Peeta Mellark
Katniss and Peeta suicide threat.
Peeta had originally joined with the Career Tributes, but this was just an act to protect Katniss and lead the Careers farther away from her. Having a not-so-secret crush on Katniss put him in the mind frame of protecting Katniss at all costs. Eventually, he fights Cato, the leader of the Careers, in order for Katniss to escape, and he is wounded terribly.

Near the end of the Games, Claudius Templesmith informs the remaining six tributes that there can be two winning victors for that year, provided that they are both from the same district. Katniss rushes to form an alliance with Peeta, who's still wounded. The two of them are an inseparable pair from then on.

Since Cinna, Haymitch, and Portia worked so hard to play up the romance from the start, Katniss tries to pretend to be fully in love with him. They keep this up until the end of the Games, after Cato has died and they are the only remaining tributes. Claudius Templesmith then again informs the two over a loudspeaker that there may only be one victor for the 74th Hunger Games, leaving the two together in the arena to fight each other to the death. Peeta begs for Katniss to kill him, willing to lay down his life for hers, but Katniss thinks of a way to let them both die together. Collecting nightlock (poisonous berries), she instructs Peeta to eat a handful of berries with her once she reaches the count of three in a double suicide. She does so under the pretense that she wishes the two lovers will never be separated, but by death, when really she suspects that rather than have no victor, the Capitol will allow them both to live. The Head Gamemaker, Seneca Crane, is shocked and desperate at the prospect of losing the remaining tributes, and so it is announced that the Games are concluded and both are victors of the 74th Games.

In the Epilogue of the final book "Mockingjay", Katniss and Peeta are married and have two children, a boy and a girl.

Victims
During the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss killed Glimmer, the female tribute from District 1, and the female tribute from District 4 by dropping a tracker jacker hive on them while they slept. The two received many stings, which resulted in death. Her next kill was Marvel, the male tribute from District 1, who drowned in his own blood after Katniss shot him in the neck after he threw a spear into Rue's stomach. During the final fight between Katniss, Peeta, and Cato (the male tribute from District 2) Cato was mortally wounded by muttations. Katniss killed him by shooting an arrow at his neck, as an act of mercy.

During the 75th Hunger Games, Katniss killed Gloss, the male tribute from District 1, after he slit Wiress's throat.

After joining the rebellion, Katniss and Gale shoot down several Capitol bombers during an air raid on District 8. During the Battle of the Capitol, she kills Peacekeepers, a female Capitol citizen, and at Snow's execution, President Coin.

Physical description
Katniss in her Reaping clothes.
Katniss has long black hair, which she normally pulls back into a long braid, olive skin, and gray eyes. After the fire in the 74th Hunger Games, after her time in the arena, her hair turned at least six inches short, it is an unknown if it was grown back - though most likely it was after her full body fix in the Capitol. She is small in stature and thin for her age as she was generally malnourished because of her district's poverty. She is thus one of the smallest tributes in her Games, but due to her outdoor life, she is strong for her size. She is also known as "The Girl on Fire" during the Hunger Games; she earns this title from her fierce personality and the outfits created for her by her stylist, Cinna. Katniss is not very image-conscious, to the dismay of Venia, one of her stylists. In the first book, her hearing in her left ear is destroyed because of the explosion caused in the arena, but it is fixed in the Capitol in the end, as are all of her other major and more minor injuries including the erasing of any scars from her years of hunting. Before entering the arena the first time, Katniss had many minor scrapes and cuts, and her outward appearance was very much imperfect. However, after she won, they were repaired by the Capitol doctors, including replacing the hearing in her left ear. Most notable about her appearance and demeanor, however, was the image she unconsciously projected, as noted by her co-tribute Peeta. In Peeta's interview, he says that a lot of boys like Katniss when asked if he likes anyone at home.

In The Hunger Games, Katniss wore worn-out clothes with hunting boots, and sometimes wore her father's old hunting coat. During the reaping, she wore her mother's blue dress. At the parade in the capitol, she wore the costume that Cinna made that gave her the name "The Girl on Fire." She wore a black unitard representing coal and lit them with synthetic fire that doesn't burn but can be quenched by a solution made to counter it. He keeps the theme by designing Katniss's interview dress, a gown made completely of precious jewels in flame colors, reflecting the lighting to make her look like she is "engulfed in flames." During the Hunger Games, she wore a hooded black jacket that fell down to her thighs and reflects body heat, tawny trousers, a sturdy brown belt, and a green button-up shirt. She also wears her Mockingjay pin. Cinna also designs her Victor dress, keeping the theme of fire, yet toning it down to candlelight to symbolize innocence other than the fiery spirit for which the theme was first created.

Katniss Everdeen's Capitol portrait.
In Catching Fire, she wore many dresses due to the victory tour held six months after the games are over. The outfit Cinna designs for the first day of the Victory Tour Katniss describes as, "Flowing black pants made of a thick, warm material. A comfortable white shirt. A sweater woven from green and blue and gray strands of kitten-soft wool. Laced leather boots that don't pinch my toes." Another one of Cinna's outfits for the Victory tour includes a white coat, leather gloves, a bright red scarf, and earmuffs. The outfit Katniss wears in District 11 is described as "a pretty orange frock patterned with autumn leaves." Cinna designs dresses for Katniss to wear to banquets and balls. One is described by Katniss as pale pink and strapless. Another is described by Johanna Mason as a dark blue velvet number. The dress worn by Annie Cresta at her wedding was designed by Cinna for Katniss in District 5. After Katniss accepted Peeta's proposal during the Victory Tour stop at the Capitol, Cinna designed a set of wedding dresses. The Capitol audience voted on the finalists to select the one that would have been used for the wedding. Katniss describes the winner as having sleeves that touch the floor and lots and lots of pearls. During the third quarter quell she wore a fitted blue jumpsuit only 1/2 inch thick made of sheer material, zipper in front, six-inch wide padded belt covered in purple plastic, and nylon shoes with rubber soles. Every victor wore a blue jumpsuit, and a belt that was also a flotation device. The belt was filled with a thick, purple, liquid. Katniss also wore her Mockingjay pin.

In Mockingjay, she wore a plain grey shirt and pants since all residents of District 13 wear this. Cinna had designed a uniform for Katniss to wear for her role as the mockingjay. The uniform was black body armor. It had a helmet that can turn into a hood, a chest plate to protect vital organs and had special reinforcements over her heart, short sleeves that reach to her elbows, and white folds under her arms. She had hidden weapons in her boots and belt. Katniss wears a bloody bandage to cover the scar on her left arm that Johanna Mason gave her when she cut her tracker out during the 75th Hunger Games. She also wears her Mockingjay pin over her heart. It's also said in the book after the explosion in Capitol where her sister died, that some of her hair was burned off. Her Mockingjay suit is red, symbolizing the rebellion and the revolution.

Personality
 Katniss has strong and independent survivalist instincts due to her difficult past and is good at thinking outside the box. She is not socially adept and has a hard time making friends due to the emotional strain on her life which has made her hard and cold. She is more concerned about feeding her family than being social, making her awkward around people. Though Katniss can be rather blunt, misanthropic, sarcastic, bitingly cynical, and cold, she has a very vulnerable side which she only shows around her family, and she has a natural maternal instinct as showed when she comforted Prim and helped Rue. She is not very good at acting for the camera and comes across best when she is herself. She is usually very logical except for times when her emotions get in the way.

Katniss has a habit of biting her nails when she is nervous or anxious and must consciously stop herself from doing so when around others. After she became a victor she could not think of a good reason to break the habit. However, after joining the rebellion she appears to have stopped biting her nails as she does not mention doing so.

Katniss is very strong, stubborn, and determined. Often, she will react first and ask questions later. She will do anything to survive. Even when she allied with Rue, she said she hoped that she didn't have to be the one to kill her. Yet when it came to Peeta, she tried her best to figure a way for them both to survive. This independent streak did not go well in the regimented confines of District 13 and Katniss largely did what she wanted and ignored her daily schedule. She had to discipline herself to undergo military training in order to prove that she could be sent into combat, and her unwillingness to take orders was perceived as her greatest weakness. This was targeted during her individual exam, but she was able to realize this and pass.

Even though she can sometimes be a bit self-centered and self-reliant, she does have noble traits, protecting those she loves. For example, caring for Prim, looking out for Rue, and ending Cato's life mercifully even though he caused her so much pain or when she shields Gale to keep him from being whipped, even when it means a lash for herself. Katniss has an instinct to protect those who are weak such as Rue, Wiress, and her prep team.

Unlike her younger sister, she is not a natural born healer. She once ran from the house in fright while Prim and her mother cared for a dying man. She even had trouble healing Peeta, being squeamish, and reluctant to care for him unclothed. Instead, she is more like her father, being skilled at hunting and gathering.

Similar to her father, Katniss had a rebellious streak. She was a fiercely determined and resourceful fighter and was reasonably easy to underestimate. Due to this, she was almost always in disagreement with authority figures and liked to use her own resources when it came to survival (the instincts of a true survivor). Katniss was loyal to no one and had issues when it came to trusting others, but this grew to be her one of her greatest strengths.

In Mockingjay, it is shown that Katniss dislikes being a "pawn" and hates having the weight of Panem on her shoulders.

Katniss suffers from PTSD from her experiences in the Hunger Games throughout the series. This includes frequent nightmares and night terrors of those she killed and tried to kill her, avoidance of others/isolation, irritability, and favoring the wilds of the forest over human contact. 

Abilities
Katniss hunting in the District 12 Woods
Master Marksman: Katniss is a highly skilled archer and hunter, which she learned from her father. She could draw an arrow and strike several targets with a good amount of speed and flexibility due to her good reflexes. She uses her reflexes several times throughout the trilogy: When escaping the Cornucopia bloodbath in the 74th Hunger Games, evading fireballs when the Gamemakers create a forest inferno to draw the tributes together, when she ran from the wolf mutts, fighting Cato atop the Cornucopia, escaping the monkey mutts during the third Quarter Quell and then diverting her aim at the end of the book to assassinate President Coin. Later in District 13, she belatedly undergoes military training in order to participate in the fighting against the Capitol and gains enough proficiency with a gun to be selected for a sharpshooter unit, Squad 451. In pre-judging, she scored the highest mark out of all tributes which was an 11. In the second movie, she demonstrated exceptional lethality during her combat simulation, which all the other tributes watched in awe.
Knife Proficiency: She has some experience with wielding and throwing a knife in order to finish off a wounded prey animal. During practice sessions, she found that she was also a reasonably good spear-thrower, indicating she has skill with most- if not all- projectile weapons.
Skilled Combatant: Before the third quarter quell, Peeta trains Katniss hand to hand combat skills, making her an exceptional opponent. She is also trained further while living in District 13.     Katniss at the snares station.
