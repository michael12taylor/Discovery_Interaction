Biography
Early life
Katniss's father was a miner and illegal hunter who traded on the black market in District 12. Her mother is a healer, the daughter of the town Apothecary owners. Katniss's younger sister is Primrose, who is four years younger than she is.

When Katniss was a child her father would bring her out into the woods beyond District 12 to teach her how to hunt with a bow and arrow, as well as how to forage for edible plants. He would sometimes bring her to a lake far into the woods where she learned how to swim. It was on one of these lake visits that Mr. Everdeen introduced Katniss to the edible plant she was named after, and told her, "As long as you can find yourself, you'll never starve."

Katniss was close to her father as a child and shared his appreciation for music. He was a good singer, so good that the mockingjays in the woods would stop to listen to him and copy his tunes. At some point, he taught her a song called "The Hanging Tree", a song about a man calling for his lover to meet him in death. When Katniss's mother heard her singing it, she began screaming at her father, telling him that it was dangerous and unsuitable to be heard by small children and could influence them. This was heightened when she saw Katniss and Prim make actual 'necklaces of rope', with the sisters being oblivious to the fact that the song was talking about voluntarily hanging themselves to death. She then banned the song from their home and forbade Katniss to sing it again outside. Although Katniss never sang it in her mothers presence again, she later sang it during the rebellion when she thought of her father. (In the book Mockingjay, where the lyrics are revealed)

When Katniss was 11, her father died in a mining accident, causing her mother to fall into a deep depression and sadness. She became still and weak, refusing to listen to her daughters and becoming jobless. Unable to stir her mother from her bed, Katniss became the head and primary breadwinner of the family. In order to be resourceful, Katniss made their rations last as long as possible. When they ran out she attempted to sell some old clothes to make some money, to no avail. She tried to look in the garbage bins of the houses in the town square but was rebuked by the baker's wife for snooping. Peeta Mellark, the baker's son, gave Katniss some burnt bread that he'd been told to give to the pig. It is implied that Peeta burnt the bread specifically so he could give it to Katniss to save her life.

Katniss begins to remember the knowledge her father taught her about the woods and about feeding herself. As she gains the courage to move deeper into the forest, she finds more game and is better able to feed her family. Katniss's mother begins to come back out of her depression, but Katniss can no longer trust her or rely on her. When she turned 12, Katniss signed up for Tesserae, causing her name to be entered four times in her first reaping. Despite this, Katniss is not chosen as tribute.

In the woods, Katniss meets Gale Hawthorne, an older boy whose father died in the same mining accident that killed her father. Gale has provided for his family by setting traps and snares to catch game. The two eventually become a team and Katniss provides Gale with one of the bows her father made; she teaches him how to shoot and he teaches her about snares. Katniss is not very interested in politics but Gale is a political radical who dreams of an uprising against the oppressive Capitol. Katniss lets him vent to her but is otherwise unmoved. The two agree to protect each other's families if one of them is reaped.

Katniss, like all children in Panem, is required to attend school except on certain holidays, including the Reaping. Unsure of her social skills and uninterested in making friends, Katniss's only school friend is Madge Undersee, though Katniss feels they are more like acquaintances than friends as they rarely talk and mostly just sit together at mealtimes and in classes. It is clear that Madge thinks well of Katniss and cares about her safety.

74th Hunger Games

The Mockingjay Pin
In the book, Madge Undersee gave Katniss the pin during their final goodbyes. Madge asked her to use the pin as her District token for the hunger games.

In the movie, Katniss goes to the black market, The Hob, and some old lady (Greasy Sae) gave her the pin for free. Before the reaping, Katniss gave the pin to Prim, to help her feel safer. During the final goodbyes, Prim gives the pin back to Katniss.

The Reaping
When she was 16 years old, Katniss volunteered to take her sister, Primrose Everdeen's place in the 74th Hunger Games after Prim's name was called during the reaping. Originally, she had no intention of going into the games, hoping she wouldn't be picked before the female tribute was chosen. It had not even crossed her mind, but, when her sister was picked, she volunteered to save her, in hopes that she could actually win. In the book and film, Prim was actually worried about being picked, but Katniss thought that was impossible since she hadn't taken any tesserae and her name was only entered once. The impossible happened whether Prim had taken any or not. The male tribute was from the town bakery, Peeta Mellark, who had once risked a beating to save Katniss and her family from starvation by gifting them some burnt bread.

Before she leaves for the Capitol, Katniss goes to the Justice Building to say her final goodbyes to her mother, Gale, Prim, Madge Undersee, and Mr. Mellark. When she says goodbye to her mother and Prim, Prim makes her promise to try to win, so Katniss complies and tells her mother to make a promise that she won't leave Prim alone to take care of herself. Her mother tries to explain to Katniss that she was ill, but Katniss still makes her promise to take care of Prim, and she finally complies. Madge Undersee comes in to say her final goodbye to her by giving her the mockingjay pin. The baker, Peeta's father, comes in and gives her cookies, a luxury, and tells her he will not let her family starve. Gale tries to give her a final piece of advice but is dragged out before he can finish, leaving Katniss to wonder about the thing Gale wanted to say so badly. The district escort, Effie Trinket, then takes Peeta and Katniss aboard the train to The Capitol. On their way, Katniss and Peeta meet their drunken mentor, Haymitch Abernathy.

The Parade
When Katniss arrives at the Capitol, she gets prepared for the parade through the city streets. She is fussed over by her prep team, which consists of Octavia, Flavius and Venia. She then meets her stylist, Cinna, who comes up with an idea that would amaze all of Panem and make Katniss and Peeta unforgettable. Cinna dresses her up in a black unitard to represent coal and lights her and Peeta with synthetic fire that does not burn them. After the parade, they are escorted to their residence. At dinner time, Katniss meets a haunting face from the past, a girl who she didn't get to save, who has now become an Avox.

Training Sessions
The next morning, Katniss goes down to the Training Center to prepare for the games. Haymitch advises her not to show her all of her skills until the private sessions with the Gamemakers. During training, Katniss and Peeta notice they are being followed by a little girl named Rue, from District 11.

During the private session, Katniss shows the Gamemakers her skills with a bow and arrow. Katniss shoots at the practice dummy but misses. She is angered because the first shot went wrong as she was not accustomed to the bow she was using. The Gamemakers start ignoring her and pay more attention to a roast pig since she is from District 12, a district that is not known for producing many victors. Along with that, she was the last person who got to show their skills. Out of frustration, Katniss targets the apple in the roasted pig's mouth, successfully hitting it, causing reactions of shock and amazement among the Gamemakers. Katniss is, at first, outraged at her own behavior, later thinking she shouldn't have shot the pig, crying in her bed. However, Katniss scores an 11 for her fiery temper and attitude, and is surprised later on.

Interviews
While preparing for interview night, Katniss is stressed out by Haymitch and Effie trying to prepare her. Cinna dresses her in a dress covered in jewels that make her look like she is being engulfed by flames whenever she moves. He gives her advice before she does her interview, being the only one she truly likes and respects. She is interviewed by Caesar Flickerman and she talks about her stay in the Capitol. She becomes something of a celebrity in Panem and is given the advantage of sympathy after Peeta admits to all of Panem that he loves her, making Katniss blush at first, then get extremely angry and shoving Peeta before calming down and apologizing.

Into the arena

The night before the Games, she is terrified of the horrors that await her in the arena. She goes to the rooftop and talks with Peeta. Peeta tells her that he wants to die as himself and show that he is more than just a piece in the Capitol's Games. Katniss is enraged and leaves when he doubts he will win.

On the day of the Games, Cinna dresses Katniss in her uniform for the games. While waiting to launch, Katniss and Cinna talk to each other. He tells Katniss that he can't bet on any tributes due to his part in the preparation of the Games, but if he could, he would bet on her. Katniss finds some confidence in this and the speaker announces the tributes to launch.

Cornucopia Bloodbath
When the Games begin, Katniss gets away from the Cornucopia quickly, trying to follow the advice of her mentor, but getting into a minor tussle with the District 9 male over an orange backpack which ends when the boy is cleaved in the back by Clove, the girl from District 2. The backpack contains a sleeping bag, a bottle of iodine along with a dropper (a chemical that purifies water), a water bottle, crackers, dried beef strips, wire, and a pair of night glasses that she first mistakes for sunglasses.

Katniss is almost killed in the bloodbath when Clove aims a knife at her head. She blocks it with her backpack and earns a knife as a result. Clove does not pursue her, and she heads back to the Cornucopia before all the good stuff is taken. Katniss runs into Foxface in the forest and they part ways in a panic. She also has a brief encounter with the District 10 Male, but runs in the opposite direction and he does not pursue her. Over the next few days, Katniss moves further and further away from the Cornucopia, though she is slowed down by dehydration. She nearly dies of thirst before she finds a small pond to drink from, stumbling onto it while she camouflages her bright orange backpack with mud so that it wouldn't draw too much attention.

Hunted by the Career Tributes
The next morning, she is awoken by a forest fire created by the Gamemakers, including fireballs that are flung at her. She survives the attack but suffers minor burns and cuts on her hands and a severe burn on her calf. She goes to sleep and is woken by the sound of footsteps. Katniss is briefly chased by the Career pack, consisting of Glimmer, Marvel, Cato, Clove, the female from District 4 (book), and Peeta, and escapes up a tree. Cato tries to climb up after Katniss, but crashes to the ground because he is too heavy for the branches to hold. Glimmer also attempts to kill Katniss by shooting her with an arrow (film), but she misses. The Careers realize that they are all too heavy to climb the tree, so they decide to wait for her to come down.

Alliance with Rue
Suddenly, Rue appears high up in a neighboring tree and points to the tracker jacker nest above Katniss, showing her what to do with it.

The next morning before Katniss does anything, she warns Rue she is about to cut the nest down. Katniss cuts it down with the knife she got from Clove and the tracker jackers attack the Careers, killing Glimmer and the girl tribute from District 4 (book). The Careers run to the lake after being stung by the tracker jackers. Katniss is also stung and starts to run in the other direction. Katniss remembers that Glimmer had a silver bow when the Careers attacked her (the only bow in the entire arena), so she goes back for it. She retrieves it from Glimmer's bloated body, but as she's about to run away, her hallucinations start occurring. A delusional Katniss is saved by Peeta when she's unable to coordinate herself to run from Cato, who is quickly approaching. After she runs away, she blacks out from the tracker jacker venom.

Katniss alliance with Rue.
When Katniss wakes up, she finds out that she's being watched by Rue, the female tribute from District 11. She then proposes an alliance with Rue. She says Rue reminds her of Prim, in both size and demeanor. She tries to give Rue her pin, but Rue says no, saying that that was how she came to trust Katniss in the first place, seeing the mockingjay on her pin. Katniss and Rue then plan to destroy the Careers' food and supply pile, with Katniss figuring that the Careers have had plenty of food their whole lives and that they would struggle if a direct food supply was taken away from them. Rue provides a distraction while Katniss checks out the Career camp. She discovers that the food is protected by landmines (with the help of Foxface, the District 5 tribute), and shoots a sack that spills apples onto the ground, setting off all of the landmines. Nearly everything is destroyed and due to the explosion and her relative proximity, Katniss becomes deaf in her left ear, though this injury is later surgically repaired after the games.

Death of Rue

Katniss goes to the woods, listening for Rue. Her four note melody rings out through the woods from Mockingjays, but she suddenly cries out for Katniss. Katniss runs through the trees to find Rue entangled in a mesh net, one arm sticking out before a spear is thrown into her abdomen by the boy from District 1, whose name is later revealed to be Marvel. Katniss shoots an arrow at Marvel's neck, killing him. Katniss then goes over to comfort Rue, Katniss promises she'll win for the both of them and sings the valley song, ‘Deep in the Meadow’, that she sang to comfort Prim the morning of the reaping. 
Katniss giving the silent salute in the arena.
Rue dies after Katniss finishes the song. Seeing Rue dead angers her because of the fact that the Capitol enjoys watching innocent children die. To make Rue an example, Katniss picks white flowers and decorates Rue's body with them, hiding the wound and weaving them into her hair. When she finishes, Katniss realizes how peaceful Rue looks and does the signature District 12 farewell gesture to Rue. Later, this is seen as an act of defiance to the Capitol. She then takes Rue and Marvel's backpacks, knowing that she would have wanted Katniss to have them.

Locating Peeta
By the time of the announcement that two tributes from the same district can win, Katniss's left ear is completely deafened. She cries out for Peeta, but then suddenly regrets it, realizing the potential danger. She seeks out Peeta and finds him hiding in the mud of a riverbank, totally camouflaged. He's suffering from a severe cut on his leg that Cato gave him, tracker jacker stings, and multiple burns. She washes him off at the river, treats the burns and stings, but cannot do anything for his leg but stuff leaves into it, drawing out infection and pus. Katniss does everything she can to care for him, but he eventually gets blood poisoning. Once Katniss and Peeta hear the news about the Feast Peeta makes Katniss promise that she will not risk her life for him saying that he wouldn't be doing him a favor either.

The Feast
Katniss kisses Peeta in the cave to gain the support of sponsors
A feast is then announced by the Gamemakers near the Cornucopia, where Katniss will find the item she needs most, as do all of the other tributes as well: the medicine needed to cure Peeta's blood poisoning. Katniss, knowing that going to the feast will be dangerous, insists on going, though Peeta refuses to let her. Immediately afterward, Katniss receives sleeping syrup from their sponsors and tricks Peeta into consuming it by mixing the sleep syrup with berries, telling him it's "sugar berries." Precisely after eating the berries, he passes out for 24 hours, giving Katniss enough time to go to the feast and get the medicine for his leg.

The feast resulted in a fight between Katniss and Clove. First, Katniss's forehead gets cut by a knife that Clove threw at her. Then, they fight, but Clove gets the upper hand and is able to pin Katniss flat to the ground (due to her weight being much heavier than Katniss). She taunts Katniss about Rue's death and Peeta's predicament. Clove tells her that Cato let her "have Katniss," but made her promise to give the audience a "good show". Just as she is about to make the first cut at Katniss' lip, Clove is hurled away from her by Thresh, the boy from Rue's district, who slams a large rock into her head after accusing her of "cutting up" Rue. Katniss is surely afraid of what Thresh will do to her, but because of her alliance with Rue, he allows her to escape. He does not want to owe Katniss anymore and states that they are now even. She flees the feast with her life, and returns to the cave to heal both Peeta and her own wounds.

While they are both recovering, they see that Thresh has been presumably killed at the hands of Cato. During one night of rain, Katniss asks Peeta when he started loving her. Peeta tells her it was their first day of school when he heard Katniss sing the Valley Song. After the storm ended, the two went hunting. When Katniss whistled for Peeta and he did not answer, she ran towards him and the two argue for a bit until a cannon fires. Peeta had gathered deadly nightlock berries, that he didn't know were poisonous. Katniss expects Peeta to die, but it appears he hasn't eaten any yet. They see the body of the girl from District 5, whom Katniss nicknamed "Foxface", being taken away. A few days later, the river is found empty, as well as the ponds. They figure out that the Gamemakers want them to go to the lake.

The Death of Cato

When they make it there, they wait a few hours for Cato, the only other remaining tribute, to arrive. They are almost going to give up when he runs towards them. When Katniss sees that he is running away from a pack of wolf muttations, she and Peeta immediately ran away with him toward the Cornucopia. They reach the Cornucopia and scale it, though one of the mutts manages to injure Peeta. Once at the top of the horn, Cato finally gets back to his senses and fights Katniss. He overpowers the duo and strangles Peeta to the edge. In a last effort, Peeta draws an X in blood on the back of Cato's hand, telling Katniss to shoot there. Katniss shoots Cato on the back of his hand and he releases Peeta. Peeta then pushes him off so he wouldn't attack them again. Cato is later disarmed by the mutts and gnawed at, being left to suffer. After some time, Katniss decides to kill him out of pity, not vengeance. It is then announced that the rule of two tributes winning if they are from the same district has been revoked and so she and Peeta must fight to the death.

Victory
They pitifully realize that the former was just a ruse. Katniss aims her bow at Peeta when she sees he has picked up a weapon, but immediately drops it when he proceeds to throw it into the lake. Feeling guilty, she then takes out some of the nightlock berries and gives a handful to Peeta, and the two of them threaten to commit double suicide so there will be no winner.


They later discover the Capitol sees this as an act of rebellion. The plan works and both her and Peeta are crowned victors of the 74th Hunger Games. 
Katniss is crowned victor.
After their final interviews and dinner, they board a train that takes them home. Katniss is confused about her feelings for Peeta and becomes even more confused the closer they get to home.

The Aftermath
Victor's Village
In Catching Fire, Katniss is back in District 12 living in the Victors' Village with her mother, Prim, and Buttercup, and neighbors Peeta and Haymitch. Soon, she and Peeta will have to leave again for the Victory Tour where the winners of the previous Hunger Games travel to each district and make various appearances and public speeches. During much of the day, Katniss is bored with her new life, because now she has everything: money, a good home, and a constant supply of food. One day after Katniss returns

Katniss' conversation with President Snow.
home from hunting game outside of the district, she is visited by President Snow, the president of Panem. He explains to Katniss that during the last Hunger Games when she tried to commit double suicide with Peeta by eating poisonous nightlock, she ignited a possible uprising in the districts. President Snow and Katniss have a lengthy conversation about the fact that if she doesn't convince the districts that she made the decision out of temporary lovesickness, then he will personally make sure she suffers.


Katniss, now convinced she has started a fire she cannot control, tries her best to convince everyone that she and Peeta are madly in love. When she and Peeta finally set off for the Victory Tour, everything is going smoothly and Peeta has agreed with Katniss that outside of being star-crossed lovers, they should try to be friends. When the tour arrives at their first destination, District 11, Katniss tells everyone the story of how Thresh spared her life, and how Rue became a

 valued ally during the Games. After her speech, an old man whistles her and Rue's four-note tune that meant they were safe, and that signals the end of the workday in District 11, the crowd simultaneously does a traditional District 12 gesture to show their thanks to Katniss. Soon after Katniss finishes her speech, a Peacekeeper shoots the man who whistled in the head, along with two others.

Near the end of the Tour, they visit the Capitol and when she and Peeta are being interviewed by Caesar, Peeta performs a fake proposal to Katniss, which she accepts. President Snow makes a surprise visit to congratulate Katniss and Peeta. He motions to Katniss that she was unsuccessful in convincing their love. President Snow decides to hold their wedding in the Capitol. There is a party held in the banquet room of his mansion. Katniss there learns that in order to taste each and every dish the people of Capitol drink a clear liquid which causes them to vomit and empty their stomachs in order to continue eating and do this again and again. This disturbs her since she had seen her mother treating emaciated children whose parents didn't have anything to afford for them, not even their medicine, and she was also poor before winning the games and had almost starved to death once. She is introduced to Plutarch Heavensbee, the new Head Gamemaker by Portia. They then travel to District 12. Katniss suffers from nightmares throughout the night on the train, so Peeta sleeps in her bed to calm her and keeps her company. Finally, they get back to District 12 and a huge party is thrown for them at Mayor Undersee's house. While in the mayor's home, Katniss sees on his television that there is an uprising going on in District 8. Katniss arranges a secret meeting with Gale, during which he confesses his love for her. Gale gets angry and disappointed but before he leaves, Katniss accidentally tells him there was a rebellion in District 8. Gale then says that they could have a rebellion in District 12 as well, and he runs off to spread the news.

Gale's Whipping
Katniss then goes to Peeta to ask him if he would run away with her and he agrees to go with her, but while they are discussing the plans, they see that Gale is being violently whipped in the square by an unfamiliar man.

Katniss steps in to stop the man, whose name is Romulus Thread, the Head Peacekeeper but he gives her a lash across the face. Katniss gets severely hurt. Eventually, the people of District 12, including many who frequent the Hob, convince Thread to stop whipping Gale. Haymitch steps in and holds her up and shouts at Romulus since she has a photo-shoot next week. In the movie, Haymitch and Peeta step in to save her.

Purnia, a female commoner, steps in, saying the proper amount of lashes has been given. Romulus warns all of them and leaves with the Peacekeepers including Darius, a male Peacekeeper who had been hit on the head by Thread and was lying unconscious. They manage to pick up Gale on a countertop provided by an old woman in her clothing stall. Katniss tells Leevy, a former neighbor, to call Hazelle, Gale's mother. Bristel and Thorn, Gale's crewmembers from the mine told everyone the situation. Gale had killed a wild turkey and went to Cray, the previous Head Peacekeeper to bid for it. Cray was lenient, alcoholic, and overlooked such crimes. But he was replaced by Romulus Thread and Gale didn't have any idea about it. Expecting Cray to pay him, he went to his house and found Thread there. Gale could not say much in his defense and was punished with whiplashes.

Darius, a Peacekeeper who was unconscious had stepped in first after 20 lashes saying that it was enough but didn't do it as smartly and officially as Purnia did and grabbed Thread's arm. In return, Thread hit him on his head with the butt of the whip forming a large purple lump on his head, making him unconscious.

Gale received forty lashes until Katniss showed up and he passed out at around thirty. Katniss and the others take Gale to her mother. Katniss's mother tries to soothe the pain by giving him medicine. Hazelle also comes there and sits beside her son. Madge brings her mother's box of vials containing Morphling, a kind of medicine. Mrs. Everdeen injects it into Gale. Later on that night, Katniss says she picks Gale but is still torn between him and Peeta.
Katniss has a nightmare in which Clove turns into a mutt. She wakes up with a start, shivering. 
The conditions in District 12 worsen. People are punished for their crimes, mines are shut down for two weeks, etc.

Bonnie and Twill
Katniss realizes that she cannot stand to be at home, so she goes into the woods and heads to the lake. There, she meets two women named Bonnie and Twill who have run away from District 8. They say things like they are headed to District 13 since they believe that the district was not actually destroyed and there are people living there underground, the uprising in District 8 was a planned one. Their evidence was the fact that the Capitol always shows the same footage of a destroyed and demolished District 13 from 75 years ago, she realizes that what they said was the truth.

Katniss teaches them the essentials of surviving in a forest and gives them food to eat. When the evening comes, they leave and Katniss returns to District 12. However, she realizes that the fence to the district is now electrified and so she must climb a tree and jump from 25 feet in the air. She lands and hurts her tailbone and heel. She returns home to tell her mother how she fell after slipping on a patch of ice, but there are two Peacekeepers there waiting for her. They are surprised to see her because they knew she was in the forest and believed she would be trapped on the other side of the fence. They were waiting for her not to show up so they can bring her family in for questioning. Luckily, Haymitch, Peeta, and Prim were able to go along with a story to cover for her.

The Third Quarter Quell
Preparation
Once she is healed, her prep team comes to help with her wedding fashion shoot, along with Cinna. She listens to them speak of how they have not had shrimp in the Capitol for weeks and realizes that other districts are rebelling. The next night, there is a view of the photo-shoot and a voting on which was the best dress and later there is an important announcement made by President Snow: in honor of the third Quarter Quell, for the 75th Hunger Games the tributes will be reaped from the existing pool of victors. Since District 12 has only three living winners, Peeta, Haymitch, and Katniss, and being the only female victor, she knows that she is now going to be forced to go back into the arena.
She runs out of the house and into a basement of an empty one to scream, cry, and proceeds to shatter a window of the kitchen. This makes her hand bleed. She makes her way to Haymitch, where he already tells her Peeta has come to visit him, and told him that Peeta wants to go back into the arena to protect Katniss. She tells Haymitch that whatever they do, she wants Haymitch to make sure Peeta comes back alive. She and Haymitch get drunk. She returns in an inebriated state to her house and sees Gale at the doorway and Katniss passes out in his arms. She has a horrible hangover the next day and in the afternoon, she goes back to Haymitch's house, where Peeta has emptied all of his liquor and has threatened to turn them or anyone who gives them alcohol in. He tells them that they will be training for the Quarter Quell because two people will come back alive, and they begin to work out and study footage of past winners to see their competition.

The Reaping

On the day of the reaping, Katniss is the only choice for the female competitor, and the chosen male competitor is Haymitch. Peeta, however, volunteers to take his place. Instead of being able to tell their families goodbye, they are brought directly to the train and leave for the Capitol.

Training Sessions
Once at the Capitol, they eat and meet their competitors. During training, Katniss befriends Wiress and Beetee Latier from District 3, who point out the force field used to separate the Gamemakers from the tributes. In her solo performance for the Gamemakers, Katniss sees Plutarch Heavensbee, the new Head Gamemaker, and decides to tie a noose around a dummy's neck. With berry juice, she writes the name "Seneca Crane," the former Head Gamemaker who was hanged by orders of President Snow. She and Peeta both receive perfect 12s, which Haymitch explains was done to make sure the other tributes are gunning for both of them.

Interviews
Katniss in her mockingjay outfit.
On the day of the interview, the prep team comes into Katniss' room and they start to cry; they leave one by one. Then, only Venia is left. She does the job of the whole team. At last, Cinna comes in with her wedding gown from the photoshoot, specifically chosen by President Snow. She notes to Cinna that it's heavier than before, but he explains that he had to do some alterations and tells her not to lift her arms until she twirls on television. The interview atmosphere is different from the previous year. The tributes are speaking out against the Capitol, asking why President Snow is not stopping this if he is great and powerful. When Katniss comes on stage with the dress on, apologizing to the crowd for not letting them see her get married. She twirls and raises her arms and the wedding dress burns away to reveal a different dress underneath. When she looks towards a television, she realizes that Cinna has turned her into a mockingjay.

Although Caesar knows what the dress represents, they play it off as the bird on Katniss' token. When it comes to Peeta's turn to speak, he lies and tells the audience that he and Katniss are already married and that Katniss is pregnant. This drives the audience to madness and hysteria.

Cornucopia bloodbath
Katniss in the arena.
Right before the Games are to begin, Katniss is with Cinna and steps on the plate to be taken to the arena, where she is frozen in place. Suddenly three Peacekeepers enter the room, beat Cinna, and drag him out of the room. A frozen Katniss watches in horror but is then transported into the arena. In Mockingjay, it is revealed that Cinna was actually killed as a result of his injuries. The plate leaves her in the middle of blue water, which she realizes "is no place for a girl on fire." While retrieving a bow and arrows, she sees that Finnick is wearing a gold bracelet that once belonged to Haymitch and realizes that this was his way of telling her to form an alliance with Finnick. She and Peeta run into the jungle with Finnick, who carries his 80-year-old district partner, Mags.

Saving Peeta
As they are walking, searching for drinkable water, Katniss notices a shimmering square and realizes that it is a force field surrounding the arena. Before she can stop him, Peeta walks into it and is repelled back, knocking Mags and Finnick to the ground. Peeta is not breathing. Panicked, Katniss begins to slap him but his heart has stopped. Finnick helps by performing CPR and Peeta is eventually resuscitated. Finnick asks Katniss how she recognized the force field. She does not want to let them know she can spot them visually, worried that the Gamemakers might do something to retaliate, so she tells them she heard it with her repaired ear.

Escaping the Fog
Later that day she notices an unnatural, and poisonous fog in the distance. The mist from the fog causes blisters where it touches. When Peeta stumbles, she notices it also attacks the nerves, as his face droops and his legs stop working. Finnick agrees to carry Peeta if Katniss can carry Mags, which she agrees to. But after a while, Katniss cannot carry Mags anymore as her legs become paralyzed. Finnick comes back and tells Katniss he cannot carry them both. Mags kisses Finnick and runs into the fog, convulsing and dying. Over time, Katniss, Peeta, and Finnick help each other as they meet different challenges in the arena.

Alliance with Johanna, Wiress, and Beetee
Later, they meet Johanna Mason, whom Finnick runs to, and they hug. As Katniss and Peeta figure out what to do, they realize they cannot leave Finnick after all he has done, and go to Johanna instead. She has Wiress and Beetee with her. Beetee has received a knife in the back, while Wiress is spinning in a circle saying "Tick tock, tick tock," repeatedly. Johanna explains that Haymitch told her to bring them to Katniss for an alliance. Later that night, when Wiress restates "tick tock," Katniss begins to realize the arena is in the shape of a clock. She also remembers Plutarch Heavensbee showing her his clock watch and saying, "It begins at midnight," as an image of a mockingjay flashed on the watch face.

They go to the Cornucopia to see if they are correct and are proven to be right. While drawing up the map of the clock, Katniss realizes that Wiress has stopped singing because Gloss slit her throat, and turns with an arrow ready and hits Gloss in the temple, while Johanna buries an axe in Cashmere's chest. Katniss starts to realize that everyone is protecting Peeta and wonders if they believe that he can be the leader of the rebellion.

Later, Peeta tries to give Katniss a gold locket and tells her he wants her to win, because if she dies he has nothing to live for. They kiss, and she realizes that she loves Peeta and wants to fulfill her plan of keeping him alive.

Beetee's Plan
The next day, after telling Peeta that they need to leave the alliance, he tells her to wait because he believes Beetee has a plan. The plan is to tie Beetee's wire around a tree that is struck by lightning and run the wire into the ocean, making the beach a conductor to electrocute everything in its path. Katniss and Johanna are in charge of running the wire down to the beach because they are the fastest, however, they are attacked by Brutus and Enobaria of District 2. Katniss is knocked in the head and through her blurred vision sees Johanna on top of her stabbing her arm, and telling her to stay down.

Katniss hears Finnick running but stays quiet so as not to alert him to her whereabouts, since she believes that he and Johanna have betrayed them. Realizing that Beetee was trying to blow up the forcefield, she wraps his wire around her bow and shoots it straight into the flaw in the forcefield at the exact moment when the lightning strikes the tree, blowing up the arena. After she is carried out of the arena and transported into a hovercraft, she lays there realizing that the Capitol will not let anyone live after this, and sees Plutarch Heavensbee coming over to her as she passes out.

The Aftermath
District 13
She awakes in a hospital bed next to Beetee. She searches for Peeta, believing that the Capitol has captured them, and planning to kill Peeta to save him from being tortured. She blames Haymitch because he promised that he would save Peeta instead of her.

She passes a room and hears Plutarch talking to Finnick and Haymitch about getting someone out of District 4. She enters the room and Haymitch tells her that there was a plan to break them out the minute the Quell was announced. The victors from districts 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 11 had varying degrees of knowledge about it. Plutarch had been for several years part of a group planning to overthrow the Capitol. The hovercraft they are in is from District 13, which is where they are headed. She tells them that Johanna tried to kill her, but Finnick explains that she was removing Katniss' tracker, and that all of the victor tributes in those districts have pledged their lives to her and the rebellion; that she is the Mockingjay, the symbol of the rebellion.

She realizes that Haymitch had lied to both her and Peeta. He tells her that everyone kept Peeta alive because they knew that if he died she would never keep an alliance with the others. She asks where Peeta is, and Haymitch tells her he was picked up, along with Johanna and Enobaria, by the Capitol. In horror and anger, she attacks Haymitch, scratching his face. Finnick and others strap her down and drug her to keep her calm. Finnick tells her that the Capitol will at least keep Peeta alive to use as bait against Katniss.

Later, Gale visits her. He tells her that after the Games, the Capitol sent bombers to District 12. He explains that he was able to get her family out in time, but District 12 has been destroyed.

District 13 Rebellion
Visiting District 12

In Mockingjay, Katniss is in what's left of District 13 Underground. She goes to visit the ruins of District 12 after the firebombing from the Capitol. She finds that Buttercup (Prim's cat) somehow survived the destruction of District 12. She takes Buttercup and hides him in her hunting bag as a comforting present to Prim who is in District 13 with her mother and the other residents of District 12 that survived the bombing. While examining her old room, she finds a white rose that was left by President Snow as a sign meaning that he was watching her, possibly right then. 
Katniss in her home, District 12.
Becoming the Mockingjay
Katniss is stressed and overwhelmed by everything that is happening - District 13, wondering if Peeta is still alive, etc. --  but is glad she now has her old relationship with Gale. She gets used to life in District 13 and starts to like it -- but she sees District 13 as an underground prison with nowhere to go. Katniss watches Peeta's interview with Caesar Flickerman and is filled with joy that Peeta is still alive and healthy. She runs off to a supply closet and hides there alone until Gale enters. The two talk about the situation, and that is when she decides that she will be "the mockingjay," a symbol of the rebellion against the Capitol. As part of the deal, she demands that the leader of District 13, President Alma Coin, grant immunity to all of the victors of the Hunger Games. She demands the right to kill President Snow herself and asks for her family to keep their cat, Buttercup, and to hunt with Gale. After the meeting, Plutarch takes her and Gale downstairs where they are stopped by a guard due to a secret room. Gale makes a distraction, and Katniss rushes in and sees her prep team being held prisoner.

Katniss helps them recover by taking them to her mother for treatment. During the meeting held by President Coin for the announcement of her role and conditions, Katniss sees Finnick distracted and in grief. She calls for him but he doesn't answer. She shakes him to get his attention, and the two embrace each other. When Katniss is reminded of Annie, she tells Coin to pencil in Annie as one of the victors to receive immunity. Katniss is surprised by Coin's message during the meeting that, if she doesn't meet all of her obligations as the mockingjay, she and her friends and family are dead.

Skirmish in District 8

Katniss and Gale go hunting together like the old times, and they both enjoy it until they get in an argument over the fact that she cares for her prep team. Katniss leaves and is angry with Gale. She is being fixed by her prep team to make her look beautiful for the propo she will film as the mockingjay. When they finish, she and Gale go downstairs to the weapons room where Beetee is making weapons for the rebels. After she receives her weapons, she goes to the room where she will shoot her first propaganda, or propo. After she finishes, Haymitch goes on the speaker and tells them, "That is how you end a revolution." After a brief meeting, they decide to let Katniss speak for herself and to do it in action. Katniss suits up in her mockingjay uniform and heads to District 8 to shoot her first propaganda.
Katniss in the District 8 hospital.
During her visit, the hospital is attacked by the Capitol. The rebel forces fight back and are able to defeat them, but the hospital is destroyed. Katniss speaks her own words after the attack. After viewing the finished propaganda, she sees that it is strong. The group decides to shoot more and to send her back into combat as soon she feels up to it.

Katniss has dinner with Finnick in the hospital. Finnick comforts her, and they watch the propaganda again. Katniss tells him to shut the television off but stops him because Caesar is going to interview Peeta. She notes Peeta lost fifteen pounds and watches the interview. In the interview, Peeta asks Katniss why she joined the rebels, and if she didn't know, she should find out.

After watching it, she pretends to have not seen it because Plutarch walks in and makes sure she is well. She is overwhelmed by Peeta's interview. Katniss and Finnick go to the woods to hunt in District 13. Katniss talks about Peeta's broadcast from last night and questions why no one is talking about it. Katniss is thankful that Finnick is here to listen to her.

Katniss and Gale
The next day, Katniss and Gale have tension between them. Katniss is furious that Gale did not talk or say anything about Peeta's interview. Gale tells her it was to protect her and that he had to lie. Katniss, enraged by this, tells him to leave her alone and to stop lying to her. The next day, Katniss is informed she must go back to District 12 with Gale and the others to shoot more shots for the propaganda. Katniss goes to the remains of her home and feels pain inside of her. Katniss feels more pain when Gale asks to go to his house, but Cressida tells him to react to the night of the bombing.

Katniss goes and communicates with an Avox that escaped the Capitol, Pollux. She sings "The Hanging Tree" to him but is cut off by Cressida. Katniss begins to forgive Gale because the two must stay together. Katniss goes back to the Victor village and searches the area. Katniss and Gale kiss because they are both in pain, and the only way to escape it is by doing this.
