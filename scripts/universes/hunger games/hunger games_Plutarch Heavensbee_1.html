Biography
The Hunger Games
Plutarch is first seen in The Hunger Games, as an anonymous character. Katniss Everdeen is in her private session with the Gamemakers, and becomes angry when the Gamemakers are more interested in a roasted pig than her. When she shot her arrow at the apple in the roasted pig's mouth, Plutarch fell backward into a punch bowl, knocking it to the floor. During the interview, when Caesar Flickerman asks Katniss for details about her private training session, he jumps in saying that she can't reveal any details. After the end of the Games, Seneca Crane is executed, and Plutarch is appointed to be the new Head Gamemaker, citing that there were not many takers for the job.

Catching Fire
Plutarch with Haymitch
 

Plutarch is formally introduced in Catching Fire, during a feast after the 74th Victory Tour. He attempted to win Katniss's trust, but she dismissed his discreet hints of rebellion, he shows her his watch which in the right position you can see the symbol of the rebellion, the mockingjay. Katniss saw it and ponders what he means but she merely sees it as one of the Capitol's obnoxious trends. Later he shows up as Head Gamemaker and keeps his cover low. Plutarch shows no thought of Katniss in public and treats her like all other tributes. He is surprised when both Peeta and Katniss go in their private training session and they show signs of rebellion.

President Snow and Plutarch
It comes as a surprise to Katniss when Plutarch is revealed as a leader of the rebellion. Plutarch comes to the arena in a hovercraft and saves her, Finnick, and Beetee after a plan of his making removed the Capitol forcefield. He had already been involved in an undercover group for several years now that was aiming to overthrow the Capitol.

Mockingjay
Plutarch is a leader of the rebellion and appears during the meeting held by Katniss when she accepts the role of the Mockingjay. Plutarch is happy about her acceptance and that she hasn't changed. Plutarch wishes he could have some coffee and then takes both her and Gale downstairs, but they are stopped on their way by a guard. Gale makes a distraction which allows them to see the guarded room and finds Katniss' prep team being tortured. Plutarch is surprised by this and demands that they be freed.

Plutarch goes along with the others to District 8 to shoot their first propaganda. During their visit to one of the hospitals, the Capitol attacks them. Plutarch tries to keep Katniss safe by not allowing her to fight. Katniss does not accept this and goes to fight. After the propaganda is finished, Plutarch goes to receive medical treatment. They meet in the command room and discuss the propaganda and after they finish they decide to allow Katniss to go into combat again and film more after she is fully recovered.

Plutarch goes to Katniss's hospital room after Peeta's interview draws to an end because he is worried she is going crazy as a result of it. When he enters, Katniss and Finnick pretend not to have seen it. After Peeta's warning of the bombing on District 13 by the Capitol, Plutarch helps evacuate the entire district to safe bunkers. Plutarch is happy during the bombing because Beetee was successful in hacking the Capitol and airing Katniss' propaganda. Katniss does everything she can not to slap him. He informs Katniss and Prim of Peeta's condition and that he is receiving treatment for the injuries the Capitol has inflicted on him. Later, Katniss asks to go to the Capitol but he refuses because they need all the districts to be on their side first, but District 2 is still with the Capitol. Katniss tells him to send her to District 2.


Plutarch shows up later after she is shot in District 2 and is happy to finally have all the districts on their side. Plutarch explains further about the relationship between the Capitol and the districts. He announces that the next propo they will shoot will be of Finnick and Annie's wedding. Plutarch gives the order of shooting new propaganda in the Capitol. Plutarch also tells her to get ready for training so they can film it.


Plutarch was also believed by Snow to be part of the plan that killed Capitol children and rebel Casualty Aides including Prim. Katniss killed President Coin for her part in the plan, but seeks no vengeance against Plutarch. He does Katniss a favor by preventing the execution of Effie Trinket and acting as a witness in Katniss's defense at her trial for the murder of Coin.

Plutarch was appointed Secretary of Communications after the war.

Personality
Plutarch Heavensbee was a man with uncertain motives and ambitions. He was exceptionally intelligent and manipulative. He was even able to fool President Snow into thinking he was one of his most loyal allies, when in reality he worked for the rebellion. Plutarch saw the Hunger Games, and later the war against the Capitol, as giant chess games consisting of moves and countermoves. As such he was an ingenious strategist but this also caused him to be somewhat callous as he showed no concern for people who died in the Quarter Quell or the war. Plutarch was openly described by President Snow as 'brilliant'. He is also rather fond of coffee.

Work
Plutarch works as a Head Gamemaker, but is also a leader for the underground rebellion of District 13. He is only revealed to be part of the rebellion at the end of Catching Fire when he reveals that they are heading to District 13, a district believed to have been destroyed when the first rebellion took place. In District 13, he is head of propaganda and makes videos of Katniss as the Mockingjay.

Plutarch is given the job of Secretary of Communications by President Paylor at the end of Mockingjay, which means he is in charge of the programming on the airwaves.

Plutarch and his secretary, Fulvia, both survive the series.

Etymology
Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus, or just "Plutarch", was a famous historian and essayist in Ancient Rome. This ties in with the many Roman references and similarities of the series.

Trivia
In a deleted scene, it reveals that Plutarch was the one who switched the Quarter Quell to have the victors fight, not President Snow like Katniss thought.
The actor for Plutarch, Philip Seymour Hoffman, died on February 2, 2014 while shooting the last film (Mockingjay).
It is likely that he is a relative of Hilarius Heavensbee.</p></html>
