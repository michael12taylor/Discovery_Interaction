<html><p>Gifted Intellect: She is a very clever woman and a quick learner. She possessed the ability to quickly process multiple information streams and rapidly respond to changing tactical situations. After meeting Gale and learning from her, she added fishing and trapping to her skills. Also, she was making snares in the Training Center while watching the training of the career tributes including Cato using a sword, Glimmer using Bow and Arrows, and Marvel using and throwing spears, in order to analyse their abilities. She had to educate herself on the edible, medicinal, and poisonous plant life of District 12. Hunting and gathering on a daily basis have given her a highly skilled sense of woodcraft. Moreover, Katniss is a skilled tree-climber and a fast runner, which has benefited her in hunting and the Games.
Singer: She has a good singing voice, also inherited from her father, although she was reluctant to sing since his death.
Possessions

 Katniss had her hunting jacket and bow and arrows given by her father.
Katniss received a gold mockingjay pin, which was given to her by her friend, Madge Undersee. After she wins the Games, it becomes a symbol of rebellion for the districts against the Capitol, and a symbol of Katniss herself, as her actions were never meant to exist. However, many ignorant Capitol citizens

still use it as a symbol of fashion, as a remembrance of Katniss' exciting Games. Katniss also has a family plant book containing names of known plants which is an important possession. Katniss also receives from Peeta a pearl along with a gold locket engraved with a mockingjay, containing a picture of her mother, her sister Prim, and Gale during the Quarter Quell in Catching Fire. She is later seen throughout Mockingjay keeping the pearl close to her as a prized possession. In Mockingjay Katniss receives a bow and arrows from Beetee. They have mechanical properties and can be voice-activated.

Family
Katniss' only family is her sister Primrose Everdeen and her mother, Mrs. Everdeen. Her father died in a mine explosion. Katniss would do anything to protect Prim (short for Primrose), even if it means her own death. Her mother suffered extreme depression after the death of her husband, Katniss' father, leaving Katniss to become the head of the family, despite her young age. Mrs. Everdeen is a skilled healer, and Prim is something of an assistant.

Gale Hawthorne and his family are like family for her. In Catching Fire, it is revealed that during the Hunger Games, Gale was presented to the Capitol media as Katniss' cousin, in order to be interviewed about her without detracting from the romance which Katniss and Peeta were presenting to survive the arena. After the 74th Hunger Games conclude, President Snow threatens Katniss with Gale's life if she does not perpetuate this lie, and so she does. As part of this sham romance, Peeta and Katniss become engaged, and Peeta tells a TV interviewer that Katniss is pregnant. It is revealed early in Catching Fire that Gale loves Katniss. Even though her father is dead, she still misses him dearly. With the possible exception of Prim, there was no one Katniss loved more than her father. He taught her to hunt, swim, and live off the wild, skills that served her well during the games. Katniss inherits a beautiful singing voice from her father, shown when either of them sing the mockingjays stop to listen. He taught her many songs such as "The Hanging Tree" and the lullaby Katniss sang to Rue as she died. But after her father's death, singing reminds her too much of her father so she only does it rarely.

When Katniss's mom heard Katniss singing "The Hanging Tree" she yelled at him for teaching her that, and tells Katniss to forget the song. Katniss runs away to the hideout and of course, because she was told to forget the song, she distinctly remembers it. She remembers it a lot, especially after her father's death. Katniss sings the "Hanging Tree" once to Pollux when he wanted her to sing for the mockingjays and a few other times throughout the book Mockingjay. Katniss sings the Meadow Song to her two children, and many times throughout the series.

The rebellion drives Katniss's family apart. Prim's death in a bombing devastates Katniss. The trauma leaves her a "mental Avox," unable to speak until her encounter with Snow after his imprisonment. Her mother leaves District 12 permanently, taking a position in District 4 to build a hospital. Katniss returns home with Haymitch, where she finds that Peeta has also returned, yet Gale has not. Katniss and Peeta rely on each other while recuperating from the war, and rebuild their relationship.

Several years after the end of the rebellion (in the epilogue to Mockingjay) Katniss and Peeta start a family together. It is assumed they wed. Katniss mentions that Peeta wanted to complete their family with kids. Of their children, their first is a girl, who has black hair like her mother, and blue eyes like her father the second is a boy, with blond hair like his father, and grey eyes like his mother. Their daughter is older than her brother because her brother was still a toddler. Their daughter is old enough to understand that Peeta and Katniss played a role in the Hunger Games but their son is too young.

Etymology
The Katniss plant is also known as "arrowhead" and belongs to the genus Sagittaria. It is both ornamental and useful.

She was given two other names due to her symbolic role: The Girl on Fire and The Mockingjay. The first was a reference to her spectacular costume during the chariot ride before her first games and her dresses. The second was because of her district token, a gold mockingjay pin, which came to stand for the rebellion. Both names originated from something she wore.

Trivia
Katniss's birthday is May 8th. This is a special day in France for the celebration of Joan of Arc, to whom Katniss had been compared. However, Suzanne Collins has not yet indicated whether this was intentional or merely coincidence.
Katniss' promotional posters for the films are distinctively unique, albeit the fourth film's posters have unique posters for each character who has one.
In the first film, she's the only character who is facing and looking right.
In the second film, she's the only character standing, not sitting in her chair.
In the third film, each character has the film's mockingjay emblem behind them. Katniss also has it, but hers is aflame.
In the final film, her subtitle reads "Panem Unite."

Her favorite color is green and her favorite food in the Capitol is lamb stew with dried plums served on grain.
Of all the promotional character posters for the The Hunger Games, Katniss' is the only one facing right.
All the tributes she killed in the Games were Career Tributes.
Jennifer Lawrence has described her character as "a futuristic Joan of Arc" while promoting every Hunger Games movie to be released thus far, and Donald Sutherland described her as "more dangerous than Joan of Arc" in his initial letter to the first film's director regarding the character of Coriolanus Snow (shown in the DVD featurette "Letters from the Rose Garden").
In the film, Katniss weighs 122 pounds and has 23-1 odds of winning the Games.
The two people in her family closest to her, her father and Prim, both died in explosions.
Her decision to volunteer for Prim for the 74th Hunger Games not only saved her from certain death but saved the country from the oppressive rule of the Capitol. This stated, it is the primary driving event of the whole series.
Katniss killed both male tributes from District 1 in her two Games after they killed one of her allies; she killed Marvel after he threw the spear into Rue's stomach, and she killed Gloss after he slit Wiress' throat.
Katniss had received burns in all three books.
Katniss and Peeta are the only tributes to participate in the games two years in a row.
When the training scores are revealed, she and Peeta are the only tributes recognized by their first and last names.
In the Hunger Games A-Z, Suzanne Collins compares Katniss to the Greek warrior, Theseus.
Katniss, like many former tributes, suffers from PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). This was apparent in the movie, as she thought she shot Marvel while turkey hunting. She also had MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) for a period of time after Prim's death.
There is also a variation from the book as Katniss was meant to have olive skin rather than be Caucasian
She was District 12's very first volunteer according to Effie in the first film, while in the book District 12 "hadn't had a volunteer in decades."
In the book, Madge gave her the mockingjay pin, while in the movie, Greasy Sae gave it to her. She wore it in her suit for the whole thing and also when she goes into the other battles she brings along the pin.
Katniss's father made her first bow and arrow.
After the release of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, fans have speculated that Lucy Gray Baird, the District Twelve winner of the Tenth Hunger Games, is Katniss's ancestor, based on such clues as her singing voice and knowledge of herbs (likely Katniss's paternal grandmother, assuming Lucy returned to the Seam after the events of Ballad).
Lionsgate confirmed in March 2011 that about 30 actresses auditioned or read for the role of Katniss Everdeen, including Hailee Steinfeld, Abigail Breslin, Emma Roberts, Saoirse Ronan, Chloë Moretz, Jodelle Ferland, Lyndsy Fonseca, Emily Browning, Shailene Woodley, Danielle Chuchran, and Kaya Scodelario. On March 16, 2011, it was announced that Oscar nominee, Jennifer Lawrence of the indie film Winter's Bone had landed the coveted role. Ross described Lawrence as having "an incredible amount of self-assuredness, you got the sense that this girl knew exactly who she was. And then she came in and read for me and just knocked me out; I'd never seen an audition like that before in my life. It was one of those things where you just glimpse your whole movie in front of you." Though Lawrence was 20 when filming began, four years older than the character, Collins said that the character demanded "a certain maturity and power" and said she would rather the actress be older than younger. She added that Lawrence was the "only one who truly captured the character I wrote in the book," and that she had "every essential quality necessary to play Katniss." Lawrence, a fan of the books, took three days to accept the role, initially intimidated by the size of the production.
