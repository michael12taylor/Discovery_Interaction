<html><p>When he tells the pride about Mufasa's death, Scar lies that he did not make it to the gorge in time. Then Scar takes the throne and brings in the hyenas as his enforcers. Afterwards, he personally leads the hyenas to hunt instead of the lionesses so he can show his dominance over the kingdom, resulting in the Pride Lands becoming a wasteland years later due to his desire to kill prey where and when he wants, making the other lionesses unsatisfied. He offers Sarabi to become his queen, but she denies him, citing his greed and selfishness. To corner her, Scar enforces the rule that the lionesses can only eat the scraps from hyenas' foods until she concurs to become his queen. This causes Nala to depart and search for help, resulting in her looking for Simba as Nala manages to leave Pride Rock without getting caught by Scar.

When Simba returns home and encounters Scar after he attacks Sarabi, he goads him into revealing his "role" in Mufasa's death. While Simba anxiously tries to deny that he did not kill his father just as Scar tells him if he is a king or a betrayer, he pushes him into slipping at the edge of Pride Rock afterwards. Just as lighting strikes a dead tree to cause a massive fire in the Pride Lands, Scar cites that Mufasa had the same look in his eyes before he died, before Scar secretly tells Simba that he killed Mufasa. Upon hearing the truth about what his uncle did to his father, Simba bites Scar on his mane and pulls himself back up, angrily asking Scar how he could do this to his own brother. Scar tries to protect himself by denouncing Simba's sanity, claiming he killed Mufasa and now plans to kill him next, Sarabi however reveals that she overheard Scar talk about seeing the look in Mufasa's eyes before he died, contradicting him not arriving to gorge in time like he told the pride. Scar, realizing too late that he exposed himself, orders the hyenas to kill all the other lions and Simba as Nala orders the lionesses to fight against the hyenas.

Scar realizes his treachery has been discovered.
Seeing the pride, Zazu, Timon, Pumbaa, and Rafiki defeating his forces, Scar retreats to a ledge near the top of Pride Rock, where heâ€™s cornered by Simba. Scar begs for mercy and even double-crosses the hyenas, lying that they forced him into committing Mufusa's murder and denouncing them as "revolting scavengers" he was planning to kill in the end. Unknown to him, Shenzi, Kamari and Azizi are listening nearby and furiously leave to inform the other hyenas of his betrayal. Simba refuses to believe Scar's words, but he is pacified enough to choose exiling his uncle over killing him. Scar pretends to concede, but then he throws burning embers in Simba's face and attacks him while he is blinded, nearly pushing him over the edge; he raves this is his kingdom as well as his destiny. The two lions engage in a fierce duel and though Scar proves to be a surprisingly formidable opponent despite his weak appearance, Simba ultimately proves to be the stronger of the two and throws Scar off the edge of Pride Rock.

The last moments of Scar as he tries to survive against the hyenas in vain.
Scar survives the fall and as he struggles to his feet, Kamari, Azizi and several other surviving hyenas show up and surround him. At first, Scar is relieved to see them, saying that they must rebuild their forces if they are to retake what they have lost. Unfortunately, the seething Kamari and Azizi reveal they overheard him insulting and planning to kill them. Realizing his mistake too late, Scar tries to reason that he was only trying to fool Simba, and promises that together, they will rule the Pride Lands. However, Shenzi coldly tells him that the only true thing he ever said was that "a hyena's belly is never full", indirectly ordering her clan to devour him alive as revenge for using them and selling them out. Cornered and outnumbered, Scar briefly, but vainly attempts to fight back, only to be overwhelmed and devoured alive by the hyenas, bringing his reign to a well-deserved end. After Scar's death, Simba takes his place as the rightful king of the Pride Lands and undoing the damage his uncle had done, thus finally avenging Mufasa and restoring the land back to its former glory.

Other appearances
Scar makes a few cameos meant for comedy purposes in the animated series Timon & Pumbaa. He is seen when Timon tries to revive Pumbaa's amnesia after being struck by lightning, and when Zazu cleans out his trash can.

Scar in House of Mouse
In Hercules, Scar makes a cameo as a lion skin briefly worn by Hercules at one point, which in itself was a reference to one of Hercules' twelve labors, which was killing the Nemean Lion. It may also be a reference to a joke made by Zazu in the original film, where he suggested that Scar be made into a throw rug.

In House of Mouse, Scar made only a few minor cameos. In the episode "Jiminy Cricket", Jiminy used Scar as an example of temptations. At the end of that same episode, Scar was seen aside some of the other guests when they were arguing over Jiminy. In the episode "Ask Von Drake", Scar can be briefly seen being held by Rafiki just as Simba was in the film. In the episode "Goofy's Valentine Date", Scar was seen along with the other guests.

In the animated blooper reel featured in the The Lion King: Diamond Edition special features, Scar makes a cameo appearance, botching his line during Simba's climactic "trial" at Pride Rock and confessing he has no idea what he is doing.

In the Disney Crossy Road: The Animated Series episode "Hyena Havoc", Scar appears in pursuit of Simba, alongside the hyenas. Simba crosses a road of animals for safety, and Scar orders the hyenas to capture him. When they fail, Scar attempts to cross the road, himself, though he is comically trampled in the process, humiliating him.

Video games
The Lion King
Scar appeared in this video game as the final boss.

The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure
Scar appears as one of the bosses in this video game. He battles Simba and would jump onto a platform to roar, causing rocks to fall towards Simba which he has to dodge before he finally defeats Scar.

Kingdom Hearts II
Largely following the story of the film, Scar is the tyrannical ruler of the Pride Lands, after earning his throne through regicide (the murder of King Mufasa and supposedly Prince Simba). At some point, Scar meets Pete, an invader on a quest to dominate the worlds using a legion of demons known as the Heartless. With Pete's help, Scar rules the pride with discipline until Sora, Donald and Goofy arrive. With little food elsewhere, Scar attempts to devour the trio, only to be stopped by Nala, allowing them to escape. Once they do, they head out to find Simba, who was revealed to be alive by Sora. The group eventually finds him, and together, they return to Pride Rock to battle Scar. The tyrant is forced into revealing that he killed Mufasa, and a battle breaks loose, resulting in Scar's demise. However, the darkness of anger and jealousy in Scar's heart corrupts the lion and revives him in the form of a Heartless, drenching the Pride Lands in darkness as well. Sora and friends battle Scar, and he is eventually killed off.

During the second visit, it is revealed an army of Scar's ghost is haunting the Pridelands. According to Rafiki, the ghosts feed off of Simba's insecurity towards being king. As a manifestation, Scar constantly tortures and taunts the new ruler, until a turn of events prompts Simba to stand up to the demon, finally having the courage necessary to send him off for good. However, the army then comes together and converge to create the Groundshaker Heartless to face Simba and Sora before the two are able to destroy it and the ghosts of Scar for good.

This rendition of Scar is somewhat darker than in the original film since, aside from him becoming a full Heartless upon being defeated by Simba, he was also implied to be a cannibal due to his attempting to devour Sora (who at the time appeared as a lion cub).

Disney Heroes: Battle Mode
Scar appears in this game as one of the infected and unlockable heroes. He is currently unlocked with 80 tokens. His ability to roar to silence enemies was not present in the original film since he never roared. He also has a stealth ability and a basic attack with his claws. His mission friends are Maleficent, the Queen of Hearts, Timon, Pumbaa and Jafar.

Other games
Like the cameo in the film Hercules, Scar also makes a cameo as a throw rug in a specific area of the game Hades Challenge. Like before, the cameo also references one of Hercules' twelve labors, specifically his defeating the Nemean Lion.

In Epic Mickey, Scar appears as a stained-glass portrait in the Mad Doctor's laboratory along with Maleficent and Captain Hook. There are also two lion statues in the courtyard of Dark Beauty Castle that bare resemblance to Scar.

Scar also appeared as an unlockable costume character in Disney Universe. He is also the boss of the last level of The Lion King universe, where you ride on a train for transportation to battle him with a cannon.

Musical
Scar in the Broadway musical.
Scar is the main villain in the Broadway musical adaptation of The Lion King. In the original run of the show, in 1997, the character of Scar was portrayed by John Vickery, and is generally portrayed as an intellectual, immature prince, with a heavy hint of comedic elements in an (arguably) more prominent light than his animated counterpart.

Scar's role is also expanded upon with the song "The Madness of King Scar". In it, Scar begins doubting his reign, fearing that he might be losing the respect of the lionesses and indirectly receives an idea from Zazu that he needs a queen to ensure that his family line continues for generations, thus giving him immortality. He attempts to seduce Nala when he chooses her as his queen, promising to share the throne with her, to bear many cubs and to love her dearly, but she rebukes him by scratching his face after realizing what this would truly mean for her. The musical also implies that he might harbor some guilt for murdering Mufasa, as he mentions that Mufasa's ghost kept on haunting him. The musical also implies that his main motives for wanting to become king were due to neglect that he suffered while he was young, especially in comparison to Mufasa.

Disney Parks
Scar in Disney's Once Upon a Dream Parade in Disneyland Paris.
Disneyland Resort
In World of Color, Scar can be briefly seen in the water projectors and heard vocally throughout a sequence based on the wildebeest stampede from the film. In addition, Scar was featured in the 2015 rendition of the show, during the brief montage celebrating villains.

Walt Disney World
Scar plays a role in Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom. In Adventureland, Scar returns from the dead via Hades and is given a proposition to live forever in exchange for the crystal of the Magic Kingdom. Scar tricks the hyenas into believing he is invincible and forces them to work for him again. However, the park guests prove that Scar lied by injuring him in front of the hyenas, prompting them to leave their former boss. Scar consoles Hades for more power, but Hades refuses and leaves the lion to battle the park guests alone. Scar is defeated, but a recovered piece of the crystal imbues him with magic, allowing him to take on the guests once again. Scar is once again defeated, however, saving the kingdom from his wrath.

Scar appears as one of the main villains in the live nighttime spectacular Fantasmic!. In the show, Scar is called forth by The Evil Queen to destroy Mickey Mouse once and for all. In the end, Scar is killed by Mickey along with the other villains. His only line was "Yes, perfect."

In Happily Ever After, Scar is one of the villains featured during the adversity segment. He is seen battling Simba on Pride Rock as it is engulfed in flames.

Scar's likeness is also featured in Disney's Art of Animation Resort.

Disneyland Paris
In France, Scar was featured on the villains' float in Disney's Once Upon a Dream Parade.

Hong Kong Disneyland
Scar appears as one of Maleficent's invited guests during the climactic projection montage of Villains Night Out!

Shanghai Disneyland
Scar appears in the Shanghai resort's production of The Lion King stage musical.

Disney Cruise Line
Aboard the Disney Dream, Scar and the hyenas are featured in Villains Tonight as some of the villains that assist Hades in retaining ownership of the Underworld. Their motif in the show resembles that of a biker gang.

Trivia
Scar is based on Claudius from Hamlet who was a prince who murdered his brother the king for the sake of his throne. However, unlike the diabolically evil Scar, Claudius had a kind side and genuinely believed that he could make the country a better place and was a highly competent king whereas Scar cared only for himself. Like Scar, Claudius was cunning, intelligent, manipulative, charismatic, and ruthless. Unlike the diabolically evil Scar, Claudius repented from his wrongdoings and did not reveal the secret truth about his brother's murder to his family.
He is also similar to the Shakespearean villain Iago from Othello, being sadistic, charming, smooth-talking, bitter, envious and narcissistic.
He also shares many similarities to the title tragic anti-hero character in Macbeth. Although not directly related, he started out as an honorable soldier to King Duncan. Like Scar, he believed he would be next in line for the throne as the king's son Malcolm was too young. However, when it became official that Malcolm would take over as king, Macbeth then plotted to kill King Duncan in order to scare his children away from the kingdom over accusations of murder, thus taking the throne for himself (similar to what Scar had happened to Mufasa and Simba). Macbeth succeeded in this and became a ruthless greedy king like Scar, leading to corruption in his kingdom, as he also had many people whom he thought were suspicious of him all murdered. Eventually, Malcolm returned to the kingdom and got his revenge (though more indirectly as he let Macduff fight and kill Macbeth rather than facing the latter himself, like Simba did) and claimed his rightful place as king of Scotland.

In A Tale of Two Brothers, Scar's birth name, "Taka", is the Swahili word for "waste".
In an original draft for the ending of The Lion King, Scar was to be shown burned alive after defeating Simba, and throwing him off the ledge to his apparent demise, with Scar laughing as he did so (presumably due to completely losing his sanity over losing everything along with the belief that Simba fell to his death), which also results in the Pride Lands' destruction. The ending was cut due to its dark and horrific nature being too mature for a Disney film. The final version of Scar's death was based on an original draft for Gaston's demise in Beauty and the Beast, in which the wolves would have attacked Gaston after surviving the fall from the Beast's castle with a broken leg. Ironically, Gaston's demise in the original draft was cut for the exact same reason why it ended up being reused in The Lion King.
Despite the original ending being cut, Simba did nonetheless imply with his remark of "Fire's a killer" when relaying to Kovu about the true reason behind his fight with Scar that Scar did still end up burned alive.

Originally, Scar would chase Simba out of the Pride Lands himself.
Scar apparently hates the song "It's a Small World", as he tells Zazu "No, no. Anything but that" when he tries to sing it. In some productions of the stage show held, Zazu originally sang "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", prior to the world premiere of Mary Poppins in Bristol, England, shortly before transferring to London's West End in 2004, but soon after the release of Frozen, Zazu sang "Let It Go" instead. Scar's reaction was the same.
Scar is the first Disney villain to be biologically related to the protagonist in the Disney canon. The previous villains such as the Evil Queen and Lady Tremaine were related to the protagonists only by marriage.
When he killed Mufasa, he was originally supposed to say "Good night, sweet prince!" immediately before throwing him off, referring to the Shakespearean play Hamlet. However, it was changed to Scar smugly saying "Long live the king!" to Mufasa because the former line seemed too "self-aware" to be taken seriously. In the alternate ending, Scar also was supposed to say the former line when attempting to finish off Simba, but it was instead changed to Scar admitting his crime to his nephew.
Scar's greed for power is very similar to Adolf Hitler when he stands on a cliff and looks on his Hyena "army" in "Be Prepared". It shows the classic Nazi-Germany influence with hundreds of "soldiers" on the march when their "dictator" is watching on at the moment of power. In fact, a behind the scenes documentary for the film revealed that they used documentary footage relating to Hitler and Nazi Germany for designing "Be Prepared".
Scar makes a nod to an earlier film starring Jeremy Irons. When Simba remarks that Scar is weird, Scar replies "You have no idea." The character played by Irons makes exactly the same response to this statement in the film Reversal of Fortune.
As explained in "Lions of the Outlands" during his reign, he shared the knowledge of the Roar of the Elders with Zira.
In an interview with HelloGiggles, The Lion King producer Don Hahn claimed that Mufasa and Scar were actually not related by blood. Instead, he clarified that, as with real lions, Scar and Mufasa were a coalition of two unrelated males, with one being dominant over the other. The onscreen dynamic between Scar and Mufasa was heavily inspired by this real-life behavior, and that Scar's well-known quote of "As far as brains go, I got the lion's share. But when it comes to brute strength...I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool." references this lack of family bond between the two characters.
However, a little over a week later, director Rob Minkoff "cleared up" in an interview with Screen Junkies that Mufasa and Scar grew up together and were, in fact, blood-related. He also claimed that Scar's name is a "really mean nickname", and that he believes that Mufasa was the one who gave Scar his scar when they were cubs.

He also claimed that Scar's name is a "really mean nickname", and that he believes that Mufasa was the one who gave Scar his scar when they were cubs.
Though he is well known after his death, Scar's demise at the jaws of his hyena minions is not well known. Both Simba and Janja claim that Scar dies in the fire, while Zira believes that Scar was killed by Simba.
Throughout the movie, Scar rarely retracts his claws. This is purposely done to differentiate him from the others as he is the antagonist.
There are three conflicting accounts on how Scar got his trademark deformity, and by extension, his nickname.
In the non-canonical book A Tale of Two Brothers, he got it from recklessly engineering a cape buffalo riot to embarrass Mufasa, and getting cut in the face with one of the horns. He then asks to be called "Scar". This book also states that his birth name is Taka: Swahili for "waste" and same as one of Kiburi's followers.
In a flashback of the episode "Battle for the Pride Lands", an unnamed snake attacked him and successfully bit him in the eye before he ultimately killed it. After reporting this to Mufasa, he would've been given the terrible nickname of Scar, which would've motivated him to kill the King and take over the Pride Lands. Scar would later reference this account to Kion just before his permanent demise.
In the 2019 remake, Mufasa was heavily implied to have given him that the scar in a challenge.

According to Ford Riley, Scar was originally named after Askari, the leader of the first Lion Guard. It was shortened by Mufasa to the nickname "Scar" after he got his scar.
"Askari" is Swahili for "police", "guard" or "soldier".
"Askari" is Swahili for "police", "guard" or "soldier".
