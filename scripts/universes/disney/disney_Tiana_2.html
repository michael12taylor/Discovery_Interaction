<html><p>Tiana is a meetable character at the Disney parks, dressed in her "lilypad/flower" gown from the movie. She made her debut in the temporary 2009 boat show, Tiana's Showboat Jubilee in promotion for the film.

Disneyland
In California, Tiana makes meet-and-greet appearances in New Orleans Square.

Tiana also appears in Mickey's Soundsational Parade, within her own float, alongside Louis.

Near the end of Mickey and the Magical Map, Yen Sid's apprentice Mickey Mouse travels to New Orleans for one final adventure with Tiana and many other citizens as they perform "Dig a Little Deeper".

Animatronic versions of Tiana (as a human and frog) can also be seen in the Enchanted Window display along Main Street, U.S.A.

Walt Disney World
In Florida, Tiana makes appearances in Fantasmic! and Festival of Fantasy Parade.

For meet-and-greets, Tiana is currently available primarily at the Magic Kingdom's Princess Fairytale Hall.

Tiana plays a major role in Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom. In Frontierland and Liberty Square, Doctor Facilier returns from his death via Hades and plans to turn Tiana back into a frog permanently as revenge for his demise. He kidnaps her and takes her to his parlor, where the park guests free her and allow her to escape. After Facilier is defeated, Tiana meets up with Mama Odie, Louis, and Merlin aboard the Liberty Square Riverboat to celebrate the guests' success. Tiana also has her own spell card known as "Tiana's Hot Sauce".

At the Disney's Port Orleans Resort, Tiana is the central character because of its ties to New Orleans between her film and the resort. A story was given to the resort after its refurbishment. Disney Princesses Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora, Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, and Rapunzel gathered together to grant gifts to Tiana. Some include carpets resembling the Magic Carpet from Jasmine, shower curtains with artwork of "dinglehoppers" and "snarfbalts" from Ariel, mirror frames with woodcarvings of woodland creatures from Snow White and much more.

Daily, Tiana appears as one of Goofy's invited guests in Mickey's Royal Friendship Faire at the Magic Kingdom, dressed in a 1920s flapper dress. During her segment, she teaches Goofy how to dance to the rhythm of jazz.

Tiana plays a major role in the castle spectacular, Happily Ever After. She is the first Disney character to appear, and starts off the show by singing "Down in New Orleans" on the castle balcony. She appears a few times afterward, including the stain-glass finale; her image can be spotted at the highest point of the castle.

Tokyo Disney Resort
Although Tiana does not do meet-and-greet sessions in the resort, she appears alongside Naveen in the Tokyo DisneySea version of Fantasmic! as animated characters during the princess segment.

Disneyland Paris
In Disneyland Paris, Tiana is found at the Princess Pavilion in Fantasyland. She holds a mask while enter The Starlit Princess Waltz at 25th Anniversary. Princesses hold fans and switch them and dance with Naveen and princes.

Hong Kong Disneyland
She appears in the show Mickey and the Wondrous Book, performed in Storybook Theater at Hong Kong Disneyland on November 17, 2015. Here, she performs renditions of "Almost There" and "Dig a Little Deeper". On November 20, 2020, she appeared with all the other princesses (in her regular dress) at the opening ceremony of the Castle of Magical Dreams. She has yet to do meet-and-greet sessions however after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Shanghai Disneyland
In Shanghai, Tiana's likeness is featured on the The Princess and the Frog mosaic mural in Enchanted Storybook Castle, as well as one of the castle's walls carving displays. She also appears during the finale of Ignite the Dream.

Disney Cruise Line
In Believe, Tiana, Naveen, Charlotte, and several New Orleans residents assist Mama Odie in her job to help a stiff father believe in magic. In the show, Tiana performs "Dig a Little Deeper" and "Gonna Take You There".

Tiana also has a restaurant in her honor; appropriately named Tiana's Place aboard the Disney Wonder. When she makes appearances, she dons her outfit featured in "Almost There" and engages in meet-and-greets with guests.

Disney Princess
Tiana was officially welcomed into the Disney Princess Royal Court on March 14, 2010, to coincide with the Blu-ray and DVD release of The Princess and the Frog. The coronation event took place in The New York Palace, in New York City. Joining the festivities were the original eight Disney Princesses, as well as Prince Naveen.

A similar event in the Magic Kingdom park at Walt Disney World also took place, welcoming Tiana into the massive group of Disney characters in front of Cinderella Castle.

Redesign
The only major change Tiana received in the Disney Princess redesign is that there are two more wavy strands of hair by her face. Her dress has not changed except that glittery designs of reeds have been added.

Palace Pets
Tiana's Palace Pets are Lily, Bayou, Birdadette, and Olive.

Differences from the source material
Tiana is an original character for Disney, going on a unique, originally written adventure, though she was partly inspired by E. D. Baker's 2002 novel The Frog Princess, and the original fairy tale "The Frog Prince". Of course, Disney enacted some changes to make the story their own.

The Frog Prince by the Brothers Grimm
The heroine is already a princess and triggers the frog prince's shapeshifting by tossing him against her bedroom wall. In later adaptations, it was changed to into a kiss.
The frog prince and the princess met at a well that lay under an old linden tree deep in a great dark wood near the castle.
An exchange was made if the frog retrieved the princess' golden ball that fell into the well, that being if he would be loved as a companion and playfellow and sit at the table to dine with the princess and eat from her plate and drink from her cup and sleep on her bed.
The princess doesn't have a dream to fulfill.
She had four older sisters.
No mother is mentioned, but only the father who is the king.
The enchanted prince has a servant named Henry who travels to the castle of the princess who has married the disenchanted prince to escort them back to the kingdom of the prince's father.
The Frog Princess by E. D. Baker
Rather than marrying into royalty, the main character Emmeralda (nicknamed Emma) was born the princess of the fictional Greater Greensward.
Emma's transformation into a frog when she kissed the prince, named Eadric, was caused by a magical charm bracelet given to her by her aunt. Similarly, they both regain their human forms by kissing each other again while she is wearing it.
Emma and Eadric do not marry until a later installment in the book series.
Unlike Tiana, who was known for her strong work ethic, Emma was clumsy, socially awkward, and dissatisfied with her life as a princess, particularly an upcoming arranged marriage to a prince from another land. She also could practice magic, although this skill of hers was not fully developed until the later books.

Trivia
Tiana is (to date) the only Disney Princess to have her father dead and her mother alive; it is typically the other way around.
Her name 'Tiana' is of Slavic origin that means "fairy queen".
Tiana is the first Disney Princess to defeat her film's villain, Dr. Facilier.
During her quest to own her business, it is a notable trend that the male characters in the movie constantly undermine and demean Tiana to become a successful female entrepreneur.
Tiana as the protagonist is present and relevant for almost the entire film, but her screen time as a human was limited to about 19 minutes.
Tiana is left-handed (like her voice actress is). However, despite being left-handed, Tiana is showing signing a paper with her right hand in her fantasy during the "Almost There" number, but this is likely just a goof.
Tiana's story is immensely inspired by the life of Leah Chase. Chase is a highly-respected, African American chef in New Orleans. She is known as the Queen of Creole Cuisine. Chase even contributed recipes to "Tiana's Cookbook" that was released after the film.
Tiana is one of five Disney Princesses who do not have a sequel to their film. The other four are Snow White, Aurora, Merida, and Moana.
Tiana is the Disney Princess seen wearing the most outfits. In total, she wore 11 on different occasions in her debut film (10 if you don't count the dress she wore as a child).
Several other African American celebrities wanted the role of Tiana before Anika Noni Rose was cast, including model and television personality Tyra Banks, singer-songwriter Alicia Keys and recording artist Jennifer Hudson (Hudson would later pose as Tiana in the Disney Dream Portrait Series).
In the first act of the film, Tiana's clothes are mostly in dull subdued colors, symbolizing her overly serious workaholic personality. After she's turned into a frog, she slowly learns to lighten up and live life to the fullest. After she returns to her human form, Tiana's clothes become noticeably brighter, mirroring her change of heart.
For much of the film, Naveen calls Tiana "Princess" and later "Waitress", symbolizing his objectification of women as a whole. He doesn't call her by her real name until after the song 'Ma Belle Evangeline', when he starts to fall in love with her.
She is the first Disney princess to be proposed to on screen in the film, unlike the other princesses as they only kiss their love interests and then get married. The second Disney couple to do this is in Frozen II when Kristoff proposes to Anna.
Tiana didn't go to college, but she is the only Disney Princess with an actual job that makes money. What's more, the fact that she doesn't trust banks and keeps her money in jars seems ironic considering the Great Depression occurred only a few years later.
She is also the only princess with a wedding ring.
Even though Anna of Arendelle also has a ring (given to her in Frozen II), she's currently a queen, making Tiana the only current princess with a wedding ring.
Even though Anna of Arendelle also has a ring (given to her in Frozen II), she's currently a queen, making Tiana the only current princess with a wedding ring.
Tiana and Naveen kiss each other five times in the film, more than any other couple in a Disney princess movie.
The streetcar Tiana takes to work, during an early scene, is labeled with the number "A113". A113 was the room for the animation department at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts; the room now houses graphic design classes). During the 1970s, directors John Musker and Ron Clements, in addition to Disney/Pixar animation executive John Lasseter and Pixar director Brad Bird, studied animation in room A113. "A113" labels are hidden in Disney and Pixar films.
According to Disneystrology, her birthday would be on December 25th.
On the Disney Princess line-up, Tiana is franchised with her green bayou wedding gown, but without the veil.
Tiana along with Elsa, Daisy Duck and Meg is one of the few Disney heroines to sport eye shadow.
Tiana is the first African American character and princess to make appearances at Disney theme parks.
Tiana is currently the last Princess shown in traditional, hand-drawn animation.
Since launching her restaurant Tiana's Palace, she is the only Disney royal with a legitimate business prior to her marriage to Naveen.
Prior to the release of Ralph Breaks the Internet, there was some controversy regarding Tiana's redesign, specifically her lightened skin tone and sharper features. In response, Tiana's scenes in the film were reanimated so that she more closely resembled her original depiction.
Tiana makes a mistake in saying, "There is no way I am kissing a frog and eating a bug on the same day," because she says that on the day after she kissed Naveen. However, if she kissed Naveen at the party after midnight then her statement about both events happening on the same day would be correct.
