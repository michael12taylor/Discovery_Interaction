<html><p>In her bedroom, Rapunzel laments her feelings of guilt to Cassandra, who believes Rapunzel could use some downtime. She offers to take Rapunzel beyond Corona's security wall — a forbidden act — and sneaks the princess out with the help of Maximus. During their outing, Cassandra takes Rapunzel to the former location of the healing flower that saved Rapunzel and her mother when the latter fell ill during her pregnancy. Mysterious thorn-like rocks have appeared in the area, and not only are they ominous, but also unbreakable. As Rapunzel examines the area further, she is struck by magic that causes her long, golden hair to grow back. After returning to the castle, Rapunzel and Cassandra try to rid themselves of the hair, but like the rocks, it is unbreakable. Eugene arrives and discovers the truth, offering assistance in hiding it from Queen Arianna and King Frederic. Cassandra gets the idea of hiding the hair in an oversized wig, which helps well enough despite the awkwardness.

Rapunzel then joins her parents for breakfast, and in during which, Frederic admits that his methods of protecting Rapunzel have been rather unfair, and notes that he is reconsidering his decisions, much to Rapunzel's excitement. Afterward, Arianna visits Rapunzel in the latter's bedroom, to bestow a coronation gift. She encourages Rapunzel to choose how to live her life — and eventually rule the kingdom — despite her father's stubbornness and what others may think. She gives Rapunzel a journal she once used in her younger years, with a note the reads: "Plus est en vous", meaning, "There is more in you".

Rapunzel and her father's falling out.
Later on, Rapunzel's coronation ceremony begins, and in during which, the royal family is confronted by a pirate known as Lady Caine, who seeks vengeance on King Frederic for imprisoning her father. Frederic and the rest of the royal guests are kidnapped, but Rapunzel refuses to stand down and reveals her golden hair. She uses it as a weapon to defeat the pirates with Eugene and Cassandra's help, saving her father. That night, despite proving her worth, Frederic feels more insecure about Rapunzel's safety than ever before. With the very reason Rapunzel was taken in the first place having returned, Frederic feels he's forced to forbid Rapunzel from ever leaving the walls of Corona without his consent, driving his daughter to tears. With her father's new law, Rapunzel feels trapped once more, similar to her imprisonment within the tower. Eugene arrives and comforts her, uplifting her spirits and at the same time reconciles their relationship. After he leaves, Rapunzel reads the message in the journal given to her by Arianna and becomes inspired to pursue the adventures she's always desired (such as uncovering the mystery behind her hair's return), despite the obstacles she will have to face.

Tangled: The Series
Season One
Rapunzel with Pascal in Tangled: The Series.
Starting off one week after the events of Tangled: Before Ever After, the animated series continues Rapunzel's life as a princess. Throughout the course of the series, Rapunzel steadily continues to grow as a person, as the relationships she shares with her family, friends and subjects provide her with new experiences that challenges her and her ideals. In addition to finding her place in the world, Rapunzel also deals with the issue of her hair's sudden and mysterious return. In "What the Hair?!", Rapunzel and Cassandra meet a young alchemist named Varian, and through him, discover that her hair has lost its healing powers, but has gained indestructibility. Unfortunately, Varian's workshop was destroyed before further information could be obtained. Sometime later in "Great Expotations", Rapunzel and Cassandra learn that Varian has discovered the mysterious black rocks near his village. Rapunzel then declares that Cassandra, Varian, and herself will work together to learn more about the rocks and the connection they have to her hair.

Unfortunately, as the rocks continue to expand throughout the kingdom, portions of Varian's village is destroyed, prompting him to seek Rapunzel's help in "Queen for a Day". At the same time, Rapunzel is taking over for her parents when they go away to celebrate their anniversary, and has barely any knowledge. When Rapunzel is unable to provide assistance for Varian at the time due to a separate kingdom-wide disaster caused by the magic of the evil warlock Zhan Tiri (Corona is being destroyed by a deadly blizzard and her parents are missing), Varian swears vengeance against the princess; in the end, Rapunzel manages to destroy the blizzard with the legendary Demanitus Device, Pascal nearly sacrificing himself in the process, and is reunited with her parents, but has doubt over becoming queen which Eugene reassures her over. Her doubt continues in "Painter's Block", where she's so shaken from the blizzard that she cannot bring herself to think of an idea for the castle mural, so she takes up an art class to get her mojo back. However, her art teacher, Mrs. Sugarby, is actually Sugracha the Eternal, one of Zhan Tiri's followers who was released from the Demanitus Device when it activated, and mind controls Rapunzel into setting differences aside and freeing Zhan Tiri. Eugene and Cassandra manage to stop her and save Rapunzel, and she finally gets her confidence back.

In "The Quest for Varian", Rapunzel reassumes her mission to uncover the truth behind the black rocks, and discovers along the way that her father had not only been aware of their threat, but had made it his mission to keep Rapunzel and Corona's population from investigating them. Rapunzel repeatedly pursues her father for answers but receives none. Rapunzel meets Varian again in "The Alchemist Returns", and discovers his true shady intentions after discovering the empty Attitude-Reversing Potion flacon in his bag, which he found and reverse engineered into a truth serum. In addition, Varian discovers the Sundrop Flower is useless and cannot free his father, as its powers have been transferred to Rapunzel. After Varian kidnaps the queen as part of his revenge scheme in "Secret of the Sun Drop", however, King Frederic finally confesses the truth to Rapunzel so that they may set aside their differences and work together to save Arianna.

Rapunzel follows the trail left by the rocks.
According to Frederic, legend foretold that, should the Sun Drop Flower be removed from its place of origin, a devastating darkness would be unleashed. In his desperation, Frederic took the flower to save a dying Arianna, allowing her to live and give birth to Rapunzel. However, the guilt of unleashing a darkness upon his kingdom stuck with Frederic. Understanding that Frederic's actions were out of love for his family, Rapunzel finally comes to trust her father again. Together, with the people of Corona by their side, the two are able to rescue Arianna, but Varian was unable to free Quirin with Rapunzel's hair as intended, and is furious when he cannot be with his father while Rapunzel is reunited with both her parents, and attempts to destroy them as payback. By making physical contact with the rocks, Rapunzel is able to unleash their full potential, and uses this power to defeat Varian. Realizing the consequences that his actions had caused, Frederic apologizes for his overprotectiveness and comes to terms with Rapunzel's right to independence. With the black rocks having reshaped to form a path meant to lead Rapunzel to an unknown destination beyond Corona's walls, the princess decides to follow their trail to uncover her destiny with Eugene, Cassandra, Pascal, Maximus, Lance, Hook Foot and Shorty in tow.

Season Two
Rapunzel receives the second piece of scroll from Adira.
Rapunzel—now donning new attire—sets off with her friends in a customized caravan, following the path left by the rocks. As Rapunzel's first time outside of Corona, the princess embraces her newfound freedom with zeal and finds enjoyment at nearly every stop. In "Beyond the Corona Walls", Eugene tries to propose to Rapunzel, again, but the princess is still unsure about marriage. This leaves Eugene downhearted and doubtful, while also creating an awkward atmosphere amongst the group. After a situation involving Stalyan—Eugene's ex-fiancée who wished to finish their union—Rapunzel comes to realise just how much she truly loves Eugene. The princess tries to propose, but Eugene stops her midway, instead of wanting Rapunzel to focus on her newfound freedom. Discreetly disappointed, Rapunzel halfheartedly accepts, but nevertheless is happy that she and Eugene are together again. In the same episode, Rapunzel meets a peculiar woman named Adira, who had been studying the rocks. According to Adira, the rocks had been searching for Rapunzel, explaining why they appeared in Corona. Having succeeded in finding her, the rocks have now formed a trail leading to the Dark Kingdom; only by journeying there will Rapunzel fulfill her destiny.

Rapunzel using the reverse incantation.
After months of travel and strange encounters, Adira reveals that the only way to the Dark Kingdom is to pass through the Great Tree, which was once the great stronghold of Zhan Tiri. Inside, the group finds some mysterious writings which they cannot translate. However, one scroll was translated, and it contained the Healing Incantation. They also learn about the Moonstone and find the reverse incantation, which turns Rapunzel's hair and eyes black and begins to suck the life out of everything around her, including her friends. Rapunzel later uses this power to defeat Hector, a villainous warrior attempting to prevent the group from entering the Dark Kingdom. Cassandra warns Rapunzel not to use the reverse incantation because of its deadly effects, but Rapunzel is unable to stop it once she starts. When Casandra attempts to do so, her arm is severely wounded, forcing her to later cover herself in a discarded knight's armor.

Rapunzel shocked by Cassandra's betrayal.
Rapunzel and Cassandra become distant from each other for a while, but they eventually talk it out and makeup. However, after their adventures in the House of Yesterday's Tomorrow, Cassandra distanced herself from Rapunzel again, but acted as if everything was fine. Eventually, the group finally reached the Dark Kingdom, where they are confronted by King Edmund, who revealed himself to be Eugene's father. The group learn more about the Moonstone Opal through Edmund and Adira. When they finally convinced the king to let them see the Moonstone, Rapunzel, Eugene, Pascal, and Cassandra entered the Moonstone's chamber. Rapunzel thanked Cassandra for everything and told Eugene that she loves him before reaching for the stone to fulfill her destiny. However, before she could even touch it, Cassandra grabs the stone and declares she is fulfilling her own destiny and becomes merged with it. Rapunzel watched in shock and horror as her former friend betrayed her and told her that she had warned her to be careful who she trusts.

Season Three
Rapunzel trying to reach out to Cassandra.
Soon, Rapunzel learned that Cassandra was Mother Gothel's biological daughter, however, Gothel abandoned Cassandra in favor of Rapunzel. This lead to Cassandra holding a grudge against Rapunzel for the remainder of the journey, angered at always being second-best to her, and ultimately grabbing the Moonstone to prevent Rapunzel's destiny from coming into this fruition. Despite this shocking information, Rapunzel had tried to make list of this situation by claiming they are sisters in life, unfortunately, Cassandra refused. Rapunzel tried to reason with Cassandra, but her former friend ran away and cut down the bridge she made out of black rocks to leave the princess stranded at the Dark Kingdom. Even though Rapunzel was heartbroken by the betrayal, she acted surprisingly cheerful. Just then, Ulf arrived in a hot air balloon and, with Shorty translating for him, told Rapunzel and the others that Corona was in trouble. They took the hot air balloon back home. Rapunzel was very happy to be home, but soon realised that the Separatists of Saporia, with the help of Varian, erased her parents' memories and took over Corona. When they escaped capture from them, they hid in Xavier's blacksmith shop, where some of Corona's citizens were waiting for her. Xavier explained what happened while she was away and that the Captain of the guards and some soldiers started a search party to find her. Rapunzel, still hurt by Cassandra's betrayal, decided to take back the kingdom on her own. But the plan failed when she got captured while she was in Cassandra's room and cried over her betrayal. She tried to talk Varian out of his plan of wiping everyone else's memories and soon learned that he only wanted to do so because he truly felt bad for his actions. When the Separatists decided to use Varian's chemicals to destroy Corona, Varian turned against them and helped Rapunzel defeat them. After saving Corona, she used the Reverse Incantation to free Quirin. She was happy to see the father and son reunited and that Varian became her friend again. Soon afterward, Rapunzel took over as acting queen of Corona until her parents have fully restored their memories. She also opened up about her feelings about Cassandra's betrayal to Eugene.

Rapunzel as acting Queen of Corona.
Thanks to her journey to the Dark Kingdom, Rapunzel had gained the wisdom and experience she needs to lead her people and help them get through the hard times, along which were werewolf attacks, arguments while repairing the kingdom, and returning stolen goods. Meanwhile, Rapunzel held on to a belief that Cassandra is still good deep down and would never give up on her, no matter what anyone said. When Corona got plagued by fear-induced red rocks, she saw a vision of Cassandra taking over the kingdom. But what really scared her was losing Cassandra as a friend. She and Varian worked together to encase the rocks' roots in amber and saved the kingdom. In the process though, when she touched one of the rocks, she could sense Cassandra and that she was just as scared as she was. This made Rapunzel more than sure that Cass could still be saved.

Then, after helping Pascal save his dragon friend and finding the lost Captain, she prepared a real birthday celebration for Eugene and was planning to propose to him. But when the party just got started, Cassandra arrived and demanded the Demanitus scroll. Rapunzel came to Varian in the Demanitus chamber to see that he had translated and memorized almost the entire scroll. But then Cassandra came and fought with her before taking the scroll and Varian, as he was the only person who knew the translation. Rapunzel and her friends discussed on what to do until they saw a new black tower appear, made from the black rocks by Cassandra when she learned the third incantation. They went to the tower and after some failed attempts to get inside, an entrance appeared, and they entered. Rapunzel and Eugene went up the tower and found Varian, who had discovered the fourth incantation but was having trouble reading it as it needed sunlight to be seen. She handed the engagement ring to Eugene and went to look for Cass while Eugene help Varian. She found her and tried to reason with her again, but Cass wouldn't listen. When Rapunzel refused to fight her, Cassandra brought Eugene and Varian inside and threatened Eugene's life. Varian showed the fourth incantation to Rapunzel, and she used it to stop Cassandra. But even though she was victorious, she knew it wasn't over yet.

Later, she and Eugene got a message from Calliope, telling her she was in danger, and raced to the spire to help her. It was there when she met the Enchanted Girl, who later revealed herself to be Zhan Tiri. She tried to stop them from taking the Mind Trap, but she couldn't bring herself to let Calliope get trapped in a magic lamp in the process. Then, when she heard about Gothel's ghost haunting her old cottage, she went there to investigate, only to find out that the ghost was a fake. But then Cassandra arrived and fought with her until they both got trapped in an underground mine. She convinced Cass to work with her to find a way out. While looking, they found a room with magic mirrors that showed projections of Gothel talking about herself. Rapunzel explained to Cass that the only good thing Gothel had ever done was bringing them together. But unbeknownst to them, Zhan Tiri slipped one of the mirrors into Rapunzel's bag and when Cassandra found it, it showed a scene of Gothel giving little Cass a music box in apparently a loving manner. This made Cassandra angry, thinking that Rapunzel knew about it and tried to hide it from her, and as Rapunzel tried to explain that she didn't, Cass left her to die in the mine. But fortunately, Pascal saved Rapunzel. Rapunzel promised him that she still would not give up on Cass.

She then supervises the preparations of defending Corona from Cassandra or any other threats. During which, she helped Eugene catch a man who was posing as Flynn Rider, Eugene's former alter ego, and arrested the Baron, who was seeking revenge for what happened to him in "Beyond Corona Walls". Then she learned that Eugene and Varian had created "Project Obsidian" to encase Cassandra in amber. She disapproved of it at first, but then agreed that they could only use it as the last resort. Later, her father announces that the Goodwill festival will be cancelled due to Cassandra's possible threats. But Rapunzel offered to see if anyone would still want to continue the festival and one person did speak up, Faith (who was actually Cassandra in disguise in an attempt to make up with Rapunzel after realizing the truth about Zhan Tiri). The festival proceeded and throughout the day, Rapunzel and "Faith" spend time together to make sure it goes well. But when the disguised Cassandra tried to talk to Rapunzel alone, Zhan Tiri pulled the cloak off her, exposing her. While everybody panicked and tried to take Cassandra down, Rapunzel told her that it's not too late to make things right. But as Cassandra consider her words, Zhan Tiri made Varian's Obsidian launched at her. Believing that Rapunzel sees her as a threat like everybody else, she breaks free and declared herself a bad guy. Then she knocked the princess out with a potion. When Rapunzel woke up, she learned that Cass had taken over Corona, just as she had feared.

In "Plus Est En Vous", Rapunzel looks back to where she first touched the Black Rocks. Queen Arianna comforts her, and they return to their new headquarters in the Snuggly Duckling to inspire the people of the Corona to fight back. Thanks to Varian, Rapunzel learned that Demanitus sealed Zhan Tiri away with a device whose blueprints were locked away in his tomb. On their way up, she gives Eugene the name G-bug which disgusts him. Rapunzel looks around to see the tomb was inhabited by monkeys and concludes that this was where Demanitus found Vigor. She and Eugene spots the journal which contained the plans, only for it to be snatched away by the monkeys. To make matters worse, Lance toys with the ray Demanitus used to switch his mind with Vigor's and uses it on everyone, Rapunzel included. Despite her orders for everyone to leave it alone, they fought over it for hours until everyone was restored to their normal bodies and given Varian the journal.

Varian admits that he can build the machine, it has to be near Zhan Tiri to seal her away. As a result, Rapunzel and friends storm the castle and made their way to the throne room. While Varian puts the machine together, Rapunzel searches for Cassandra but finds Zhan Tiri instead. She tries to force her to give her the Sundrop, but she refuses. Rapunzel retreats and finds herself in Cassandra's old room. Once more, she bursts into tears and continues her search.

When Rapunzel notices a burning candles blow out, she knows that Cassandra is nearby. She tries to reason with her, but Cassandra refuses to remind her about how Varian encased her in amber the last time they tried to sort things out. Rapunzel orders Cassandra to hand her the Moonstone, Cassandra in turn orders her to hand her the Sundrop; both refuse and begin to fight. Rapunzel breaks through Cassandra's black rocks, and they fight throughout the castle. She grabs Cassandra with her hair, and she reminds her that she was the one who educated her in combat.

Cassandra covers Rapunzel's hair in the black rocks and takes her to her room, so everyone can see Cassandra grab the Sundrop from her. Rapunzel asks what will she do after she gets the Sundrop and who or what will be left for her. Cassandra says that she doesn't need anyone and encases Rapunzel in the black rocks entirely. Rapunzel uses the Sundrop to break free, destroys her sword, and ties her up in her hair. The eclipse takes full effect and Rapunzel weakens, allowing Cassandra to overpower Rapunzel and telekinetically remove the Sundrop from her, causing Rapunzel's hair to turn brown again and lose its magical capabilities. Just then, Zhan Tiri jumps onto Cassandra and snatches the Moonstone from her, causing Cassandra to lose her powers as well. Zhan Tiri fuses both the Sundrop and the Moonstone into her wrists and transforms into her true form of a giant demon. She taunts and demoralizes Rapunzel and Cassandra, encages them both in Yellow Rocks, and sets off to destroy Corona.

While imprisoned, Cassandra breaks down in tears, feeling greatly and genuinely remorseful for her heinous actions against Rapunzel, and apologizes to the princess, admitting that she had let her rage cloud her mind and prevented her from seeing what she really needed. Rapunzel reminds Cassandra how they became friends in the first place, and the two women reconcile. While searching for a way to break out from their Yellow Rock prison, Rapunzel looks through her journal and comes across a message from her mother—"Plus Est En Vous"—which she relays to Cassandra. These words instill a new confidence in Cassandra, who gives Rapunzel a broken piece of the Moonstone from their earlier fight, which grants enough energy to Rapunzel's hair to break them out of their prison. Rapunzel then goes to confront Zhan Tiri, but is quickly outmatched. Just as Zhan Tiri is about to finish off Rapunzel, Cassandra knocks out the demon in the head with a  frying pan, having come to assist Rapunzel again to atone for her past atrocities and redeem herself. Rapunzel and Cassandra try to merge the Sundrop and the Moonstone in the unconscious demon's wrists, but Zhan Tiri recovers and breaks herself free, prompting the two girls to come up with a new strategy. They use Rapunzel's hair to lasso Zhan Tiri's arms and pull them apart, increasing the potential energy in her arms. Cassandra then tosses a Yellow Rock shard over to Rapunzel, who uses it to cut her hair, as Eugene had done years ago. Rapunzel releases her severed hair to force Zhan Tiri to unwittingly slam the Sundrop and the Moonstone in her wrists. The collision of the two opals produces an explosion that obliterates the wicked demon into nothingness and also makes the Black Rocks disintegrate as the eclipse ends.

Rapunzels reaches out for the Moonstone and the Sundrop.
Just as Rapunzel is ready to celebrate her victory over Zhan Tiri, she finds Cassandra lying on the ground, seemingly having perished in the explosion. Not wanting to lose her fully-redeemed friend, Rapunzel grabs onto the merged Sundrop-Moonstone opal and chants the Healing Incantation one last time, which revives Cassandra and everyone else who has been weakened by the demon, before sending it back into the cosmos. With peace restored to Corona, Eugene, Rapunzel, and Cassandra share a group hug.

Rapunzel finally embraces her royal destiny.
Later, Cassandra decides to leave Corona to find her own destiny. She and Rapunzel share a heartfelt hug as they bid each other farewell and acknowledge themselves as best friends once more. As the entire kingdom celebrates happily ever after following Cassandra's departure, Rapunzel finally embraces her royal destiny, becoming the queen she was destined to become.

Rapunzel and Eugene are finally engaged.
Later that evening, Eugene and Rapunzel are out on their boat where they first fell in love. Eugene mentions a promise he made to Rapunzel in Tangled: Before Ever After, which Rapunzel remembers. Having kept his promise to be patient with Rapunzel for as long as she needed and believing that they are both truly ready after everything they went through, Eugene surprises Rapunzel with a new engagement ring and proposes to her one more time, to which Rapunzel ecstatically accepts. The newly-engaged couple profess their love for one another and share a passionate kiss as the series ends.

Ralph Breaks the Internet
Rapunzel alongside Elsa and Ariel in Ralph Breaks the Internet.
In Ralph Breaks the Internet, Rapunzel appears as a netizen in Oh My Disney. She works alongside the other Disney Princesses, meeting and greeting net users as a Cast member. While visiting the site, Vanellope von Schweetz is targeted by First Order Stormtroopers. She unwittingly glitches into the backstage quarters of the Disney Princesses, who are on break; Rapunzel is seen painting the walls of her vanity. Seeing Vanellope as a threat at first, the princesses charge at her wielding weapons; Rapunzel arms herself with her frying pan. Vanellope quickly explains that she's also a princess, coming from Sugar Rush. The princesses lower their guard and question what kind of princess Vanellope is, and Rapunzel excitedly questions if Vanellope has magic hair. She and Belle also asks if Vanellope has ever been kidnapped or enslaved. She denies each question. Finally, Rapunzel asks if people assume all of Vanellope's problems are solved by a "big, strong man", which Vanellope relates to. This leads Rapunzel and the others to ecstatically declare Vanellope a princess.

Afterward, as Cinderella takes interest in Vanellope's casual modern outfit, Rapunzel agrees with her on the sentiment of wanting the same kind of attire, calling it "the best outfit ever". This leads to Cinderella's mice sewing comfy modern outfits for each of the princesses. Rapunzel wears a lilac hoodie over a purple top with a graphic that reads "The Snuggly Duckling BARHOUSE", lavender leggings patterned with the Corona sun crest, and a pair of pink sneakers with purple laces. When Ariel tries to express her joy over wearing a human shirt, she briefly breaks into song before Vanellope's confusion cuts her off. The other princesses are unfazed, explaining that they've each had songs that help express themselves. When Vanellope notes that she's never had a musical number, Rapunzel (who is sitting in a lounge cushion of her hair while eating a donut) encourages her to find her song by thinking about what she desires most and singing about whatever that may be. This leads to Vanellope performing a ditty about getting a new steering wheel for her unplugged game.

During the climax of the film, Rapunzel returns alongside the other princesses. The ladies take notice of Wreck-It Ralph plummeting from the sky. Rapunzel exclaims, "A big, strong man is in need of rescuing!", prompting the princesses to quickly rally together to save the bad guy; Rapunzel supplies her magical hair. Once the bad guy is secured, the princesses introduce themselves to Ralph and befriend him.

Live-action appearances
Once Upon a Time
Two different, yet unrelated versions of Rapunzel appear in the ABC fantasy drama series.

First Iteration
Rapunzel appeared in the 14th episode of Season 3 titled "The Tower" and was played by Alexandra Metz.

Alexandra Metz as Rapunzel in Once Upon a Time.
Before the Dark Curse was cast, Rapunzel was born as the second child to her parents, the King and Queen of an unnamed kingdom, and lives an unworried life knowing that her elder brother, instead of herself, will ascend the throne in the future. Though her parents warn Rapunzel against swimming in the stream, she disobeys them, becoming entrapped in the river, and is later saved by her brother. Tragically, her brother dies as a result, leaving Rapunzel as the next heir to the royal seat. Many years later, Rapunzel, afraid she won't live up to her parents' names, as a rule, digs up and ingests a plant called night root, which is rumored to rid the user of their fears, but it has no effect. Before leaving for home, she is chased up a tower by a cloaked witch, who refuses to allow her to ever leave. Unbeknownst to Rapunzel, the witch is a manifestation of herself as her own greatest fear, as a consequence of consuming the night root. After the curse was undone, Rapunzel notices from her tower window a man digging up night root. Since he is the first person she's seen in a long time, the princess calls to him for help. The man, Prince Charming, climbs up the tower using her long, braided hair as a scaling rope. After she tells him of her past, he promises to rescue her. When the cloaked witch climbs up the tower, she is finally unmasked as Rapunzel herself due to the effects of the night root. While Prince Charming pushes Rapunzel to fight this manifestation of her own fear, the witch throws him out of the tower. As he is clinging onto a vine, the witch begins ascending up using Rapunzel's hair. Advised by Prince Charming to fend off the fear or risk dying alone, she severs the length of her hair, causing the witch to fall and dissipate. Prince Charming helps Rapunzel out of the tower, bringing the princess to her parents, whom she happily reunites with.

Second Iteration
A different interpretation of Rapunzel appears in the seventh season, as one of the primary antagonists. Here, she is also Lady Tremaine. She is portrayed primarily by Gabrielle Anwar, and Meegan Warner in her younger form.



While Rapunzel aids an ailing husband and her two starving daughters, she stumbles upon a garden. She takes radishes, in order to help feed her family, but is confronted by Gothel, who is impressed with the selflessness the young woman displays. Rapunzel makes a deal to do "anything", in order to save them, but she has unknowingly given her freedom to the witch and is trapped within a tower, isolated. Six years pass, and Rapunzel's hair has grown to an enormous length. She uses this, as a rope to safely escape the tower, to her freedom. She follows lanterns in the sky, which were lit by her children, to commemorate the anniversary of their mother's disappearance, until she stumbles upon their new manor, and is reunited with her daughters, Anastasia and Drizella. Rapunzel finally reunites with her husband following years apart but is heartbroken to learn that he believed her to be dead, remarried, and has gained a new stepdaughter, Ella. Rapunzel tries to adjust to her new way of life, now working as a maid, and tries to reconnect with her daughters. While Anastasia is ecstatic to have her mother return in her life, Drizella, is less thrilled, lacking a bond, due to having been so young when Rapunzel left. Gothel reappears to Rapunzel and offers her a poison to give Cecelia, Marcus' new wife, but Rapunzel refuses to do so. Sometime later, it is Drizella's birthday party, and Rapunzel is working. When she overhears Drizella call Cecelia "mother", she is left enraged and places the poison into Cecelia's drink.

Anastasia follows her, and the pair both fall through. Marcus dives in and brings back a body, but Rapunzel is angered and terrified to learn it is Ella and not her daughter. Anastasia is eventually recovered, but left on the brink of death, and Rapunzel takes her to Gothel, who preserves her final breath.

Celebration of the Lost Princess
Illustration of Rapunzel and Pascal in Celebration of the Lost Princess.
After being freed from the tower and Gothel, Rapunzel, Pascal, Eugene, and Maximus begin returning to Corona to reunite with the King and Queen. However, anxiety begins overcoming the princess as she fears the life of royalty, believing it to be overbearing. As Eugene explains what palace life is like, Rapunzel's imagination gets the better of her, making the simplest of things seem too much to handle.

She also learned of the royal crown, and the symbolism its crystals held. The crown's white crystals stood for a strong, adventurous spirit; green represented gentleness and kindness; red stood for courage, and the round golden crown itself stood for leadership. Eugene further explained that the crystals perfectly represented Rapunzel, reminiscing the heroic deeds she performed during their adventure together during the original journey from the tower to the kingdom. Even so, Rapunzel felt those actions couldn't have been done without her long, magical hair, and just then, the group was attacked by bandits, who were after Maximus. Using her quick wit and physical strength, along with Maximus' assistance, the bandits were defeated, and it was revealed their leader merely needed a horse to rush his son to the doctor.

With that said, the group returned to the lead bandit's home, where Rapunzel tended to the boy's injuries. And afterward, Maximus escorted him to the medics. The entire event showed Rapunzel Eugene's words were correct, and in the end, she was finally crowned.

Ghost of Christmas Past
Illustration of Rapunzel, Eugene, Pascal, the King, and the Queen in Ghost of Christmas Past.
As Corona is preparing for the most wonderful time of the year, Rapunzel seems apprehensive about celebrating Christmas, much to the confusion of Eugene. She recalls that during the time she spent in the tower, Mother Gothel would tell her of "Nicholas the ghostly Christmas elf," who supposedly kidnaps children on Christmas Eve, and the eerie songs written in honor of the holiday. But after hearing her story, Eugene quickly realizes that the story was just another one of Mother Gothel's tricks to keep Rapunzel away from the outside world and confined in the tower. So, Eugene decides to take Rapunzel out on a stroll through the kingdom to show her what Christmas is truly all about.

First, Eugene shows her that the music is actually sweet and heartwarming, and not as spooky as she first thought. Then, the presents are real gifts, as opposed to being a trick package. Next, the so-called charms that, according to Rapunzel, scares away the Christmas elf on the Christmas tree are really ornaments used for decorations. Finally, Eugene shows her that St. Nicholas is a jolly old fellow who gives presents to kids all around the world, and not a ghostly Christmas elf who kidnaps them as she was told before. With the actual knowledge of Christmas finally given to her, Rapunzel now goes from wary to excited as she spends the next few weeks getting ready for the holiday.

On Christmas Eve, Rapunzel is finally able to celebrate the holiday with Eugene, Pascal, and her parents as it truly is: joyful, warm, and loving. Rapunzel then happily thanked Eugene and falls asleep on his lap as they wait for Christmas Day to come.

Mother Knows Best: A Tale of the Old Witch
Rapunzel has a minor role in the novel by Serena Valentino, as the main focus is the backstory of Mother Gothel. It is revealed that Gothel named her after the golden flower (which was referred to as a Rapunzel flower in the novel). At first, Rapunzel was raised in a cottage with Gothel and her housekeeper Ms. Tiddlebottom, however, when she turns eight, after Gothel and the Odd Sisters attempt to use her hair to resurrect Gothel’s sisters, Rapunzel is put into an enchanted sleep and her memories of the cottage and Ms. Tiddlebottom are erased. From that point, she is put into the tower and remains asleep until the day before her eighteenth birthday, and her happy childhood in the tower is all a dream. At the very end of the novel, Rapunzel is mourning Eugene’s death, she and Circe repeat the healing incantation at the same time, but it is unclear to Circe if Rapunzel still has some of the flower’s magic inside her.

Kingdom Keepers
She appears in the seventh book in which she Assists the Keepers during the final battle in "The Insider". She is shown to have healing powers, as seen in the movie. Rapunzel heals Violet after her force field accidentally drops debris on her, and Finn's DHI after he barely survives to kill Chernabog.

Comics

As the title New Year's Party suggests, Rapunzel and Eugene joined the royal family for a New Year Eve's party. However, as midnight approached, the couple realized they have yet to make a New Year's resolution. Rapunzel quickly decided on learning to sing, and Eugene decided on learning how to cook. However, on both ends, they were abysmal. After a while of constant lessons, Rapunzel was prepared to perform her "newfound singing skills" for Eugene, just as much as Eugene was prepared to serve Rapunzel a meal he specially cooked. However, despite their eagerness, Rapunzel found Eugene's cooking terrible and nearly choked taking a bite, whilst Eugene's reaction to her singing eventually informed her that her singing wasn't all that fantastic, and she vocally acknowledged the enlightenment. Fortunately, the two were able to see past their flaws.

After returning to the palace in Rapunzel the Princess, Rapunzel has a difficult time adjusting to the life of a princess. For instance, she's forced to wear shoes for the first time (though she eventually becomes accustomed to it), as well as being told she no longer has to sweep and clean, like she did in the tower. Eugene and the Pub Thugs also had a difficult time fitting in, using thieving mechanisms to visit Rapunzel in the castle, much to the guards' distress. She also discovers people aren't too fond of Pascal, and that painting on the wall (as she did in the tower) is considered disgraceful. However, despite her apparent mishaps, the King and Queen confess that the habits of their daughter make her special and more than desirable, believing she's the greatest princess they could ask for, no matter what.

About a decade prior to the release of Tangled, Rapunzel was given her first mention in the first issue of New Adventures of Disney's Beauty and the Beast by Disney Comics, where Belle compared her current situation of being trapped in a cellar with a bear outside to Rapunzel's situation in the story; one of the first times in which one more than one potential Princess story had been mentioned.

Rapunzel is a face character in various Disney parks around the world. Retaining long blonde hair as opposed to the short, brown cut at the end of the film, the official explanation for her park appearance is that the remnants of the magic within her after healing Flynn have gradually allowed her to grow some hair back (down to her ankles it seems).

Amongst the other guests included thousands of fans, the other (then nine) official members of the Disney Princess Royal Court, and Flynn Rider, who had the honor of crowning Rapunzel.

Redesign
In contrast to some other Princesses, Rapunzel received very few changes for the "deluxe princess" redesign in 2012. Her dress simply had glittery floral designs added onto it. The dress is also a little longer, extending to floor-length and the colors seem to be brightened. Rapunzel's hair is long and blonde, reaching floor-length despite the fact that it was cut in the film. Rapunzel has also been given shoes for her redesign, something that differs greatly from the film, where she is consistently barefoot. Her design also remained almost the same after the 2021 'Ultimate Princess Celebration' redesign.

Palace Pets
Rapunzel's Palace Pets are Blondie, Summer, Meadow, Daisy, Gleam, Sundrop, Truffles, and Cubbie.

Differences from the source material
Although Rapunzel is based on the character from the classic fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm, she is altered quite a bit in order to develop a more adventurous and outgoing personality, and further complicate the romantic relationship between her and her love interest.

In the original tale, Rapunzel is named after the Rapunzel (German) plant, known as corn salad or lamb's lettuce in English. Her mother had craved them during the pregnancy and her father had stolen them from Gothel's garden, which is why she claimed ownership of Rapunzel in the fairy tale.
Some versions say that Rapunzel's hair was just long while others say it was always braided in a plait. However, in the film, she has both styles.</p></html>
