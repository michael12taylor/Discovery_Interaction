Queen Anna of Arendelle (pronounced "AH-na") is the protagonist of Disney's 2013 animated feature film Frozen and the deuteragonist of its 2019 sequel. She is the second-born daughter of King Agnarr and Queen Iduna, the younger sister of Elsa the Snow Queen, and the contemporary ruler of Arendelle. During their childhood, an accident involving Elsa's magic created a rift between the two sisters, leaving Anna devoid of love for many years. Despite this, Anna remained big-hearted and optimistic, albeit socially awkward. When their estrangement incidentally triggers an eternal winter, Anna embarks on a perilous journey to save her kingdom and mend the broken bond between herself and her sister.

Three years after her adventure, a rekindled Anna and Elsa embark on another journey to confront the elemental spirits of the Enchanted Forest. Upon their journey's end, Elsa chooses to remain in the forest as the fifth spirit, so she abdicates the throne, allowing Anna to be crowned Queen of Arendelle.

Anna is loosely based on Gerda, the female protagonist of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale "The Snow Queen".

Development
A model of one of Anna's earlier designs by Chad Stubblefield.
In the earlier stages of the film's production, Anna's role was vastly different from that of the final project. Instead of being a princess, Anna was a peasant on a quest to have the Snow Queen help free her frozen heart. Not only that, she was of no relation to Elsa in these stages of the film's production. The filmmakers struggled to find the movie's heart through this version, finding it difficult to have a believable and engaging relationship between the two female leads when they truly have nothing to do with one another. However, one of the filmmakers suggested the two be made siblings, and things quickly changed from there. Anna was made a princess, as well as Elsa, who, in turn, went from a villain to a misunderstood heroine.

With these changes, the characters and story were viewed in a more relatable light, as Anna's main goal was to now win the acceptance and love of her older sister; something to which her voice actress Kristen Bell personally related.

Notably, as seen in early animation footage, Anna wasn't always as daring and fearless as she is in the film. In the early test animation for the Marshmallow chase scene, Anna was seen reluctant when diving off the cliff with Kristoff, only doing so at the fear of Marshmallow attacking. However, in the film, this isn't the case, and Anna is seen with immense excitement, engulfing herself in the thrill of the moment.

One of Anna's early designs by Chad Stubblefield (pictured here on the page) revealed that Anna was originally planned to have platinum blonde hair but was changed to strawberry-blonde.

Voice
Anna's voice actress, Kristen Bell, served as one of the prime inspirations for the character. The filmmakers, as well as Bell, wanted a heroine different from the trademark princesses of Cinderella and Belle; one who was clumsy, socially awkward, and constantly spoke before she thought. Anna's supervising animator, Becky Bresee, noted she took much of Anna's animated movement from Bell's facial expressions and rhythm when she recorded the lines.

Personality
Unlike her older sister Elsa, Anna is optimistic, energetic, awkward, perky, and generally far from elegant. She is also free-spirited, and has garnered an extrovert mentality after years of living within the confines of the castle gates without her sister's company. As a result, she is quick to make friends and craves affection and companionship, though this serves as potentially her greatest flaw, as she can sometimes be too trusting towards strangers - an issue brought to attention with the introduction of the malevolent Prince Hans.

Anna's most valued asset and the true object of her affection is her relationship with her sister. Since childhood, Anna has been attached to Elsa and greatly admired her abilities, to which she saw as unique. Throughout most of the film, Anna is also the only individual to express faith that Elsa was not a monster. This is in contrast to the Duke of Weselton, Kristoff, as well as the entirety of Arendelle's populace, who were all notably skeptical towards Elsa's benevolence, and feared at what she was capable of. Against all these odds, however, Anna remained hopeful, and fiercely assured that Elsa's true nature was gentle and caring; so much so, that she willingly threw herself into the dangerous terrains of the mountains to retrieve her sister from exile, only armed with the belief that the strength of their bond would be enough to motivate Elsa to return, which is example of Anna's powerful sense of hope and optimism. Anna relies on these traits to carry her through her hardships, and though she still faces overwhelming struggle, her buoyant mentality ultimately led to the restoration of both her kingdom's welfare, and the relationship with her sister.

It should be noted that despite her optimism, Anna also struggles with her self-confidence on occasion. The lack of explanation regarding her forced separation from Elsa would lead Anna to believe that she was the issue, and that Elsa simply wanted nothing to do with her. As time would go on, she would begin to fall into a state of mind that manifested itself into a need for love and companionship that would cause her trouble with Prince Hans. This would also explain why she is so quick to find romance, as "For the First Time in Forever" shows that she's looking for someone to act as her companion, no longer wanting to be alone. She also makes remarks such as "It's just me" and "No, I'm completely ordinary", which also indicates her low opinion of herself.

Anna also tends to act before she thinks, and can be rather impulsive and quick-tempered at times, which causes quite a bit of trouble. Throughout the film, she made several imprudent decisions as a result of this trait, such as accepting Hans' suspiciously hasty marriage proposal despite barely knowing him and provoking the beastly Marshmallow despite his ferocious size and power grossly outweighing her own. She can also be quite stubborn as she initially refused to accept the possibility that Hans was not her true love, despite the valid criticisms regarding the idea from Elsa and Kristoff, only coming to realize the truth once Olaf points out about how she has no idea on what true love is as well as how Kristoff really loves her when she is almost dying near the end of the first film. Furthermore, she repeatedly went against Kristoff's advisement (such as letting him face a pack of wolves alone while she remained out of harm) throughout their adventure. Balancing this out is the fact that Anna is fearless, intelligent, quick-thinking, good in a crisis and highly skilled in self-defense, allowing her to overcome various challenges, including those caused by her own lack of impulse control. She held her own against Marshmallow (despite their difference in assets), a pack of wolves, and was solely responsible for the downfall of Hans.

In the end, despite her flaws, Anna is an extremely sweet, selfless, and loving character. Numerous times throughout the film, she puts the safety and well-being of others before her own, showing great loyalty and admiration for her friends and family. Though clumsy and comical, she has a strong sense of purity and heart, as well as fearlessness and good judgment in a crisis, which ultimately aids her in overcoming obstacles.

Frozen Fever shows a much more mature side of Anna's personality. While excited over celebrating her birthday with Elsa, she spends the day more worried over Elsa's health and pushes her to rest, caring more about Elsa's health than her birthday highlighting her selflessness, especially after her sister almost falls off the clock tower. She also assures Elsa that she hasn't ruined her birthday, but also states that taking care of Elsa is the "best birthday present ever".

In Olaf's Frozen Adventure, Anna shows concern when Elsa feels bad about not having a holiday tradition and searches for one, which she finds in the attic. She takes charge and orders everyone to gather for a search and rescue when Olaf goes missing, demonstrating her leadership skills. Anna was also realized that her and Elsa's childhood memories of creating Olaf were her family's traditions as Anna kept giving Elsa Christmas gifts based on Olaf which reminded her and Anna of their happy childhood and how much they still loved each other. This allowed Anna to accept that having the family and friends she has made as the greatest gift she's ever received.

In Frozen II, Anna has shown to be a little more mature, though she still retains some aspects of her personality. She finds happiness in no longer being alone, having her sister back as well as Olaf, Sven, Kristoff, and the gates open. Although no longer  rash and impulsive, she is also shown in wanting to connect more with her fellow Arendellians. Anna has also become very protective of Elsa, loving her life the way it is and not wanting to lose her sister again. She insists on accompanying Elsa through her journey and tries persuading her against too many dangerous choices, indirectly pushing Kristoff away in the process, something she realizes and apologizes to him for later. After the apparent 'deaths' of Elsa and Olaf, Anna breaks down since she is rendered virtually alone again, but she manages to pull herself together to fulfill Elsa's wish and destroy their grandfather's dam to lift the curse on the Enchanted Forest. She subsequently shows great leadership qualities in leading her fellow Arendellian soldiers in provoking the Earth Giants to destroy the dam, something which the forest's spirits recognize and consequently allow Arendelle to stand because of Anna doing what was right for everyone. They and Elsa acknowledge Anna as a great and noble leader, also allowing Elsa to recognize that Anna is the best person to be queen of Arendelle. After Elsa's return, the resurrection of Olaf, and her engagement to Kristoff, Anna accepts that it's okay for her and her sister to separate so long as they maintain contact with one another. In the three years since the first movie, Anna has fully grown up as she becomes a responsible and cheerful queen who continues to look after the needs of Arendelle.

Physical appearance
At 18 years of age during the original film and 21 during Frozen II, Anna has a slender build and fair skin. She has turquoise-blue eyes, rosy cheeks, thin pink lips, a small nose, long strawberry-blonde hair, mostly tied into two braided pigtails, bangs down her forehead, and a light dusting of freckles (a trait that she shares with her sister Elsa, although due to being slightly older, Elsa appears to have fewer freckles than Anna); her face is also slightly rounder than Elsa's. When she wears sleeveless dresses, it is shown that she has some freckles on her shoulders in addition to the ones on her face. She has a platinum-blonde streak on the right side of her hair due to an accident in which she was struck by Elsa's magic during childhood. The platinum-blonde streak remained for years until the curse on Anna's frozen heart was broken and the streak was removed along with it.

All of her outfits have rosemaling, reflecting the movie's Norwegian setting.

In her coronation dress, Anna wears a black sweetheart bodice with dark green off-the-shoulder straps and rose, teal, blue, and purple prints on it, and has greenish-gold trim, a black satin-laced necklace with a bronze pendant of Arendelle's symbol, an olive drab pleated skirt with sashes consisting of the following: asparagus centers with pink, crimson, dark olive green, olive drab, and blueprints on it between cream sides and dark green pleats, both cream petticoat and frilly knee-length pantalettes, white stockings, and a pair of black ballet shoes. She wears her hair in a bun, and a part of her hair is braided and used as a headband, a green comb-shaped barrette with a couple of satin ribbons green and chartreuse attached to the back of her hair, and dark pink lipstick. She also wears a teal cape with a cyan bow as a clasp for the cape, a sapphire oval-cut hem with an azure line, blue dots on each cut, and small sapphire dots all around the cape.

The winter outfit that Anna acquires at Wandering Oaken's Trading Post and Sauna is a traditional Norwegian clothing called "Bunad". The design consists of a medium-length, dark blue skirt consisting of a lavender round-cut lining with points, with each rose and periwinkle print similar to a rose around the skirt on each point, and each periwinkle bush-like print on each of its round edges with a black bodice with gold trim and green, red, yellow, and purple rose prints on it, a light blue long-sleeved blouse, and black heeled leather boots with gold linings and magenta soles. She also wears a magenta bonnet with purple lining, lavender fluff, and matching white print on the back, a pair of blue mittens with navy blue palms, and a detachable magenta cape with a matching cap, purple linings, and small Byzantium tassels on the edge of the cape with a silver brooch consisting of a pair of hearts with gray prints attached to her cape and magenta lipstick. On occasion, she wears a pair of crystal clear ice skates.

After Anna's heart is frozen, her hair turns silvery-white. When she is thawed out, her hair returns to its original state without the platinum blonde streak.

In Anna's summer attire, her hair is once again braided in pigtails without her streak. She wears a timber wolf wrist-length blouse with light blue vertical linings, a pinafore dress consisting of both a light gray bodice with green linings, vertical gray hairlines, and four green buttons placed vertically on the bodice with black hairline laces attached, a dark gray skirt with a light gray lining, crimson, green, and lavender flower prints all around on it, and lavender, green, and olive drab bush-like prints between each flower prints. She also dons a white petticoat, a pair of matching heeled leather boots with gold linings and brown soles, the same color and shape of the brooch, and on occasion, the same color ice skates.

In Frozen Fever, Anna wears her hair a bun but with a yellow sunflower and three ribbons hanging down (in the colors of dark green, light green, and teal) in the back. She wears a navy blue bodice which has olive, crimson, green, and orange prints on the front with copper linings, and a light chartreuse short-sleeved blouse that has a pink and gold brooch in the middle that turns purple and gold later on. On top of this, Anna wears an apple-green sleeveless cropped gilet with teal, dark green, brown, orange, and chartreuse rosemaling on the front and back. She wears a teal skirt with yellow, olive, and brown sunflower prints with darker teal stalks and leaves with smaller olive, dark teal, and purple designs between each sunflower, and a small dark teal leaf design on the left, middle part of the skirt. Above the sunflower is a wavy looping yellow line with light teal dots above each loop. She wears light olive stockings, pale olive-yellow petticoats, black ballet flats, a friendship bracelet, and dark pink lipstick. Elsa used her powers to change this dress by adding sunflowers to her bun and skirt using crystalline ice and creating a hidden ice petticoat to make the skirt more voluminous.

In Olaf's Frozen Adventure, Anna wears her hair in a bun for the majority of the special, but reverts to her standard braids when she and Elsa are leading the search for Olaf. Her attire is comprised of a sky blue dress with bells and goats patterned motif around the hemline, using the same fabric as the tablecloths in the ballroom.

At the beginning of the sequel, Anna wears a beige gown with kitten heels. Her hair is tied up in a bun with a piece of wheat on the side. Her hair is in her usual braids, and she wears a lime green nightgown when playing charades with Elsa, Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven. During their travels to the Enchanted Forest, Anna wears a purple and magenta long vest and a black long-sleeved dress with gold trim, a brown belt around her waist, and gold pants underneath. She accessorizes with long black boots and a gold cross pendant. She later removes the vest during her travels in the cavern and luring the Earth Giants to destroy the dam.

As Queen of Arendelle, Anna wears her hair in a bun similar to that of her mother and Elsa when she was crowned queen in the first film and wears a black shirt with buttons to close it, a tropical rain forest dress with mint green trim, and a teal cape with a purple underside. She also wears a tiara similar to the one her sister wore.

Abilities
Unlike Elsa, Anna was born without magic and lacks any sort of enchanted abilities; she relies solely on fearlessness and optimism to guide her through perilous situations. According to directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, Anna's "super power" is the strength and purity of her loving heart. Because the love she harbored for her sister was so powerful, Anna managed to successfully navigate through a death-defying journey through the Norwegian wilderness, facing off against cursed weather conditions, supernatural beings, and the elements of nature, itself. It was her devotion towards Elsa, and refusal to view the latter as a villain, that would ultimately lead to the resurrection of their familial bond, Elsa's total control of her powers through love, and the salvation of the kingdom of Arendelle.

Quite notably, however, Anna has exhibited examples of above-average physical strength and has proven herself to be quite powerful in this regard; she doesn't seem to notice, as she has accidentally caused physical pain to characters such as Kristoff (when she nonchalantly threw a bag of carrots to the mountain man, but with far more force than intended) and Olaf (when she made an attempt to gently insert his carrot nose onto his face, only to jab it in forcefully and giving the snowman a "head rush" by mistake) as a result of underestimating her own strength. During "For the First Time in Forever", she was seen dancing with and subsequently flinging a bust with ease. During a wolf attack, she held her own, using Kristoff's lute to smack one of the wolves away from the sled - which had brutal results for the wolf. The most noteworthy example of Anna's physical capacity is perhaps following the film's climax, where the princess punched the traitorous Prince Hans off a ship, with a substantial amount of force strong enough to send the prince flying off of his feet.

In addition to her physical strength, Anna is also shown to be very fast and agile. During "The Next Right Thing", Anna was able to leap from separate ledges several feet apart. She was also able to outmaneuver the Earth Giants, although she was nearly crushed before being rescued by Kristoff. While in the first movie Anna had difficulty climbing she was shown to be able to climb well in the sequel.

Anna also has an incredible amount of endurance in harsh winter conditions, as she was able to navigate through post-blizzard terrains with a simple cloak and ball gown for over twenty-four hours or so, without too much negative effect other than some initial discomfort towards the unexpected cold. Following the purchase of her winter gear, she seemed entirely unaffected by the weather and only fell into the danger of freezing to death due to the frozen curse accidentally placed upon her heart by Elsa in the midst of her journey, as its power froze the princess from the inside out. As a young child, she was also unaffected by the snow figures she and Elsa played with in the enchanted forest she made with her ice magic (barefoot, no less).

Appearances
Frozen
Young Anna and Elsa enjoying themselves in Elsa's snowy wonderland.
At a young age, at Anna's behest, she and Elsa would spend much of their time using the latter's powers for their own enjoyment, against their parents' wishes. One night, five-year-old Anna suggests they build a snowman, to which eight-year-old Elsa agrees. The sisters head into the castle's throne room and create a winter field of snow. During their playdate, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna in the head with her magic, rendering her unconscious and turning a streak of her hair platinum blonde. Horrified, Elsa calls their parents, King Agnarr and Queen Iduna, for help. Iduna and Agnarr travel with their daughters to the Valley of the Living Rock, where they request the assistance of magical trolls led by a shaman named Pabbie. Pabbie is able to save Anna by cleansing her body of all magic, including memories of magic. Though this leaves Anna with no recollection of Elsa's powers, Agnarr declares that it's for the best.

"Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"
Pabbie advises that the royal family take precaution with Elsa's powers as they can be extremely dangerous if not controlled. For the safety of his daughters and people, Agnarr forces Elsa into isolation by closing off the castle and separating her from Anna, who remains oblivious as to why life in the castle has changed. Over the years, Anna makes repeated attempts to reach out to Elsa, but to no avail. To keep herself occupied in spite of her loneliness, Anna would spend most of her time running through the castle halls and talking to paintings. During Anna and Elsa's teenage years, Agnarr and Iduna lost their lives at sea when their ship was struck by monstrous waves. The news devastated Anna, who attended her parents' funeral alone. With no family left besides her sister, Anna made another attempt to reconnect with Elsa to no response. With Elsa refusing to leave her room due to the instability of her powers, both sisters were forced to cope with the loss of their parents, alone.

"For the First Time in Forever"
Three years later, Elsa had finally come of age and is ready to be crowned Queen of Arendelle. To celebrate the occasion, the windows, doors, and gates of the castle were opened for the first time in years. Foreign dignitaries are also invited to the festivities, with such kingdoms as the Southern Isles and Weselton sending representatives in honor of their countries. An excited 18-year-old Anna sees this as an opportunity to explore the outside world and find the companionship she has been devoid of for years, preferably, in the form of "true love." The second the gates are finally opened, Anna rushes out and explores her kingdom, roaming about the streets and catching glimpse of all the visitors. Suddenly, she bumps into a horse owned by the dashing Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Though initially angered by the clumsiness of the stranger, Anna quickly becomes smitten with Hans's charm and good looks. After introducing themselves, Anna and Hans become acquainted, and apparently hit it off, only to be interrupted by the coronation bells.

Anna and Elsa at the coronation ball.
At the chapel, Anna stands by her sister's side during the crowning (where she shares a cute wave with Hans). Afterwards, a ball is held in honor of the new queen. Anna and Elsa stand side by side in the ballroom, watching over the crowd. To Anna's surprise and delight, Elsa initiates a conversation, allowing the sisters to bond for the first time in years. They are interrupted by their steward Kai, who introduces the snide Duke of Weselton. When the Duke offers Elsa her first dance as queen, Elsa mischievously volunteers Anna instead. Anna is dragged onto the dance floor, where she is subjected to the Duke's over-the-top dance skills, much to Elsa's amusement. Afterwards, Anna and Elsa laugh about the matter, with Anna openly wishing their lives could always be carefree. With regret, Elsa declares that it cannot, but refuses to explain why. Feeling rejected, Anna excuses herself from the party.

Anna looking in confusion and shock as Elsa flees the ballroom as a result of her powers being revealed.
As she walks off, Anna bumps into Hans once again, who takes the princess out on a romantic date around the city. Anna falls in love with Hans, and the night ends with a proposal from Hans. Anna immediately agrees, and the newly engaged couple return to the ballroom to ask for Elsa's blessing. Elsa refuses, telling Anna that she can't marry a stranger. This leads to a heated argument between the sisters, which climaxes with Anna questioning why Elsa coldly shuts out her family and the world. Anna's prying triggers Elsa's anxieties, causing the queen to inadvertently unleash her powers upon Anna and their guests. Horrified by what she's done, Elsa flees the ballroom. Despite her confusion, Anna follows behind in an attempt to stop her sister. Elsa escapes into the fjords and unknowingly places a curse that traps Arendelle in an eternal winter. As snow flurries fill the sky, the Duke of Weselton goes into a panic, exclaiming that Elsa must be apprehended. Claiming responsibility for Elsa's departure and the curse, Anna makes it her mission to find Elsa and save the kingdom. With Hans in charge in her absence, Anna leaves the castle on horseback, searching for her sister.

Anna meeting Kristoff (not exactly love at first sight).
Hours later, Anna loses her horse in the middle of the woods and accidentally ruins her clothes by falling into freezing water. Fortunately, she stumbles upon a humble establishment owned by the equally humble Oaken, who happens to have one winter outfit in stock. Just as she's about to purchase her new outfit, a rugged mountain man named Kristoff arrives and tells Oaken that the source of the harsh weather is the North Mountain. Anna deduces that Elsa is somewhere along the North Mountain, but before she can get more information, Kristoff is booted from the shop for insulting Oaken. Anna pays for Kristoff's unpaid gear to coerce the mountain man into guiding her to the North Mountain. Though reluctant at first, Kristoff eventually agrees his reindeer. Anna loads up with Kristoff and his reindeer sidekick, Sven, and the trio embark on their quest to find Elsa that same night.

Meeting Olaf the Snowman.
Along the way, Kristoff inquires Elsa's reasoning for covering the land in eternal winter, and Anna explains the situation with Hans. The cynical Kristoff calls Anna out, finding it ridiculous that she became engaged to someone she met that day. Before their conversation continues, however, the trio are attacked by savage wolves. Fortunately, they're able to escape the pack, but the only bit of cargo to make it out of the chaos are Sven's carrots. Kristoff's sled, and most of everything in it was destroyed. Feeling guilty, Anna offers him a new sled and gear, and allows him to return home if he so chooses. Knowing Anna would die on her own, Kristoff and Sven choose to stick by her side, much to Anna's relief. By the time morning hits, Kristoff starts to doubt Elsa's morality, but Anna remains confident that Elsa will end the winter. Upon entering a grove, they encounter an enchanted snowman created by Elsa. Anna is initially terrified, but simmers down upon realizing that he's harmless. The snowman introduces himself as Olaf, the same snowman that Anna and Elsa built as kids. He explains that Elsa brought him to life and that he knows her whereabouts: an ice palace.

Anna in agony after her heart's accidentally been frozen by Elsa.
Upon arriving at the palace, Anna is stunned by the sheer beauty of Elsa's powers. Wanting alone time with her sister, Anna advises Kristoff and Olaf to wait outside before anxiously entering the palace. Inside, Anna apologizes for the coronation incident and asks Elsa to return home. Believing her people are safer without her, Elsa refuses and encourages Anna to return to Arendelle, where she can enjoy the sun and open gates. To that, Anna reveals that Arendelle is trapped in an enteral winter caused by Elsa's magic. Despite Anna's confidence that they can solve the problem together, Elsa goes into another panic attack and loses control of her powers. She accidentally strikes Anna once again, but this time, in the heart. With neither sister realizing the danger, Anna continues with her persistence, but Elsa remains firm on her decision and orders Anna to leave for her own safety. When Anna refuses, Elsa creates a hulking snowman to remove Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf from the palace.

Anna and Kristoff's meeting with Pabbie.
The snow monster (named Marshmallow by Olaf) chases the friends out and away from the palace, warning them not to come back. After reaching safety, Anna's hair begins to turn white, and Kristoff deduces the cause to be Elsa's magic. Kristoff leads the gang to the Valley of the Living Rock, to seek aid from the trolls. Kristoff's adoptive mother, Bulda, assumes Anna to be her son's girlfriend; when the two deny any romance, Bulda and the trolls try to convince them otherwise, going as far as to set up a troll wedding. Before things go any further, Anna loses balance as the curse becomes stronger. They learn from Pabbie that Anna was struck in the heart by Elsa and can only be saved by "an act of true love." Should she fail, Anna will turn to solid ice and die. Bulda believes the "act of true love" would be "a true love's kiss." With this in mind, Kristoff escorts Anna back to Arendelle to receive a kiss from Hans. Meanwhile, Hans fears that Anna has been away for too long and might be in trouble. Under his command, a search party is set out. Though they fail to find Anna, Hans and his army are able to apprehend Elsa and take her back to Arendelle as a prisoner.

Later, Anna and her friends arrive in the kingdom. Kristoff leaves Anna in the care of the castle servants and accepts that she no longer needs him. Inside the castle, Anna reunites with Hans and hastily warns him of Elsa's curse. She pleads for a "true love's kiss", but Hans refuses, revealing that he never really loved Anna. While extinguishing all the warmth in the room to quicken Anna's death, Hans explains that his real desire was to marry into the throne and become king of Arendelle. Now, Hans plots to use Anna's impending death to prosecute Elsa and sentence her to execution. Anna tries to stop him, but Hans locks her inside the room and leaves her to die. Afterward, Hans announces Anna's death at the hands of Queen Elsa. He also claims that he and Anna married just before she died in his arms, leaving Arendelle in his hands. With Hans in control of the throne, Elsa is charged with treason and sentenced to death. Before the execution can be carried out, Elsa escapes her cell. Her anxieties trigger a whiteout that encapsulates all of Arendelle and threatens to destroy the castle. Kristoff and Sven notice the storm from a distance and rush back to the kingdom to save Anna.

Anna's frozen body.
Back in the castle, Anna is found by Olaf, who quickly lights a fire to keep Anna alive. Olaf contemplates their next step, but a crestfallen Anna loses hope as she doesn't even know what love is. Olaf explains that love is "putting someone else's needs before yours." He uses Kristoff as an example, revealing that the mountain man is in love with Anna. Reinvigorated, Anna uses her remaining strength to escape the castle to find Kristoff, while her home is overtaken by Elsa's storm. With Olaf's help, Anna makes it into the fjord, but the curse only worsens the farther she goes. Not too far away, Hans confronts Elsa. He reveals that Anna died of a frozen heart despite his "efforts" to save her and places the blame on Elsa. Devastated, Elsa breaks down in tears, which ends the whiteout. No longer blinded by the blizzard, Anna and Kristoff finally spot each other. As Anna slowly makes her way towards Kristoff, she hears a sword being drawn a short distance away. In horror, she realizes that Hans is preparing to kill Elsa. After one last look at Kristoff, Anna sacrifices herself by lunging between Elsa and Hans and blocking the latter's blow just as her body freezes solid, killing her. The shockwave caused by her curse knocks Hans off his feet.

Anna and Elsa's embrace, following Anna's revival.
Upon seeing her sister's lifeless body, Elsa breaks down in tears. Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven arrive shortly afterward and mourn the loss of the princess, as Arendelle's onlooking populace does the same. Fortunately, Anna's sacrifice for Elsa has constituted an act of true love, thus breaking her curse and thawing her frozen heart. Anna and Elsa embrace and profess their love for each other. With help from Olaf, Elsa comes to realize that love is the key to controlling her powers. As Anna watches in amazement, Elsa frees Arendelle from its eternal winter, effectively restoring peace to the kingdom. Hans, meanwhile, regains consciousness and is shocked to find Anna alive. Anna calmly confronts him before fiercely punching him in the face and knocking him into the fjord. Anna and Elsa share another hug, and as the sisters embrace, Anna looks lovingly to Kristoff, showing that she reciprocates his romantic affections.

"I like the open gates."
Following these events, Elsa reclaims her position as queen. Under her command, Hans and the Duke of Weselton are deported, while Kristoff is dubbed the "Official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer". Anna also buys Kristoff a new sled and presents it to him as a surprise (with help from Sven). Kristoff is delighted to the point of wanting to kiss Anna, though he quickly regrets admitting as much. Anna nevertheless accepts, and the two cement their relationship by sharing their first kiss. At the castle courtyard, Elsa permanently reopens the castle gates and invites her subjects to enjoy a newly-created ice skating rink. Anna joins in the festivities and is touched by Elsa's vow to never close the gates again. Joined by Olaf, Kristoff, Sven, the sisters indulge in a kingdom-wide celebration honoring their reunion and a new era for Arendelle.

Frozen Fever

It is Anna's 19th birthday in the animated short, and Elsa has plans to make it absolutely perfect in hopes of rectifying the hardened past the sisters were forced to endure. Within the castle, Anna oversleeps but is soon awakened by an elated Elsa. Explaining her plans to make her sister's birthday an enjoyable, memorable one, Elsa bestows her first gift; a new dress, embodying the bright, colorful aura of spring. Once fully dressed, Elsa leads Anna throughout the castle and kingdom, following a trail of string with various checkpoints leading to several gifts: a clock, flowers, a bracelet, a fishing pole, and more. As Anna happily follows her elder sister, she notices her sneezing and sniffling and takes note that medical attention is in need of providing. Nevertheless, Elsa assures her she's fine, and the day continues.

With time, however, Elsa falls into a delirious haze. After leading Anna to the top of the city's clock tower at the end of the string, Elsa nearly falls off the ledge, only to be rescued by Anna, who decides to put the day on hold in order to care for her sister.

With Elsa finally admitting she has a cold, the sisters return to the castle as Elsa apologizes to Anna for ruining her perfect birthday, to which Anna assures that Elsa didn't ruin it, and she just needs to rest in bed. They then enter through the castle gates, only to find Olaf, Kristoff, Sven, and several citizens, as well as miniature baby snowmen, within the courtyard and announcing a surprise party. Ecstatic, Anna is greeted by her guests and receives her birthday cake from a loving Kristoff.

Following a spectacular birthday celebration, Anna helps Elsa to bed and thanks her for the most wonderful day and the best birthday present she could ever ask for which is Elsa letting her take care of her.

Olaf's Frozen Adventure
Anna in Olaf's Frozen Adventure.
In the featurette, it is the first holiday season after the castle gates have reopened. To commemorate the occasion and "ring in the season", Anna and Elsa plan a surprise Christmas party for Arendelle's people, though the two sisters soon come to realize that their own family lacks traditions. Olaf, meanwhile, makes it his mission to find a holiday tradition for the sisters to share. Anna searches the attic for some traditions and finds a box full of gifts she gave Elsa during their years of separation. When Olaf goes missing, her sister Elsa orders the citizens of Arendelle to conduct a search party and aids in the search. Olaf is found and Anna admits that they had a tradition all along, which was the gifts inside the box. The sisters both treasured the artwork because it reminded them of their childhood and of how much they loved each other, leading Olaf to realize that he is their tradition. Later, Elsa uses her magic to create a sparkling ice Christmas tree and decorates it with lanterns from the search party. Elsa and Anna are happy and grateful to be with family and friends. Elsa looks around and thinks Arendelle has a new tradition, to which Anna agrees and thanks Olaf for the help.

Ralph Breaks the Internet
Anna with Pocahontas and Moana in Ralph Breaks the Internet.
In Ralph Breaks the Internet, Anna is a netizen who lives and works in Oh My Disney as a cast member where she and the other Disney princesses meet and greet their fans. When Vanellope glitches into the princesses' dressing room to hide from the First Order Stormtroopers, Anna is seen talking with Elsa and Moana. When the princesses mistake Vanellope for a threat, they charge at her with various weapons; Anna is the only princess shown without a weapon, instead opting to use her fists (a reference to when she punched Hans). Vanellope explains that she is also a princess, which surprises Anna and prompts Pocahontas to ask what kind of princess she is. Anna, Mulan, Merida, and Moana are the only ones who do not ask Vanellope a question. When Jasmine asks Vanellope if she has "daddy issues", she notes that she does not have a mom, to which Anna and Elsa relate.

After declaring Vanellope an official princess they admire her "gown" and change into comfortable modern clothes. Anna wears a green flannel shirt with a black top with a graphic of a sandwich which reads "FINISH EACH OTHER'S", blue jean shorts, and black-and-white sneakers and is seen lounging next to Tiana while eating a bag of potato chips. Before Vanellope leaves, Merida tries to give her advice in an unintelligible Scottish accent which confuses Vanellope, and she asks the princesses what Merida said and they explain that they cannot understand Merida with Anna adding that she is from "the other studio".

In the climax of the film, Anna and the princesses witness Ralph about to fall to his death from the Google tower and work together to save him. Anna and Cinderella help Jaq and Gus sew two of the princesses' discarded dresses to Rapunzel's magic hair to use as parachutes. After Ralph is saved, the princesses introduce themselves as friends of Vanellope and befriend Ralph as well.

In this film, Anna still retains the platinum-blonde streak on the right side of her hair as seen at the start of the original Frozen film.

Frozen II
Anna happy with her life.
Three years after her adventures in the mountains, the now 21-year-old Anna is happier than ever with her now peaceful life in Arendelle. With the gates open, and Elsa, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf by her side, Anna feels that she is no longer alone. Despite the positivity, Anna notices a dwindle in Elsa's mood. Anna is seemingly able to comfort her sister, but some time later, she is awakened by an assault on the kingdom, led by the four elements of earth, wind, fire, and water. The sisters evacuate their subjects to the cliffs as Arendelle is stripped of its resources, where Elsa confesses that she awakened the spirits of the Enchanted Forest because of a mysterious voice that's been calling to her. Anna confronts her sister on keeping secrets again, but she nevertheless trusts Elsa's hunch that the voice is calling for a good reason.

Anna vows to protect Elsa at all costs.
Grand Pabbie soon arrives with his rock trolls, and informs the sisters that the spirits are upset due to a past offense. Elsa determines that she must find the voice in order to save her kingdom, but Anna insists on tagging along. Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven do as well, much to Elsa's frustration. Before they depart, Grand Pabbie voices his concern for Elsa, but Anna ensures that she won't let anything happen to her sister. Pabbie also assures that he will watch over the people of Arendelle until Elsa and Anna return from pacifying the spirits and ending their rage.

The party embarks on their journey to the Enchanted Forest, and along the way, Kristoff awkwardly tries to propose to Anna. Anna mistakes Kristoff's fumbling for rejection, but before they can talk any further, they arrive at the forest. Before entering, Elsa promises that the sisters will accomplish the mission together, per Anna's request.

Soon after entering the Enchanted Forest, the group is ambushed by the wind spirit, Gale, in the form of a tornado. After Elsa uses her powers to save Anna from being hit by flying debris, the wind spirit focuses on her and expels the others. Elsa is able to quell the wind spirit (whom Olaf names Gale), and the result of combining their powers creates several sculptures of the past because "water has memory".

Shortly afterwards the group runs into the Arendelle Royal Guards and the Northuldra tribe led by Yelana who are still at war with each other and blame the other for the fight leading to their imprisonments. After Anna unintentionally points an ice sword made from one of the statues at a familiar looking soldier, Elsa uses her powers to keep the two groups from attacking them. After recovering from their shock, Olaf recaps the first movie and recent events before Anna recognizes the Arendellians' leader as Lieutenant Mattias, King Agnarr's former bodyguard.

The site is soon attacked by the Fire Spirit, and Elsa uses her powers to put out its flames (and saves Anna from suffocating after she runs into the flames). Elsa tames the spirit, an agitated fire salamander, and names it "Bruni". After the Northundra recognize their mother's scarf as Northuldra, the two princesses realize their mother was the Northuldran girl who saved their father's life, ceasing conflict between the two groups and Elsa promises to find the truth of the past and free the forest, despite Anna's concern at how big that promise is that Elsa needs to keep.
