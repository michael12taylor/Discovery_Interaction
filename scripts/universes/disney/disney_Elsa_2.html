<html><p>Sometime later, a shackled Elsa awakens within the castle dungeon, where she is able to witness Arendelle's eternal winter firsthand from the cell's only window. She then receives a visit from Hans, who claims to be protecting her. Hans pleads for Elsa to end the curse, but she lacks the power to do so and instead demands that she be released for Arendelle's safety. Hans claims that he'll "do what he can" and leaves the cell. Afterward, Anna finally returns to Arendelle and warns Hans about the curse placed upon her by Elsa. Wanting to usurp the throne as king, Hans refuses to save Anna so that he can charge Elsa for treason and sentence her to death. Before the guards can carry out the execution, Elsa uses her powers to destroy her chains and her cell, thus allowing her to escape. However, due to the instability of her powers, this also triggers a snowstorm that threatens to destroy Arendelle. Furious, Hans gathers his sword and sets out to kill the Snow Queen himself.

Queen Elsa mourning the loss of her sister.
On the fjord, Elsa is confronted by Hans, though she pleads for the prince to take care of Anna in her absence. In response, Hans claims that Anna died of a frozen heart despite his efforts to save her and blames Elsa for her death. Horrified, Elsa breaks down in sorrow, which effectively ends the snowstorm. With Elsa distracted, Hans slowly approaches the Snow Queen from behind and draws his sword, ready to decapitate her. His plans are foiled by Anna, who sacrifices herself to save Elsa just as the frozen heart curse consumes her body and kills her while shattering Hans' sword blade on contact. Upon realizing Anna's fate, Elsa breaks down in tears as Arendelle's citizens examine that Elsa is not a monster after all. Fortunately, Anna's body begins to thaw shortly after that, much to Elsa's surprise and relief.

Olaf deduces that the "act of true love" was Anna's sacrifice to save Elsa, which helps the latter to realize that the curse can be lifted with the power of love. With this revelation, Elsa thaws Arendelle, bringing summer back to the kingdom. With peace restored, Elsa rekindles her bond with Anna and is praised by her people for freeing them from the curse. After returning to her rightful position as queen of Arendelle, Elsa cuts off trade with Weselton, deports Hans (whom she also orders imprisoned), the Duke, and his men for their attempted assassinations, and names Kristoff the "Official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer". Additionally, she is shown to have become a generous, loving ruler towards her people; allowing the castle gates to remain open, while also creating an ice skating rink during a celebration for the kingdom's enjoyment. All the while, Anna expresses her happiness over the newfound way of life, much to Elsa's satisfaction, and the two sisters finally embrace their restored relationship.

Frozen Fever
Elsa in Frozen Fever.
Frozen Fever centers the celebration surrounding Anna's 19th birthday. As a means to compensate for the years spent in forced isolation, resulting in lackluster and lonely birthdays, Elsa puts every ounce of her power into organizing a meaningful day to be spent between herself and Anna. After gathering several gifts based on Anna's personal interests, Elsa spreads them across the castle and kingdom and lastly puts her efforts into preparing the castle's courtyard, where the special cake is to be served. Assisting the Snow Queen are Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven, and although things seem to be going well, Elsa's perfectionist nature keeps her anxious. She is nevertheless assured by Kristoff that all will be well on his watch, and with that, Elsa departs to awaken Anna and officially start the day.

Following a trail of string throughout the castle and the village, Elsa and Anna begin their day of sisterly bonding while presenting the latter with her gifts, but throughout, Elsa constantly sneezes and sniffles as it becomes clear that a cold has consumed the queen. Whenever she sneezes, miniature snow-babies known as Snowgies are born, and they immediately rush to the castle courtyard and cause a mess as Kristoff, Olaf and Sven struggle to suppress them.

Meanwhile, Elsa's fever worsens to the point where she becomes delirious, thus affecting her actions. The hectic day leads to the city's clock tower, and a delirious Elsa nearly falls off the ledge, only to be saved by Anna. Finally, coming down from her high, a comforting Anna manages to have Elsa admit the presence of her fever, and the sisters return to the castle. Guilty over the trouble she's caused, Elsa apologizes to her sister for ruining another birthday, though the latter assures that nothing was ruined and that Elsa just needs to rest in bed.

Anna takes her sister back into the castle gates, only to find Kristoff, Sven, Olaf, and the Snowgies having managed to successfully keep the party intact. A celebration follows, and Elsa, still delirious, insists on blowing the celebratory horn, which shoots out a massive snowball as a result of a sneeze, and flies all the way to the Southern Isles where it smacks into the conniving Prince Hans, causing the prince to be knocked into a wagon of horse manure.

After a successful birthday celebration, Anna helps Elsa into bed and happily remarks that taking care of her beloved big sister is her best birthday present ever.

Olaf's Frozen Adventure
Elsa in Olaf's Frozen Adventure.
In Olaf's Frozen Adventure, Elsa and Anna prepare to celebrate their first Christmas together since the gates have reopened. They do so by planning a party for the kingdom to enjoy at the castle, but their subjects instead choose to celebrate their own family traditions at home. Anna asks Elsa if they have traditions of their own, but because of Elsa's isolation, they couldn't spend the holidays together as a family. Olaf looks to rectify the problem by going out and finding traditions for the sisters to share. Later that night, Elsa finds Anna rummaging through their old belongings in the attic. While doing so, Elsa finds a box filled with snowman memorabilia modeled after Olaf that Anna would send her every Christmas. The two declare Olaf to be their tradition and celebrate the revelation by throwing a Christmas party out in the mountains with Olaf as the guest of honor.

Ralph Breaks the Internet
Elsa in Ralph Breaks the Internet.
In Ralph Breaks the Internet, Elsa appears as a netizen resident of Oh My Disney. She and the other Disney princesses work as cast members that meet-and-greet net users. When Vanellope von Schweetz is confronted by First Order Stormtroopers, she glitches into the princesses' backstage room to evade them. Upon arriving, Elsa is seen conversing with Moana and Anna. The princesses mistake Vanellope for a threat and charge at her with various weapons; Elsa is about to use her ice powers. Vanellope explains that she's actually a princess as well, prompting Pocahontas to ask what kind of princess she is. Elsa questions if Vanellope has "magic hands" while demonstrating her magic, but Vanellope denies. When Jasmine asks if Vanellope has "daddy issues", she notes that she doesn't even have a mom, to which Elsa and Anna relate.

Shortly after declaring Vanellope a princess, Elsa and the others princesses admire Vanellope's casual modern clothes. While doing so, Elsa says that she thinks Vanellope's outfit is "so cool!" They then change into more comfy modern outfits to match, made by Cinderella's mice. Elsa wears an ice blue sweater with a graphic that reads "JUST LET IT GO" in bold white letters, black, sparkly sweatpants, and ice blue ballet flats. During the rest of Vanellope's visit, Elsa is seen lounging on a cushion on the floor while sipping a milkshake.

During the climax of the film, Elsa and the princesses spot Ralph about to plummet to his doom from the air. The princesses rally together to rescue the bad guy, using their individual abilities to do so. Moana summons the ocean, which Ariel dives into to swim upward and create a spiral. Jasmine and Elsa fly towards the top using Carpet, from which they are able to join with Ariel. Elsa then uses her powers to create an ice slide for Ralph. After he is saved, the princesses introduce themselves as friends of Vanellope, with Elsa adding that anyone who is Vanellope's friend is their friend as well.

Frozen II
Elsa looking out on the balcony listening for the voice.
Elsa returns in the sequel, this time as the protagonist. Three years have passed since Elsa revealed her powers, and the now 24-year-old queen has settled into her position as Arendelle's reigning monarch. And yet, Elsa is not content with her place, in spite of her companionship with Anna, Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven, and the acceptance from her subjects. With her powers growing exponentially with each passing day, Elsa is stuck with many questions about who and what she really is, and wonders if her purpose is really meant to be ruling Arendelle in her parents' stead after their untimely deaths. Meanwhile, a strange, siren-like voice that only Elsa can hear starts calling to her. Elsa wonders if it is somehow connected to her powers and origins. Despite this, Elsa fears that pursuing the voice may come at the cost of her family, and thus tries to ignore its call.

Elsa performing "Into the Unknown".
One night, Elsa's frustration with the voice's presence causes her to finally pursue its call. As she follows the voice out of the castle and to the edge of the fjord, Elsa lets her magic run free, unconsciously generating snowy projections of various scenes and objects, including a gust of wind, a flame, humanoid rocks, and a mystic horse. Too enticed to turn away, Elsa embraces the voice's call and awakens the spirits of the Enchanted Forest, who initiate an assault on Arendelle. This causes panic across the kingdom, the inhabitants of which are evacuated to the cliffs by Anna and Elsa. Once everyone is safe, Elsa admits her doings to Anna. Grand Pabbie soon arrives with the rock trolls and tells Elsa that the elements are acting out from anger of a past offense, and the only way to save Arendelle is to quell their rage and restore balance, or he foresees no future for the kingdom. Elsa declares that to save her kingdom, she must find the mysterious voice. Despite her desire to go alone, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven insist upon accompanying Elsa on her journey. Pabbie and his rock trolls promise to take care of the people of Arendelle until the Royal Sisters returned.

Elsa and Anna learn about what happened to their parents when they died.
In the forest, they discover that a delegation of Arendellian guards under the command of their father's former bodyguard, Lieutenant Mattias, and the people of the Northuldra have been trapped in the forest for over thirty years. Though initially wary of Elsa, the Northuldra come to trust her upon witnessing her connection to the spirits of wind and fire. Gale combines its magic with Elsa's to reveal that the sisters’ mother, Queen Iduna, was herself a member of the Northuldra. With this knowledge, the Northuldra members welcome Elsa and Anna into their family. While recouping at the Northuldra campsite, Elsa learns from a Northuldra woman named Honeymaren that there is a fabled “fifth spirit”, said to be the bridge between the magic of nature and people. Elsa wonders if the fifth spirit is the one that has been calling to her, but Honeymaren declares that, “Only Ahtohallan knows”. With Gale and Bruni as their guides, Elsa and Anna continue on their quest to find the voice. They are led to the Dark Sea, where they find the wreckage of the Arendellian ship on which their parents drowned. By uncovering lost relics and channeling the memory of the water, Elsa and Anna discover that their parents were voyaging to Ahtohallan to learn the source of Elsa's powers. Elsa chooses to traverse the Dark Sea to find Ahtohallan, which she believes holds the answers she has been seeking.

Elsa discovers she is the fifth spirit.
Anna again insists on coming, reminding Elsa about their mother's warnings that they could “drown” if they go too far. However, Elsa knows that sending Anna and Olaf with her would upset the balance between both worlds, so she uses her magic to conjure an iceboat, which sends away her sister and the accompanying Olaf as a means of protecting them, though it angers Anna and Olaf in the process. She then tames another of the spirits, the water spirit, known as the Nokk, and with Nokk's help, travels across the sea. Arriving at Ahtohallan, Elsa ventures into a deep cavern looking for the fifth spirit; the voice grows even louder, and as Elsa follows it, she finds herself in a room with all the elemental symbols engraved on the floor. Once she steps in the center, she sees a vision of her mother sing in unison with her. Elsa then realizes the symbols form a star, and its center represents the fifth spirit. Upon realizing that the fifth spirit is the connection between the elements, Elsa's dress transforms into a beautiful white gown with two waving cape strands as the symbols transform into ice diamonds that become one with the dress. Elsa realizes that she is the fifth spirit—the bridge between nature and people—and ascends to her true identity of the Snow Queen.

Elsa frozen to death in Ahtohallan.
After the spiritual revelation, Elsa uses her powers to create moving replicas of people in the past and memory. After scouring some of her memories, Elsa soon comes across the statues representing events within the Enchanted Forest—the ones concerning her grandfather King Runeard and the Northuldra. Exploring further, Elsa learns Runeard detested magic in the belief that magic corrupts and makes people defy authority like his status as King of Arendelle, which motivated his actions. Elsa soon uncovers her grandfather's dark secret: the dam supposedly built by the people of Arendelle as a gift for the Northuldra was actually a ploy by Runeard to drain their magic and ruin them, with him even going so far as striking down the Northuldra leader when he was unarmed and unaware of Runeard preparing to murder him to instigate war between the Northuldra and Arendelle. Having gone too deep into Ahtohallan's depths and ignored her mother's warnings from the lullaby she sang to her and Anna when they were younger, Elsa rapidly begins to freeze to death, though more slowly and painfully compared to Anna when under the frozen heart curse, but manages to use her final moments to send a message to Anna, revealing this truth, before she freezes solid completely, entombing her in Ahtohallan as her grave.

Elsa embracing her newfound freedom.
Anna is bereft, and more so when Olaf disappears due to the loss of Elsa's magic, nevertheless, she moves forward. Anna calls the Earth Giants to aid her to destroy the dam. Lieutenant Mattias tries to stop Anna, but she reveals to him that King Runeard betrayed the Northuldra and was the true culprit behind the war. Anna also tells him that Elsa possibly lost her life to reveal the truth to him and his fellow soldiers. This convinces them to help Anna to avenge losing another monarch under their protection, drawing the Earth Giants towards the dam by banging their swords against their shields to get their attention. They manage to destroy the dam, setting off a flood that threatens to destroy Arendelle. Destroying the dam releases the curse upon the forest and thaws Elsa, who is still weakened from freezing solid, causing her to fall into the Dark Sea before being rescued by the Nokk when it sees her in trouble. Elsa rides the Nokk to the waters of Arendelle and freezes the approaching wave, protecting the kingdom. These events are all witnessed by the citizens of Arendelle, Grand Pabbie, and his rock trolls, who cheer for Elsa for her heroic act, while Pabbie gives her a respective nod of congrats himself. She then returns to the forest, where she reunites with Anna, Kristoff, and Sven, who are relieved to see she's alive. Elsa commends Anna for her heroism, and reveals that she and Anna are the Fifth Spirit and the two sides of the bridge. After asking Anna, "Do You Want to Build a Snowman?", Elsa uses her magic to restore Olaf, as water has memory. The group embraces and Elsa promises Olaf not to put their lives at risk again. After talking with Yelana and Honeymaren, Elsa declares that she will remain in the Enchanted Forest as its protector, while Anna is dubbed the new Queen of Arendelle. Following her decision, Elsa lives among the Northuldra and her fellow spirits, but makes regular return visits to Arendelle to spend time with her family.

Once Upon a Snowman
Elsa only makes a brief appearance in this midquel short film taking place during the events of Frozen. She only appears during the musical number "Let It Go", where it is shown that Elsa brought Olaf to life during the events of the musical number. The events of "Let It Go" resume as Olaf finds himself exploring the world around him.

Other appearances
Elsa and Anna make a small cameo appearance in the animated mini-series It's a Small World: The Animated Series, in the episode "Little Birds, Frost and Pine", happily playing in the winter snow together, building Olaf.

An emoticon version of Elsa appeared in the Frozen, Frozen Fever, and Olaf's Frozen Adventure entries of the As Told by Emoji short series.

An otter version of Elsa appeared on the cover of Duke Weaselton's bootleg copy of Floatzen 2 in the film Zootopia.

In LEGO Frozen Northern Lights, Elsa and Anna embark on a journey to uncover the mystery behind the northern lights' disappearance. As an exaggerated version of herself, Elsa is portrayed as an overdramatic pessimist, though this stress also cripples her abilities, which adds difficulty to the adventure. A running gag involves Elsa preparing to sing "Let It Go", only to be interrupted before she can.

Live-action appearances
Once Upon a Time


Elsa appears in the season finale of the show's third season and she is portrayed by Australian actress Georgina Haig. The flashbacks of Arendelle are set about two years after events that are equivalent to the events of Frozen, and approximately a year before the first Dark Curse was cast in the general Once timeline.
In the midst of preparations surrounding Anna and Kristoff's wedding, Elsa discovers that her parents set off on a mysterious mission in regard to her abilities. Elsa and Anna learn from Grand Pabbie that they were traveling to a land known as Misthaven; better known as the Enchanted Forest. Determined to learn why Anna travels to Misthaven, without Elsa's consent, and much to the latter's dismay. Meanwhile, Elsa and Kristoff defend the kingdom from an invading Hans, who concocted a scheme to trap the Ice Queen within an enchanted urn. Kristoff and Elsa get to the urn first but are cornered by Hans and three of his brothers. Elsa and Kristoff are able to defend themselves until Hans puts a sword to Kristoff's back, and threatens his life. Hans tells Elsa he will spare Kristoff if Elsa gives him the urn, which she does. When Hans opened the urn to capture the queen, however, a mysterious being is released, instead, and freezes Hans as punishment for his cruel ways. The being is soon revealed to be Elsa's maternal aunt, Ingrid. Like Elsa, Ingrid holds power over ice and snow and is universally known as the Snow Queen. Elsa welcomes Ingrid back into Arendelle and is soon greeted by Anna returned from her adventures. However, it is soon discovered that Ingrid has villainous intentions. Years before Anna and Elsa, Ingrid was the elder sister of Gerda (Anna and Elsa's mother) and Helga. One day, Ingrid accidentally killed Helga, resulting in Gerda, in grief, trapping Ingrid in the magical urn to prevent her from causing more harm. From there, Gerda asked Grand Pabbie to erase Helga and Ingrid from the records and minds of Arendelle. When Ingrid returned, she wanted a new family to fill the void her sisters left, but one where they are equally empowered with magic, thus decidedly plotting to eliminate Anna. In hopes of turning Elsa against her sister, as well, Ingrid entrances Anna, forcing the latter to confront a confused and frightful Elsa. Anna threatens to imprison Elsa within the same urn that trapped Ingrid, and although Ingrid intended for Elsa to kill her sister before she had the chance. Elsa refused to hurt Anna and Anna unseals the urn in which Elsa is then imprisoned. Ingrid in a rage takes the urn from Anna and freezes over all of Arendelle, Ingrid then erases Elsa's memories of ever meeting her so the two could have a fresh start after Ingrid released Elsa from the urn. However, before Ingrid could release Elsa, Rumplestiltskin appears and takes the urn from Ingrid and tells Ingrid he will give it back if she gives him the magical hat. Ingrid does not oblige to the Dark One's request and Elsa is stored in Rumple's vault.


Elsa is released from the urn.
Years later, Emma Swan and Captain Hook are transported back in time and after correcting their mistakes they are imprisoned in the vault of the Dark One by Rumple who believes the two of them can not return to the future. Hook attempts to search the vault for a way out and finds the urn that contains Elsa, Emma tells him to put it down which he does. Moments later Emma is able to recover her magic and open a time portal to the future in which Elsa's urn is accidentally sucked into. After Hook and Emma have returned to Storybrooke they leave the area, after they have departed Elsa breaks free from her urn, shatters it with her magic, and proceeds to walk out of the barn hastily creating a trail of frost in her wake.

Though initially frightened by her surroundings, causing great chaos as a result, such as creating a giant snowman that turns wild until it is destroyed by Regina. Elsa manages to retreat the chaos and stumbles upon Anna's necklace in Mr. Gold's (Rumplestiltskin) shop. Elsa after finding Anna's necklace creates an ice wall the surrounds the entire town. Emma meets Elsa who was hiding behind the wall, and Emma nearly dies due to a cave in but Elsa saves her. Later that night Emma and Elsa go to the ice wall so Elsa can take it down but for some reason, her magic is unable to melt it.

Ingrid traps Elsa.
As time passes, Elsa and Emma form a strong friendship, and the other members of the town no longer see Elsa as a threat. Emma and the others decide to join their new companion in the search for her sister. The group would eventually encounter Ingrid, who uses her magic to keep the ice wall up, though Elsa fails to remember her as her memory was wiped by the Snow Queen to prevent confrontations. Elsa and Captain Hook confront Ingrid after the latter has frozen Maid Marian, but Ingrid tells Elsa everyone fears people with magic and tries to kill Hook to prove to Elsa that the town will turn on her. Emma is able to stop Ingrid, but she gets away. Later Ingrid creates a false Anna to lure Elsa away from Emma, and she traps her niece. Ingrid needs Elsa out of her way so she can obtain Regina's mirror. Elsa is able to break free from her bonds and stops Ingrid, who was using her magic to choke Emma and Regina. Elsa tells Ingrid to fight her, but Ingrid again flees.

Like before, Ingrid plots to recreate her family and selects Elsa and Emma (who also has magical powers) as her victims. Convinced that she could only gain their love when she was the only one left, Ingrid obtained a mirror capable of bringing out the worst in people. The mirror was missing one piece, a shard from Regina's mirror, which Ingrid had just stolen. If a piece of the mirror were to get in someone's eye, they would see nothing but hatred in the world. Ingrid had planned to use this on everyone in Storybrooke (dubbed the Spell of Shattered Sight), forcing all of its citizens to turn against one another and battle to the death while she, Emma, and Elsa remained immune.

Anna and Elsa sadly watch as their aunt sacrifices herself to undo her curse.
Back in Arendelle, Anna tried to track down a device known as a wishing star, which will have the power to bring her and Kristoff to wherever Elsa is. It was apparently the necklace Elsa had given her long ago, Elsa using it to bring Anna and Kristoff to Storybrooke. However, the Spell of Shattered Sight had already begun, and the only ones immune to it were Elsa, Emma, and Anna. Tracking down a note written by Elsa and Anna's mother right before her death, Anna brings it to Ingrid. It reads that Gerda requests that Ingrid is freed from the urn and states she truly loved her sister and regretted trapping her away. Realizing she always had her sisters' love, Ingrid destroys herself to ensure the curse is lifted.

With the help of Rumplestiltskin, Elsa, Anna, and Kristoff are able to discover a door that will lead back to Arendelle, though they will not be able to return, as the door will disappear after its use. Anna and Kristoff depart, while Elsa and Emma share a tearful goodbye before returning to Arendelle with her sister. Back in their home kingdom, Anna's wedding is underway, and the two sisters share a brief chat before heading to the chapel, hand-in-hand.

Sometime after, Arendelle would be under siege again; this time by the pirate Blackbeard. Having learned and mastered some new magic, Elsa managed to defeat him. As punishment for how he mistreated her sister and her brother-in-law, including his collaboration with Hans, Elsa shrinks the pirate and his crew, and turn their ship, the Jolly Roger, into a ship in a bottle, unaware that she also trapped the mermaid Ariel as well.

In the episode "Beauty", a young girl is seen dressed as Elsa for Halloween.

Printed media
Anna & Elsa: Sisterhood is the Strongest Magic
In this continuation of the film, Elsa is featured as the warm ruler of Arendelle, struggling to rekindle with her sister and care for her kingdom, which regularly requests her attention. This aspect is largely the focus of All Hail the Queen.

In Memory and Magic, Elsa encounters a young troll who claims to have the power to restore the memories of Anna that Pabbie erased years ago. However, a reluctant Elsa goes against the idea and chooses to create new memories instead.

Elsa plays a more heroic role in A Warm Welcome, where Olaf informs her of a summer queen with power over fire and heat. But when the snowman also mentions her land is trapped in eternal summer, the Snow Queen and Anna take action and launch a rescue mission.

In The Secret Admirer, Elsa receives a message from an anonymous lover, prompting Anna and Olaf to uncover the sender in hopes of pairing Elsa up. The book hints that Elsa may be romantic, showing that while she's flattered that someone has feelings for her and is curious who they are, she's not as curious as Anna or Olaf, who essentially look through every possible candidate. This suggests she is not necessarily against the idea of being in a relationship, but she puts her kingdom and her sister above all else. Although more social and in complete control of her powers, Elsa still has slight haphephobia (fear of being touched), having slight trouble with a kiss on her hand.

In Return to the Ice Palace, Elsa's relationship with the Snowgies is briefly explored; she treats them very much in the vein of her own toddlers, as she warmly allows them to play along with her dress during her visit to their home, in the ice palace.

Kingdom Keepers
Elsa is mentioned in the seventh book Kingdom Keepers VII: The Insider, where she was asked to slow the storm approaching the park that the Overtakers were going to use to ignite natural gas flooding it.

Conceal, Don't Feel (A Twisted Tale)
In the Twisted Tale novel Conceal, Don't Feel, Elsa grew up with no memory of Anna because she attempted to interfere in the spell to erase Anna's memories of her magic, which resulted in both sisters losing all recollection of each other and Anna being 'cursed' so that she would turn to ice if she spent too long in proximity to Elsa. However, she also lost all memory of her abilities, living a relatively normal life until the trauma of her parents' deaths caused her to lose her emotional control and trigger her powers. During the next few years, she creates Olaf, who acts as a secret confident for her, and the Duke of Weselton attempts to arrange a relationship between her and Hans by introducing her to Hans under the guise of them being a similar age in a similar position. However, Elsa genuinely never sees Hans as more than a friend, and shortly before her coronation she regains her memories of Anna after finding a box that was meant to be used to hold Anna's items as she was growing up. After Hans tries to propose to Elsa, she triggers her powers and ran away as in canon, eventually finding the trolls to confirm what actually happened the night when she struck Anna. Eventually, Anna (who had also found evidence of her relationship to Elsa) manages to find Elsa and fully break the spell suppressing their memories, the novel ends with them both reveling in their new relationship.

Other books
The story, A Sister More Like Me, gives an expanded look at her character. She's revealed to be intelligent, a lover of academics, and has a fondness for tea.

A Year with Elsa & Anna (and Olaf, too!) describes Elsa's birth as having occurred at night and during which the aurora borealis phenomenon occurred.

Forest of Shadows takes place a few months before the second movie. Elsa needs to go overseas for a few months and leaves Anna to look after Arendelle in her absence. Elsa's departure is halted by an unexpected plague, followed by a Nattmara. In the end, the Nattura is defeated. This story also foreshadows the events of the second movie, such as a Vision of the earth giants destroying a dam. It also depicts Anna desiring to do more for the people of Arendelle and highlights her insecurities of being the "spare". In addition to showing Elsa's stress being queen due to her introverted personality. This emphasizes how fulfilled Anna and Elsa become in the sequel, with Anna being crowned Queen and Elsa being free of expectation to be who she is.

Tales of Courage and Kindness takes place after the sequel, this story shows us Elsa's life in the Enchanted Forest and her new role keeping peace between humans and nature as the fifth spirit. She becomes aware that something is wrong in the forest, something that the other spirits sense as well. The source of the disturbance is discovered when they find a couple collecting a large quantity of acorns so they could grow their own forest. The spirits reach aggressively to this but Elsa uses her powers to calm them down to protect the couple before explaining to them how their actions are hurting the forest. The couple returns the acorns and peace is restored.

Video games
Disney Infinity
Elsa is included as a playable character in Disney Infinity and its subsequent 2.0 and 3.0 editions, playable in the Toy Box Mode of all games. She was released both as a singular figure and with her sister Anna in a dual Frozen Toy Box pack with two customization Power Discs.

Elsa also has her own exclusive adventure called "Elsa's Slingshot Gallery". The aim is to hit targets with your slingshot to get as many points as you can within a certain time limit. Yellow targets yield 1 point, while red targets yield 3 points.

Disney Magical World 2
Elsa first appears shortly after the player arrives in Arendelle alongside Olaf. At the time, Arendelle was being plagued by a legion of mischievous ghosts. With Elsa's magic having no effect on the ghosts, she and Anna visit Grand Pabbie for advice. While in the Valley of the Living Rock, the sisters meet the player and are told of their magic powers. Elsa then enlists the player in cleansing Arendelle. Afterward, she is found in the castle and regularly gives the player tasks throughout the game.

Kingdom Hearts series
In Kingdom Hearts Union χ, Elsa appears as a combat Prime power medal used by the game's avatars along with her sister Anna. Her power from the medals was channeled by the Book of Prophecies.

In Kingdom Hearts III, Elsa appears in her homeworld, "Arendelle" playing a similar role to the original movie but with her brief interactions with Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy. Behind the scenes, Elsa becomes the unknowing target of Organization XIII, due to her potentially pure heart.

Sora first spots Elsa fleeing across the fjord as it freezes in her wake. When they catch up to her and introduce themselves, an argument between Sora and Donald pushes Elsa to the point where she uses her powers to silence them, shocking and scaring the trio. Heartless then warp in to attack them, but Sora, Donald, and Goofy fight them off. After apologizing to the trio and thanking them, Elsa uses her powers to take out a reindeer-like Heartless that tried to pounce on Sora from behind while he was speaking with her. Sora is amazed about her powers, but Elsa admits that she fears her powers only hurt people, and has chosen to run away to the North Mountain, believing Arendelle is safer without her, before blocking Sora from pursuing with an ice wall and asking him to go away. After that, the game recreates "Let It Go" as Elsa creates her ice palace and dress. When Sora, Donald, and Goofy discover it, they are in awe, before Larxene appears. Larxene confirms she was dispatched to ensure Elsa becomes one of the new Seven Hearts to succeed the previous Princesses of Heart, and sends the trio flying with a powerful ice storm to keep them from interfering with Elsa's path towards light or darkness.

After learning more about Elsa from her sister, Anna, Sora compares Elsa distancing herself to help Anna with Riku sacrificing his freedom to close Kingdom Hearts. As in the film, Elsa's bittersweet reunion with Anna culminates in Elsa accidentally hitting Anna in her heart with her powers. At that moment, Sora, having arrived at the palace entrance, senses Anna' heart hit and frozen by Elsa's magic.

Once they evade Marshmallow, Sora, Donald, and Goofy find Elsa being carried back to Arendelle by Prince Hans, but they notice darkness emanating from him and realize Elsa is in danger, so they give pursuit of him. After coercing Marshmallow to help them save Elsa, the trio track down a grieving Elsa about to be struck down by Hans on the frozen fjord, only for Anna to jump in to take the blow herself just as the curse completely overtakes her and turns her into solid ice. After Sora fends off Sköll, a wolf-like Heartless manifested from Hans' darkness after he was knocked unconscious, Sora returns to see Elsa weeping over Anna's frozen body. However, Anna's sacrifice to save Elsa's constituted an "act of true love", breaking the curse and restoring Anna to flesh and blood.

Before Sora, Donald and Goofy can reunite with the royal sisters, they are intercepted by Larxene, who is surprised that Anna's love for Elsa filled both of their hearts with light. She then drops the bombshell on Sora that the Organization has already gathered their thirteen pieces of darkness and departs with a warning that if Sora fails to gather his seven Guardians of Light, the Organization may go after Elsa and Anna instead. Though Sora is concerned by Larxene's fateful warning, Donald and Goofy encourage him to not give up, especially for Anna and Elsa, as they are strong together because of their love for each other. Soon after, Elsa is able to gain control over her powers and ends Arendelle's winter. With Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf at her side, Elsa celebrates the return of summer with Sora, Donald, and Goofy, before they set off on their next adventure.

In the game's credits, Elsa is seen generating an ice ramp for Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf to safely land on after they fly off their sled. Anna joins Elsa afterward as Marshmallow arrives, with Olaf having fallen to pieces again, but Olaf soon puts himself back together as Marshmallow smiles, while Anna and Elsa look on in amusement.

Musical
Caissie Levy as Elsa in the Frozen musical.
In the film's stage adaptation, Elsa's role was originated by actress Caissie Levy and is slightly more developed than the animated counterpart. The musical puts more emphasis on the internal and external struggles that come with Elsa's powers. The show is also more blatant and direct with the darker themes that make up Elsa's arc, some of which were only hinted at in the animated film.

While visiting the hidden folk during the first act of the show, Elsa begs Pabbie to remove her powers, though he explains that he cannot as her powers are part of her. This leads Elsa to agree with her father that she and Anna be separated, even going as far as to counsel her hesitant mother about the decision. Despite Agnarr and Iduna's deaths early on, Elsa would occasionally look to them for guidance throughout the show.

Elsa takes part in several numbers, though two new solos were written specifically for the Snow Queen as spiritual companion pieces (and antithesis) for "Let It Go" - the first being "Dangerous to Dream", in which Elsa mourns the loss of her freedom and happiness at the expense of her powers. During "Monster", Elsa laments the tragedy that her powers have brought upon the world, and desperately looks for a way to end her troubles as Hans and his men seize the Ice Palace.

Disney Princess

Anna and Elsa were originally slated to join the Disney Princess franchise as the twelfth and thirteenth Princesses, respectfully. The two were even given two-dimensional art, similar to those of Rapunzel and Merida. However, with the financial and critical success of their movie, the two are currently the stars of the Frozen franchise, rendering it unnecessary to include the two in another major franchise because of how well their movie did at the box office.

Despite this, the two have been commonly featured alongside members of the franchise in merchandise and media. They were referenced in the show Sofia the First. In "The Secret Library", a cold wind and ice droplets are shown in the secret tunnel, alongside other references to all the other Disney Princesses. Later, in "The Secret Library: Olaf and the Tale of Miss Nettle", Olaf is summoned by the Amulet of Avalor, due to the powers of Miss Nettle. It is implied by Olaf, however, that without Miss Nettle's intervention, Anna would have been summoned, as aside only Disney Princesses have been summoned by the amulet.

The two were also included in the updated version of "The Glow", a Disney Princess song.

Inside Shanghai Disneyland's Enchanted Storybook Castle, wall carvings of the official Disney Princesses are prominently displayed; Elsa and Anna are featured among them.

Despite not being official members, Elsa and Anna were added into the Ultimate Princess Celebration, due to the event being a unification of both the Disney Princess and Frozen franchises. In the celebration, they're presented as Frozen Queens.

According to Jennifer Lee, the Essential Guide, and the junior novelization, Elsa is 21 years old by the time of her coronation, and the age difference between her and Anna is approximately 3.5 years (Anna is 18 years old during the coronation).
According to Jennifer Lee and Disney, Elsa was born on the Winter Solstice. Given that the film takes place in July, Elsa would have turned 22 by winter. The map briefly shown in Frozen Fever suggests that the short took place in 1840, ergo Frozen took place during July 1839 (hence Oaken's statement, "A real howler in July, yes?") Since Elsa was 21 years old during Frozen, then her birth year must have been 1817. And since she was born on the Winter Solstice, then she was born on the 22nd of December 1817, since that is when the winter solstice occurred on that year in Norway. Her birthday is not celebrated on the Winter Solstice every year, necessarily, as that date differs. But she was born on the day that the Winter Solstice happened for that specific year. This birthday post by Disney was shared on the 22nd of December 2015.
Also, Frozen Fever confirms Anna's birthday to be a year after the film, and the potential year it takes place (1840), indicating that Elsa should have turned 23 that December, and been 22 during the events of Frozen Fever.
