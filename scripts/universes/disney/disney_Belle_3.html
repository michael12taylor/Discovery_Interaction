<html><p>Her role is greatly expanded in the sequel Kingdom Hearts II. Xaldin of Organization XIII had continued to play on the Beast's anger to plunge his heart into the darkness to create a powerful Heartless and Nobody to use for the Organization's plans, resulting in him sealing his servants in the dungeon while Belle holed up in her room in the East Wing. When Sora, Donald, and Goofy arrive and reunite with her, they are able to calm the Beast with support from Cogsworth. Belle tries to confront Xaldin on her own, but is met with a Heartless attack in the form of the Pureblood Shadow Stalker/Dark Thorn Heartless, which chases her into the ballroom before she escapes to safety on the outside balcony, leaving the Heartless to face Sora and the Beast, corrupting the ballroom with darkness to give it an advantage against them by turning the ballroom's own elements, such as the columns and chandelier, into weapons it could use against the Keyblade wielder and the Beast. After the creature was defeated, and Xaldin taunts the heroes briefly before retreating, the Beast apologizes to Belle, who accepts it, but scolds him for not trusting her. She later goes on a date with the Beast and prepares to dance with him in the ballroom until Xaldin interrupts the dance, much to Belle's annoyance at having her date ruined by Xaldin as he summons his personal Dragoon Nobodies to fight Sora and the Beast while Belle takes cover on the outside balcony with the servants. After Xaldin leaves, the Beast realizes that his enchanted rose is in danger, and arrives in the West Wing to find Xaldin had stolen it. He finds himself in despair after this discovery, and asks Belle to leave out of shame for his actions when he takes his frustration out on her before Sora intervenes and reprimands him for blaming her for what happened. Returning to her room in the East Wing and changing from her ballgown back to her regular clothes, Belle finds the rose on her balcony later on, but it's revealed to be a trap by Xaldin, who kidnaps her and forces the Beast to choose between her and the rose to leave behind. Beast chooses Belle, but Belle suddenly fights back against the Organization member and takes back the rose, forcing Xaldin to have to fight Sora, Donald, Goofy, and the Beast instead after losing both of his bargaining chips thanks to Belle. After Xaldin is defeated, Belle returns the rose to the Beast, who then asks her to stay with him in his castle, to which she happily accepts. The credits reveal that the Beast has transformed back into a human, apparently ending the Beauty and the Beast story arc in the series.

Disney Princess: Enchanted Journey
Unlike the other Princesses are featured in the game, Belle and her world play a minor role and acts as a mere mini-game. Belle and Lumiere are featured in the world and ask the player to eliminate the game's enemies (Bogs) before Beast finds out about their presence.

Disney Heroes: Battle Mode
Belle appears in the mobile fighting video game as a new and unlockable character with ten tokens, despite not having a basic attack, her ability to read gives her energy, in addition to doing a little jump to provide a shield does not It was present in the film but the stick that she used to protect herself from wolves is present as well as Maurice's invention.

Kinect Disneyland Adventures
Belle appears as a meet-and-greet character in Fantasyland. She also takes part in the Mickey's Soundsational Parade and Princess Fantasy Faire mini-games. She is normally found outside the Princess Fantasy Faire, across from where Ariel stands, and her first request upon speaking with her involves recovering several of the Beast's books that blew away in a thunderstorm. After they are found and returned to her, she then asks the player to see if they can find more, as ten more books are scattered around the park in the various lands that can be returned to her when they are all recovered. Her final request is to replace some of the Beast's pictures that he wrecked when he lost his temper one day. Completing her tasks unlocks her at the Princess Fantasy Faire as one of the Princesses the player can dance with.

Musical
Susan Egan as Belle in the stage adaptation.
A Broadway musical adaptation of the film premiered on Broadway on April 18, 1994, at the Palace Theatre with Susan Egan as the original Belle. Since then, many actresses including Deborah Gibson, Toni Braxton, Andrea McArdle, Jamie-Lynn Sigler, Christy Carlson Romano, and Ashley Brown have played the role on Broadway. The show closed on July 29, 2007, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater with Anneliese van der Pol as the show's final Belle.

Overall, Belle's role was the same as in the film, although some differences included Belle politely refusing Gaston's hand in marriage instead of tricking him into falling into a mud pool, joining Lumiere and dancing along with the dishes and silverware during the Be Our Guest musical number instead of just sitting at the dining table and merely observing the spectacle, and her being injured by the Beast when she entered the West Wing before fleeing instead of merely being scared off. Additionally, her role is expanded in the musical with songs "No Matter What" (cut in touring productions), "Home" and "A Change in Me".

Belle is also without Philippe in the stage version, instead of knitting a "lucky" scarf for Maurice to wear during his trip to the fair. Maurice is attacked by wolves before becoming a prisoner within the Beast's castle. His scarf is lost in the woods, and eventually found by LeFou. When LeFou is spotted in town with the scarf, he reveals to Belle the whereabouts in which he found it, prompting her to search for her potentially endangered father.

When given the library, Belle also reveals "King Arthur" to be amongst her favorite stories.

Disney Parks
Belle in Disneyland.
Disneyland Resort
At Disneyland, Belle can be spotted on a float in Mickey's Soundsational Parade. At the Fantasy Faire, Belle tells her tale with help from Lumiere, Mister Smythe, and Mister Jones in the Royal Theater.

Belle appears in the original version of World of Color in Disney California Adventure. She appears in the opening during the theme of the show shown ball dancing with Beast. She later appears starting the show's finale as she confesses her love for Beast, and he transforms into a handsome prince.

Belle is also prominently featured in Paint the Night parade, as part of a Princess-themed float, alongside Cinderella and Rapunzel.

Belle also frequently appears for meet-and-greets, both in her blue and gold dresses. More recently, though, the blue dress has been the only one seen due to the gold dress causing back issues to cast members.

Walt Disney World
In the former show held at the Magic Kingdom, Storytime with Belle, Belle would tell her story to an audience, some of which were chosen to act as characters in the story. The show then became part of the attraction, Enchanted Tales with Belle. In the same park, she can be seen making daily appearances in the first float of the Festival of Fantasy Parade.

Belle has her own spell card in the attraction Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom known as "Belle's Mountain Blizzard".

In Beauty and the Beast Live on Stage at Disney's Hollywood Studios, Belle appears and plays out her same role as in the film. In the same park, Belle can also be found in Fantasmic!, during the princess-themed medley. It also appeared at Disneyland Park (Paris) until 1997.

For meet-and-greets, she has made appearances with Gaston in the Magic Kingdom's New Fantasyland and alone at Epcot's World Showcase around the France pavilion. Most of the time, she's seen in her blue peasant dress. However, during Epcot's Festival of the Holidays, she'll wear her red and gold dress from The Enchanted Christmas.

Tokyo Disney Resort
Belle is featured towards the end of Once Upon a Time, where she and Beast share a dance before the latter is attacked by Gaston. After Gaston's death, Belle is present to witness the Beast's transformation into a human. Belle and Beast also appear as the centerpiece for the Beauty and the Beast unit of Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade: DreamLights.

Disneyland Paris
In Paris, she, who presented by Rosie and Louis, holds a mask while entering The Starlit Princess Waltz as part of the 25th Anniversary, and its 2019 Christmas season, The Royal Sparkling Winter Waltz. Princesses hold fans and switch them and dance with Beast/Adam and princes.

At the Walt Disney Studios Park, Belle appears in Mickey and the Magician, sharing a ballroom waltz with Beast during Lumiere's segment of the show.

Hong Kong Disneyland
Belle is featured in the Flights of Fantasy Parade, along with the other Princesses on the Swan airboat, called Romance Takes Wing. She has also featured in the Paint the Night Parade as part of a Beauty and the Beast-themed float.

Shanghai Disneyland
Belle is featured on the Beauty and the Beast display in Voyage to the Crystal Grotto. A statue depicting Belle and Beast can also be found in the Shanghai Disneyland Hotel.

Disney Cruise Line
In Believe aboard the Disney Dream, Belle appears alongside Mrs. Potts in Lumiere's segment of the show.

Disney Princess
Belle's popularity and strong characterization led her to become a member of the Disney Princess franchise.

Redesign
Belle received many changes in her late 2012 redesign.

Her gown now possesses the same gold color from the film instead of the yellow color in the previous franchise, however, the bottom half is now decorated with glittery designs of roses.

The off-the-shoulder part of the dress is made of cream-colored organza and pinned in the front by three pearls of varying sizes. Her evening gloves match the color and material of the dress's shoulders.

In early redesigns, Belle's sleeves were covering her shoulders instead of revealing them.

Palace Pets
Belle's Palace Pets are Teacup, Petit, Rouge, Booksy, Page, and Lacy.

Differences from the source material
"Beauty" or "Little Beauty" was just a nickname, not her actual name. Her actual name was never mentioned.
Beauty's characterization in the original tale is depicted as kind, pure-hearted, but slightly timid. Belle on the other hand, while kind and pure-hearted like in the original tale, is also quirky, intelligent, open-minded and rebellious.
Beauty had (besides three brothers) two older sisters in the original story. According to screenwriter Linda Woolverton, she had removed Belle's sisters to keep the focus on Belle's strained relationship with Gaston, as well as to avoid confusion with Drizella and Anastasia Tremaine from Cinderella.
She at one point lived in a mansion, her father being a wealthy merchant before he lost all his fortune at sea. Then the family had to move and live in a small farmhouse. Early development in the film had originally intended to use this backstory, but it ended up cut.
In the original tale, Belle didn't mind that she lived a boring life as a peasant after moving to the country (while her sisters constantly complained about it), while in the Disney film, it's the exact opposite, as she expressed boredom towards the provincial life in the opening song.
The Beast received Beauty graciously and informed her that she was a mistress of the castle and that he was her servant. They would hold lengthy conversations, and he would give her lavish clothing and every night ask her to marry him, but she would always decline.
In the original story, her father sold her off to the Beast, due to her sisters refusing the Beast, as well as Belle ultimately accepting it due to blaming herself since it was her simple request for a rose that put her in that situation in the first place. In the movie, Belle volunteered to be taken prisoner for Maurice's freedom, with Maurice being unwilling to let Belle make that sacrifice.
While looking upon a mirror soon after her arrival, Beauty sees a vision of her father returning home.
While in the castle, Beauty would dream of a handsome prince asking her to marry him. Belle became convinced that the Beast was holding the prince captive somewhere in the castle. She looked but never found him.
Beauty asks to see her family again and promises to return in 8 days' time instead of being permanently released from imprisonment by the Beast with no fixed deadline to return back to the Beast's castle.
Beauty returns to the castle because she finds out that the Beast is dying from a broken heart in her much longer absence which was achieved by the Beast's instructions to place her ring on a table when she wanted to return.
At the end of the story, she and the Beast get married and the sisters are punished by a fairy in Beauty's dreams to become statues for the malice in their hearts but are to return to their present shape after they recognize their faults. Something similar occurs in the 1988 draft, although her sisters are instead turned into animals, alongside Belle's suitors.

Trivia
Belle's name means "beautiful" in French (not "beauty" which is said "beauté" in French). Her complete surname in the tale is "La belle enfant" ("The Beautiful Child").
Belle's movements maintain an air of elegance. This was at the request of the story writers and producers of Beauty and the Beast, where they studied the movements of ballerinas during the course of Belle's development. Like ballerinas, Belle walks diligently and swiftly on her toes no matter what types of shoes she is wearing or where she is located. She can subconsciously navigate her way through a crowded street while reading, without colliding with any other people or objects (although having several near-misses), at one point even deflecting water that was about to pour on top of her while she was reading without once looking up.
Belle's eyes were originally going to be gray, but in the final cut, they were hazel. Belle is currently the only official Disney Princess to have hazel eyes.
In the New Fantasyland, Belle's cottage shows a picture of her reading with her mother―a beautiful woman with wavy, light brown hair, blue eyes, and wearing a pink dress. One wall in the cottage also has height marks up until her 18th birthday, suggesting she maybe 18 years old during the films. Based on this painting, her mother, when she was still alive, probably looked exactly like Belle but with lighter hair and blue eyes.
The New Fantasyland attraction also implied with the height wall that Belle may have been born in the village, which contradicted a theory stemmed from a brief lyric in the opening song, that implied that Belle and her father had moved to the village sometime prior to the events of the original film.
The book Belle viewed as her favorite was also shown in the attraction to be "le Songe d'une femme" (lit. "the dream of a woman"), as a possible nod to Sleeping Beauty. It also revealed that, at least by the events of the movie, she had at least two copies of Sleeping Beauty: The one her mom read to her when she was a child (thus explaining why it was her favorite, as well as why she loved reading), and the other being the book she got from the bookstore during the opening song.
In addition, James Baxter, Belle's supervising animator, mentioned that Belle was "a few years older than Ariel," implying that Belle was at least 18 years old as Ariel is stated to be 16 in her own movie.

Before Paige O'Hara got the role of Belle, the producers first considered Jodi Benson, who was best known as the voice of Ariel, to voice Belle. Benson, however, did voice Belle in Disney's House of Mouse.
Belle is the only Disney Princess with a singing voice to not sing her film's main theme song during the film itself (Mrs. Potts, a supporting character, sings the song instead). Although, Paige O'Hara individually recorded her own version of Beauty and the Beast and performed it several times live, outside the film itself.
In Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Magical World, Belle tells the Beast the Cinderella fairy tale during the first segment.
In the beginning of the original 1989 storyline, found on the Diamond Edition DVD, Belle's birthday is celebrated, and the cake reads "Happy 17th Birthday Belle", providing evidence that she is 17 in the movie, or at least that she was originally planned to be 17.
Belle was nominated for AFI's 100 Year...100 Hero and Villain list, one of the three animated heroes and one of three Disney animated heroes, along with Peter Pan, Mary Poppins, and Buzz Lightyear. Unfortunately, none of them made the cut.
A costume of Belle, as well as the rest of the Disney Princesses (excluding Mulan, Pocahontas, Merida, and Moana), has been released on the video game Little Big Planet 2 as downloadable content from the PlayStation Store.
In the comic adaptation of the film, Belle wears her pinny more often and her ponytail like Gaston's stays intact even though it's raining.
One poster for the film for some reason showed Belle in a pink-and-purple dress resembling Rapunzel's.
In the Gargoyles episode "Eye of the Beholder", Elisa Maza dresses up as Belle for Halloween and shares a relationship with Goliath, similar to Belle's relationship with the Beast. However, Goliath is a beast turned into a human, unlike the Beast, whose circumstance is the polar opposite.
In the climax of The Haunted Mansion, Elizabeth Henshaw's ghost appears in a golden dress with opera gloves similar to that of Belle's iconic ensemble. Her love interest Master Gracey is dressed in a blue jacket with gold trim similar to that of the Beast's outfit.
Paige O'Hara, the first voice actor for Belle, does a fan artwork of Belle on her official website and sells the artwork.
The books Belle has read are Jack and the Beanstalk, Sleeping Beauty, and Romeo and Juliet (the last of which is only in "Human Again" on the Special Edition). She was also shown to have read the tale of Cinderella in Belle's Magical World. In the musical (and in the storyboard), she has also read King Arthur.
In The Enchanted Christmas, the book that Belle wrote and wrapped together was the original tale for Beauty and the Beast.
Contrary to popular belief, it's not made clear whether Belle was actually born a peasant, as she implies that she wasn't born in her home village in the opening song, but rather moved there. In addition, her owning books at her cottage implied that she is, or at least was, considerably wealthy (as back in the time period of the film, books were considerably expensive).
In the musical, specifically the song "No Matter What" one of the lyrics had Maurice stating "You are your mother's daughter; therefore you are class ... crème de la crème", implying that Belle was part of the social upper class. This was also supported by Belle having a portrait of her and her mom in the Enchanted Tales of Belle attraction.
Similarly, it was never stated where Belle had moved from other than it presumably being another location in France. The book "Belle's Discovery" as well as the live-action remake would later state that she had originally lived in Paris.

Belle being carried by the Prince near the end of the film is a reference to the poster of It's a Wonderful Life where George Bailey holds his wife.
Belle's blue peasant outfit closely resembles the one worn by an extra during the third act of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), though this is almost certainly coincidence.
In the activity book Wedding Wishes, Belle ended up tossing the bouquet to the Bimbettes.
Belle is the only main character in her village who wears blue. The animators wanted to accentuate how out of place she seems, so they paid extra close attention to her wardrobe, making sure that Belle would be the only member of the town to wear blue, whilst the other townsfolk sported more rustic and earthy colors such as red, green, orange, gray, and brown.
The green and rose dresses Belle wears can be briefly seen stored on the left side of the Wardrobe and displayed to Belle during her first night of captivity when she was asked to join the Beast for dinner.
In the fifth issue of Marvel Comics, when Belle rejects Gaston in the flashback and the triplets enviously note Gaston's obsession with Belle, they state that she doesn't even go to dances at the village. This was a subtle reference to the original tale, where Beauty preferred to stay at home reading good books, which often got her mocked by her sisters, who by contrast liked to go to balls, public walks, and plays.
Although Belle is explicitly stated in the film to have no parallel regarding her looks, it seems that her appearance can be replicated, as Laurette (one of the Bimbettes) managed to disguise herself as Belle well enough to completely fool Gaston in the third issue of Marvel Comics.
Belle is mentioned in the Disney Channel original movie Smart House.
