<html><p>Elsa's name (a variant of Elizabeth) is Germanic for "noble". It could also be a reference to Eliza, the heroine of another one of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales, The Wild Swans.
Elizabeth, derived from a form of the Hebrew name Elisheva (אֱלִישֶׁבַע), meaning "My God is an oath"; in a round-about way, Elsa's name can also mean "promise", as well as "noble".

Elsa was alluded to in the Sofia the First episode "Winter's Gift" by Winter when she talks about a princess who makes ice. She is also directly mentioned by Olaf in "The Secret Library: Olaf and the Tale of Miss Nettle".
Elsa is very fond of chocolate, a trait she shares with Anna.
Another early draft made note of Elsa being the "heir" and Anna the "spare" ("More Than Just the Spare").
Frozen writer Jennifer Lee once made a tweet jokingly suggesting that Elsa and Wreck-It Ralph would make a good couple during the 2013 D23 Expo. As a nod to that, in Disney Infinity, if Ralph and Elsa are introduced to one another, Ralph will tell Elsa that she's "really pretty", and Elsa will reply "And you have a warm heart."
It is stated in the book A Sister More Like Me that Elsa loves geometry. This is shown when she uses her knowledge of geometry to create her ice palace, and describing her snow designs as 'fractals'; an advanced geometry concept for the time period.
Elsa originally wears her hair with a braid as a child, symbolizing her carefree and innocent personality. While growing up, Elsa wears her hair in a bun, showing her confinement, isolation, and repression of her true self, including her magic. When she embraces her powers again after running away, she wears her hair with a braid again, which reflects her newfound freedom to be who she is without hiding her powers. In Frozen II, Elsa continues to wear her hair in the braid until right before she crosses the Dark Sea, when she pulls her hair up into a ponytail. This represents her becoming more free and confident in herself. Upon reaching Ahtohallan, Elsa pulls her hair from the ponytail, letting it flow loose and completely free, as a reflection of her discovering her true calling in life and gaining total acceptance of herself.
According to Jennifer Lee, even though the reason for Elsa's ice magic is never explained except for a mention that she was simply born with it, early drafts of Frozen hinted that the source of the magic may have been caused by a 1000-year alignment between Saturn and other distant planets like Uranus, Neptune, dwarf planets like Pluto, etc. The sequel provides a definitive answer, however.
Idina Menzel had previously auditioned for the role of Rapunzel in Tangled. Although she did not get the part, a Disney casting director recorded her voice, and it got her the part of Elsa two years later. Coincidentally, Kristen Bell, who voices Anna, also auditioned for the role of Rapunzel.
In the trailer (especially in the Japanese version), there are some scenes that did not appear in the movie that was meant to give audiences the illusion that Elsa was the villain. For example, the scene where she fires her magic from the top of the mountain at the camera does not appear in the film, in order to make it look like Elsa was cursing the kingdom and the scene where Anna is in a monstrous blizzard yelling to Kristoff, "That's no blizzard, that's my sister!" The camera pans over to Elsa, who is using her magic in order to make it seem like she was trying to harm Anna. These two scenes actually come from test animation of the scene where Anna and Kristoff jump off the cliff to escape Marshmallow, in which Anna was depicted as scared to jump off the cliff, and Marshmallow was actively trying to kill Anna and Kristoff instead of simply trying to scare them off.
Originally when Anna wanted to marry Hans, Elsa scolds her and says "I may not be our mother, but I am still the queen", to which Anna responds "You're a mean queen!" This line was removed, as it would've defeated the purpose of Elsa's inner vulnerability, as she was not afraid of pulling rank on others.
While Anna's clothes remain brightly colored even into adulthood, Elsa's clothes noticeably become darker, duller, and more restraining as she gradually becomes an adult (possibly to exploit her isolation from her subjects and especially Anna), but starts wearing lighter-colored clothing after singing "Let It Go".
In the beginning, Elsa wears gloves to hide her powers, but when she embraces her powers, she removes them. This is indicative of the symbolism of "the gloves coming off" - a person shows their true colors when they aren't wearing gloves.
According to the book Across the Sea, one of Elsa's recurring sources of amusement is Anna's condescending imitations of the Duke of Weselton.
In Zootopia, a little elephant girl wearing an outfit resembling Elsa's 'Snow Queen' gown can be seen wandering around in Tundratown.
Elsa weighed seven pounds when she was born.
During renovations of the Walt Disney Animation Studios building, beginning in 2014, Elsa was one of the character silhouettes featured on the wall mural.
Elsa's line when disapproving Anna and Hans' instant marriage "You can't marry a man you just met" is a reference to the Disney Princess franchise, and a direct joke/jab at the Disney Princesses created before Merida often marrying their respective love interests not too long after they first met them, specifically the earlier Disney Princesses such as Cinderella, Snow White, Aurora and Ariel.
Ironically, Nancy Tremaine, a character that from Enchanted which Idina Menzel (Elsa's voice actress) previously portrayed, did marry a man whom she just met at the end of said film.
Since the original film's release, Elsa's line "You can't marry a man you just met" has become an extremely popular internet meme.

Elsa might suffer from a combination of post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive–compulsive disorder. This is seen when Anna tries to convince her that they can be as close as they were when they were kids. Although Elsa was tempted by the idea, she becomes frightened after having a flashback of the night she'd accidentally hurt her sister with her powers. Elsa also goes to great lengths to try to not hurt anyone else with her powers, as she does not yet know how to strike other people in the head without knocking them unconscious, or strike them in the chest without freezing their hearts. It has also been suggested that she may suffer from bipolar disorder and/or agoraphobia. The first case of PTSD could have possibly been Simba.
Since Elsa did not have her official coronation as Queen until around three years after her parents died, it is unknown who served as Arendelle's regent during the period of time that interceded the death of her parents and her coronation. Although historically, the next heir becomes ruler after the death of their parent, so although Elsa didn't have her official coronation until later, she may have still technically been ruler during those three years.
Jennifer Lee said the film was originally going to include a supporting character who served as Arendelle's regent before Elsa had her coronation, but he was cut for time.
In the A Twisted Tale book Conceal, Don't Feel, which shows an alternate take on events where Elsa and Anna had their memories of each other erased and grew up separately, a Lord named Peterssen would handle affairs with Elsa until she was old enough to rule alone, so it's possible something similar happened in the film.

According to Elsa and confirmed by Jennifer Lee, Anna and Elsa both serve as the fifth spirit because "a bridge has two sides". While Elsa can be regarded as the "official" fifth spirit, it is her close bond to Anna that unites the Enchanted Forest and Arendelle, specifically with Anna becoming Queen and Elsa staying as the Forest's guardian. This is also supported by the fact that Elsa and Anna were both required to lift the curse, Elsa by discovering the truth and Anna by getting the earth giants to destroy the dam. Having said that, Elsa is more in-tune with the "magical" aspect of the fifth spirit as she was the only one who was able to hear Ahtohallan's calls.
Ironically, however, it was Anna who broke the curse over the forest while it was Elsa who saved Arendelle.

Elsa has never been called the "Snow Queen" on screen, but has been called as such by the filmmakers, and in merchandise.
After the first movie, merchandise refers to her as "Queen Elsa". After Frozen II, however, she is called "Snow Queen Elsa".
After the first movie, merchandise refers to her as "Queen Elsa". After Frozen II, however, she is called "Snow Queen Elsa".
Many of Elsa's songs, such as "Let It Go", "Into the Unknown", and "Show Yourself", take place at night.
In the "Five-Minute Sleepy Time Stories" segment "Frozen II: Family Game Night" Elsa is shown to be good at the game freeze tag because of her power giving her the ability to "catch" multiple people at once.
In Frozen II, Elsa is shown to be bad at charades. Jennifer Lee states that this is because she is still shy and has trouble coming out of her shell at the time. But in the comic story "A Special Charade", which takes place after the movie, Elsa is shown to be able to be able to play the game more fluently, signifying how much living in the forest has helped her.
Elsa never actually wore her Snow Queen dress from the original ‘Frozen in Frozen II, but can be seen wearing that dress in a portrait during the song "Into the Unknown", as well as in some memories in Ahtohallan.
Elsa is indirectly mentioned in Myth: A Frozen Tale by her nickname the "Fifth Spirit" which is also called the "Human Spirit".
In the opening of Frozen II, Elsa's necklace has crystal pieces. This could be a reference to the Spirits of the Enchanted Forest and foreshadowing of her role as one and connection to them as being the bridge between spirits and humans.
In the Once Upon A Time episode "Beauty", Lucy managed to give Ivy the slip by putting a paper bag over a kid dressed up like Elsa's head.
As of the events in Frozen II, Elsa has more animal companions than her sister Anna.
Elsa and Anna have short stories in included in the Tales of Courage and Kindness disney princess collection. In the story she is simply addressed as "Elsa" when being introduced while her sister has the title "Queen Anna of Arendelle", although Elsa is still referred too as the Snow Queen later in her introductory paragraph.
