Video games
Kingdom Hearts II
Timon makes an appearance in Kingdom Hearts II as a resident of the Pride Lands. His role in the game is similar to the film and he is often seen alongside Pumbaa.

He becomes emotional as Simba grows up and teaches Sora, Donald, and Goofy the phrase "Hakuna Matata", which means "no worries". He and Pumbaa try to help overthrow Scar, though their attempts ended up with them being cornered by Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. Luckily, Sora was there to rescue them. Later after Simba reclaims his kingship, Timon advises him to "live for today."

Disney Heroes: Battle Mode
Timon appears together with Pumbaa in the fighting game as two unlockable characters, they are the first characters that go in two since he is always mounted on Pumbaa and throws worms at the enemies including a bombardier beetle which was not present in the movie.

Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion
Timon is one of the captive Disney characters in the game and appears within the phony kingdom of Prince Eric. Simba asks Mickey to find Timon (as well as Pumbaa and Zazu), and once he's rescued, he joins Simba until the finale, in which the captive characters return home.

Other games
Timon plays a role in The Lion King 1½ as one of the central playable characters alongside Pumbaa.

In Disney TH!NK Fast, Timon appears as the guest questioneer in the Pride Lands. He asks a few questions about The Lion King, and then leaves.

A costume of Timon is also a playable feature in Disney Universe.

A townsperson of him makes an appearance in Disney Infinity 2.0.

Musical
The Timon puppet in the musical, stage show.
In the Broadway musical adaptation to the film, Timon appears through the use of puppetry and was originally portrayed by Max Casella.

His role in the story remains practically the same, along with Pumbaa, the only true difference being a few lines and a few gags being revamped such as the hula scene (which is, instead, the duo performing the Charleston).

However, in one particular scene, adult Simba begins wandering off into the jungle, prompting Timon and Pumbaa to follow him until he reaches a river stream, jumping across it with ease and recklessly dares Timon to do the same. Reluctant at first, Timon eventually agrees to, only to fall into the water and end up being horrifically taken down to a waterfall, hanging onto a branch in struggle and calling out to Simba for help, as Pumbaa worriedly watches on. Unfortunately, Simba is paralyzed by flashbacks of Mufasa's death, triggered by the sight of Timon in peril. Eventually, the branch snaps, but Simba still manages to rescue his friend, just in time; feeling extreme guilt for nearly causing yet another death because of his foolishness.

Disney Parks

Timon appears in the Disney parks as a meetable character. He was a very common walk around character who was usually seen with Rafiki. As of 2011, though, he now mostly only appears at Disneyland Paris and very rarely shows up at Walt Disney World and Hong Kong Disneyland.

Timon and Pumbaa also appear as mascots for the Disney theme parks by hosting for park safety as a good way to help theme park guests figure out what to do and what not to do when being checked by cast members and park security. You can see their images on the posters for the entrances and exists for the park.

Disneyland Resort
Timon makes daily appearances at Disney California Adventure's live show Disney Junior Dance Party, representing The Lion Guard.

Walt Disney World
In Disney's Animal Kingdom
Timon appears in Mickey's Jingle Jungle Parade during Christmas time. He can also be found in The Oasis for meet-and-greets.

In Festival of The Lion King, Timon is the host and tells tales of The Lion King. In the show, Timon along with Simba and Pumbaa, host a series of songs and stunts, accompanied by a pack of monkeys who perform different stunts and tricks and are a pain in the neck according to Timon.

In Fantasmic!, Timon appears during the bubble montage in Disney Hollywood Studios'.

Timon makes daily appearances at Disney's Hollywood Studios's live show Disney Junior Dance Party, representing The Lion Guard.

In the Epcot show, Circle of Life: An Environmental Fable, Timon and Pumbaa are planning on building "Hakuna Matata Lakeside Village Resort" in the jungle by damming the river and draining a nearby watering hole. This prompts Simba to show them another species whose actions have affected the environment for the worse - humans. It is mentioned there that Timon does not like profanity, as when Pumbaa uses the word "dam" as an exclamation (referring to a big dam), Timon mistakes it for a profane heterograph (a differently-spelled homophone) and tells him to watch his language.

In Once Upon a Time at the Magic Kingdom, Timon briefly appears alongside Simba and Pumbaa during Mrs. Potts' opening narration.

In Happily Ever After, Timon along with Pumbaa appear breifly during the Hakuna Matata scene.

Shanghai Disneyland
Timon makes meet-and-greet appearances in the park, is featured in the resort's production of The Lion King musical, and also makes an appearance during Ignite the Dream.

Disney Cruise Line
Timon and Pumbaa are featured on the Disney Fantasy cruise ship's Wishes, about three high school graduates who meet various Disney characters on their biggest adventure ever. Timon and Pumbaa are the first of the characters to be introduced and sing "Hakuna Matata" to teach the kids to loosen up and be carefree when they can.

Trivia
In The Lion King 1½, Timon is shown to interact with the audience a few times, especially in the beginning and ending non-movie theater setting scenes of the film.
Timon's appearance in The Lion King 1½ compared to other works is appealing in most cases, since also being the central protagonist of this film.
In the first Lion King film, Timon is the only character who stands and walks on his back feet (while meerkats normally walk on all four). Interestingly, he is seen running in all fours at least once in both the first film (exiting the cave entrance on Pride Rock with Pumbaa and Zazu, after the off-screen fight against the Hyenas) and the sequel (in a futile attempt to charge at an outsider with Pumbaa). Moreover, it occurred in the climactic battle sequence of both movies.
It is revealed in The Lion King II: Simba's Pride that Timon is unaware of Scar's death.
Despite the fact that Scar is one of Timon's enemies, they never actually interact with each other.
In an early script for The Lion King 1½, Timon's digging skills would be just fine and there were four bullies that make him leave.
Timon has a polar opposite named Monti. He makes his first and only appearance in the Timon & Pumbaa episode "Kenya Be My Friend?".
He has some knowledge on human technology, such as guns. In Simba's Pride, when he and Pumbaa are cornered by the Outsiders during the battle, Timon jumps on the backside of frightened Pumbaa and comically brandishes the latter's tail like a gun and points it at the Outsiders, warning that "this thing loaded". The Outsiders foolishly fall for it and run away in fear. This implies that in unseen occasions, the beasts of Pride Land have encountered humans with guns (possibly wildlife rangers, hunters, and/or poachers), otherwise, they didn't know the concept of guns.
On the first Virtual Safari, he has some knowledge of the GPS tracking system.
The television series and the Wild About Safety episodes showcase Timon owning several human items, as well as Pumbaa, including an iPad.
On the first Virtual Safari, he has some knowledge of the GPS tracking system.
The television series and the Wild About Safety episodes showcase Timon owning several human items, as well as Pumbaa, including an iPad.
According to the Timon and Pumbaa's Wild About Safety episode "Fire Safety," Timon's address is 500 Buena Vista St., which is the street address of the headquarters of The Walt Disney Company in Burbank, California.
Timon's line, "What do you want me to do? Dress in drag and do the hula?", was improvised by his voice actor, Nathan Lane.
Timon prefers crunchy bugs above all other foods.
In the Spanish version of the play, he speaks with an Andalusian accent.
A monkey resembling Timon makes a cameo in The Jungle Book 2, along with a warthog resembling Pumbaa, during the song "W-I-L-D".
Timon and Pumbaa were originally supposed to sing the entirety of "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" in a comical fashion, but Elton John decided not to use that version of the song because he felt that it sounded horrible.
In the movie MouseHunt, which co-starred Nathan Lane, he briefly says "Hakuna Matata" in one of the scenes before the auction.
Timon is seemingly from Jewish ancestry, but he celebrates Christmas alongside Pumbaa; his last name, "Berkowitz," is from Jewish origin, he speaks with a Yiddish accent, his mom used the word "meshugenah", and in The Lion King 1½, he sang the song "Sunrise, Sunset", from the Jewish-themed musical Fiddler on the Roof.
