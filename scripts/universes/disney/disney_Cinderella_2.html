<html><p>Cinderella (played by Jessy Schram), (also referred to as Ella) was a maid who wished to attend the royal ball. Her fairy godmother appears to grant her wish, but Rumplestiltskin kills the fairy. Warning her that "all magic comes with a price", he offers her a contract: her wish in exchange for something she will have in the future. She signs it without reading it and goes to the ball. She meets Prince Thomas, and the two fall in love and marry. At the wedding reception, Rumplestiltskin reminds Ella of the contract and informs her that he asked for her first-born child. When she discovers she is pregnant, she tries to run away. But Thomas and Prince James devise a plan to capture Rumplestiltskin. The plan succeeds, but Thomas disappears. Rumplestiltskin vows that she will never see Thomas again until the contract is fulfilled.

In Storybrooke, she is 19-year old Ashley Boyd, a single, pregnant maid. The baby's father Sean Herman, who is really Thomas, is not allowed by his father to continue seeing Ashley. Sean's father arranges for Mr. Gold, who is Rumplestiltskin, to pay Ashley in exchange for the baby. She originally agrees to the exchange, but she later decides to keep her child. She tries to flee town but goes into labor at the city limits. Emma Swan finds her and brings her to the hospital. There, Emma agrees to do Mr. Gold a favor if Ashley is allowed to keep the baby. Mr. Gold agrees to the arrangement. Ashley gives birth to a daughter, Alexandra, and Sean visits the hospital to reconcile with Ashley and to give his daughter a pair of shoes that fit her feet perfectly (a reference to the original Cinderella story). A few months after, he proposes to Ashley and the pair is engaged.

She later begins teaching parenting classes in Storybrooke, as revealed in Season 4.

Cinderella returns in the Season 6 episode "The Other Shoe" where she discovers her stepsister Clorinda came to town and decides she must protect her from Lady Tremaine. She eventually finds an injured Clorinda hiding inside a pumpkin farm. Ashley unties her stepsister's bandage, only to discover there is no wound, and that Clorinda and Lady Tremaine have lured her into a trap. In the flashback, it was revealed that Clorinda was given a rose by Prince Thomas during the ball to congrats her for the secret marriage with Jacob. Cinderella misunderstood this as an act of love confession and felt betrayed. After Lady Tremaine mocked her, she left the ball and accidentally left the glass slippers. It turned out that she had the key to the Land of Untold Stories. Clorinda's vengeance against her stepsister comes to a halt when Ashley reveals the pumpkin farm belongs to Jacob, and that he and Clorinda can still have a chance at happiness. Lady Tremaine brings Jacob in, intending to kill him, but Ashley blocks her. After she is stabbed by Lady Tremaine, Emma manages to heal her in time. While Lady Tremaine serves her punishment under Leroy's supervision, Ashley and Clorinda make up, and the two stepsisters and their beaus later spend time together.

Ashley Boyd also makes a cameo appearance in Storybrooke at the beginning of the first episode of the spin-off series Once Upon a Time in Wonderland. She and Leroy are packing away from the diner when Will Scarlet manages to steal her keys.

Second Iteration
The Season 7 version of Cinderella is the stepdaughter of Lady Tremaine, the stepsister of Drizella and Anastasia, wife of Henry Mills, and mother of Lucy.

Dania Ramirez as Cinderella.
As a child, her mother marries Marcus Tremaine and gains two stepsisters. After the return of Marcus' first wife, Rapunzel, her mother runs away to New Wonderland, having been cursed by Rapunzel. After a near-death experience, Rapunzel shuns Ella after Marcus saves her instead of Anastasia. When Rapunzel kills Marcus, Ella becomes the maid of their manor.

On the way to a ball, she runs into Henry on a motorcycle, destroying her carriage. She knocks him unconscious and steals his motorcycle to the ball to confront the Prince for what he did to her father. With a knife stolen from Henry, she tries to stab the Prince, but couldn't get through with the plan. Instead, Lady Tremaine stabs the Prince to death and accuses Cinderella of murder. She fights her away out of the castle with Henry's help and plans to meet him deep in the forest to escape the land through a portal, but does not show up and instead leaves one of her glass shoes as a sign for him to find her.

Ella later joins Princess Tiana's resistance with Henry, Regina, and Hook. She then follows Alice to New Wonderland with Henry to persuade her to return home, and to find out answers about her runaway mother. When the Dark Curse is cast, she is sent to the Land Without Magic.

In Hyperion Heights, she is known as Jacinda Vidrio, a single mother, and worker at Mr. Cluck's Chicken Shack. When Lucy runs away from home to find her father, Jacinda gets into trouble with her stepmother, Victoria, who thinks she is incapable of raising Lucy. When Victoria demands that Lucy is to stay with her permanently, Jacinda takes Lucy and tries to escape the neighborhood, but is prevented by Officer Rogers and Ivy. Jacinda remains in the neighborhood and continues her job at Mr. Cluck's Chicken Shack. Sabine later convinces Jacinda that they sell her famous beignets at the shop, but after it got burnt down by Ralph, Jacinda buys a food truck for her and Sabine to continue Sabine's beignets business. With the help of Nick Branson, Jacinda gains custody of Lucy after Victoria is arrested for kidnapping Eloise Gardener. After she and Sabine are kidnapped by Mr. Samdi, her memories from before the curse are finally restored, and she later reunites with Henry and Lucy.

Cinderella (2015)
Lily James as Cinderella in the 2015 remake.
In Disney's 2015 live-action re-imagining of the original 1950 film, she is portrayed by Lily James.

In this film, the protagonist is a young woman named Ella whose merchant father remarries following the tragic death of her mother. Keen to support her loving father, Ella welcomes her new stepmother, Lady Tremaine, and her daughters, Anastasia and Drisella, into the family home. But when Ella's dear father suddenly and unexpectedly goes on a trip to an unknown location and passes away in the process, she finds herself at the mercy of the jealousy, ice-cold venom, abuse, and ridicule of her new unloving stepfamily.

The Tremaines began showing their true colors shortly after Ella's father left on his trip when Lady Tremaine persuaded her to give up her room to Drisella and Anastasia―ostensibly as a temporary measure―while she slept in the attic. However, things turned for the worse after her father's death. Eventually, Ella is relegated to nothing more than a servant girl and spitefully renamed "Cinderella" after waking up with her face coated in soot from the attic fireplace. Ella could easily begin to lose hope. Yet, despite the cruelty inflicted upon her, Ella is determined to honor her mother's dying words and to "have the courage and be kind". She will not give in to despair nor despise those who abuse her.

One day, she meets a dashing stranger in the woods. Unaware that he is really a prince and not merely an employee at the Palace, Ella finally feels she has met a kindred spirit. It appears as if her fortunes may be about to change when the Palace sends out an open invitation for all maidens to attend a ball, thus raising Ella's hopes of a second encounter with the charming "Kit". When Lady Tremaine refuses to buy her a dress, Ella fixes up an old dress of her mother's. However, her stepfamily not only refuses to let her attend but proceeds to callously rip apart her dress. This latest act of cruelty breaks Ella's spirit, and she runs to the garden in tears. She encounters an old beggar woman who is really her Fairy Godmother. She lends a helping hand by magically transforming a pumpkin, mice, lizards, and a goose into a carriage, horses, footmen, and a coachman. The Fairy Godmother also transforms Ella's torn dress into an exquisite ball gown with glass slippers; however, the woman warns Ella that the spell will only last until midnight.

When she arrives at the ball, she discovers that Kit is really the heir to the throne. They fall strongly in love, but just as she's about to tell him her name, the clock strikes 11:59. She drops one of her slippers but manages to get home in the rain and hides the other slipper in the attic. When she hears that the prince―who is now king―wants every maiden in the kingdom to try on the missing slipper, she is ecstatic. However, Lady Tremaine, having discerned her identity, demands that she become head of the royal household if Ella marries Kit. She also demands that Ella ensure worthy husbands for her daughters. Ella has never forgiven herself for not protecting her father and is unwilling to let Kit get in her stepmother's clutches. Enraged, Lady Tremaine smashes the slipper and locks Ella in the attic.

The Grand Duke and the Captain of the Guards were about to leave the Tremaine estate, they heard Ella singing Lavender's Blue from the attic. Feigning ignorance, the Grand Duke persists in leaving, but then one of the guards reveals himself to be Kit in disguise and demanded that the singing girl is tracked down. When the captain found Ella in the attic, Lady Tremaine tried to forbid her from trying on the slipper, saying that she is her mother. However, Ella curtly retorted that Lady Tremaine had never been and never would be her mother.

As Ella made her way to present herself before Kit, she drew the confidence and composure she needed from her promise to her mother. When she and Kit finally met face-to-face, she confessed that she was no princess and had neither parents, nor carriage, nor dowry, and asked if Kit was able to take her as she was if the slipper fit her: an honest country girl who truly loved him. As expected, Kit answered in the affirmative, and the slipper fitted perfectly.

Just as Kit and Ella were about to kiss, however, Drisella and Anastasia burst in on them and begged her for forgiveness, going as far as to curtsy to her. The Grand Duke bowed to her as well in acknowledgment. Ella simply smiled at them forgivingly and left the room with Kit. Before she left with Kit for her new life, Ella turned to shoot Lady Tremaine a final long, meaningful stare and finally tells her that she forgives her. At this, Lady Tremaine sinks to the ground in defeat. After Lady Tremaine, her daughters, and the Grand Duke are banished from the kingdom, Ella and Kit marry and share a kiss. The Fairy Godmother narrates that they become the kingdom's most beloved monarchs. Ella continues to "have courage and be kind".

Unlike the animated film, Cinderella here becomes a Queen upon her marriage, rather than a mere princess.

Kilala Princess
Cinderella as she appears in Kilala Princess.
In the manga series Kilala Princess, Cinderella plays an important role in Kilala's quest for royalty. Kilala enters Cinderella's world after getting shot in the back and transferring her conscience into it. While helping Cinderella with her chores, the maid also teaches Kilala how to eat, dance, and walk like a princess. Her mouse friends secretly help her make a dress for the royal ball. After her sisters tear it apart, Kilala confronts them and accidentally loses her Magic Tiara. The Fairy Godmother shows up later than expected and makes a princess gown, carriage, and escorts for Cinderella. Affected by the crown's magic, the Fairy's power will run out sooner than expected if the tiara is still in the Tremaine sisters' hands.

With the fairy godmother's magic, Kilala manages to get to the palace and steal back the tiara before Anastasia can use it to hypnotize the prince. Cinderella and the Prince meet and dance romantically till midnight.

Kilala later receives a clear diamond from the adventure and becomes the next jewel in her magic crown.

Video games
Kingdom Hearts series
Cinderella is one of several classic Disney characters who appear in Kingdom Hearts. She plays a small but important role in the game as one of the Princesses of Heart. Her world was destroyed by Maleficent, but she was taken into captivity.

In Kingdom Hearts, she is a Princess of Heart, so she is among the seven who were captured by Riku and Maleficent. Her role was the same as the rest of the Princesses. She is only found having been imprisoned in a glass coffin in a deep sleep with the other Princesses in the Great Hall of the castle in Hollow Bastion, where Maleficent set up her headquarters. After Sora defeats an Ansem, Seeker of Darkness-possessed Riku, he stabs himself with Ansem's dark Keyblade to release Kairi's heart, destroying the Keyblade and returning Cinderella's heart to her body, allowing her to awaken. When Sora returns later, Cinderella is in the Castle Chapel with Jasmine, Aurora, Snow White, and Alice using her power to try to prevent a massive release of darkness from Hollow Bastion's unlocked Keyhole until Sora defeats the large Behemoth Heartless guarding the Keyhole and locks it. When Sora intends to travel to the End of the World to deal with Ansem once and for all, Cinderella and the other Princesses give him an upgrade to his Fire magic to help him in his quest.

In Kingdom Hearts II, her name was part of the password needed to access Tron's world.

In Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, she reprises a similar role to that of the original animated film. Jaq and a mouse-sized Ventus made a dress for Cinderella to wear for the royal ball since she had to do the chores. However, the two stepsisters tore apart her dress in jealousy and guilt, causing her to rush out into the garden tears. Terra encourages her to be strong and keep the faith, dealing with some Unversed that were attracted to Cinderella by her loss of hope, and then the Fairy Godmother appears and makes her a ball gown and carriage. At the royal ball, she and the Prince fall in love, but she rushes away at midnight before the Fairy's magic wears off, leaving a single slipper behind as she runs. The Prince was determined to find the girl and let every girl in the kingdom try the slipper on to see if it fits. Lady Tremaine locked Cinderella in her room, but Aqua shrunk to mouse-size through the Fairy Godmother's magic and Jaq freed her in time for the Prince to reunite with her so the two found each other and lived happily until Aqua later finds that Cinderella's world has fallen into the Realm of Darkness due to Maleficent's future actions.

Kinect Disneyland Adventures
Cinderella plays a major role in the game, appearing as a meet-and-greet character near the Village Haus restaurant in Fantasyland. When she meets the player for the first time, she gives them a magic wand from the Fairy Godmother as a gift. Cinderella will also ask the player to accompany her to a royal ball and gather some supplies so that she and the mice can make an outfit (male players will get a Prince costume, while female players will get a Cinderella costume). While the mice are making the dress, Cinderella asks the player to find food (buckets of popcorn) for them. She also asks if the player can find more threads. Cinderella also loses her slippers during the game and asks the player to find them for her. Cinderella also participates in the Mickey's Soundsational Parade and Princess Fantasy Faire mini-games.

Other games
A costume of Cinderella is also an add-on costume in Disney Universe.

Disney Parks

Cinderella is a staple character at Disney theme parks around the world. She is often the spokeswoman for "Princess themed" scenes in the various show and parades. Her castle, Cinderella Castle, has become an icon at both Walt Disney World and Tokyo Disneyland and is often used as the primary symbol for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts in general. She is commonly found in entertainment offerings and meet-and-greet sessions.

Disneyland
Cinderella took TV viewers on a tour behind the scenes of the Main Street Electrical Parade during the farewell season.

Cinderella also makes an appearance during the finale of World of Color. In her scene, it shows her transforming into a princess from the Fairy Godmother's magic.

In Disneyland's version of Fantasmic!, she appears on the Mark Twain Riverboat with the other characters in the finale.

Walt Disney World
In Stitch's Great Escape!, Cinderella makes a brief cameo (though only her voice is heard) at the end of the ride where Stitch attempts to woo her at her castle by pretending he is Prince Charming. She quickly shoves him out when she realizes that he is not the prince.

Cinderella used to have a starring role in a Magic Kingdom Castle Show is known as Cinderella's Surprise Celebration. The plot was that she wished to share many special gifts, with a little assistance from Mickey and the gang, with the visitors of the Kingdom.

In the first phase of Magic Kingdom's Fantasyland expansion, the Tremaine château was to be featured as a walkthrough and meet and greet called Dreams Come True With Cinderella. Guests would see Cinderella singing with audio-animatronic birds and mice, the making of the dress, the stepsisters ruining the dress, Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo and Cinderella being transformed into her princess incarnation and Cinderella would then teach guests how to dance or be Knights. This idea was eventually scrapped and the area that it was to occupy is now part of Seven Dwarfs Mine Train.

In Disney's Hollywood Studios' version of Fantasmic!, Cinderella appears in the bubble montage during the princess-themed medley.

Cinderella also has a spell card known as "Cinderella's Magic Ribbon" in the attraction Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom. Also in the Magic Kingdom, Cinderella can be seen in the Festival of Fantasy parade.

In 2016, Cinderella and Prince Charming hosted a ceremony at the Magic Kingdom in which they introduced Princess Elena of Avalor into the Disney theme parks.

Tokyo Disney Resort
Cinderella starred in her own sequence in the Tokyo DisneySea version of Fantasmic!.

Cinderella used to star in a nighttime spectacular called Cinderella's Royal Coronation, which as the title suggests, celebrated her coronation as a Princess.

In Tokyo Disneyland's nighttime spectacular Once Upon a Time, there is a Cinderella segment where guests see the dress-making scene and "So This is Love".

Shanghai Disneyland
In the park's Enchanted Storybook Castle, Cinderella is depicted on one of the walls carving displays.

Cinderella appears during the final montage of Ignite the Dream: A Nighttime Spectacular of Magic and Light. Her iconic transformation sets off the finale.

Disney Cruise Line
On the Disney Cruise Line, Cinderella can be seen in the shows The Golden Mickeys, Believe, Dreams, and Twice Charmed.

Disney Princess
Amongst the general public, Cinderella is often regarded as the quintessential figure of the Disney Princess line-up. A number of official, promotional art pieces featuring the characters (specifically those prior to 2009) would even place Cinderella in the center as an indication of this.

Redesign
Cinderella received multiple changes in her late 2012 redesign.

Rather than its normal strawberry-blonde, her hair is now a vivid bright blonde in color and is primarily parted on the right side of her head and tied up into an elaborate, high chignon. Her headband no longer covers her ears, and she now has individual earrings.

Cinderella's glass slippers are now tinted bright blue rather than being clear like the original glass. The style of her sleeves are now more separated from the actual dress itself and now seem to be made of pale blue organza, as is her long evening gloves.

Her new dress is a simplified combination of a Mantua, Robe à la Française, and a Robe a l'Anglaise with strong influences from 1950s debutante gowns, particularly with the upper half of the dress. Much of the cloth is a now distinct sky-blue color with the pale blue organza overskirt drawn back and pinned up to display the matching petticoat revealed by the frontal opening of the sky-blue gown. The hem of the dress and part of its upper half are decorated with many elaborate swirly designs. The hem also contains designs that resemble the shape of her glass slippers, and the entire ensemble is now glittery.

Cinderella's new dress has unmistakably left behind the lighter blue influence of her silver gown in the original film along with her strawberry-blonde hair in the film and its two sequels, which is now a golden blonde similar to Aurora's and Rapunzel's.

This modified design of her is first seen during her appearance in Sofia the First: Once Upon a Princess.

In the 2021 'Ultimate Princess Celebration' redesign, her hairstyle reverted back to its 2001 style, as well as the original strawberry-blonde color.

Palace Pets
Cinderella's Palace Pets are Pumpkin, Bibbidy, Slipper, Brie, Midnight, and La Grande.

Differences from the source material
Cinderella, coming from one of the most iconic fairy tales of all time, keeps much of her character continuity from the original Charles Perrault story. However, Disney has done some changes:

"Cinderella" was a spiteful nickname which derived from the word "cinder", and her real name was never revealed (although some fans believe it to be Ella). Disney made this her actual birth name (although it was brought back in the 2015 remake).
Many storybooks, such as the Little Golden Books adaptation, did, however, claim her original name was Ella.
Many storybooks, such as the Little Golden Books adaptation, did, however, claim her original name was Ella.
Cinderella bore her stepfamily's abuse patiently and hid it from her father who would have scolded her because he was entirely ruled by his new wife.
Cinderella never had any animal friends. Although, it has been suggested that this was a reference to the Grimm's version, in which Cinderella has friendly birds helping her.
Instead of falling in love with the prince in one night, it was two. The prince had one ball where he met Cinderella and the next night he had a second ball in which he fell madly in love with her. She lost one of her glass slippers on the second ball. Her fairy godmother helped her get ready for both balls by transforming a pumpkin into a coach, six mice into horses, a rat into the coachman, and six lizards into footmen. Two differently colored gowns and jeweled pendants and tiaras were magically given to Cinderella to wear at each ball as well as glass slippers.
In the 2015 movie, the Fairy Godmother only transforms two lizards into footmen.
In the 2015 movie, the Fairy Godmother only transforms two lizards into footmen.
A supper was served at the first ball and Cinderella shared oranges and lemons with her stepsisters and likely at the second ball.
Cinderella simply showed the second slipper for good measure when the one she lost 'happened' to fit her as though it was molded in wax.
Cinderella in the 2015 movie tries to do this, but Lady Tremaine intercepts her on her way and smashes the second slipper. However, Prince Charming still manages to fit her foot into the first slipper.

The stepsisters both pleaded for forgiveness, and Cinderella agreed to let bygones be bygones. The stepsisters also married two lords. No mention of her father and stepmother is ever read off after the beginning of the story which is before the ball announcements.
In the 2015 movie, Cinderella does indeed forgive her stepmother and stepsisters, and they go to live with the Grand Duke (who was then kicked out from the royal palace).

She was named Cinder-clod by the older stepsister due to the cinders that came from sitting in the corner of the chimney but was given the name of 'Cinderella' by the less spiteful younger stepsister.

Trivia
Cinderella's hair color has long been a subject of debate among fans. In the original film, Cinderella's hair seems to be of a light orange tone, classifying her as either a redhead or a ginger as her hair had been officially called burnt orange. In the franchise and in the Disney parks, Cinderella's hair is publicized as bright yellow, making her a golden blonde, although her hair color is orange-like in the films. The most common consensus is that she is a strawberry-blonde, which is blonde hair bearing an orange tint.
In her 2021 design, Cinderella's color scheme is closer to her original appearance.
In her 2021 design, Cinderella's color scheme is closer to her original appearance.
Cinderella's facial features and expression are similar to Alice from Alice in Wonderland and Wendy Darling from Peter Pan although the latter films are released one to three years after Cinderella.
In the third movie, her shoe size is mentioned to be a size 4½ in women's.
The symbolic message of the glass slippers is that Cinderella is so delicate that she can walk in glass shoes and not break them. It is also symbolic of how she can be comfortable in glass shoes, meaning that she can easily adapt to typically "uncomfortable" situations.
Cinderella is often considered the "leader" of the Disney Princesses, having often been positioned in the center of publicity photos. There has been some controversy, however, because she is the second Disney Princess, after Snow White. Some feel that Snow White should be the leader, simply because she was the protagonist of Disney's first full-length feature film, and was introduced to the world 13 years before Cinderella, although others feel that Cinderella's assertiveness, even in her first film, and coping with her abusive upbringing, along with her even greater capacity for forgiveness, gave her more potential to be leader. Despite these arguments, both Snow White and Cinderella's films have been credited for saving Walt Disney's company from bankruptcy in the 1930s and 1950s respectively, though this has also been applied as well to One Hundred and One Dalmatians in the 1960s and for The Great Mouse Detective and The Little Mermaid in the 1980s.
Not counting movie books like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Cinderella is the first Princess to be shown as a child.
Cinderella seems to share a number of similarities with Snow White:
They both lost their biological parents and were replaced with cruel stepmothers whom are both bitterly jealous of their physical beauty.
Both of them were forced to become servants in their own respective households.
Despite the hardships they've faced in life, both of them remained kind-hearted and strong-willed.
Both of them can communicate with animals.
Both of them were aided by characters with good will at their time of need, namely the Seven Dwarfs and the Fairy Godmother.

Cinderella is derived from the French word Cendrillon, which translates in English as "little ash girl".
The only mention of Cinderella's mother was in the first movie when she showed the mice a dress that belonged to her that she was planning to fix up for the ball.
Cinderella never sang a song in her second film. In fact, none of the songs heard in Cinderella II: Dreams Come True, aside from the two reprises of "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" (one by the Fairy Godmother and the mice, and the other by only the latter), was sung by any of the characters. However, she did sing in the third film.
In the movie, when Cinderella's ball gown is produced, the dress appears sparkling silver. However, in the Platinum Edition, most merchandise, this is published in a bright blue shade (most likely to make her dress seems more like a ball gown as opposed to a traditional white wedding dress―which the mistake is shown in the storybook ending when her wedding dress changed into her ball gown). In the Kingdom Hearts series, the ball gown is correctly colored to silver.
In Aladdin and the King of Thieves, the Genie transforms Jasmine's outfit into Cinderella's ball gown.
One of Cinderella's stock poses used for her official artwork and clip art actually only appeared for a split-second in the actual film, right when she receives her iconic ball gown from the Fairy Godmother and twirls around in it, telling her, "Did you ever see such a beautiful dress?"
Cinderella has the same character design as Katrina Van Tassel from The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and the Golden Harp from Mickey and the Beanstalk.
According to Les Harding in his book "They knew Marilyn Monroe", a popular legend arose that Marilyn Monroe was the physical model for Cinderella. It seems that someone within the Disney organization heard a critic say that Cinderella was too voluptuous. This was in 1954, and the reigning queen of voluptuousness was Marilyn Monroe. The fact that Marilyn was not connected to the Disney studio and was all but unknown in 1949 when the movie was in production, did not stop the rumormongers. An actress named Helene Stanley was the actual model for Cinderella.
The moment when the Fairy Godmother transforms Cinderella's torn dress into a beautiful gown fit for a princess is said to be Walt Disney's favorite piece of animation ever. It was drawn by Marc Davis, one of Disney's Nine Old Men.
Cinderella was actually rich at the beginning, even before she married the prince. This was exempted, however, as she was forced to work as a servant.
In the 2015 movie, she was rich until her mother died. When her father marries Lady Tremaine, they both expect to regain their wealth, but her father dies before that can happen.
In the 2015 movie, she was rich until her mother died. When her father marries Lady Tremaine, they both expect to regain their wealth, but her father dies before that can happen.
Cinderella's time period is also implied during the montage where she attends the ball, as gas lamps were seen near the streets of the village that she passed to get to the castle, which didn't come into existence until the 19th century during the Industrial Revolution.
In some stories, Cinderella's real name was Ella (short for Eleanor), and because she would always lie in cinders, her stepfamily would call her CinderElla. However, in the Disney film, "Cinderella" is truly her name by birth. The live-action remake, however, uses the original story's revelation that her original name is Ella, and some Disney-issued storybooks also use this as well.
In the book entitled Disney Trivia from the Vault - Secrets Revealed and Questions Answered by Dave Smith, who is also known to have his own column in the very first Disney Magazine called 'Ask Dave', or the most recent D23 (Disney's community for Disney fans) Website, he said that Cinderella's last name would likely have been Tremaine since her stepmother's name was Lady Tremaine if Lady Tremaine hadn't changed it from the time she wed Cinderella's father.
For her redesign, her hair is side parted. Sofia the First, LEGO, her 2016 Funko Pop! figure and some dolls have her hair parted on the right side of her head.
Throughout the first film, Cinderella's toes were barely visible, almost looking like she didn't have any. This was most likely a result of there being less detail in the animation of the time. However, in every media following the first film, they were clearly visible.
Cinderella loses her shoes three times in the first movie:
When she is carrying breakfast trays up the stairs to her stepmother and stepsisters, she loses her right shoe. She stops and slips the shoe back on her foot.
When the clock strikes midnight, Cinderella has no choice but to leave the ball. Hurrying down the steps that lead to the castle, she loses her left shoe - the infamous glass slipper. The slipper is picked up by the Grand Duke... the rest is history!
After Cinderella weds the Prince, the two depart from the castle to embark on their honeymoon. As the two are making their way down the steps, her left shoe slips off. The King helps by slipping the shoe back on.

"Cinderella Stamps" is a term for false stamps. They were made resembling a postage stamp, but not issued for postal purposes by a government postal administration.
In the Disney Princess Beginnings book series, Cinderella's appearance is based on the likeness of her live-action child counterpart in the 2015 film.
Despite being labeled as the typical damsel-in-distress, Cinderella has shown rebellion and bravery in her third movie. She is also the first classical princess to develop from being "reactive" to "proactive", as proven in both her third film and live-action remake.
