<html><p>Far away from the Imperial City, the phoenix arrives to help protect Mulan from danger. Mulan (disguised as "Hua Jun") arrives in an army camp where she encounters Commander Tung, who tells Mulan that there is no fighting tolerated at the camp. He then asks Mulan to know who she is, to which Mulan explains that she is "Hua Jun, son of Hua Zhou". The next day, Mulan trains with the other soldiers being commanded by Sergeant Qiang. After a tough training, Mulan later showers herself at a lake to clean herself, just as Chen Honghui talks with her about him being equal to her in fighting against the Rourans. The next day, Sergeant Qiang arrives and tells Mulan to report to Commander Tung, who explains that Hua Zhou, her father, is a great warrior who focused on his chi and masters it carefully just as Mulan learns the power of chi. During training, Mulan and the rest of the warriors follow what the inscription on Hua Zhou's sword says in order to fight against the Rouran army and later confesses with Commander Tung about three virtues she should have.

Later, when the Rourans arrive, Mulan participates in the battle against Böri Khan and his Rouran army just as she rides on Black Wind during battle to which far away from the Rourans, the witch Xianniang arrives and confronts and engages in battle and attacks her while the Imperial soldiers continue fighting the Rourans in the battlefield. Seeing the inscription on Hua Zhou's sword and removing the projectile Xianniang threw at her, she then sees the phoenix far from her, and upon reading the inscription again, Mulan rides on Black Wind and decides to return to the army (though removing her "Hua Jun" disguise armor) just as she arrives at the battlefield to which during battle, a Rouran throws a spear at her just as Mulan uses the power of chi to counter the attack which lands back at the Rouran. She then notices the Imperial army attacked by Xianniang, who transformed into thousands of blackbirds attacking the Emperor's army and planning to help her army. Mulan fires an arrow at a Rouran soldier just as the Rourans prepare to attack. One of the Rourans fires a flaming boulder at the snowy peaks, causing an avalanche to engulf the Rourans just as Mulan escorts Qiang, Honghui, and the rest of the army out of the avalanche's path.

Mulan survives the avalanche while Commander Tung tells Sergeant Qiang that the enemy was defeated. Hua Mulan tells Qiang and Tung to forgive him, but they found out that "Hua Jun" was actually Mulan in disguise. After finding out that "Hua Jun" was actually Mulan in disguise, Mulan ends up receiving penalties for breaking Qiang's rule as she is banished from the army. Mulan, alone, remembers what Xianniang explained to her that she can never return home for disgracing someone just as Mulan faces her. Xianniang explains to Mulan to merge the path with her just as she explains that Böri Khan has survived the avalanche and has taken over the Imperial City, to which Mulan must stop him before the Emperor falls. Mulan rides on Black Wind to return to alert Commander Tung that Böri Khan has survived the avalanche and has started attacking the Imperial City. Mulan convinces Tung to believe in her, even though she was banished from the army to which they refused to believe in her at first but ended gaining faith upon trusting Mulan's warning just as the army decides to follow Mulan to the Imperial City to find Böri Khan and stop him from killing the Emperor.

During the ambush, Mulan fights against a couple of Rourans along with the Imperial army. Just as she closes the door so no Rourans can burst into the palace, Mulan tries to ask the Emperor about a warning she told, only to find Xianniang on his throne. As Xianniang transforms into a falcon, Mulan chases her as the Imperial army continues fighting against the Rourans. Arriving at the guards' post where Böri Khan is, Mulan notices Xianniang dying at the hands of the Rouran leader. Mulan engages in a duel with Böri Khan but loses the sword she is using into molten lava. The phoenix then guides Mulan to fight against him in a duel while Mulan cuts a rope for Böri Khan to fall off a platform. While Mulan frees the Emperor, Böri Khan has survived and prepares to fire an arrow at her, but the Emperor catches it as he and Mulan work together to throw the arrow back at Böri Khan, killing him.

With the Rourans defeated and their leader dead, the Imperial City celebrates the victory of the Imperial army against the Rourans as an esteemed guest talks to the Emperor, introducing Hua Mulan to him. The Emperor praises her for her heroism for saving his life from Böri Khan and saving the Imperial City from danger. Mulan then pledges an oath to be loyal, brave, and true just as she returns to her family in devotion.

Mulan meets Chen Honghui, who hasn't bid his farewell to Mulan yet, just as Mulan bids Honghui a farewell before leaving for her family. Mulan rides on Black Wind again to return to her family's home just as she reunites with her family once again together. Mulan then forgives her father for stealing his horse Black Wind, his sword, and his armor, just as she explains to her father that she lost the sword during battle. As the Imperial army arrives, Mulan is presented with a new sword for saving the dynasty from the Rourans for bringing honor to her ancestors, her village, and her family. Mulan receives the sword with the inscription reading "loyal, brave, and true" followed by "devotion to the family" written on it just as Mulan has brought honor to her family for saving China for her bravery, just as she is praised by everyone who Mulan met for bringing honor to them.

Video games
Kingdom Hearts series
Due to her world being destroyed by the time of Kingdom Hearts, Mulan did not appear in the first game, while her companion Mushu had escaped the world's destruction. However, by Kingdom Hearts II, Mulan plays a major role in her homeworld when it is restored after the events of Kingdom Hearts.

Reprising her role from the original film, Mulan (as Ping) plans to join the Imperial Chinese Army until she encounters Sora, Donald, and Goofy. The trio decides to enlist with her after learning she was trying to help her family. Despite difficulty fitting in with the soldiers, including Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po, Mulan proves herself worthy when she defeats Shan Yu and his Heartless while saving Shang's life. However, Mushu accidentally reveals Mulan's true identity to him, causing an enraged Shang to desert Mulan and the group, while still fulfilling his life debt with sparing Mulan for saving his life, instead of executing her for violating Imperial law. Afterward, the group learns that Shan Yu is still alive, and are forced to follow him back to the Imperial City when he kidnaps the Emperor. After defeating the villain, Mulan is thanked by both Shang and the Emperor. By the time Sora had arrived back, Mulan had begun hunting a mysterious cloaked man who she believes is an enemy spy, but Sora knows it is a member of Organization XIII. As they followed the cloaked man to the mountains, a Heartless dragon awakes, courtesy of Organization XIII member Xigbar. This forces Mulan and the others to battle the Heartless and defeat it when it confronts them in the Imperial City in the courtyard before the Imperial Palace. Mulan gives her support to Sora when he leaves to continue his journey to find Riku and Kairi. As a reward for her honor, the Emperor makes her Shang's partner. During the end credits, Mulan and Shang were having a romantic moment in the Bamboo Grove, only for their moment to be interrupted when Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po were spying on them.

Disney Princess
Despite not being a princess by birth or marriage, Mulan is an official member of the highly popular Disney Princess franchise, though not marketed as prominently as other princesses like Cinderella or Ariel. Even so, she remains one of the most acclaimed members of the franchise, often referred to when giving examples of strong Disney heroines.

Redesign
Mulan received multiple changes in her late 2012 redesign.

Mulan's face was elongated very slightly and is no longer as rounded as it used to be. The epicanthic folds by her eyes have also been sharpened a bit to give them a more narrow appearance. Her body type was also changed to a more hourglass shape from her original androgynous figure in the film.

Mulan wears an elaborate, bejeweled gold hair clip, and her now waist-length hair is long and flowing. The material used in her Hanfu dress is metallic-looking in appearance and texture and still sports the same color as her old appearance. In early redesigns, her dress is more reddish with sparkles. Much of her black hair is loose and down instead of having the hair clip.

Her face and the other visible parts of her skin appear to be whitened with powder, with her cheeks touched with rouge and her lips painted red, somewhat resembling a more traditional Chinese bride.

Other early redesigns included her dress being bright gold and dark red instead of green, blue, and yellow.

Palace Pets
Mulan's Palace Pets are Blossom, Lychee, Plumdrop, Alora, Snowpaws, and Chai.

Differences from the source material
Fa Mulan is based on the character Hua Mulan from the Chinese legend. Much like Arthur Pendragon and Robin Hood, the legend has been immortalized in several poems and ballads, and doesn't have a single author. The Disney animated movie made some changes to the legend.
Mulan's surname is spelled using the Mandarin pronunciation for "花", which is "Hua". Disney uses the spelling for the Cantonese pronunciation. Thought in different forms of the poem, her last name has been changed but 'Hua' is the most popular. The live action version uses the Hua surname.
In the Ming dynasty play Mulan Joins the Army and the Qing dynasty novel Fierce and Filial, she takes the name of her aged father "Hua Hu". In the Qing dynasty novel Biography of Extraordinary Mulan, she goes by "Mulan" while masquerading as a man.
According to the Ming dynasty play Mulan Joins the Army, Mulan had a young sister named Munan and a younger brother named Hua Fang (nicknamed Yaoer). Mulan does have a younger sister in the live action version.
Mulan was already well versed in archery, swordsmanship, spearmanship, bojutsu, martial arts, and various other forms of hand-to-hand combat; being taught the increasingly numerous and highly useful trades of self-defense from her father.
In the Qing dynasty novel Fierce and Filial, she left home to battle in the Wei army at the age of seventeen, and returned home twelve years later at the age of twenty-nine.
Mulan gained high merit in her twelve years of fighting as a woman but refused any reward and advisory jobs working for the Emperor that would make her and family prosperously wealthy and rich beyond her dreams. She had desired to return home to take care of her dear father whom she had not seen in twelve long years.
Hua Mulan had no sense of awkwardness and fits seamlessly into society whether she is a feminine woman or disguised as a masculine man.
Mulan actually liked wearing makeup and wearing feminine hairstyles and opted to wear them after returning home from war.
Mulan's identity as a woman was never revealed while in service. Shortly after returning home, her fellow warrior comrades who had served with her came to visit. Though they were stunned to see an extremely beautiful woman instead, and then learned the truth about their good friend and general, and praised her for all she had done for them.
Mulan was asked to be a concubine/lover to the Emperor in the Qing dynasty novel Romance of Sui and Tang, but she denied this offer and instead took her own life before she was charged.

Trivia
Mulan is the only Disney Princess to be of East Asian descent.
Her pink bridal outfit is very often confused for a kimono (Japanese), but is actually the Chinese garment hanfu.
Mulan is the first Disney Princess to technically not be royalty―she wasn't born a princess nor did she marry a prince.
Mulan spends most of the time in her training uniform, her battle armor, or her blue infiltration dress, while in the merchandise, she is shown mostly in her "normal" dress or her pink matchmaker dress.
Mulan is the second Disney Princess to have both parents alive and present during the entire film, the first being Aurora in 1959 and the third being Rapunzel in 2010, Merida being the fourth in 2012, and Moana being the fifth in 2016.
Mulan means "magnolia blossom" in Chinese. It could also mean "wood orchid".
While her name is "Fa Mulan" in the Disney film, in the actual Chinese legend her name is "Hua Mulan", though they are both pronounced similarly (Fa being Cantonese). Her name is "Hua Mulan" in the live action version.
In the Chinese dub, when giving her fake name to Li Shang, she states her full name is Hua Ping. Hua Ping translates directly as Flower Vase, and is modern Chinese slang for a feminine gay man. This is adapted into the Chinese dub so that when Ping is introduced, the others think he is a feminine gay man, and use that as the basis as to why 'he' tries, and fails, to be manly.
Mulan is left-handed, but is seen using the sword in her right hand, so she may be ambidextrous.
Originally, the filmmakers planned to have Mulan join the army to get out of her society. Though the way she feels about society is still present in the movie, it is not made to be the main point. She seemed selfish and unlikable that way, so animators stuck to the traditional way of her saving her father.
Tia Carrere, who later voiced Nani Pelekai in Lilo & Stitch, was considered for the role of Mulan. In fact, Lea Salonga (her singing voice) was considered, but her voice wasn't low enough for Ping before Ming-Na Wen was found.
Mulan was featured in the 100th issue of Disney Adventures Magazine.
When Mulan disguises herself as a man, her eyelashes and double eyelid disappear and her eyebrows grow thicker, but when she dresses feminine, her eyelashes grow back, her double eyelid comes in again, but her eyebrows remain thick.
Mulan touches her hair a lot because animators noticed that Ming-Na Wen did.
Mulan is, by far, the Disney character (hero or villain) with the highest body count ever. The production team had drawn 2,000 Hun soldiers during the Huns' attack sequence, along with 2,000 more horses. Only six Huns survived to the avalanche and only one of them (Shan Yu) is killed later. This makes Mulan's final body count to 3,994 (Shan Yu is killed by Mushu, rather than Mulan, and not a single horse survived).
Mimi Chan did the motion capture for Mulan's martial arts moves.
In the Disney Princess line-up and dolls, Mulan is often shown as being more tanned than the others besides Jasmine, Pocahontas, and Tiana. However, in the new 2013 type line-up and their merchandise, Mulan is shown as the palest one, when it should have been Snow White.
In the Special Edition DVD audio commentary, it is said that though Mark Henn is her animator, Chris Sanders (Little Brother's animator, who later created and voiced Stitch) was the one who mastered her quirky personality.
Mulan is often noted in an audio commentary that she uses her mind to solve problems and with the learning at the camp can use a combination of strength and intelligence.
In the deleted part of "Reflection", Mulan says, "they want a docile lamb, no one knows who I am," which is true throughout the first movie and sometimes between scenes of Qui Gong and Mulan's marriage in the second movie, she claims to have told Li Shang everything.
The recoloring of Mulan's redesign may be due to the fact that red and gold were often considered by the Chinese as the colors of communism or because in ancient China, the royal color was gold and red was the color of luck and prosperity.
All of Mulan's dresses in the first film had a blue bodice and a red sash.
Mulan sings a remix of another song in the play Mulan Jr. called "Written in Stone". She also sings a remix of "Keep 'Em Guessing".
On the cover of Mulan 2, Mushu is holding a ring (probably an engagement ring), but it is never in the movie or given to Mulan, possibly due to Chinese marriage traditions.
Her side of the yin and yang necklace is the yang side, associated with masculinity.
Although Mulan cuts her hair, it remains long in the Disney Princess merchandise.
Mulan is shown in several deleted scenes in which one she is daydreaming of how she wants to demonstrate her adventurous/tomboyish spirit.
Mulan's curtain has white ducks or swans on it.
Mulan and Moana are the only princesses not to have celebrities pose as them for the Disney Dream Portrait Series.
Ironically enough, Mulan's voice actress, Ming-Na Wen, made a cameo appearance in the 2020 remake of the film where she portrays an esteemed guest introducing Mulan to the Emperor which is seen at the end of the film, making Wen the only actress from the original 1998 film to participate in the remake, though as a different character.
