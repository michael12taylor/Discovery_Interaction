Cinderella is the titular protagonist of Disney's 1950 animated feature film of the same name. After the death of her mother, her father remarried, believing that she "needed a mother's care". He died shortly thereafter, upon which she was forced to work as a scullery maid for her wicked stepmother, Lady Tremaine and two stepsisters, Anastasia and Drizella.

Despite the cruelty of her jealous stepfamily, Cinderella remained kind, spirited, and internally beautiful. Her faith and everlasting optimism manifested itself into a Fairy Godmother, whose magic served as a catalyst for Cinderella's ascent from servant to princess.

Cinderella is the second official member of the Disney Princess line-up, preceded by Snow White.

Background
Cinderella was born to wealthy, unnamed parents who treated their daughter with great love. The family resided in a French château, just beyond a small- but powerful- kingdom. Sometime during her childhood, Cinderella's mother tragically passed away, and as a result of believing his daughter needed a mother figure in her life, Cinderella's father remarried a woman named Lady Tremaine, who notably had two daughters of her own, both around Cinderella's age: Anastasia and Drizella. After the death of her father, Cinderella was under the control of Lady Tremaine, whose true colors finally surfaced, showing a cruel and cold-hearted woman. Her selfishness and vanity destroyed both the family fortune and left the once beautiful château in a state of disrepair. While pampering her own two daughters and spoiling them rotten, she raised Cinderella in abuse and virtual slavery. This was a result of being wickedly jealous of the young girl's natural beauty and charm, which she and her own daughters all lacked. This went on for many years, but Cinderella's personality remained sweet, humble, and kind.

Official Description
Development
The Disney version of Cinderella was based on the protagonist of the French version of the tale by Charles Perrault, "Cinderella", written in 1698.

Cinderella was animated by Marc Davis and Eric Larson, but the two animators did not have the same perception of the character, accentuating the elegance of Davis and Larson's opting for simplicity. This resulted in Cinderella being a more complicated character than her predecessor Snow White, due to her duality. As done with other Disney films, Walt Disney hired actress Helene Stanley to perform the live-action reference for Cinderella. She later was asked to do the same kind of work for the characters of Aurora in Sleeping Beauty and Anita Radcliffe in One Hundred and One Dalmatians.

According to Christopher Finch, the author of The Art of Walt Disney:

Voice
About 400 contestants auditioned for the role of Cinderella. Out of all of them, Walt Disney chose Ilene Woods, who worked on the radio at the time and did not know anything about the audition itself. One day, her colleagues Mack David and Jerry Livingston asked her to sing a song from Cinderella, and she agreed. Then, without saying a word to her, friends of Ilene transferred to the office of film at Disney. After listening to the material, Walt Disney immediately decided that he had found the voice with which to speak and sing its main character, and contacted Ilene.

When casting for Cinderella II: Dreams Come True in 1999, Jennifer Hale was selected as Woods was deemed too old to be able to produce the sweetness needed for Cinderella. Hale has been the main voice of Cinderella since the House of Mouse debuted in 2001.

Personality
Despite being raised in toxicity and emotional abuse, Cinderella declared herself independent and strong-willed by remaining kind-hearted and self-loving, unlike her cruel stepfamily, not allowing the bitterness surrounding her life to overtake her and morph her into someone as cruel as her stepfamily. She makes the most of her misfortunes by remaining optimistic of the possibilities of a brighter future, keeping herself preoccupied with enforced housework and friendly bonds built with her pets, birds, and dozens of mice that have found themselves trapped over the years by Tremaine's mouse traps, only to be rescued and spared by Cinderella. In gratitude, the birds and mice would become loyal companions to Cinderella, providing her with company and serving as diligent helpers should something troubling occur. The particular devotion of the mice would ultimately play a crucial role in the young woman escaping her abusive household, thus furthering the example of how Cinderella's evergreen kindness towards others, despite her situation, would ultimately lead to her uprising.

As assumed, Cinderella's primary goal in life was to escape her stepfamily (though her dreams and other goals also seemed to be of romance, especially with the lyrics from "So This is Love" where Cinderella and the Prince sing, "So this is the miracle that I've been dreaming of.") However, as she was under Lady Tremaine's control since her childhood when her father passed away, such a feat proved to be difficult, with the emotional abuse and manipulation having been planted in Cinderella's mind for far too many years, making for an obedient and fearful young woman when faced with Tremaine's wrath; she would typically make attempts to avoid any form of conflict with her stepmother and stepsisters as a direct result of this.

Cinderella is also witty and sarcastic, at least when she is alone, and during those moments she would often make quips regarding her stepfamily's laziness, lack of talent, and over-dependence on her. She is also unafraid to stand up for herself when she feels she's in the right - or at least attempt to do so, especially seen when she stands up for herself as being able to go to the ball, and though she strives to contain her optimistic aura, she can fall into fits of frustration and annoyance quite often. This is seen through her interactions with Lady Tremaine's cat, Lucifer, who she sarcastically refers to as "Your Highness" and "Your Majesty", and openly berates for his cruelty, which mirrors that of her cruel stepmother. Her daily goal is to make the most of her situation, but she never forces herself to bottle up her true emotions in an unhealthy manner; instead, wisely keeping them under control, while also keeping in mind that the future holds brighter experiences. She also is shown to have some degree of common sense, as after Drizella and Anastasia rushed to Lady Tremaine in fear about how Cinderella had allegedly put a mouse in their teacup, Cinderella, hearing the report, immediately deduced that it had been Lucifer who had actually been responsible, and forced him to reveal Gus, allowing Gus a quick escape.

In Cinderella III: A Twist in Time, Cinderella's hard-working ethics, optimism, kindness and devotion are put to the test when she is magically stripped away from her "happily ever after" by a vengeful and then magically-empowered Tremaine and is forced to jump into physical action to restore her happy life and relationship with Prince Charming and save Anastasia from her mother's cruel and vain influence when it becomes clear that she too is suffering. During these events, Cinderella is shown to be cunning, tactical, persistent, and a fierce rival to those who oppress her. With no magic, being forced to rely solely on her intelligence and fearlessness, Cinderella is able to defeat her stepmother, repair her relationship with a reformed Anastasia and retain her much-deserved life of happiness, proving both her independence and strong will.

Physical appearance
Cinderella is a beautiful young woman of average height, slender build, an hourglass figure, and a softly-shaped, kind face. Her skin is fair and flawless, her lips are pink, and her eyes are blue. Cinderella's hair is a beautiful strawberry-blonde (light strawberry-blonde in her childhood) and medium-length with soft bangs.

In her initial appearance before changing to her maid outfit, she wears a light blue long-sleeved collared nightgown adorned with a blue ribbon and black ballet flats from her maid outfit. Her strawberry-blonde hair is tied in two low pigtailed braids before removing the blue ribbons on each side to make it loose.

During the bath scene, when she removes her collared nightgown and being showered by her several bird friends using a wet sponge, Cinderella's hair is tied into a bun.

In most of her appearances, she was seen in a maid's outfit, which consisted of a dark brown bodice with long, light aquamarine sleeves and a brown, knee-length skirt. Her hair was softly tied back into a low ponytail with an aqua ribbon. She also wore a white apron and a pair of black ballet flats. On her occasional tasks, she wore a white apron and a scarf in her hair. At the near end of the movie, the sleeves of her maid outfit changed from light aquamarine to cyan, and her hair is now loose rather than a low ponytail. In later appearances in both sequels, Cinderella's maid outfit sleeves are now pale blue, and her hair remains loose.

For her first ball gown, modified from one that belonged to her late mother, she wore a frilly, sleeveless, pink-and-white dress with pink ribbons and a sash with jade beaded necklace before her stepsisters violently mess up with it after seeing their discarded items being sewn onto it. She also wears red dress shoes.

Her second dress and most commonly seen sleeveless dress is a sparkling light cornflower bluish-gray ball gown with a low-cut neckline, pale cornflower blue bustle, white-capped sleeves, white armpit length opera gloves, a delicate laced white petticoat (or petticoats), and glass slippers topped with sparkly hearts. (It should be noted, though, that the ball gown is often colored light powder blue in merchandise and later productions and was even digitally recolored as such in the original film's DVD and Blu-ray releases.) Her hair is pulled up into a variation of a French twist complimented with a very light cornflower blue band over it with large gems on both ends of the band (in recent merchandise, the two gems of the band have been replaced with diamond earrings). She also wears a simple black choker around her neck.

Her wedding dress consists of a beautiful white dress and petticoat that exposed little cleavage. She uses her hair in a bun (though in the original film, we do not see where her bun is. In Cinderella III: A Twist in Time, we see it as a low bun) with a white tiara and a cap. Her veil is pulled back from her hair. The dress has long triangular sleeves, with a black choker around the neck (a white ribbon in Cinderella II), along with white dress shoes.

In Cinderella II: Dreams Come True, she wore a pink-and-white version of her original iconic Princess dress. While getting ready for the banquet in the same segment, she had to wear was a pink, formal, and rather puffy dress, with an elaborate hairstyle with several pink bows.

The dress she wears to the royal ball she arranges is a sea green/teal ball gown rather like her original, but with a corset attached to a flat triangular overskirt and a spiky-laced white petticoat. She has a simple black choker with emeralds hanging on it. Cinderella wears a more sea green version of her original headband and evening gloves. She also has the same French twist hairstyle from her original Princess dress.

In both "Aim to Please" and "Tail Tail", she wore a blue-and-white version of her maid outfit. During the party in "Tail Tail", she wore a yellow ball gown with the same French twist hairstyle from her original Princess dress.

In "An Uncommon Romance" she has the same maid outfit and princess dress from the original film.

In Cinderella III: A Twist in Time, Cinderella wore two wedding gowns along with her maid outfit. She also has two normal outfits at the beginning of the movie. In her initial appearance before Lady Tremaine altering the time using the Fairy Godmother's wand, Cinderella was seen in her normal outfit similar to her husband Prince Charming's; a light brown formal vest with a pale yellow long-sleeved collared shirt, cream-colored long skirt and brown heels. Her hair is left loose while wearing this outfit. Her other outfit which it was seen in her portrait with her husband, she was seen wearing a similar outfit as the first outfit as her formal vest is brown, her long skirt is gold with a light yellow petticoat as the length of the skirt covers her brown heels and has a matching light yellow tie on the collar.

While wearing her maid outfit when she is about to be banished whilst riding in the ship and being reunited with Prince Charming, her hair is loose to show her full fringes.

As she is about to be remarried by Prince Charming in their wedding, she wears the wedding gown at the end of the first film and was recolored to pale blue. When Lady Tremaine makes a spell on her, escaping away from Lucifer's human form by riding horseback to the wedding and protecting Anastasia when she refuses to marry Prince Charming before the Prince protects them from getting hit by a spell. Her wedding dress was in shreds like her first ball gown in the original film as the long sleeves became short sleeves, and she was in bare feet. Her hair is tied in a bun but in a messy look to show the fringes of her hair.

At the end of the film, her second dress is a white elaborate long-sleeved wedding gown with its V-neck line has three linings to show her cleavage. She also wears an elaborate diamond tiara along with a long sparkling wedding veil and white heels. The edge of the dress skirt from her wedding gown has diamond designs.

In the live-action film, Cinderella's outfits are somewhat different from those seen in the animated original film and its sequels. As a child, she wears a similar outfit from the original film, but is of turquoise blue and wears blue ballet flats.

Her maid outfit consists of a turquoise blue gown, maroon apron, and blue ballet flats. When Ella is exposed to dust and the ashes in the attic, her gown becomes in a moderate sense dirty, and her flats are becoming darkened from ashes, upon which her stepsisters mockingly call her "Cinderella".

When the girls around the kingdom are invited to the royal ball, Ella wears a pink gown that her late mother wore when Ella was young. Her dress is torn by her stepsisters when Tremaine wants to keep Ella at home as a servant. Her gown is modified by her Fairy Godmother and changes into vivid azure.

The glass slippers Ella receives have the appearance of shiny, reflective crystal.

When married to king Kit, she wears a cream wedding dress and white heels.

Appearances
Cinderella
Cinderella in the original film.
Cinderella is a daughter of a widowed aristocrat who gave her every luxury and comfort. Her father, believing she needed a mother's love, married Lady Tremaine, who has two daughters about her age from a previous marriage: Anastasia and Drizella. However, after her father's death, Lady Tremaine reveals herself to be a passive-aggressive tyrant who is jealous of Cinderella's beauty. She, her daughters, and their pet cat Lucifer abuse and mistreat Cinderella, ultimately forcing her to become a scullery maid in her own home. She is notable for being silenced repeatedly by Lady Tremaine, creating the assumption that Cinderella is expected to do chores without speaking out. Her only friends around the château are the mice (especially Jaq and Gus), the birds, Bruno the dog, and Major the horse.

One day, Cinderella receives an invitation to a royal ball at the King's Castle. She immediately delivers it to her stepmother, who tells her she can go―provided she finishes all her chores and is able to find something suitable to wear. After thanking her stepmother, she goes back to her room, where she shows the mice and birds a dress that had belonged to her late birth mother. As of that moment, her most magical experience of all has begun.

She is about to begin fixing her dress when she is unexpectedly called downstairs by her impatient, needy stepsisters. The mice and birds, feeling sorry for her, take it upon themselves to repair the dress for Cinderella. Jaq and Gus find a sash that Anastasia doesn't want anymore, as well as some beads, are thrown out by Drizella and take them to help fix the dress.

Later that night, Cinderella sees a carriage outside the château through a large window. She goes to inform her stepmother that a carriage has arrived to take them to the ball. When Lady Tremaine notices that Cinderella has not yet dressed for the event, Cinderella replies that she is not going, to which Lady Tremaine points out that there are other times Cinderella will be able to attend while smiling wickedly about Cinderella not going to her own daughters, who return the gesture. Cinderella walks back to her room and looks out the castle's window, wondering what a royal ball will be like. Just then, her bird and mouse friends reveal a surprise: they had fixed the dress for her. She thanks them for showing how much they care for her, changes into the dress, and rushes downstairs to join her stepfamily. However, when they see Cinderella, Lady Tremaine compliments her dress and points out Drizella's beads. The stepsisters then fly into a rage in the belief that Cinderella stole their discarded items to use in her dress, and not caring that the dress had belonged to Cinderella's late mother, furiously tear the dress apart until Lady Tremaine puts it to a stop and ushers them to get into the carriage, which they snootily do after ensuring their stepsister can't come with them now to the ball.

The shot of Cinderella's ragged dress being transformed into a ball gown was Walt Disney's personal favorite and iconic piece of animation from his films.
Cinderella is left with her dress reduced to rags as her stepmother wishes her good night before departing for the ball with the stepsisters. At that moment, Cinderella finally reaches her breaking point at having endured her stepfamily's abuse for too long, and the broken girl runs outside to the garden and breaks down in tears, with the mice, Bruno, and Major watching her in sadness. She throws herself onto a bench and begins sobbing at the apparent loss of her dreams, feeling unable to continue enduring the cruelty of her stepfamily through hope and optimism any longer. Shortly thereafter, the magical Fairy Godmother appears on a bench to comfort Cinderella, explaining the latter's hope still reigns strong deep inside her, as the former wouldn't have been able to appear otherwise. The Fairy Godmother then insists that Cinderella attends the ball and demonstrates her magical abilities as she transforms a pumpkin into a coach, mice into horses, Major into a coachman, and Bruno into a footman, before transforming Cinderella's ragged dress into a beautiful, sparkling ball gown, complete with glass slippers. The Fairy Godmother warns Cinderella that all her magic will be undone at the stroke of midnight. Cinderella thanks her, unimaginably grateful for the Godmother's kindness, and quickly jumps into the coach and sets off for the ball, waving goodbye to the Fairy Godmother as she does.

Cinderella arrives at the castle while the ball is still in procession. She walks upstairs to the castle's ballroom, where she attracts the attention of Prince Charming, who is enchanted by her sparkling appearance and walks over to her. He escorts her to the middle of the ballroom, and (surrounded by other maidens in attendance) the two begin to waltz. The two then have some private time together outside (courtesy of the Grand Duke), during which they become completely enthralled with each other and are about to kiss, but then the clock begins to strike midnight, prompting Cinderella, who has lost track of time and also has not realized at this point that she has been dancing with the Prince himself, to leave abruptly, realizing that the Fairy Godmother's magic is about to end, and she needs to flee before everything returns to normal in front of everyone at the castle.

As midnight draws near, Cinderella flees the ball, accidentally leaving behind her glass slipper.
As she runs down the stairs, she inadvertently drops one of her two glass slippers; nevertheless, she jumps into the coach and leaves the castle. At the clock's twelfth strike, the spell breaks, reverting everything back to what it was. After running behind the bushes to hide from the palace guards (summoned by the Grand Duke) who gallop past the pumpkin (smashing it in the process), Cinderella, her dress reverted once again to the rags of her destroyed late mother's dress, apologizes to the mice, Major, and Bruno for forgetting the time before going over her wonderful time at the ball, including her dance with the Prince. Just as she accepts that it has all ended, Jaq and Gus point out a glass slipper, the only remaining object from the Fairy Godmother's magic, on her foot. Cinderella takes off the slipper and thanks her friends and her Fairy Godmother for everything.

Meanwhile, at the castle, the King has ordered the Grand Duke to search all over the kingdom for whoever can fit the slipper, the only clue of the mysterious maiden. Back at Cinderella's château, Cinderella has resumed her duties as a maid. As she walks upstairs, carrying breakfast for Anastasia and Drizella, she overhears Lady Tremaine telling Anastasia and Drizella about the news of the Duke's search for the girl who has lost a slipper at the ball last night and whom the Prince is madly in love with, causing Cinderella, upon realizing that handsome man she danced with was Prince Charming, to become so distracted that she drops the breakfast tray in the process, angering her stepmother. As she obeys her stepmother and cleans up the mess, she overhears Lady Tremaine continuing to tell her daughters that the girl who can fit the slipper will be the Prince's bride, making Cinderella smile dreamily, even when her stepsisters stack clothing in her arms, the sight of which makes them suspicious of her peculiar facial expression.

Cinderella seconds before Lady Tremaine traps her within her room.
Upon hearing that the two have to get dressed in preparation for the Duke's arrival, Cinderella decides that she too must get ready. She puts down the clothes and heads upstairs to her room, singing and humming the tune she and the Prince had sung at the ball. Unknown to her, Lady Tremaine is spying on her dance-like movements and realizes Cinderella was the mysterious girl who danced with the Prince. Jaq and Gus see Lady Tremaine heading upstairs to the tower and, sensing the danger, rush to Cinderella's room to warn her, but Cinderella is too busy preparing herself to meet the Duke. By the time she sees them trying to warn her, she catches sight of Lady Tremaine at the door (through a mirror), but it's too late, as the wicked stepmother slams the door shut and locks it. Having seen Lady Tremaine put the key into her pocket, Jaq and Gus decide to steal the key and take it to Cinderella's room to free her.

A short time later, the Grand Duke and the Herald arrived at the château. While Cinderella sobs in front of the locked door, believing that her dreams of being reunited with the Prince have been shattered forever, Jaq and Gus steal the key to her room from Lady Tremaine. Cinderella hears Jaq and Gus panting up the stairs outside her room and looks through the keyhole to see that the two mice have finally made it to the top with the key in tow, filling her once again with relief and hope, but is again shocked when Lucifer ambushes and traps Gus inside a bowl, along with the key. She pleads with Lucifer to let Gus go, but the stubborn cat refuses, knowing that he is buying time for the Grand Duke to leave and preventing Cinderella from trying on the slipper, as well as wanting to eat Gus as he has been trying to do throughout the movie. When the mice and the birds' attempts to make Lucifer release Gus fail, Cinderella, quickly realizing that Bruno is the only one who can rid of Lucifer, orders the birds to fetch the dog. Bruno quickly arrives and frightens the cat into jumping out of a window, getting rid of him for the time being. Now victorious, Jaq and Gus wedge the key through an opening between the door and the floor, allowing Cinderella to finally exit her room and head downstairs.

The Grand Duke fitting the slipper on Cinderella.
Just as the Duke is about to leave, disgruntled and disgusted by the efforts Anastasia and Drizella tried to get the slipper to fit on their feet and nearly destroying it in the process, Cinderella calls out to him, much to her stepfamily's horror. Lady Tremaine initially tries to dismiss Cinderella as a maid, but the Duke rebuffs her as his orders were to have every maiden in the kingdom try on the slipper and helps Cinderella onto a chair so that she can try on the slipper. He calls for the Herald to deliver the slipper, but Lady Tremaine, in one final desperate attempt to shatter Cinderella's dreams, trips him with her cane, causing the slipper to fly and shatter into pieces in front of the Duke and Cinderella. As the Duke reacts in horror and terror about the King's reaction and it seeming like Lady Tremaine would keep Cinderella in her home forever, Cinderella reveals that she has the other slipper, which she pulls out from her apron, horrifying her stepmother and stepsisters, but filling the Duke again with joy and hope. He slides the slipper onto Cinderella's foot, and it fits perfectly.

Cinderella, along with the mice, Bruno, and Major, is taken to the castle, where she reunites with Prince Charming and becomes his bride and a princess. The King and the Grand Duke happily celebrate their marriage as the newlyweds head downstairs to a carriage that will take them on their honeymoon. As Cinderella walks down the stairs with the Prince, she drops her slipper once again, prompting her to go back for it. The King assists her in putting it back on, and Cinderella gives him a kiss on the head to thank him. Cinderella and the Prince ride off in the carriage, and Cinderella waves goodbye to her mice friends, who wave back at her. As the carriage pulls away, Cinderella and the Prince share another kiss (with the final words in the book, below the illustration of the couple kissing, reading "and they lived happily ever after").

Cinderella II: Dreams Come True
Cinderella in Cinderella II: Dreams Come True.
Around a year after the events of the original movie, Jaq and Gus set off to make a new book to narrate what happens after the ending of the previous story by stringing three segments of astounding stories together, making three separate stories that are titled: "Aim to Please", "Tall Tail", and "An Uncommon Romance".

In the first story, "Aim to Please", Cinderella and Prince Charming return home from their honeymoon, only to find that Charming and the King have to leave once again for royal affairs, leaving Cinderella in charge of a royal banquet that is to be held. Not knowing the first thing about organizing parties or the royal traditions, Cinderella struggles with her new life and tasks as royalty, and she ultimately decides to disregard the old traditions and set things anew, successfully throwing the party in her own unique style.

In the second story, "Tall Tail", Cinderella and the Grand Duke work together throughout the castle to prepare for a festival, while Jaq feels guilt for his inability to assist her due to his size. Fairy Godmother, however, transforms Jaq into a human by the name of Sir Hugh, and in this new guise, he offers Cinderella assistance numerous times, only to fail abruptly when he does and ultimately realizes he's better off as a mouse anyway.

Cinderella and an reformed Anastasia.
In the third and final story; called "An Uncommon Romance", Anastasia falls in love with a local baker, much to the disgust and disapproval of Lady Tremaine and Drizella. Anastasia is told by her mother to never speak a single word to the baker again. Having been watching the whole time, Cinderella comes up with a plan to get her stepsister back with the baker by getting her mouse friends (including Jaq and Gus) to distract him while the birds steal Anastasia's hat and fly off to the bakery with the intention of having her run after them to get it back and reunite with the baker again. The attempt backfires when the mice run into Lucifer (their old nemesis) who gives chase, resulting in a startled horse kicking Anastasia into the baker's shop. Anastasia runs out, breaking down in tears, and retreats to a quiet area in the village. She is found and comforted by Cinderella, who offers to help her stepsister change for the better and win the baker's heart. In the end, not only does Anastasia blossom a romantic relationship with the baker, but a loving relationship between her and Cinderella is also formed, finally accepting one another as like true sisters.

Cinderella III: A Twist in Time
Cinderella in Cinderella III: A Twist in Time.
Cinderella and Prince Charming are celebrating their first anniversary when Fairy Godmother accidentally loses her wand to Anastasia. She immediately takes it to Lady Tremaine and Drizella, who learn the power of the wand and how to wield it properly. After the Fairy Godmother is accidentally transformed into a statue, Lady Tremaine then reverses time to before Cinderella tried on the slipper. By using magic, the slipper is able to fit Anastasia. Cinderella tries to convince Lady Tremaine that the slipper belongs to her by showing her that she has the other one. Instead, Lady Tremaine calls her night with Prince Charming nothing more than a dream and destroys the other slipper. Cinderella is left at the château while her stepmother and Lucifer make way to the castle to meet her prince. Devastated and confused, Cinderella begins to attend to her normal duties, but regains her confidence and decides to meet with the prince herself, knowing he should recognize her when he sees her. Cinderella, Jaq, Gus, and two bluebirds, sneak into the palace and begin their search.

Memory wiped Prince Charming and Cinderella meet.
When she finally bumps into him, however, he fails to recognize her. Heartbroken, Cinderella cries at losing her former love until Jaq and Gus arrive to expose Lady Tremaine's villainy. Upon finding out that Lady Tremaine used the wand to wipe Charming's memory of herself and make him believe Anastasia was the one he danced with, Cinderella forgets her sorrows and jumps into action. At Lady Tremaine's room, Jaq and Gus sneak in to grab the wand. They are almost exposed by Lucifer until Cinderella enters disguised as a maid. Lady Tremaine discovers her anyway, and a chase follows. While Jaq, Gus, and Cinderella evade Tremaine and the palace guards, the bluebirds rush to warn Charming of the danger, hoping to lure him to Cinderella's location for the spell to be broken. Meanwhile, Jaq and Gus hand the wand over to Cinderella just as Charming arrives onto the scene, but before she could flip the spell, the guards arrest her. Lady Tremaine regains the wand and orders the guards to send Cinderella to the next ship leaving the kingdom to have her banished, although she narrowly manages to touch the Prince's hand.

Charming proposing to Cinderella after his true memories of her have been restored.
Jaq, Gus, and the bluebirds meet up with Prince Charming. They explain that his memory was altered (referring to Cinderella as Cinderelly), and he rushes off on his horse to find her before the ship sets sail. He is too late, but narrowly manages to find himself on board, reintroducing himself to Cinderella (whom he calls Cinderelly before she corrects him), and immediately takes advantage of the moment by proposing to the girl, which she gladly accepts. With their love having prevailed over Lady Tremaine's curse, the two return to the palace and explain the situation to the King and Grand Duke. Infuriated, the King orders the Grand Duke and the guards to search the castle for the stepfamily to have them arrested, while other members of the castle prepare for a wedding, which is set to take place that same night. Cinderella is preparing for her wedding with the help of her animal companions, Lady Tremaine and Lucifer appear out of the shadows. Not only that, Tremaine soon summons Anastasia, who is revealed to have been magically transformed into an exact copy of Cinderella. Tremaine explains her plot to have Anastasia marry the prince under her guise. Seeing her apprehension, Cinderella makes an attempt to talk down her stepsister, but fearing Cinderella could conjure a change in heart in Anastasia, Tremaine sends her off to be killed by a human Lucifer.

Cinderella and Anastasia reconcile.
Still, Cinderella manages to escape her death and uses her time to make her way to the castle. Prince Charming and "Cinderella" are ready to marry, but to the real Cinderella's amazement, Anastasia refuses to marry the Prince, having realized that she doesn't truly love him. An infuriated Lady Tremaine tries to turn Anastasia into a toad until Cinderella steps in to defend her, horrified by Tremaine's ruthlessness. Lady Tremaine then attempts to turn them both into toads, but Prince Charming intervenes by reflecting the magic with his sword, causing it to hit Drizella and Lady Tremaine instead. They are transformed into toads and fall into the Palace's basement. Anastasia brings the real Cinderella and Charming together and transforms herself back to normal. Cinderella thanks Anastasia, and the two reconcile, putting their animosity firmly behind them. Together, they restore the Fairy Godmother, who gives Cinderella a brand-new wedding attire. As they are unaware of the twist in time, Cinderella and Prince Charming decline the fairy's offer to restore the timeline, and the two finally tie the knot, and they live happily ever after...again. She subsequently invites Anastasia to live in the Palace with her, which saves her from becoming a scullery maid like Lady Tremaine and Drizella.

Sofia the First
Cinderella with Sofia in Once Upon a Princess.
In the pilot film, Once Upon a Princess, Cinderella is summoned by Sofia's magical amulet after the young princess casts a spell that makes everyone at the royal ball fall asleep. Cinderella explains that when Sofia's in trouble, the amulet will summon one of the princesses to help her. Cinderella tells Sofia that the best way to solve the problem is to make amends with her stepsister Amber. Sofia is reluctant to do so, however, since Amber had treated her harshly since she first arrived at the castle.

Cinderella tells Sofia that Princess Amber was only jealous because Sofia had gained more attention recently and that showing her compassion could help her change her views. She also tells her that she went through a similar thing with her two stepsisters, Drizella and Anastasia, of how their jealousy for her made them cold and cruel as a result of Lady Tremaine's upbringing, and if she had tried to make amends with them, maybe things would have been better for them now. She sings a song with Sofia about her own troubles she had with her own stepsisters called "True Sisters" before departing.

In "Forever Royal" when Sofia is battling Vor inside her amulet, Cinderella appears to Sofia in spirit form along with all the other princesses who have been summoned to help her in her times of need, and they encourage her to be brave and strong for they all believe in her.
