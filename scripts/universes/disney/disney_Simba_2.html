<html><p>Meanwhile, at the gorge, Scar urges Simba to roar like an adult lion to impress him. Upon scaring a chameleon away, he notices a wildebeest stampede occurring across the gorge as Simba grabs on a tree to protect himself from the wildebeests. Simba asks Zazu for help, but Zazu tells him that Mufasa is on his way to rescue his son. Mufasa then arrives on the dead tree Simba is standing on telling him to jump so that he could get him out of the gorge, but a wildebeest runs into the tree, putting Mufasa and Simba in trouble. Mufasa tries to get Simba to safety but ends up getting attacked by wildebeests. Simba then watches his father trying to get help from Scar, but Scar refuses to help. Scar then pushes Mufasa down the gorge where he dies in the stampede, causing Simba to lose his father.

Simba then walks in the gorge by himself looking for his father but finds a lone wildebeest leaving the gorge. Simba does find his father, only to find him lying dead; he then explains that it was his fault in causing Mufasa to die because there were a lot of wildebeests stampeding across the gorge. Scar then arrives telling Simba that Mufasa is dead and exiles Simba, telling Shenzi, Kamari, and Azizi (along with an additional hyena) to kill him. Simba manages to escape from the hyenas during exile and ends up escaping where the hyenas then plan to tell their master that Simba is dead during the escape.

Back at Pride Rock, Scar tells the other lionesses that Mufasa and Simba are both dead since Simba did not come back to Pride Rock at this time as Scar becomes the new king as Rafiki and Zazu hear Scar's plan about this. Meanwhile, in the desert, Simba is shown to be alive, but passes out due to the intense heat as a flock of vultures arrives and prepares to eat him. Timon and Pumbaa manage to rescue Simba. Simba then prepares to adapt to having a new life without his father with Timon and Pumbaa where they teach him "Hakuna Matata" meaning "no worries" to him. Meanwhile, in the jungle, Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa arrive and encounter the animals neighbouring with Timon and Pumbaa where Simba must eat the food that the fellow animals are eating instead of eating mammals (especially antelopes) and birds they see in the jungle. Adapting a new life, Simba then grows up as an adult lion where he spends time with his new friends in the jungle.

Now an adult lion, the animals choose not to play with him because Simba is no longer a cub; however, he helps topple over a termite mound to release a bunch of termites for the fellow animals to eat. That night, Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa look at the stars; while Timon and Pumbaa think the stars are fireflies, Simba explains the stars remind him of the Great Kings of the Past just like what his father told him. Thinking of his father, he feels sad and a part of his mane flies off in a wind. The next day, each animal collects a part of Simba's mane and each of them brings the mane to Rafiki who then realizes that Simba is alive.

Meanwhile, Simba then fights against a lioness who is then revealed to be Nala who has grown up, much to Timon and Pumbaa being disappointed that he might spend time with Nala more than the two. Simba and Nala then fall in love, but Nala explains to him that everyone thought Simba is dead. Nala then urges Simba to return to Pride Rock but Simba explains that he is not the king and everyone will think he is Mufasa returning. Simba then refuses to go back to Pride Rock as Nala leaves to return to Pride Rock by herself.

Later, Simba encounters Rafiki who realizes that he is the son of Mufasa. He takes him to a pool which shows a reflection of Simba and his late father who appears as a spirit. Mufasa then explains to Simba that he must take his place as the new king who controls the Pride Lands as Simba explains to himself that he is the son of Mufasa.

Simba finally returns to the Pride Lands
Simba then decides to return to the Pride Lands thanks to Mufasa's advice, where he, Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa arrive in the deserted Pride Lands. Upon arriving, he discovers too many hyenas occupying the spot and tells Timon and Pumbaa to create a plan to distract them.

Upon locating Scar, Simba notices him attacking his mother and furiously butts off. Everyone thinks Simba is Mufasa, but Simba explains that it is him as an adult returning. Nala then argues with Scar to tell Simba that he is the rightful king to rule Pride Rock as Simba tells Scar to step down or fight against him. Instead of paying attention to Simba, Scar blames Simba to know he is the one who killed Mufasa during the stampede and explains to him if he is really a king or a bad lion. Simba then almost falls off Pride Rock when Scar corners him as lightning hits a dead tree to cause a big fire in Pride Rock. Simba hangs for his life while about to fall into a pool of fire while Scar confesses to him that he killed Mufasa. Simba then remembers seeing Mufasa falling down the gorge, dying in the stampede.

Upon remembering this, Simba manages to save himself from falling into the pool of fire, biting Scar on his mane to pull himself back up, infuriatingly asking Scar how he could betray his own family. Simba then orders Scar to tell the other lions the truth, but Scar refuses to take notice, trying to convince the lion pride that Simba killed Mufasa and now wants to kill him to cover up his crime. However, Sarabi reveals she overheard Scar saying he saw the look in Mufasa's eyes, revealing that Scar lied to the lionesses about not getting to the gorge in time just as Simba calls his relative a murderer. Scar, now exposed for what he truly is and robbed of all composure, summons the hyenas to kill all the other lions and Simba; the hyenas attack Simba while Nala calls the other lionesses to attack the hyenas in order to save him.

As the Pridelanders fight against the hyenas, Simba chases Scar across another area in Pride Rock where he confronts his uncle, telling Scar to leave Pride Rock and never return, but Scar declines to as he explains to Simba that Pride Rock is now his kingdom. Scar then slates some embers in Simba's face as the two lions fight to know who is the king as a big fire rages behind them. Simba courageously fights Scar and knocks him off a cliff. After Simba defeats him, Scar then plans to take revenge against Simba by building a bigger army of hyenas, but the hyenas think Scar wants to kill them as they plan to take down their leader; Scar tries to fight back, but ends up getting devoured alive, ending his tyranny forever.

With Scar dead, all the other Pridelanders praise Simba for defeating Scar while Rafiki tells him that it is time to take his place as the new king. Simba then ascends Pride Rock and becomes the new ruler. Sometime later, Simba and Nala give birth to a new cub whom Rafiki presents to all the animals of Pride Rock.

Other appearances
Simba, as a very young cub, makes a brief cameo in the episode Safety Smart: Goes Green of Timon and Pumbaa's Wild About Safety, in which Timon misunderstands a CFL light bulb as a "cute fluffy lion." Then, an angry Sarabi comes to get back to her son.

Simba also appears in the animated blooper reel featured in the Diamond Edition release of The Lion King. One outtake featured Simba continuously botching the pronunciation of "Hakuna Matata". Another featured Simba trying to wake Rafiki in the midst of their scene during the latter half of the film. The final outtake on the short showed Rafiki accidentally dropping an infant Simba off the ledge of Pride Rock.

Simba (as a cub) makes an appearance being pursued by Scar and the hyenas in the episode "Hyena Havoc" of Disney Crossy Road: The Animated Series.

In Ralph Breaks the Internet, a screenshot depicting Simba, Timon and Pumbaa can be seen around the Sorcerer Hat at the Disney Animation pavilion in Oh My Disney.

In the series finale of At Home With Olaf, a short clip of The Lion King featuring Simba appears during a montage of heartwarming moments from Disney films playing in Olaf's song "I Am with You".

Video games
Disney Heroes: Battle Mode
Simba in his puppy form appears together with Nala in the mobile fighting game, he is mainly the second who has a duo and also attacks with his claws while Nala uses his roar which he did not do that in the original film, his roar weak and the way to roll with Nala are present as important Skills.

Kingdom Hearts series
Simba is a recurring character in the Kingdom Hearts series. In Kingdom Hearts and Chain of Memories, he is featured as the first obtained summon.

In Kingdom Hearts II, he took on a much larger role since he was an ally and party member. This was largely due to the fact that his homeworld, the Pride Lands, was visited by Sora, Donald, and Goofy. His role was similar to that of the film: Nala, along with the trio, encouraged Simba to return to Pride Rock and overthrow the tyrant king, Scar. Simba concurred to this after his father's spirit, Mufasa, rebuilt his confidence. He returned to his kingdom to find out that Scar turned into a Heartless so after a battle, Scar was defeated and the hyenas were expelled, permitting Simba to take his rightful place as king. However, Simba's confidence in his leadership capabilities dabbled when Scar's ghost returned to terrorize and torture Simba. Sora eased his worries and helped him defeat Scar's ghost so that there was nothing holding Simba back anymore, including when the ghosts of Scar fused together into the powerful Groundshaker Heartless to try and take Sora and Simba down, but they were able to defeat it. As a party member, he attacks enemies with his fangs and claws, has good physical stats and, similarly to Tarzan in the first game, he can cure with healing herbs.

In Kingdom Hearts III, Simba returns as a Link summon, King's Flare. This attack brings forth a large fiery Simba with Sora on his back. He attacks by pouncing on enemies with the Firaga Leap and roaring with the Firaga Roar, causing high fire damage to the enemies around him. For his finisher, Simba curls into a ball as fire surrounds him, creating a miniature sun that incinerates enemies in the area.

Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion
As a cub, Simba is one of the many Disney animated characters having been sent to the Wasteland by Mizrabel. He is later found by Mickey Mouse and brought to the Fortress. Afterward, Simba asks Mickey to find his friends Timon, Pumbaa, and Zazu.

Other games
Young Simba also made an appearance in the Nintendo DS game Disney Friends as one of the characters the player has to care for as a babysitter.

Disney Universe also featured Simba as an add-on costumed character. The train that the player(s) ride on in the final level of Upper Pride Lands also resembles Simba as a cub.

Musical
Jason Raize as Simba in the musical adaptation of the film.
Following the success of The Lion King, Julie Taymor created the musical The Lion King.

In this production, we have an insight into events that weren't explored in the original film, as Simba, young and old, is in nearly all the musical numbers. But in the Broadway production, we see a slightly extended role, which includes scenes like Timon being trapped above a lake full of crocodiles, which was Simba's fault; as the situation reminded him of the day his father was killed by his uncle Scar, and sings an additional song called "Endless Night".

Jason Raize plays Simba while Scott Irby-Ranniar plays young Simba in the original Broadway cast of The Lion King. However, after Raize committed suicide in 2004, a new actor had to take his place as Simba in future showings.

Disney Parks
Like most characters from The Lion King, Simba does not appear for meet-and-greets. Instead, he appears in certain shows.

Disneyland
Simba in Mickey's Soundsational Parade.
In California, Simba makes a cameo in It's a Small World, and can be seen as an audio-animatronic atop float for Mickey's Soundsational Parade.

In Disney California Adventure, Simba makes appearances in various renditions of World of Color. In the standard version, he is seen reliving the wildebeest stampede from the film, and can also be seen during the finale.

Walt Disney World
in Florida, Simba appears in Disney's Hollywood Studios' Fantasmic!, during the bubble montage of Disney films and characters.

In Magic Kingdom's Mickey's PhilharMagic, where he sings "I Just Can't Wait to Be King". In the former Magic Kingdom attraction The Legend of the Lion King, the story of the film was retold using animatronic puppets and scenes from the film, and of course, Simba appears in it. In Once Upon a Time, also at the Magic Kingdom, Simba briefly appears alongside Pumbaa and Timon during Mrs. Potts' opening narration. He also appears in the "Hakuna Matata" segment of Happily Ever After.

Simba also has his own spell card known as "Simba's Roar" in the attraction Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom.

Simba is also a prominent character for Disney's Animal Kingdom merchandise and promotional material. Also in the park, Simba stars in Festival of the Lion King, hosted by Timon.

Simba and other characters from The Lion King are also featured in Disney's Art of Animation Resort in Walt Disney World.

Disneyland Paris
An animatronic of Simba as a cub appears in the main park's daytime parade, Disney Stars on Parade on the jungle-themed unit.

Shanghai Disneyland
Simba makes a notable appearance during an early segment themed after The Lion King in Ignite the Dream. The segment goes through Simba's birth during "Circle of Life", his childhood through "I Just Can't Wait to be King", up until his eventual young adulthood during "Hakuna Matata".

Simba also appears on the resort property's rendition of The Lion King musical stage play.

Trivia
"Simba" in Swahili means "lion", so he is named after his own species.
Interestingly, all of Simba and Nala's children's names begin with "K" (Kopa, Kiara, Kion).
In some concepts, Simba is shown with blue eyes.
When the animators were drawing adult Simba, they wanted a little twist for his appearance and personality to be like his voice actor Matthew Broderick.
In one episode of Home Improvement, Randy (played by Jonathan Taylor Thomas) says that he always expected his father to be called a king by everyone while playing with a lion cub doll who resembles Simba. Thomas was the voice of young Simba in The Lion King. In a Halloween episode of the same series, the Taylor home is greeted by two trick-or-treaters dressed as Buzz Lightyear and Simba. Randy gives one piece of candy to the former and seven pieces of candy to the trick or treater dressed as latter.
Simba is the first animated Disney character to have a villain as a biological relative, followed by Hercules and later Anna and Elsa in Frozen II.
Simba's adult mane was supposedly inspired by Jon Bon Jovi's hair.
Macaulay Culkin, Brock Pierce and Elijah Wood were once considered to voice young Simba.
Simba has trouble speaking in other animal languages, especially elephant.
According to Timon in The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar, Simba repeatedly got his claws stuck in logs as a cub.
In "Lions of the Outlands", it is shown that Simba had confronted Zira prior to banishing her and was the victor.
If you look closely at Simba as a cub, he was sometimes seen with whiskers, and sometimes without whiskers.
While not stated outright, it is very heavily implied in the second film that Simba has Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of what he went through in the first film, seeing his father die especially. Simba's nightmare where he relives the stampede and sees Scar turning into Kovu, his violent mood swings and vicious temper, which can be triggered very easily, and his paranoia over Kiara and Kovu are all major symptoms of the disorder.
