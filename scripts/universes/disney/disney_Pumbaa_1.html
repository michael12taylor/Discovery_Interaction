Pumbaa is a major character in Disney's 1994 animated feature film The Lion King and the deuteragonist of the 2004 film The Lion King 1½. He is a gluttonous warthog and the best friend of Timon. Most animals are wary and dismissive of Pumbaa due to his pungent odor, but he remains happy-go-lucky by following a philosophy called Hakuna Matata.

Background
Before Timon and Pumbaa find the jungle, Pumbaa says that he is alone in the world. According to a flashback featured in Hakuna Matata, Pumbaa had problems with gas when he was younger. They mention that Pumbaa once went to a water hole in the savanna but let out very smelly gas, causing monkeys to fall from the trees to the ground because of the stink. When Pumbaa came to drink the water, his smell caused all the nearby animals to flee. For Pumbaa, it was very embarrassing and left him afraid of socializing. In the Timon & Pumbaa episode "Home Is Where the Hog Is", it is revealed that Pumbaa was a member of a warthog sounder, where he had a mate named Sharla. He was banished from the sounder due to his gas odor, which was apparently appalling even by warthog standards, and spent his life as an outcast until he met and befriended Timon.

Development
In the earliest versions of The Lion King, Pumbaa and Timon were children residing in the Pride Lands that grew up with Simba. It was decided that the two would be changed to outcasts; this gave Simba someone to turn to after his exile.

Before Hakuna Matata, Pumbaa and Timon were to sing Warthog Rhapsody. This song was essentially an inside look at Pumbaa's life, as he and Timon taught Simba how to live life in bliss. When the song selection was changed to "Hakuna Matata", it was Timon's backstory that was the focal point, instead of Pumbaa's. However, the filmmakers felt Timon's verse wasn't working, so it was scrapped in favor of Pumbaa.

Pumbaa's secret intelligence came when writing the "under the stars" sequence for the movie. According to Roger Allers, he suggested that Pumbaa's hypothesis about what stars are should be closer to the truth than Timon's. This would imply to the audience that Pumbaa is actually fairly knowledgeable despite his apparent stupidity.

Voice
Broadway veteran Ernie Sabella first auditioned for one of the hyenas. He did so along with his friend Nathan Lane. The chemistry between the two was so strong that the filmmakers felt they would be best suited for Pumbaa and Timon, respectively. They are notably some of the few actors to record their lines together in a Disney animated feature. Sabella once noted that his voice for Pumbaa was partially inspired by actor Michael V. Gazzo's performance in The Godfather. Rice however explained to have got the idea for the lyrics for the song from watching the comedy series Bottom and at one point wanted the show's stars Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson to play Timon and Pumbaa. Canadian actor Seth Rogen was cast in the 2019 live-action remake.

Personality
Pumbaa is a loving, open-hearted character who sometimes shows childlike naivety and innocence that is sometimes confused for stupidity. Though Timon would say otherwise, Pumbaa is actually the true brains of the outfit, having both common sense and impressive knowledge over things from nature to science, which he often tries to teach the more dim-witted Timon, but to no true avail (as seen in the stargazing scene in The Lion King where Pumbaa defines what stars really are). Even so, it is Pumbaa's childish nature that sets the two apart. Whilst Timon can be selfish and greedy, he is still more mature than Pumbaa, overall, thus explaining why he is the de facto leader of the duo, along with the fact that Pumbaa can be very absent-minded at times.

Not only that, Pumbaa is not without his stereotypical dim-witted moments, specifically seen in the television series. For example, in the episode "Boara Boara", he mistook a starfish for an oversized snowflake, and in "Never Everglades", Pumbaa believed he was the mother of a newly hatched alligator, despite Timon telling him otherwise for obvious reasons. He also has a tendency to react literally, such as in The Lion King II: Simba's Pride when he (albeit accidentally) "baby sat" on Kiara with Timon admonishing Pumbaa for the action in a way that implied that such hadn't been the first time Pumbaa did something like that.

Despite his history of being abandoned and possibly even mistreated due to his foul smell, Pumbaa has a strong sense of loyalty and devotion towards his friends, particularly seen when Timon's selfishness gets himself into trouble despite Pumbaa's warnings, thus resulting in the warthog having to save the day, still willing to call Timon his closest companion. This is also seen in The Lion King 1½ when Timon refuses to leave for Pride Rock to help Simba, whereas Pumbaa, believing it is the right thing to do, decides to do it despite knowing he might die in the battle against Scar.

Physical appearance
Pumbaa is shown as an obese adult brownish-red warthog. He has two white tusks along with having buck teeth. He has a black mane, along with having smaller legs with black hooves and fingers. He has a brown stomach with a long tail with a fluff on its end. He also has a pink snout and small ears.

Appearances

After running away from his home in the Pride Lands, Simba passes out due to heat exhaustion. As a flock of buzzards begins to surround Simba's unconscious body in preparation to eat him, Timon and Pumbaa arrive, scaring the buzzards away as part of their game, Bowling for Buzzards. After the buzzards retreat, Pumbaa spots Simba's body. He asks Timon if they can take him in, but Timon refuses because Simba is a predator and also a lion. However, Pumbaa convinces Timon that Simba might be on their side, and they take him back to the jungle. At the jungle, Simba awakens and befriends Timon and Pumbaa. They teach him the philosophy of Hakuna Matata and to eat bugs like them do and offer him a spot in their home. At the same time, they explain Pumbaa's problem, that he has gas problems.

Years later, Simba has grown up and developed a close bond with Pumbaa and Timon. Underneath the joy, however, Simba's past begins to haunt him again, as he feels his father's death was his fault due to his villainess uncle’s manipulative trickery. While stargazing, Pumbaa asks Timon what the "sparkly dots" are, Timon says they are fireflies, though Pumbaa reveals that he thought they were balls of gas burning billions of miles away (which is technically true since stars are balls of gas burning billions of miles from Earth), when they ask Simba what he thinks they are, he says that someone told him that great kings of the past are up there watching out on them, much to Pumbaa and Timon's amusement.

One day, while bug hunting, Pumbaa is spotted by a hungry lioness, and a chase begins. Pumbaa gets stuck in a raised tree root, and desperately tries to break free. Timon arrives and attempts to save his friend but to no avail. Simba suddenly arrives and battles the lioness. After the battle was over, the lioness reveals herself to be Nala, Simba's childhood friend. Pumbaa and Timon are introduced to her and learn that Simba is a king and that his uncle Scar has taken control of his kingdom during his absence. Timon, however, feels that Nala will destroy the Hakuna Matata trio, getting Pumbaa to believe so as well.

Later on, Pumbaa and Timon are woken up by Nala, who is looking for Simba. Rafiki, Simba's mandrill friend, appears and tells them that Simba has returned home to reclaim his throne. At Pride Rock, he and Timon dance the hula to distract the hyenas so that Simba and Nala could get by, and Simba would have a clear shot at Scar. With Simba and the other lionesses engaging hyenas after Scar confessed at what he had done to Mufasa to the pride, Timon and Pumbaa both charged into battle in the same way they did with buzzards in an attempt to fight them off. During the fight, Pumbaa comes to Timon and Zazu's rescue, expressing anger when Banzai called him a pig, charging straight at him and Shenzi before easily thrashing and chasing the both of them out of the den.

After Scar's death, Timon and Pumbaa watch Simba ascend the throne of Pride Rock, destined to him years before. They are then seen at the end of the film, being present at the presentation of Simba and Nala's newborn cub.

The Lion King II: Simba's Pride
Pumbaa in The Lion King II: Simba's Pride.
After the events of the first film, Pumbaa and Timon appear to have taken residence in Pride Rock (although the third film suggests otherwise), along with Simba and the other lionesses. Once the birth of Simba's cub finally arrives, Timon and Pumbaa are overjoyed, believing their relationship will be similar to their brotherhood with Simba. However, the duo realizes it might not be once Rafiki reveals the "little guy" is a girl.

Months later, after Kiara has become a playful cub, Timon and Pumbaa are tasked by an overprotective Simba to constantly babysit the cub and keep her out of trouble. The duo spends a morning doing just that, until their childish bickering distracts them from their mission, allowing Kiara to wander off on her own, meeting a rogue lion cub named Kovu once she does. Kovu is the son of Zira, a follower of Scar and the enemy of Simba. Zira eventually finds the two playing together and prepares to kill Kiara until Timon and Pumbaa, along with Simba, Nala, and the other lionesses arrive on the scene.

Forbidden to return to Kovu and more cautious than ever with Kiara's well-being, Simba constantly instructs Pumbaa and Timon to babysit the princess, all the way through her adolescence, much to Kiara's dismay. At one point, Kovu is taken into the pride after rescuing Kiara, and Timon and Pumbaa are the first to grow a fondness for him. When they hear Kovu is truly working for Zira, however, they immediately revoke their views, feeling betrayed.

Afterward, Kovu is banished, and Kiara rushes out to find him, leaving Pumbaa and Timon worried sick just as a war between the Pridelanders and the Outsiders (Zira's pride) breaks out. Timon and Pumbaa join in the battle, but the war is put to an end due to the efforts of Kiara and Kovu (who officially reforms for the better). In the end, peace and harmony reign supreme, and the Pride Lands become one with the Outsiders upon the death of a bitter Zira. Kovu and Kiara marry, and Timon and Pumbaa tearfully join in the festivities, alongside Zazu.

The Lion King 1½
Pumbaa in The Lion King 1½.
In the third Lion King film, which explains the origins of Timon and Pumbaa's friendship, Pumbaa is the film's deuteragonist. He is first seen in the middle of some grassland, stalking a frightened Timon in the shadows until they meet face to face, horrifying each other. Timon surrenders, believing Pumbaa wants to devour him, but Pumbaa explains he has no desire to eat the meerkat and was merely following him to make sure he stayed safe, being that an animal of his size is rather vulnerable out all alone. When Timon, offended, notes that Pumbaa is all alone as well, the warthog explains he is an outcast, feared by mostly all animals (albeit because of his scent, though Timon believes it is because of his strength). This gives Timon the idea to hire Pumbaa as his bodyguard and escort to Pride Rock, where he hopes to find a new home and a carefree life. Pumbaa accepts, delighted to have an acquaintance for the first time in ages, and the duo heads off, introducing themselves and finding common interests along the way.

Once they reach Pride Rock, they find a massive group of animals gathered around, though the duo is oblivious as to why (the birth of Prince Simba). Either way, Timon figures they would simply walk through the crowd over to a small pond perfectly suited for a meerkat. However, Pumbaa is reluctant to do so, voicing his fear of crowds. Timon scoffs off the apprehensions and leads Pumbaa through the animals, where the warthog fearfully releases his deadly gas, rendering the animals in the nearest distance unconscious (this also causes the surrounding animals to bow as in the opening scene of the first film) and burning Timon's hair. Instead of abandoning Pumbaa, however, Timon embraces the warthog's "special power", much to Pumbaa's surprise and delight, and with the crowd blockage abolished, the duo makes way for their new home.

They arrive, and Timon deems the area all his to enjoy, leaving Pumbaa to feel his assistance is no longer needed, and downheartedly, he sees himself off, until Timon offers him to stay, which Pumbaa immediately accepts. A few months later, Simba and Nala's "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" musical number ends with the destruction of Timon and Pumbaa's new home, forcing them to head out and search again, eventually finding the Elephant's graveyard. They begin to make themselves at home until they find the area teaming with the fearsome hyenas, forcing the duo to search off, yet again, until finding the gorge, where a wildebeest stampede breaks, leading to the duo falling off a waterfall and into a streaming river. They survive the chaos and manage to find land, where Timon voices his desires to give up on finding a new home, planning to return to his meerkat colony and suggesting Pumbaa return to his own home, instead. Sadly, Pumbaa confesses he does not have one stating that he's homeless, eventually revealing to be a homeless orphan. Timon asks if he's all alone in this big empty world and Pumbaa shows his friend sad face and Timon tells that truth and says that he's all alone too and he also comforts his friend, telling him he would stay by his side no matter what, abandoning his plans to return to the meerkat colony for the sake of Pumbaa.

The duo eventually falls into slumber, and the next morning, they find that they were washed on the shores of a tropical oasis paradise, predator-free, and available for the duo to own. Timon excitedly dubs it their dream home, and living with the philosophy of Hakuna Matata, they begin their life of leisure, enjoying their days blissfully lounging, eating grubs, and enjoying each other's company. One day, however, after Pumbaa begs Timon to go bowling for buzzards, the duo stumbles upon an unconscious lion cub and decides to take him in, adopting him, and raising him into adulthood. With Simba, life is even more perfect than before, and their brotherhood is well-beloved, as well as seemingly unbreakable. That is, until a childhood friend of Simba's (Nala) arrives in the oasis, falling in love with the lion and blossoming a relationship.

Disgusted, Timon ropes Pumbaa into breaking the couple apart, but after many failed attempts, they call it quits. However, one night, they find Simba and Nala having an argument, leading to Simba running off to clear his mind. Timon is overjoyed, feeling their Hakuna Matata lifestyle is finally safe until Nala reveals Simba has run away to reclaim his throne back at Pride Rock, in a deadly battle against his uncle, Scar. Timon refuses to assist Simba, feeling betrayed that he left their home for the Pride Lands, but Pumbaa disagrees, feeling Simba is their friend, and it is their job to help and protect him. After an argument, Timon continues to stand his ground, declaring he will not leave the oasis and lose everything he has come so far for. Heartbroken by the split, Pumbaa heads off alone to help Simba, leaving Timon in supposed solitude.

As Pumbaa nears Pride Rock, Timon suddenly appears, apologizing for his selfishness and exclaiming "Friends stick together 'til the end!", thus rekindling the bond between the duo. Together, they rush into battle, holding off the hyena henchmen of Scar, whilst Simba battles the tyrant. With the help of Timon's mother and uncle, Max (who has been searching for the meerkat since he left the colony), as well as Timon's quick thinking, they manage to hold off the hyenas long enough for Simba to defeat Scar and reclaim the throne. A celebration is held for the new king, who thanks, Timon and Pumbaa for all they have done, confessing he would not have been able to do so without their help. The duo watches proudly as Simba claims his place as the Lion King, and eventually return to the sanctuary that is the oasis, along with Timon's meerkat colony, who have longed desired life without tunnels and the fear of predators, making the oasis the perfect home.

Timon & Pumbaa
Pumbaa in The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa.
In the television series, he and Timon are once again the main characters and are shown to travel a lot and have had many adventures. These adventures are usually due to the fact that Pumbaa always wants to do the right things all the time. In the series, Pumbaa seems to, as usual, be the brains of the duo while Timon thinks and tells that he is. In the show, it is also shown that Pumbaa is very popular among the jungle and usually gains the chance to live the glamorous life, but gives it up for Timon.

Two episodes revealed that Pumbaa's last name is Smith. This was likely meant as a joke due to how incredibly common Smith is a surname. 

In the episode "Russia Hour", Pumbaa is shown to have an uncle named Boaris, who is very famous in Russia due to his ballet dancing skills. But then, before Boaris' farewell performance, he falls on fish eggs due to Timon throwing it on the ground and goes to the hospital, leaving it up to Pumbaa to perform in his uncle's place. Pumbaa, however, breaks his leg, and Timon is forced to stall. But then, Boaris, presumably recovered from his injury, shows up and does his final performance.

In "Sense & Senegambia", Pumbaa is also revealed to have a deceased uncle named Ernie, who is likely named after his voice actor. In that same episode, Pumbaa believes he lost his bug-hunting skills after failing to catch and eat a cricket. Timon thinks this is because there is something wrong with the warthog's senses and so he purchases expensive aids for his friend. Pumbaa later learns from his dream of talking to Uncle Ernie that he needs to believe in himself and therefore, he regains his confidence and succeeds in catching bugs. In another episode "New Guinea Pig", it is shown that Pumbaa's tusks can get in his way of doing some activities or passing through some things. As a result, Pumbaa starts to get tired of them and considers trading them to the three natives. The warthog later realizes how useful his tusks are, as he uses them to free Timon and create an ice replica of himself. Pumbaa learns from Timon that his tusks are the most important parts of what makes him who he is. Also, years before the episode "Madagascar About You", an arranged marriage has been set up for Pumbaa before he was even born.

House of Mouse
Pumbaa with Timon in House of Mouse.
In House of Mouse, Pumbaa makes numerous appearances as one of the recurring guests. A running gag in the show is when Timon attempts to eat Jiminy Cricket, but is stopped by Pumbaa. In "Timon and Pumbaa", Pumbaa became best friends with Donald Duck after an argument with Timon. Pumbaa wanted to do comedy for their performance on stage, but Timon wanted to do magic. In the end, they were reunited after Timon took up for him when it was proven he was not a very good comedian.

In "Donald's Pumbaa Prank", Pumbaa was kidnapped by Pete in a plan to stink up the House of Mouse with his fart-gas, but he was rescued by Donald in the end. In "The Three Caballeros", Pumbaa was the only guest to know the third member of the Caballeros was Donald Duck. In "House of Scrooge", Timon grew tired of Scrooge McDuck's cheap entertainment (His Number One Dime), but Pumbaa wanted to stay because it was shiny.

In one episode, Pumbaa and Timon auditioned for a part as the Genie from Aladdin. In "Not So Goofy", Pumbaa wanted to hear Goofy do his signature holler. Unfortunately for Pumbaa, Goofy was acting sophisticated for the night and doffed the mantle.

In the film Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse, Pumbaa informs Timon of what a "humbug" is after hearing Donald being called such, which Timon believed it was a meal.

Timon and Pumbaa's Wild About Safety
Pumbaa in Timon and Pumbaa's Wild About Safety.
Pumbaa and Timon star in a series of educational shorts, following several guidelines to safety and healthy life. Much like the television series, Pumbaa acts as the secret brain of the duo, often providing far more information than Timon does. At the end of every episode, Pumbaa suggests (or sometimes begs) that the duo performs a musical number, reflecting all that they have learned in the adventure. Unlike previous appearances, Pumbaa notices Timon's selfishness, laziness, and insults a lot more often, and is shown to be easily annoyed by it, though Timon would make up a way to forgive and forget. Pumbaa also takes a more serious tone in the shorts as opposed to other roles. However, he manages to maintain his childlike persona in some episodes, most notably in the health episode, and at the end when he insists on a musical number.

The Lion Guard
Pumbaa in The Lion Guard.
Set in the middle of The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, Pumbaa, and Timon are the adoptive uncles and parental figures of a young honey badger named Bunga, living in an area of the Pride Lands called Hakuna Matata Falls. Pumbaa is shown to care a great deal for Bunga and is a loving supporter of all of his endeavors and ways of life. Like Pumbaa, Bunga's bodily scent is considered disgusting amongst most of the Pride Lands' inhabitants, though Pumbaa doesn't mind, motivating Bunga to use his scent to his advantage, as Pumbaa often does.

Pumbaa first appears in The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar, where he and Timon are shown helping a young lioness named Zuri free her claws from a log. The incident prompts Pumbaa to fondly reminisce the days he and Timon raised Simba, as the formerly young lion repeatedly got his claws stuck in logs, only for Pumbaa and Timon to come to his rescue each time. However, before the mission can be complete, Bunga arrives and distracts Pumbaa with his presence, causing the warthog to eagerly turn to greet his nephew and accidentally free the lioness in a rather painful way. Pumbaa is later told that Bunga has ambitions to join a group of Pride Land protectors known as the Lion Guard, but the idea worries Pumbaa, who believes such a responsibility may be too dangerous. Pumbaa's mind is changed when Simba's son, Kion, mentions he wants Bunga to join because of the latter's bravery. This is enough to make Pumbaa proud and fill with excitement; so much so that he accidentally unleashes a bit of gas, causing Kion, Bunga, Kiara, Tiifu, and Zuri to flee.

In "The Search for Utamu", it was revealed how Timon and Pumbaa came to adopt Bunga. While searching for utamu bugs, Bunga, then an orphaned baby, latches onto Pumbaa's leg and pleads to stay by his and Timon's side. Pumbaa finds the honey badger to be adorable and tries to convince Timon to let him stay. However, Timon wants nothing more to do with parenting (having already raised Simba), and makes an attempt to shoo Bunga away, only to have his mind changed when he learns just how much of an exceptional bug-hunter the honey badger is, much to Pumbaa's delight.

In "Bunga and the King", Pumbaa and Timon accompany Kion and the Lion Guard in going into Nandembo Caverns to meet with Bunga and Simba after they became trapped in a sinkhole. Both Pumbaa and Timon are worried about the two, seeing them as their "babies". Bunga and Simba hear the duo and go to them, but find that a large ravine separates them from the duo and the Lion Guard. Luckily, the two are able to jump over the ravine and are greeted warmly by a relieved Pumbaa and Timon.

In "Rafiki's New Neighbors", Timon and Pumbaa have a silent cameo.

In "The Ukumbusho Tradition" Timon and Pumbaa help the Lion Guard practice for the Ukumbusho Celebration.

In "Timon and Pumbaa's Christmas" Timon, Pumbaa and Bunga adorn a tree with gourds. Timon starts to sing "Jungle Smells", but Pumbaa and Timon disagree on how the song lyrics were supposed to be. With the tree nearing completion, Timon turns to Bunga for a star fruit. Once he hands it over, Timon takes it to the top of the tree and snaps it in half, placing one half on the side. But after he places it on the top, the branch breaks, and Timon is sent hurtling towards the ground. Bunga tries to catch him, but fails. Luckily, the rest of the Lion Guard arrive having heard his cry, and Beshte is able to save the meerkat from the fall. The Guard enquire as to what they are doing with the tree, and Bunga points to the star, telling them that it's Christmas. Timon and Pumbaa are shocked when the Guard ask what Christmas is, and Bunga erroneously tells them that it's a holiday his parents made up. They correct him, with Pumbaa explaining how they heard about it. Before Ono can point out a logical error in their explanation, Timon interrupts, informing them of how you receive presents at Christmas. Pumbaa, however, states that it's more of a time to be with friends and family. After the two argue a little over what Christmas is ultimately about, Bunga also mentions Dandy Claws, a character who appears to give presents. With Timon still excited, he, Bunga and Pumbaa tell them about "Christmas in the Pride Lands." However, at the end of the performance, Timon breaks down and admits that Dandy Claws will never visit, and Pumbaa explains how he will only come if you perform a special song known as "The Twelve Ways of Christmas." under the Christmas Tree on Christmas morning. And on top of that, everything from the song must also be present. Timon continues to cry, and neither Bunga nor Pumbaa are able to cheer him up, even though he admits that the presents they bring him each year are always great. Bunga is then lead away by the Lion Guard for a final patrol before Christmas.

On Christmas morning, Bunga excitedly wakes his fathers up at the base of Hakuna Matata Falls. However, Timon refuses to get up, deciding to sleep in to avoid disappointment. Bunga angrily grasps his dad to wake him, and forces Timon to follow him to the Christmas tree, where the rest of the Lion Guard are waiting for him. When he questions what's going on, Bunga tells him that it's the year they'll finally get to meet Dandy Claws, and they start to sing and perform The Twelve Ways of Christmas. After the performance, both Timon and Pumbaa break down in tears. Despite Bunga's fears, they announce that they're crying out of joy. Timon thanks everyone for making his vision come true, but Bunga is upset that Dandy Claws never came. Suddenly, Pumbaa re-appears donning a white beard made of flowers, some leaves and a fruit hat. Pumbaa explains that he knew how much Timon wanted him to appear, so he would portray him that year. But unfortunately, he took so long to put the costume together that he forgot to get Timon presents. Timon, moved by Pumbaa's incredible efforts, as well as the efforts of his friends, tells Pumbaa that it doesn't matter, since not only did he make Dandy Claws appear, he reminds him that they already received gifts from the performance, such as the berries and bugs. On top of that, Timon is overjoyed to be surrounded by so many friends, which he declares to be the best gift of all. They conclude that it's the best Christmas ever, and the animals decide to celebrate Christmas every year.

In "The Scorpion's Sting" Timon and Pumbaa is seen on a cave painting, where it is explained by Bunga how they defeated Scar, despite the others knowing that it was Simba who defeated Scar. Timon physically appears later on with Pumbaa, watching the Kumbuka celebration with the Guard and Makini. The party however is cut short when Simba gets stung by a scorpion named Sumu. Timon and Pumbaa rush to Simba's side, and are later seen sobbing uncontrollably over Simba's condition, to which they don't know how bad it is when Kion asks. Later that evening, Timon and Pumbaa are seen in Pride Rock, watching over Simba with Nala, Kiara and Rafiki. Fortunately for everyone, Fuli and Bunga manage to reach Pride Rock in time with the gourd of volcanic ash needed to cure the king. Rafiki uses the ash to cure Simba, much to Timon and Pumbaa's relief.

In "The Fall of Mizimu Grove", Timon and Pumbaa performed "Tujiinue" during Makini's Mapando Mpaya when the Army of Scar attacks. In the midst of the fight, Scar's spirit appears frightening many of the Pride Animals including Timon and Pumbaa.

In "Battle for the Pride Lands" Pumbaa and Timon were among the other Pride Animals bidding farewell to the Lion Guard as they went on a journey to the Tree of Life for healing after defeating Scar.

In "Return to the Pride Lands" (which took place after The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride), Timon and Pumbaa along with Basi greeted Bunga and Beshte when they returned from their journey. The three of them were celebrating at Hakuna Matata Falls eating Utamu. After Kion gave up his position as leader of the Guard to Zira's daughter Vitani, he and the rest of the former Guard returned to the Tree of Life where Kion married it's Queen Rani with Pumbaa attending.

The Lion King (2019)
Pumbaa in the 2019 remake.
Unlike his original animated appearance, this incarnation of Pumbaa has the same colors of his real-life counterpart instead of his animated incarnation to base him on a real-life warthog.

Pumbaa, along with his partner Timon, is first seen chasing vultures to rescue an unconscious Simba in the desert. Pumbaa attempts to keep Simba as a pet, but Timon warns him that lions like Simba are predators and could eat them. Telling him he's a harmless cub, the two take Simba to their home where they teach him to adapt in a "Hakuna Matata" lifestyle. During the musical number "Hakuna Matata" during his flashback, Pumbaa is depicted as a red river hog piglet instead of an adult warthog in the animated film. Throughout the jungle, the duo introduces the other animals neighboring with them to Simba who tell them to eat grubs instead of mammals and birds, whereas, in the animated film, Timon and Pumbaa live alone. After Simba eats a caterpillar to live with them, the two accept Simba to spend time with them.

Years later, Simba grows up as an adult lion and spends his new life Timon and Pumbaa, and gets used to stop thinking of his late father frequently. One night, Pumbaa and Timon look at the stars which remind the duo of fireflies in which Simba explains that the stars remind of the Great Kings of the Past just like his father told him as Simba thinks of him.

The next day, Pumbaa and Timon sing an extended version of "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" to make sure the other animals are safe from predators. He and Timon also witness Simba fighting against an adult Nala who remembers it is him, much to the duo feeling disappointed that Simba wants to spend more time with her best friend instead of the duo. Pumbaa, along with his partner Timon later witness Simba returning to the Pride Lands as the two follow him to know what is up with Simba.

Arriving at the Pride Lands, Simba introduces Mufasa's advisor Zazu to the duo in which Timon and Pumbaa think the hornbill is a puffin. Upon discovering a large pack of hyenas occupying the Pride Lands, Timon and Pumbaa manage to distract them by performing a snippet of "Be Our Guest" instead of the popular "Hula" scene where they end up getting chased so that Simba and Nala can sneak past the hyenas. During the final battle against Scar, Pumbaa is also seen running from the hyenas and elsewhere in Pride Rock, the hyenas constantly bother Pumbaa as he attacks them.

Later after Scar's death, Pumbaa and the rest of the Pridelanders are very proud of Simba's victory over Scar. Later during the end of the film, Pumbaa stands on a rock along with the other animals neighboring the jungle along with Timon instead of standing atop Pride Rock in the animated version.

In the Aladdin and the King of Thieves, during Aladdin and Jasmine's wedding ceremony, the Genie briefly morphed into Pumbaa, quoting the famous "Hakuna Matata!" line to ease Aladdin's nerves. Genie then notes he just had an "out-of-movie experience".

In one of the Disney parody trailers promoting Lilo & Stitch and spoofing The Lion King, during the iconic "Circle of Life" scene, Rafiki holds up what is meant to be baby Simba, but it is instead Stitch, which Timon announces in confusion whilst sitting atop Pumbaa. However, in one of the film's full-length trailers, they are replaced by a different warthog making Timon's note about Stitch.

He was nearly eaten by Nala like in the film and was captured by Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed, though Sora saved him. He and Timon taught Sora, Donald, and Goofy about "Hakuna Matata", which means "no worries." He was nervous at the climactic battle against Scar since he was afraid of being eaten by hyenas and the like. Later, after Simba reclaimed his kingship, Pumbaa advised Simba to forget his past and show courage when he protected Nala from Scar's ghost, despite his fear.

Trivia
Pumbaa's "problem" was a product of Gary Trousdale, who came up with a gag in which Pumbaa jokingly asked Simba to "pull his tusk".
Pumbaa is called a "pig" by both Timon and Simba, but he does not react negatively either time, most likely because they are his friends and did not mean it as an insult. In the first film, only when Banzai called Pumbaa a pig (although it was not meant as an insult), he did react negatively. This was reflected in a couple of episodes of the spin-off.
His line: "They call me Mister Pig," is a reference to Virgil Tibbs' line: "They call me Mister Tibbs" in the film In the Heat of the Night.
In the Timon & Pumbaa episode "Kenya Be My Friend?", Pumbaa has a polar opposite named Baampu (an anagram of the name).
In The Hunchback of Notre Dame, two men carry a deceased warthog that resembles Pumbaa during the "Out There" song number of the film.
Pumbaa's flatulence is actually Ernie Sabella zerberting on his hand (pressing his mouth on his hand and blowing on it to create the sound of flatulence). Sabella jokingly stated once that he is proud to be the first Disney character to express flatulence.
He prefers slimy bugs to crunchy ones.
Pumbaa has been known to "not do well" in big crowds, possibly suggesting enochlophobia.
One of Pumbaa's defining characteristics is that he often rubs his belly. This is from animator Tony Bancroft, whose then-pregnant wife would often rub her stomach. Bancroft thought that the action would make Pumbaa more "human and relatable."
Pumbaa's name can be seen as graffiti in the Mickey Mouse episode "No Reservation".
