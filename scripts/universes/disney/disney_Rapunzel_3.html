<html><p>In the Grimm story, Rapunzel's hair is cut by Gothel when she finds out about the prince. Either from weight or a hint of pregnancy, depending on the adaptation story. In the film, Eugene cuts Rapunzel's hair to free her from Gothel.
In the fairy tale, Rapunzel was not of royal birth but born a commoner.
Rapunzel was far less rebellious in the fairy tale.
Rapunzel did not own a chameleon in the story.
The parents are never mentioned after Gothel comes to take the baby girl away as agreed upon.
Her love interest was not a thief, but a prince who is never given a name and was stereotypically simply referred to as "the prince".
In the story, there is no mention of Rapunzel using frying pans as a weapon.
Her hair did not possess any powers nor did it glow at all.
In the fairy tale, Rapunzel is a castaway. The Prince must find her even when he's blind from thorns that result from escaping from Gothel lurking in the tower. After some years he finally finds her, and he can see again.
In the original story, Rapunzel's tears restore her lover's sight.
At birth in the source material, Rapunzel's father agreed to give her to Gothel after stealing her rampion for the second time to help his wife.
In the source material, Rapunzel becomes pregnant and given birth to twins, a boy, and a girl.
Rapunzel was a natural blonde in the original fairy tale.
In the original story, Rapunzel was 12 when she was shut up in the tower. In the film, she was only a baby when locked in.
In some versions of the story, her hair grows back after the prince touches it.
The fairy tale character never leaves her tower, not until she is sent far away from it to the desert by Gothel.
Rapunzel was impregnated by the prince, and Gothel only found out when Rapunzel's clothing could no longer fit.
This is from the first edition, 1812. The 1857 edition is changed. In that version, Rapunzel unwittingly asks Frau Gothel why she was heavier to pull up than the prince.

Trivia
Rapunzel was originally going to be voiced by Broadway actress and singer, Kristin Chenoweth, but she was later replaced with pop singer-songwriter and former teen idol, Mandy Moore.
Reese Witherspoon was considered for the role of Rapunzel, while Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel auditioned.
Coincidentally, the latter two actresses would go on to become the respective voices of Anna and Elsa in Disney's 2013 blockbuster, Frozen.

It has never been made clear in the film whether Rapunzel was the name given by her parents or Gothel. But it is believed that her parents gave her name from a plant in the royal garden as mentioned in Inside the Journal.
However, according to Before Ever After, the name was given by her parents, which is also confirmed in the series episode "No Time Like the Past", when Rapunzel and Pascal see a wanted poster of her with her name after being accidentally sent back 10 years in the past.

Rapunzel is the first Disney Princess shown in full computer animation. In fact, she is also the first Disney Princess to make her debut as a computer-animated character. Special software was used specifically to animate Rapunzel's hair because no one had ever animated so much hair before.
Before Mandy Moore was cast as Rapunzel, Kristin Chenoweth, Reese Witherspoon, Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel & Natalie Portman were aiming for the role. However, Mandy Moore was considered for roles in a couple of DreamWorks Animation films, like Shark Tale and Rise of the Guardians. In Shark Tale, she was considered to voice Angie before Renee Zellweger was cast. In Rise of the Guardians, she was considered to voice Toothiana before Isla Fisher was cast.
Animators have said that Rapunzel's hair is approximately 70 feet long and holds about 100,000 strands. Despite having her hair cut and turn brown in the movie, Rapunzel's hair is kept long and blonde in many of the promotional images and in the Disney parks. This also makes her the first Disney Princess to have her hair change color.
While the official movie description refers to Rapunzel having 70 feet of hair, The Art of Tangled, page 66 "Creative Conditioning" acknowledges 5 more: "Detangling 75 feet of hair".
The color purple is often said to be the color of royalty. During the film, Rapunzel only wears purple, which can be a reference to Rapunzel's true royal identity.
At the Disney Princess Fairytale Hall, Rapunzel claims to have painted all the portraits of the other Disney Princesses that guests see when they first enter the hall.
Rapunzel is the last protagonist that animator Glen Keane created before his resignation from Walt Disney Animation Studios in 2012. Keane was famous for animating other protagonists over the years as well, such as Elliott, Ariel, the Beast, Aladdin, Pocahontas, and Tarzan.
Rapunzel not only happens to have an interest in art but also in astronomy as well, probably as a result of her trying to keep track of how long she remained in Gothel's tower since she was kidnapped by observing the nights the lanterns are released from her kingdom to signal her to come back.
In the original trailer, it was planned that Rapunzel's hair, in addition to healing, would be able to move on its own and act like another appendage similar to The Marvel Comics' character Medusa which Disney also owns. However, this never appeared in the film.
Although her feet aren't shown in the short, several promotional artworks made for Tangled Ever After reveal that Rapunzel is indeed barefoot underneath her wedding dress.
Rapunzel has a distinctive meaning to her name; "Rapunzel" is a kind of German lettuce, as in the original German fairy tale Rapunzel's peasant father is stealing rampion for her mother from a witch.
Some Rapunzel wedding media depict her with long, golden hair instead of short, brown hair.
Some Rapunzel crown media depict her with a purple crown instead of the typical gold, platinum, and diamond type.
Rapunzel was originally planned to have a red dress, which was changed into pink. When animation started at work, the dress was then recolored into blue. When the concept was later abandoned, the dress was finalized to a purple dress, which has become the dress color of most variations of other Rapunzel characters, since the flowers of a Rampion (Rapunzel) plant have violet hues.
Rapunzel's favorite food is hazelnut soup, as alleged by Mother Gothel.
A character model of Rapunzel without her dress revealed that the top part of her white underdress (the bottom of the underdress is clearly shown under her skirt) resembles a white version of the bodice of her pink and purple dress, right down to the pink laces, but sporting lace-trimmed straps instead of sleeves.
In the film Enchanted, released three years before Tangled, a foreshadowing reference to Disney's then-upcoming incarnation of Rapunzel was made during the song "That's How You Know".
During renovations of the Walt Disney Animation Studios building, beginning in 2014, Rapunzel was one of the character silhouettes featured on the wall mural.
Rapunzel's statue in "Rapunzel's Enemy" was modeled after some of Glen Keane's concept art sketches.
Rapunzel shares a lot of characteristics with Quasimodo in that both are raised by their film's villain, are kept in isolation in a tower, sneak into the outside world despite the villain telling them that the world is dark and cruel, are inflicted with the cruelty that drives them back, but they eventually discover the wickedness of the villain.
The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Tangled composer/co-songwriter Alan Menken said that he was "painfully aware" of the similarities between Quasimodo and Rapunzel, and that he had to take them in mind while writing "When Will My Life Begin".

Rapunzel was 18 throughout the majority of the first film. However, in the series, it is indicated that "Secret of the Sun Drop" takes place one year after the events of the original film. In "Beginnings", the flashback to Cassandra and Rapunzel's first-encounter is listed as "2 years ago." This means that Rapunzel would be at least 20 years old in Tangled Ever After.
Rapunzel was the third Disney Princess to have an abusive maternal figure, after Snow White and Cinderella.
