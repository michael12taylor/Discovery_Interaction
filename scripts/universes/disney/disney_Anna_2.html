<html><p>Before they leave, Anna finds that Kristoff had run off to deal with matters of his own. Believing this to be another sign of rejection, Anna chooses to leave Kristoff behind for the sake of protecting Elsa. The sisters are guided by Bruni and Gale to the shipwreck of their parents, washed ashore from the Dark Sea. There, they find a note explaining that the monarchs were searching for Ahtohallan to find answers about Elsa's magic. Elsa, knowing that sending Anna and Olaf with her would upset the balance between both worlds, declares that she must journey to Ahtohallan alone to find the voice. Anna insists on joining Elsa to protect her from Ahtohallan's curse and reminded her of their mother's song, "Go too far and you'll be drowned", but Elsa instead sends Anna and Olaf off on an iceboat to keep them out of danger, infuriating both the princess and Olaf. Anna and Olaf find themselves in the Earth Giants' territory but are able to escape through a dark cave while avoiding waking them up.

Anna chooses to do the next right thing.
While trying to find a way out, Anna and Olaf are greeted by an ice sculpture created by Elsa, which depicts their grandfather, King Runeard, attacking the unarmed Northuldra leader from behind. Anna realizes that Runeard's dam was a ruse to wipe out the Northuldra, and that he was responsible for the war that angered the spirits. Anna realizes that, in order to break the curse, she must destroy the dam, which would inevitably flood all of Arendelle. Olaf is able to comfort Anna by finding an exit from the cave, but before they can leave, the magic in Olaf begins to flurry away. Olaf deduces that this is because Elsa had fallen under Ahtohallan's curse and died, thus resulting in his own demise as her magic was now defunct. With Elsa, Olaf, and Kristoff gone, Anna feels lost, but she forces herself to move forward and do what's right: destroy the dam. Anna summons the Earth Giants and lures them to the dam when they come after her for disturbing their sleep. With the help of Kristoff and Mattias, Anna is able to get the giants to toss boulders at the structure, destroying it and lifting the curse.

Anna as the new ruler of Arendelle.
With the dust settled, Anna apologizes to Kristoff for leaving him behind, allowing the two to reconcile. Anna remains crestfallen at the loss of Elsa, however, but is suddenly led to the fjord by Gale, where Elsa stands as the fifth spirit of the forest—the bridge that connects the magic of nature and people, having been brought back to reunite with Anna by the Nokk. Elsa explains that Arendelle had been spared by the spirits thanks to Anna's selfless act. Elsa also declares that Anna, herself, is also the fifth spirit—as a bridge has two sides and their mother had two daughters. Olaf is revived by Elsa's magic, thereafter, and with their family reunited, Kristoff finally musters up the courage to propose to Anna. In tears, Anna accepts, becoming newly engaged. Now knowing where she truly belongs, Elsa remains behind to protect the Enchanted Forest with the Northuldra, while Anna is crowned the new Queen of Arendelle, with Kristoff, Olaf, Sven, and Mattias by her side. At the kingdom square, Anna and Mattias jointly unveil a statue of Agnarr and Iduna, the Arendellian and Northuldra, symbolizing the love and unity between the two sides. Despite her new role as sovereign, Anna continues to make time for her family, and hosts charade nights at the castle, which Elsa always attends.

Other appearances
Along with Elsa, Anna makes a small cameo in the animated mini-series It's a Small World: The Animated Series, in the episode "Little Birds, Frost and Pine", happily building Olaf with her sister in the woods.

While not physically present, the fact that Arendelle is in quarantine in the song I Am with You strongly suggests that she placed the kingdom under a stay-at-home/safer-at-home order to protect her subjects from the novel coronavirus.

Anna also makes a very brief appearance alongside Elsa, Olaf, and Sven in an advertisement promoting Sky Movies, where she is seen on the television after the commercial's host family come back into the real world.

She does so by assembling Elsa, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf on a quest to seek Grand Pabbie for answers. Over the course of the adventure, Anna proves to be the most level-headed and capable of the team.

Live-action appearances
Once Upon a Time


Anna appeared in the fourth season of Once Upon a Time alongside Elsa and Kristoff. She appears in 9 episodes, and is portrayed by Elizabeth Lail.
In a time frame set two years after the events equivalent to the events of Frozen and approximately a year before the first Dark Curse in the general Once timeline, Anna is engaged to Kristoff. In honor of the momentous occasion, Elsa grants Anna both a beautiful new necklace and a gown originally owned by their deceased mother. As Anna tries on the dress, Elsa discovers their mother's diary. Within the text, it is revealed the king and queen left Arendelle because of Elsa. While Elsa believes it's because they feared her and saw her as a monster, Anna believes otherwise. To prove the true reason, Anna takes Elsa to Grand Pabbie. Pabbie is unable to uncover the exact reason the king and queen left, but reveals where they were heading; a land known as Mist Haven. While Elsa still worries, Anna stays positive and suggests they travel to Mist Haven to find out the truth for themselves. Reluctant about the idea, Elsa denies, claiming she doesn't want to abandon her kingdom and fears Hans and his brothers will strike should they leave Arendelle. Unable to convince her sister to tag along and grant permission, Anna secretly boards a ship and travels to Mist Haven, herself, in hopes of finding the truth to their parents' mysterious journey.


After arriving in the Enchanted Forest (Mist Haven), Anna encounters David, as well as the infamously powerful sorcerer, Rumplestiltskin, who play crucial roles in her quest.

At sometimes afterward, Anna arrives home and reunites with Kristoff. She informed Kristoff that her parents did travel to the Enchanted Forest out of fear of Elsa, and they seek to use a box that contains the sorcerer's magical hat to rid Elsa of her powers. When Kristoff asked how she is going to break this to Elsa, Anna says she has no idea what to tell her elder sister.

When she reunites with Elsa, Anna instead lied about her discovery, claiming their parents didn't find what they seek when they traveled to the Enchanted Forest. To her surprise, she discovered that Elsa has more control over her snow/ice magic. Even more surprising is when Elsa introduced her to Ingrid the Snow Queen, their maternal aunt, who also possesses exactly the same abilities. Despite Elsa's claim that Ingrid was a relative of theirs, Anna was suspicious, since their aunt isn't in any of the family's portrait or records. After sharing this revelation with Kristoff, Anna decides to visit Grand Pabbie again to find out their family's secret involving Ingrid. When Kristoff discusses Anna's decision to withhold the truth from Elsa, concerning what her parents did in the Enchanted Forest, Anna decides to keep hiding the truth from her sister until the time is right to tell her, which he supports. After Anna departs to find more answers, she and Kristoff are unaware that Ingrid has been eavesdropping on their conversation the whole time.

Ingrid eventually kidnaps Anna and imprisons her within the castle's dungeon cell. She then admits that she wants a family of people like her and Elsa (magically-inclined), and considers Anna to be the "odd one out" due to having nothing in common with her and Elsa, and not fitting the perfect criteria as the third family member. Ingrid vows to find the perfect replacement and have what she desires: a family that loves her for who she is.

Ingrid manipulates her into thinking that Anna plans to use a sorcerer's hat to absorb all of her abilities. Learning that she is locked up in the dungeon cell, Elsa pays Anna a visit and tells Anna that she doesn't believe their aunt's lies. They now had plans to find the urn and trap Ingrid in it.

As part of the plan, Anna was returned to the dungeon cell, where she'll ambush Ingrid when she comes to check up on her. Unfortunately, Ingrid was onto their scheme, and Anna now found herself in chains and trapped in the cell with her. Ingrid then uses a shard of mirror to place Anna under her spell, the Spell of Shattered Sight, resulting in Anna releasing her inner anger and resentment towards her elder sister. As Elsa is bewildered at her little sister's venomous anger, Ingrid appears and admits she did it to show Anna's inner darkness, causing Elsa to realize her aunt has placed her sister under her spell. Ingrid demands that Elsa freezes Anna to prevent her from trapping Elsa inside the urn; however, Elsa refuses to hurt her sister and holds her arms against her sides. In an unexpected twist, Anna, still under the spell's influence, unseals the urn and traps Elsa inside. As she is slowly absorbed into the urn, Elsa tells her that she will always love her no matter what she does. Recovering from the magic spell, Anna was horrified by what her aunt made her do to Elsa. As Ingrid prepares to choke her to death, Kristoff arrives to save Anna, armed with only his ice pick. With her aunt finally consumed by her anger and overwhelm with disgust at how the couple sees her as a monster, Anna can only stand and watch as Ingrid uses her power to freeze both her, Kristoff, and Arendelle out of pure fury.

Thirty years later, after Ingrid begins to cast her Spell of Shattered Sight in the town of Storybrooke, Arendelle, along with Anna and Kristoff, finally thaws out. While she contemplates on finding and freeing Elsa from Ingrid, Anna found a piece of gold straw on the floor that was left behind by Rumplestiltskin and deduced that he must have followed her to Arendelle and took Elsa from Ingrid while they were frozen. As they start devising a plan to rescue Elsa from Rumplestiltskin, Hans and his brothers, who had recently been thawed out, barged in and declare Arendelle as his kingdom now. As they figure out what to do next to rescue Elsa, Anna recalls reading in her mother's diary about a wishing star, which she assumes is used to grant a wish. She remembers the journal stated her parents tracked the item to a man, a pirate by the name of Blackbeard.

Anna and Kristoff bargain with Blackbeard for the wishing star, hoping to find Elsa. Unfortunately, they realize it's a trap as Hans and his brothers surround them. Blackbeard tells her about his past encounter with her parents, who sought the wishing star, but they could not use it since the item needs someone with a pure heart. Hans then takes the couple to a spot out at sea called Poseidon's Boneyard, the same spot where Anna and Elsa's parent's ship went down, hoping to dump the couple to the bottom of the sea. The trunk is then shut and thrown into the sea, which sinks and fills with water. Kristoff managed to free himself and Anna from the binds. Believing they will die, Anna begins reciting her marriage vows to Kristoff, though he insists they won't be married until they are out of danger.

Anna and Elsa reunite.
They proclaim their love for each other as they're about meet their watery fate, but fortunately, due to the power of Elsa's belief in finding her sister and her possession of the wishing star, Anna's necklace for her and Kristoff's wedding, the trunk is transported to the shores of Storybrooke where the siblings reunite, along with their mother's message in a bottle. Anna is led to the diner so the fairies can make a spell with her hair to counter Ingrid's imminent curse, since she'd been affected before and can't be again. However, they find the fairies gone, courtesy of Killian under the control of Mr. Gold, the town's counterpart of Rumplestiltskin. At the sheriff station, Anna reunites with David and meet his family: his wife Mary Margaret, their baby son Neal, and their daughter Emma, whom she and Kristoff had just recently met when they arrived. With the spell just moments away, Elsa helps Kristoff handcuff himself to a desk before it approaches, while she, Anna and Emma brace for impact. Though the three are immune to the spell's effects, Anna could only helplessly watch as Kristoff, trying to resist, is slowly affected.

With the town now affected, Mary Margaret and David argue with each other from their separate cell, and Kristoff begins to express his relief that Anna keeps postponing their wedding. After fruitlessly trying to persuade Kristoff that Ingrid's spell causes him to say all the hurtful words about her, Anna left him to discuss with Emma and Elsa about the situation. When Emma recalls her promise to give the people of Storybrooke their happy ending, Anna remembers Ingrid's curse being similar to a myth called The Trolden Glass, in which she reveals that the curse can be broken by killing the person who had cast the spell, the king; meaning they have to do the same with Ingrid. Before she and Elsa left to face Ingrid, with no other option since they can't reason with her, Emma leaves Anna to look after Neal.

As the town is thrown into utter chaos, Anna tried to dissolve Mary Margaret and David's quarrel by bringing up their early lives and how they met in the Enchanted Forest as Snow White and Prince Charming, but to no avail. Later, Regina, affected by the spell and in her attire as the Evil Queen, arrive at the sheriff's station to look for Emma, but found Anna, Kristoff, Mary Margaret, and David locked up in their cells. Despite Anna's attempt to calm her down, Regina teleported her and Kristoff to the beach they arrived from. After a frustrated Kristoff attempt to swim back to Arendelle after giving up on the current event that transpires, Anna knocked him out with a bottle that carries her mother's message. Anna discovers its content and decides to bring it to Elsa and Emma, who are confronting Ingrid in her lair.

After arriving, Anna reveals to Elsa their mother's last words in the letter and read the whole thing out loud. It's revealed that, before they died, their parents were wrong to keep the girls apart, as well as hiding Elsa and her abilities, along with Ingrid and Helga's existence, from Arendelle. The letter also shows their mother's instructions on how to restore the memories of the people of Arendelle with a memory stone of her elder sisters and how they should free Ingrid, and they should tell their aunt that she loved her and that she regretted deeply what she had done. After reading the letter and seeing the good memories of her and her sisters, Ingrid realized that Anna is right and begins to regret her action. Realizing her wrongs, Ingrid undoes her curse by sacrificing her own life. Before she dies, Ingrid returns Elsa and Emma's missing memories and Storybrooke returns to normal. With Ingrid's redemption now complete, Anna and Elsa now seek to honor their mother's last wish to return to Arendelle to let its people know of Ingrid and Helga.

Anna, during the finale moments before her wedding.
Following the end of Ingrid's curse, Hook, seemingly with Mr. Gold's help, informs the group that he discovers a door to Arendelle hidden in an abandoned mansion. After they found the door that will take them back to Arendelle and confront Hans, they thank Mary Margaret, David, and especially Emma for their good deeds, of which Anna thanks them for looking after her sister. After Elsa and Kristoff walk into the portal, Anna starts to follow but stops to ask the three that she wanted to thank, Hook and Gold, until she curiously asks about Mr. Gold's identity when he was still living in the Enchanted Forest. She guesses, incorrectly, that he was a "fairy godfather", although David reveals that Mr. Gold was actually Rumplestiltskin. To this, Anna reveals Rumplestiltskin lied about not knowing her or Elsa and tells them that she knows of him from their past encounter, causing Emma to suspect Mr. Gold has not changed and has ulterior motives.

At an unknown amount of time later, Arendelle has been reclaimed by the two sisters, and Hans is dethroned; Anna even got her hand bruised from punching Hans in the face. While in the castle's east wing preparing for her wedding with Kristoff, Anna discovers a portrait of Ingrid, Helga, and Gerda, which she places in the great hall. Before the wedding starts, Elsa, struck by Anna's past decision to postpone the wedding to go to the Enchanted Forest, asks her why she chose to do so. Anna cheerfully reasons that she couldn't be happy if her big sister wasn't as well. With the wedding now in full swing, Elsa helps Anna walk down the aisle.

Printed media
Anna & Elsa: Sisterhood is the Strongest Magic
This series of stories follows the adventures of Anna and Elsa after the events of the film. Most of the tales focus on the sisters rebuilding the bond they've once shared, including Memory and Magic, where an eager young troll claims to have the power to restore the memories of Anna that Pabbie erased after the childhood incident. However, a reluctant Elsa doesn't take kindly to the idea.

In The Secret Admirer, Anna reveals herself to be an aspiring matchmaker and leaps at the opportunity to pair Elsa off with a love interest after the latter received gifts from an anonymous admirer.

Anna Takes Charge looks into Anna's capabilities as sovereign of Arendelle, as she is left to rule the kingdom while Elsa is away for some time. Here she is portrayed as an “outside the box” thinker. Having the people take the day off from planning a huge event which allows them to feel refreshed and work twice as hard the next day. A strategy that Elsa (who had previously had everyone constantly working to meet the deadline) complimented.

Conceal, Don't Feel
In the Twisted Tales story Conceal, Don't Feel, in which Elsa tries to stop Grand Pabbie from erasing Anna's memory of her sister's magic ends up cursing herself and Anna. She could not be in close proximity with Elsa otherwise she would freeze to death. Anna is then taken to be raised by another family in a village called Harmon with no recollection of her royal bloodline in Arendelle. Her mother would visit Anna every other month, posing as a seamstress named "Freya" and Tomally's best friend. In the years that followed, Anna constantly felt drawn to Arendelle and planned to move there someday to open her own bakery. At fifteen, Anna's snowman cookies were famous in the village.

In the meantime, Elsa, through different circumstances, accidentally freezes the kingdom. Anna feels obligated to find out what happened and recruits Kristoff and Sven for help. Once down in Arendelle, Anna hears the story from the Duke of Weselton and Lord Peterssen. When she sneaks into the castle, her memory starts to return. Upon finding Olaf in the halls, they follow Olaf's direction up to the North Mountain to find Elsa.

While halfway up the mountain, after escaping the pack of wolves, Anna, Kristoff, Olaf and Sven run into Hans, a prince from the Southern Isles who is on his way to find Elsa himself. Kristoff and Sven leave the group when Anna and Olaf allow the prince to join them on their quest. They eventually find a cabin inhabited by a family before a royal guard arrives and takes them back to Arendelle. Hans then explains she is the lost princess of the kingdom and wishes to be by her side. However, Anna finds him increasingly untrustworthy and runs down to the dungeon to find her sister. The close proximity causes Anna to freeze. But even with the curse's enactment, the snowstorm becoming increasingly dangerous and Hans's ruthless pursuit, Anna braves through the danger. She recovers all of her childhood memories moments upon seeing Hans readying to strike her sister with his sword. She shields Elsa with her body, but the close proximity causes the curse to take full effect, turning her into an ice statue. However, by recovering her memory, the curse is lifted and Anna is ultimately thawed. After Elsa unfreezes the kingdom, Anna returns to the village to talk with her adoptive parents and then returns to her childhood home, where she starts a new future with her sister, as well as a romantic relationship with Kristoff.

Tales Of Courage and Kindness: Cloudberries for a Queen shows Anna's first cloudberry festival as Queen of Arendelle. She becomes distraught when she realizes that the people are treating her different now that she is their queen. Doing things for her instead of asking her for help or doing things with her like they did before (similar to Elsa's predicament in All Hail the Queen) and seeks to close the growing divide between her and the people.

Other stories
The novel A Frozen Heart delves into the internal thoughts of both Anna and Hans, during the course of the original film, specifically pertaining to their overall relationship, in addition to their backstories and motivations.

A Year with Elsa & Anna (and Olaf, too!) features a flyer released during Anna's birth; the inscription reveals that to commemorate Anna's birth, Agnarr and Iduna held a kingdom gathering in the castle courtyard, where they presented a days-old Anna for the first time to the public from the castle balcony.

Forest of Shadows takes place three years after the first movie and three months before Frozen II. It highlights certain aspects about Anna and Elsa. Elsa prepares to leave Arendelle to go on a grand tour of other countries and decides to leave Anna to look after Arendelle, though she takes it as her sister not wanting her. When a plague hits Arendelle, Anna attempts to price her worth to Elsa by fixing it after discovering a secret room in the castle with books on magic, but accidentally releases a Nattmara (a Scandinavian spirit in the form of a white wolf that feeds on nightmares) on Arendelle. The Nattmara goes on a rampage through Arendelle, putting everyone in a sleep-like state and continuing to grow. After Anna realizes that the Nattmara is a manifestation of Elsa's fear of not being a good queen, she reassures her sister, helping Elsa overcome her fear and causing the Nattmara to shrink before disappearing completely. Following this, Elsa cancels the tour, deciding that she and Anna need to stay to rule Arendelle together. The book also foreshadows events from the sequel, such as a dream Anna has of the earth giants destroying the dam, and the epilogue contains Anna's thoughts during “Into the Unknown”.

She, at one point, is the head of preparations for the Snowman Festival and later travels to the Ice Palace to find blue crocuses for Elsa.

Kingdom Hearts series
In Kingdom Hearts Union χ, Anna appears as a combat Prime power medal used by the game's avatars along with her sister Elsa. Her power from the medals was channeled by the Book of Prophecies.

In Kingdom Hearts III, Anna appears in her homeworld of "Arendelle". Her role is largely the same as it was in the film, but with her brief interactions with Sora, Donald, and Goofy during her search for Elsa. In their pursuit of seven pure hearts, Anna becomes one of the unknowing targets of Organization XIII.

Anna is first seen with Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf as they make their way up the North Mountain to Elsa's palace when they hear Sora's excited reaction to seeing Olaf, causing them to turn around and formally meet Sora, Donald, and Goofy, with Anna asking Olaf if he knows them, but Olaf says he doesn't recognize them. When Sora mentions having just seen and met Elsa a short while ago, Anna has Kristoff take Sven and Olaf away so she can explain to Sora about her past with her big sister and Elsa's ice powers in private. After Sora relates Anna's plight to his own past regarding Riku when he stayed behind with King Mickey Mouse to ensure the locking of Kingdom Hearts after defeating Ansem, Seeker of Darkness, Sora helps Anna and Kristoff with finding Olaf's parts as they had been scattered again. After reassembling Olaf, Heartless show up prompting Sora, Donald, and Goofy to face them while Anna and the others proceed to find Elsa. They then arrive to Elsa's castle, but Sora remained outside with Donald, Goofy, and Sven while Anna went in with Olaf and Kristoff to speak with her big sister. However, in her panic and fear regarding casting Arendelle into an eternal winter with her powers, Elsa lashes out and hits Anna in her heart with them, though neither sister realizes this at first, while Sora clutches his own chest in pain when he realizes something bad has happened to Anna.

Elsa then conjures Marshmallow to get rid of Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf, forcing Sora, Donald, and Goofy to distract him to give Anna and the others time to escape. Later on, Anna's curse has worsened to the point that she can barely walk across the frozen fjord as she struggles to find Kristoff in the hopes he can save her by breaking the curse with an "act of true love". Though she soon spots him and tries to struggle towards him, she hears a sword being drawn and spots Prince Hans about to execute Elsa, who is unaware as she lies on the ice, caught in her grief to not see the prince about to kill her. Sacrificing her chance of saving herself, Anna rushes to her sister's aid and places herself between Hans and Elsa, just as her curse reaches its zenith, turning her into a solid ice statue, shattering Hans' sword and knocking him out cold. However, the darkness in Hans' heart results in a large, wolf-like Heartless named Sköll being created from it, consuming Hans in the process, which Sora is forced to take down with support from Marshmallow, whom he convinced to help them due to Marshmallow's loyalty to protecting Elsa from harm.

After the Heartless is slain, Sora sees Elsa weeping over Anna's frozen body, but Anna's sacrifice to save her sister constituted an "act of true love", thawing her heart and restoring her to flesh and blood. Before Sora can celebrate with the sisters, he is intercepted by Larxene, who is surprised that Anna's love for Elsa filled both of their hearts with light. She then warns Sora that if he doesn't find his seven Guardians of Light soon, the True Organization XIII would go after Anna and Elsa for their pure hearts, as Master Xehanort already has his thirteenth piece of darkness. Despite Sora's worry about Larxene's fateful warning, he is assured that Anna and Elsa can handle it due to their strong love for each other. Elsa then realizes that love is the key to controlling her powers, and is able to end Arendelle's winter. Anna celebrates the return of summer to Arendelle with her sister, Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven, alongside Sora, Donald, and Goofy, before the trio set off on their next adventure.

In the game's credits, Anna and Kristoff are sledding down the mountain before Elsa provides them an ice ramp to land safely. Anna joins Elsa afterwards as Marshmallow arrives with Olaf having fallen to pieces again, but Olaf soon puts himself back together as Marshmallow smiles, while Anna and Elsa look on in amusement.

Musical
Patti Murin as Anna in the Frozen musical.
For the stage adaptation of Frozen, the role of the plucky, free-spirited Princess Anna was originated by actress Patti Murin, who related to Anna back when Frozen first hit theaters. Anna's character - and more specifically, her struggles are explored further in the musical, primarily through song.

Her role in the story is relatively the same, with a few differences littered throughout, including meeting Kristoff on Coronation Day and donning an ice harvester outfit given to her by Kristoff before purchasing her winter gear from Oaken. More significant is when Anna confronts Elsa in the latter's ice palace. Anna learns that the white streak in her hair is from a nearly fatal accident caused by Elsa rather than something she was born with.

Anna is given several new songs, most of which are duets. The first is "A Little Bit of You", sung by herself and Elsa as children when they create Olaf. Another is "What Do You Know About Love?", a confrontational, and later romantic duet in which she and Kristoff question their differing views on love. Anna's first and only solo is "True Love", performed after Hans leaves her to die alone. The song is the dramatic, melancholy climax of Anna's emotional arc, where she reevaluates her tragic life while simultaneously accepting her oncoming death.

Disney Princess
Anna and Elsa on the cover of a French Disney Princess magazine.
Anna and Elsa were originally planned to join the Disney Princess franchise as the twelfth and thirteenth Princesses respectfully. The two were even given two-dimensional art, similar to those of Rapunzel and Merida. However, with the financial and critical success of their movie, the two are currently the stars of the Frozen franchise, rendering it unnecessary to include the two in another major franchise.

Despite this, the two have been commonly featured alongside members of the franchise in merchandise and media. They were referenced in the show Sofia the First. In "The Secret Library", a cold wind and ice droplets are shown in the secret tunnel, alongside other references to all the other Disney Princesses. Later, in "The Secret Library: Olaf and the Tale of Miss Nettle", Olaf is summoned by the Amulet of Avalor, due to the powers of Miss Nettle. It is implied by Olaf, however, that without Miss Nettle's intervention, Anna would have been summoned, as aside only Disney Princesses have been summoned by the amulet.

The two were also included in the updated version of "The Glow", a Disney Princess song.

Inside of Shanghai Disneyland's Enchanted Storybook Castle, wall carvings of the official Disney Princesses are prominently displayed; Anna and Elsa are featured among them.

Inside the book Going to Disneyland: A Guide for Kids and Kids at Heart is a page dedicated to the Disney Princesses, which features Anna as the twelfth member.

Despite not being official members, Elsa and Anna were added into the Ultimate Princess Celebration, due to the event being a unification of both the Disney Princess and Frozen franchises. In the celebration, they're presented as Frozen Queens.

Trivia
At one point, Anna was going to be named Greta, loosely after Gerda, the original heroine of The Snow Queen.
According to Jennifer Lee, Anna was born on the Summer Solstice, and is 18 during Frozen, while the events of Frozen Fever also confirm her birthday taking place roughly a year after the film, making her 19 years old by that time. Her birthday is not celebrated on the Summer Solstice every year, necessarily, as that date differs. But she was born on the day that the Summer Solstice happened for that specific year (e.g. 1821).
Anna's name means "gracious" or "full of grace". Ironically, Anna is more bubbly and daring than graceful.
Anna's name is pronounced "AH-na" in Norwegian, as opposed to the usual English pronunciation "AN-ah".
She is shown to be ticklish at the beginning of her film as a child, as shown when she and Elsa slide down the snow, which Anna giggles yelling "Tickle bumps!"
Anna is mostly seen wearing green and magenta, while Elsa wears blue. Green and magenta represent spring and summer as well as her cheerful and optimistic personality. Similarly enough, Elliott from Pete's Dragon sports the same color palette of green and pink, which are also nature colors and represent his own personality (green=his loyalty and pink=his kindness and love).
Anna sings the most out of all the characters of Frozen.
The two parts of Anna's body that Elsa accidentally hurt with her ice powers, her head and her heart, mirror the two parts of Kai's body that were hit by the broken shards of the Devil's mirror in the original Snow Queen fairy tale: the eye, distorting the way he sees things, and the heart, making him resentful to others. Ironically, Elsa takes on Kai's role in the film.
Although Elsa is based on Kai, Anna receives ice skates from Elsa, mirroring how Kai also received ice skates from the Snow Queen.
When in warm weather, Anna wears outfits which look similar to her winter outfit, but with green coloring.
Anna's winter outfit shares uncanny similarities with Elsa's coronation gown, perhaps symbolically marking how she has gained maturity:
Detachable magenta cape.
Adorned bodice with a V-shaped waistline (black on Anna, and teal on Elsa).
Bluish gloves/mittens (that they eventually took off).
Tight fitting sleeves (black on Elsa, and light blue on Anna).
In addition, by the end of Frozen II, Anna's coronation gown also shares similar black and dark green colors (with slight traces of purple), long, tight-fitting sleeves and long green skirt like Elsa's, hence symbolically marking how she has matured by the events of the sequel.

According to Frozen: The Essential Guide, one of Anna's favorite desserts is krumkake (not to be confused with Streuselkuchen, a dessert of German origin, which is referred to in English-speaking countries as crumb cake) - a thin waffle-like cookie shaped like an ice-cream cone and stuffed with sweet fillings.
In Sofia the First, Anna is mentioned by Olaf in the episode "The Secret Library: Olaf and the Tale of Miss Nettle".
In Zootopia, a little elephant girl wearing an outfit resembling Anna's trademark winter outfit can be seen wandering around in Tundratown.
During renovations of the Walt Disney Animation Studios building, beginning in 2014, Anna was one of the character silhouettes featured on the wall mural.
While it has gone unnoticed by many, Anna has performed feats of incredible strength not typically associated with a woman of her build. Although some may argue that these were kickstarted by adrenaline, examples are:
Flinging a stone bust across a ballroom.
Throwing climbing equipment at Kristoff with enough force to inflict pain with no effort.
Sending a wolf flying off a sleigh with a lute.
Pulling Kristoff up a cliff with a little help from Sven.
Kicking Olaf's head high into the air.
Knocking Marshmallow out with a tree.
Punching Hans in the face with enough force to throw him overboard.
Spraining the wrist of a dignitary when she was a little girl.

Given Anna's hyperactivity, impulsivity, and short attention span, she may have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. She gets easily excited, can sometimes act before she thinks, and her short attention span shows when she says, "Wait, what?" (both in the first movie as an adult and in the sequel as a child).
According to the deleted song "Life's Too Short", Anna was originally intended to marry Hans without Elsa's permission.
When Pabbie alters Anna's memories so she doesn't remember Elsa's powers, if you look closely as he puts the altered memories in her head, her expression changes to a smile.
This is further enforced in the sequel when Anna looked confused when Olaf mentions that Anna was born powerless while introducing himself and his friends to both groups of Arendellian soldiers and Northuldrans during the standoff.
It is also heavily hinted Elsa did not tell her about Pabbie altering her memories, though it is unknown if she forgot to tell her or didn't want to.
However, a few books, including A Frozen Heart and Anna and Elsa: Memories and Magic have Elsa reveal the events that led to their separation when they were children even though Anna still doesn't specifically remember them.

In Forest of Shadows, it is revealed that Anna has a fear that her loved ones may not actually want her around, which was influenced by her childhood and Hans. Although this is resolved at the end of the book, it is prominent in the sequel, with her assuming Kristoff is trying to reject her during his many awkward proposal attempts.
In the same book, it is also revealed that, in her frozen state, Anna was still alive and completely conscious the entire time and has nightmares about it.
However, in A Frozen Heart, Anna describes turning to ice as seeing white and blue then nothing before thawing.
Forest of Shadows and A Frozen Heart also have different versions of Anna waking up after her accident.

According to Elsa, and confirmed by Jennifer Lee, Anna and Elsa both serve as the fifth spirit because "a bridge has two sides". While Elsa can be regarded as the "official" fifth spirit, it is her close bond to Anna that unites the Enchanted Forest and Arendelle, specifically with Anna becoming Queen and Elsa staying as the forest's guardian. This is also supported by the fact that Elsa and Anna were both required to lift the curse: Elsa by discovering the truth and Anna by getting the Earth Giants to destroy the dam.
Ironically, however, it was Anna who broke the curse over the forest while it was Elsa who saved Arendelle from the resulting flood.

In a deleted scene in Frozen II, Elsa reveals to Anna a memory from the water that their parents had planned to tell her the truth about Elsa's magic upon returning from their voyage, the one in which they died.
In the "Five-Minute Sleepy Time Stories" segment "Frozen II: Family Game Night" which takes place before the sequel, chess is Anna's favorite game which she is better than both Kristoff and Elsa at. But she tends to get overenthusiastic about playing to the point of critiquing other players moves and taking over both sides.
Historically chess has been considered a game of royals as it teaches strategy. The fact that Anna is better at the game than Elsa hints her future as Arendelle's true queen.

One of Anna's underlying insecurities was being the "spare" princess, unimportant and not having a true purpose compared to Elsa, who is the heir and later queen; hence why she becomes more secure and fulfilled after Elsa passes the title of queen onto her at the end of the sequel.
When Anna becomes Queen of Arendelle, she has the same hairstyle Elsa had on her coronation day. Their mother also had the same hairstyle when she was queen. Her dress also emphasizes the Arendelle official crest, while both her mother and sister only wore regular dresses.
Unlike her mother and sister, who wore simple tiaras during their reigns, Anna's is very extravagant and contains Arendelle royal symbols, indicating her true role as queen of Arendelle.

On Anna's winter dress, there is a clasp that looks similar to a clasp her mother wore on her dress. It's unknown if this is the same or a replica.
Despite Anna having a horse, Kjekk barely appears in the Frozen storyline, contrasting to Elsa's animal companions that play major roles in the story (Bruni and the Nokk).
