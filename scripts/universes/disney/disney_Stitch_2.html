<html><p>Stitch is also a meetable character at PCH Grill located in Paradise Pier Hotel. He only appears during the Mickey and Friends character breakfast with Lilo and lots of other characters.

He is always seen in Tomorrowland at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland, Shanghai Disneyland, Arabian Coast at Tokyo DisneySea, and sometimes seen at Disneyland, Disney's California Adventure, Disney's Hollywood Studios, Disneyland Paris, and Walt Disney Studios Park for meet-and-greet sessions.

Disneyland
In Mickey and the Magical Map, Stitch can be seen towards the end, when Mickey chases the ink spot into the Hawaiian painting. Stitch is seen on the screen, before ducking down and coming onstage from the side of the screen. He dances with a group of cast members to the song of "Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride".

In World of Color at Disney California Adventure, Stitch can be seen during the "Transformation" sequence at the end of the show. In World of Color: Season of Light, Stitch and his family are featured celebrating the holidays in their own segment.

In It's a Small World, Stitch can be seen with Lilo on a surfboard in the Hawaiian area.

Walt Disney World
Stitch was the main character of Stitch's Great Escape!, where he had a chance to interact with the live audience. This attraction later became a meet-and-greet area where guests can have photos with him until the signage was dropped. It is currently unknown where he will meet in Tomorrowland.

He also appeared during 'Ohana breakfast times with Lilo, Mickey, and Pluto in Disney's Polynesian Village Resort until 2020 when it was closed to be Moana-themed for the summer of 2021. So it is unknown if he will return for character dining appearances.

Stitch is the star of Stitch's Supersonic Celebration, initially on a video screen and then in costumed form. The Stitch character on the video screen could interact with guests, using the same technology as in Turtle Talk with Crush.

Stitch is one of the characters that appears on the riverboat in the finale of the WDW version of Fantasmic! beginning in mid-2002. He used to be in the Disneyland version but was since omitted.

In Star Tours: The Adventures Continue, Stitch also made a cameo inside a piece of luggage in the baggage check section of the ride, Star Tours: The Adventures Continue. G2-9T, when noticing Stitch inside, removed the luggage and quarantined it, due to animals not being allowed on the flights. He was eventually replaced with Figment.

In A Totally Tomorrowland Christmas, Stitch is one of the special "guest characters" alongside Buzz Lightyear and Mike Wazowski. Unlike the others (until towards the end), Stitch does not appear onstage. He broadcasts himself from a television screen. The host checks back in with him between musical numbers, given the important job of tracking down Santa to make sure he comes for the big finale. As Stitch learns more about Santa from the guests, Stitch mistakes Santa for a "spying snitch who breaks into house" and almost uses his ship's lasers to shoot down Santa and his sleigh. Luckily, he's stopped in time and he now learns the real meaning of Christmas. However, Stitch loses track of Santa afterwards and decides to appear onstage dressed as Santa for the big finale.

In March 2016, he and the Genie are replaced by Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde from Zootopia in the Magic Kingdom parade, Move It! Shake It! Dance and Play It! Street Party. He also appeared in Town Square near the flagpole replacing Marie for more meet-and-greet sessions, but was moved back to Tomorrowland when Stitch's Great Escape was not in use. There, he currently meets on the Tomorrowland stage along with Buzz.

Tokyo Disney Resort
Stitch in his incarnation of The Enchanted Tiki Room.
In Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!, an animatronic Stitch was added in the attraction since 2008. Throughout the show, the Birds of Paradise discover a writing believed to be done by "Big Kahuna" who is thought to be a tiki god and anyone who angers him would put the Tiki Room in trouble. During the musical number "Hawaiian War Chant", Stitch disrupts the song by popping out of the flowerbeds where the orchids are singing (though his full body is not physically seen until the end of the show). During the Showgirl Birds' act, the Birds of Paradise discover the Showgirl Birds wearing Stitch ears in which they explain that a strange creature (referring to Stitch) put blue ears on them as they plan on not finishing the song until Stitch is gone. Waha Nui, one of the Birds of Paradise, gets upset to tell the prankster ruining the show to show up, but Stitch gets insulted when he hears Waha Nui calling him a prankster. When Stitch rises from the fountain, the Birds of Paradise think he is Big Kahuna, but Stitch himself declares he is not. The Birds of Paradise then scold Stitch for disrupting the show in which Stitch explains that he wants to perform in the Tiki Room.

The Birds of Paradise let Stitch perform in the show, on the condition that he not interfere with the show anymore. Stitch agrees, asking the Birds of Paradise and the audience if they want to join his ohana. Stitch and the Birds of Paradise then close the show with a reprise of "Aloha, E komo Mai". Stitch declares, "Everyone...Ê»ohana!" and the show ends with him spitting out of the fountain.

In the defunct Tokyo DisneySea version of Fantasmic!, Stitch starred in his own segment, conducting the water and lights to an instrumental rock version of "Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride" while Angel drives around in a speedboat with a plasma pistol.

In the Polynesian Terrace Restaurant, Lilo's Luau & Fun ran from 2005 to 2020. In it, Lilo & Stitch, as well as Mickey, Minnie, Chip & Dale came on stage and danced with some hula dancers and a ukulele player to the music from Lilo & Stitch.

He also appeared in the now-defunct attaction Mickey Mouse Revue in 2007 during the Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo segment where he was holding a can with yellow paint and a paint brush and he was with Cinderella, then when the Fairy Godmother used her magic for Cinderella's dress, he disappeared and his remaining was the can with yellow paint.

Hong Kong Disneyland
At Hong Kong Disneyland, Stitch used to show up for meet-and-greet sessions in Tomorrowland and Fantasy Gardens, and sometimes appears in Disney's Hollywood Hotel. He also appears in It's a Small World with Lilo and the Flights of Fantasy Parade and appeared in the defunct version of The Golden Mickeys.

Recently, he greets guests most often (especially alongside Lilo) in the Karibuni Marketplace in Adventureland.

Shanghai Disneyland
Stitch met in Tomorrowland and appeared in the caboose in Mickey's Storybook Express until 2020. He also appears in the second segment of Summer Blast in front of Enchanted Storybook Castle.

Disney Cruise Line
Stitch also greets guests on the Disney Cruise Line ships. On board the Disney Fantasy, Stitch interacts with guests boarding the ship in CGI through a screen much like his attraction Stitch Live! (or Stitch Encounter).

He is also present on the Disney Fantasy cruise ship with Lilo in the show Disney's Wishes.

Stitch Encounter
Found in Walt Disney Studios Park (known as Stitch Live!), and Tomorrowland at Tokyo Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland, guests are seated in a room that is something like a theater, and Stitch interacts with the audience. Guests would also need to help Stitch get to his space cruiser before Captain Gantu captures him.

It ran at Hong Kong Disneyland from July 2006 to May 2, 2016.

Disneyland Paris
Stitch also appeared in Stitch's Hawaiian Paradise Party in Disneyland Paris on June 9, 2011 and Merry Stitchmas in 2017.

Trivia
Stitch and Scrump celebrating Stitch Day by Dean DeBlois.
On June 26, 2015, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that it is unconstitutional for any of the states in America to ban gay marriage, as all U.S. citizens have the fundamental right to marry as stated by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Because of the month and day this ruling was made (6/26), many fans began associating with Stitch to the date of the decision, making him its unofficial mascot.
In response to this, Dean DeBlois, a former Disney story supervisor at Walt Disney Feature Animation and co-director/co-writer of Lilo & Stitch who is gay himself, drew an image of Stitch and Scrump celebrating the court's decision. The sketch showed Stitch holding a rainbow flag, which represents gay pride, and Scrump holding a blue flag with a yellow equality sign, representing the logo of the Human Rights Campaign.

Despite not appearing in the show itself (as the show ran for about one year before the movie came out), Stitch was featured with Lilo in some online games for the television series House of Mouse.
In a deleted scene of the original film, Stitch was responsible for the death of Pudge the fish. This incident made him learn about the consequences of his evil actions and gain a better understanding of mortality. It was cut out because Disney figured that it would be too morbid for a protagonist to kill someone and would also set a bad example for children. Moreover, Stitch is more interested in vandalism than violence.
Also, the original version of the scene where Jumba attacks Stitch which results in the Pelekai residence accidentally being burned down was actually going to be much more violent, with scenes such as Stitch using a chainsaw to attack Jumba, as well as setting the house on fire by biting apart a gas pipe and tricking Jumba into shooting it with his blaster. The final version of the same scene has all of the violence removed and in favor of more slapstick (Jumba knocking the ceiling down with dishes instead of laser blasts, Jumba's "shuriken" being made of hairbrushes and a tube of toothpaste instead of knives and a pizza cutter, the entire chainsaw scene shortened), having more comedic scenes added in (exploding Scrump, Stitch catching Jumba's laser, Stitch yelling, "Blue Punch Buggy! No punch back!" when hitting Jumba with Nani's VW, the Elvis Presley song "Hound Dog" playing in the background), and the house being destroyed by having Stitch stop up Jumba's blaster with a carrot and then having them both play "hot potato" with it until the blaster overloads and explodes.
A similar treatment was done to the climax, where Jumba, Pleakley, Stitch, and Nani fly through the mountains to pursue Gantu after he accidentally captures Lilo following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

Stitch is considered to be one of the first successful prototypes for Jumba's "ultimate monster" experiment, though he is technically a failure because he wanted to belong and find a family. Other notable attempts for this prototype are 000, 262, 600, and 625, and each failed for its own reason: 000 is uncontrollable, 262 is good, 600 is clumsy, and 625 is lazy. 627 and Leroy are additional attempts Jumba made after Stitch, but both of them also failed: 627 is weak to laughter while Leroy is weak to a song. However, Leroy can also be considered a success, since Jumba deliberately programmed the weakness into him.
Stitch appears, along with several other Lilo & Stitch characters, in a parody of the Disney Channel Original Movie High School Musical, which was broadcast as part of the High School Musical: Around the World one-year anniversary special.
In said parody, when Stitch and the other experiments are looking up at the ceiling, Stitch is colored red and 627 is colored blue. It is unknown how this happened, though it could be a coloring error.

Stitch has a tendency to refer to himself in the third person. He developed this habit probably because of his broken English or he had gotten it from Jumba, who also refers to himself in the third person.
In Lilo & Stitch, the only two times he did this was after he was apprehended by the Grand Councilwoman, asking her if he has to go into her ship, and if he can say goodbye to Lilo and Nani.
In Stitch Has a Glitch, he is shown to do this less often.
In the English dub of the Stitch! anime, he does it even less often than before, but over the course of the series, he seems to have grown out of this habit: he talks in complete sentences, his English has improved, and he has more dialogue.
This may actually imply that his command of Japanese is better than his English; since he is on an island prefecture of Japan, it is reasonable that he is speaking the local language, and thus the American-dubbed version is actually a case of "audience filter". On the other hand, since the anime takes place years after Leroy & Stitch, Stitch may have spent enough time on Hawaii before leaving to actually get a decent grasp on English. It should also be noted that English is heavily-taught as a second language in Japan.
However, in Stitch & Ai, he mainly speaks his original dialect (Tantalog).
Stitch's weak grasp of English throughout the franchise (especially in the original 2002â2006 continuity) does not make logical sense, considering his hypercognition, the fact that he shows no apparent signs of struggling in understanding English, the fact that the aliens in the franchise can speak fluent English (including his own creator more or less), and the fact that he spends most of his time with Lilo, who has a very complex vocabulary (especially for someone her age). The indirect explanation that he does not have "advanced language programming" like his predecessor Reuben also does not make sense considering the above, and in fact leaves a plot hole as to why Stitch doesn't have such an ability when his predecessor, who is said to have every power and ability that Stitch has, does.

While Stitch and the other experiments are technically siblings, "cousins" is a Hawaiian term, like "Ê»ohana", for extended family and close friends, although Stitch only uses it in regard to the experiments.
Stitch loves reading his favorite storybook, The Ugly Duckling by Hans Christian Andersen, which he obtained from Lilo at some point.
The plot revolving around the book mirrors Stitch questioning his purpose, as it revolves around his loneliness and desire to find a family, to which he did in the end.
Stitch also developed a fondness for ducks as he showed some ducklings the storybook, as seen in the credits of Lilo & Stitch.

Stitch also developed a fondness for ducks as he showed some ducklings the storybook, as seen in the credits of Lilo & Stitch.
Stitch apparently has a fondness for frogs as seen in Lilo & Stitch, where Stitch saves one from being blasted by a plasma gun of Gantu's ship.
He is also very fond of sea turtles and even sleeps with a stuffed one, as seen in Stitch Has a Glitch.
In the end credits of Lilo & Stitch, Stitch is also seen covering a turtle and its baby with a leaf.

Stitch likes to dress up as Elvis Presley and is very skilled at playing the ukulele.
His favorite foods are coconut cake and coffee, which are the very first Earth-based food and drink he ever ate, as seen in the original film and also mentioned in Stitch! The Movie. However, whenever he drinks coffee, he gains a massive amount of uncontrollable energy. Ironically, in "Slugger", he drank a large bowl of cappuccino, along with Lilo's cappuccino, but didn't go crazy at all.
He has also been shown to eat anything inedible and very rarely doesn't like to eat something. An exception was in "Spooky", when he spit out a lemon, saying, "Ew, organic!", implying he might not like lemons.
However, in "Shortstuff", Stitch, as a giant, drank some lemonade from the cart he accidentally smashed without expressing any disgust, and in "Swapper", he drank a whole bowl of lemonade (albeit modified by Jumba to cause those who drink it to temporarily change colors), again without expressing any disgust, which would contradict this supposed dislike of lemons. It could be that either Stitch doesn't like organically-grown foods (as his heightened senses might have the unintended side effect of him tasting even the tiniest amounts of manure residue), he doesn't like the taste of unsweetened lemons or lemon juice, or him spitting out the organic lemon was nothing more than a simple joke.
In the Stitch! anime, he also loves Yuna's blue crab sushi.

Due to a continuity error, Stitch's ear notches have a tendency to disappear or change position in some works or merchandise.
Following after Stitch! The Movie, Stitch's toes have changed from dark blue to black.
Additionally, following after Stitch Has a Glitch, Stitch's fur color has changed from dark blue to light blue.

Stitch's blood is revealed to be pink when a sample was taken out of his body.
Some fans say Stitchâs appearance is more similar to a koala than a dog.
At the end of the original film, he was seen wearing red trunks & shorts, making him look similar to the koala character Blinky Bill.

When Stitch has a glitch, his eyes glow green.
In the original film, Stitch's eyes were a piercing green as shown after he crashed landed on Earth. In Stitch Has a Glitch, the animation was reused in the beginning.

Usually when Stitch rolls into a ball, he puts his feet into his mouth and covers his face with his butt. In "Dupe" and "Snafu", his ball form resembles Cannonball's ball form in Leroy & Stitch.
Since Lilo's adoption of Stitch was a legal process under State of Hawaii law (complete with legal documentation), it can be said that his legal name is indeed "Stitch" and not "Experiment 626". Disney Infinity seems to reinforce this by describing him as "Dr. Jumba's former Experiment 626" on the description for Stitch in the games' Hall of Heroes.
This may also provide additional context when he interrupts the Grand Councilwoman to clarify his name in the denouement of Lilo & Stitch, as he may also imply that it would no longer be considered proper to refer to him as "Experiment 626" in any further formal or legal matters. Since he is referred to as "Captain Stitch" when he joins the Galactic Armada in Leroy & Stitch, it could also be that the United Galactic Federation does formally acknowledge "Stitch" as his proper legal name; if they didn't, then he would have been "Captain 626" instead.

In the prequel comics and The Origin of Stitch, it is revealed that Stitch's genes contain those of some of the most powerful creatures in the galaxy, as well as some of Jumba's for "brains and good looks". One of the genes was a puppy, explaining Stitch's resemblance to a dog (though Jumba did not know how it got in there).
In each of the franchise's three TV series, Stitch grows into a giant at least once per show via some method.
In the Lilo & Stitch: The Series episode "Shortstuff", Stitch uses Jumba's Protoplasmic Growth Ray to make himself bigger, but the episode's experiment also becomes bigger. Stitch uses his giant size to fight Shortstuff at the carnival, but loses. Stitch would later be returned to his normal size in order to fight back.
In an episode of the Stitch! anime, Shrink zaps Stitch with an energy ray after the latter falls into a swimming pool, causing him to grow into a giant. Due to Retro reverting Stitch to his original destructive programming, Stitch goes on a rampage in this giant form until Yuna reaches out to him and reminds him of his promise. Shrink would be used again to revert Stitch to his original size.
In Stitch & Ai, it is revealed that Stitch has a metamorphosis code programmed in his DNA, which transforms him into a gigantic monster armed with four tentacle-like blasters.
However, a deleted version of the opening of the original film contradicts this. In this opening, the Galactic Council shows video footage of Experiment 626âin his familiar small sizeâcausing chaos and destruction in an alien city, including tipping over a skyscraper by lifting it from its base. The existence of this scene strongly suggests that Chris Sanders, Stitch's creator and original voice actor, never intended or at least considered giving Stitch this metamorphosis ability, thus likely making the monstrous "destruction form" in Stitch & Ai a retcon or a "revision" of the character. (Sanders did not work on either Stitch & Ai or the Stitch! anime series in any capacity; he was only credited in those shows for creating the characters who originated in Lilo & Stitch, including Stitch.)

Stitch appeared on more covers for issues of Disney Adventures than any other character, appearing on the cover of twelve issues.
Toothless, a Night Fury from DreamWorks Animation's How to Train Your Dragon franchise, bears a strong resemblance to Stitch. Even their facial expressions are similar, especially those showing excitement, wariness, and anger. However, their personalities are somewhat different, as Stitch is far more mischievous than Toothless. This is not a coincidence; Chris Sanders was the designer for both characters and co-directed both films with Dean DeBlois. It is also possible that Toothless was inspired by him.
Chris Sanders left Disney to join DreamWorks (Disney's rival animation company) in 2007 due to creative differences over Disney rejecting his original Bolt script and designs. Despite his departure, though, Sanders still continues to voice Stitch in video games like Kingdom Hearts II, Birth by Sleep, Disney Infinity 2.0, and in any other appearances of Stitch.

Stitch (or at least a four-armed blue koala who looks like him) makes a possible cameo appearance in the 2004 Looney Tunes short "Duck Dodgers in Attack of the Drones", seen at the beginning as one of the five aliens in the council.
This is one of the few times that a Disney character appears alongside the Looney Tunes cast.
