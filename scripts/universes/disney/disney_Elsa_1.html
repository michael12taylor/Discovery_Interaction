Elsa the Snow Queen is the deuteragonist of Disney's 2013 animated feature film Frozen and the protagonist of its 2019 sequel. Born with the power of ice and snow, Elsa is the firstborn daughter of King Agnarr and Queen Iduna, the older sister of Queen Anna, and the former queen of Arendelle. Throughout most of her young life, Elsa feared that her powers were monstrous. Therefore, she isolated herself from the world as a means of protecting her family and kingdom. Elsa's anxieties would eventually trigger a curse that plunged Arendelle into an eternal winter. Through Anna's love, however, Elsa was able to control her powers and live peacefully amongst her people with a newfound self-confidence.

Three years into her reign, Elsa is called forth to Ahtohallan to assume her rightful place as the Fifth Spirit of the Enchanted Forest, whose purpose is to bridge the magic of nature and people. She thereby abdicates the throne, allowing Anna to rise as the new queen of Arendelle.

Elsa is loosely based on the titular character of "The Snow Queen", a fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. Though pivotal to its events, the character had little presence in the original story. The Disney adaptation expanded the Snow Queen to serve as a villain initially, but the advent of "Let It Go" inspired the filmmakers to rewrite the character as a tragic heroine.

Development
An early concept of the Snow Queen by Harald Siepermann.
After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1938, Walt Disney sought out new fairytales to serve as the basis for future productions. Marc Davis, one of Disney's key animators, traveled to Scandinavia on Walt's orders to research the region's books and stories. Davis was enraptured by the tales of Hans Christian Andersen, and proposed they be adapted to animated shorts at the studio. Walt Disney's adaptation of The Snow Queen was given a production number in 1939. There were talks regarding a live-action biography on Hans Christian Andersen, which would have featured animated segments based on his works. It is believed by historians that The Snow Queen was intended to be one of the project's animated sequences, but there is no evidence of creative work for the proposed feature.

In Hans Christian Andersen's original story, the Snow Queen abducts a young boy named Kai, who had fallen victim to the machinations of an evil mirror. The Queen promises to break the mirror's spell if Kai can spell “eternity” with pieces of ice in her palace. Kai's disappearance leads his childhood friend, Gerda, to embark on a quest to find him. In the tale, the Snow Queen resides in an ice palace coated in permafrost and guarded by such animals as polar bears and porcupines.

Disney's decades long efforts to adapt The Snow Queen generally shared a common thread of trying to find a way to expand on the role of the title character and make her a more active presence in the story. A common theme in adaptation attempts in the late 1990s and early 2000s was to reconfigure the story into a romantic comedy about the Snow Queen's ice-cold heart-melting as she learns to love. One of these attempts almost went as far as to pair an aged-up Kai with the Snow Queen while vilifying Gerda.

A common consensus was that Disney's iteration of the Snow Queen would be portrayed as a villain. Early concept art and visual development depicted the character—eventually named Elsa—as being a ruthless, bitter, cold-hearted tyrant who had an entire army of giant snowmen as henchmen. Designs for this version of Elsa resembled such figures as actress Bette Midler, and the late singer Amy Winehouse. These designs depicted Elsa with spiky black or dark blue hair (and even blue-gray skin), a more angular body (as opposed to the final, heroic Elsa's curvaceous body) and a constantly malicious smile. Some concept art depicted her with a group of pet ermines who scurried up and down her body and formed themselves into a cloak for her.

Instead of being fearful and insecure about not wanting to reveal her powers, Elsa would have been very hostile and bitter toward others, especially Anna, whom she was incredibly jealous of because of the royal status she held. According to songwriter Kristen Anderson-Lopez, Elsa's original motivation throughout the film was to freeze Anna's heart and take over the kingdom. As stated by producer Peter Del Vecho in a 2017 interview, Elsa was originally unrelated to Anna, and she was originally a scorned woman who was left single by her would-be fiancé at her own wedding day and froze her own heart in order to never love again. She would have been misunderstood as "Arendelle's bane" in the original prophecy and would have redeemed herself at the last minute to save all of Arendelle from an avalanche caused by Prince Hans (the real bane of Arendelle in the prophecy).

Despite these developments, there were still concerns that the Elsa character was cliché and unlikable. According to Del Vecho, there was no emotional connection to Elsa, which ultimately made for a dissatisfying story. Someone on the writing team proposed rewriting Elsa and Anna as siblings. In doing so, the filmmakers found their emotional hook. Del Vecho explained, “Making them related led us to the idea of her living in fear of her powers. What if she's afraid of who she is? And afraid of hurting the ones she loves? Now we had a character in Anna who was all about love and Elsa who was all about fear.”

Elsa became increasingly sympathetic as development continued. Regardless, she was still largely conceived as a villain, albeit three-dimensional. Songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez were penned to write the songs for the film. Among the soundtrack was a “villain song” for Elsa, in which she forgoes her personal connections for the sake of embracing her true-self as the Snow Queen. As the songwriters delved into Elsa’s personal turmoil, they felt an empathy for the character that drove them to compose a song that was tragic, yet empowering. Within a day and a half, the Lopez couple wrote “Let It Go” as Elsa's anthem, and sent the demo to the studio. The song was praised, and inspired co-director and screenwriter Jennifer Lee to rewrite the entire movie with Elsa as a heroine, rather than an antagonist.

Lee would explain that Elsa is largely driven by fear throughout the film. Producers identified the scene in which Elsa sings "Let It Go" as a pivotal point in the character's development, as the scene depicts her choice to "let go" of her fear of using her powers and be herself. Character design supervisor Bill Schwab said, "Before 'Let It Go', Elsa is really buttoned up, her hair is up - everything is perfect. During the song, she gives herself permission to be who she is and everything changes - her hair is wilder, her gown is magical. She's finally free - even if she is all alone." Lead writer Paul Briggs explained that Anna's support is what Elsa needs most when her secret is exposed. "The strength of the family bond is what makes this story so powerful because it's her sibling who's willing to look beyond her powers and stand between her and the world if that's what it takes."

Voice
Actress and singer Megan Mullally was originally cast to voice Elsa, but was replaced by Broadway actress Idina Menzel, best known for performing Elphaba from Wicked when the story changed. Menzel had previously auditioned for a lead role in the 2010 Disney animated feature film, Tangled. She was not cast for the part, but the casting director recorded her singing and later showed the recording to Frozen's film executives. Menzel was surprised when she was subsequently asked to audition, and she received the role after reading the script out loud.

Director Chris Buck believed that Menzel's vocals would help in the portrayal of the character, saying, "Idina has a sense of vulnerability in her voice. She plays a very strong character, but someone who lives in fear - so we needed someone who could portray both sides of the character, and Idina was just amazing."

In an interview with Menzel, she acknowledged the similarities between Elsa and Elphaba. She mentioned they were both very powerful and misunderstood individuals, and she herself could relate to the characters, having hidden her singing talent from her peers at school. "I didn't want to alienate anyone," she explained. "If everyone was singing along in the car to a Madonna song, I didn't join in because when we're younger we're afraid of sticking out or showing off when in fact we should own those things that make us really unique."

Personality
As the queen regnant of the kingdom of Arendelle, Elsa appears calm, reserved, regal and - unlike her sister - graceful and poised. Beneath this cool and collected appearance, however, Elsa is quite turbulent; in truth, the Snow Queen was, for a majority of her young life, troubled by her abilities, a feeling which stems from a traumatic incident as a child. When she was younger, she had cared strongly for Anna and, despite being the more mature and cautious of the two sisters, Elsa was still quite playful and used her magic to have fun and goof off.

However, after witnessing her magic cause her sister harm, Elsa lived in fear and trauma for a great amount of her life as she became too terrified to let her powers overdevelop. She consequently chose isolation from everyone she cared for, including Anna, out of the presumption that her isolation would protect them from her power. This would eventually result in years of loneliness, misery, bitterness, and grief. Regret would gradually take its toll on her when tragedies struck throughout her life, from the accident with her sister to the death of her parents, leaving them both to mourn and grieve alone.

Elsa's damaging experience through the crucial stages from childhood to adulthood caused her personality to shift. She became reclusive, insecure, emotionally unstable, anxious, and depressed. For Elsa, her powers and nature grew more restrained as the years passed, slowly molding her into the cold-hearted queen others saw her to be. However, when given a chance to rest and relent, Elsa's true, warm, kind, fun-loving, and innocently mischievous personality came about - but only briefly and with restriction, as seen on the night of her coronation.

Elsa also has a generous disposition that contributes to her compassion towards her people. Throughout the film's entirety, the Snow Queen's actions are driven by the desire to protect her kingdom, and more intimately, Anna. Unfortunately, that comes with a price, as Elsa's upbringing would lead her to believe that, for the safety of her loved ones and for the sake of remaining true to who she is as a gifted person, she is a living disaster that must be removed from society. Even with Anna's persistence to help end the curse, Elsa's method of solving the problem - enforced isolation - would remain prevalent. Her determination to solve her problems through singularity is Elsa's greatest flaw, driven by her anxiety and traumatic childhood experiences.

Though a benevolent and giving person, Elsa suffers from emotional instability due to years of keeping her emotions bottled up. When her strong emotions are triggered, Elsa often loses control over her emotions which can create dangerous situations for herself and others around her. An example of this is when Anna informed her that she had unknowingly plunged Arendelle into an "eternal winter", she began panicking as she realized she had brought harm upon her kingdom, which made her lose control of both her emotions and powers, resulting in ice bursting from her chest and striking Anna in the heart. But perhaps the prime example of this was when the Duke of Weselton's guards attempted to assassinate her and Elsa realizes she has no choice but to fight back, and, unable to control her fury, goes from self-defense to fighting back more aggressively, nearly pushing a man off the edge of her ice palace and pinning another to the wall with icicles, ready to kill him before Hans intervened and talked her down from committing cold-blooded murder to protect herself.

During "Let It Go", however, Elsa reveals a liberated side to her personality. Without stress, responsibilities, or the fear of hurting others, the queen is strong and unafraid, yet with an air of elegance still surrounding her. Based on this fact, she has confidence in her abilities and accepts them as a part of her, no longer worried or daunted by her restraints. In the segment, which was entirely about letting go of her fear of using her powers and embracing herself, Elsa decides to abandon what she was made to be so that she can be free to be herself. While expressing this, Elsa proves that she is notably creative and strong in geometry (her ice palace is made entirely out of geometric figures) and a daring young woman willing to reject her own fate as Arendelle's queen for the choice of her own personal freedom as well as to protect the people in Arendelle from her powers.

Following her return to power as Arendelle's reigning monarch, Elsa's original personality, long dormant since her childhood, makes a return. With a warm, welcoming aura, Elsa rules her kingdom with a genuine smile and spends most of her spare time using her abilities for the pleasure of herself, her sister, and the entire kingdom. As seen in Frozen Fever, this aspect of Elsa's personality has not only remained, but strengthened, as the short heavily showcased Elsa's lighter side as fun-loving, and extremely devoted to her sister, yet retained her sense of elegance, vibrancy, and compassion. In spite of this, Elsa continues to feel guilt for the past, which manifests itself into a personal mission to ensure that Anna is content at all times; in Frozen Fever, she goes to great lengths to give Anna a memorable birthday and is dedicated to ensuring that even the slightest detail is perfect. During their first holiday season as a united family, Elsa comes to realize that she and Anna have no family traditions to share with one another, for which she openly blames herself. However, she later realizes that her and Anna's childhood memories of creating Olaf are her family's traditions as Anna keeps giving Elsa Christmas gifts based on Olaf which reminds her and Anna on their happy childhood and how much they still love each other.

In the sequel, Elsa seeks the truth about the source of her powers as well as who she really is. She begins to question her place in Arendelle as Ahtohallan calls for her every night until she answers it during "Into the Unknown". Upon entering the Enchanted Forest, Elsa becomes more confident with her abilities and heroic, protecting her family and the Northuldra from the Wind and Fire Spirits. She has since become more heroic, promising the Northuldra that she will do what she can to break the curse and free the forest. This drives her to seek the truth of the past by journeying to Ahtohallan despite the dangers it presented, as well as great strength and determination fighting and taming the Nokk. After witnessing their parents' deaths through a memory stored in ice, Elsa blames herself, and refuses to let Anna follow her into the Dark Sea. She finally finds Ahtohallan and recognizes herself as the Fifth Spirit, recognizing that her powers were indeed a gift and not a curse, no longer feeling restricted in using her powers. Having found her place among the spirits, she passes the position of Queen of Arendelle onto Anna, and stays behind to live with the Northuldra as the forest's protector, finally at peace with herself and with both the freedom she’s always wanted and her bond with her sister stronger than ever.

Physical appearance
At 21 years of age in the original film and 24 in the sequel, Elsa is a beautiful young woman, has a tall and slender build, blue eyes, rosy cheeks, thin pink lips, a small nose, long, platinum-blonde hair, and pale skin with a light dusting of freckles (a trait she shares with her sister Anna, though less prominent). During her coronation, she bore a striking resemblance to her mother, only with platinum-blonde hair, unlike her mother who is a brunette.

Before her coronation, Elsa's casual outfits consisted of a dress with a long-sleeved vest over a blouse and bodice favoring a blue-black color scheme. Ever since the accident with Anna at the age of eight, Elsa has worn white gloves to contain her powers. As she grows older, she starts wearing darker clothes with purple colors thrown in.

For the coronation, Elsa wears a teal dress with a sweetheart bodice with bronze trim, and dark teal, maroon and purple rosemaling on the skirt and bodice, a black, long-sleeved turtleneck blouse with red and teal crystal-shaped prints on it, a long, magenta cape, a small, gold tiara, dark brown flats with gold outlines, and teal tights (which disappear after her transformation) underneath, and her hair woven in a French braided crown twist bun held together with a blue ribbon. She wears long, light turquoise gloves with teal prints that go with her outfit. Her eyelids have a dusting of purple eye shadow, and she wears magenta lipstick.

Following the song "Let It Go", Elsa begins to wear her hair in a loose French braid that's swept over her left shoulder, tied with a hairband with a crystal-like snowflake on it. It is woven with snowflake incrustations, and wisps of her bangs slicked back on top of her head with a smaller piece resting down on her forehead. Her hair appears to be thick, although this may be so because she has much more hair (roughly 400,000 strands) than the average human (100,000 strands). She wears a crystal-blue off-the-shoulder dress made out of ice with a right knee-high slit, a crystallized bodice, and translucent powder blue sleeves. She also wears ice-made kitten heels and a long transparent floor-sweeping cape of sheer ice decorated with large snowflakes attached to the back of her bodice. Elsa still wears the same makeup as at the coronation, however, due to the change in lighting, the magenta lipstick becomes a dark pink, and her lavender eye shadow becomes a shiny purplish-pink.

In Frozen Fever, Elsa wears her hair in her signature French braid (tied with a hairband with a pink flower on it in place of a snowflake) woven with small pink flowers and a larger pink flower on the right side of her head. She wears an emerald green off-the-shoulder dress made out of ice with a right knee-high slit, just like her Snow Queen dress. Unlike her ice dress, her Frozen Fever dress has a sweetheart bodice covered in teal ice crystals that are patterned to resemble leaves and light green translucent short sleeves. Her sleeves and top of her bodice are decorated with pink flowers. She wears dark emerald green ice kitten heels, and a long transparent floor-sweeping dark emerald green cape of sheer ice decorated with flower and leaf designs with pink flowers stuck on is attached to the back of her bodice. Her eye shadow is now a light pink, and she wears dark pink lipstick.

In Olaf's Frozen Adventure, Elsa wears a midnight blue off-the-shoulder sleeved gown - displaying a return to her use of dark colors - that incorporates her signature Snow Queen style. The dress has a velvet texture, though it has a large fur collar with small stones inside and a small V-shaped cut at the center that exposes a purple undershirt. Fitting her regal status, Elsa's outfit features a transparent blue cape, but this one is slightly less transparent than the previous capes. She wears dark blue ice kitten heels, similar to her first Snow Queen outfit. On the chest, cape, and rims of the outfit are diamond-shaped crystals scattered across, with some forming the lower half of her Snowflake emblem on the neckline and a larger pattern on the back of the cape. She wears a small winter berry wreath pin in her hair.

In the sequel, Elsa maintains her hairstyle in her Snow Queen state and wears a magenta-nightgown. She also wears a scarf which was worn by her mother Queen Iduna. During their travel to the Enchanted Forest, she wears a light blue jacket with a pale blue dress adorned with a sky-blue belt as the long sleeves are showing her shoulders, matching pale blue leggings and boots and is set off by a flowing cape split in two in the back. She wears ice blue boots with shimmering snowflake patterns from top to toe. Her dress, which has an illusion neckline is pale blue, the skirt of her dress stops at the shin. When she travels alone to the sea and taming the Nokk, Elsa removes her jacket, belt, boots and the clip from her French braid to make it loose as she tied her hair into a loose ponytail.

When she takes the mantle of the fifth element, Elsa's hair is now loose, and she wears a combination between her second outfit and her dress from her Snow Queen state; she wears a white off-the-shoulder dress with a right knee-high slit, light grayish-blue leggings and white long sleeves which have the symbol of the four elements at the shoulder. Along her chest down to her waist are diamond-shaped ice crystals resembling the elements of fire, water, wind, and earth. Her translucent cape fades to blue at the bottom and is split in two, like fairy wings, draping over her as if to showcase her status as the fifth spirit. The glittery sequins on her sleeves and pantyhose signify that she is the Snow Queen and the forest's protector, and she wears white open-toe ballet flats.

Powers and abilities
Elsa's snow magic.
Elsa possesses the magical ability to conjure and manipulate ice and snow. Elsa can manifest and shape various structures made of ice and snow or cold phenomena with the abilities she was born with, from snow flurries to blizzards. Most of her powers are unleashed via her hands and controlled by her emotions. If she is happy and at peace, she can control them better, but if she is angry, afraid, or stressed, she will lose control and cause great harm to those around her. Near the end of Frozen, she has complete control over her powers.

Elsa was able to turn the entire castle's ballroom into a winter wonderland. She is capable of creating enchanted snowmen (both large and small), ice structures such as her ice palace, deadly blizzards, and more. She can move ice structures at will. It also appears that her control extends to almost all forms of winter weather, as she was able to create a snow cloud for Olaf, and manipulate wind streams to some degree. Interestingly, it would seem that nearly her entire body is capable of conjuring ice and snow, as seen when she flees across the fjord - the water immediately starts to freeze the moment her foot touches it.

Elsa in the process of creating her ice palace.
Her powers are most prominently featured during "Let It Go" in which Elsa frees herself from the fear of using her powers and stress she held and embraces such powers to the fullest of her ability for the first time. In the sequence, she created her ice palace, a stairway for entrance, Olaf, as well as her flowing ice gown. She even points out that her powers provide her immunity from the effects of cold weather.

Despite initially not having any formal training, she is capable of using her magical abilities for battle. When the Duke's thugs attacked her, she was able to hold them both off on her own and eventually manage to gain the upper hand.

It is also interesting that when Elsa is truly frightened or feels threatened, her powers will act on their own accord in order to protect her. When confronted by the Duke of Weselton on the night that her powers were revealed, Elsa made an attempt to avoid conflict, but her powers were unleashed upon the Duke and his men as the feeling of being threatened grew, nearly killing him. When she was attacked by the Duke's men, a bolt was shot at her from a crossbow. Almost instantly, a wall of ice formed as a shield to intercept the bolt before it would otherwise lodge itself in Elsa's head. In Frozen II, this is revealed to be due to her magic coming from the natural elements, her powers being the manifestation of the elemental spirits themselves responding to Elsa's emotions. It also appears that her powers depend on which emotion she feels; if she is in sorrow, all the snow particles in the air stand still as if in a state of suspended animation, while anger creates a similar effect to fear but with an offensive direction instead of chaotic versatility.

Elsa's memory is also a factor: her powers are influenced by the memory of the surrounding environment, and whatever memory is present will influence what results. At Ahtohallan, for example, Elsa created accurate sculptures of the people closest to her throughout her life, all acting out significant events and experiences. This was why she was able to create Olaf, Marshmallow, and the Snowgies. As she was experiencing strong emotions and memories with an emotional tone, her ice magic split off into these external shells created by Elsa, each influenced by a memory of Elsa and represents a certain aspect of Elsa's personality. Even when Olaf succumbed to withering away when robbed of Elsa's magic, Elsa was able to bring back Olaf with his memories intact using memories of the snow he was made from. She can also create detailed sculptures representing events that happened in the past, which allowed her to unlock the truth of the Enchanted Forest.

The only way thought to conceal her powers is initially by wearing gloves on her hands, which appeared to negate her icy touch on other objects. However, this is nothing but a psychological mindset that helps to keep her anxiety and any icy outbursts under control all her life. Because it is her father, one of the few people she trusted, that claims that wearing them will stop her abilities, Elsa believes it to be true, so by wearing gloves, she thinks truly stop her powers, as a result of said belief, they do. This is supported by the fact she is able to freeze through the hand shackles in Arendelle's prison cell in her desperation to get away, proving that covering her hands does not actually stop her power but rather the sheer force of will and belief.

It is shown that if she casts her magic on a living being directly, the victim will not only freeze to death but slowly transform into an ice statue, and the process only hastens if they are in cold conditions. While the curse can be removed if the magic affects the mind, the heart is the most vulnerable, and if this is the case, the victim can only be cured by an "act of true love". While Elsa had thought she cannot undo the frosty effects she creates, it is revealed that she is capable of removing such curses through her love for others, as it is the warmest emotion of all. When the person gets affected by her magic, the said person will also undergo physical changes; first, some of their hair will turn white as snow before it spreads completely; second, the person will start to feel cold, and as it progresses, the person will get colder and soon become weak to walk nevertheless move; and finally, the person will notice ice emerging from their hands, then the person will become enraptured in ice. When the curse is removed, the person's physical attributes will revert back as they were before the curse, as happened with Anna's hair, which returned to its original color (without any white locks), when she accomplished her act of true love towards Elsa, sacrificing her own life for the latter.

The sequel reveals that this curse does not exclude even Elsa: after the horrifying revelation of her grandfather's crime against both Arendelle and the Northuldra, Elsa's inconsolable state of sadness and heartbreak left her vulnerable, allowing Ahtohallan's magic to supersede her own powers and cause her to undergo the same transformation into pure ice as Anna did before under the frozen heart curse, though unlike Anna, who turned to solid ice instantaneously, Elsa's transformation was slower and more painful, allowing her time to release one last spell to show Anna the truth before it was lost and she turned into solid ice completely, entombed in Ahtohallan's depths for possibly forever. In this state, her powers are depleted, and all those connected to it are drained of their magic, as Olaf's life faded due to her magic leaving him, reducing him to just a pile of snow. Only when Anna tricks the Earth Giants into breaking the dam trying to attack her and breaks the curse does Ahtohallan restore Elsa from her solid ice state back to flesh and blood so she can then save Arendelle from the resulting flood waters with aid from the Nokk, and later revive Olaf as well, having remembered what he said about water having memory during their journey.

One interesting thing to note is that when the animators created her character and came up with ways for her to use her abilities, they came up with a Signature Snowflake for her. This snowflake can be seen multiple times throughout the film on almost everything she creates. Such instances are when she slams her foot into the ground to create the floor of her ice palace in "Let It Go", the pattern on the doors that led to the balcony of her ice palace, and it is the snowflake shown within the "O" in the in-movie logo. When she establishes a connection with the four elemental spirits, their symbols become associated with her, and they appear from her magic and the crystals on her dress.

In Frozen Fever, she can use her powers to create precise effects other than manifesting ice and snow, as she made several color changes to her and Anna's dresses, using flowers in the room and integrated them into their gowns using crystalline ice. She was also shown to create ice sculptures out of thin air and reshape them in any way she wanted. She can also create many miniature snowmen whenever she sneezes throughout the short film while she was suffering from the flu as Anna saw her condition and can make a giant snowball when she blows the horn to celebrate Anna's 19th birthday.

In Frozen II, as the fifth elemental spirit, Elsa's powers have grown immensely. Even at the beginning of the film, small releases from her hands were able to form thick frost around whatever it touched. Combined with honed concentration, Elsa can conjure her magic in impressive and stronger forms, from controlling all the ice particles to create lifelike ice sculptures of people from memory to trying to cross the dark sea by freezing the deadly waves from the sea. Whereas Frozen showed she could manipulate the flow of snowflakes, her control over heavier forms of ice has been demonstrated, as shown during “Show Yourself" when Elsa lifted the ice pillars through the air with the whisk of her hands as if they weighed nothing. When the fire spirit attack, Elsa was able to extinguish an entire forest floor covered in fire, however, this temporarily exhausted her due to her using it constantly to burn out other fiery areas, which suggests that if Elsa uses a great deal of her power too much, it could tire her out. Elsa also seems to have limited control over water, perhaps in reference to the element of ice being frozen water. In particular, Elsa willed the seawater in the floorboards of her parents' sunken ship to rise and coalesce into the desired image, which the water did, floating and evaporating from the ground before condensing into the statue depicting her parents' tragic fate.

Due to her status as an elemental, Elsa has a magic connection with the four elements and an ability to sense when they are nearby. Consciously and unconsciously, she was able to quiet both the wind spirit and the fire spirit with ice during their stay at the Enchanted Forest, attract the Earth Giants’ attention, and tame the water spirit through magic-conjured reins. As the fifth spirit and being able to tame the other four, Elsa is the most powerful magical being, second only to Ahtohallan.

Magical powers aside, though coupled with them, Elsa also appears to be considerably fast and agile. During “Show Yourself”, she performed incredible parkour attributes, e.g., sliding on ice with great balance and leaping from one ice-made structure to another. Before confronting the Nokk, she outmaneuvers the massive water waves of the Dark Sea, though not without effort. Additionally, she showed above-average physical strength as when wrestling with the Nokk and binding him in magically created reins.

Elsa proves that she is notably creative and strong in geometry. This is shown when she uses her knowledge of geometry to create her ice palace and describing her snow designs as ‘fractals’, an advanced geometry concept for the period. The sequel showed that she has a keen eye for detail and engineering, creating many items with her powers. When asked to create a sextant for a young girl Elsa expressed an unsureness, hinting that she has to be aware of the general structure of the item she tries to create but was able to create one perfectly, just as easily as her other gifts.

Elsa demonstrated herself to be an incredibly fast learner; despite facing two armed thugs and having no formal training, Elsa was able to defeat and nearly kill both men with her magic. And despite not using her magic for a long time, Elsa gathered enough confidence after producing a few blasts of snow to build an ice staircase and an entire ice palace. Elsa also was able to magically weave herself a new dress and cape.

Even though she has magical powers, Elsa is physically formidable as well, having had enough endurance to run well into the night from Arendelle all the way to the North Mountain.

Elsa also possesses a degree of artistic skill, as she was able to base an entire palace design on a snowflake. In fact, Elsa repeatedly showed herself using the same snowflake design; it appeared on the palace floor and on the palace doors, ice chandelier, her clothes and hair accessories, and even on Anna's frozen form. In another showcase of her artistic skill, Elsa froze the water in the courtyard fountains into an intricate design and used ice to decorate the whole castle. When Elsa was frozen solid by Ahtohallan's curse after traveling too deep into its depths to find the truth to pacify the angry spirits, her frozen body sported the same snowflake design from all her previous creations on it alongside the star of the Elemental Spirits to signify both her Snow Queen and Fifth Spirit status, at least until she was restored to flesh and blood by Anna breaking the curse by destroying the dam.

Frozen
A young Elsa working her magic in front of young Anna.
Princess Elsa was born with power over ice and snow. As a child, she often used her abilities to play with her younger sister and best friend, Anna. One night, eight-year-old Elsa is awakened by five-year-old Anna, who wants to play. Elsa refuses until Anna asks her sister if she wants to build a snowman. Elsa agrees, and the two head into the castle's throne room and create a winter field of snow. At one point, Elsa accidentally strikes her sister in the head, giving her a platinum blonde streak of hair and knocking her out cold. Their parents, King Agnarr and Queen Iduna, sought aid from legendary trolls residing in the Valley of the Living Rock. Their leader, a shaman named Pabbie, is able to stabilize Anna's condition by cleansing her of all magic (including memories). Pabbie warns Elsa of the danger her power poses, and stresses that she must learn to control them. Traumatized by the event, Elsa spends her life distanced from other people, including Anna, to avoid harming them. With no memories of Elsa's magic, Anna takes Elsa's distance personally, creating a rift between the two. Throughout her childhood, Elsa is taught to control her abilities by suppressing her emotions. To help even further, Agnarr gives Elsa a pair of gloves, which were temporarily able to suppress her powers (teaching her to "conceal it, don't feel it, don't let it show").

A nervous Elsa during her coronation.
During Anna and Elsa's teenage years, Agnarr and Iduna die at sea. Elsa does not attend the funeral, as her distraught state of mind causes her to lose control of her powers. Three years later, Elsa has come of age and is now ready to be crowned the new queen regnant. To celebrate the momentous occasion, Arendelle invites royalty from far and wide to join in the festivities, such as the dashing Prince Hans and the pompous Duke of Weselton, among others. Though she accepts her responsibility to the throne, Elsa fears that her still-unstable powers will cause harm to her subjects and guests. She copes by keeping her gloves at hand and reminding herself that the gates will only be open for the day. At the coronation ball, Elsa and Anna share their first (albeit stilted) conversation after quite some time, with Elsa leading the way. Their interaction proves that the connection between them is still there, but the reality of their situation starts to overwhelm Elsa, who distances herself once again while a crestfallen Anna excuses herself in response.

Elsa's powers revealed at the ball.
Later that night, Anna returns with Prince Hans by her side. The two announce their engagement and ask for Elsa's blessing. Cautious of Hans, Elsa denies their wishes, saying that Anna shouldn't marry a man she just met, much to Anna's disappointment. The two begin to argue over the situation, upsetting Elsa to the point of ending the party and ordering the gates to be closed. A furious Anna confronts her sister, which only increases Elsa's anxiety. Overwhelmed with frustration, Elsa accidentally unleashes her powers upon Anna and the guests, who look upon their queen with fear (the Duke of Weselton even declares Elsa a monster and calls for her arrest). Horrified by her actions, Elsa sentences herself to exile and retreats into the fjord to protect the kingdom from herself. As she does, Elsa unknowingly plunges Arendelle into an eternal winter. Feeling responsible for the catastrophe, Anna sets out to find her sister, leaving Hans in charge during her absence.

Later that night, Elsa arrives at the North Mountain, where she comes to the conclusion that isolation is the only way to protect both herself and her people. Feeling less restrained as a result, Elsa experiments with her powers by building a snowman (whom she unknowingly imbues with life). She then claims the North Mountain as her new home, establishes herself as the Snow Queen, and creates a towering ice palace in which she plans to spend the rest of her days in solitude. Meanwhile, Anna has since partnered up with a mountain man named Kristoff, who agrees to act as the former's escort to the North Mountain. Along the way, they encounter the snowman that Elsa had created, who offers to guide them through the rest of their journey to Elsa's palace. Unfortunately, Anna's prolonged absence causes concern back in Arendelle. Hans comes to worry that Anna is being held prisoner by Elsa, and rallies together a group of volunteers to help him rescue her. The Duke of Weselton volunteers his own bodyguards to join the prince, with orders to kill Elsa in hopes that her death will end the winter.

Elsa losing control of her powers and freezing Anna's heart.
At the palace, Elsa is initially elated to see Anna again, but remains firm on her decision to stay at the North Mountain. She encourages Anna to return to Arendelle where she'll be safe, but Anna reveals that Arendelle has been cursed with eternal winter. The news comes as a shock to Elsa, who becomes overwhelmed with guilt over what she's done. Despite Anna's attempt to calm her sister, Elsa falls into a fit of panic and accidentally unleashes her powers once again. This time, however, they inadvertently strike Anna in the heart, which Pabbie has said previously would be fatal. With Elsa's powers becoming increasingly unstable due to stress, the Snow Queen demands that Anna leave the palace for her own safety. When Anna refuses, Elsa creates a gruesome snow-monster to forcibly remove Anna and her friends and ensure that they never return. Following Anna's departure, Elsa fearfully paces back and forth within the confines of her palace as she desperately tries to seize control over the curse. All of her attempts are futile, and her bleak state of mind is reflected in the palace's now-distorted interior.

A provoked Elsa in battle with the soldiers.
Meanwhile, the effects of Elsa's curse starts to take its toll on Anna. She and Kristoff seek assistance from Grand Pabbie, who explains that Anna will turn into solid ice forever and can only be saved by performing an "act of true love". Believing this to be "true love's kiss", Anna and Kristoff begin their journey back to Arendelle to receive a kiss from Hans. That morning, Hans and his guardsmen arrive at the North Mountain, where they are confronted by Marshmallow. Upon hearing the commotion, Elsa flees inside to avoid combat, with the Duke's goons in hot pursuit. They manage to corner the Snow Queen and attempt to carry out their orders, which forces Elsa to retaliate in defense. Eventually, the goons are overwhelmed by Elsa's power, but Hans calls out to the queen before she can murder the two. Upon realizing the monster she's becoming, Elsa pulls herself back. One of the goons seizes the opportunity to aim his crossbow at the Snow Queen in hopes of killing her, but Hans intervenes and alters the bolt's path, causing it to cut through Elsa's chandelier instead. The chandelier plummets toward the ground and the impact of the collision knocks Elsa unconscious. She is subsequently apprehended by Hans and his army, and taken back to Arendelle.
