The Beast is the male protagonist of Disney's 1991 animated feature film, Beauty and the Beast. A prince by birth, he was cursed into becoming a monster by a mysterious Enchantress as punishment for his selfish and cruel manners. Only loving another and earning their love in return can free the Beast and those affected by the spell before time runs out.

As the film is based on the traditional fairy tale of the same name, the Beast is based on the corresponding character from that fairy tale.

Official Description
Development
The earliest versions of the Beast were intended to closely parallel the character in the original fairy tale; originally, the Beast was planned to be humble, gentleman-like, and had a generally welcoming personality, with only an occasional temper. As the film's development progressed, the directors felt changing this aspect would help add dimension to the Beast, but also promote the film's primary moral: "True beauty comes from within."

The Beast's design went through many changes during the film's production; at first, most of the initial sketches were little more than humanoids with the head of an animal attached. Desiring a more unconventional model, the filmmakers began brainstorming more unique designs, including a mantis-like version. Chris Sanders was responsible for helping come up with the basic design of the Beast. He went from insect forms, avian forms, and fish forms until he finally got the right design. Glen Keane, the supervising animator for the Beast, then studied various animals to modify the design and base it around real-life creatures as opposed to alien. Ultimately, Keane was inspired to make the Beast a combination of the variety of animals he studied, feeling that this design truly represented the character he envisioned.

In fear that Keane would design the human Beast to resemble his voice actor Robby Benson, then-Disney Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg did not allow Keane to see Benson during the production of the film. However, according to the filmmakers, not a lot of effort was put into the Beast's human design. The creators claimed that regardless of what he looked like, they felt the majority of those who watched the film would likely end up not liking his human appearance, simply because he no longer felt like the character whom the viewers bonded with through the film.

Personality
From his first introduction, the Beast is sentient and capable of human speech. It originally appeared to be irritable, spoiled, selfish, and temperamental, and came off as very hostile, even towards his servants. Yet he also had a very bitter outlook on his life and was quick to become frustrated and pitch a fit when things did not work his way, showing a spoiled side to his personality. Though these sides of his personality seemed contradictory, they both stemmed from his upbringing as a prince, since his privileged life made him selfish and inconsiderate during his youth, and also led to his curse in the first place when he refused to offer hospitality to strangers. The Beast's dire situation only exacerbated his temperamental nature further but introduced a deep sense of insecurity and shame because of what his past actions had cost him.

The Beast's greatest conflict was dealing with his hideous appearance and the retention of his humanity. Although he desired to break the curse, the Beast's dual nature made him truly uncertain of ever becoming human again, especially when many could not even recognize him as once being human. The Beast was ashamed of the monstrous aspect of himself; it was a reminder of both what he had done and what he had become. His shame held a stronghold on him, where often the first thing that often set off his temper was when others reacted to his appearance or his inhuman instincts. These cases created a self-fulfilling cycle, where the Beast reacted with a vicious behavior because he was seen as a vicious creature. Despite appearing infuriated when this became an issue, it was indicated that he could feel guilty for his behavior afterward; his first interactions with Belle left him feeling morose believing she would only see him as a monster, and later on when his temper got the better of him that he unintentionally scared away Belle, which only supported his doubts, so much so that he saves her life afterward to make up for his earlier behavior.

Though the Beast is stubborn and lacks manners, he is not without a kind side; the Beast can care for others but has difficulty in overcoming his own flaws to express empathy. In addition, his temper belies the Beast's naivety with the world and how to display his feelings towards it. He is best described by his animator Glen Keane as "a twenty-one-year-old guy who's insecure, wants to be loved, wants to love, but has this ugly exterior and has to overcome this". His softer nature was hinted at during his first appearance when he appeared to feel genuinely regretful towards Belle after he sent her father away without letting her say goodbye. Though seemingly aloof, the Beast is not completely apathetic, as he was able to also empathize with Belle and her own misery from his past experiences as a fellow outcast.

As a side effect of the curse, he was somewhat primal and had a habit of animalistic behavior, from serious social regressions like growling and roaring when angry to arbitrary, slightly humorous traits like forgetting his table manners. These traits also likened him to that of an untamed animal towards strangers. According to the film's producer Don Hahn, the Beast's spell is not just physical but psychological as well. The longer the Beast is under the spell, the more feral he becomes (meaning if he stays a beast longer, he becomes more like an animal). If Belle had never arrived at the castle, he would have eventually stopped speaking, walking upright, wearing clothes altogether, and would have gone to live in the woods among the wild animals to fend for himself.

The film's commentary also implied during the wolf attack scene that he was suicidal, or at least did not value his life too strongly, due to the hopelessness of ever breaking the curse. This was further supported in the Marvel Comics where the Beast, after saving Belle and Chip after they were trapped in a very serious snowstorm, thanked Belle for saving his life, as her presence caused him to realize his own life was not "meaningless" after all and in the climax to the film with his refusal to defend himself or even his servants when the castle was attacked by the villagers and Gaston, instead insisting that Mrs. Potts just let them come in to kill him and then taking Gaston's attacks with a depressed look on his face and waiting for the finishing blow, only counter-attacking when he realized that Belle had returned to him.

Once the Beast begins to care for Belle after rescuing her from a pack of wolves, he changes from brutish and temperamental to becoming more agreeable and gentle. He even attempts to become civilized again for Belle's sake, relearning table manners and feeding birds, despite his beastly mannerisms. In turn, Belle's acceptance of him despite appearance begins to show his more positive side, and he becomes progressively selfless. Learning to care for Belle also reveals a fiercely loyal side to him, as he was willing to give anything and everything to protect Belle and keep her happy, even if it meant sacrificing his own happiness by letting her leave him, even before she can return his love to break the curse.

In contrast to his earlier personality where he was bad-tempered and easily irritated, near the end of the enchantment the Beast has matured significantly. For instance, he is unfazed by Gaston's taunts over his ugliness during their duel on the castle rooftop, much to the chagrin of Gaston who was expecting these insults to goad the Beast into a straight-up fight where Gaston would have the advantage. The Beast instead relied on patience and cunning to gain the element of surprise and upper hand over Gaston.

Physical appearance
The Beast is not of any one species of animal, but a chimera, a mixture of several animals. He has the head structure and horns of a buffalo, the arms, claws and body of a bear, the eyebrows of a gorilla, the jaws and mane of a lion, the tusks of a wild boar and the legs, teeth, and tail of a wolf. The Beast also bears resemblance to mythical monsters like the Minotaur or a werewolf. He also has blue eyes, the one physical feature that does not change whether he is a beast or a human.

Originally, the Beast is seen shirtless, with ragged, dark gray breeches, and a ragged reddish-colored cape with a golden colored circular-shaped clasp. Despite the actual color of his cape is a dark wine red color, The Beast's cape is more often referenced to be purple. The reason for this change in color is unknown, although the most likely reason is that the color purple is often associated with royalty.

After the Beast saves Belle from a pack of wolves, his dress style changes, reflecting a more refined personality, as it becomes more disciplined. On the day he showed Belle the library, the Beast wore a white long-sleeved collared shirt with a dark blue cape and blue clasp and dark blue pants. While having lunch with Belle, the Beast wore a green vest with gold trimmings, white cuffs, a light green collar, and a white handkerchief. He also wore a white dress shirt with black pants and a light blue sash, as well as an indigo cape with magenta underneath while feeding birds. The most referenced form of dress is his ballroom outfit, which consists of a golden vest over a white dress shirt with a white kerchief, black dress pants trimmed with gold, and a navy blue ballroom tailcoat trimmed with gold, worn during the film's ballroom dance sequence. The Beast also tied the back of his fur similar to a ponytail adorned with a medium blue ribbon. In the climax, he is shown wearing a mixture of the above, tattered dark purple pants, his red cape, as well as a white long-sleeved collared shirt.

The Beast's human form is that of a tall and slender young man named Prince Adam (though not as tall as the height of the Beast). He has fair skin, shoulder-length light auburn hair, while also retaining his bright blue eyes. Other than the immediate aftermath of regaining his human form (wearing the clothes he wore as the Beast at that time), he is only ever seen in a more "human" version of his ballroom attire, simply with a pair of brown dress boots with light brown folded sleeves and his hair tied in a low ponytail adorned with a blue clip. In Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas, the human form's ballroom outfit had darker brown dress boots with gray folded sleeves.

Powers and abilities
Beast form: Owing to his savage, bestial nature, the Beast has animalistic fighting powers in his beast form:

Enhanced Strength: The Beast possesses tremendous strength, as he is able to pick up and carry full-grown men like Maurice and Gaston and not only lift but also throw large oak wood furniture when enraged, such as banquet tables and Forte's keyboard and allowing him to leap several feet in a single bound in terms of height and distance. He also was able to destroy furniture in a single chop, especially when he was enraged. Similarly, his strength was also such that slamming a door can cause destructive waves to occur several feet away, as evidenced by his reaction after Belle refused to dine with him: After Beast stormed back to the West Wing, he slammed the door to the hallway with enough force to actually cause portions of the ceiling to collapse above Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Potts. His forcefulness of opening a door can also cause powerful gusts that can extinguish the flames in a fireplace, as evidenced by his on-screen debut after the prologue when he burst into the room Maurice was in. He was also able to overpower Gaston despite the hunter’s own strength.
Enhanced Speed and Agility: The Beast is able to move faster than ordinary humans. He has been seen running into the woods on two different occasions and arriving just in time to save Belle and is able to climb and evade punches and blows from weapons dealt from Gaston.
Enhanced Durability: He is slightly more durable than normal humans, as seen when he has taken attacks from a pack of wolves, being shot by Gaston's arrow, and been blasted by Forte's magical energy, although feeling great pain and being knocked down from these attacks. However, he was temporarily slain by Gaston’s dagger.
Enhanced Healing: The Beast is able to heal faster from minor to moderate injuries than ordinary humans, such as bites and claw scratches from a pack of wolves within a few days and being able to survive to be in icy cold water and walking back to his castle in cold winter weather within a few hours.
Enhanced Senses: All five of his senses are animal-keen, and enabling him to track down Belle in the woods when she was in danger by scent and listening in on conversations from several feet away from other people. However, even his enhanced senses, or at least sight, smell, and hearing, can be drowned out by a particularly deadly blizzard, as evidenced by his being unable to find Belle in a particularly severe blizzard in one of the Marvel Comics until a bushel of hollies hits him in the head and allowed him to trace her location in time.
Claws and Fangs: The Beast possesses razor-sharp claws and fangs that enable him to rip through thick rugs and curtains as well as smash objects such as oak furniture to splinters when enraged, climb up and down the stone walls of his castle and bite down and hold objects. These, however, also proved to be a weakness, as his razor-sharp claws also resulted in books being shredded whenever he attempted to read them, as evidenced in New Adventures of Beauty and the Beast, when he attempted to read some poems, only for the pages to be shredded quickly.
Stealth: The Beast was shown to be adept at stealth, keeping himself hidden without anyone being able to detect him in time. This was especially apparent when he managed to ambush Belle just after she discovered Maurice in the dungeon and confronting her again when she was just about to touch the Enchanted Rose, as well as easily surprising the pack of wolves pursuing Belle. He also managed to sneak up on Gaston by posing as a gargoyle, though the latter managed to detect the attack and strike back.
Human form:

Skilled Hunter: In his human form, the Beast also was skilled with firearms and was presumably a hunter, at least according to New Adventures of Beauty and the Beast, although his actions during hunting were closer to poaching than true hunting due to specifically targeting a fawn (baby deer) until a crow (implied to be the Enchantress in disguise) interfered with the shot.
Learned Reader/Scholar: When he was a human, at least according to New Adventures of Beauty and the Beast, he was shown to be extremely studious and a gifted reader, with his, even once admitting that at one point books meant more to him than anything else in the world. However, when he became a Beast, due to the psychological nature of the curse, he largely forgot how to do so, and was left unable to physically handle books due to his claws shredding the books.
Horseback Riding: As a child, the Beast also is shown to be skilled at horseback riding, frequently using Thunder to ride around. However, he was unkind and cold to his steed, eventually resulting in Thunder escaping.
Appearances
Beauty and the Beast
An ashamed Beast concealing himself within his castle.
Many years ago, the Prince named Adam was a handsome young man, but also selfish, unkind, and spoiled. He lived in a beautiful luxurious castle deep in a forest in France and had everything he ever wanted. One night, on Christmas Eve, his kindness was put to the test when an old beggar woman came to the castle and pleaded for shelter from the freezing cold and rain, with a single rose as payment. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, he sneered at the simple, but beautiful gift, and turned the woman away. She warns the Prince not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within. When the Prince shuns the beggar woman again, her ugliness melts away, transforming into a beautiful and powerful Enchantress. Seeing her beauty and realizing her power, the Prince tries to apologize, but it is too late, for she had seen in her disguise that there was no love in his heart. As punishment for his cold heart and cruelty, she transforms him into a terrifying beast. She also casts a ghastly spell on the entire castle, transforming it into a dark, foreboding place, its lush green grounds into dark, misty, wolf-infested woods, and the good-natured servants into anthropomorphic household objects to reflect their different personalities. Ashamed of his new appearance, the Beast conceals himself inside his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world.

The rose the Enchantress had given him was enchanted, and it would bloom until his twenty-first year. She had told him that if he could learn to love another and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken, but if he failed, he would be doomed to remain a beast forever. In his first animated appearance (set some time before his twenty-first year, as evidenced by the rose not having bloomed fully yet), he also scratches a portrait of his human self in anger and shame upon being reminded of his previous appearance before the Enchantress cursed him (seeing his former self as a fool). This anger soon gives way to despair and hopelessness as the years go by, for he becomes convinced that no one could ever love a beast.

Belle promised the Beast to stay in the castle.
Ten years later, the Beast discovers Maurice inside the castle and accuses him of illegal trespassing (not knowing that Maurice was actually allowed inside by the servants for shelter, despite Cogsworth’s efforts to send him out, fearing that the Master will be furious when he finds a stranger in his castle). Maurice's stare at the Beast only provokes the Beast's fury and he proceeds to "give Maurice a place to stay" by locking Maurice in the tower as a prisoner. Sometime later, Maurice's daughter, Belle, arrives to find him, but soon confronts the Beast herself and pleads with him to let her father go, offering herself as a prisoner instead. The Beast, astonished by Belle's offer, ultimately accepts, under the further condition that she remains in the castle forever, as well as heeding her request to step into the light to reveal himself to her, horrifying Belle once she sees his monstrous form. He then brashly throws Maurice into an enchanted coach to take him back to the village he came from without letting Belle say goodbye to her father first.

The Beast then decided to give Belle an actual room instead of the dungeon cell (both at Lumiere's suggestion and due to feeling some remorse at Belle's sadness from his prior actions). He tells Belle that she is free to go to any part of the castle she likes, with the exception of his chamber, the West Wing, which he strictly warns her against going into. He then "invites" her to dinner, although it was much closer to command than a request. The Beast later waited for Belle to join him for dinner, although because of her residual anger towards the Beast for his earlier actions and grief towards her father being released before she said goodbye, Belle did not join him, citing as an excuse that she wasn't hungry, and refused to come down even when twice (albeit reluctantly) politely making requests to come down to dinner, incensing him enough to have her starve for the evening and later causing him to despair upon overhearing Belle's negative comments about him with the Wardrobe and her implication that she would never fall in love or have anything to do with him. Although he had specifically forbidden her from visiting the West Wing, she does later on out of curiosity. The Beast is furious with Belle not only for disobeying him but also for almost touching the enchanted rose in fear that she would of destroyed it and thus prevented the spell from being broken. Belle tries apologizing, but his rage caused him to destroy much of his chambers while screaming at her to get out.

Beast and Belle share a waltz.
Realizing his mistake, the Beast pursues Belle after she flees the castle, arriving just in time to rescue her from a pack of wolves and getting injured in the process (Lumiere and Cogsworth probably tipped him off about where Belle went). After Belle helps him back to the castle, she starts tending his wounds, but the two then enter another brief argument about who is at fault, with Belle effectively winning the argument. As Belle, having conquered the Beast's ferocious temper, continues to tend to his injuries, she thanks him for saving her life, to which the Beast, realizing the deed he has just done while noticing her kindness, starts feeling good inside himself. The Beast, who has never felt considerate before, accepts Belle's gratitude and later finds he wants to do something good for her, but initially can't decide what. At Lumiere's suggestion, he shows Belle the castle's enormous library, which strikes her interest so much that he decides to give it to her as a gift. She then in return helps him behave more civilized. During one evening date, Belle teaches the Beast how to dance in the ballroom; during which, the Beast falls in actual love with her. Placing her happiness before his own, he releases Belle to tend to her sick father (and to make up for his earlier harsh treatment of her father) when Belle discovers Maurice lost in the woods. He then gives her the magic mirror as a present to remember him by. As Belle departs on Phillipe, he gives out a mournful roar that echoes through the castle.

Beast in battle with Gaston.
Later, a lynch mob comes to kill the Beast, led by a jealous rival suitor named Gaston (with Belle, albeit unintentionally, instigating the mob by exposing his existence to save Maurice from the paddy wagon). Gaston eventually finds the Beast, and initially, the Beast has no will to fight, still in a state of depression from Belle leaving. Just as Gaston is about to bring the final blow, Belle returns, calling for Gaston to stop. Upon hearing Belle's voice and seeing her, the Beast suddenly stands and fights back with a renewed vigor in the knowledge that Belle truly does care about him. As the fight continues, Gaston brags about his superficial beliefs that he is Belle's true love, and the Beast is nothing more than a monster whom Belle will never love. Finally fed up with Gaston's taunts and arrogance, the Beast overpowers him and holds him by the throat over the edge of the castle moat. Gaston finally drops his pride and pathetically begs for mercy, which the Beast initially ignores. But upon realizing that he is turning into everything that represents Gaston himself (not to mention that Belle would never allow him to take the latter's life, despite her animosity towards the hunter), the Beast instead spares his life and angrily yet calmly tells him "get out."

Just then, Belle arrives at the castle's balcony and calls out to the Beast, who turns and climbs his way up toward her. Reuniting with Belle, he happily embraces her but is then stabbed in the back by Gaston. This sudden twinge of excruciating pain causing him to rear backward to try and endure it. Belle manages to grab hold of the Beast and pull him onto the balcony while Gaston, knocked off balance by the Beast, falls off the castle to his death. After helping the Beast onto the balcony surface, Belle turns his face towards her. The Beast smiles at seeing Belle, who tries to reassure him that everything's going to be fine, but he knows all too well that his time is coming, telling her how grateful he is to have a chance at seeing her one last time before succumbing to his wounds. Upon losing him, Belle begs him not to leave her. She breaks down into tears and admits her love for him, mere seconds before the last petal falls from the enchanted rose.

Beast after being turned back to his human form.
As Belle continues sobbing over the loss of her love, shimmering beams of light fall onto the Beast, whose body then begins to float in the air and becomes enshrouded in his own cape and surrounding fog as he begins to transform: his fore-paws, hind-paws, and furry head respectively turn back into the hands, feet, and head of Prince Adam, and he is returned to normal. He then gets up, looks at himself, and turns to Belle, who initially looks at him skeptically before recognizing him by his blue eyes. Adam and Belle share their first kiss that further breaks the additional spell the Enchantress had placed on the castle and its inhabitants: the castle is restored to its original, shining state and all the his servants, including Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Lumiere, and Chip, are transformed back into humans. The film ends with Belle and the Prince dancing in the ballroom, surrounded by his servants and her father watching them happily.

In the Special Edition, his role is unchanged, except for a small scene that was added where we see the Beast's struggle to read, a trait he knew as a human but was taken away after his transformation. This is during the song only included for the Special Edition DVD, "Human Again". In addition, in the Special Edition version of the film, as soon as Beast gives out a mournful roar that echoes through the castle, glass-smashing and furniture-knocking sound effects are heard as the camera pans upward to the West Wing balcony, implying that Beast, in a fit of despair, destroyed and messed-up the West Wing off-screen, in order to better connect the "Human Again" musical number with the climax from the main film where the West Wing was still in disrepair.

Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas
Beast in Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas.
In the midquel, which takes place not long after the Beast rescued Belle from the wolves, much to the Beast's frustration, Belle wants to celebrate Christmas and throw a real Christmas party. The Beast hates the idea of Christmas, for it was the very day when the Enchantress cast the spell on him and the entire castle ten years ago; he also was ungrateful for his gift that day, a storybook. For this reason, the Beast has forbidden Christmas, just to keep history from repeating itself. While the Beast sits most of the preparations out, a treacherous servant plot to have Belle thrown out of the castle: Forte the Pipe Organ since he is far more appreciated by the Beast while under the spell.

Unknown to the Beast, Belle writes him a special book which he doesn't see until later on. She also meets Forte later on in a chance meeting. Forte tells her that the Beast's favorite Christmas tradition when he was a child was the Christmas tree. Belle becomes frustrated, for no tree she has seen on the grounds has been tall enough to hang ornaments. He then lies to Belle, saying that a perfect tree can be found in the woods beyond the castle. Reluctant to go against the Beast's orders that she never leaves the castle, Belle leaves nonetheless in order to find the perfect tree. When Belle does not arrive to see the Beast's Christmas present to her, he begins to suspect that she is not there at all. When Mrs. Potts explains that the household cannot find her, the Beast becomes enraged. He goes to Forte to ask for advice, and Forte lies to him that Belle has abandoned him. The Beast finds Belle in the woods and saves her in time from drowning since she fell through thin ice.

Still believing that Belle disobeyed him by leaving the grounds, the Beast ruthlessly throws her into the dungeon. But when Forte goads him into destroying the rose to end his suffering, the Beast finds Belle's book in the West Wing and reads it, coming to his senses and realizing that all Belle wants is for him to be happy, and to put the past behind him. Releasing Belle from the dungeon, the Beast prepares to join in the Christmas festivities. But Forte does not give up and even goes as far as to attempt to destroy the entire castle with Beethoven's 5th. Fortunately, the Beast finds him in time and destroys his keyboard with Franz Schubert's Symphony No 8. Losing his balance (and his pipes), Forte falls from the wall he is leaned up against and is silenced forever. Despite his intentions, the Beast mourns Forte's death with Belle comforting him. When he and the other servants are returned to normal, the Prince and Belle give Chip, Mrs. Potts' son, a book to read, which he loves. As the Prince and Belle come out to the balcony, he gives her something too: a rose.

Belle's Magical World
Beast in Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Magical World.
In the final entry of the franchise, made up of four segments from a presumably failed television series, Belle teaches the Beast a thing or two about life itself, consideration and manners. He appears only in the first and fourth segments, but makes a cameo in the third. Only this time, he is shown to be very different from he was later in the chronological story: he is more foolish, immature, a slacker, and still a brat, according to Belle, and is far more arrogant, foul-tempered, selfish and abusive than he was in other appearances, and therefore somewhat serves as the main antagonist of this film.

In the first part, The Perfect Word, the Beast, and Belle have a bitter falling out at dinner when the Beast demands that Cogsworth opens the windows to cool him down, despite the fact that he is the only one hot and there is a cold wind and states that the castle belongs to him, and only he makes the rules. Eventually, he angrily strikes his servant, Webster, a long-tongued dictionary for giving to synonyms to Belle's ensuing insults. Despite Lumiere and Cogsworth's please, the Beast refuses to apologize for his behavior, until Webster, Crane, and LePlume forge a letter of apology from the Beast to Belle. All is settled until the Beast realizes that it was a forgery. He furiously banishes Webster, Crane, and LePlume from the castle. Belle tries to object, but the Beast orders her to be silent, and tosses the servants out the window, and declares that anyone who gives them comfort would be sorry, but Belle brings them back from the woods, and the Beast soon learns to forgive them, as their intentions were good.

In the fourth (and final) part, The Broken Wing, the Beast loses his temper with Belle again when she brings an injured bird into the castle, as he dislikes birds. As he tries to chase the bird out, however, he falls over on the stairs and hits his head hard, knocking him unconscious and later stripping him of his hatred for birds. However, his selfishness still remains, and he locks the bird in a cage in his room, demanding that it sings for him whenever he demands it. The bird, terrified, refuses until Belle teaches the Beast that the bird will only sing when he's happy. The Beast lets the bird out and learns to consider others before himself.

Earlier on, in the third segment, Mrs. Potts' Party, the Beast makes several cameos sleeping in his bed in the West Wing. The dialogue between Lumiere and Cogsworth shows that he had spent the entire previous night mending leaks in the castle roof, and is still resting. An argument between Lumiere and Cogsworth about Mrs. Potts' favorite flowers lead to them having to hide several bunches of flowers around the Beast's bed. At one point, the Beast begins to smell one of the flowers and almost wakes up, but it is removed just in time, and he falls asleep again.

Once Upon a Time
In Once Upon a Time, the complex Rumplestiltskin serves the role of the Beast.
The role of the Beast in Once Upon a Time, rather than being a prince who is cursed, is actually Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle). He had gained Belle (Emilie de Ravin) in a trade for saving her kingdom from an army of Ogres who were invading. Originally having intended her to be his servant while living in his castle, the two form a bond similar to that of the original fairy tale. Their bond would only grow stronger when Belle would speak with the man about the son whom he lost. However, unlike the original fairy tale and animated Disney classic, the two do not end up together due to an argument, but despite going their separate ways he still holds strong feelings for her, keeping a special chipped tea cup as a reminder of her.

Descendants
Beast in Descendants.
The Beast appears in the Disney Channel original film. Here, he and Belle are the rulers of Auradon, a modern-day kingdom inhabited by various Disney characters, and the parents of a young prince named Ben. He is played by Dan Payne.

At the beginning of the story, his son decides to allow the children of some of the worst villains (namely Maleficent, the Evil Queen, Jafar, and Cruella De Vil) to be transferred from the Isle of the Lost to Auradon. King Beast is initially furious with the idea, but Ben convinces him that the sins of the parents should not be passed on to their children as well. He is dismayed when Ben introduces Mal, the daughter of Maleficent, as his new girlfriend to his parents, and even more so when a fight erupts that results in Chad Charming being put under a temporary sleeping spell.

On Ben's Coronation Day, the Beast passes his crown to his son and thereon his throne. He witnesses the return of Maleficent and also Mal and her friends' heroic deed by defeating her, resulting in them all on Auradon's good graces.

Beast is shown to be very sarcastic, to the point of playfully insulting his wife that he only married her because his only other option was a teapot.

Beauty and the Beast (2017)
The Beast in the 2017 film.
The Beast appears in the 2017 live-action remake, played by Dan Stevens. In this version, Beast is wittier and has a very dry, English sense of humor. While he retains some of his animated counterpart's traits like selfishness, being unkind, and having a spoiled nature, the prince was turned into a beast by the Enchantress for his arrogance, as well as making an explicit reference to his old fixation on beauty above all else. Additionally, unlike the original 1991 animated version where his cruel nature is not explained, a backstory in the live-action version reveals the Prince/Beast's terrible past; the Prince/Beast was raised as a good person by his kind-hearted mother who died when he was a child, leaving his crueler father to raise him alone, which resulted in his cruel behavior. However, he still hints at a strong interest in literature when he shows Belle his library, and is later found reading the book King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. The film also features an original song for the Beast, "Evermore", sung after Belle departs to save her father, where he mourns his belief that he will never find love while aware that Belle's memory will be with him forever. His appearance here, as opposed to combining features of various animals, is instead more explicitly an anthropomorphic lion, but with a pair of large, ram-like horns.

Introduced as a Prince who was selfish and unkind, the Prince approached an elderly woman named Agathe in her hag form and as the Prince refused to accept her offer, she transformed into a beautiful Enchantress. The Prince tried to apologize but it was too late and as punishment, the Prince is transformed into a hideous Beast as the spell is cast all around the castle and in order to break the curse, the Prince must marry a beautiful woman or he will remain a hideous Beast forever before the last petal falls.

As Maurice explores the castle grounds around him, the Beast approaches him as he takes a rose whom he is taking for his daughter Belle, thinking Maurice is a threat. Approaching the Beast, Belle spends a minute alone with the Beast requesting him to see her father just as Belle notices the Beast taking her father away much to her worry.

The Beast then approaches the dining room where he tells Lumiere and Cogsworth who are both preparing dinner for Belle much to the Beast's temper, explaining to Belle that joining him for dinner is not a request, much to the Enchanted objects telling him to be gentle. He later discusses with Belle about joining her for dinner to which she refuses as she remembers he locked her into the tower just as the Beast angrily storms off. The Beast goes to a room where the Enchanted Rose is at, grabbing the Enchanted Mirror to show him Belle to which the mirror shows Belle in her room just as another petal falls.

Later, Belle then tries to ask the Beast, but he angrily scares her away, causing Belle to leave the castle in terror. Belle then rides on Philippe to escape while being chased by a pack of wolves, just as the Beast comes to the rescue, but is injured in process. Later, the Beast is taken to the castle where he is told to control his temper just as Belle puts him to sleep.

Later after singing the musical number "Days in the Sun", Lumiere explains to Belle that if the last petal falls, the Prince will remain a Beast forever and all the castle residents become inanimate objects. The Beast is fully healed the next day. With the Beast healed, he takes Belle to the library as she looks at the library around her in excitement. Later, Belle and the Beast walk outside together just as the couple looks at the frozen lake around them. Belle then teaches the Beast how to be gentle to Philippe and later sings the musical number "Something There" just as she and the Beast start a relationship with them. Later, Belle thanks the Beast for saving from the wolves just as Belle talks to him about the villagers thinking Belle is funny. Back at the library, the Beast shows Belle a book from the Enchantress related to the curse she casted on her. Belle later takes the Beast into Paris where she sings to him that the childhood at Paris is gone just as she remembers her tragic flashback about her mother who died from plague just as the Beast apologizes to her from calling her a thief.
