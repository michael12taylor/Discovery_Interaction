<html><p>During a night's sleep in the palace, Prince Charming dreams of being in the old castle he and Snow White lived in. Hearing a baby's cries, he wanders into an undamaged nursery, where everything from the crib to the toys, appear exactly as how it once was prior to the curse. A grown Emma, dressed prettily in a blue gown, persuades him into a dance as practice for her first ball. Prince Charming is ecstatic, as this is the life he wanted for her, but she abruptly remarks that it is a shame it never happened since he failed her as a father. In an instant, the dream becomes a nightmare, with Emma being sucked into the wardrobe, as he is forced to let her go as she warns him not to "fail the next one". After waking up, Prince Charming receives news from Snow White that they are expecting another child, which shocks him, but he hides his true feelings from her. Unable to shake a foreboding fear, he attempts to calm himself by drinking. A sympathetic Robin Hood suggests that he seek out a plant called night root, which grows at the edge of Sherwood Forest, which can help overcome his fear. On arrival to the location, Prince Charming digs up night root but climbs up a tower when he hears a woman's plea for help. Inside, a princess, Rapunzel, relates how she became trapped after being chased up the tower by a cloaked witch. She, like him, sought out the night root to conquer her fear, but it hasn't worked. He tries to free her, but the cloaked witch intervenes and is unmasked as a manifestation of Rapunzel herself due to the princess consuming the night root. As the witch uses the princess's lengthy hair as a rope to climb up, Prince Charming encourages Rapunzel to fight back, to which she cuts off the tresses and destroys her false twin. They journey to the palace, where Rapunzel reunites with her parents, and Prince Charming admits his worries to Snow White, who reassures him they will face the unknown together.

In the second iteration, his role is given to Marcus Tremaine, being the husband of Rapunzel; as seen in the Season Seven episode "One Little Tear". However, during the time when Mother Gothel disguised herself as Rapunzel in the Season Seven episode "Eloise Gardener", the Wish Realm version of Captain Hook fills the more traditional role of Flynn, attempting to rescue "Rapunzel" from the tower.

Trivia
Zachary Levi auditioned for the role and got it with a British accent. Later, this idea was dropped and Levi read for the role with his natural American accent instead.
In the Brazilian Portuguese dub, his real name (Eugene Fitzherbert) was changed to "Jos√© Bezerra".
Dan Fogler was the original choice to voice Flynn Rider. Clay Aiken was also considered for the role at one time.
With the reveal that King Edmund is Eugene's father in "Destinies Collide", it is confirmed that Eugene is 23 and later 24 years old ("Cassandra's Revenge") during the series, and 22 years old during the movie. This aligns with what the Nathan Greno and Bryan Howard had stated that they personally saw Eugene's age.
Nathan Greno admitted that he personally sees him as being about 22 years old, whereas the story writers see him as being younger than that. Byron Howard also stated that Eugene is about 22 years old. Nathan stated that the early twenties is what they all agreed upon being his age.
This may also indicate that Eugene was 24 years old or older when he married Rapunzel in Tangled Ever After.

This may also indicate that Eugene was 24 years old or older when he married Rapunzel in Tangled Ever After.
Eugene doesn't know his actual birthday. Rapunzel decided to grant him birthday in "Lost and Found", though he later learns it in "Cassandra's Revenge".
By total coincidence, Eugene, in its Greek origin, means "born of nobility", making his name actually foreshadow his true origin as the prince of the Dark Kingdom.
Eugene was originally thought to be the second Disney Prince after Aladdin to become royalty through marriage until it was revealed he is actually a long-lost prince.
As a running gag, every time a wanted poster of Flynn is shown in the movie, his nose is drawn differently.
Eugene is the exact opposite of Mother Gothel. Unlike Gothel, he truly cares for Rapunzel and loves her whereas Gothel only loves Rapunzel for her hair, due to it being able to heal anything or anyone. Eugene's love for Rapunzel was declared when he sacrificed himself and freed her from Gothel's cruel and wicked ways.
One of Flynn Rider's original designs (seen in concept art), was used to help form Kristoff's appearance in Frozen.
Even though his real name is Eugene Fitzherbert, credits for other films and books keep his nickname Flynn Rider.
According to a scratch reel, Eugene mentions that he was named after his father Eugene Fitzherbert Sr.

During renovations of the Walt Disney Animation Studios building, beginning in 2014, Flynn was one of the character silhouettes featured on the wall mural.
In "What the Hair?!", it is shown that Eugene prefers to be called by his actual name and not the "Flynn Rider" alias, as he corrected Varian (in a rather annoyed tone) when he referred to him as the latter.
As seen in "Fitzherbert P.I.", the Captain of the Guards still refers to Eugene as "Rider", as do the Stabbington Brothers (as seen in "Cassandra v. Eugene"). This goes for anyone he's ever encountered in the past.

Rapunzel has considered giving Eugene a nickname like Fitz or Bert since she loves his nickname for her (Blondie), but she decided to keep calling him Eugene since people have called him Flynn Rider in his whole life.
Eugene notes in "Fitzherbert P.I." that he only attended school for three days.
In "Fitzherbert P.I.", Eugene notes that he traversed the world as a thief in the past; during which, he outsmarted guards in numerous regions and became fluent in some foreign languages, such as Italian.
Captain Quaid of Vardaros was the first man to ever arrest Flynn and Lance.
Eugene is referenced in the Sofia the First special "The Curse of Princess Ivy". He is mentioned by Rapunzel when Amber tells her how she was cursed by stealing Sofia's amulet for a selfish want. Rapunzel tells Amber that she must prove that her love for her sister is worth more than anything just as Eugene did.
In the original fairy tale from which Tangled is based, Rapunzel's love interest is a nameless prince. He is riding through the forest and suddenly hears her singing from her tower. He is entranced by her voice and comes back to listen to her day after day. When he finally finds out how to climb the tall tower after seeing the witch visit her, he goes up and introduces himself. He confesses his love and asks her to leave the tower and marry him.
Rapunzel then tells him to visit her every evening and bring some silk thread, so she can weave a ladder long enough for her to climb down and run away with him. However, the witch soon finds out about him when Rapunzel innocently says that her dress is growing tighter around her waist (hinting pregnancy), while other bowdlerized versions have her unthinkingly saying that the witch is heavier to pull up to the tower than the prince.
When the prince comes back that night, the witch lets Rapunzel's severed hair down to haul him up. To his horror, he finds himself meeting the witch instead of Rapunzel, who is nowhere to be found. After saying that he will never see Rapunzel again, the witch throws him out of the tower, sending him falling into a bramble bush, which scratches his eyes and blinds him. For months, he wanders through the wastelands of the country and eventually comes to the wilderness where Rapunzel now lives with the twins she has given birth to, a boy and a girl. One day, as she sings, he hears her voice again, and they are reunited. When they fall into each other's arms, her tears immediately restore his sight. He leads her and their twins to his kingdom, where they live happily ever after.

He hates snow.
It was revealed in "Return of the King" that Eugene's birth name is actually Horace, meaning the orphanage might have given him the name Eugene, which he believes is his real name.
It is mentioned by himself in the episode "You're Kidding Me!" that he is a cat person.
When Eugene first meets Rapunzel in the movie, he says "How ya doin'?" as he flirts with her. This is the same line Joey Tribbiani says when he flirts with women, in Friends.
Eugene and Rapunzel made a cameo appearance in the first Frozen film, which lead to many fans to believe that Rapunzel was related to Anna and Elsa, and that Anna and Elsa's parents were sailing off to attend Eugene and Rapunzel's wedding when their ship went down. However, this theory was proven to be untrue in Frozen II, where it showed the true reason behind the parents' journey and deaths.
Every time Eugene is effected by the decay incantation, he holds his stomach in the same place Mother Gothel stabbed him in the movie.
According to himself in "Lost and Found", Eugene has a book that he writes all the dates he and Rapunzel have been on or that he wants to do.
