<html><p>Cruella realizes that since Henry will not bring her back from the dead, she needs to find an alternate method to return to Storybrooke. She decides to kidnap Zelena's daughter to use as leverage against Hades as he is in love with the Wicked Witch. She and James decide to have the late prince switch places with David, in hopes they can take the child. After James successfully imprisons David, and has his niece powerless as a hostage with Robin Hood, Cruella meets him in the forest to take the baby. She punches Emma, telling her it was payback for killing her (though to be fair, Cruella provoked her own demise), then telling her reasons for wanting the baby. Knowing they won't just hand the baby over, Cruella and James decide to take Emma and Robin to the Underworld harbor, hoping to push them over the docks into the River of Lost Souls. As they are about to push them over, David and Hook arrive. Cruella tries to grab a gun, but Hook takes it first, saying she wouldn't be able to use it anyway. She runs off and takes cover beside a large box on the dock, watching the ensuing fight between David and James. She helps James during the fight, reminding him of the knife he has hidden in his sock. As James tries to stab David, he is thrown into the River. Cruella then flees the area.

Cruella teams up with the Blind Witch.
When a portal to Storybrooke is opened, the heroes can leave the Underworld for good. When Cruella finds out that Hades is also leaving for Storybrooke and that the Underworld will need a new ruler, she changes her mind on being written back to life, instead chooses to stay and rule the Underworld and keep the heroes there as punishment. As Henry begins writing everyone's unfinished business, Cruella approaches the table. After she reveals her plan to the heroes, Regina tells her that it would be impossible for Cruella to keep them there, as her magic can only "make a dog roll over and beg." Cruella agrees, but then the Blind Witch appears, saying she has the right powers, revealing her alliance with Cruella. She blasts them into the Underworld Library and blocks the door with magic, before she walks off with Cruella, who says that eternity is going to be nice after all.

To make sure no one can complete their unfinished business and stay in the Underworld, she takes the Underworld edition of the storybook, and throws it in the River of Lost Souls. As she is enjoying a martini at the diner, Hook approaches her, accompanied by a newly deceased King Arthur, and asks her about the phone booths that were torn down, as he needed to contact Emma back in Storybrooke. She tells him there is nothing left of them, as she had them destroyed. Hook then asks her where the storybook is, and she tells him that she threw it in the River.

At some point, King Arthur takes control of the Underworld away from Cruella and becomes its new ruler. Cruella wakes up in a bar only to be greeted by Mordred, the owner, she asks him for several different drinks, but he refuses believing she has had one too many, she then compliments his skin and asks that she make him into a coat, which he disagrees. Cruella then asks Mordred if he has any ideas of what to do next with their deaths, and Mordred suggests taking Arthur's throne back from him together, as he had planned when he was alive, but Cruella responds with "And how did that work out for you?", he then suggests that they seek redemption, which Cruella also rejects believing that she is incapable of doing good. Mordred then remarks that it is her darkness that makes minor villains look good, and that they should just stay in the Underworld together, which she misinterprets as being the source of darkness that makes goodness possible, making her the hero of the story. She then decides to celebrate by asking for champagne which Mordred decides to give to her, she then asks why she was in the bar in the first place, to which he states that she was celebrating the 50-year anniversary of Arthur becoming the leader of the Underworld, she then wishes Mordred a Happy Anniversary as he walks away.

In the wish realm, another version of Cruella exists. This version was sent by the Wish Realm version of Rumpelstiltskin to stop Henry and Regina in exchange for new furs and permission to kill the very people he's after. Cruella challenges Henry to a sword fight and loses and is then teleported into a dog cage where she is forced to reveal the whereabouts of Jacinda and Lucy and how to free them. Later, when Henry is looking for enchanted ink so he can use the author's pen, he approaches Cruella and uses the pen to extract the ink from her hair, leaving it completely white as she swears vengeance on him.

Descendants
Cruella De Vil in Descendants.
Cruella appears in the Disney Channel Original Movie Descendants, as one of the villains imprisoned in the Isle of the Lost. Cruella is the mother of Carlos De Vil, and she uses her son like a servant. When she mentions that she would miss him if he went to Auradon, she explains "who would touch up my roots, fluff my fur, and scape the bunions from my feet?" She raised Carlos to be cynophobic (afraid of dogs), explaining that she was a "dog yellerer" - an expert. She seems to have gone slightly mad over the 20 years that she's been trapped on the island, given that she usually talks to a toy puppy head on her jacket she named Baby. When she sees that Carlos has adopted a dog named Dude, she thinks it would make a good pair of earmuffs. However, for the very first time, she is told off by her son, who had gained courage from his time in Auradon. "FYI, your dog is stuffed; so give it a rest!" Jafar laughed at her for getting "burned"/dissed by her son. This mockery later led all four villains including Maleficent and the Evil Queen to squabble in embarrassment in front of their kids.

Cruella
A young Estella.
Cruella is the titular protagonist in the 2021 live-action film of the same name, portrayed by Emma Stone. The film tells the story of Cruella's past when she was young and how she became the fur-obsessed villainess in the future.

In this version, Cruella's birth name is Estella. She showed a level of brilliance from a young age and a penchant for fashion design. She was raised by a single mother, Catherine Miller, who struggled to get Estella to conform to societal norms. They decided to leave their small town for London, though Catherine was tragically murdered by three Dalmatians owned by the Baroness before they had the chance to leave. Estella blamed herself for her mother's death as the dogs had been chasing her, unaware at the time that the Baroness Von Hellman had ordered the dogs to kill Catherine. Estella, now orphaned, sought refuge with two petty criminals Jasper and Horace, alongside their one eyed dog Wink and her dog Buddy. As an adult, Jasper helped secure Estella a job with the Baroness's store. It wasn't long before Estella became the right-hand-woman of the Baroness, whom she greatly admired. When she recognized her mother's necklace around the Baroness' neck, she concocted a plan to steal back the necklace, but to do so, she had to embrace her wicked side - Cruella. She donned her true hair and an elaborate gown at a gala, where her efforts to steal the necklace were futile as the Baroness wore it that night. To escape, Jasper released rats and in the ruckus, the Baroness blew a dog whistle that made Estella remember the same action shortly before her mother died. She realized that Baroness had murdered her mother.

Estella's black-and-white hair.
She partnered with Jasper, Horace, and a vintage store owner named Artie to pull off elaborate schemes designed to outshine the Baroness. She also recruited her childhood friend Anita Darling, who used her journalistic connections to spread publicity for Cruella. The only thing the Baroness cared about more than her company, was her image. As Cruella, she pulled off several pop-up shows that caught media attention and won over the general public, all while the Baroness's sales dropped. She operated as Estella during the day, acting as though she helped the Baroness with her fashion designs. All the while, she began to manipulate and verbally abuse Jasper and Horace, who grew tired of her new attitude. Jasper feared that she might go too far with the Baroness' kidnapped Dalmatians, though Cruella brushed off his concerns as her not having been serious about making them into coats. She pulled inspiration from the dogs fur and used it as a print in a dress, which led the public to believe she had murdered Dalmatians for the print.

The Baroness eventually discovered that Estella was Cruella, and attempted to murder her in a fire that would be pinned on Jasper and Horace. Estella was rescued by John, the Baroness's right-hand-man, who heard Estella tell the Baroness of Catherine's murder at the Baroness's hand. John brought her to his home and revealed that the Baroness had an heir that she gave away at birth to be killed by John. He couldn't bring himself to murder the child and instead, gave it to their maid Catherine. John pressed that Estella was the biological daughter of the Baroness and the heir to the family fortune. Baroness abandoned Cruella as her narcissistic nature refused to allow something to exist that could remove attention from herself. Cruella embraced her identity as "Cruella" and said a final goodbye to her adoptive mother. She hatched a plan to rescue Jasper and Horace from prison, made-up for her actions as Cruella, and hatched a new plan to get revenge on the Baroness for the murder of her adopted mother and the attempted murder of herself. She once again partnered Artie and his team of dressmakers. Horace stole her a new car called the Panther de Ville, and pointed out the similarity of "devil" though it was pronounced "de vil". Estella quite liked the name.

She had the guests of a gala wear hairstyles that mimicked Cruella's, and lured the Baroness outside as Estella. She revealed her identity to the Baroness, who feigned remorse for letting "something extraordinary" go, though when they embraced, the Baroness pushed Estella over the cliffs to her death. Estella survived with a well trimmed skirt made into a parachute. With Estella's murder, the Baroness was arrested and the family's fortune was inherited by Cruella de Vil. Now an heiress, Cruella turned the Hellman Hall where the Von Hellman's had resided for years into Hell Hall and made herself quite comfortable in the mansion alongside Jasper, Horace, and Artie.

Some time later, Cruella sent Anita Darling and Roger Radcliffe, the Baroness’ former lawyer now a songwriter, each a Dalmatian puppy, affectionately named Perdita and Pongo.

Printed media
Kingdom Keepers
Cruella appears in the fourth and fifth books in the saga. In Power Play, she and the Evil Queen take over the leadership of the Overtakers when Maleficent and Chernabog are captured. At the end of the book, she mentions she's an important part of the Overtakers, because she knows the ways of the modern world unlike the Queen or Maleficent. In Shell Game, she and the Queen appear again aboard the Disney Dream while following the hyenas who caught the Keepers' scent; she commands the hyenas, giving them names like Happy or Howly. She has a figurative "magic" the Overtakers need to use on Chernabog, but what that is remains unknown. She has also asked "Queeny" to teach her some spells.

The Isle of the Lost: A Descendants Novel
Cruella appears in the prelude to Descendants, where it is shown that she treats Carlos as a slave rather than her own flesh-and-blood, going as far as to have him sleep in an inhospitable coat closet rather than give him a room of his own. She spends a portion of her time at an area on the island that passes for a spa; it serves as one bit of comfort and reminder of her past luxurious life.

Evil Thing: A Tale of That Devil Woman
In this book, Cruella is the protagonist and is the daughter of Lord and Lady De Vil. Her father died when Cruella was sixteen and her mother blamed Cruella for it. Cruella was also friends with Anita Radcliffe and was also expected to keep her last name even after marriage, otherwise her house would go to her mother.

Disney Chills
In this series, Cruella is in book 4, Be Careful What You Wish Fur. Cruella appears as the antagonist/villain to the main character Delia, wanting Delia to give back her fur coat she took, stalking Delia and some puppies constantly, not stopping until she got what she wanted.

Video games
Animated StoryBook: 101 Dalmatians
She appears in the Animated StoryBook, which is based more on her appearance from the first live-action film.

In the "House of DeVil" page, if a music player is clicked, Cruella gets her first musical number titled "I Love Fur", where she discusses her obsession with fur fashion.

Escape from DeVil Manor
In Escape from DeVil Manor (based on Roger's video game from the first live-action film), Cruella is shown to be present at Roger and Anita's wedding.

As Whizzer and Patches look around DeVil Manor, they find her nanny's room with a portrait of a young Cruella ripping the head from a doll, with a nervous nanny behind her. Whizzer and Patches also find Cruella's room from when she was younger, as it seems to suggest she tortured animals in her youth.

When Cruella learns of Whizzer and Patches, she chases them into a mine shaft where they throw a pile of explosives at her, sending her flying into a bathtub in a junkyard, where the police are waiting to arrest her.

102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue
In 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue, Cruella has set up a toy factory next to DeVil Manor. She seems to have tried online dating, where she has supposedly wed herself to Professor Farzboom, a meek professor who helps her make her toys. However, the toy sales are failing, and Cruella suspects it is because the public is spending their money more on animals. She then sends her toys to abduct all the pets in England.

Domino and Oddball confront Cruella on a number of occasions, with her in devices that Farzboom makes for her (such as a helicopter or a boat).

Cruella's plan is to incise the pets of England in a Super Glop made by Farzboom and then sell them as lifelike plush toys.

When Domino and Oddball confront Cruella at her toy factory, they are able to knock her into the vat of Super Glop, with Farzboom jumping in to help her. Afterwards, they are arrested still stuck together. When Cruella angrily asks Farzboom how long will the super glop hold them together, Farzboom cheerfully replies the Super Glop should wear off after 20 years which isn't quite as long as their prison sentence, much to Cruella's horror.

Dottie describes Cruella's scent to be like pepper, a likely homage to how her scent and taste are described in the novel.

Disney Sorcerer's Arena
In this game Cruella de Vil appears as a villainous character from the center, she uses the same abilities from the movie which makes the enemies face her in any event that is hers.

She makes a deal with Hades (under the guise of Boss Teal), to have all the Dalmatians in her possessions in exchange for the legendary crystal of the Magic Kingdom. When word spreads that Pongo has contacted the local dogs to guard the crystal, Cruella sends Jasper and Horace to capture the dogs. They capture a few, but before they are given a chance to eliminate them, the park guests arrives and defeats the hoodlums. Meanwhile, Hades created a fireworks show to distract the citizens whilst Cruella rampages through their homes to find the crystal. Eventually, she breaks into Merlin's secret vault. However, Perdita replaced the crystal with a chew toy, and Cruella breaks down in tears at the fact that she's been outwitted by dogs. After the guests blast her with magic, her coat falls apart, causing her to throw a tantrum and falling beneath the floor.

Cruella appears as one of the villains in the Florida version of Fantasmic!. In the show, Cruella is called forth by the Evil Queen when she plans to destroy Mickey Mouse once and for all with the help of her fellow Disney Villains. In the end, Cruella is killed by Mickey along with the other villains.

In the former castle show, Disney Villains Mix and Mingle, Cruella is summoned by Dr. Facilier (and prior to 2011, Maleficent) to celebrate the dark and sinister style of Halloween.

Cruella is one of the villain suspects in Midship Detective Agency on the Disney Fantasy cruise ship. However, after finding some evidence, it is reveled that Cruella is not responsible for the crime in question, being absent from the ship at the time the crime was committed. Ironically, one of the crimes she was innocent of was the kidnapping of Pongo and Perdie's 99 puppies. So far, Cruella is always innocent.
