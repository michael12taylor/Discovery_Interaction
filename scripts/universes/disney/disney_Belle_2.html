<html><p>Originally, when the first installment of Disney Princess Enchanted Tales was to be released, it was to feature a new Belle story and a brand new Fa Mulan story. The first chapter was entitled "The Kingdom Of Kindness". The plot of Belle's story featured Chip getting in trouble with the Beast after breaking some of his things. Terrified, Chip runs away. Belle finds him and convinces him to come back to the castle, and teaches Beast what it means to be kind. She also teaches Chip that even when people are mad at him, it still means they love him. Only one known song has been written for Belle, this song is called "You'll Never Lose This Love" and is available to watch on the Enchanted Tales Website.

An emoticon version of Belle appears in the Beauty and the Beast entry of the As Told by Emoji short series.

In the series finale of At Home With Olaf, a short clip of Beauty and the Beast featuring Belle and the Beast appears during a montage of heartwarming moments from Disney films playing in Olaf's song "I Am with You".

Once Upon a Time
Emilie de Ravin as Belle in Once Upon a Time.
Belle is a primary character of the hit ABC fantasy television series Once Upon a Time, where she is portrayed by Emilie de Ravin.
Belle is the only child and daughter of Sir Maurice, whose town will be destroyed in the Ogre Wars. Rumplestiltskin offers to protect them if Belle becomes his servant forever. Her father and her fiancée Gaston (Sage Brocklebank) refuse to agree to his terms, but Belle accepts the deal. Over time, the pair fall in love, and Rumplestiltskin asks her to go out and buy straw, expecting that she won't return. On the road, she meets the Evil Queen Regina and learns that true love's kiss will break any curse, including the one on Rumplestiltskin. Belle returns to the castle and kisses him, and he starts changing back into a human. However, he learns that she met the Queen and becomes convinced that she is a spy; this stops the transformation. In his rage, he rejects her love and locks Belle in his dungeon. He then breaks all of his dishware, except the cup that she accidentally chipped. He throws her out of his castle, stating that his power is more important to him than she is. She admonishes him for not believing that she loves him and promises that he will regret it when he is left with an empty heart and the chipped cup. She then leaves and he doesn't see her again. Belle is later seen giving advice on love to Grumpy then known as Dreamy.

Her storyline in the Enchanted Forest involved Mulan in one episode. The two of them hear of a fiery monster causing trouble in the Enchanted Forest. Belle hunts it down and douses it with water. The monster then writes "save me" on the ground. Belle uses fairy dust to help the creature and it turns back into its true form, Prince Phillip. He thanks Belle for saving him and reveals to her that Maleficent cast a spell over him to keep him away from his true love Aurora. Belle then introduces Phillip to Mulan and leaves them to help her true love, Rumplestiltskin. However, soon after she is taken prisoner by Regina. In another episode, Hook goes to Belle's jail cell after hearing that she could be Rumplestiltskin's weakness. He asks her to help destroy him, but she refuses to do so. Hook then knocks her out and leaves.

According to the Queen, Belle was allegedly shunned by her town for her association with Rumplestiltskin and was imprisoned and tortured until she threw herself off a tower and died. However, this is later proven false by her existence in Storybrooke, where Regina keeps her locked in a secret room underneath the Storybrooke Hospital.

She is eventually released by Jefferson. He tells her to find Mr. Gold, who is actually Rumplestiltskin, and to tell Gold that Regina held her captive. She finds Gold but doesn't remember who he is. When the curse on Storybrooke is broken, she regains her memories and professes her love for Rumplestiltskin. He then takes her to his shop, where she makes him promise he won't kill Regina. After Gold releases the Wraith to seek out vengeance on Regina, Belle storms out of the pawnshop, frustrated by his play on words. Later, she comes back to him, where he shows her the chipped cup and she says she will stay with him as "he's a monster".

At the beginning of "The Crocodile", Belle has a dream that Mr. Gold turns into Rumplestiltskin/The Dark One and throws a pickaxe into Leroy's chest. When she wakes up, she sees Mr. Gold in the basement of his house doing magic. The next morning, Belle asks him what he has been doing. Mr. Gold just says "Magic is Power."

Later, her father, Moe/Maurice sends Smee to "kidnap" her, so she could see her father but Moe finds out she still loves Mr. Gold. To fix this "little" problem, her father handcuffs her to a mining trolley and rolls it down a hill, so she can have her memories erased (because when a person crosses the town border, they lose all memory of their true selves). She is rescued by Mr. Gold, Prince Charming/David Nolan, and Red Riding Hood/Ruby. However, once she is rescued, she says she doesn't want to see Mr. Gold and Moe ever again.

Mr. Gold gives Belle the key to the Storybrooke Library and then explains everything from being a coward to Baelfire. He starts to go but Belle stops him, wanting to go with him for a hamburger at Grannies, to which he happily agrees.

Sometime later, Archie is supposedly killed by Regina. Belle, along with the other townspeople, attends Archie's funeral where Mary Margaret gives a eulogy in remembrance of him. Afterward, Belle meets up with Mr. Gold in which he happily tells her the option for crossing the border works. She expresses wishes to go with him, but he regretfully says the option is only enough for one person. She heads to the library, later on, to sort through books and notices a stranger standing in the corner and recognizes him as the man who broke into her cell in the Evil Queen's palace, Captain Hook. In a state of panic, she runs from him but is unable to escape the building. Belle pushes a bookshelf, which topples and pins him to the floor as she scurries into the elevator. Pulling out her cell phone to call Mr. Gold, she is able to tell him about the man trying to kill her, but when she attempts to give more details, Mr. Gold is unable to hear her through the bad reception. Belle doesn't return to the library until Mr. Gold operates the switch to open the elevator shaft.

Reunited, they hurry back to the pawnshop together. On the way there, Belle demands to know Mr. Gold's history with Hook. Hesitantly, he finally tells her Hook stole his wife, Milah, from him years ago. When she asks what happened to his wife, Mr. Gold can only say that she died. When Mr. Gold's cloak is stolen by William Smee, Mr. Gold wants to get back. He gives her a loaded gun to keep in case she ever needs to use it to protect herself. While Mr. Gold is away, Belle goes back into the library. There she finds a knot left behind from Hook and searches through her books about it. Reading the books, she realizes the knot comes specifically from a ship.

Heading to the harbor, she looks up at the seagulls and is surprised to see one of the lands and stand on something invisible. Suspecting something is there but can't see it, Belle takes a pinch of dust and throws it over, revealing stairs leading up to an invisible ship. She goes up the steps until she passes a barrier that leads her onto the ship's visible deck. Belle opens a door below deck and discovers Archie tied up. She uses a sword to cut him free and urges him to get back to town. Then, she proceeds to rummage around the shelves hoping to find Baelfire's cloak. In her distraction, she had put down the gun, and just then, Hook makes himself known to her. She lunges for the gun, but Hook is faster. He threateningly points the gun at her forehead, and while they converse, he reveals to her a truth Mr. Gold didn't tell her―that he killed Milah by ripping out her heart. Belle still believes in Mr. Gold and asserts that she knows he has changed and has good in him even knowing this. She hits him with a rowing paddle and runs away to the above deck while taking the cloak with her.

Mr. Gold shows up to save Belle and proceeds to beat Hook bloody with his cane. Belle pleads that they should leave, but Mr. Gold can't contain his anger at Hook's presence. Finally, he stops when she reminds him of the hope she had in believing he changed and that if he has, to walk away right now. They leave Hook's ship.

That night, Mr. Gold and Belle are at the town border. He uses the potion on himself and steps to the other side of the borderline while his memory stays intact. Belle is very pleased the potion will allow him to find his son. She promises to wait for him in Storybrooke. The heartfelt moment is interrupted when Belle is suddenly shot and pierced in the shoulder, causing her to trip and fall over the border into Mr. Gold's arms and thus lose her memories. Hook is then revealed to be the shooter, stating that now Gold knows how it feels to lose someone he loves. Mr. Gold yells her name in anguish, but she stares at him in confusion, asking, "Who is Belle?"

She is in a frantic and frightened state after she becomes amnesic. Mr. Gold is worried about her injuries, so he magically heals them. Belle is confused and asks him how he did it. An ambulance arrives at the scene and takes Belle to the hospital. While laying in the hospital bed, Mr. Gold tries to trigger her memory with true love's kiss. It's unsuccessful, and Belle screams at Mr. Gold.

Later, Mr. Gold arrives at the hospital with the chipped cup, which he magically charmed. He gives it to Belle in hopes that she remember her past from the Enchanted Forest. The plan doesn't work. Belle is confused and unsure when he mentions magic and tries giving the cup back to Mr. Gold, but he insists she tries. Belle becomes angry and throws the cup, shattering it to pieces. She asks him to leave one final time, and Mr. Gold finally leaves her room in tears. For the time, Belle remains in the hospital until she gets a call from Mr. Gold, who tells her that he knows she doesn't remember who she is, but that she was a beautiful woman who loved an ugly man, and adds that she creates goodness in people. Belle begins to tear up at his words, but he hangs up before she can respond. She is then visited by Regina, who is displeased to hear Mr. Gold will help her. Thinking quickly, she bends down to pick up an item and instead conjures a little red card of the town bar, The Rabbit Hole, and asks if it belongs to. Though Belle says no, Regina suggests she should take a better look at it. Belle glances down at the card, exclaims she remembers who she is. In reality, Regina gave her false memories to replace the memories she lost as Belle. With the false memories, she assumes a new personality and a new name, Lacey.

In the final episode of Season 2, Grumpy gives Mr. Gold some magic from the Blue Fairy to help restore Belle's memories. Mr. Gold restores the chipped cup and pours the magic into it. Belle drinks from the cup and her memories come back. After Henry Mills is kidnapped Mr. Gold decides to go rescue him and tells Belle to look after Storybrooke while he is gone.

In Season 3, Belle had been appearing to Mr. Gold as a vision to guide him through Neverland but it's eventually revealed that she is actually Peter Pan's shadow in disguise. Back in Storybrooke, the real Belle has a difficult time accepting that Rumplestiltskin is gone. Then, with the help of the Dwarfs and the Blue Fairy. She casts a protection spell over the town. Sometime later, Belle meets Ariel. Belle questions Ariel as to why she has come to Storybrooke to which Ariel replies she came from Neverland on a mission for Mr. Gold. Belle is then shocked and relieved Mr. Gold is alive and Ariel tells Belle Mr. Gold needs him to save everyone.

The two head goes to Mr. Gold's shop where Belle is able to use the Sand Dollar given to her by Ariel from Mr. Gold to find the item capable of defeating Pan. However, after finding the item which has turned out to be Pandora's Box they are ambushed by John and Michael Darling now working for Pan and the two of them tie Ariel and Belle up and take the item to destroy it. In order to get out of the ropes, Belle removes Ariel's bracelet which allows Ariel to wiggle free from the ropes and undo Belle's bindings. Ariel then puts the bracelet back on and go after John and Michael.

Belle and Ariel find Michael and John just before they destroy the box. Belle is able to stop them by activating a mine cart on the tracks, which throws Michael and John off their feet. Using the time to her advantage, she grabs the box and kicks their gun away. John and Michael tell Ariel and Belle that Pan has Wendy hostage and if they don't do his bidding he will kill her. Ariel and Belle promise they will help save their sister. Ariel and Belle then go to the coast where she parts ways with Belle and returns to Neverland with Pandora's Box.

When Ariel returns to Storybrooke, Belle helps her reunite with Prince Eric. Mr. Gold and Belle also reunite, but it's only for a few days. Pan casts a curse to destroy Storybrooke and its residents, but Gold stops him and disappears. Regina then casts a spell to send everyone from the Enchanted Forest, including Belle, back to the world they came from.

In the Enchanted Forest, Belle and Neal return to the castle try to find a way to bring Rumplestiltskin back to life. They meet Lumiere in the library, and he tells them they must use a key to open the Vault of the Dark One. When they reach the vault, Lumiere reveals that he has been working under Zelena the Wicked Witch of the West. Baelfire still decides to open the vault despite Belle's warning and his life is exchanged for Rumplestiltskin's. A new curse is later cast and everyone in the Enchanted Forest, including Belle, returns to Storybrooke. After a long battle, Zelena is defeated and taken to jail. Belle tells Mr. Gold not to go after Zelena even though she was responsible for his son's death. However, Mr. Gold kills Zelena behind her back, then he and Belle get married.

In the mid-season finale of Season 4, "Heroes and Villains", Belle learns that Gold chose power over love and so uses his dagger and a gauntlet to make him unfreeze Emma and Mary Margaret and give Hook his heart back. The two then go to the town line where Gold tries to apologize, but Belle doesn't believe him and that he won't ever change and then uses the dagger to banish Gold from Storybrooke. Gold cries out for Belle as she cries over what she has done.

When Gold returns to Storybrooke he stops by the pawnshop and sees that Belle has gotten together with Will Scarlet. Later, to get the dagger back from Belle he takes Hook's appearance and tricks her into giving it to him. Soon Gold, as Hook, goes into the pawnshop and asks her if she is over Gold. She says no but says that Will makes her happy.

As Gold's condition worsens, being consumed by the Dark One's powers, Belle confesses to him that she doesn't love Will. The Apprentice removes the darkness from Gold's heart, though he remains in a comatose state while the darkness is taken in by Emma Swan.

With the other residents, Belle transports to the Enchanted Forest, taking Emma to Camelot in order to find Merlin and remove her darkness. However, weeks later, they return to Storybrooke with missing memories as to how they failed. During her time in Camelot, she helped Merida win back her kingdom while helping the others stop King Arthur and the previous Dark Ones from taking over Storybrooke.

Belle under the Sleeping Curse.
After her memory is restored, Belle remained in Storybrooke but is unaware that Gold, who traveled with Emma to the Underworld to rescue Hook, has reclaimed the powers of the Dark One, and is unaware that she is pregnant with their first child, which is tied to a contract that Hades is using due to Rumplestiltskin having made a deal with a healer back in the Enchanted Forest in exchange for saving Baelfire. Unfortunately, after she is sent through a portal along with Zelena and her daughter, Belle learns the truth from Gold about his reacquired powers and her pregnancy as well as the contract, putting her life and that of their unborn child in jeopardy once again. Motivated by Hades, Gaston moves against Rumplestiltskin with plans to kill him, reuniting Belle with her ex-fiancé. After confronting Gold about his murder of Gaston decades earlier, Belle intends to help Gaston move on, only to learn that Gaston blames her for his death. In an attempt to rescue Rumplestiltskin, Belle inadvertently pushes Gaston into the River of Lost Souls. Consumed with guilt over what she did to Gaston, Belle places herself under a sleeping curse, believing it would give Gold time to protect their child from Hades. Before falling under, Belle makes a Gold promise to return her to her father. It later turns out that Gold's kiss of True Love can't break the spell; Belle had begun losing faith in him again. Later in a dream, Belle's future son, Gideon, helps Belle wake up from the curse. However, the Black Fairy speeds up Belle's pregnancy and kidnaps Gideon. Eventually, the Black Fairy is defeated, Belle forgives Rumplestiltskin for all of his wrong-doings and Gideon is able to restart his life. Belle, Rumplestiltskin, and Gideon then spend many happy years together in another realm and when Belle becomes very old, she dies peacefully. Rumplestiltskin then begins searching for the Guardian so he can be free from the Darkness and reunite with Belle in the afterlife.

In his search for the Guardian, Rumplestiltskin goes to the Magical Forest and meets Alice, a Guardian. He brings her to Belle's coffin, where she begins destroying the Dark One's dagger with her magic, but Rumplestiltskin, not wanting her to absorb the Darkness, tackles her, restoring the Dagger and ruining his chance to reunite with Belle. A new Dark Curse is later cast and Rumplestiltskin is sent to Hyperion Heights. After his memories return and both Mother Gothel and Dr. Facilier are defeated, Rumplestiltskin travels to the Wish Realm where he takes out his own heart in order to save the dying Wish Realm Hook by giving it to him, which destroys the evil Rumplestiltskin from that realm. Rumplestiltskin then dies and is happily reunited with Belle in the afterlife.

Descendants
Belle in Descendants.
Belle appears in the Disney Channel Original Movie Descendants. She is played by Keegan Connor Tracy.

She and the Human Beast serve as the parents of the major character, Ben. Sometime after breaking the curse on her Prince, she and the Beast became the King and Queen of the idyllic kingdom of The United States of Auradon, one large kingdom uniting all the famous kingdoms, set in the present day, and inhabited by various iconic Disney characters and their children. When Ben, who is soon to be King, states he wants to grant the children of the Isle of the Lost a second chance as his first proclamation, she is understandably worried, but she remains supportive of her son's endeavors and pushes her husband to do so as well.

Beauty and the Beast (2017)
Emma Watson as Belle in the 2017 remake.
Belle appears in the 2017 live-action adaptation, played by Emma Watson. In this version, Belle isn't only a bookworm, but also an inventor - she uses her inventions for everyday chores such as laundry, which in turn provides her with time to catch up on her reading. Her backstory with Maurice is also expanded upon, as this version of the story confirms that the death of Belle's mother was the result of the black plague, forcing Maurice to take Belle (who was still an infant at the time) and flee Paris for safer havens towards the town of Villeneuve in the French countryside. As a result of his wife's passing, Maurice is somewhat overprotective of Belle and has reservations over her dreams of experiencing adventure within the outside world. As such, he created music boxes that represent different countries to allow her to "see the world" without actually having to leave their provincial town of Villeneuve. The fate of her mother (with her father's vague response on the former), left Belle puzzled and led her to seek out for answers; something that she would not discover for many years later, upon her time with the Beast, which he later showed her through a book given by the Enchantress as a means of traveling anywhere it desires, which she used it to transport them toward her childhood home in Paris and found out her mother's tragic fate, causing the Beast to realize his misjudgment of Maurice and made an apology to Belle for his earlier mistreatment to her father. The discovery of her mother's tragedy would be crucial for having Maurice and Belle making amends with each other, with Belle's widen understanding of why Maurice was so overly protective of her.

Belle is introduced in the opening of the film, singing the musical number named after her. While exploring the surrounding landscape, the people all seem to show interest in her. Encountering Gaston, he requests her to go on a date with him, to which Belle decides not to. Belle walks into her father Maurice in his workshop just as Maurice explains to Belle that the village is small, which is safer than larger villages and after a conversation between Belle and her father, Belle asks him for a rose like the one in his painting just as Maurice storms off to the marketplace to find a rose for her. As Maurice leaves, Belle returns to the village around her, teaching a nearby girl how to read, to which she then approaches Gaston again who tells her to give advice to the villagers, explaining to her that she would never marry him even though the village around Belle's world is small. After the conversation, Belle sings a reprise of the song named after her, longing for a great adventure in the world around her.

When Philippe arrives towards Belle, the horse is worried that he recently discovered something mysterious her father Maurice encountered, causing Belle to ride on him to get to the Beast's Castle. Arriving there, Belle encounters Lumiere and Cogsworth, who are commenting about Belle's plan to break the curse. Belle uses Lumiere as a torch to protect herself in order to find her father. Encountering Maurice, he warns her to escape before the Beast finds her. Belle then asks the Beast to find her father, to which the Beast denies her father's actions. Approaching the Beast, Belle spends a minute alone with the Beast, requesting him to see her father just as Belle notices the Beast taking her father away. Afterward, Lumiere escorts Belle to her room, who later introduces himself to Belle, just as Cogsworth approaches his conversation with Belle.

While exploring outside, Lumiere tells Belle that she can explore any part of the castle except for the west wing just as Belle is taken to her new room in the castle, to which it is known that the castle is now her new home just as Belle encounters Plumette, Madame De Garderobe, and Froufrou inside her new room as she encounters them in awe.

The Beast then requests Belle for a dinner invitation in the dining area, but she rejects his offer for locking her in the tower. She later gets an invitation from Mrs. Potts to go to the dining area, explaining that she would feel better after dinner just as Belle is told to go to dinner to which Belle is taken to the dining area where Lumiere and the other objects perform the musical number "Be Our Guest" in front of Belle, satisfying her.

After the musical number "Be Our Guest", Mrs. Potts talks to Belle, telling her that the Beast is willing to be set free by finding someone to fall in love with. After talking to Mrs. Potts, she tells her son to go to bed. Belle then looks at the damaged picture of the royal family's castle and arrives at the spot where the Enchanted Rose is at, only for the Beast to confront her as he angrily roars at her to get out of the castle. Belle then plans to leave, but Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and Froufrou try to stop Belle from leaving, but Belle leaves. Escaping, Belle rides on Philippe while a pack of wolves prepares to attack. The Beast then arrives and fights against the pack of wolves, shooing away the wolves. Belle comforts over the injured Beast as he is taken to the castle, where he is told to help her only if he controls his temper. While taking care of the Beast, Mrs. Potts tells Belle the Beast about his tragic loss of his mother and having to be raised by his abusive father just as the Beast calms himself while resting. Later after singing the musical number "Days in the Sun", Lumiere explains to Belle that if the last petal falls, the Prince will remain a Beast forever and the castle residents become inanimate objects.

With the Beast healed, he takes Belle to the library as she looks at the library around her in excitement. Later, Belle and the Beast walk outside together just as the couple looks at the frozen lake around them. Belle then teaches the Beast how to be gentle to Philippe and later sings the musical number "Something There" just as she and the Beast start a relationship with them. Later, Belle thanks the Beast for saving her from the wolves just as Belle talks to him about the villagers thinking Belle is funny. Back at the library, the Beast shows Belle a book from the Enchantress related to the curse she cast on her. Belle later takes the Beast into Paris, where she sings to him that her childhood in Paris is gone just as she remembers her tragic flashback about her mother who died from the plague just as the Beast apologizes to her for calling her a thief.

Belle wears a ball gown at the Beast's castle while the Beast wears a formal suit just as she and the Beast dance together during the musical number "Beauty and the Beast" as Mrs. Potts sings in front of the dancing couple.

Belle tells the Beast that her father taught her how to dance as the couple arrives at the balcony. Showing empathy to Belle, the Beast gives her the Enchanted Mirror to Belle help her find her father. Upon seeing Maurice being attacked by an angry mob, Belle is tasked to find her father and rescue her.

As Belle leaves the castle to find her father, Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and Plumette are worried about Belle planning to find her father just as they all leave sadly, as the Beast sings the musical number "Evermore". Belle walks across Gaston in front of Maurice who is being threatened just as Belle shows proof about the Beast to the townspeople. During this moment, Belle finds out that Gaston betrayed her about the Beast being a hideous monster as Gaston is aggressively planning to kill the Beast as Belle is locked into the carriage. Afterwards, Gaston sends an angry mob to kill the Beast. Belle and Maurice plan to escape the carriage in an attempt to warn the Beast that Gaston has sent in the mob to kill him. Belle then rides on Philippe to return to the castle.

Arriving back at the Castle, Belle notices Gaston hurting the Beast just as Gaston tries to finish his plan to kill the Beast. After the Beast reunites with Belle, she comforts him after being injured. Gaston, however, falls to his death while Belle tries to protect the Beast. Belle ends up crying over the Beast's motionless body as the last petal falls.

As the last petal falls, Agathe arrives at the spot where Belle cries over the Beast's dead body as Agathe uses her magic to restore the Enchanted Rose as the Beast is transformed back into his normal form, the Prince whom Belle manages to recognize as her beloved by looking into his eyes before sharing a kiss with him. With the spell broken and the castle fixed, the Prince and Belle dance in the ballroom with the other castle residents.

Printed media
The New Adventures of Beauty and the Beast
A younger Belle, as seen in The New Adventures of Beauty and the Beast.
This comic serial took place a few years before the events of the first film, with both stories being reprinted in Disney Princess Comics Treasury.

In the first issue, in a flashback during the first storyline, "Bewitched", Belle briefly witnessed the Prince being unkind to an old lady, resulting in her asking her father whether men are all monsters. In the second storyline, "Bothered", she learns from Maurice that their pet pig, Pierre, was an essential component to a truffle harvester before he tells her to put her King Arthur book away, so she can play outside with the other village children. Belle attempts to refuse, citing that she has more enjoyment imagining King Arthur's court. Ultimately, she did go out, resulting in her being reluctantly forced into becoming the "galley prisoner" by several boys playing pirates. She attempted to get out, only to find a bear (implied to actually be the Enchantress in disguise) snarling and about to attack her. She eventually was unintentionally rescued by Maurice with a test run with the Truffle Harvester. Belle later makes an appearance in the ending of the third storyline, "Bewildered", as a reflection on the enchanted mirror.

In the second issue's first storyline, "Elsewhere", she and Maurice were on their way back from the fair (not being allowed to participate after one of Maurice's inventions ripped the dress of one of the judge's wives). She eventually got curious about a path and went down it despite her father's insistence that she not go down that path. She managed to find an owl, which Maurice attempted to capture for one of his new ideas, although it disappeared despite capturing it. They then fled after finding a wolf nearby (both the wolf and the owl were implied to be the Enchantress in disguise). Belle noted she had a funny feeling she'll eventually go down that path in an act of foreshadowing.

Beauty and the Beast (Marvel Comics)
This comic serial took place during Belle's stay at Beast's castle, similar to the midquels above.

In the First Issue, while looking for the book Lost at Sea, she heard the Beast roaring (which nearly got an animated Ladder to drop her due to fright, also implying that this wasn't the first time Beast made a huge roar). Belle then spent her time reading the book until Chip and Mrs. Potts (after the former had to loudly interrupt her reading) informed her of Beast's rising temper and foul mood, which is nearly spoiling the planned surprise party for the Wardrobe. Belle then decided to tell Beast just what she thinks of him. After telling the Beast off, the latter admitted that he was in a foul mood because he had woken up from a dream about becoming handsome and discovering he was still ugly. Belle then assured him that it was the inside that counts, not the outside. Belle then offered to have Beast come down to aid with Wardrobe's surprise party, with Beast, after initially refusing, deciding to do so for Belle.

The second issue picks up right where the first issue left off. Belle tells him to be gracious, at least during the Wardrobe's surprise party when the Beast snaps for his dinner. During the actual dinner, however, Belle reacted with disgust when Beast ended up chowing down the meal like an animal. Sometime later, Belle thanked Lumiere for the soup and planned to have the rest of dinner by the fire, although after Beast snapped at her to stay at the table, she then sternly told Beast that she'll stay only if he eats with a utensil and not slurp the meal (which Beast did reluctantly). Belle then was horrified that Beast (who had second thoughts to attending the party anyway) demanded the party be canceled when he learned the Wardrobe wasn't coming down, and instead suggested that she go upstairs and try to convince Wardrobe to come down as the servants worked very hard for it. Belle then learned the Wardrobe wouldn't come down because she was depressed as, being a wardrobe, she viewed herself as useless as she had plenty of dresses and no one to wear them. She then offered to try on one of the dresses, and then deliberately left behind the tiara to lure the wardrobe downstairs for the surprise party. She then watched the opera.

The third issue occurs the morning after the party, Belle proceeded to go for a walk on the grounds, alone, despite the servant's suggestions that someone accompanies her. While walking on the grounds, Belle accidentally bumped into the Beast (who had secretly gone outside in an attempt to walk with her at the servants' suggestion), which ended up spoiling the event with them getting into a severe argument. Eventually, they made up and decided to play with the leaves and snow. Aside from this, one of the Bimbettes, Laurette, disguised herself as Belle in a wife auction organized by Gaston, fully anticipating that Gaston would want Belle. She then pretended that she fully submitted to what Gaston wanted in a wife, but then her disguise was spoiled by her sisters (not realizing that "Belle" was actually Laurette). Although Gaston was initially upset at this outcome, he eventually forgave it and figured Belle may have simply not been aware of what happened.

The fourth issue picks up right where the third issue's Belle story left off. Lumiere planned to have Belle and Beast attend the Glorious Harvest Gala Festival, even writing invitations for them. However, although Belle got her invitation, Beast's invitation ended up blown into the fire and burned. She later learned of this when Chip opened the window enough for Lumiere and Cogsworth's loud blame game to pierce her reading in an attempt to warn her of what happened (with Belle assuming that Beast threw the letter into the fire). She then told off the Beast for burning the letter and implied that she misjudged Beast, although she eventually learned that the reason why Beast did so was that he couldn't read the letter even if he wanted to, having long forgotten how to do so. Belle then offered to teach him to do so, and then attended with him the Gala Festival, having supper and then offering to have her look at the stars.

The fifth issue has Belle teaching Beast how to read. However, the difficulty ended up frustrating Beast to a huge extent, causing them to have a huge argument and resulting in Belle storming off. Belle then mentioned the complexity of the Beast's dual nature and commented that she wished that she was back at the village (then flashing back to the beginning of the film).

The sixth issue picks off where the fifth issue left off: Belle, after reading a book, comments it's great to have a library, so she could go off on adventures, even if it's her imagination and pities the Beast for keeping himself locked up in the castle and his mind, being too stubborn to let her teach him how to read. She then got a message from Lumiere from the Beast, although she eventually deduced that Lumiere actually composed the Beast's message for the Beast and not the Beast himself. She then thanked Beast for his thoughtfulness but would appreciate it more if Beast himself actually wrote the poem. Beast was reluctant since he wasn't a poet. Eventually, after Beast unconsciously began to do poetry, she then let Beast attempt to read when he requested it.

The seventh issue starts with a daydream by Belle about a time at the village where she helped Maurice fix up an egg-sorting contraption just as the latter was about to give up due to it failing and resulting in eggs splattering, citing her confidence in him. After successfully fixing it up, Maurice then notes that a dove was nearby, meaning that their lives will get better. She then is in her room, mentioning she misses him. Afterward, she agrees to play with Chip in the snow (as everyone else was too busy to do so with Chip). She then taught him how to build a snowman, and eventually decided with Chip to get holly bushes to help prepare for Christmas. Unfortunately, the blizzard unexpectedly gets worse, with Belle and Chip eventually getting lost in the forest and thus unable to return to the castle due to the severity of the storm.

The eighth issue picks up where the seventh issue left off. Belle, lost in the storm, offered to tell Chip a story about her past as a way to keep themselves awake and thus avoid freezing to death, although she eventually passes out. Luckily, the bushels managed to hit Beast as he was searching for her, resulting in him tracking down her location and saving her and Chip in time. She then learned Beast tended to her side and never moved, with her thanking him. Beast then thanked her for saving his life as she taught him that his life wasn't "meaningless" after all. In her flashback, Belle and Maurice, with their egg-sorting contraption, went out of the village to the fair. However, they eventually got themselves lost (due to the Bimbettes switching the sign to go the other way to deliberately get Belle off the course). They just barely managed to get to the fair (after Maurice deduced they were actually supposed to go South, not North), and also won as a last-minute entry. She then returned to the village with Maurice, with Gaston greeting them (to the Bimbettes' chagrin).

In the ninth issue, because of guilt for rarely saving her and Chip, Beast had her stay in bed and make breakfast in bed for her. However, this eventually proved unnecessary due to Belle having fully recovered and coming downstairs to thank Beast. Belle then offered to do something in return for Beast, with the servants planning to make a portrait of her. She changed her various outfits and eventually settled on a pink outfit, thanks to Beast's compliment earlier. However, during the painting process, she had a sad look that Beast and Chip noticed when the painting was unveiled (it's strongly implied her melancholy was due to homesickness, more specifically, her missing her father).

In the tenth issue, occurring the next day, Belle ended up playing in the snow with Chip (as she had promised to play with him in the snow again after a day passed), although while gazing at the sky, she saw a dove and began to feel sad for her father again. She then had a snowball fight with Chip, accidentally striking Beast (who was on his way to converse with Belle to figure out how he can make her feel better after getting the hint from the portrait earlier that she was melancholic) on the muzzle with a snowball. She apologized to Beast, and after a comment from Chip about getting Hollies, inadvertently supplied Beast with the idea to decorate the castle with lots of hollies to make her feel better. Belle then, after dinner, discovered Beast's decorations after Beast led her to them.

In the eleventh issue, set an unspecified time after the prior issue, Belle was reading with Beast in the library when she discovered it was a bit chilly, and eventually discovered the cause was because the door was ajar. However, she then discovered that because of the earlier snowstorm, her favorite book was ruined. Her devastation was made even worse when Beast obliviously insulted her book in an attempt to make her feel better, leaving without a word while crying to herself and also being unwilling to eat at dinner with the Beast. She also explained to the Wardrobe what the story was about, with the Wardrobe also explaining that before books, there were storytellers, with Belle acknowledging that nothing can take it away from her.

In the twelfth issue, picking up where the prior issue left off, Belle expressed some uncertainty about the Beast, especially given his inconsistent nature, and is struggling to understand him. Later, Belle finds the Beast arriving at the library, and he attempts to tell her something. However, before the Beast could begin to explain, the Wardrobe (who decided to make an opera thanks to what Belle told her earlier) basically started an opera in the library, causing Beast to skulk off. Belle then pursued him and tried to find out what he wanted to tell her, and he revealed he had repaired her favorite book and apologized for the earlier comment.

In the thirteenth and final issue, Belle helped prepare a cherry pie for dessert for a meal she and Beast were having, to thank him for repairing the book earlier. She later put it on the windowsill for it to cool off after it was done being baked. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to her, Sultan, while jumping in and out of the window while forced outside by the servants, ruined the dessert and proceeded to eat it up. Despite this and Beast and her learning the bad news, Beast wasn't the least bit upset, and in fact, was touched that Belle even made him dessert in the first place. As a result, she and the Beast shared a moment near the fireplace, with the servants witnessing it.

Besides the main comic serial, the fifth issue for the anthology series Disney Comic Hits! had her as a child sledding alongside Gaston and the Bimbettes, suggesting that she had initially been friends with Gaston and the Bimbettes prior to the events of the first film and that Belle may have moved to the village when she was very young (at least around Chip's age, according to her). She also ended up being given by Beast a sleigh ride as her Christmas present, with it being implied that Chip suggested the present to him.

Disney Adventures
Belle appeared in at least two stories for Disney Adventures magazine, both being in the Twelfth Volume:

In the first story, Time Flies! Belle informed an agitated Cogsworth that dinner was only a few hours away (as he was under the belief that dinner was actually supposed to happen by that point and the staff was late), and then discovered the cause at the wrong time: Cogsworth's wind up key was stolen as a prank (revealed to be by Lumiere). This story was later reprinted in Disney Princess Comics Treasury.

In the second story, Sittin' Pretty!, Belle made an appearance in the ending of the comic, where she was amused at the servants' attempts to give Beast a makeover, noting he looked ridiculous, as well as adorable, catching Beast off-guard. Beast also went through the makeover because he was ranting about how Belle can love him when he looks hideous.

Kilala Princess
Belle in Kilala Princess.
In the manga series Kilala Princess, the main characters Kilala, Prince Rei, and Princess Sylphy enter the world of "Beauty and the Beast" looking for magical gems to activate the Magic Tiara's power and awaken the princess within Kilala. When Belle first meets them, Kilala immediately asks to shake her hand. They become fast friends, and Belle asks the Beast to let them stay in the castle and work. Sylphy's egocentric attitude initially makes it unbearable for everyone, but it improves over time. When Cogsworth accidentally loses the pocket watch that the Beast planned to give to Belle, Kilala and Rei go into town to find it. Though they manage to retrieve the watch, in a broken condition, the amber stored inside is stolen by Gaston.

The Beast remains unaware of this incident, and when it breaks in his hand, he bursts out angrily and hides in his room. In order to cheer him up, Kilala, Rei, and Sylphy steal back the lost gem from Gaston. Kilala then tells him why he wanted to give Belle the watch in the first place, and that it doesn't matter if the gift is broken. Belle accepts the broken watch and gives the gem to Kilala as a token of gratitude, and turns into a gem of the Magic Tiara. She is last seen witnessing Kilala receive her own gem: an emerald.

The Beast Within: A Tale of Beauty's Prince
Belle appears in Serena Valentino's novel "The Beast Within" with a much-reduced role. She first appears at a ball thrown by the Prince, where he is drawn to her but is discouraged to do so by Gaston, who mentions that she is the daughter of a crazy inventor and that all she talks about is books. Inspired by this, the Prince then goes to a prettier girl named Tulip, whom he decides to marry. Later, she appears in events that are canon to the film, however, the wolves are sent by the sisters of the Enchantress, who desire to kill her so the Prince will remain a beast forever. However, in having the Beast save Belle, they inadvertently set into motion the events that lead to the Beast's redemption and his and Belle's happily ever after.

Disney Princess: Royal Weddings
In this book featuring the wedding between Belle and the Prince, Belle decided that, since the Prince had spent time unloved during the curse, she might also do something to show the Prince is indeed loved. She then secretly invited the village to the wedding. During the ceremony, she then received a book from the Prince, so they could "write their future adventures together".

Video games
Kingdom Hearts series
Belle is a character in the series and plays a pivotal role as one of the Princesses of Heart.

In the first Kingdom Hearts game, Belle was captured by Maleficent's forces while she was living with the Beast, and was placed into an enchanted sleep alongside the other Princesses at Maleficent's stronghold in Hollow Bastion while her world was consumed in darkness by the Heartless. Her heart was used to open the Final Keyhole, which would open the door to darkness itself, and briefly stolen as well by Ansem, Seeker of Darkness to craft his own dark Keyblade. This caused Beast, who survived the destruction of his world and followed Belle through sheer willpower, to have a vision of Belle being turned into a Pureblood Shadow Heartless, infuriating him and causing him to attack the Heartless, separating him from Sora as he faced Riku. However, Belle's heart is later restored when Sora pierces himself with Ansem's Keyblade to release Kairi's heart from his body, destroying Ansem's Keyblade and releasing the Princesses' hearts, and she is able to awaken (at which point she can be found not conversing with the other Princesses in the Castle Chapel, but rather in Maleficent's library), and finally, reunites with the Beast. As thanks for helping her and the Beast, Belle grants Sora the Divine Rose Keychain for his Keyblade to use in his battles. After Sora seals Kingdom Hearts, Belle and the Beast are able to return home.

An illusion of Belle also appeared in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, who acts cold towards the Beast in order to prevent Maleficent from stealing her heart. After the villain's defeat, she apologizes for deceiving the Beast, which the Beast forgives.

The real Belle appears in 358/2 Days alongside Beast in Beast's Castle, where their peace was threatened by Xaldin, who intended to take the Beast's heart.
