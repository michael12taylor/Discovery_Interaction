<html><p>Back at the Beast's Castle, the Beast wears a formal suit while Belle wears a ball gown just as she and the Beast dance together during the musical number "Beauty and the Beast" as Mrs. Potts sings in front of the dancing couple.

As the couple arrives at the balcony, Belle tells the Beast that her father taught her how to dance. Showing empathy to Belle, the Beast gives her the Enchanted Mirror to Belle to help find her father. Upon seeing Maurice being attacked by an angry mob, Belle is tasked to go find her father and rescue her. As Belle leaves the castle to find her father, Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and Plumette are worried about Belle planning to find her father just as they all leave sadly, as the Beast sings the musical number "Evermore".

Later, Belle talks to Gaston and shows him the Enchanted Mirror with an image of the Beast on it. Upon seeing this, Gaston tells the villagers that the Beast will kill everyone as a hideous creature and Belle finds out that she betrayed her for calling her love interest a monster just as Belle is locked into the carriage. Later, Gaston sends an angry mob to kill the Beast as Gaston and the angry mob approach the castle to kill the Beast. During battle against Gaston, the Beast is injured by Gaston who fires a pistol on him just as Belle tries to protect him from Gaston. Later as the Beast sees Belle and the Beast reunites with her, Gaston attacks again, injuring the Beast severely just as Gaston falls to his death. Belle then cries over the Beast's motionless body just as the last petal falls.

As the last petal falls, Agathe arrives to the spot where Belle cries over the Beast's dead body as Agathe uses her magic to restore the Enchanted Rose as the Beast is transformed back into his normal form, the Prince. With the spell broken and the castle fixed, the Prince and Belle start a relationship again and dance in the ballroom with the other residents of the castle.

The New Adventures of Beauty and the Beast
This two-part comic series released by Disney Comics took place a few years prior to the first film. He appears in two of the three-story arcs of the first issue. In the first arc, "Bewitched", he is roaring in an apparent tantrum, scaring the other staff members. Eventually, they arrive at his quarters, and Beast merely asks them where his Music Box was, with Mrs. Potts telling him that it was likely in the library, with it being revealed that his tantrum from earlier was due to being unable to nap from not finding the music box. The story proper also covered Beast's backstory, which Mrs. Potts relayed to Chip. Specifically: He was shown as a child to be very bratty, and got irritated when an apparent old crone stopped traffic, resulting in his hitting her and Lumiere and Cogsworth scolding him before attempting to apologize by the then-long disappeared woman (who had secretly turned into a crow and flew off). The prince later noted that she was most likely a witch (it would later turn out he was right in more ways than one). It later showed the time he was on a hunting trip and was about to target a fawn, despite Lumiere's suggestions against it, although a crow (strongly implied to be the Enchantress in disguise) managed to interfere with the shot. They then covered some positives to the prince, namely, he was kind to Chip as a toddler, and he was a gifted learner and scholar. In the third arc, Bewildered, the Beast had learned to be educated in an attempt to become nicer at the behest of his servants, which included trying to read poetry (despite Beast insisting that the curse robbed him of his ability to read any books, let alone poetry). Fifi (identified as Marie in this comic) and Lumiere also attempted to give dating advice to the Beast, although it didn't work due to his accidentally shredding the pages, resulting in Beast accidentally destroying his cherished toy, the music box, during one of his rages.

In the second issue, he appeared in both story arcs. In "Elsewhere", he appeared very briefly in the end when panning away from Maurice and Belle returning to their village. In "Elsewhen", starting where Elsewhere left off, the Beast, having clearly given up hope of ever becoming human again (with it is implied that the rose had just started to wilt), decided to try living in the wild, although this resulted in his falling off a cliff and being knocked out, with Chip and Sultan discovering the Beast's unconscious body during a thunderstorm due to his absence. He was ultimately saved by the servants after Chip had Sultan warn them of the Beast's current status, eventually lashing out against his servants, although he managed to save Chip from being destroyed when he revealed he was the one who saved the Beast's life, also sleeping with Chip on his hand. In both stories, there was foreshadowing of the events of the film.

Beauty and the Beast (Marvel Comics)
This 13-issue series of comics, similar to the midquels, took place sometime between Belle's imprisonment at his castle (presumably right after Beast gave Belle the library) and the curse being lifted in the original film.

The Beast and Belle on the cover of Issue #1 of the Marvel Comics series.
In the first issue, he had a dream where Belle restored him to his original form but ended up enraged upon seeing he is still a monster upon waking up, resulting in him causing an uproar that was scaring the other servants (who already were having a hard time preparing for the wardrobe's surprise birthday party). After being confronted by Belle regarding the Beast's recent behavior, he admitted his rage was due to the nightmare he experienced upon waking up. He then agreed to hold the surprise party, albeit reluctantly.

In the second issue, he ended up becoming impatient due to the wardrobe taking too long. He eventually chowed down on a meal (albeit in an animalistic fashion), and eventually nearly canceled the party due to the wardrobe not arriving. However, they eventually managed to get the party underway after Belle agreed to try out one of her dresses to make her feel better (as she was upset that she, a former opera star, was forced by the spell into becoming a wardrobe and thus be less than useful). Beast ended up participating in the resulting festivities but left due to the feeling that Belle will never love him, largely because of his appearance.

In the third issue, the Beast, as a suggestion by some of the servants, decided to accompany Belle on a walk on the Castle grounds. Because of the Beast's skulking around, however, this resulted in disaster due to them arguing. After making up, they then continued with their walk. The fourth issue continued with this, where Lumiere ended up overestimating it with this action and sent letters to the Beast and Belle for the Grand Harvest Festival. However, the Beast, because he no longer knew how to read thanks to the curse, burned the letter, which resulted in another near-disaster. Belle eventually confronted him on this (having overheard Lumiere and Cogsworth's argument about the former's botching of the event due to Chip opening the window for Belle to hear while she was reading). The Beast eventually decided to admit on the advice of his staff to Belle that he could not read the letter, with her promising to teach him.

In the fifth issue, the Beast, true to his word, attempted to learn how to read, but he ended up getting frustrated at his lack of progress, causing Belle to think she may have misjudged him. The Beast realized he may have messed up, and believed her to have been the object of many men's desires at her village and thus further fueling his self-loathing and doubts. Lumiere then offered to have the Beast compose a poem. However, the Beast got the wrong idea and had him finish it under his name after giving a few inputs to the letter. Belle eventually saw through this and attempted to have him learn to read and write by himself in the next issue.

In the seventh issue, the Beast witnessed Belle and Chip playing in the snow, wishing he could be out there with them. In the eighth issue, after demanding to know the commotion behind the servant's panic, learned that Belle and Chip got lost in the blizzard. He then consulted his magic mirror to locate Belle near the snowman that Belle and Chip had created earlier and immediately rushed out to find them. Unfortunately, the blizzard was becoming extremely thick that he couldn't find them. He eventually managed to find them when Belle's bouquet of Holly bushels was blown towards him. After locating them both, he managed to get them back into the castle and tended to her side. He then thanked her for saving his life, as because of her, he began realizing his own life was not "meaningless" after all. In the ninth issue, the Beast felt a lot of guilt for Belle and Chip nearly being killed in the snowstorm. He also had breakfast served to Belle in bed, although her recovery and meeting the Beast downstairs made this unnecessary. Eventually, after Lumiere and Cogsworth arranged for Belle to have a portrait done for her, the Beast managed to find it after they unveiled it. Although impressed, he initially guessed that she was sad before correcting himself and saying she was pensive (although Chip's later comment about the painting implies that "sad" was, in fact, the true emotion Belle was expressing in the painting).

The tenth issue takes place the day afterward, with the Beast briefly roaring. Beast almost shuts Cogsworth and Lumiere out, although because Lumiere persisted, he explained his problem: Despite his second analysis, he realized Belle was indeed sad in the painting and was caught in a conflict of how to make her happy. He then at Lumiere's suggestion decided to go outside to converse with Belle, which he did after a delay where Belle accidentally hit the Beast in the snout with a snowball. However, upon hearing Belle express a desire to find hollies, he left to try to locate holly bushes in the forest and managed to decorate the castle with them. The Beast then, after dinner, showed Belle the bushels inside the castle.

In the eleventh issue, set some time afterward the Beast and Belle were reading in the library again. When Belle felt chilly, the Beast removed his cloak in an attempt to keep her warm, although Belle moved out of the way when she discovered the cause was from the window being ajar. When Belle was devastated that her favorite book was ruined, Beast attempted to cheer her up by stating that there were thousands of other books, also unintentionally and obliviously hurting her feelings when telling her it was a "silly book." The Beast eventually realized his error when Belle did not come down for dinner, and his servants told him about her being hurt by his earlier comment. He also decided (from Chip's suggestion) to have the book fixed.

In the twelfth issue, taking place where the eleventh issue left off, as a result of guilt from his earlier insensitivity towards the ruining of Belle's favorite book due to a storm, Beast attempted to have the book rebound immediately, as well as trying to rehearse, to his own discomfort, how to deliver the book. Taking Mrs. Potts' advice regarding being himself once the book was rebounded, he then attempted to surprise Belle with the book, but he ended up dissuaded after the Wardrobe gave an opera performance before he could even give the book to her, feeling the majestic performance outclassed his attempt at fixing the book. However, when Belle came to see him and he explained what happened, he then gave her the book.

In the final issue, the Beast reflected on how things might have turned out differently had he let the old woman in. He eventually snapped when the footstool dog escaped and attempted to enter the West Wing due to disturbing him, causing even Mrs. Potts to have doubts about whether the Beast can ever break the curse. He eventually came down to dinner and had a meal with Belle. However, the planned dessert ended up ruined by the footstool dog who kept jumping out and back in. Despite this, he was touched that Belle made the dessert and wasn't upset about it being ruined. They then shared a moment near the fire. In addition, a flashback was shown giving hints to the Beast's childhood prior to the curse. His parents spoiled him immensely, and they even threw an extravagant party, yet he ended up bored by it. In addition, he formerly had an Arabian horse named "Thunder", whom he frequently rode yet never gave him any love and compassion. When about to ride him one instance, the horse fled, with the prince ordering everyone to retrieve it. Deep down, he missed the horse and presumably felt remorse for his treatment of it. Thunder eventually was adopted by an enchantress who gave it love.

Aside from the main serial, Issue 5 of Disney Comic Hits had the Beast eventually supplying Belle with a carriage as a present during the winter as a suggestion from Chip, after he had initially had an angry outburst to Belle.

Disney Adventures comics
Some issues of Disney Adventures Magazine included comic stories for the film, either reprint of the Marvel series or entirely new stories to tie into new releases of the film.

Although he doesn't appear in the story "Time Flies!", he is mentioned by Cogsworth, as he panicked at the possibility of the Beast entering a rage due to the preparations for dinner apparently being late (unaware that it was actually only a few hours away and it was at the wrong time due to Lumiere stealing his winder as a prank).

The Beast has a direct appearance in the story "Sittin' Pretty!". In it, Beast is going through one of his rages again, particularly how he can get Belle to love him due to his hideous appearance. Lumiere then gets the idea of giving the Beast a spa makeover, with Cogsworth, Chip, and Fifi chiming in. Eventually, Belle comes in and notices that Beast looks ridiculous, as well as adorable, catching Beast off-guard.

In one story, the Beast ended up becoming bitter even more than usual, although he later worked with Belle and the others to save Chip after he got lost in the forest during a blizzard. The story also implied that, prior to Belle, there was a blonde woman he was betrothed to, but she had disappeared, eventually resulting in his bitterness.

Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Royal Wedding
In the short story following the events of the film, Belle and the Prince prepare for their upcoming nuptials. Belle is fitted for her wedding dress while the Prince returns to Belle's village to get her the perfect gift for the wedding. After searching around, the Prince finds a flower shop and requests for roses, as they were Belle's favorite.

Eventually, the wedding day arrives for the young couple. During the ceremony, the Prince proceeded to give Belle a book as his gift, so they could "write their adventures together." Belle then reveals her surprise: she invited all the villagers to the wedding. Because the Prince spent most of his life unloved, Belle wanted to show the Prince how loved he is by the kingdom. The Prince loves the gift, and the two embrace as the festivities commence.

The Beast Within: A Tale of Beauty's Prince
The Beast appears in the novel as the main character, written by Serena Valentino. On that note, he's the only major character thus far in Serena Valentino to not be a Disney Villain beforehand (not counting the Odd Sisters). Detailing the Beast's past when he was a prince, it is explained that he used to be good friends with Gaston and was beloved by the court and villagers. However, when he discovered that a woman named Circe (whom he was betrothed to) was, in reality, a farmer, he was quick to reject her despite being at first smitten by her looks. When she returns disguised as a beggar woman, the Prince showed no mercy towards her wish to forgive him, and so she and her three sisters cursed him with the spell that would turn him into a monster. Soon, the Prince's fear gets the better of him, and he decides to marry a princess named Tulip in hopes of loving her. Unfortunately, as the castle begins to endure more phenomena, he becomes infuriated and throws Tulip out when he believes she has deceived him into thinking she loved him. Eventually, his transformation finishes, and with it the dissipation of memories of his past life as he slowly descends into an animalistic mindset. When he does meet Belle, however, he comes to love her. The sisters attempt to prevent the Beast from breaking the spell by manipulating the arrival of Gaston and the mob, and nearly the Beast's death. However, Circe brings the Beast to life and restores him to human form, allowing the Prince to live happily with Belle.

As Old as Time (A Twisted Tale)
In this new interpretation of the tale, further information is provided on the Beast's past, as well as events changing after Belle accidentally makes contact with the rose before the Beast can drive her away. With the curse disrupted, Belle realizes that the Enchantress that cursed the Beast was her own mother, and her subsequent efforts to help the Beast research what drove her mother to cast the curse include such discoveries as the dead body of his former favorite servant, Alaric Potts, the former stable-master and Mrs. Potts' husband. When Belle is captured by Monsieur D'Arque as part of his own campaign against magic, the Beast is forced to appeal to Gaston and the villagers for help, nearly regressing to a feral level himself as the curse reaches a point where the servants are reduced to mere objects. However, after D'Arque is killed by Gaston, Belle is able to rescue her mother, while her presence and affection help the Beast regain his human mind, but the Enchantress is so weakened by D'Arque's attempts to 'cure' her of magic that she is only able to either restore the Beast to humanity or restore his servants. With this in mind, the Beast requests that she restore his servants, allowing himself to remain in his current state, but deciding to gather other magic-users into his restored kingdom while working on a solution to his own transformation.

Video games
Roar of the Beast
In this game, the Beast must travel through different levels (based on locations from the film) to rescue Belle from the villainous Gaston, and prevent the villagers from attacking his castle.

Beauty and the Beast: A Board Game Adventure
The game was basically the plot of the original film adapted into a video board game, although it was mostly based on the ending of the film. In addition, Beast also makes a brief appearance in the commercial for the game, where he pops up from behind the Game Boy Color and yells at Lumiere and Mrs. Potts to shut up after the latter two entered an argument due to Lumiere causing things to set on fire due to his wild movements while presenting the game. Robby Benson reprised the role in this brief appearance.

Kingdom Hearts series
The Beast is a recurring character in the Kingdom Hearts series. He plays a major role in Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II as an ally to Sora and his friends.

His story prior to Kingdom Hearts is basically the same as in the movie. During the time he and Belle were getting to know each other, Belle was captured by the Heartless, and the Beast's world, along with all of his servants, was swallowed by the darkness. In a rare occurrence of most Disney characters in the game, Beast appeared outside of his homeworld due to its demise, but was able to escape to Hollow Bastion because of his love for Belle, allowing him to pursue her kidnappers there through sheer willpower. However, he is confronted by Riku when he learns that Belle is within the castle Maleficent has made her home base, and is harmed by the boy when he demands her return to him and tries to fight past Riku to gain entrance to the castle when Riku calls his bluff and taunts him. The Beast then finds an ally in Sora and aids him and his friends with fighting the Heartless and Maleficent. When the Princesses of Heart, including Belle, finally awaken, the Beast happily reunites with her. After Sora's victory over the darkness, Beast and Belle are able to return to their restored home.

The Beast appears in a minor role in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories as an illusion of the real Beast, crafted from Sora's memories of him. Like before, he tries to rescue Belle but is cruelly rejected by her (although she was only pretending in order to fool Maleficent). Despite this, the Beast states his own feelings for her, which moves Belle to sacrifice her own heart to save his when Maleficent tries to steal it. Maleficent's defeat restores Belle's heart, and the two reconcile.

In 358/2 Days, the Beast makes an appearance back in his homeworld but is met with constant attacks from the Heartless, forcing him to keep fighting them which places stress between him and Belle. He finally stops when he realizes that his servants and Belle are safe. However, the Beast is contacted by Xaldin of Organization XIII soon after, who begins to turn the Beast against Belle in a plot to turn him into a Heartless with his Nobody as a weapon for the Organization.

Continuing into Kingdom Hearts II, Xaldin had nearly completed his plan, while the Beast had grown aggressive towards both his staff and Belle. The return of Sora, Donald and Goofy manage to bring the Beast back to his senses and decides to help his friends confront Xaldin after learning that the Organization member was using him for their own intentions. After Xaldin escapes, the Beast tries to fix things with Belle, leading to where they attempt to have a dance in the castle ballroom before it is interrupted by Xaldin. Things take a turn for the worse when Xaldin steals the enchanted rose, sending the Beast into despair. The Beast tells Sora and the others to leave the castle, believing he will never be able to break the curse, but Sora convinces him to fight back, giving Beast the courage to reclaim the rose from Xaldin. However, Belle is kidnapped by Xaldin with the rose, with Xaldin forcing the Beast to choose between her and the rose. Although the Beast chooses Belle, Belle takes action and escapes from Xaldin, taking the rose with her. The group is able to defeat Xaldin, where afterward Beast asks Belle to stay with him, which she accepts, much to the Beast's joy. At the end of the game, the Beast appears to have turned back into a human, indicating that the curse was broken.

Kinect Disneyland Adventures
The Beast appears as a meet-and-greet character near the Matterhorn in Fantasyland. One of the tasks that the Beast gives to the player, give or take having finished Belle's tasks first, is to find lost pages for one of Belle's books. Right after, the Beast asks the player to find red crystals so he can create a crystal rose and place it on the cover of Belle's book as a gift. Once the book is prepared, the Beast becomes nervous pondering on the possibility of her not liking her gift, so he asks the player to take it to her instead.

Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion
The Beast is among the "still popular" Toons that gets captured and pulled into Wasteland by Mizrabel. He is the first toon Mickey manages to rescue.

Musical
Terrence Mann as Beast in the stage musical.
In the stage adaptation of the film, the Beast's role in the story, in addition to his character development, is expanded considerably. The role was originated by Terrence Mann, while the final performances of the Beast were portrayed by Steve Blanchard. The stage version, at the start, portrays the Beast as more physically abusive and mentally unsettled.

Unlike the film, where the singing performance of Beast was only utilized during "Something There", several new songs were written for the Beast, including "How Long Must This Go On?", where the Beast reflects his mistake in turning away the Enchantress and his longing for forgiveness. In "If I Can't Love Her", the Beast contemplates his decaying humanity and the hardships of the curse that befell the castle. This was driven out of physically harming Belle prior, though he admitted harm was not his intention, revealing the curse has begun overtaking his physical actions. He is also given a reprise of this song, shortly after releasing Belle from the castle.

Like the film, Beast and Belle are shown to bond through books, though the stage version elaborates on this further. After being read a book aloud, Beast discovers the power of literature, and how it can take him to a world of fantasy, and be used as an escape from the pressures and despair of his cursed life—something to which Belle openly relates.

Disney Parks
Beast, posing for a photo at one of the Disney parks.
The Beast appears in the Disney Parks as a meetable character in both his beast and human forms. Also, his likeness is commonly featured throughout the theme parks as well, specifically in the Magic Kingdom's Fantasyland, which, notably, features his castle.

Disneyland Resort
In California, the Beast can be seen throughout the original version of World of Color.

For meet-and-greets, he can sometimes be found at the Disneyland Hotel.

Walt Disney World
The Beast can be seen alongside Belle during the Festival of Fantasy Parade at the Magic Kingdom.

In Disney's Hollywood Studios, he can be spotted during Fantasmic!, and stars in the Beauty and the Beast live stage show.

For meet-and-greets, the Beast is usually only found at the Be Our Guest Restaurant at dinnertime and during special events but occasionally appears at the France Pavilion in Epcot.

Tokyo Disney Resort
Beast is prominently featured during the Once Upon a Time castle show at Tokyo Disneyland. He also appears, nightly, in the Beauty and the Beast unit of Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade: DreamLights.

Disneyland Paris
In Park (Paris), he dances with Belle and other princes and princesses at The Starlit Princess Waltz.

In Walt Disney Studios Park, during Lumiere's segment of Mickey and the Magician, Beast and Belle are introduced after the candelabra's performance of "Be Our Guest", where they share a ballroom dance to "Beauty and the Beast".

Hong Kong Disneyland
In Hong Kong, Beast appears in The Golden Mickeys. He also makes a brief appearance during the finale of Mickey and the Wondrous Book.

Shanghai Disneyland
In Shanghai, Beast is featured on the Beauty and the Beast display in Voyage to the Crystal Grotto. There is also a statue inside the Shanghai Disneyland Hotel depicting Beast and Belle ballroom dancing.

Differences from the source material
While the Beast keeps much of his original character continuity from the French fairy tale version by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont, there are quite a few differences to be accounted for:

The Beast's curse had no time limit in the original version and only required that he learn to love and gain a woman's love in return to break the spell. In addition, in the original tale, Beast alone was cursed, not anyone else, and also took care of his property by himself.
The Beast's confrontation with Belle's father was a lot tamer in the original version, simply telling her dad to trade his daughter for his life. In addition, in the original version, Maurice had pilfered a rose from Beast's garden as a gift for Beauty after being perplexed at thinking he had taken refuge at a deserted castle with no one inside, yet found a breakfast waiting for him. When he attempted to take the rose did Beast reveal himself, angry at Maurice's attempted theft when he had tried to be a good host. Maurice's imprisonment for attempting to steal one of the Beast's roses in the original story was restored in the live-action remake.
The rose had no direct link to the curse in the original version.
Originally, the Beast permitted Belle to leave under a time limit to visit her family instead of actually freeing her to save her dad.
Beast's death was not caused by a rival suitor knifing him in the back, but from a broken heart from Belle being late in returning due to her wicked sisters manipulating her into staying past the deadline.
As noted above, the Beast's personality was, while somewhat gruff, also more kind and simple to begin with.
Several of these actually were included in the Original Screenplay but ended up cut due to Jeffrey Katzenberg demanding a rewrite.

Trivia
The screenshot from The D Show showing the Beast's real name is Adam.
It has been stated in the directors' commentary included in the Beauty and the Beast DVD/Blu-ray that the writers and producers were so busy during production that they forgot to give the character an actual name; he is only referred to as "The Beast" or "the Prince". Keane admitted that the Beast never had an alternative name prior to the film's events. Despite that, his real name has been introduced in products licensed by Disney (such as the 1998 video game The D Show which was developed by Cyberflix and released by Disney Interactive) which explicitly use Adam as the Prince's name.
Since then, Disney has run with the name Adam, releasing licensed Disney Princess merchandise items as well as clearly labeling his portrait that adorns the walls of the Royal Rooms in Port Orleans Riverside at the Walt Disney World resort as Prince Adam
In the eleventh episode of the Season 2 of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series he is referred to as Prince Adam by the cast of the series.
Paige O'Hara, the voice actress to Belle, recently confirmed during a fan Q&A while adding "Disney will always deny it." that some animators and crew members did refer to The Prince as 'Adam' during production.
Dan Stevens, the actor who portrayed the Beast in the live-action movie, also used Prince Adam as the Beast's name during an interview.    Prince Adam in the portrait at Port Orleans Riverside in Walt Disney World  
According to the standalone US Weekly issue Secrets From the World of Disney: From Mickey to the Magic Kingdom!, Adam was the Beast's real name.
There seems to be Biblical inspiration for giving the name as "Adam": According to Glen Keane in a bonus featurette on the Diamond Edition Blu-ray of Beauty and the Beast, when animating the Beast's transformation sequence back to his (now-adult) human form, Glen Keane kept a quote from the Bible with him, from 2 Corinthians 5:17: "If any man is in Christ, he is a new creation: The old things has passed away, and all things have become new!", stating how his time working on the film had been a nigh-religious experience for him.

Even though he is referred to as a prince in the opening, none of the characters directly refer to him by that title. In addition, the first draft for Woolverton's take of the film indicated that the Beast was intended to be a duke instead of a prince.
According to the first stained-glass window featured in the film's opening sequence, the Prince's family motto is "vincit qui se vincit" (meaning "The winner is who wins himself"), which is rather ironic, seeing as the Prince/Beast, who comes from this family, is a character who needs to learn to master himself and learn self-restraint.
Although the Beast and Belle are technically co-protagonists of the film, various members of the production staff, including Howard Ashman, considered Beast the protagonist.
The Beast is the first male character in a Disney fairy tale to have a role that is equally significant as the female protagonist's.
Some of the sculptures seen in the castle are early concept versions of the Beast.
The Beast's human form in the merchandise has him only wearing his ballroom attire, only his brown dress boots are replaced with light blue socks and a traditional brown dress shoes.
Though the Beast's official age is not mentioned in the movie, it is strongly indicated by the narrator's statement that the rose "would bloom until his 21st year." As the rose has already begun to wilt by the time Belle arrives at the castle, it is very likely that the Beast is 20 years (i.e. on their 21st year) of age by this point. This has been confirmed by Glen Keane, and also in the filmmakers commentary for the extended edition, where it is specifically stated that the Beast's/Prince's 21st birthday would occur at some point after the enchanted rose has lost all of its petals and the curse had either been broken or else become permanent.
During the song "Be Our Guest" Lumiere states "for ten years, we've been rusting", implying the spell that had changed them all had been active for that amount of time. This, along with the statement the rose would wither by the Beast's 21st birthday, would imply he was cursed at age 11.
When looking at his shredded portrait in the West Wing, however, as well as his appearance in the flashback the sequel, he was likely closer to the age of a teenager when the Enchantress appeared at his door, and ten years was possibly a metaphor for how they never have company, not an actual statement of how long the curse has been active.
On the other hand, his depiction in the portrait was not an uncommon case: portraits of King Edward Tudor (Edward VI) depict him as looking 18 years of age when in reality, he was 13 years of age when it was painted, this was the case of children who were the reigning monarchs of their country.
Moreover, the Prince's flashback appearance in the sequel appearing to look like a teenager is simply down to the way that he was animated. Several other Disney preteens such as Melody, Peter Pan, Taran, and Alex all appear to be older than the age they actually are.
In the original screenplay of the movie written by Linda Woolverton, the prologue mentions that the Prince was 11 years of age when he was cursed and that the curse was active for ten years. The screenplay also mentions that the Prince was the reigning monarch of the kingdom he lived in and that Lumiere and Cogsworth (unnamed at that point) were his regents. Because this was an early draft, it is unknown if this was carried to the final product.
Some materials have also supported this statement, such as the mobile game Disney Magic Kingdoms explicitly stating the curse was active for ten years. It is unknown whether this holds true to the original or only to the game's continuity.
In authorized supplementary comics, most notably The New Adventures of Beauty and the Beast, the Prince is never shown as being older than a preteen when he's shown as a human; moreover, the palace staff all refer to his pre-curse self as "a young boy" or "child". Two individual comics show that the Prince was originally a few years older than Chip, who didn't age during the curse, and shows him as being a couple of years older than Belle herself. The comics also show that the Prince has had a few run-ins with the disguised Enchantress, meaning that he'd still be a preteen when he was cursed.
Perhaps to avoid this implication, the Broadway musical instead states that the rose "would bloom for many years".
In the Descendants universe, Belle hinted Beast had married her at the age of 28 when commenting on when he made a good decision as their son is being crowned King at the age of 16. This suggests that in this continuity, Beauty and the Beast took place seven years before Descendants or Beast met Belle at a different age.
During the song "Be Our Guest" Lumiere states "for ten years, we've been rusting", implying the spell that had changed them all had been active for that amount of time. This, along with the statement the rose would wither by the Beast's 21st birthday, would imply he was cursed at age 11.
When looking at his shredded portrait in the West Wing, however, as well as his appearance in the flashback the sequel, he was likely closer to the age of a teenager when the Enchantress appeared at his door, and ten years was possibly a metaphor for how they never have company, not an actual statement of how long the curse has been active.
On the other hand, his depiction in the portrait was not an uncommon case: portraits of King Edward Tudor (Edward VI) depict him as looking 18 years of age when in reality, he was 13 years of age when it was painted, this was the case of children who were the reigning monarchs of their country.
Moreover, the Prince's flashback appearance in the sequel appearing to look like a teenager is simply down to the way that he was animated. Several other Disney preteens such as Melody, Peter Pan, Taran, and Alex all appear to be older than the age they actually are.

In the original screenplay of the movie written by Linda Woolverton, the prologue mentions that the Prince was 11 years of age when he was cursed and that the curse was active for ten years. The screenplay also mentions that the Prince was the reigning monarch of the kingdom he lived in and that Lumiere and Cogsworth (unnamed at that point) were his regents. Because this was an early draft, it is unknown if this was carried to the final product.
Some materials have also supported this statement, such as the mobile game Disney Magic Kingdoms explicitly stating the curse was active for ten years. It is unknown whether this holds true to the original or only to the game's continuity.
In authorized supplementary comics, most notably The New Adventures of Beauty and the Beast, the Prince is never shown as being older than a preteen when he's shown as a human; moreover, the palace staff all refer to his pre-curse self as "a young boy" or "child". Two individual comics show that the Prince was originally a few years older than Chip, who didn't age during the curse, and shows him as being a couple of years older than Belle herself. The comics also show that the Prince has had a few run-ins with the disguised Enchantress, meaning that he'd still be a preteen when he was cursed.
Perhaps to avoid this implication, the Broadway musical instead states that the rose "would bloom for many years".

The Beast is the first male protagonist to not "save" his female counterpart near the film's climax. He does, however, save Belle from a vicious wolf attack roughly at the film's turning point.
The casting of the Beast was a true challenge, considering the fact the directors were searching for someone who could alternate between a deep, gruff, and rather uninviting voice to a soft, prince-like tone. When Robby Benson surprisingly auditioned for the role, the casting directors were both shocked and pleased, and immediately cast him. Critics claim Benson did the role so well that they couldn't even tell it was him.
In order to achieve the gruff Beast-like quality in the character's voice, Robby Benson's voice recordings were mixed with the growls of those of lions, tigers, panthers, and bears.

Several animals were studied and observed during the process of animating the Beast, such as wildebeests, bears, lions, and wolves.
During the fight with Gaston, the Beast says only two words to him: "Get out."
In the 2017 remake, Beast only says to Gaston: "I am not a beast", "Go", and "Get out".

One of the concept artworks for the Beast bore a large resemblance to the character of the same name from the X-Men series from Marvel Comics. Coincidentally, both characters are now owned by Disney, which acquired Marvel in 2009.
Ironically, one of the "Beautiful & Beastly Mail" correspondences in the second issue of the Beauty and the Beast Marvel Comics actually requested for a crossover between the two beasts, with Barbara Slate stating that, while one isn't in the works, if they do have one, expect "fur to fly."

The Beast is one of Disney's most unpredictable characters because at first glance he's a fierce monster but behind the intimidating face is a loving heart, which he displays toward Belle at the end of the film.
Before his change of heart, Beast wears mostly a purple cape, which is a combination of Gaston's trademark red (his antagonistic behavior) and Belle's blue (his true kind nature).
As mentioned above, because the viewers of the film grew more attached to the character's beastly form, most merchandising featuring the Beast tries to aim for the use of this form, not his human form. This is also why Beast's human form rarely ever appears as a Meet-and-Greet Character at the Disney Parks, as most patrons prefer to interact with the Beast.
Glen Keane went to the Los Angeles Zoo to study animals for the Beast's looks and personality. When he studied a six-hundred-pound antisocial gorilla, Caesar, and tried to draw him, Caesar charged at him and slammed against the bars. Keane knew this was how Belle would feel when she first caught sight of the Beast.
In the movie Enchanted, Robert Philip wears a suit very similar to the Beast's during the ball scene.
When the Beast is getting his hair cut for Belle, the hairstyle he is given is the same as the Cowardly Lion's from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz.
One of the considered voice actors for the Beast during development was Laurence Fishburne.
Other than the opening prologue to the story, the Beast was never actually identified as a prince during the events of the first film.
Originally, when he was planning dinner, the Beast was to bring in a carcass of a slain deer and explicitly chow down on it in front of Belle in a more animalistic manner. However, the scene ended up deleted because the writers realized such a scene would actually have the audience view the Beast with disgust instead of sympathy. Nonetheless, the Beast hunting for his food in a more animalistic manner is still implied in the film with the presence of a rotting rib-cage being seen briefly in the West Wing.
In the Special Edition of the film, because of the addition of "Human Again", the scene where Beast roars in despair at having to let Belle go was slightly altered to include glass shattering to imply that Beast, while still filled with despair at having to do this, ended up smashing the then-recently restored West Wing in order to have the song connect better with the main film where it was still tarnished during the climax.
According to Alan Menken, in the 2017 adaptation, one of the new songs written for the film "Evermore", sung by the Beast after he lets Belle go, is a love song to effectively takes the place of the reprise of "If I Can't Love Her" from the musical.
The Beast's death scene originally had a more cheery underscore, as heard on the first soundtrack, the Special Edition credits, and a DVD bonus feature, but the film itself had a more somber underscore, which had been retained on the Special Edition soundtrack.
Adam Mitchell provided the singing voice for the young prince in the 2017 film.
Dan Stevens' portrayal as the Beast in the 2017 film was partially inspired by Wreck-It Ralph.
