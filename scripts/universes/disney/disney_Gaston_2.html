<html><p>Gaston only appears at the end of Belle's flashback in Issue 8, where Gaston welcomes Belle and Maurice back (Mainly Belle), who had gotten lost and barely avoided missing the fair and won first prize due to the Bimbettes sending them on the wrong direction in an attempt to ensure they don't return to the village. He is also mentioned beforehand, as the reason the Bimbettes did that was specifically so they won't have any competition regarding getting Gaston to marry them. Although he never appears in any of the remaining stories themselves after Issue 8, he did briefly appear as a trivia question for the Beautiful and beastly mail section of Issue 9, where he is shown fuming while LeFou is timidly trying to cheer him up. He also appears as a child in Issue 5 of Disney Comic Hits!, also made by Marvel Comics, alongside Belle and the Bimbettes, where he is standing on his sled during a snowy day in an obvious attempt at impressing her (with the Bimbettes trying to get his attention) before he and the Bimbettes ended up crashing into a tree. The narration also had Maurice telling Belle, when giving her a sled, that she can use it to "go sledding with your friends" when it cuts to this scene, which implies that Gaston and Belle may have been friends during childhood.

Kingdom Keepers
Gaston makes a small cameo in the fourth book of the saga. He is seen along with Prince John and the Horned King when Finn and Amanda see all the Overtakers together at Tom Sawyer Island.

Villain Files
Gaston also appears in the tongue-in-cheek book about Disney Villains called The Villain Files. According to the book, he had been vicious since he was a baby (and implied that the bearskin rug was actually created by someone other than Gaston, perhaps his father or grandfather) and met Belle while practicing archery. In addition, in the page depicting him as a baby, he was lying buck-naked on the bearskin rug, which acted as a pun on the phrase "bare on a bearskin rug," which is slang for a nude centerfold.

The Beast Within: A Tale of Beauty's Prince
Gaston appeared in this book by Serena Valentino and given a slightly more sympathetic and tragic portrayal, where it was revealed that he was a former friend of the Prince who would become the Beast. He often hunted with him and hung around the tavern earning the gazes of young women. He was also indirectly responsible for the curse, as he informed the Prince that a woman he was betrothed to, Circe, was a farmer, resulting in the Prince coldly refusing her, as well as her and her sisters deciding to exact revenge by cursing the Prince and his staff. Eventually, Gaston ended up evicted from the castle by the Prince after strange episodes occurred that ruined an attempted betrothal with a princess of a nearby kingdom. Although Gaston did not turn into an object, he was nonetheless affected by the curse in the sense of forgetting his friendship with the Prince. He later ended up attacking the castle, largely due to the manipulations of Circe's sisters who wanted the spell to remain unbroken and was eventually manipulated into stabbing his former friend in the back after Beast spared him, resulting in his death.

Gaston also mentioned a prince from a neighboring kingdom who had a great success "after the matter of the glass slipper was sorted", hinting that Cinderella takes place in the same world as Beauty and the Beast, along with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and The Little Mermaid.

Descendants: Isle of the Lost
Gaston is one of the villains that was brought back to life only to be imprisoned on the Isle of the Lost. He is now the father of twin boys named Gaston Jr. and Gaston the Third; he named them after himself due to his egomania. They even share his personality to some degree, but aren't as obsessed with women; they are even kind to other students. However, it is unknown who his wife was at this point.

In the actual film, Maleficent mentions him in passing, saying he should be jealous of Jay's outfit for Prince Ben's coronation.

As Old as Time (A Twisted Tale)
In As Old as Time (A Twisted Tale), Gaston's role is fairly similar to the original film, up to the point where he has Maurice sent to the asylum. As Belle returned for Maurice slightly later than she did in the film, Gaston's plan to send him to the asylum is a success, and it is revealed that he and D'Arque have a long-term business arrangement of Gaston dealing with various 'problems' for D'Arque. After he burns down the bookshop, Gaston is shocked when the Beast arrives in the tavern to ask the villagers for help rescuing Belle from D'Arque, the Beast using the mirror to expose the brutal conditions in the asylum, where D'Arque essentially tortures his 'patients' to try and remove their magic, even if they only possess some minor gift such as an aunt of LeFou's who made exceptional cakes. Although Gaston is just as shocked at the villagers at the sight of D'Arque's true nature and accepts the Beast's request for help, he soon reverts to type, shooting D'Arque in the back during the raid on the asylum and immediately proposing to Belle again with the explanation that they will end this dark day on a happier note. Belle coolly rejects his offer after confirming that he burned down the bookshop on D'Arque's orders, with the rest of the village rejecting him despite his past reputation after witnessing his brutality, others noting that they would have preferred for D'Arque to be put on trial rather than killed in such a manner.

Princess Adventure Stories
He appears in the storyline "Belle and the Mysterious Monster", where he volunteers (mostly due to his braggart nature) to hunt down a monster that had been plaguing the village, despite Belle's doubts about what was going on. He also sets up various traps, humorously getting himself clumsily set off in one trap. Eventually, Gaston is forced to swallow his pride and relents in trying to kill the monster after the real cause behind the village's current problems turned out to be Babette, the escaped goat of one of the village's denizens, with Belle being the one responsible for this discovery. Belle also makes a smart remark about him fighting monsters next time and putting his traps to use there, much to his chagrin and the other villagers' amusement.

Video games
Belle's Quest
In Belle's Quest, Gaston plays out his role in the film to some degree, though at the start, he appears to be much more tame, even using his strength to assist Belle in a task. Nevertheless, he continues to pursue her in hopes of marrying her, as well as invade the Beast's castle at the conclusion of the game.

Disney Princess
Gaston appears as the villain of Belle's stage. Here, he plots to manipulate the villagers into believing the Beast's castle is evil and should be destroyed. To do so, he breaks into the dark castle and tries to capture Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Potts, hoping to use them as proof of the castle's dark magic. However, Belle is able to defeat him using her quick wits.

Kingdom Hearts
Gaston makes his debut appearance in the Kingdom Hearts series in Kingdom Hearts χ. His role in the game is identical to the film, only he leads an army of Heartless to the castle instead of villagers, and sets the Enraged Elk Heartless to fight the player as he confronts the Beast. He is not directly fought as a boss within the game, although it should be noted that the Enraged Elk Heartless has several notable similarities to Gaston, in overall appearance, hairstyle, and attire, with the primary differences being its skin color and bearing an overall more demonic look.

Despite the events of Kingdom Hearts χ being intended to serve as a projection of future events in the series, Gaston does not appear in Kingdom Hearts II or Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days. In the earliest stages of production, Gaston was intended to appear in Kingdom Hearts II, playing out the same role as in the film and serving as a boss for the series' main protagonist, Sora, but he was cut and his role in the game given to the original character Xaldin.

Disney Magic Kingdoms
Gaston in Disney Magic Kingdoms.
Gaston returns, once again in search of Belle's love. He organizes a trap to lure her to the castle under the guise of Beast, claiming a ball is to be taken place. Fifi the feather duster gets word of this and informs Lumiere, who then warns Cogsworth. They tell the Beast, and he warns Belle of the danger shortly afterward. Even so, Belle goes to the castle to deal with Gaston herself. She rejects him to his face and declares that she has an actual ball to attend, irritating and infuriating Gaston. He goes to sabotage the ball but is defeated by the combined forces of Belle, Beast, and the servants.

Agitated and aggressive as usual, Gaston tries to subdue his anger by going around the Kingdom and flaunting his greatness. Even after doing so, however, he starts to question why Belle would choose a beast over him. He briefly starts to believe he may not be as beautiful as he had always thought, but he looks to regain his confidence by checking himself out in a mirror. This works so well that Gaston forgets why he was so furious in the first place. With his renewed vigor, Gaston makes another attempt (one that's, by choice, considerably less hostile than previous attempts) to win Belle's heart, only to fail once again.

Disney Heroes: Battle Mode
Gaston appears in the fighting video game as one of the unlockable heroes, during the login you could unlock it if you logged in before the latest version, it can also be unlocked by buying gold chests and winning raids in the elite campaign to unlock it, his abilities are the same from the movie also as a fun fact, when he scratches his shirt and during his victory pose, the sound of a mare can be heard.

Other games
In the Super Nintendo game based off of the film, Gaston appears as the final boss. In the final level, Gaston primarily attacks with arrows as the beast must get past the volley of arrows and attack the hunter. During the final phase, Gaston puts away his bow and attacks hand to hand. Unlike the film, the Beast himself sends Gaston plummeting to his death with the final blow.

In Beauty and the Beast: Roar of the Beast, Gaston has led an invasion on the Beast's castle. The final boss is against a knife-wielding Gaston.

Gaston does not appear in Kinect Disneyland Adventures, although he is mentioned by Belle explaining that he hasn't been to Disneyland yet, probably due to the fact that there were no antlers.

In Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion, Gaston was one of the Disney villains the evil witch Mizrabel had the ability to morph into. However, her Gaston disguise only appeared briefly in the intro and never again throughout the rest of the game.

Musical
Donny Osmond portraying Gaston in Beauty and the Beast on Broadway.
Gaston's role and personality in the musical based on the film is pretty much the same—a pompous, sexist, egotistical, boorish, brutish, brainless, and chauvinistic caveman who loves only himself. His ultimate goal is the same too—marry the prettiest girl in town and make her his "little wife" and his "property". Instead of ignoring the Bimbettes like in the film, he pays more attention to them (saying that their 'rendezvouses' will continue after his marriage to Belle, implying adultery) but still wants Belle as his wife, making them very upset (to the point of wailing and crying like infants). During the proposal scene (where there's no wedding party outside unlike the movie), Gaston gives Belle a miniature portrait of himself as a present.

In addition to the song "Gaston", the song "Me" is performed by him (in which he conceitedly proposes to Belle). The song is of interest because one verse implies that his feelings for Belle are more than for her looks (he even calls her 'pumpkin' as an endearing appellative), but he never says it outright to her. In addition, presumably to avoid any implications that the villagers were in the know regarding Gaston's plan to blackmail Maurice, he has all the patrons and staff, except LeFou, leave the tavern before conducting his reprise. The reprise itself was expanded to have Gaston and LeFou brag about Gaston's resourcefulness as well as Gaston fully admitting he doesn't have any remorse to resorting to something as dirty as blackmail to ensure Belle married him, as well as breaking the fourth wall somewhat by having them brag about Gaston being "entertaining" and capable of "keep[ing] up with these endless reprises." Like in the movie, he dies after falling off the roof of the Beast's castle, but not before fatally stabbing him multiple times (as opposed to just once in the movie) after arrogantly lying that Belle sent him to the castle to kill him.

Notable actors who have played the role on Broadway include Burke Moses (who originated the role on Broadway and in the original London production), Marc Kudisch, Christopher Sieber, Cody Carlton, and Donny Osmond (singing voice of Li Shang in Mulan). Other actors include Steve Condie. In the Australian production, the role was first played by Hugh Jackman.

Disney Parks
Walt Disney World
Gaston posing for a photo at Walt Disney World, before his updated costume was revealed.
Since 2012, Gaston has become a common and very popular character within the Walt Disney World Resort. He appears in the live stage show Beauty and the Beast: Live! at Disney's Hollywood Studios. During Halloween, he is a part of Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party at the Magic Kingdom.

He is also seen walking around in the parks, such as walking down the International Gateway. Depending on which Cast Member is portraying him in the parks, his sexism towards women and his opinion on reading and thinking varies depending on who plays him, but he is very popular with female guests and is much nicer to young girls, as he even gives them hugs.

Gaston has his own restaurant, Gaston's Tavern, in the Beauty and the Beast area of the Magic Kingdom's Fantasyland. He can now be found there for meet-and-greets daily, but before 2015 he was the only character present there (though LeFou is mentioned). The Bimbettes can now be met along with him. Before then, Gaston's park appearances were mostly confined to parades, shows, and special events.

Tokyo Disneyland
Gaston plays a notable part in the nighttime castle show Once Upon a Time, where he engages in a battle against the Beast during the show's climax; eventually falling to his death.

Disneyland Paris
At Disneyland Paris, Gaston can be found for meet-and-greets in Fantasyland. He also appears in several shows, specifically during Halloween time.

Hong Kong Disneyland
Gaston appears briefly at the end of Villains Night Out! as one of the villains that were invited by Maleficent.

Gaston appears in Let's Get Wicked, alongside Ursula, Mother Gothel, Cruella De Vil, and Dr. Facilier.

Trivia
While Gaston has no noble status in the final version, it is implied in one scene that he is still wealthy, at least in regard to the other villagers.
In addition, one of the earlier drafts of the post-rewrite film also made his wealth a bit more explicit, where he was apparently a lavish spender, often being extremely careless/reckless in his extravagant endeavors. This resulted in LeFou (here named "LaFou" and acting as his long-suffering family accountant) getting high-strung and neurotic as a result of this as well as Gaston's bullying.

On an interesting note, most of Gaston's actions were edited out of the final cut of the film: during his battle with the Beast, Gaston was originally intended to shout "Time to die!", but it was changed to "Belle is MINE!" (but his lips still mouth "Time to die!") in order to edit violence and get the main point of his rage straight. Also, Gaston's death scene originally had him stabbing the Beast in the back and willingly falling to his death while laughing maniacally, as if satisfied that if he could not have Belle, then neither would the Beast. Though this was changed to Gaston accidentally losing his footing, it appears to explain why Gaston chose such a dangerous and risky position to wound the Beast despite knowing that it would not help him win Belle's heart.
Contrary to popular belief, Gaston himself was not actually based on Avenant, a character from the 1946 French film Beauty and the Beast, played by Jean Marais. Linda Woolverton, the screenwriter for the Disney film, refused to watch the Jean Cocteau version specifically because she didn't want to use it as the source material for the Disney movie. Woolverton had instead based Gaston on several of her own unsuccessful relationships.
Richard White stated in an interview that while he himself doesn't know whether Gaston survived, he does mention that the viewers never saw the body, implying that he might have survived.
The skulls in Gaston's eyes.
However, the 2002 DVD commentary confirmed his death and mentioned that the skull and crossbones are seen in his pupils as he falls.
Interestingly enough, Disney made absolutely certain to remove the skull and crossbones from Gaston's pupils as he fell to his death in the theatrical and VHS version, yet made no attempt to do so in the later releases on DVD and Blu-ray.

The amount of arrows in Gaston's quiver often changes from three to two and sometimes even four.
In the comic adaptation of the film, he never wears his cape and his ponytail stays intact like Belle's even though it is raining.
When Gaston falls, the strap of his quiver on his back is the wrong way round.
Sometimes Gaston's hair is tied back with a brown band.
On the 2011 Cartoon Voices Comic Con, Bill Farmer said that he had done Gaston, during Gaston's song in the bar. Bill did the sound of Gaston eating the eggs.
Notably, until the release of Kingdom Hearts χ, Gaston was the only main antagonist who did not appear in the Kingdom Hearts series despite his homeworld, Beast's Castle, appearing in Kingdom Hearts II and Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days. As Beast is shown to have transformed back into the Prince during the credits of Kingdom Hearts II, it is possible that Gaston's fight against the Beast and subsequent death occurred while Sora, Donald, and Goofy were absent from the world.
Xaldin (an antagonist from Organization XIII and the nobody of Dilan) played the role as the antagonist of Beast's Castle in Kingdom Hearts II in substitute to Gaston (despite the fact that it isn't his homeworld). Although, his intentions were entirely different to Gaston's (being closer to that of Forte, in fact) as Xaldin used the Rose and the Beast's anger to create a Heartless and a Nobody of the Beast to serve Xaldin and only ever used Belle to further pursue his intentions of manipulating the prince by using Belle as bait.
Ironically, his debut appearance, Kingdom Hearts χ, took place eons before the events of Kingdom Hearts II, and was meant to be a projection of future events, supposedly portraying what might have led to his confrontation with Sora in Kingdom Hearts II.

In the book Disney Villains: The Essential Guide, Gaston appears on the very last page, where's he is shown complaining about why he didn't appear in the book.
The trailer implies that Gaston may have been aware of the Beast's curse, and had ulterior motives besides wanting Belle as his wife for attempting to kill the Beast, as the trailer described him as being "one man who wants to keep the spell alive," although it is unconfirmed whether this was the case in the film itself.
Gaston's proposal outfit consisted of a red tailcoat trimmed with gold fabric, a waistcoat, breeches, and even black boots, which implies that the events of the film occurred sometime in the late-17th to mid-18th century. Glen Keane confirmed in the commentary for Beauty and the Beast that the film's setting was indeed intended to be the late 18th century.
At the tavern, besides the aforementioned antler and deer-related trophies, Gaston also had among his hunting trophies a bald eagle's head and a bighorn sheep's head, implying that he may have hunted abroad (as they were not native to his village, France, or even Europe, being instead native to North America). This was further supported by his first appearance in the film, where some of the kills carried by LeFou included a raccoon (although raccoons technically were present in France via the French-German border, they weren't part of France's ecosystem at the time until two pet raccoons were released into the wild at Germany in the 1930s).
Gaston is the opposite of the Beast. While the Beast is an ugly monster based on his appearance, he actually has a good heart and truly cared for Belle. Gaston, on the other hand, while being superficially handsome on the outside and praised by the populace, is actually egotistical and male-chauvinistic, and only wanted to marry Belle based purely on her beauty, and eventually allowed his obsessive lust to make him a villain in which is why Belle rightfully labelled him as the real monster when he called the Beast one himself. One of the filmmakers even described Gaston as having "the heart of a pig" due to his sloven behavior during his proposal to Belle.
In addition, after he falls into the mud pond during the failed proposal, a pig's head rises up before Gaston's head emerges, acting as a slight pun on "pigheaded", alluding to extreme stubbornness and stupidity.
In fact, Gaston can be seen as representing the sort of person that the Beast would've almost ended up becoming if he had never met the Enchantress and Belle, nor did he change his arrogant and selfish ways.

Gaston has blue eyes, the same eye color as the Beast. So far in Disney history, this is the only time the villain has had any physical features (i.e. eye color, hair color, etc.) as a protagonist.
Before "Me" in the Broadway version begins, Gaston mentions to the Silly Girls that their "rendezvouses" will continue after he marries Belle, suggesting that he would be unfaithful and that he is an adulterer. He is the first Disney villain to conspire to commit adultery, at least in a Disney musical. In addition, one of the lyrics for the “Gaston” song in the first draft of Woolverton's treatment of the film was "Who breaks hearts like Gaston", implying that he may have committed some indiscretions with various females in the village.
Despite various concept materials, as listed above, give Gaston the surname of LeGume, the Bimbettes during the song of "Belle" refer to Gaston as "Monsieur Gaston" and Belle in the reprise twice sarcastically refers to herself as "Madame Gaston" suggesting that Gaston is his surname in the final version.
Although no character like Gaston originated in the original tale, the name itself was originally used in the first known tale written by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve, the original author of the fairy tale, and was a reference to "Gaston Phoebus", full name "Gaston III de Foix-Béarn" and also known as "Comte de Foix". Similar to Gaston in the Disney version, Gaston Phoebus was also a renowned and expert hunter, and was even used as a book-reference to the book "The Art of Hunting".
Rupert Everett and Patrick Swayze were both considered for the voice of Gaston. Everett was turned down because he didn't sound "arrogant enough." He eventually made sure to sound as arrogant as possible when voicing Prince Charming in Shrek 2 and Shrek the Third, whose narcissism was coincidentally very similar to Gaston, although Charming's motives and vindictive traits were more in resemblance to Jafar (as he only wanted Fiona for the throne and seized it in the same manner).
According to the creators, Gaston's primary color was red to symbolize evil to contrast with Belle and Beast's blue attires.
Ironically, in the film's original screenplay, Gaston was shown wearing blue.
The Beast himself, before falling in love with Belle, wears mostly purple, which is a mix of blue and red.

In the Disney cruise line show Villains Tonight, Hades mentions Gaston and compares him to actor Charlie Sheen.
His original last name LeGume is a pun on his "pea-brained" insight and views of women.
When the objects attack the mob in the castle, Gaston's cape disappears.
