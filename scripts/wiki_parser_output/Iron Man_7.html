Sudden Heart Attack
Stark argues with Alexander Pierce
In an alternate 2012, after defeating Loki in the Battle of New York, Stark helped Thor and S.H.I.E.L.D. escort him out of Stark Tower, as well as personally holding onto the Tesseract. When the group reached the first floor, they ran into Alexander Pierce, who demanded they hand over custody of Loki and the Tesseract.

Stark suffers a sudden heart attack
An argument then broke out between Stark and Pierce, who then tried to physically confiscate the Tesseract case from Stark. However, this was disrupted when Stark suddenly experienced a heart attack, which was caused by Ant-Man from 2023 tampering with his Arc Reactor. He then collapsed to the ground seizing as the onlookers called for a medic. Fortunately, Stark was was saved when Thor used Mjølnir to send a shock through his body. They then realized that Loki, along with the Tesseract, had mysteriously disappeared.[14]

Personality
Many people in the media thought that Tony Stark was only just an egocentric playboy. As an adult, he was renowned for being casually arrogant, apathetic, callous, and a hedonist who enjoyed the finer things in life, namely drinking, gambling, partying and flirting. His wealth, power, and natural charm allowing him to get just about any woman he wants. But despite his rather carefree and overly confident personality, inside Stark's heart lied loneliness, as Ho Yinsen aptly described him as: "A man that has everything, but has nothing." Even following his reformation and birth as Iron Man, this stigma surrounding Stark persisted as many were quick to point fingers at him believing his arrogance and callous attitudes were the cause of many problems even if he would have only a tenuous connection to the issue at hand.

Before his kidnapping, Stark was a self-centered, arrogant person who didn't truly care for many people other than his closest friends. Even during this period of his life, he had a moral code believing the weapons he developed were being used exclusively by the United States and its allies for peaceful purposes but never knew they were on the black market. He also funded large humanitarian inventions and programs via his arms dealings, something he felt justified manufacturing weapons.

During the following years, however, Stark matured, gradually becoming more of a team player and becoming somewhat less arrogant and cynical. He even began opening up and having a real relationship with Pepper Potts. Stark's exploits as Iron Man have lead him to reevaluate his life, thus he now strives to use his inventions in a more responsible and considerate way. A textbook example of a Byronic hero, he never fully let go of his character flaws, however, using them to push him forward as a reminder to do better and often making self-deprecating jokes or comments. Despite this attitude, Stark is an exceptionally brave and selfless individual as shown when he single-handedly faced a near-omnipotent Thanos armed with nothing but a knife without hesitation, a trait that earned him the Titan's genuine respect as a hero.

His experiences while imprisoned by the Ten Rings, especially his injury and seeing his weapons being used by terrorists, hardened Stark into a brave, determined, and somewhat ruthless fighter. Seeing first hand how innocent people were being harmed by his weapons and business while he remained ignorant greatly enraged him and motivated him to become a better man. He was also willing to kill to protect his allies and friends, boldly saying he would kill Drax if Star-Lord killed Spider-Man. Despite this, he was not cold-hearted nor entirely merciless, as he offered several of Aldrich Killian's men a chance to stand down and allowing the sole survivor to leave peacefully upon surrendering. Even when confronted by Captain America's betrayal, he offered the man several chances to step aside.

Even after starting a new life as a superhero, Stark kept his sense of humor and his penchant for showmanship, the latter being demonstrated in his armor’s red and gold color schemes, and in revealing his identity in public despite being told not to. Tony has also shown a strong liking towards heavy metal and rock music groups like Black Sabbath, AC/DC, and Queen. He also shows signs of being a gearhead owning and modifying several expensive cars, having a particular liking towards the Audi R8 model line.

Stark was also known for being exceptionally intelligent, innovative and resourceful, having built a miniaturized Arc Reactor from scratch in Afghanistan. His intellect earned him the "Da Vinci of Our Time" nickname, and his inventions of Stark Industries have revolutionized technology for mankind. His past as a businessman had turned him into a very pragmatic individual always taking the quickest, most efficient way out of a problem commenting to Captain America that he would simply "cut the wire" when given the scenario of laying on barbed wire to let others cross it. This behavior put him at odds with the majority of the Avengers during the Avengers Civil War, as they were unwilling to compromise and negotiate with the United Nations regarding the Sokovia Accords which Stark viewed as the easiest way to continue the Avengers' mission of saving people and appease the public's growing fear and unease regarding the team. As a result of this negotiator attitude, Tony was one of three Avengers to not become a fugitive by the end of the Civil War and allowed to continue saving people with the support of the United Nations. This pragmatism extended to his fighting style. Stark also prefers accuracy and efficiency. He further displayed his combative pragmatism during the Battle of Titan by first restraining the Infinity Gauntlet before unleashing an unrelenting barrage on Thanos.

Stark could also be a reliable friend, and occasionally showed affection toward his teammates. Hence, Stark was the only Avenger who encouraged Bruce Banner to embrace his identity of Hulk as a blessing rather than a curse, and trusted him to make good use of Hulk's powers. He has also adopted a mentor role towards Peter Parker, seeing himself in the young hero, and helping him become better by designing an advanced Spider-Man Suit and quietly teasing him about his aunt May Parker, whom Stark considers attractive, Tony was in fact the only Avenger who believed in Parker and sought out his aid. When Tony was caught up by the terrifying vision of Scarlet Witch, he was possessed and haunted with great fear of losing all his fellow Avengers while he could have done something to save them, and having to live on after they had all been murdered, which was the primary motivator of him starting the Ultron Program. During the Avengers Civil War, however, Tony became distant and hardened towards his former teammates, especially Captain America, for their stubbornness, although he still cares for them nevertheless. When they fought in Siberia, Tony tried to avoid hurting Rogers, who aggressively protected Barnes, destroying Tony’s arc reactor to do so. Both Stark and Rogers never fully lost their trust in each other, but the former would be angry at Rogers for years, lashing out at him after The Snap and blaming him for tearing the team apart. Tony had lashed out at his friends as well as he told them that their situation was exactly why they needed a suit of armor around the world. Five years later, Stark had gotten over these bad feelings towards his friends.

After the Battle of New York, Stark developed a strong fear, that in this new world of "gods" and "aliens," he would be unable to protect the ones he loves, which induced him to become paranoid and full of anxiety, which, in turn, influenced Stark to build the first Iron Legion, and then the Ultron AI, so that the only threats against Earth were from Earth itself. Despite good intentions, Stark's plans to protect people tend to cause problems at times, most notably after his creation Ultron violently rebelled against humankind, requiring the combined might of Stark and his Avengers teammates to bring down. His fear gave him something of a perfectionist personality and caused him to so intently focus on issues and problems that he unconsciously ignored other matters around him which led to a strain in his relationship with Pepper Potts and his somewhat negative reputation in the Avengers. The trauma from New York came back to haunt him when he learned Thanos was responsible for the invasion. His grudge played a part in the Mad Titan succeeding in his plans. Recognizing this, Tony toned down this resentment, as when facing the 2014 Thanos, he treated them just like any other villain and was ultimately able to outsmart the much more arrogant Thanos, getting his revenge by not wasting any time before he snapped his fingers to wipe him and his armies out and instead simply proclaiming his identity as Iron Man.

Compared to his fellow Avengers, however, Tony was very forward-thinking, always seeing a "big picture," willing to take risks, compromise his morals and dabble in shades of gray to achieve results. As seen with the Sokovia Accords, Stark was willing to endure hardships in the present to build a better future. He also believed not without merit, that he could 'fix anything', which was why he supported the Accords, but didn't completely think it through, assuming that the more extreme aspects of the Accords would only be used on villains and not the heroes even after some of his fellow heroes were locked up under it. This behavior often put him at odds with his fellow Avengers, especially Captain America, who were content with the status quo. Combined with his unpredictability, some people such as Scarlet Witch thought he was destructive, with her claiming that Ultron's inability to distinguish between saving the world and destroying it comes from Tony. 

During times of great stress and frustration, Stark could become very short-tempered and intolerant of those whom he considered his intellectual inferiors for delaying a solution to the problem either mocking/berating them or ignoring them entirely. This behavior extended to both allies and foes.

Stark was much closer to his mother, Maria Stark, than to his father Howard with whom he had mixed feelings for, as he thought he was "cold and distant," which Nick Fury, however, claimed to be false. He still cared for him a great deal as he wished he could’ve said goodbye. While he was researching a new element for his Arc Reactor, Tony came across a message left by Howard, telling his son that his “greatest creation” was him.

Though having learned more of Howard's flaws and shortcomings, Stark still retained lingering issues with his father using his parenting as an excuse for being such a strict mentor to Spider-Man. He was aware of this flaw, however, and consciously attempted to grow out of it. During the Time Heist, after talking with his father Howard and realizing how difficult it was for Howard to raise him due to having an abusive father as well and having had experiences as a father, Tony finally came to reconcile with Howard and even shed his façade temporarily by hugging his father and saying that he loved him.

Following the Avengers Civil War, Stark adapted into a new role: that of a mentor to the inexperienced superhero, Spider-Man. He connected with Parker due to the similarities between that of him and Stark, such as their love of science, technology, and heroic deeds, yet Stark was not blind to Spider-Man sharing some of his flaws and does his best to stop him from making the same mistakes Iron Man himself has made in the past. Like most mentors, Stark encourages Parker to be more forward-thinking and imaginative with his abilities while also being conscious of Peter's limitations and wanting to keep him out of fights he felt were too dangerous. Though he could come off as somewhat aloof and detached in his dealings with Spider-Man, this was all done with the intent of making Parker a better superhero than Tony ever was, and after the defeat of Vulture, Stark believed he had succeeded even going so far as to offer the young hero a spot in the Avengers. Some months later, their relationship had strengthened to the point that Stark was openly saddened by Parker's death upon Thanos' completion of the Infinity Gauntlet.

Though considered a hobby, obsession or part of his itinerary, Stark considers the relationship between the Iron Man Suit and himself to be symbiotic, in that he and the suit himself are one. By the time of Aldrich Killian's terrorist attack, he had designed 42 variations of the armor as well as having stylized them with their own color designs, personalities, and names. He often referred to his suit as "he" when he was remotely controlling it with Potts and exclaimed when the suit's finger was pulled off, claiming it would hurt him. This is further supported during and after the Avengers Civil War whereupon the armors became incredibly streamlined and were designed to emulate a second skin. However, he does claim after the Clean Slate Protocol, that despite being without his suits he is still Iron Man.

In spite of his love of the spotlight, the idea of a normal life intrigued Tony greatly as he made attempts to extradite himself from the Iron Man persona and indeed, prior to his involvement in the Infinity War, pondered the possibility of he and Pepper having children together. After the disastrous outcome of the Infinity War, Tony indeed decided to retire and marry Pepper, having a daughter called Morgan Stark. His familial life allowed Tony to find a sense of peace and contentment as a husband and father and this was the primary reason of his refusal to to return to being a superhero when presented with a potential chance to undo it all but in the end his guilt over Parker's death allowed him to overcome this and he showed the same amount of selflessness as he had before, willingly sacrificing himself to kill Thanos and his whole army. Despite the agonizing pain he was subjected to as he died, he had accepted his fate, not bothering to try to make his wife, his protégé, his best friend and his fellow comrades do something about it, instead finding comfort in their presence as he spent his last moments and with his last words being to comfort them that they had won, showing no regrets that he had to die for it to happen, and Pepper assuring that she and her daughter along with the rest of the world would be alright, died peacefully.

Powers and Abilities
Tony Stark did not possess any innate powers; instead, he used a miniature version of the Arc Reactor to charge the various suits that provided him with superhuman strength, endurance, durability, and a variety of weapons. His original advanced technology combined with his extraordinary intelligence and adaptive combat skills made Tony Stark one of the most formidable superheroes in the world. Aside from Thor and Doctor Strange, Tony Stark was the third person to stand his ground and fought the Infinity Gauntlet empowered Thanos the longest, even managing to give him a cut on his cheek and earn the respect and admiration of Thanos himself.

Armor Capabilities
Design
With the exception of the Mark I Iron Man armor, almost all of the Iron Man suits shared a common design and capability set. The suit was a powered exoskeleton with armored plating, capable of enhancing the wearer's strength, speed, agility, and endurance. The suit was powered by a miniaturized Arc Reactor, either using the one surgically installed in Tony Stark's chest or else built into the chest-piece of the armor itself.

The original armor Tony Stark created, the Iron Man Armor: Mark I, while in captivity in Afghanistan was crudely designed and bulky, but still had the necessary capacity to help him escape his captors. It was bulletproof, had two built-in flamethrowers, a rocket launcher, as well as rocket boosters for short-range flight, though their construction was faulty and they malfunctioned almost immediately after activation. Like all of Stark's armors, the Mark I enhanced Stark's physical strength beyond the capabilities of any human, allowing him to effortlessly overpower and kill multiple Ten Rings insurgents, break through stone walls, bend metal, and exert many tons of force. The armor's durability and resilience allowed it to be unfazed by bullets, tank shells, explosions, and extreme amounts of impactive force, such as impact from falling at high altitudes. Due to its rudimentary design, and Stark's lack of more sophisticated resources, the Mark I did not have an onboard AI system or augmented-reality (AR) displays like the later armors.

The helmet served only as a simple faceplate and was not fully sealed. Stark refashioned the special iron-copper-magnesium alloy from disassembled Stark mortar cannons into the Mark I armor, rendering it bulletproof. To power the thrusters on the boots, Stark siphoned the propellant fuel from four S-class ballistic missiles into two M-class mortars, creating two homemade fuel tanks, welded shut except for the valves connecting fuel hoses that led down the armor's legs.

The later model armors' helmet featured a retractable visor that projected a holographic AR displays to the wearer. The features of the helmet roughly resembled a human face, with eyepieces and a mouth slit showing the point where the faceplate meets the jaw.

The armor's primary weapon, as well as means of propulsion, was repulsor nodes built into the hands and feet. The repulsors in the boots provided the majority of the propulsion force while the nodes in the armor's gauntlets were used as flight stabilizers. Due to the intense heat and concussive pressure produced by the repulsors, the ones built into the gauntlets were also used as weapons, capable of neutralizing or killing enemies depending on the intensity projected. When needed, the primary repulsor built into the armor's breastplate could be charged to deliver a powerful, destructive unibeam blast.

The Mark II was built from basic titanium alloys, giving it a silver look. From the Mark III onward, Stark used a gold-titanium alloy to provide the necessary power-to-weight ratio coupled with the ability to resist icing at high altitudes. As the gold-colored suit seemed a bit ostentatious, Stark took to coloring certain segments of the armor hot-rod red to tone it down a bit without losing the flair he was known for. Later suits were given a variety of colors, from blue to black to green and even yellow and purple.

Until the development of Mark V, Stark focused on refining basic systems shared by all later models, ignoring the ease of putting on and taking off armors, resulting in Mark II, III, and IV all having lengthy and uncomfortable suit-up and suit-off periods. The Mark V marked Stark's first attempt at making his armors easily available when he needed to put them on outside. However, Mark V was experimental in nature and built specifically for testing out new technologies addressing suit-up problems. Couple that with its compact and lightweight form, proved underpowered in terms of functionality. Stark designed and constructed a ring specifically for easily donning and taking off his Mark VI armor until he can finally solve the issue without compromising on functionality.

It wasn't until the Mark VII that the issue was finally resolved, through enabling armors to move in one whole set on its own without the user in it, and open up to fit the user inside when needed, allowing Stark to don his armor within seconds for the first time. All Iron Man armors made since then were built with this ease-of-donning feature perfected in Mark VII, with each armor design allowing the individual parts of the suit to form around Stark, assembling itself over him with ease. This culminated in the Mark L, which used nanotechnology to seamlessly materialize the armor over Stark. The design philosophy had the added benefit of being able to control the armors via remote control, effectively making the armors into humanoid drones.

Performance and functionality-wise, through the design of the Mark XI, Stark stuck with a basic design and aesthetic, merely improving the technology and increasing the weapons' capabilities. From the Mark XI onward, he began crafting armors with specialized capabilities, beginning with stealth systems. By the time he built the Mark XV, he began giving the armors individual names to better identify them among the ever-growing set and in terms of their specialized abilities.

Iron Man Armors

Stark used his technologically sophisticated armors to become Iron Man. The many systems of the armors allowed him to fly at supersonic speeds and contained various weapons for battle. He frequently improved the technology put into his armors, giving them upgrades for battles and to perfect the onboard systems. He had created a collection of suits for him to choose from; some are mission-specific or prototypes for testing out various capabilities, others are older models kept for nostalgia or for research. As the multi-billionaire head of a global corporation and a genius-level inventor, Tony Stark could procure or develop the additional technology needed as soon as possible. The Iron Man Armor is arguably one of the most powerful man-portable weapons on the planet.

Alone, the Mark I was sufficient enough to allow him to go through armed terrorists in order to escape. The Mark II was sufficiently powerful enough to go toe to toe with a more advanced and updated version of the armor (the Mark IV). The Mark III was able to easily dispatch some of the Ten Rings terrorists with ease and battle the Iron Monger Armor, albeit with some difficulty (due to the fact that it was powered by the first generation mini-Arc Reactor and the Iron Monger was powered by the second Arc Reactor he made upon his return). The Mark V, while lacking additional weaponry and flight capabilities, was still able to take on Ivan Vanko while he was just utilizing just the first Whiplash Armor, with Stark relying primarily on his repulsors. The Marks VI and VII proved to be the most powerful generation suits used by Stark at the time.

They were powerful enough to battle hordes of Hammer Drones, Vanko with his own advanced Whiplash armor, survive and battle two Asgardian gods (Thor and Loki, respectively) and hordes of Chitauri foot soldiers and a Leviathan with ease. The Marks 8 through 42, most of which were not even built for combat, proved nonetheless to be a significantly more powerful generation suits as they were able to battle nanotech-enhanced human soldiers, who themselves had enough strength and combat capabilities to match any of the armors.
